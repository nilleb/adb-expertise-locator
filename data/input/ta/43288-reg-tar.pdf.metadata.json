INTRODUCTION \n1.  This technical assistance (TA) is to foster more effective infrastructure development in \nthe West Asia developing member countries (DMCs) by improving their land acquisition and \nresettlement (LAR) performance. This will be accomplished by (i) providing a capacity building \nprogram  to  increase  the  understanding  of  governments  and  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs) of the LAR aspects of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) and LAR improvements needed in each DMC; (ii) promoting country ownership of sound \nLAR; (iii) narrowing gaps between local practice and ADB policy; and (iv) developing procedures \nand technical tools to prepare and execute better resettlement plans. The TA is consistent with \nthe  2009  ADB  Safeguard  Policy  Statement1 and  the  2006  special  evaluation  study  of  the \nIndependent  Evaluation  Department 2 and  supports  Strategy  2020 3 and  the  2005  Paris \nDeclaration agenda.4  \n \n2.  ADB has financed similar TA projects5 but, except for Pakistan, they never involved \nDMCs in the region covered by ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department (CWRD). Moreover, \nthese  efforts  had  mixed  results  in  improving  LAR  performance  as  they  provided  only \nassessments,  recommendations,  or  draft  country  policies  or  policy  agendas.  This  TA \nincorporates  lessons  from  these  past  efforts,  but  focuses  primarily  on  LAR  improvements \nobtainable  under  existing  laws,  such  as  solving  administrative  bottlenecks,  improving \ncoordination,  and  providing  technical  know-how.  Discussions  with  executing  agencies, \nconsultants,  and  NGOs  during  project  missions  confirm  the  TA's  relevance  and  the \ngovernments\u2019 support for the initiative. Specific agreements with each government on their \nparticipation in the TA programs will be obtained during TA inception. The TA design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Of  the  factors  involved  in  infrastructure  development,  LAR  is  a  main  cause  of \ndevelopment  partner\u2013client  disagreements,  delays,  and  stakeholder  complaints.  This  is \nespecially the case in Central and West Asia where, since CWRD was established, infrastructure \nprojects with intensive LAR have constantly increased, but LAR capacity remains weak. Most \nDMCs in the region are unfamiliar with ADB policy. They maintain LAR practices that are \nobsolete or imperfectly recognize private property. They also lack institutional, administrative, or \ntechnical  tools  to  execute  LAR  effectively  and  based  on  sound  international  standards. \nTherefore, maximizing the benefits of new infrastructure in the region requires overhauling local \nLAR practices. The need is urgent and requires resources and dedicated efforts.7  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009. Safeguards Policy Statement. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2006.

Technical Assistance for Capacity \nBuilding for Resettlement Risk Management. Manila. (TA 6091-REG). \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 October 2009. \n7  The  TA  consultants  will  prepare  comprehensive  assessments  and  sustained  capacity  building  programs \naddressing country and cross-sector issues. This cannot be done by project preparatory TA or supervision \nconsultants who focus on project-specific tasks and encounter great difficulties in their work exactly because the \nLAR-enabling environment to be delivered by the TA is missing. \n \n ", "2   \n4.  One area where LAR complicates the preparation and implementation of projects is legal. \nMost DMCs have laws that do not support the ADB policy's compensation or rehabilitation \nstandards. These differences slow loan processing and mar negotiations. Moreover, even if \nagreements  are  clear  in  loan  covenants,  they  do  not  guarantee  that  LAR  is  implemented \naccording to ADB standards. Local governments, which usually are responsible for LAR, do not \nsign loan agreements nor understand ADB policy and are thus unable to implement it or are \nafraid they will break the law if they do so. To overcome these obstacles, ADB may engage in \nlegal reform to bring national laws in line with ADB policy. Efforts and dialogue in this direction \nare surely necessary, but will provide results only in the long term. Legal reform is complex and \ndepends on independent parliamentary action or political interests, and establishing strong \ncountry systems and country ownership of improved LAR dynamics requires gradual change.  \n \n5.  In parallel with these long-term efforts, quicker LAR improvement may be pursued within \nexisting country systems by addressing other causes of poor LAR: for instance, how current \nlaws are implemented or the lack of conducive environments for law implementation. These \nefforts may target a generalized DMC rigidity to creatively handle existing laws or regulations. In \nthis  sense,  proper  legal  advice  can  facilitate  policy  negotiations  by  convincing  DMCs  that \nexisting laws can actually support ADB policy provisions that are not in the laws but are only of \na technical nature.8 Better LAR can also be sought by establishing streamlined procedures, \nproper planning mechanisms, or more effective interagency coordination. Often poor LAR rests \non its relegation as an external or secondary factor in project development; on the priority given \nto civil works schedules over LAR schedules; on the fact that executing agencies have no LAR \noffices or, if they do, they are weakly staffed and trained; and on the dependency of LAR tasks \non  many  separate  and  uncoordinated  participants.9 In  these  circumstances,  LAR  may  be \nunsystematic, slowly executed, or a source of complaints. To improve this situation, agreement \nmust be reached with the DMC on (i) developing templates synchronizing LAR, civil works, and \ndisbursement  schedules;  (ii)  preparing  implementation-ready  resettlement  plans  before \nconstruction contracts are binding; and (iii) ensuring that all affected parties are compensated \nbefore civil works begin. Equally important is to set up LAR units within the executing agencies \nwith clear mandates and capacity; establish agreed mechanisms ensuring coordination; and \ndevelop operating modalities leading to the involvement of all concerned parties in each project \nphase, including preparation, implementation, and negotiations with development partners.  \n \n6.  Another source of poor LAR practice is the inadequacy of technical tools or know-how. \nLAR preparation is slowed by inaccurate maps, corrections to badly executed surveys, or weak \npublic  participation  skills.  Lack  of  sound  asset  valuation  methods  may  limit  compensation \noptions and cause lengthy discussions or complaints before a resettlement plan is acceptable. \nFinally,  poor  resettlement  plan  conceptualization  may  require  repeated  rewritings  delaying \nproject or contract approval. These difficulties can be solved by training or technical innovation \ncarried out in formal sessions and ad hoc studies. To be truly successful and leave durable \nresults, such initiatives are to be supported by sustained coaching and assistance during the \napplication of new skills and techniques in actual project work. \n                                                 \n8  An example is common resistance of borrowers to prepare resettlement plans based on the argument that they are \nnot mandated by national laws. These arguments may be dispelled by showing that all LAR laws require proper \nimpact assessments and that a resettlement plan is only a more comprehensive and systematic instrument to meet \nthe same requirement. Another example is the claim in some countries that legally land compensation in cash is \nimpossible when actually the law is silent on this matter and the problem depends on the lack of accepted land \nvaluation methodologies, which in itself is a technical issue.    \n9  Executing agencies tend to focus on the financial and civil works aspects of a project, but leave direct responsibility \nfor LAR tasks (for which they are often unprepared) to consultants or to national land acquisition agencies and local \ngovernments.  In  turn  these  latter  institutions  are  not  involved  in  the  negotiations  with  ADB  nor  know  the \nrequirements of ADB policy. \n ", "  3\n \n7.  Finally, LAR is a most common source of reputational risks. Complaints from affected \npeople may involve weak consultation and information, inadequacy of compensation rates or \ndelivery, and divergences between LAR implementation and resettlement plan stipulations. \nAlso, complaints may be sometimes unjustified, be easily solved, or be so problematic that they \nbring a project to a standstill. Yet, regardless of their gravity, complaints always complicate and \nslow  project  implementation,  cause  costs,  and  erode  citizen  confidence  in  institutions.  To \nimprove this, executing agencies must fully consult with the affected people, properly disclose \nproject documents, and when necessary take action to correct mistakes. To simplify and reduce \ndelays in resolving complaints, the executing agencies and NGOs lodging the complaints must \nbe well prepared to relate to each other. This requires that executing agencies are properly \ntrained in grievance handling, public participation, and public relations; and NGOs are trained on \nhow to raise issues in such a way as to elicit prompt response from the executing agencies \nthrough clear descriptions and substantiation of the issues at stake.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA's impact will be more effective infrastructure development in the Central and \nWest Asia DMCs. Its outcome will be improved LAR practices in the DMCs through greater \nunderstanding  of  the  ADB  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  and  ownership  of  sound  LAR \npractices, enhanced LAR procedures and agency coordination and capacity; simpler project \npreparation and implementation dynamics, more timely disbursement, and reduced reputational \nrisks. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Output  1.  Country-specific  assessment  of  LAR  practice  and  action  plan  for \ncapacity building. In each participating DMC, the TA will provide (i) greater awareness of the \ndifferences between ADB policy and local LAR needs and regulation; (ii) understanding of local \nLAR  practice  and  related  institutional  or  technical  factors  affecting  LAR  effectiveness  or \ncompliance with ADB policy; and (iii) agreement on capacity building needs to improve LAR. \nThis will be obtained through a country assessment study, and an institutional and technical \ncapacity building plan. \n \n10.  Output  2.  Country-specific  alignment  of  policy  and  enhancement  of  LAR \nadministration  and  procedures.  In  each  participating  DMC,  the  TA  will  lead  to  tangible \nadvancements  in  policy  alignment  and  LAR  institutional  capacity.  The  output  will  result  in \n(i) enhancement of LAR mechanisms not requiring legal reform (procedures, implementing rules, \ninteragency modalities of action); (ii) preparation of an agenda for changes requiring new or \namended  laws  and  bring  each  DMC  to  the  position  to  borrow  ADB  funds  for  LAR;  and  \n(iii) improvement in DMC\u2013NGO partnerships and aid coordination. This output will require (i) the \nestablishment of a LAR focal group in each DMC, (ii) periodic consultation with the focal group, \n(iii) workshops, and (iv) preparation of templates for modified practices and procedures agreed \nupon by executing agencies or other government agencies.  \n \n11.  Output 3. Country-specific improvement of technical instruments for LAR. The \ntechnical capacity building program will provide each DMC with greater capacity for improved \nresettlement plan planning, faster implementation, surveys, and asset valuation; and mainstreamed \nmechanisms for stakeholder consultation and complaints handling. The output will include (i) a \n ", "4   \nshort-term  training  program  for  national  and  local  land  administration  agencies,  executing \nagencies, and NGOs to be carried out through formal training sessions, case studies, field visits, \nand  workshops;  (ii)  a  medium-term  coaching  and  training  on-the-job  program  involving \nprotracted assistance to executing agencies of ADB projects during project preparation and \nimplementation; (iii) preparation of terms of reference for the establishment of capable LAR \nteams in land administration agencies and/or selected executing agencies; and (iv) training of \nnational consultants and establishment of a roster of capable national specialists.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $5,000,000 equivalent to be fully provided on a \ngrant basis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV).10 The governments will \nprovide focal group members' salaries and cover other costs in kind. Detailed cost estimates \nand the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  All countries in the CWRD region will be invited to participate in the TA, but the extent \nand specifics of activities may vary from country to country based on local needs. ADB will be \nthe executing agency. Country support will be provided by the resident missions, the regional \noffice  in  Almaty,  and  the  liaison  office  in  Ashgabat.  In  each  country,  a  focal  group  with \nrepresentatives of land administration and line agencies, selected local governments, NGOs, \nand other development partners will help with TA activities including ensuring government \nfeedback and facilitation of government decision-making processes; cross-departmental liaison; \nand assistance in planning meetings, workshops, and training. No TA activity will commence in \nany participating DMC until the DMC provides a no-objection letter. \n \n14.  The TA will last 48 months (February 2010 to February 2014), including (i) a 6-month \ninception period to determine DMC participation and hire the consultants; (ii) 36 months of \nactual TA delivery; and (iii) 6 months to close the TA. The ADB  project team leader will \nsupervise the TA with the assistance, for Pakistan, of the ADB social safeguards team at the \nPakistan Resident Mission. Overall TA coordination and field activities will be assigned to \nconsultants engaged on an individual basis in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time).11 Overall coordination will be carried out by \none  international  TA  coordinator  and  one  national  TA  administrator  located  at  ADB \nheadquarters. Field activities will be carried out by four subregional teams, of which two will \ncover one country each (Pakistan and Afghanistan) and two will cover a country-grouping:  \n(i) Central Asia cluster: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, \nand (ii) Caucasus cluster: Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. The subregional teams will be \nbased at resident missions or relevant regional or liaison offices. Each subregional team will \ninclude  one  international  specialist  and  team  leader  (who,  for  country-groupings,  may  be \nassisted by other international specialists as needed) plus one national specialist for each \ncountry. National experts on land law, asset valuation, land mapping, or other topics emerging \nas relevant during TA implementation may be hired in each country during TA implementation.  \n                                                 \n10  Cofinancing options were explored but no other funds for social development or safeguards were found. \n11  Consultants' engagement under a firm or through an indefinite delivery contract format was considered. However to \nlimit costs; overcome the lack of firms specialized in resettlement; and fit TA activities which are country-specific \nand integrated in a process entailing assessment, planning, and implementation tasks, individual consultants will \nbe engaged. To manage the complex handling of activities involving so many DMCs, a strong TA coordination \nteam will be established at ADB headquarters.  \n \n ", "  5\n \n15.  The international TA coordinator will work intermittently for 24 person-months and the \nnational TA administrator intermittently for 36 person-months. The international specialists for \nthe subregional teams will work intermittently for 7 person-months in each country; except for \nPakistan, where they will work for 11 person-months, and Turkmenistan, where they will work \nfor 2 person-months (total 69 months). The national specialists will be hired on a continuous \nbasis for 36 person-months in each country except for Turkmenistan where they will work only 6 \nperson-months (total 330 person-months). International and national specialists will be located \nat ADB resident missions, and regional or liaison offices. The outline terms of reference for \nconsultants are included in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  TA implementation will be divided into three phases: (i) phase 1, lasting up to 6 months \nfor each country, will deliver the country study and capacity building action plan; (ii) phase 2 will \nbe  carried  out  in  each  country  except  (at  least  initially)  Turkmenistan,  and  will  last  up  to  \n24 months to implement the institutional and technical capacity building programs; and (iii) \nphase  3,  entailing  on-the-job  assistance  to  executing  agencies,  will  also  initially  exclude \nTurkmenistan and will start in parallel with phase 2, but will not be contingent on the success of \nphase 1 and will continue until the end of TA activities. The international specialists will directly \nparticipate in phases 1 and 2. Phase 3 will be carried out by the national specialists. At TA \ncompletion, the team leaders will carry out a 15-day mission for each country and/or country \ngrouping  under  his/her  supervision  to  conduct  an  evaluation  of  the  TA  with  the  national \nconsultant. \n \n17.  The TA will generate several knowledge products to be disseminated among executing \nagencies and civil society organizations through workshops, training manuals, and TA country \nreports. \n \n18.  The TA will require thorough monitoring. Where possible, the TA will make use of project \nperformance reports and quarterly implementation reports of projects with LAR implemented in \nthe TA countries. For indicators that are not included in standard ADB reporting documents, the \nTA will make use of a TA performance monitoring system to be designed by the international TA \ncoordinator during the inception phase. The monitoring data will be filled in ad hoc forms by the \nnational consultants or by project officers quarterly. The international TA coordinator will be \nresponsible for preparing quarterly reports based on this monitoring data. At the end of the TA, \nthe international and national consultants will prepare a TA country evaluation report. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n19.   The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  the  provision  of  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $5,000,000 on a grant basis for Mainstreaming Land \nAcquisition and Resettlement Safeguards in the Central and West Asia Region.  \n \n ", "6     Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources/   \n    Reporting   \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets/Indicators Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nEffective infrastructure  Implementation of projects on time  ADB results  DMC commitment to \ndevelopment  and with appropriate  framework  infrastructure development \n \n  compensation and rehabilitation to  and inclusive growth  \nProject evaluation   \nthe affected people.  \nreports (project  Risks \ncompletion report,  Lack of counterpart financing \n \nPPR) \nPoor external monitoring \n \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nLAR mechanisms and  Greater DMC ownership:    Concerned institutions\u2019 \nperformance in each  Main executing agencies endorse  PPR   commitment to effective LAR \n \nDMC improved   standard resettlement plan  and rapid project \nTA monitoring \nformats, entitlements frameworks,  implementation \nsystem   \nand LAR implementation schemes   \nAttention of concerned \nacceptable to ADB; resettlement  Project external \ninstitutions to quality at entry \nplans are properly and timely  monitoring reports \nand project delivery. \ndisclosed to the affected people   \nby mid-2013  Attention to project \n \nimplementation \nGreater LAR capacity:  \n \nExecuting agencies regularly \n \nsupervise LAR preparation and \nimplementation in the field, \nprovide inputs to consultants, and \nreview draft resettlement plans \nbefore they are sent for approval \nto ADB by mid-2013 \n \nFewer disbursement delays: \nAt least 20% of projects finalize \nLAR plans in parallel with detailed \ndesign, and fully compensate \naffected people within 6 months, \nby mid- 2013 \n \nBetter complaints resolution \nmechanisms.

It will involve the team leader (and needed international \nspecialists) and national specialist only until phase 2 is finished. After that, the \ntasks will be continued by the national specialist alone until the last month of the \nTA when the team leader will carry out a 0.5 person-month mission for each \ncountry  to  evaluate  the  TA  with  the  national  specialist.  If  phase  1  is  not \ncompleted  within  the  planned  period,  phase  3  will  continue  to  pursue  the \nconclusion of phase 1 tasks so as to start phase 2 tasks.  \n \n4.
