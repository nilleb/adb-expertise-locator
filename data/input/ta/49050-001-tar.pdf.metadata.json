INTRODUCTION \n1.  Major  cities  in  Pakistan  have  experienced  rapid  urbanization  since  1951,  with  an \naverage  urban  population  growth  of  4%  per  year.  By  2030,  about  60%  of  the  country\u2019s \npopulation will be living in urban areas, of which 12 large cities will have a population of more \nthan 1 million inhabitants. While economic activities in urban areas produce more than 75% of \nnational income (gross domestic product), about 15% of the urban population lives in poverty. \nUrban infrastructure is aging and services are not adequate for enabling cities\u2019 potential for \neconomic development and creation of jobs.  \n \n2.  Against  this  backdrop,  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2015\u201320191for  Pakistan \nstates  that  ADB  will  support  the  government\u2019s  priorities  for  urban  renewal  with  improved \ninfrastructure and institutions for water supply, sanitation, and other critical areas at national, \nprovincial, and city-level. The country partnership strategy and country operations business \nplan, 2016\u201320182 also underscore the importance of greater equity, facilitation of inclusive jobs, \nand increased economic opportunities by supporting reforms that improve urban services and \nsupport  the  achievement  of  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  The  proposed  technical \nassistance (TA) is included in the country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018.  \n \n3.  Under the proposed TA, ADB and the Government of Pakistan have agreed to focus on \nthe  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  province,  primarily  because  of  the  province\u2019s  strong  political \ncommitment. The government concurred with the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, geographic \nfocus, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference \nduring ADB missions fielded in March and July 2016.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  province  is  strategically  located  at  the  cross  road  for \nAfghanistan and Central Asia. The total population of the province at the time of the 1998 \npopulation  census  (last  population  census  in  Pakistan)  was  18  million.  As  of  2015,  it  is \nestimated that this population has reached over 30 million. There are two major agglomerations \nin the province: Greater Peshawar Region and Greater Abbottabad Region with a combined \npopulation  accounting  for  50%  of  the  provincial  population. 4  Citizens  in  urban  Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa, particularly the poor and women, are faced with a number of challenges including \naccess to land and housing, under serviced areas, employment opportunities, risk to climate \nchange and natural disasters, and pollution. Key underlying issues include: \n(i)  Poor governance systems. Overlapping organizational mandates and unclear \ndivision  of  responsibilities  among  different  government  agencies  need  to  be \nfurther streamlined.  Resource allocation for urban sector infrastructure could be \noptimized when clearer mandates and roles are established among the different \nlocal government bodies.    \n(ii)  Weak  capacities.  The  government  capacity  is  limited  for  strategic  decision \nmaking in the urban sector. A comprehensive capacity development plan and \nhuman resource strategy  are  needed  in  order to  plan  and  implement  urban \nsector projects and meet the constantly evolving challenges in the urban sector.   \n(iii)  Lack of data. Key data required for effective urban sector planning is lacking. \nThe government requires reliable and updated data for strategic decision making \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2015. Country Partnership Strategy: Pakistan, 2015\u20132019. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Pakistan, 2016\u20132018. Manila. \n3  Fact-finding mission was fielded on 1\u20137 March 2016, consultation mission was fielded on 18\u201329 July 2016. The TA \nfirst appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 September 2016. \n4  The data is based on analysis by the Urbanization Research Program in Pakistan.  \n ", "2 \nin the urban sector. Under this TA, once data collection methodologies are tested \nand baselines are established, the government will be in a position to monitor \nchanges in the urban sector. These data includes key socio-economic indicators \nsuch as urban populations and growth rates.   \n(iv)  Vulnerability  to  disasters.  Increasing  vulnerability  to  disasters  and  climate \nchange, including because of rapid and unplanned urbanization, puts additional \npressure  on  the  government\u2019s  limited  capacity.  The  government  needs  to \nundertake a comprehensive approach on mitigation and adaptation measures. \n \n5.  These issues have been exacerbated by: (i) a lack of urban data including lack of  \ncurrent demographic data which is the basis for designing data sets; (ii) a commensurate delay \nin revising the delineation of urban areas; (iii) the changing urban composition and morphology \ndue to internal and external migration; (iv) frequent disasters triggered by natural hazards;        \n(v) instability due to conflict and security; (vi) delays in local government elections (after a gap of \nnearly  a  decade,  the  most  recent  were  held  in  2015);  and  (vii)  systemically  poor  gender \nindicators. \n \n6.  Under the 18th Amendment to the Constitution passed in 2010, urban functions have \nbeen fully delegated to the provincial governments as one of their major responsibilities. The \ngovernment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa realized the importance of the urban sector in economic \ndevelopment and the new opportunities brought about by investments in transport corridors \nincluding  the  China  Pakistan  Economic  Corridor  and  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation Corridor 5 and 6. The province\u2019s growth strategy sets urban development as a \nmajor pillar for economic growth, enabling a broader discourse and interest in the urban sector \nand its role, particularly of the two major agglomerations, in the overall development strategy for \nthe province.5 The new political party and government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are keen to \ndemonstrate improved governance and services.  \n \n7.  The proposed TA will assist the government in adopting an integrated urban sector \ndevelopment approach that entails policy reforms, investments, and capacity building in the \nurban sector. The TA will support the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government in five main areas:       \n(i) identifying cities potential to contribute to the economic development; (ii) developing a road \nmap for sustainable urban development; (iii) preparing regional development plans (RDPs);     \n(iv) developing capacity implementing agencies; and (v) mainstreaming lessons in the urban \nsector. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  impact  is  aligned  with  renewed  focus  on  inclusive  and  sustainable  urban \ndevelopment  in  provincial  policies  and  allocations.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  urban \ninclusivity, sustainability, and resilience in investment programming in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. \n \n                                                \n5  International Growth Centre. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Economic Strategy Report. http://www.theigc.org/project/khyber-\npukhtunkhwa-economic-strategy-report/ \n ", "3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA outputs include: (i) sector road map for inclusive and sustainable urban growth \nendorsed; (ii) RDPs prepared by provincial and local governments;6 (iii) institutional capacity for \nimplementation agencies built; and (iv) lessons from pilots on accredited trainings and municipal \nbusiness planning mainstreamed within the urban sector. The outputs will be implemented \nthrough  a  participatory  process  to  ensure  stakeholder  consultations  across  the  political \nspectrum and all income levels.  \n \n10.  Four themes run across all TA outputs: poverty alleviation, gender inclusivity, enabling \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises, and building resilience to disasters and climate change.7 \nGender mainstreaming will be ensured, in addition to disaggregation of data, through gender \nassessments  undertaken  as  part  of  the  sector  road  map  and  regional  analysis. \nRecommendations will be made for gender inclusiveness in the sector road map, RDPs, and \ninvestment planning; increasing gender staffing in the urban sector; and providing training. A \nknowledge product will be produced on mainstreaming gender in the urban sector.   \n \n11.  One of the government\u2019s primary concerns about undertaking development work in the \nprovince is a lack of population data. According to current estimates, the population of Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa has increased by nearly 70% since the last official census. One of the first \nactivities under the TA will be an analysis on population and demographics,8 which will enable \ndelineation of urban areas and of the two regional agglomerations of Greater Peshawar Region \nand Greater Abbottabad, and propose new estimates for the urban population and describe its \nsettlement pattern. \n \n12.  The sector road map also aims to build a case for increasing investments and improving \nservices in urban areas. To do this, the road map will: (i) analyze public expenditure and \ninfrastructure deficit; (ii) formulate a strategy for emerging economic opportunities based on the \ncomparative  advantage  of  urban  centers;  (iii)  prioritize  key  institutional  and  organizational \nchallenges; (iv) recommend a skills and competency strategy (learning from the pilot on training \naccreditation from established institutions); (v) present a plan for climate change and disaster \nrisk mitigation and adaptation for the key urban centers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; and (vi) identify \nthe list of success factors for better performance of urban sector operation. In addition to \ncovering the above six issues, the sector roadmap will also recommend how an integrated \nurban sector development could be best adopted in this local context. Infrastructure investment \nalone cannot result in improved services, unless capacities, resources, and systems are in \nplace to deliver services sustainably \u2014future project designs will need to ensure that all project \nstakeholders share this view and are committed to it. \n \n13.  In parallel to the road map, the TA will prepare RDPs that provide a broad land use plan \nand include prioritized investments for the two regions, taking into account the comparative \nadvantages of major cities and their vulnerabilities to natural hazards and climate change. The \nTA will build synergy and coordinate with ongoing initiatives on multi hazard vulnerability and \nrisks, including those under ADB\u2019s proposed National Disaster Risk Management Fund Project, \nand  with  the  Ministry  of  Climate  Change.  To  establish  the  groundwork  for  smoother \n                                                \n6  The regional development plans will be further complemented by  city development plans, climate risk and \nvulnerability assessments, and project prefeasibility through parallel financing of $1.20 million from the Cities \nDevelopment Initiative for Asia and the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund.  \n7  ADB. 2015. Country Partnership Strategy: Pakistan, 2015\u20132019. Manila. \n8  This will be undertaken as a sub-activity under the sector road map and RDP. \n ", "4 \nimplementation of ensuing urban investments, the TA will work with key project implementing \nagencies to strengthen their institutional mandate and enhance their organizational efficacy.  \n \n14.  In order to improve urban project readiness, the TA includes two pilots: (i) a skills-\nenhancement pilot for an accreditation system; and (ii) reforms for improving municipal business \nplanning. Several interventions have been undertaken in the past to build staff capacity in the \nurban sector, but limited work has been done on instituting an accreditation training system or \nenhancing business planning in municipalities. The skill-enhancement pilot builds on the road \nmap\u2019s analysis of skills, competencies, and organizational and institutional challenges at the \nprovincial, regional, and city levels. The second pilot aims to test the scope for improving the \nmunicipal business planning process, particularly the revenue stream. Under this pilot, a city\u2019s \nbusiness plan will be assessed in detail, the scope for improving the revenue stream will be \nidentified and tested, and lessons learned from this process will be documented. In addition, \nrecommendations on policy and procedural changes in rates, fees, and tariffs will be made, and \nstaff will be trained on regulating and reviewing tariff, tax, and fee increases. \n \n15.  Risks under the TA primarily stem from the fact that  the institutional structures for \nregional and city-level planning are weak, which may affect the quality, viability, and pace of \nurban investment. Moreover, with general elections planned for 2018, the elected government\u2019s \npriorities may change during implementation due to political pressures. To address this: (i) wide-\nscale  consultations  are  being  conducted  with  a  range  of  stakeholders,  including  different \npolitical parties; (ii) a provincial steering committee and two working groups have been notified \nby the provincial government to facilitate coordination at the provincial and regional levels; and \n(iii) a road map for building competency in the public sector, pilots, and accreditation training is \nincluded in the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.40 million, of which $2.00 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB, and $0.40 \nmillion will be financed by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). In parallel, \nthe Cities Development Initiative for Asia and the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund \nhave  allocated  parallel  financing  of  $1.2  million.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, office space, space for workshops, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The value of the government\u2019s contribution is estimated to account for 2% of the \ntotal TA cost.9 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be administered by ADB, with its Urban Development and Water Division of \nthe Central and West Asia Department as the focal point. The executing agency will be the \ngovernment\u2019s Planning and Development Department (PDD). The implementing agencies will \ninclude the PDD\u2019s Urban Policy Unit, the PDD\u2019s Economic Section, and the Local Government, \nElections and Rural Development.10 The TA funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA \nwill be monitored closely through regular missions by ADB\u2019s Urban Development and Water \nDivision and Pakistan Resident Mission, quarterly reports from consultants, and regular follow-\n                                                \n9  ADB will administer cofinancing from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction under a joint financing arrangement. \n10 The Local Government, Elections and Rural Development Department is the line department for administrative \nreporting by district governments and tehsil municipal administrations. \n ", "5 \nups by the executing agency. TA effectiveness is targeted on December 2016 and will be \nimplemented over a 2-year period.   \n \n18.  ADB  will  engage  consultants  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The draft terms of reference for consultants \nare in Appendix 3. Detailed terms of reference with defined outputs and budgets will be made \navailable upon request. Four types of recruitment will be undertaken. \n(i)  One consulting firm will be recruited using quality- and cost-based selection \n(90:10) and will be required to submit a full technical proposal. The package will \ninclude  (a)  a  sector  road  map,  (b)  RDPs,  and  (c)  training  and  knowledge \nproducts from output 4. \n(ii)  United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) Pakistan will be \nhired using single-source selection method through a lump-sum, output-based \ncontract to pilot the municipal business plan, a component of output 4. This is \nbecause the pilot is a natural extension of UN-Habitat\u2019s previous work. Moreover, \nthe presence of UN-Habitat established in the country will help to mitigate the \ndisruptions to TA, as it is more likely for UN-Habitat to continue its services than \na private firm in case of security events in the pilot city.  \n(iii)  Four resource persons from a technical institute in Japan will be financed to help \nbuild capacity on geographic information systems (a component of output 4). \nCurrent discussions are ongoing with the Center for Spatial Information Science \nat the University of Tokyo. Travel, accommodation, and per diem will be paid for \nthe resource persons, in keeping with ADB rules. \n(iv)  Four individual national consultants will be hired for output 3. \n \n19.  A TA steering committee established for oversight, coordination, and guidance is chaired \nby the PDD additional chief secretary, and comprises members from relevant departments, the \nprivate  sector,  and  local  governments.  Regional  working  groups  chaired  by  the  relevant \ncommissioners  have  also  been  established  for  the  two  urban  agglomerations.11 For  every \nmilestone, formal consultative workshops with a range of stakeholders will be organized to \nensure feedback and seek recommendations. Three knowledge products produced under the \nTA on lessons learned and good practices will be presented by the Urban Policy Unit at the \nannual National Urban Forum held in Pakistan. The PDD\u2019s Urban Policy Unit will include the TA \nactivities and outputs on its current website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and (ii) ADB providing the \nbalance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis, to the Islamic Republic of \nPakistan for the Provincial Strategy for Inclusive and Sustainable Urban Growth, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n11  Steering committee and regional working groups for Peshawar and Abbottabad were notified on 5 September 2016 \nas per Notification No. C/FA/P&D/ADB/2016. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nRenewed focus on inclusive and sustainable urban development in provincial policies and allocationsa \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nImproved urban  GOKP endorsed investments for  Annual development  Conflict and \ninclusivity,  urban areas increased by Q1 2019  plans and local  security risks \nsustainability, and  (2017 baseline: to be established)1  government budgets in  limit provincial \nresilience in    Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  and local \ninvestment      governments' \nprogramming in  ability to apply \nKhyber  tools \nPakhtunkhwa \nOutputs       \n1.

Sector road map for inclusive and sustainable urban growth. Recommendations for \nimproving the performance of the urban sector will be made. Six background papers will be \nprepared on the following: \n(i)  Population  and  demographic  analysis.  Using  triangulation-based \nmethodologies, this paper will analyze population and demographic settlement \npatterns in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Using the 1998 census as the base year, the \npaper will use satellite imagery, luminosity images, secondary data sets, and \nqualitative and quantitative surveys and analysis to (a) present a considered \ncase for the estimated and projected urban population, as well as its morphology \nand settlement patterns; (b) delineate agglomerations and cities; and (c) highlight \nkey demographic characteristics. This information will also be useful for other \nsectors. This paper will advocate increasing investments in urban areas, based \non population projections. \n(ii)  Public  expenditure  review  and  infrastructure  deficit.  This  paper  will \nundertake a 20-year review of major urban investments in the province to (a) \nprepare a baseline, (b) identify trends based on secondary sources, (c) compile \ninformation on service coverage from secondary sources, (d) undertake spot \nsurveys  and  focus  groups  for  corroboration,  and  (e)  identify  household  and \ncommunity investments. This will provide an estimate of the current infrastructure \nand service deficit. The paper will present different scenarios correlating the \ninfrastructure deficit to improvements in service coverage over a 10\u201315-year \nperiod. \n(iii)  Strategy for emerging economic opportunities based on the comparative \nadvantage of urban centers. This paper will (a) estimate the current economic \npotential  of  urban  areas  and  their  contribution  to  the  provincial  economy, \n(b) identify key subsectors with a comparative advantage at the agglomeration \nand city levels, and (c) prioritize urban subsectors based on the multiplier effect \non the economy. This will be undertaken through secondary data analysis, and \nqualitative and quantitative surveys. Based on the economic case, this paper will \nmake recommendations as to the principles and criteria to be used for provincial \nallocations, and projections as to (a) the estimated impact of investment on \nsocioeconomic  growth,  (b)  the  multiplier  effect  of  investments,  and  (c)  the \npotential for greater participation of small and medium-sized enterprises. It will \nalso advocate increasing investments in urban areas, improving governance in \nurban areas, and prioritizing the urban sector to pave the way for the proposed \nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa Intermediate Cities Investment Program. \n(iv)  Institutional and organizational reforms for the urban sector. This paper will \ndescribe  urban  institutional  arrangements  and  organizations for the following \nurban functions: policy, regulation, sector planning, municipal delivery, and utility. \nSpecial attention will be given to cross cutting themes i.e. poverty alleviation, \ngender inclusivity, enabling small and medium-sized enterprises, and building \nresilience to disasters and climate change. The assessment will examine key \nareas of weakness and provide a business plan (including implementation costs) \nfor future investments including the proposed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Intermediate \nCities Investment Program. \n ", "Appendix 3  11 \n(v)  Skills and competency assessment and strategy. This paper will be based on \na provincial survey of current skills and competencies of public employees in the \nurban sector, the ambit and purpose of different service cadres (provincial, local, \nand  relevant  federal  governments),  and  will  qualitatively  assess  supply-side \nactors, such as contractors. The analysis will gender-disaggregate across roles \nand cadres, facilitating a structured discussion of a long-term plan to build the \ncapacity of mid-level professionals for urban management and services while \nprioritizing women\u2019s participation. The long-term goal is to build a case for an \nurban service cadre. \n(vi)  Climate change and disaster risk mitigation and adaptation for the urban \nsector. This paper will use secondary data on climate change and disaster risk in \nKhyber  Pakhtunkhwa  and  qualitative  data  collected  as  part  of  the  regional \nplanning and city planning exercise (outputs 2 and 3) to present the risks posed \nby  climate  change  and  natural  hazards  to  people,  economic  activities,  and \ninfrastructure. It will also present key mitigation and adaptation measures for the \ntwo major agglomerations. \n \n2.  Knowledge products. Three knowledge products that document the innovative aspects \nof this technical assistance (TA), particularly gender mainstreaming and urban climate change \nresilience, will be presented at the annual national conference on the urban sector. The tasks \nunder this package include (i) the collation of secondary data; (ii) a survey and data analysis, \nincluding  income  and  gender  disaggregation;  (iii)  discussions  and  presentations  of  the  six \nbackground  papers;  (iv)  recommendations  for  the  provincial  government  on  increasing \nallocation efficiency; and (v) recommendations for reforms, including urban climate change \nresilience and gender mainstreaming in the sector under the ensuing loan. The consultation and \nparticipation of stakeholders will be an integral part of building ownership of the findings and the \ncapacity to understand their implications for the urban sector. Themes covered in the papers will \ninclude poverty, gender, inequality, and the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises. \nDuring the execution of the package, the consultant\u2019s team, particularly the team leader, will \nensure that policy makers in provincial and local governments are involved in the discussions, \nand made aware of the findings and implications for resource allocation. Formal presentations \nwill be held with representatives of the provincial and local governments. \n \n3.  Two  regional  development  plans  (RDPs)  for  Greater  Peshawar  and  Greater \nAbbottabad. The regional development plans aim to provide a strategic multi sector plan that \nidentifies the comparative advantages of a particular region and a 10\u201315-year investment plan \nfor the cities. The RDPs will prioritize key subsectors, including tourism and cultural heritage, \nshelter and internally displaced persons, commodity markets and logistics, climate change and \ndisaster risk management, municipal services, and regional connectivity. The RDPs may also \nexplore interventions that will benefit from economies of scale or interconnectivity. The RDPs \nmay prioritize crosscutting areas such as corporate or business planning, data and indicators, \nhuman resources, procurement, safeguards, and anticorruption. Special attention will be paid to \nthe urban poor, women\u2019s participation, and measures to address income and gender inequity. \nThe RDPs will be responsible for assessing spatial and demographic land use, and identifying \ninvestments for urban areas within the region. The 10\u201315-year investment plans at the regional \nlevel will help identify the appropriate loan modality and the nature of investments under the \nloan. \n \n4.  Accreditation  training  pilot.  This  will  help  identify  the  capacity-building  gaps  for \nensuing urban investments across the province including the proposed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa \nIntermediate Cities Investment Program, improve project preparedness, and test the scope for \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \nreforms.  The  pilot  will  (i)  identify  key  training  gaps  based  on  the  skills  and  competency \nassessments undertaken as part of the sector road map, (ii) enter into a memorandum of \nunderstanding with an established institution or recognized university, (iii) conduct the training, \nand (iv) examine and certify participants through an accredited institution. \n \n5.
