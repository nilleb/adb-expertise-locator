The  draft  country  strategy  and  program  update  (CSPU)  2004\u20132006  for  Vanuatu \nidentifies three main areas the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) assistance will focus on: (i) \ndevelopment of a government and bureaucracy that operate in a transparent, accountable, and \nfully accessible manner; (ii) provision of services to the poor, particularly to address problems of \nunemployment and lack of training in the outer islands; and (iii) creation of an environment \nconducive for private sector development, including reducing costs, encouraging competition, \ncreating a secure framework for transactions, and expanding business development finance. \nAccess to credit, particularly in rural areas, is widely acknowledged as a major impediment \nparticularly for the development of ingenious micro and small enterprise. As a consequence, \nADB provided in 2002 project preparatory technical assistance1 to the National Bank of Vanuatu \n(NBV) to design a rural finance product for pilot testing in rural areas. The draft country strategy \nprogram  update  states  \u201dif  so  requested,  and  after  more  experience  is  gotten  under  the \nmicrofinance pilot project [implemented by NBV], ADB would help develop a proposal for a \nsuitable microfinance program.\u201d NBV\u2019s recent evaluation (July 2003) of the pilot project showed \nvery encouraging results. Subsequently, the Government requested ADB to provide an advisory \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  carry  out  a  detailed  analysis  of  ongoing,  predominantly \ngovernment-run credit schemes; develop a strategy to consolidate these schemes; and provide \ncapacity-building support for the expansion of the rural and mircofinance services.  \n \n2.  The ADB Fact-Finding Mission (the Mission) visited Vanuatu during 29 September\u20133 \nOctober 2003.2 The Mission consulted with representatives from Government agencies, the \nprivate sector, commercial banks, and external funding agencies. The TA paper is based on the \nMission\u2019s analysis of the rural financial market and the views expressed by the stakeholders \nduring the Mission. The TA Framework is in Appendix 1 and the Summary Initial Social and \nPoverty Analysis is in Appendix 2. The Government reconfirmed its strong interest in and \nsupport for the TA, and highlighted its timeliness.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  According to the population census of 1999, Vanuatu had 146,584 people in 28,157 \nhouseholds in rural areas. About 78% of rural households are in the outer islands. Agricultural \nproduction is the main source of income for rural households and accounts for about 25% of the \ngross domestic product. Most of the rural people are on low-income categories. According to the \nhousehold income and expenditure survey of 1998, 52% of the rural households had monthly \nincomes of less than Vt20,000 ($174). Despite the heavy concentration of population in rural \nareas, rural financial services remain underdeveloped. Although many rural households have \nsavings accounts with NBV, most do not have access to credit from semi-formal or formal \nfinancial  institutions,  including  NBV.4  Urban  low-income  groups  also  suffer  from  the  same \nproblem. However, recent reviews of community priorities undertaken by the Rural Economic \nDevelopment  Initiatives  Program,5  as  well  as  other  community  assessments,  and  the \nparticipatory poverty assessment, all point to a common need for improved financial services.  \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Vanuatu for Rural Financial Services. Manila (approved on 16 \nJune 1999 for $250,000, and completed on 31 May 2002). \n2 The Mission comprised Andrea Iffland, senior country programs specialist/mission leader, and Nimal Fernando, lead \nmicrofinance specialist.   \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 3 September 2003. \n4  For example, NBV had only 790 active loans at the end of 2002. \n5 The program is an initiative of the Department of Provincial Affairs. It emphasizes the economic needs of rural \ncommunities, which are identified by the communities themselves. The resulting proposals for improving their \nsource of livelihood are submitted for Government assistance.    ", "2  \n4.  Vanuatu underwent a comprehensive reform program in the late 1990s. Under this \nprogram, the financial sector experienced significant institutional changes. The Development \nBank of Vanuatu was closed; NBV was restructured; additional capital was injected; and NBV \nwas placed under new, foreign management. These reforms however, did not provide a solution \nto the problem of the rural population's lack of access to financial services. Nor did it address \nthe financing problem of urban low-income households.  \n \n5.  The Government has, in recent years, attempted to increase the supply of credit to rural \nand urban low-income people through various measures. Most of the measures depend on \ngrants  provided  by  external  funding  agencies.  Two  rural  sector-focused  programs,  the  Ni-\nVanuatu Small Business Development Fund (NVSBDF) and the Co-operative Development \nFund (CDF), are financed with a grant provided by the People's Republic of China.6  The \nNVSBDF is operated by the Department of Trade while the Department of Co-operatives and \nRural Business Development Services operates the CDF program. The NVSBDF has provided \nloans to individuals and the CDF lends to cooperatives for purposes such as procurement of \ncopra  from  their  members  and  vehicles  for  transport  of  produce.  The  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme  (UNDP)  funded  the  Vanuatu  Women  Development  Scheme \n(VANWODS),  a  modified  Grameen  Bank  replication  targeted  at  urban  low-income, \ndisadvantaged women.7 The European Union has agreed to provide a credit line of E160,000 \nfor agricultural producers, and a credit line of approximately $100,000 for the members of the \nTourism Bungalow Association. The Chamber of Commerce will operate both schemes. In \nDecember 2002, NBV introduced a rural finance loan on a pilot basis in the outer island of \nTanna. This loan product was developed with the support from an ADB-funded TA (footnote 1). \nThis is the only rural credit facility operated by a financial institution. \n \n6.  The sporadic attempts by some government departments to address the demand-supply \ngap in rural credit, although with a good intentions, appear to have aggravated the problem. \nFirst, they have contributed to the fragmentation of the market rather than integration. Second, \nthey  have  promoted  financial  indiscipline  through  lax  approaches  to  loan  screening  and \nrecovery. Except VANWODS, credit programs operated by government departments have very \nlow loan recovery rates that severely limit their outreach and rapidly deplete their capital. Third, \nthey have led to a substantial wastage of scarce resources. Fourth, they have also created a \nnew group of stakeholders that opposes reforms in rural financial markets aimed to improve \noutreach on a sustainable basis. The latter was evident to the Mission by the refusal of some \nkey officials to provide necessary data and information on operations of the NVSBDF and CDF. \nThe Government is aware of this unsatisfactory situation and the reluctance of departments that \nmanage the NVSBDF and CDF to release the remaining funds. However, the Government \ncontinues to stress the importance of providing access to finance for rural households and small \nbusinesses, and has therefore given the highest priority to the consolidation of the government-\noperated schemes.   \n \n7.  The poor performance of credit schemes operated by government departments has \ncreated a great deal of disappointment among the rural population, operators of micro and small \nenterprises and politicians, and rekindled interest in establishing a new financial institution to \nprovide rural financial services. Among people who propose a new financial institution, some \n                                                 \n6  The Mission was advised by Embasy of the People\u2019 Republic of China that (i) the grant is to be used to support \nrural and small businesses; (ii) no implementing arrangements were specified; and (iii) and no performance reports \nare required.  \n7  VANWODS  is  undergoing  some  changes  in  management  and  operations  with  renewed  support  from  the \nGovernment and UNDP. Major stakeholders at a high-level meeting held in Port Vila on 4 February 2003 have \nendorsed a strategy for transforming of VANWODS into a commercially oriented institution. The Government  is \npursuing this strategy with assistance from UNDP, as the services are oriented to disadvantaged groups.  ", "  3\nsupport  the  need  to  consolidate  the  numerous  existing  credit  schemes  or  programs  of \nnonfinancial institutions. Some others simply base their support on the need for a new institution \nto meet the demand for development finance. The first category appears to support the creation \nof a financial subsidiary of NBV while the second category argues for a new development bank \ndespite the checkered history and closure of the development bank that the country had until \nthe late 1990s. \n \n8.  Given the small size of the market, the scattered population in outer islands, and low \npopulation density, there is no justifiable case for either of these models for rural financial \nmarket  development.  First,  the  consolidation  of  existing  schemes/programs  does  not \nnecessarily require a new institution and there are more effective and efficient ways to achieve \nthis objective. Second, limited human resources in the financial sector are a binding constraint \non a new institution. Third, a new institution also requires a network of outlets to reach rural \nareas. A superstructure alone cannot ensure sustainable outreach. Fourth, a new institution \nmay be compelled to charge prohibitively high interest rates to cover costs and build its equity \nbase over time. The effective demand for credit at such rates may not be as high as it is \ngenerally presumed to be. Fifth, an institution providing only loans cannot perform the much \nneeded financial intermediation services and capture economies of scale. Given this situation, \nNBV\u2019s branch network and infrastructure may be more efficiently and effectively used at a lower \nmarginal cost to expand the outreach on a sustainable basis. NBV has a significant outreach in \nouter islands on the savings side and achieved generally successful results with the new rural \nloan product launched on a pilot basis. However, the Government needs to continue its policy of \nnoninterference with NBV's business operations. If political interference is allowed even on a \nsmallscale, NBV will not be able to adopt a commercial approach. \n \n9.  Thus, analysis of the issues and options has lead the Government to allow NBV to play \nthe lead role in expanding rural financial service outreach. This could be done (i) through  \ntransferring the responsibility for administration of the existing schemes to NBV on a fee basis, \nand (ii) with continued support for NBV to expand the successfully pilot-tested rural credit \nproduct to all of its branches. At the same time, NBV has to be proactive in expanding its \ndeposit mobilization activities in rural areas, given that many rural households value easy \naccess to safe and convenient deposit services. Such services are particularly important for  \npoor households. \n \n10.  NBV's new rural loan product, introduced on a pilot basis, offers considerable promise. \nNBV had given 49 loans under this pilot scheme in its Tanna branch and 20 in its Efate branch \nby the end of September 2003. The recovery rate was 100% at the end of September 2003. \nHowever,  NBV is excessively risk averse due to its history of high nonperforming loans.  \n \n11.  Given the small size of the market, there is no room for another formal institution like \nNBV to operate in rural areas. However, NBV has to adopt a dynamic business approach and \nuse its infrastructure to reach as many rural households as possible without compromising the \nquality of its loan portfolio. NBV needs to (i) take appropriate measures to offer the new rural \nloan product on an increasing scale in all branches, (ii) make a systematic effort to offer more \ndemand-driven deposit services to increase the deposit outreach in rural areas and among low-\nincome households in urban areas, and (iii) explore possibilities for introducing a cash-flow-\nbased rural loan product.  \n ", "4  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The TA will assist the Government to provide people in urban and rural areas with \naccess  to  financial  services  and  subsequently  enable  people  to  pursue  viable  economic \nopportunities and income-generating activities. The expected outcomes that will contribute to \nachieving the goal are that (i) existing and future rural and microfinance services follow a \nconsistent approach that ensures sustainable, effective, and efficient service delivery; and (ii) \npeople in rural and urban areas take advantage of the availability of sustainable rural and \nmicrofinance services. The associated outputs are (i) the consolidation of existing Government-\noperated rural and small business financing schemes, and (ii) the expansion of rural financial \nservices provided by NBV. The TA will assist NBV to design a performance-based service \nagreement to use the resources in directed credit programs operated by the Government to \nprovide credit for economic activities of rural households and low-income households in urban \nareas on a commercial basis. The design of a banking education campaign and a savings \nmobilization strategy will address a key issue in financial intermediation, so far neglected in \nVanuatu. The scope of the TA includes assistance to NBV to (i) design a sustainable cash flow-\nbased  loan  product,  (ii)  develop  performance  indicators  and  a  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem, (iii) assess the performance of NBV\u2019s rural finance loan product and the direct and \nindirect costs associated with it; and (iv) train loan officers in credit appraisal. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Output  1.  A  guided  study  tour  to  selected  microfinance  institutions  in  Asia  will  be \norganized in preparation of the expansion of sustainable rural and microfinance in Vanuatu. \nParticipants will include senior officials from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management \n(MFEM), the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu, NBV management, and the Chamber of Commerce. \nEach participant will present the knowledge and insights gained during the study tour at a \nnational stakeholder workshop in Vanuatu. The international consultant will present the guiding \nprinciples of rural microfinance at this workshop. A better and shared understanding of the \nbasics of rural microfinance and a draft action plan to expand it will be the output of the \nworkshop.   \n \n14.  NBV will be assisted by the international consultant in drafting a performance-based \nservice agreement that will guide the operations of the consolidated credit funds on behalf of the \nMFEM. Lending modalities and procedures applicable for a cash flow-based loan product to be \nfinanced from the consolidated funds will be determined. Performance indicators will be agreed \nupon and features of the associated monitoring and evaluation system will de determined. It is \nexpected that the performance agreement will be used as a framework for future credit facilities \nprovided by the Government and external agencies. The underlying assumption is that the \nGovernment and external agencies will continue to support and adopt sound principles of rural \nmicrofinance and do not revert to subsidized loans and fund depleting credit schemes.  \n \n15.  Output 2. In preparation for extending the outreach of NBV\u2019s rural financial services, an \nin-depth evaluation of NBV\u2019s pilot-tested loan product will be carried out. The international \nconsultant will help NBV prepare an expansion plan to extend the rural loan product to other \nbraches in the outer islands, and carry out credit appraisal training for loan officers. NBV will be \nassisted  to  formulate  a  savings  mobilization  strategy  and  to  subsequently  implement  the \nstrategy. Options for expanding outreach in remote locations will be examined and legal and \nadministrative barriers to the mobilization of small savings will be addressed.  \n ", "  5\n16.   Based  on  available  information  and  the  experience  gained  in  Vanuatu  so  far, \nundoubtedly the market for rural financial services is underserved. Adequate product design will \nnarrow the demand-supply side gap and will subsequently stimulate the development of the \nprivate sector also in rural areas.  The results of the TA and the performance of rural and \nmicrofinance in Vanuatu will be documented and published in ADB\u2019s Pacific Studies Series.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $320,000 equivalent. The Government has requested that \nADB finance $250,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost of $200,000 and \n$50,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's \nTA funding program. The Government together with NBV will provide counterpart staff and in-\ncountry transportation for counterparts, local transport, office and communication facilities for \nthe international consultant, and workshop facilities amounting to $70,000 equivalent in local \ncurrency.  NBV  will  cover  the  costs  of  extending  the  rural  loan  product  to  additional  NBV \nbranches, including staff, office equipment, and operating costs. NBV\u2019s equity will be used to \nextend the rural finance loans. The TA will finance (i) international consulting services; (ii) one \nstudy  tour;  (iii)  training  and  workshops;  (iv)  savings  mobilization  and  a  banking  education \ncampaign; and (vi) equipment. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The Department of Economic and Social Development will be the Executing Agency of \nthe TA. The international consultant will work under the overall guidance of the Director General \nof MFEM. The managing director, the manager of lending operations, and the manager of risk \nmanagement of NBV will work on a day-to-day basis with the international consultant. The \ninternational consultant will advise the banking association of Vanuatu, currently chaired by \nNBV,  on  the  banking  education  campaign.  The  association  will  be  responsible  for  the \nimplementation.  \n \n19.  The international consultant will have specialization in financial sector development with \nan emphasis on rural financial services.  The TA will be implemented over a period of about 24 \nmonths (February 2004\u2013January 2006). The assignment of the consultant (3.5 person-months) \nwill be intermittent. The consultant will carry out a performance review of NBV\u2019s rural finance \nproduct, including an activity-based costing, assist NBV in preparing a first draft of the services \nagreement, and guide the study tour for senior government officials and NBV management. The \nconsultant  will  also  conduct  the  national  stakeholder  workshop  and  advise  NBV  on  the \nexpansion of rural financial services, including the design of a saving mobilization strategy, \nbanking  education  campaign,  and  associated  staff  training.  The  consultant  will  submit  (i) \nprogress reports after each field visit, summarizing findings, issues, and next steps; (ii) a draft \nfinal report, in accordance with the terms of reference, 2 weeks after the completion of the \nassignment; and (iii) a draft report suitable for publication. The expected TA completion date is \nJanuary 2006. An individual consultant will be selected and engaged by ADB in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Appendix 4 provides the outline terms of reference \nfor the consultant. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.
