INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  Bhutan  (the  Government)  has  requested  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to prepare the Road \nNetwork Project II.1 The technical assistance (TA) is included in the Country Operations and \nBusiness Plan 2008\u20132010, Bhutan.2 An ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Bhutan from 29 May \nto 3 June 2008 for the proposed TA, and reached agreement with the Government on the TA\u2019s \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference for consulting services. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  A large segment of the rural population of Bhutan has limited access to markets and \nmodern services because of the harsh geography and limited reach of the domestic transport \nsystem. There are no domestic flights, no railways, and no navigable rivers. Many areas are still \nnot served by roads, while the network of mule tracks is extensive. Most of the poor, especially \nin rural areas, feel that the Government should prioritize road infrastructure and bridges to \nimprove their living conditions.  \n3.  The oldest highway in Bhutan is the Phuentsholing\u2013Thimphu, which was constructed in \n1962.  The  national  road  network  in  the  country  has  since  expanded,  especially  with  the \nimprovement  and  widening  of  the  East\u2013West  national  highway  Thimphu\u2013Trashigang.3 The \ncountry\u2019s road network, as of June 2007, comprised 4,946.6 kilometers (km) of serviceable \nroads, including 1634.3 km of national highways, 481.2 km of district roads, 809.2 km of feeder \nroads, 150.6 km of urban roads, 716.9 km of farm roads, and 559.6 km of forest roads. The \nnumber of vehicles in Bhutan increased from 13,600 in 1997 to over 35,000 by early 2008, \nwhich represents an annual growth rate of over 15%.  Almost 90% of vehicles are in the western \nareas of Thimphu and Phuentsholing, over two thirds of all light vehicles are in the capital area, \nwhile 70% of all trucks are registered in Phuentsholing. The increase in the number of private \nvehicles in recent years has caused road safety concerns. The Government\u2019s Road Safety and \nTransport Authority reported 1,168 vehicle crashes and 49 fatalities in 2005, which increased \nfrom 230 crashes and 15 fatalities in 1999. The crash fatality rate in 2005 was 15.4 deaths per \n10,000 vehicles per year, which is considered significantly high.  \n4.  Despite the expansion of the road network, both connectivity and coverage remain \ninadequate,  especially  in  eastern  Bhutan  where  roads  only  reach  major  towns  and  most \nsettlements are hidden in the steep hillsides of remote and isolated valleys. The country is \ndependant on a single East\u2013West national highway running through the northern part of the \ncountry. The absence of a similar east-west highway running through the south has constrained \ntravel in the southern part of the country.  \n5.  The Government\u2019s strategy in road network development has been guided by the Road \nSector  Master  Plan  (2007\u20132027),  which  focuses  on  improving  access  and  connectivity \nthroughout the country. The 10th Five-Year Plan (2008\u20132013) prioritizes completion of the \nsouthern east\u2013west corridor, stretching from Sipsoo to Diafam (794 km), and consisting of \nupgrades to an existing 288 km of road and new construction of the remaining 506 km. \n                                                 \n1  The PPTA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 June 2008. \n2   ADB. 2007.

In addition, being a land-locked country, road access plays a vital part in trade and \ncommerce of Bhutan.  India is Bhutan's biggest trading partner accounting for some 90% of the \ncountry's imports and 70% of its exports.  Currently, there is only one north\u2013south road corridor, \nwhich connects Bhutan with India.  This is located in western Bhutan.  Bhutan's exports to \nBangladesh also travel via India.  In order to increase the trade flows, reduce costs, and provide \ngreater integration of national road network, it is necessary to improve additional north\u2013south \ntrading routes. \n \n7.  Along Bhutan\u2019s southern corridor, the western part has emerged as an economic growth \ncenter.  Improving  transport  connectivity  in  this  area  will  increase  the  potential  benefits  of \neconomic development. In the middle part of the southern corridor, the east\u2013west connection \ncan be established with minimal investment by utilizing the available north\u2013south connections. \nConnecting the eastern part of the southern corridor to the country\u2019s road network will promote \nsocioeconomic  development  and  reduce  extreme  poverty.  Improvement  connectivity  with \nexisting roads connecting India and Bangladesh will promote subregional economic cooperation. \nThe Government and ADB have agreed to focus the proposed TA\u2019s resources on a feasibility \nstudy for (i) a national highway in the eastern and western ends of the southern east\u2013west \ncorridor, and (ii) feeder roads in the middle part of the corridor. \n8.  Construction quality is a critical element for sustainable operation and management of \nthe proposed roads, and requires strengthening the capacity of both the Government and \nprivate  sector  in  quality  assurance  and  control.  The  Government  is  expected  to  provide \nadequate funds for road maintenance. In addition, the Department of Roads (DOR) may require \nreviewing-design standards, design quality, schedule of rate, and quality assurance systems to \nbe reflected in construction supervision and works contracts. The capacity of the private sector \nalso needs to be strengthened. The Government is considering a strategy of strengthening the \ncapacity of local contractors through, for example, more competition among regional contractors \nby increasing the size of contract packages. The proposed TA will reflect possible actions on the \nensuing  loan  such  as  enhancement  of  works  contracts  and  contract  packaging.  Another \nadvisory  technical  assistance  to  improve  construction  quality,  which  is  in  the  pipeline  for \napproval in 2009, will be reflected in the ensuing loan. The advisory technical assistance will be \nprocessed in a timely fashion and implemented in parallel with the proposed PPTA so that \nquality control systems will be in place for implementation of the ensuing loan. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  TA  will  impact  road  network  efficiency  in  the  southern  east\u2013west  corridor  and \nsubregional  connectivity,  contributing  to  expanded  economic  development  and  regionally-\nbalanced  development,  leading  to  poverty  reduction.  These  goals  will  be  achieved  by \nconnecting Manitar (Chhukha District) to Kerabari (Dagana District) and Samdrupcholing to \nDiafam (Sjonhar District), and constructing Tsebar-Mikuri-Shingchungri (Pemagatshel District) \nand Nimtola to Lhamoizingkha (Sarpang District) feeder roads.4 The outcome of the TA will be a \n                                                 \n4  Samdrupcholing \u2013 Diafam is part of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Road Corridor 5 \n(Samdrupcholing \u2013 Guwahati, India) identified by SAARC Regional Multimodal Transport Study that was endorsed \nby 14th SAARC Summit. While Nimtola \u2013 Lhamoizingkha is also connected to Barabisha in India. \n \n ", "3 \ncomprehensive study to inform project design for the ensuing loan. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The main deliverables of the TA include: (i) feasibility study, (ii) environmental study, (iii) \nsocial impact assessment, (iv) resettlement plans, (v) preliminary engineering design, and (vi) \nimplementation arrangement. The outline terms of reference for the consultants is in Appendix \n4. The roads selected for the feasibility study under the proposed TA will represent the most \nurgently-needed connections along the southern east\u2013west corridor, taking into consideration \nthe  importance  of  supporting  economic  activities,  serving  communities,  and  promoting \nsubregional economic cooperation.  \n11.

Surveys  on  road  conditions  and  traffic  will  be  carried  out  as \nrequired.  Future  traffic  levels  will  be  estimated  so  that  the  need  for  improvement  and/or \nupgrading can be determined and the associated costs estimated. Geological and topographical \nconditions will be taken into account when proposing improvements and upgrading. Following \nthe results of the economic analysis described below, preliminary design and implementation \narrangements will be proposed. Appropriate road safety principles will be incorporated in the \ndesign process in the early stages of the Project. \n13.  Economic  Analysis.  Based  on  traffic  projections,  required  construction  and \nimprovements, and an estimated maintenance program, an economic analysis will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects  (1997). \nIntervention options may need to be developed to test the optimum feasibility. In estimating the \neconomic internal rate of return, the benefit to the poor in the rural areas will be considered, \nincluding social benefits resulting from improved access to roads.  \n14.  Environmental Studies. The proposed Project, which involves construction of a new \nnational  road,  will  likely  be  categorized  as  an  \u201cA\u201d  project,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental Assessment Guidelines (2003).   In addition, the proposed Project will require \nenvironmental clearance from the National Environmental Commission (NEC). A full EIA report \nand summary will be prepared in accordance with the Government\u2019s related guidelines and \nprocedures, as well as ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and EIA guidelines. \n ", "4 \n15.  Social Studies.  Social analysis will be carried out according to ADB\u2019s Handbook on \nSocial Analysis (2007). If required, the project will prepare a resettlement and/or indigenous \npeoples framework or plans consistent with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $815,000  equivalent.  It  is  proposed  that \n$650,000  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan to support consultants, equipment, survey, and other implementation \ncosts. The Government will finance $165,000 equivalent through in-kind contributions. The \ndetailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  DOR will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA. A project manager will be appointed \nfor day-to-day supervision of the TA. The Government has assured ADB that all required \ncounterpart staff, office space, furniture, maps, reports, and other support services will be \nprovided to the consultants on the basis of availability. All equipment for the TA will be procured \naccording to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and turned \nover to DOR upon TA completion. \n18.  An  international  consulting  firm,  in  association  with  a  national  consulting  firm  or \nindividual national consultants, will be recruited to provide 17 person-months of international \nconsultancy and 14 person-months of national consultancy, with expertise in the areas of road, \nhighway, bridge, and geological engineering and road and transport economics. A national \nconsultant (4 person-months) will be recruited on an individual basis to carry out a social \nanalysis  and  resettlement  assessment.  In  addition,  one  international  consultant  (2  person-\nmonths) and one national consultant (4 person-months) will be recruited, each on an individual \nbasis, to carry out an environmental assessment of the proposed project. All consultants will be \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The consulting firm will be selected according to quality- and cost-\nbased selection procedures. \n19.  The TA\u2019s estimated starting date is November 2008 and the estimated closing date is \nJune  2009.  A  workshop,  which  will  include  all  relevant  central  agencies  and  dzongkhags \n(provinces), will be held to disseminate the output of the TA.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bhutan for preparing the Road Network Project II, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources and/or   \nDesign   Performance Targets and/or  Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nAn efficient road transport  Increased domestic and  Statistics and survey  Continued complementary \nsystem supporting enhanced  subregional cargo and  from Department of  external assistance, and \ndomestic and subregional  passenger transport    Roads (DOR), Road  Government\u2019s commitment to \nconnectivity in the southern  Safety and Transport  developing other economic \nReduced travel time \neast\u2013west corridor,  Authority (RSTA), and  infrastructure, and providing of \ncontributing to balanced  Reduced accident     provincial  basic social services. \neconomic development and  administrations   \nsubregional cooperation,       \nleading to poverty reduction.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy:  \nThe Bhutan National Poverty Reduction Strategy identifies remoteness and isolation as the major causes of poverty in \nBhutan and prioritizes the extension and improvement of physical infrastructure, inclusive communications, and \nplanned urbanization as strategic interventions to combat poverty.  The Bhutan Country Operations and Business Plan \n(2008\u20132010)a prioritizes ADB assistance to the transport sector to enhance the connectivity and accessibility of \nremote rural areas. \n \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General  Intervention     Individual  or  Household  (TI-H);  Geographic  (TI-G);  Non-Income  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nThe ensuing Project promotes economic development and poverty reduction in the southern east-west corridor \nthrough road linkages to economic hubs and administrative centers, as well as increased accessibility to and \nconnectivity of remote rural areas. \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed? N.A. \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence? \n \nConsultants\u2019 terms of reference will include brief surveys and analysis to determine the poverty impact and required \ninterventions (if any). \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nSome proposed road components are located in districts with a high poverty incidence. The Project will provide \nopportunities and benefits to poor people through employment as laborers. They will also benefit from nongovernment \norganization (NGO) training on health and safety issues, women and child trafficking, and HIV/AIDs programs. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the project?   \n \nRoad infrastructure improvement is critical to the economic development of the area.  Besides providing better \ntransport services, road infrastructure improvements will reduce travel time and transport costs. Improved roads will \nincrease the local population\u2019s access to health, education and other social services; and open new economic and \nemployment opportunities through linkages to new markets, production centers, and other economic opportunities.  \nThus, there is a strong link between transport and poverty reduction in the area. The direct beneficiaries are the road \nusers from the southern part of the country.  Benefits will also extend nationwide by lessening the burden of the \nnorthern east-west road network. \n \n \n ", "8  Appendix 2     \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nRoad accessibility; availability of electricity, health, and education facilities; and other services. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? \n \nNo constraints are envisaged at this stage. Efforts will be made to address those constraints if identified during the \nPPTA study. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n \nDzongkhag (provincial) administrative centers in the southern east\u2013west corridor (Chhukha, Dagana, Sarpang, \nSJongkhar, and Pemagatshel), nongovernment organizations involved with transport and environment sectors; other \ndevelopment partners active in transport sector; community groups; and road users and transport associations \n \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., \nworkshops,  community  mobilization,  involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based \norganizations, etc.)? \n \nWorkshops, involvement of NGOs and business support organizations, and community briefings \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.   \nC.  Gender and Development \n    1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program?  \nWomen and men will benefit equally from the Project through employment opportunities during construction and \nlower costs of transport after Project completion. The impact of an improved transport system upon women will be \nassessed at the PPTA stage. Efforts will be made to identify possible positive and negative impacts on women, and \nto provide indirect benefits or mitigating features (e.g., jobs for women in project construction work, information \ncampaigns on HIV/AIDS risks, and special resettlement assistance to households headed by women). \n2.    Does  the  proposed  project/program  have  the  potential  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or  women\u2019s \nempowerment by improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and \nparticipation in decision making?
