THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \n1.  The Tamil Nadu Urban Flagship Investment Program will develop priority water supply, \nsewerage, and drainage infrastructure in at least 10 cities located within strategic industrial \ncorridors of Tamil Nadu;1 support innovative pilot projects; improve urban governance; and \nstrengthen the capacity of state and local institutions to enhance environmental sustainability, \nclimate resilience, and urban livability.2 It will develop India's first solar-powered sewage treatment \nplant (STP) to offset greenhouse gas emissions and improve operational efficiency, providing \nstrong demonstration value. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n2.  Urban challenges in Tamil Nadu. The key urban sector issues in Tamil Nadu are:                  \n(i) acute infrastructure deficits and low service levels, with demand for both infrastructure and \nservices increasing as a result of rapid urbanization;3 (ii) water scarcity; (iii) environmental \npollution; (iii) weak capacity of urban local bodies (ULBs) to prepare and implement projects, and \nundertake operation and maintenance; (iv) inadequate tariff revisions for water and sewerage, \nwhich reduce available revenues and thereby reduce the effectiveness and sustainability of \nassets; and (v) mixed performance in key areas of governance, namely, financial management, \nrevenue generation, administration, and gender equality and social inclusion. The Government of \nTamil Nadu identified capacity building, mobilizing finance for urban infrastructure, accelerating \ninnovative approaches and green technologies, and advancing municipal reforms as keys to \nmodernizing cities and towns and making them more clean and livable.4 Accordingly, the state \nincreased its budget allocation for urban infrastructure to $1.98 billion equivalent (6.0% of the \ntotal), and for water supply and sanitation to $1.77 billion equivalent (5.4% of total budget) in its \nTwelfth Five-Year Plan (2012\u20132017).5  \n \n3.  Urban  institutional  framework.  The  Municipal  Administration  and  Water  Supply \nDepartment (MAWS) is the focal state-level department for urban development and responsible \nfor  urban  sector  activities  in  Tamil  Nadu,  except  urban  planning  and  housing.  The \nCommissionerate of Municipal Administration (CMA) under MAWS supports cities (other than \nChennai) to plan and implement urban infrastructure projects, and advances the urban reform \nagenda under the Constitution (Seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992 in key areas of planning, \ndevelopment, revenue generation, financial management, and service delivery. The ULBs and \ncity corporations are the local government entities mandated to provide basic urban services to \nits residents, with powers of taxation and revenue generation. \n \n                                                \n1  The project will include the following city and city municipal corporations, and municipalities (collectively referred to \nas cities): Ambur, Chennai, Coimbatore, Cuddalore, Rajapalayam, Thoothukudi, Tiruppur, Tiruchirappalli, Tirunelveli, \nand Vellore. Other cities are eligible for support under the multitranche financing facility subject to complying with the \ncity and subproject selection criteria outlined in the Framework Financing Agreement.  \n2  ADB. 2015.

Institutional capacity gaps. The Government of Tamil Nadu identified strengthening \ncapacity of ULBs and urban governance as priorities to improve performance in the urban sector. \nKey institutional challenges are (i) weak capacity of ULBs to plan, design and implement projects \nin a timely, cost-effective manner, and to sustainably operate and maintain such facilities; and (ii) \nthe weak capacity of CMA to support ULBs. ULBs find it difficult to mobilize sufficient human \nresources because of restrictive hiring rules and procedures, and rely increasingly on CMA to \nprovide investment planning and implementation support. Because funding is provided by the \ngovernment,  CMA\u2019s  need  for  appraisal  and  approval  capacity  has  also  increased.  Future \ninvestments will rely on ULB and CMA capacity to develop and execute projects. By strengthening \nthe capacity of the CMA to support ULBs, the capacity building technical assistance (TA) will \nstrengthen key urban institutions required for improved sector performance.   \n \n5.  Commissionerate of Municipal Administration, engineering wing. CMA\u2019s engineering \nwing  is  responsible  for  planning,  designing,  coordinating  and  supervising  all  the  urban \ninfrastructure investments in ULBs (except Chennai), with their responsibility varying with the ULB \nsize. CMA undertakes review and technical appraisal for large municipal corporations, and assists \nwith design, procurement and implementation for small ULBs. The engineering staff includes \nthree executive or higher-level engineers, and eight junior engineering positions. The capacity \nand resources of CMA\u2019s engineering wing needs to be strengthened to effectively support ULBs. \nDesign, preparation, and implementation of ULB investments was previously carried out by state-\nlevel agencies with engineering capacity (e.g., the Tamil Nadu Water and Drainage Board); \nCMA\u2019s responsibilities were moderate, and the current structure was adequate and sustainable. \nHowever, CMA is taking increasing responsibility for implementation in new areas (e.g., solid \nwaste management, fecal sludge management, and urban transport work) that are outside the \ndomain of other state-level agencies, as well as handling basic urban services such as water \nsupply and sanitation. In addition, responsibility for project implementation in general is being \ntransferred from government-owned corporations to larger ULBs, as part of the gradual devolution \nprocess under the Constitution (Seventy-fourth Amendment) Act, 1992. These trends will continue \nand the demand for project preparatory and implementation capacity support from CMA will \nincrease. Since fiscal year 2010, the compound annual growth rate for capital expenditures for \nULBs financed through MAWS was 21.9%.6  \n \n6.  Commissionerate of Municipal Administration project design and management. \nCMA will establish a dedicated project design and management cell (PDMC) responsible for \nsupporting ULBs in planning, design, supervision and project management, along with other \nadvisory  services  in  planning  and  development.  It  will  initially  be  staffed  by  redeploying \nengineering staff in the CMA and ULBs, with no new recruitment proposed in the short term. The \nprogram will support CMA in establishing the PDMC by: (i) funding required software and \nequipment (investment component); and (ii) strengthening capacity (grant component) through \ntraining,  exposure to  best  practices,  and  by  preparing manuals  and other  required  design \nguidelines. \n \n7.  Urban governance gaps.  The Government of Tamil Nadu identified the following areas \nfor improvement (i) financial management (i.e., large number of unresolved audit observations);7 \n(ii)  revenue  generation  (i.e.,  49%  collection  efficiency  of  user  charges  for  sewerage);8  (iii) \nadministration (i.e., 18.8% vacancy in key positions); and (iv) scaling up new approaches (i.e., \n                                                \n6  MAWS Policy Note 2009-10, MAWS Demand for grants 2017-18. \n7  As of June 2017, more than 148,672 audit observations were pending resolution. \n8  Low connection coverage is an issue\u201471.1% of households are connected to sewerage and water networks, as \ncompared to the project targets. \n ", "3 \nfecal  sludge  management  and  wastewater  reuse).  While  the  state  has  other  government-\nsupported  performance-based  reform  programs,  their  geographic  coverage  and  scope  are \nnarrow. For example, the incentive fund recommended by the Fifth State Finance Commission \nfocuses only on property tax, with other user charges excluded. The Atal Mission for Rejuvenation \nand Urban Transformation targets reforms in cities with populations over 100,000, excluding \nsmaller ULBs. No incentive fund covers all ULBs in Tamil Nadu, resulting in unbalanced sector \nperformance. \n \n8.  Urban data and governance improvement. In response, CMA will establish a new urban \ndata and governance improvement cell, which will be responsible for (i) collecting and analyzing \ndata on key governance parameters (finance, administration, service delivery, gender) of all ULBs \nin  the  state;  (ii)  conducting  research  into  key  performance  areas;  (iii)  administering  the \nperformance-based  governance  improvement  program  under  the  program;9  (iv)  providing \nadvisory services to ULBs in governance improvement; and (iv) providing Government of Tamil \nNadu with real-time data and analytics for policy making, budget planning, and allocations. The \nprogram will support CMA in establishing and strengthening the capacity of this unit by: (i) \nproviding performance-based funds to provide incentives to improve governance (investment \ncomponent); (ii) providing consultant services and information technology support (hardware and \nsoftware) for administering the governance improvement program under the program (investment \ncomponent); and (iii) strengthening capacity in governance reforms (grant TA component) through \ntrainings and exposure to best practices. CMA will engage an independent verification agency to \nconduct  annual  performance  assessments,  regular  data  collection,  field  verifications  and \nrecommend incentive payouts.10  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n \n9.  Output 1: Institutional capacity of the Commissionerate of Municipal Administration \nto support urban local bodies prepare and scale up urban infrastructure projects in Tamil \nNadu strengthened. Under the first output, key activities include (i) provide training, support, and \nexposure visits to PDMC staff to strengthen capacity in preparing feasibility studies, detailed \nproject report proposals, engineering designs, innovative approaches in planning and sustainable \nservices delivery\u2014spatial and land use planning, geographic information system technology, \nsmart applications, energy efficiency, and nonrevenue water management\u2014and operation and \nmaintenance of urban infrastructure;11 and (ii) prepare design manuals and standards for use by \nthe PDMC and ULBs in preparing new projects. \n \n10.  Output 2: Institutional capacity of the Commissionerate of Municipal Administration \nto implement urban governance improvement programs strengthened. Under the second \noutput, key activities include (i) providing training and exposure to best practices in urban \ngovernance and performance-based governance improvement programs, including converting \ndata into useful policy recommendations; and (ii) supporting CMA in drafting policy notes that use \ndata analysis results.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.1 million, of which $1.0 million will be financed on a grant  \n                                                \n9  CMA has experience in administering conditional grant release under the 13th and 14th Finance Commissions, and \nthe Model Cities component of the World Bank-funded Tamil Nadu Sustainable Urban Development Project. \n10 Independent validation is included in the terms of reference of the urban governance improvement and awareness \nconsultants under the Tamil Nadu Urban Flagship Investment Program.  \n11 Capacity building under output 1 may also include project implementation support to project ULBs, as required.  \n ", "4 \n   \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). The eligible expenditure items \nare (i) hiring national and international experts in relevant fields for preparing manuals, standards, \nand providing advisory services; (ii) training and workshops for relevant state and local officials; \nand (iii) national and international exposure visits for relevant state and local officials.12 The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation \nfor consultants, space for training and workshops, and other in-kind contributions.
