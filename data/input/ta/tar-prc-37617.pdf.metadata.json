During  the  2004  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC)  confirmed its request for technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to help the government of Liaoning Province (GLP) supply heating to \nthe urban poor, to be financed by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund.1 In April 2004, the \nFact-Finding Mission assessed the results of studies and determined the TA scope. The Mission \nheld discussions with representatives from the Government and GLP.  An understanding was \nreached  on  the  TA  goals,  purpose,  scope,  cost  estimates,  financing  and  implementation \narrangements, and  the consultants\u2019  terms of reference. The TA is included in the country \npipeline for 2004. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Urban heating demand in the PRC has grown rapidly due to rising incomes, privatization \nof housing, and housing sector growth. In million square meters (m2) of heated area, heating \ndemand has increased by an annual average rate of 17% from  1992 to 2003. Nationwide, \nresidential buildings account for about 70% of total space heating, and commercial and public \nbuildings for the rest. Heating demand in Liaoning has also been growing rapidly during the past \ndecade, with a 14% annual growth rate from 1992 to 2003. \n \n3.  Liaoning has a population of about 41 million, of which 55% live in urban areas. As an \nold industrial base of the PRC, Liaoning is dominated by heavy industry with old technology and \nlarge state-owned enterprises (SOEs).2 Because of its industrial structure and large urban \npopulation, Liaoning is the highest energy-consuming province in the PRC. Continued strong \neconomic  growth,  combined  with  significant  increase  in  urban  housing  construction,  has \nresulted in heating demand outpacing supply, particularly in the old section of cities. Most cities \nsuffer heating supply shortages that adversely affect the quality of life and health, particularly of \nthe poor. Liaoning has about 3% of the PRC\u2019s total population but accounts for about 10% of \ntotal unemployed. Since 1997, urban poverty has been increasing, as urban unemployment \nsoared mainly due to SOE reforms and technology changes, particularly retrenchment of excess \nemployees of large SOEs. \n \n4.  Most heating in cities comes from small coal-fired heat boilers, which emit substantial \namounts of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and total suspended particulates. \nPoverty is often compounded by environmental pollution from household heating sources. Some \nof the poor in Liaoning do not have the information about and access to, or cannot afford, \nefficient (less-polluting) appliances and fuels. Heat distribution systems usually function poorly \nor are even absent in the poor sections of cities. Poorly maintained heat distribution increases \nthe poor\u2019s exposure to daily doses of pollutants as well as the risk of accidents. Indoor air \npollution particularly puts women and children at risk. \n \n5.  The average heating tariff in Liaoning is about CNY20/m2.3 The average heating bill for a \npoor household living in a 40 m2 apartment unit is about CNY167 per month during the 5-month \nheating season. In a typical poor household of four people, for example, the income at the \npoverty line is CNY780 per household per month in Anshan, CNY624 in Benxi and Yingkou, and \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 7 February 2004. \n2  SOEs in Liaoning account for about one tenth of total SOEs in the PRC. \n3  The heating tariff of CNY20/m2 in Liaoning is comparable with about CNY20/m2 in Heilongjiang, CNY19.5/m2 in \nXinjiang, and CNY24/m2 in Beiijing. ", "2 \n \nCNY728 in Liaoyang.4 Thus, the heating bill represents a large portion of the poor household\u2019s \nmonthly income (21% in Anshan, 23% in Liaoyang, and 27% in Yingkou and Benxi), indicating \nthat poor households can barely afford heat. \n \n6.  In Liaoning,  where the winter temperature can dip to minus 35o Celsius, insufficient \nheating severely affects the quality of life and health of the poor.5 Limited public resources have \nforced the GLP to rely increasingly on household financing of heating, but the urban poor cannot \nafford the rising heating costs. The GLP has thus developed assistance programs to reduce \nheating costs. However, the programs only cover the poor below the city poverty lines, leaving a \nvast number of near-poor households to deal with unaffordable heating. Therefore, heating \nsupply policies need to be refined. Different heating supply options for the urban poor need to \nbe evaluated, and comprehensive heating assistance programs established, taking into account \nthe sustainability of the urban heating supply. \n \n7.  Consumers are charged for heating by living area, not actual consumption, and the \nheating tariff structure does not reflect the cost structure of heating services, resulting in \nwastage of heat.6 The urban heating service used to be treated as part of the welfare support \nsystem. Heating bills were fully or partly paid by employers. Due to reforms, a large number of \nSOEs in Liaoning became bankrupt or financially troubled, and they considerably reduced \npayment of employees\u2019 heating bills. Revenue collection efficiency thus dropped to 60\u201370% in \nthe late 1990s, worsening the financial problems of heating service companies (HSCs). Most \nHSCs in Liaoning are owned and operated by local governments. Urban heating is often priced \nbelow the supply cost, and HSCs require continuing financial and other support from local \ngovernment. HSCs have been losing money or are only marginally profitable. The heating tariff \nsetting, and approval and adjustment criteria and procedures lack transparency, and decisions \nare frequently influenced by political considerations. The commercial management of HSCs and \ngovernment  social  welfare  objectives  are  not  separate.  Though  the billing collection has \nimproved recently, urban heating cannot be sustained without further addressing HSCs\u2019 cost-\nrecovery problems. \n \n8.  ADB provided a TA in 2000 to help the Ministry of Construction reform the urban heating \nsector and promote sustainable urban heating supply in the PRC by (i) formulating pro-poor \nnational  heating  tariff  guidelines,  and  (ii)  establishing  an  effective  heating  tariff collection \nmechanism.7 Liaoning was a pilot province under the study. The TA recommendations were \nconsidered relevant and useful. Successful implementation of the pro-poor national heating tariff \nguidelines and an effective heating tariff collection mechanism will help solve the urban heating \nshortage, improve HSCs\u2019 financial viability, and ensure adequate and affordable heating for the \npoor.  However,  implementing  these  recommendations  requires  concrete  actions  and \ninvestments at the provincial level. The success of the pro-poor national heating tariff guidelines \nand improve HSCs\u2019 billing collection also depends critically on the GLP's ability to institutionalize \na system of close monitoring, supervision, and evaluation of policy implementation and impact \nat the provincial and local levels. \n                                                 \n4  The poverty level defined by the project cities is CNY195 per capita per month in Anshan, CNY156 in Benxi and \nYingkou, and CNY182 in Liaoyang. \n5  Poor housing exacerbates illnesses such as asthma, and reduces resistance to respiratory illnesses such as \ninfluenza, pneumonia, and bronchitis. For example, cardiovascular disease incidence in Shenyang is 12 times that \nin Shanghai in winter. \n6  Wastage is particularly high in old apartment buildings that have no radiator control valves to adjust room \ntemperatures. \n7  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Pro-Poor Urban Heating Tariff Reforms. \nManila. The TA is in its last stage of disseminating recommendations to Government departments. The TA is \nexpected to be completed in October 2004. ", "    3 \n \n9.  The  GLP  is  trying  hard  to  solve  urban  poverty  and  ensure  social  stability.  ADB's \noperational strategy in the PRC aims to achieve economic growth in an efficient, equitable, and \nsustainable manner. ADB\u2019s PRC energy sector strategy includes (i) developing cleaner energy \nsources; (ii) renovating and retrofitting facilities to improve efficiency, and reduce emissions; \n(iii) promoting the corporatization and commercialization of energy utilities; and (iv) reforming \npricing, and tariffs. The strategy is complemented by ADB's strategy for the environment sector, \nwhich supports the use of economic, supply-side, and other measures to ensure sustainable \nuse of natural resources, promote market-based pricing, encourage cost recovery, and disclose \nenvironmental information. The urban poor suffer the most from insufficient heating. The GLP is \ncommitted to provide adequate, affordable heating to the urban poor by reforming heating tariffs \nand  developing  assistance  programs.  The  TA  is  a  major  part  of  this  effort.  The  TA,  by \nimplementing pro-poor national heating tariff guidelines, improving cost recovery of HSCs, and \nengaging in active policy dialogue, is consistent with and supports the GLP\u2019s development \nobjectives and ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy. \n \n10.  The TA will also widen ADB\u2019s effort to increase heating supply through the Liaoning \nEnvironmental  Improvement  Project.8  By  improving  heating  supply  facilities  and  HSCs\u2019 \ninstitutional capacities, the Project will substantially  improve  HSCs\u2019  efficiency. The TA will \ndesign heating assistance programs for the poor, taking into account the efficiency gains under \nthe Project, including better assessment and discounts on connection fees and heating tariffs. \nTo ensure that the heating assistance program is sustainable, it will be managed by the project \ncity government and complemented by a heating assistance fund, heating tariff policies that \nfollow pro-poor national heating tariff guidelines, and close monitoring of implementation and \nimpact. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n11.  The TA objective is to help the GLP provide adequate, affordable heating for the urban \npoor by helping the GLP implement pro-poor national heating tariff guidelines and improve \nheating tariff collection; design heating assistance programs for the poor; and develop an \neffective monitoring, supervision, and evaluation system at the provincial and local levels. \n \n12.  The TA will (i) examine key urban heating supply issues; (ii) evaluate different heating \nsupply options for the urban poor; (iii) develop comprehensive heating assistance programs to \nensure adequate and affordable heating for the urban poor; (vi) assess  heating assistance \nprograms\u2019  economic,  poverty,  environmental,  and  financial  impact  in  selected  pilot  cities; \n(v) develop  a  system  of  monitoring,  supervision,  and  evaluation  of  implementation  at  the \nprovincial and local levels; (vi) involve the urban poor in design, implementation, and monitoring \nof heating assistance programs; (vii) identify and remove barriers to, and develop an action plan \nfor, implementation of  pro-poor national heating tariff guidelines and improve heating tariff \ncollection; (viii) conduct an international seminar; (ix) carry out a field study; and (x) conduct a \nconsultation workshop with the main stakeholders. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA will be carried out in three phases. During phase I, the consultant will gather data \nand conduct a preliminary analysis of issues relating to urban heating supply. The consultants \n                                                 \n8  The Project is expected to be approved by the ADB Board in 2004. ", "4 \n \nwill identify the main issues to be solved to achieve the TA objectives, and clarify the focus of the \nstudy and make a detailed analysis of the key province-specific urban heating supply issues. \nUnder phase II, the consultant will help the GLP  implement the pro-poor national heating tariff \nguidelines by preparing an action plan; analyzing urban heating supply and demand; examining \nkey  issues  relating  to  heating  technology,  investment  programs,  heating  tariffs,  collection \nmechanism, and legal and regulatory aspects of urban heating; and evaluating different supply \noptions for the urban poor. In phase III, the consultants will develop heating assistance programs \nto ensure adequate and affordable heating for the urban poor. The consultant will also assess \nthe impact of the proposed heating assistance programs from technical, institutional, economic, \nsocial,  financial,  pricing,  environmental,  and  poverty  viewpoints,  and  establish  an  effective \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  plan.  The  consultant  will  involve  the  urban  poor  in  design, \nimplementation,  and  monitoring  of  heating  assistance  programs,  and  discuss  the \nrecommendations in a workshop with the main stakeholders. The consultant will organize a final \nworkshop with the main stakeholders to disseminate the TA findings and recommendations. The \nconsultant will meet representatives of external funding agency, donor countries and institutions \nto find out their interest in helping the PRC supply heat to the urban poor. The outline terms of \nreference for consultant are in Appendix 2. \n \n14.  The consultant will help organize an international seminar on heating supply for the poor, \nto which international and domestic experts will be invited to present papers and participate in \ndiscussions. After the seminar, the consultant will summarize the discussions and identify the \nissues. The TA includes an international field study to expose selected personnel to the latest \ntrends  and  international  best  practices  in heating assistance  programs  for  the  poor.  GLP \npersonnel involved in policymaking and implementation of heating assistance programs for the \npoor will undertake the 10-day study. The consultant will consider the participants\u2019 specific needs \nand prepare a detailed proposal for ADB approval, specifying the (i) objectives of the field study, \n(ii) institutions to be visited, (iii) agenda for discussions and training, (iv) name and job description \nof each person nominated to participate, and (v) costs. Procedures to select participants will be \neconomical, efficient, and acceptable to ADB. At the end of the field study, the participants will \nsubmit to ADB a report summarizing their findings and recommendations. \n \n15.  The urban poor must participate in designing, implementing, and monitoring the heating \nassistance programs. Participatory activities will be developed to collect data from low-income \nheating users in the pilot cities and identify their special needs and priorities. The consultant will \nanalyze possibilities and develop strategies for urban poor participation in the design of heating \nassistance programs. In particular, the ability and willingness of urban households to use \nheating under the proposed heating assistance programs will be carefully assessed. \n \n16.  The major risks that need to be considered for successful TA implementation include \ninadequate counterpart support, inadequate and delayed provision of data, late submission of \nrequired  studies,  delayed  consultant  selection,  and  poor  consultant  performance.  The \nGovernment must continue to be committed to provide adequate, affordable heating to the poor, \nand to rationalize heating tariffs and make regulation transparent. A competent consultant firm \nwill be recruited on time. The GLP is committed to supplying adequate, affordable heating to the \nurban poor, and agreed to provide adequate counterpart support and data. Close coordination \namong the consultant, executing and implementing agencies, and ADB will further mitigate \nthese risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000 equivalent, with a foreign exchange cost of \n$322,000 and a local currency cost of $378,000 equivalent (Appendix 3). ADB will provide ", "    5 \n \n$500,000 equivalent to finance $322,000 of the foreign exchange cost and $178,000 equivalent \nof the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation  Fund  and  will  be  administered  by  ADB.  The  GLP  will  contribute  $200,000 \nequivalent, representing about 29% of the TA cost, to finance the remaining local currency cost. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The Liaoning Development and Reform Commission will be the Executing Agency.9 ADB \nwill select and engage the services of international and domestic consultants according to its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting \nand engaging domestic consultants. The consultants will have expertise in urban heating supply \nand engineering, heating tariffs, financial and economic analyses, institutional analysis, and \nurban poverty and environmental assessment. An estimated total of 29 person-months of \nconsulting services will be required: 8 for international and 21 for domestic. The services will be \nprovided through a consulting firm selected following the submission of simplified technical \nproposals  and  the  use  of  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection.  The  TA  is  expected  to \ncommence on 1 December 2004 and be completed by 30 September 2005. \n \n19.  The GLP will establish a counterpart team comprising representatives of the GLP, HSCs \nand local governments of the pilot-study cities.10 The counterpart team will closely interact with \nthe consultant. The GLP will also establish a steering committee comprising senior GLP officials \nand representatives from other government organizations and agencies that formulate and \nimplement urban heating policies. The steering committee will be the apex body that will convey \nand  interpret  the  Government\u2019s  views  on  policy  issues  and  generally  oversee  TA \nimplementation. The counterpart team members will interact with steering committee members \nto clarify matters that fall outside the GLP\u2019s purview. The GLP will provide interpreters, local \ntransportation, and suitably equipped office space in Shenyang. Computer and office equipment \nto be financed under the TA will be procured by the international consultant in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The consultants will establish an effective monitoring and \nevaluation system to monitor the impact of the TA, which will provide the basis for the GLP\u2019s \nimpact monitoring after the completion. The  monitoring and evaluation system will include \nspecific  and  measurable  targets,  and  identify  key  risks  and  institutional  arrangement  for \neffective monitoring. The consultants will also provide the necessary trainings on monitoring. \nWithin 3 to 5 years after the TA completion when development impacts should be evident, the \nGLP will carry out the impact assessment of the TA. In addition, the implementation of the \nLiaoning Environmental Improvement Project will last for next five years. This will provide \nopportunities for ADB staff to monitor the impact of the TA. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China to be financed on a grant basis  by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund for  Heating Supply for the Urban Poor in Liaoning Province, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n9  The commission is the most important GLP agency that promotes development and reform. \n10  The GLP and ADB will select and agree on the pilot cities during phase 1 of the TA.

The technical assistance (TA) will be carried out by a consulting firm with experience in \ntechnical,  institutional,  economic,  financial,  environmental,  and  social  analyses;  impact \nassessment;  heating  tariffs;  and  analysis  of  heating  subsidies.  The  team  of  international \nconsultants will consist of a heating tariff specialist, a power economist, a social impact analyst, \na financial analyst, and an institutional specialist. The study will require about 8 person-months \nof international and 21 person-months of domestic consulting services. To ensure effective \nassistance to the international consultants, the team of domestic consultants will have the same \ncomposition. The consultants will work in close collaboration with the government of Liaoning \nProvince (GLP) and ensure effective know-how transfer. The international consultants will be \nrecruited in accordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). \n \n2.  When the TA starts, the consultants will do a detailed background study to thoroughly \nunderstand  urban  heating  supply  issues  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).  The \nconsultants  will  review  reports  and  studies,  including  those  of  the  GLP  and  international \nagencies,  including  ADB,  World  Bank,  and  other  aid  agencies.  After  reviewing  the  basic \ninformation, the consultants will determine the selection criteria and number of pilot cities, and \nrecommend pilot cities for approval by the GLP and ADB. The consultants will discuss the \nGovernment's reform directions with members of the steering committee and counterpart team \nto establish a sound basis for the TA work. The consultants should evaluate the international \nexperience in related areas and its relevance to the PRC, and tailor their recommendations to \nensure they are relevant to and can be implemented in the PRC. The recommendations should \nfocus on how to make heating supply for the urban poor efficient.  \n \n3.
