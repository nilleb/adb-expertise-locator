INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will facilitate future investment in \nsustainable ocean economy development through two main activities: (i) assessing prospects for \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) to commercialize marine resources (including energy, \nseafood, and tourism) and identifying potential investment projects in selected DMCs; and (ii) \nengaging  stakeholders  and  managing  knowledge  on  mechanisms  to  facilitate  large-scale \ninvestments and accelerate financing of selected projects.  \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), specifically \nOperational Priority 3 on tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and \nenhancing environmental sustainability.1 The TA is aligned with United Nations Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal (SDG) 7 on affordable and clean energy and SDG 14 on life below water. It is \nalso aligned with ADB\u2019s Action Plan for Healthy Oceans and Sustainable Blue Economies2 and \ntargets DMCs with extensive coastlines (\u201clittoral states\u201d) and large exclusive economic zones.3 \nThe  TA  is  included  in  the  2020  management-approved results-based  work  plan of  ADB\u2019s \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The ocean economy today is dominated by energy production, fishing, shipping, and \ntourism. These activities are based on the \u201ctake, make, and dispose\u201d linear economy model and \nare inherently unsustainable. Ocean energy production is mainly crude oil and natural gas, large-\nscale marine fisheries have been depleted in many parts of Asia and the Pacific, ships run on \npetroleum fuels, and mass tourism is overwhelming the ecosystems of popular destinations. By \nnecessity, the ocean economy of the future will be based on renewable energy production and \nutilization,  regenerative  marine  aquaculture,  low-emissions  shipping,  and  ecotourism, \nimplemented in a manner that preserves, regenerates, and enhances marine ecosystems. In this \ncontext, archipelagic and island states potentially have a comparative advantage in creating \nsustainable energy and food supply chains that support cleaner shipping and ecotourism.  \n \n4.  The oceans contain enough renewable energy to power our civilization.5 Offshore wind, \nmarine floating solar, in-stream tidal conversion, and ocean biomass plants can all be deployed \nat gigawatt scale. Marine solar and offshore wind energy are increasingly cost-competitive \ncompared with fossil-fuel-based electricity generation, and in some locations these are producing \nsurplus energy that is being converted into hydrogen and oxygen using water electrolysis. \nEconomies of scale in manufacturing, technology efficiency improvements, factory-based mass \nproduction of key components, and plug-and-play architecture will lead to rapid declines in the \n \n1 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila; \nand ADB. 2019.

Manila. \n2  ADB. 2019. Action Plan for Healthy Oceans: Investing in Sustainable Marine Economies for Poverty Alleviation in \nAsia and the Pacific. Manila. \n3  DMCs will be identified based on (a) knowledge of ocean-based renewable energy and regenerative aquaculture \npotential, (b) government interest in commercial development with public and private sector investment, and (c) \nexisting infrastructure for proposed new investment projects. Informal discussions with DMCs are to be followed up \nwith virtual missions to confirm interest in the TA. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 October  2020. \n5  The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates the technical potential of offshore wind alone to be 420,000 terawatt-\nhours per year, compared with total global energy production of about 163,000 terawatt-hours in 2018. IEA. 2019. \nOffshore Wind Outlook 2019. Paris; and R. Cho. 2017. Tapping into Ocean Power. Columbia University Earth \nInstitute. 14 February. \n ", "2 \ncost of these technologies and encourage their wide-scale deployment.6 A key challenge is to \ndevelop  scalable  regenerative  infrastructure  to  convert  renewable  energy  into  discrete \ntransportable fuels or other tradable commodities such as ammonia, hydrogen, and methanol, \nsome of which could be used as cleaner fuel for marine transport across the region.7 The growth \nof  coral  on  offshore  petroleum  infrastructure  is  a  well-documented,  positive  synergistic \nphenomenon that can be augmented with cultivated reefs and regenerative seafood production.8 \nMarine-based renewable energy, reefs, and aquaculture can be co-located to create mutually \nbeneficial  ecosystems,  and  marine  energy  facilities  can  be  repurposed  and  designed  to \nincorporate tourism.9  \n \n5.  DMCs can reach the \u201ctipping point\u201d for rapid supply chain development by creating policies, \nregulations, and physical space in marine waters for the gigawatt-scale investment required, \nwhich will be primarily from commercial and non-traditional sources. DMCs need support to \ndevelop cross-sectoral institutional awareness. The TA will complement multiple activities that \nADB is undertaking regionally on ocean health, the hydrogen economy, coral reef insurance \nproducts, offshore renewable energy, and green ports. Consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, the \nTA  will  identify  opportunities  for  commercially  viable  integrated  development  of  marine \naquaculture, reefs, renewable energy, and ecotourism, for ecosystem services (MARES).  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: DMCs\u2019 capacity in optimizing marine resource \nvalue, creating new industries for export growth, and regenerating the marine environment \nimproved.10 The TA will have the following outcome: investments to promote regenerative marine \nbusiness mobilized.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Healthy ocean investments catalyzed. The TA will support an assessment of \nDMCs\u2019  existing  policies,  regulatory  frameworks,  technologies,  and  business  models  for \nencouraging investment in healthy oceans.12 Potential financing modalities will also be assessed, \nwith a focus on sea use and cultural issues to meet local community expectations. Local, national, \nand international stakeholders will be engaged to support and secure commitments to buy energy \n \n6  In 2015 the levelized cost of energy from offshore wind was $150\u2013$200 per megawatt-hour. In September 2019, an \noffshore wind farm off the United Kingdom signed a contract for $49.6 per megawatt-hour. The Economist Group. \n2020.

The \nInternational Maritime Organization has established stack emissions limits for sulfur, effective 1 January 2020, and \ngreenhouse gas limits effective in 2030 and 2050. Methanol is being used as a marine fuel\u2014see, for example, the \nSummeth Project. \n8  A case study of rigs to reefs can be found in: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 2019. \nRethinking Innovation for a Sustainable Ocean Economy. Paris. \n9  E.g., development of a tidal energy installation in South Korea included creation of a marine conservation area that \nhas become a major tourist attraction (https://blogs.adb.org/blog/how-sihwa-turned-tide-bespoiling-energy-plants).

The TA will \nsupport preliminary assessments of economic, environmental, social, and technical aspects of \ncandidate investments, with recommendations for further development via transaction TA within \nthe ADB Acton Plan for Healthy Oceans and Sustainable Blue Economy (footnote 2). Investment \noperations will include public\u2013private partnerships with sovereign and nonsovereign financial \nassistance.  The  frontier  business  models  and  leading  technology  to  be  explored  will  be \nparticularly promising for upper-middle-income countries, especially in the nonsovereign sphere. \n \n8.  Output 2: Knowledge in healthy oceans improved. Initial outcomes of the research, \nconsultations, and de-risking of prioritized investments in commercial activities in the four core \nMARES  areas  will  be  shared  with  DMC  governments,  local  communities,  and  other  key \nstakeholders through knowledge-sharing events including workshops, seminars and investor \nforums. The four core MARES areas are (i) marine energy (offshore solar, wind, tidal energy, etc.), \ncoupled  with  production  of  hydrogen  and  other  value-added  products;  (ii)  cultivated reefs, \nincluding rigs to reefs and living breakwaters for coastal zone defense; (iii) restoration of ocean \nhealth through regenerative  aquaculture; and (iv)  ecotourism. Activities in  marine resource \ndevelopment,  marine  renewable  energy,  renewable  energy  to  hydrogen,  and  regenerative \naquaculture and ecotourism business models, and the DMCs\u2019 policy and regulation framework \nwill be reviewed, as will the capacity of communities to engage in the underlying businesses. \nKnowledge products will be disseminated on ADB\u2019s website. Output 2 activities will be conducted \nin parallel with output 1. \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s  Value  Addition.  The  TA  will  facilitate  an  integrated  development  approach \ncombining the four core areas of MARES and emphasizing value-added economic activities. This \nTA project will explore new pathways to reduce, displace, and ultimately replace fossil fuels in \nresponding to climate change, while addressing ocean acidification\u2014a major problem caused by \ngreenhouse gas emissions.14 Examples and lessons from ADB\u2019s investment portfolio will be \napplied as appropriate.15 First, the TA will demonstrate how activities to promote healthy oceans \ncan be integrated into commercially viable investment opportunities to enhance the regenerative \ncapacity  of  the  ocean.  Second,  the  TA  will  leverage  ADB  engagement  with  regional  and \nsubregional platforms such as the Brunei Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines East \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations Growth Area and the Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand \nGrowth Triangle Subregional Programs, where ADB serves as a regional development partner \nand advisor. These platforms endorsed the concept of healthy oceans at their respective summits \nattended by ADB in 2019.  \n \n \n13 Liquified natural gas export projects and renewable fuels projects can inform the process of securing long-term     \npurchase agreements for hydrogen and other value-added products.  \n14 Riebesell et al. 2009.
