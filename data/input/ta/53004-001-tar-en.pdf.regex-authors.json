INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) to improve financial consumer protection. The proposed knowledge and \nsupport TA will support the legal department of the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) and the supervision \ndepartment of the Financial Regulatory Commission (FRC) of Mongolia to develop a coordinated \nframework for financial consumer protection. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan for Mongolia, 2019\u20132021.1  The scope is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 with \naim of strengthening governance and institutional capacity supporting access to finance.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Weak financial consumer protection capacity of financial supervisors. Mongolia has \nmade  progress  in  financial  consumer  protection  with  ADB  support  through  the  Supporting \nFinancial Sector Development and Stability TA project.3 The key output of that project was to \ndesign a road map to improve financial consumer protection practices in Mongolia. The result was \na strong national push to establish and expand financial consumer protection. Subsequently, \nMongolia\u2019s Parliament adopted a resolution in 2018 on Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2019 and \namended the Law on the Bank of Mongolia in 2018. The amended law provided the BOM with a \nclear mandate to protect the rights and interests of financial consumers. However, the BOM lacks \nthe staff, knowledge, and a clear program to supervise financial consumer rights. The BOM must \nestablish a unit for financial consumer protection to handle consumer complaints, which as of \n2019 were handled by either supervision staff or by the BOM public communications team. \nMeanwhile, the FRC established its own Protection of Investors\u2019 and Consumers\u2019 Rights Unit \nwithin its supervision department in 2015.4 The unit has five staff in charge of financial consumer \nprotection related to FRC-regulated entities, but these staff lack capacity and knowledge and the \nunit\u2019s scope of work is narrow.  The BOM and FRC share responsibility for financial consumer \nprotection but there are inefficient overlaps and gaps in this arrangement. \n \n3.  The Monetary Policy Guidelines require that the BOM and the FRC work jointly to protect \nthe rights of financial consumers in Mongolia, but the guidelines lack a mechanism for the two \nregulatory agencies to coordinate their work. Policy issues to be resolved include (i) updating \nspecific consumer protection regulations, (ii) creating a program for market-research-based \nsurveys of consumers, (iii) improving the transparency of financial consumer information, and (iv) \nestablishing programs to improve the public\u2019s understanding of financial consumer rights. No \nspecific law exists that governs protection of financial consumers. A joint working group staffed \nwith BOM and FRC representatives is established to produce a draft law on financial consumer \nprotection, to be submitted to Parliament in late 2019. The draft law is expected to pass as it is \nalready on Parliament\u2019s official legislative agenda for the Fall 2019 session and was initiated by \nthe BOM Governor following recommendations made through the results of the prior ADB TA \nproject (footnote 2). The working group has produced an initial draft of the law, but it will require \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2019\u20132021. Manila.  The TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 August 2019. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n3 ADB.  Mongolia:  Technical  Assistance  for  Supporting  Financial  Sector  Development  and  Stability. \nhttps://www.adb.org/projects/50017-001/main#project-overview. \n4  The Financial Regulatory Commission is the parliamentary authority for regulating and supervising nonbank financial \nmarkets. The FRC is mandated to supervise and regulate nonbank finance, including insurance, securities markets, \nand microfinance. According to the Law on Legal Status of FRC, the FRC exercises power over nonbank financial \ninstitutions, insurance companies and intermediaries, securities firms, and savings and credit cooperatives. \n ", "2 \nadditional work and finalization to ensure that it conforms with best international practices. The \nworking group must also draft regulations for the BOM and FRC to properly implement the law. \nWhile the BOM and FRC will remain generally responsible for supervision of financial consumer \nprotection within their own mandates, the planned overriding role of the BOM, as defined in the \nMonetary Policy Guidelines for 2019 and the amended Law on the Bank of Mongolia, will need to \nbe resolved in practice and a coordination mechanism established with the FRC.  \n \n4.  Lack of redress mechanisms for violations of financial consumers\u2019 rights. Financial \nconsumers in Mongolia have limited avenues to resolving disputes with financial institutions. They \nmust either go through the court system\u2014which is bureaucratic, time-consuming, and costly\u2014or \nthey can seek modest intervention from the BOM or the FRC. The BOM lacks a formal financial \nconsumer protection unit or mechanism; complaints to the BOM are therefore directed to their \nsupervision department or to its public communication arm. While the FRC does have a unit for \nfinancial consumer protection, this unit has limited staff and lacks the capacity to deal with a  broad \nand diverse range of financial consumer protection issues (e.g., issues related to securities \nissuance, domestic and foreign investors, saving and credit cooperatives, nonbank financial \ninstitutions, leasing, custodianship, and insurance policyholders). The draft law on financial \nconsumer protection will mandate the appointment of a financial ombudsman and an alternative \ndispute resolution (ADR) mechanism. The government is expected to provide the initial budget \nfunds for the independent financial ombudsman, but final decisions on the ombudsman\u2019s location, \nthe scope of activities and the funding have not yet been made.  \n \n5.  Weak knowledge of financial consumer protection among public. Financial consumer \nprotection and the consumers\u2019 knowledge of their rights are evolving areas. Since the global \nfinancial crisis of 2008, financial consumer protection has become more widely recognized as a \nsignificant factor in contributing to the long-term stability of financial systems and aiding economic \ndevelopment. Supervised by the BOM, banking is the dominant component of the Mongolian \nfinance sector, accounting for about 95% of the overall financial market. While banking services \nalready reach a sizeable share of the Mongolian population, other financial services such as \ninsurance, leasing, and investments and securities are growing rapidly. The FRC oversees these \nalternative financial services, ensuring consumers\u2019 rights and protecting them against malpractice. \nFinancial consumers in Mongolia are impaired by a lack of consistent and clear information about \ntheir rights, and fail to receive impartial advice on choosing financial products and services. This \nis even more evident for rural populations, which have more limited access to financial services \nand financial institutions. There are no standardized disclosure templates for financial products \nor calculation methods to be applied equally across all financial products thereby limiting financial \nconsumers\u2019 decision-making capacity and a clear communication of their rights. While the BOM \nand FRC have run financial literacy programs, these have focused mainly on teaching consumers \nabout financial products, services, and concepts.  \n \n ", "3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: a stable, sustainable, and balanced finance \nsector promoted.5 The TA will have the following outcome: oversight of financial consumer \nprotection strengthened.6 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n7.  The TA will help promote a coordinated and consistent financial consumer protection \nmechanism in Mongolia by (i) expanding the capacity of the BOM and the FRC to promote and \nsupport coordinated financial consumer protection, (ii) supporting a framework for establishing an \nindependent ombudsman office and ADR, and (iii) raising Mongolian consumers\u2019 and financial \nservice providers\u2019 awareness of financial consumer protection. The TA project will combine \ncapacity  development,  institutional  and  policy advice.  The TA  project  will  draw  upon  work \ncompleted through the Supporting Financial Sector Development and Stability project (footnote \n2), which supported the FRC and other finance sector counterparts in Mongolia. \n \n8.  Output 1: Capacity of the BOM and FRC to promote coordinated financial consumer \nprotection improved. This output will include: (i) technical support to finalize a draft law on \nfinancial consumer protection; (ii) developing an outline of the regulations, guidelines, and product \nand  service  disclosures  that  are  necessary  and  applicable  to  financial-services,  banking, \nmortgage,  consumer-credit,  investment,  and  insurance  products;  (iii)  support  for  the \nestablishment of a BOM unit-in-charge to supervise and enforce financial consumer protection; \n(iv) capacity development of FRC financial consumer protection staff and of staff assigned to the \nBOM\u2019s planned financial consumer protection unit; and (iv) a study tour by BOM and FRC officials \nto ADB member countries with developed financial consumer protection frameworks. Training for \nthe BOM and FRC staff will concentrate on disseminating knowledge about the procedures, \nmethods and tools employed in both developed as well as in developing countries with sound \npractices. Also, knowledge sharing on behavioral research about the conduct of consumers will \nbe  delivered.  An  international  conference  will  be  held  convening market  practitioners from \nselected ADB countries to transfer knowledge to Mongolian financial service providers and \nfinancial regulators. \n \n9.  Output 2: Draft framework for establishment of an independent Ombudsman office \nand Alternative Dispute Resolution prepared. This output will provide support for determining \nthe  best  institutional  and  corporate  governance  structure  for  an  effective  and  transparent \nombudsman office and ADR mechanism. The TA will support capacity-building for the office of \nthe financial ombudsman, including the creation of a manual of operations, template forms for \nsubmitting complaints, and a general outline of applicable policies. The TA will also support the \nestablishment of a website for the financial ombudsman, with functionality for consumers to \nsubmit complaints online and track the process of complaint resolution.  \n \n10.  Output 3: Mongolian consumers\u2019 and financial service providers\u2019 awareness of \nfinancial consumer protection raised. This output will include workshops for financial industry \n                                                \n5  Government of Mongolia. 2017.

Ulaanbaatar. \nAmong other initiatives, the program calls for improving citizens\u2019 accessibility to financial services; increasing the real \neconomic benefits of financial services to citizens by improving the quality of products and services; encouraging \ndelivery of additional financial services; and improving citizens\u2019 financial literacy. \n6  The Design and Monitoring Framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nassociations and financial institutions active in banking, insurance, and investment services. The \nworkshops will increase awareness about the importance of the new rules on financial consumer \nprotection. The workshops will cover the importance of complying with rules, rights of financial \nconsumers, and consequences of rules infringements. ADB will contract a research center or \nuniversity to perform public surveys of a sample of financial consumers at the inception of the \nproject and toward project completion to determine how the public\u2019s awareness of financial \nconsumer rights has improved. The output will also support the BOM and FRC to promote \nfinancial consumer education among the public. This output will also support the BOM and FRC \nto design leaflets, brochures, guides, and video spots to promote financial consumer education \nand consumer empowerment. Public outreach activities for financial consumer education will \ninclude educational events and training for financial institutions and financial consumers. Global \nonline information portals providing useful and practical experience on shopping for and selecting \nfinancial  products  and  services  by  financial  consumers  will  be  reviewed  to  make \nrecommendations for the application in Mongolia. Examples of these systems in developed \ncountries include the Australian Securities and Investments Commission\u2019s MoneySmart7 initiative \nand the UK\u2019s Money Advice Centre.8 The TA will organize events to train trainers (teachers, media \nrepresentatives, civil society organizations) on using financial products financial consumer rights. \nThe output will also support the BOM and FRC to promote financial consumer education among \nthe public. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $540,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2.  \n \n12.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, access \nto data and documents, conference rooms, printing, distribution of project materials to staff, and \nother in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.  The  executing  agency  is  the  Bank  of  Mongolia.  The \nimplementing agencies are the legal department of the BOM and the supervision department of \nthe FRC. The implementing agencies will jointly form a working group to carry out project activities \nsuch  as  organizing  workshops,  conferences,  and  the  study  tour.
