INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During the implementation of the ongoing small-scale technical assistance (TA) to the \nGovernment of People's Republic of China (PRC) on capacity development and financing of the \nfirst integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant,1 some critical capacity, policy, \nand strategic analysis gaps were noted that could delay moving forward on carbon dioxide \ncapture and storage (CCS) opportunities. The capacity development TA2 was conceptualized \nwith the Department of Climate Change, National Development and Reform Commission (CC-\nNDRC) and the Ministry of Finance during a Reconnaissance Mission in November 2008. \nDuring  the  Country  Programming  Mission  in  December  2008,  the  Government  formally \nrequested the inclusion of the TA in the 2009 country program. The TA design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The PRC is the world\u2019s second-largest energy consumer after the United States and has \nthe fastest growing energy sector in the world in terms of both consumption and generation. In \n2007, the PRC generated 3,256 terawatt-hours of electricity. Almost 83% of the total came from \nburning coal; 15% from hydropower; and 2% from nuclear, wind, and other alternative sources. \nElectricity generation consumed more than 55% of the 2.53 billion tons of coal produced in 2007. \nThe Government has prioritized diversifying the energy mix to include more renewable, nuclear, \nand other alternative sources. However, coal will remain the dominant source of electricity \nproduction until at least 2030. Globally, electricity generation accounts for almost 30% of carbon \ndioxide (CO ) emissions. CCS is an integral part of all strategies to reduce greenhouse gas \n2  \nemissions proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International \nEnergy Agency (IEA).  \n \n3.  The Government\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan, 2006\u20132010 aims to achieve a resource-effective \nand environment-friendly harmonious society, and targets a 20% reduction in energy intensity. \nAdvanced coal-based electricity generation with higher efficiency on a par with international best \npractices  has  already  led  to  many  supercritical  and  ultra-supercritical  (USC)  plants  in  the \ncountry\u2019s new generation stock.3 The feasibility of a 250-megawatt IGCC power plant at Tianjin \nis  being  considered. 4  This  plant  is  expected  to  be  operational  by  2010.  The  likely \nimplementation of an IGCC plant provides the enabling power plant technology to contemplate \ncost-competitive precombustion CCS options, while the widespread use of USC plants does the \nsame for post-combustion CCS options.5  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of China for Capacity Strengthening in Planning and \nImplementation of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Plant. Manila (TA 7146-PRC, approved on 8 October, \nfor $200,000). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 23 January 2009. \n3  The supercritical and USC plants refer to the above critical points of water (374 degrees celsius [C] and \n22.15 megapascals  [MPa]).  The  supercritical  plants  typically  operate  in  the  400\u2013500oC  range  with  thermal \nefficiencies of around 40%; and latest USC plants operate at 600oC and 30 MPa with thermal efficiencies of more \nthan 46%. These above critical efficiencies are significantly higher compared to mid-thirties efficiencies from \nsubcritical plants. Every 1% efficiency gain typically corresponds to about 2.5 million ton of avoided CO  emissions \n2\nover the 30 years life of the plant.  \n4  IGCC is a technology that turns coal into gas\u2014synthetic gas (syngas), which is used to power a gas turbine whose \nwaste heat is passed to a steam turbine system (combined cycle gas turbine). The impurities from the syngas, \nincluding CO , can be removed/captured before its combustion, which allows low-cost capture in a CCS project.     \n2\n5  The CCS application on high-efficiency coal-fired power plants such as IGCC and USC allows the capture and \npermanent storage of almost all of the CO  emissions, thus making them plants with near zero emissions.    \n2\n ", "2   \n \n4.  CCS is in its early stage of development internationally, and demonstration projects \nurgently need to be undertaken. There is no industrial-scale coal-based power plant with CCS.6 \nIEA, in its Report to the (2008) G8 Summit7 in Hokkaido, Japan, recommended that at least 20 \nfully integrated industrial-scale demonstration power plants with CCS be committed and new \ngeneration stock be prepared for future CCS retrofit. The full benefit of CCS cannot be achieved \nunless the CCS technology is demonstrated and deployed in major coal-based developing \neconomies such as India and the PRC, where most of the new generation capacity will be \nadded.  \n \n5.  Recognizing the central role of coal in its energy security, the Government of the PRC \nlaunched the GreenGen Program in September 2005. The NDRC and the Ministry of Science \nand Technology support the program. The Greengen Co. Ltd (Greengen) was established in \nDecember 2005 with a mandate to lead the research, development, and demonstration of clean \ncoal technologies; and to develop a near-zero emission, coal-based power plant in the PRC by \n2015.8 Greengen has identified a three-step technological development process to achieve this \nstrategic  objective.  In  the  first  phase  (2006\u20132010),  a  250-megawatt  IGCC  plant  is  being \ndesigned and constructed at Tianjin.9  \n  \n6.  Technologically, the GreenGen Program is in sync with CCS development in developed \ncountries. However, in the absence of any regulatory need and economic drivers,10 the PRC \nmust balance its rapid growth agenda with investing in a promising but expensive, high-risk \ntechnology that may be crucial to its long-term energy security. Moreover, CCS projects will \noperate in a complex implementation structure,11 which will require pre-implementation work on \nan unprecedented scale with accompanying legal and regulatory issues and challenges. A \ncomprehensive analysis of these issues is urgently needed, including providing a demonstration \noutlook, identifying gaps, providing capacity building in all aspects of the CCS chain, and \ndeveloping a clear road map for CCS demonstration in the PRC.  \n \n7.  Two complementary bilateral initiatives are being implemented in the PRC: (i) the United \nKingdom\u2013PRC Near-Zero Emission Coal Project, supported by the Government of the United \nKingdom; and (ii) the European Commission-supported Cooperation Action within CCS China\u2013\nEuropean Union Project. Both of these bilateral initiatives take long-term, phased approaches, \nfocusing on knowledge sharing and capacity building up to 2010; and then identifying and \npreparing a CCS project for implementation by 2013. These ongoing interventions will provide \nuseful and relevant analysis. However, moving from knowledge sharing to strategic analysis for \nformulating policies and preparing a demonstration project for investment will pose unique \nchallenges that would be best served by a multilateral approach with clear understanding of \nregional issues, the policy environment, and the economic imperatives.12  \n \n                                                 \n6  The CCS community generally regards an industrial-scale power plant with CCS when at least 1 million tons of \nCO  annually is permanently stored in geological formations.   \n2\n7 G8  Information  Centre.  8  July  2008.  IEA  Work  for  the  G8:  2008  Messages.  Available: \nhttp://www.g8.utoronto.ca/summit/2008hokkaido/2008-iea.pdf  \n8  Greengen is a state-owned enterprise. Seven major energy enterprises in the PRC participate in the collaborative \ncompany, including all five major generators and the two largest coal producers. China Huaneng Group is the \nmanaging partner with a 52% equity stake.   \n9 Tianjin IGCC project is included in the Country Programming Mission for the People's Republic of China (2009\u2013\n2011) for ADB financing. \n10 Because of its low per capita greenhouse gas emissions, the PRC has no mandatory emission reduction targets; \nCCS is not recognized as an eligible technology under the Clean Development Mechanism.   \n11 The CCS project will extend beyond a traditional power plant boundary and to possible oil and/or gas fields or coal \nmines.  \n12 Multilateral development banks are perceived as neutral and honest facilitators for technology transfer approaches \nand policy analysis, which are crucial elements for in the deployment of CCS technologies in developing countries.  \n ", "  3\n8.  The Government supports the timely input from the TA to complement the ongoing and \nplanned efforts of other development partners and to assist in the comprehensive analysis of \nkey issues\u2014institutional, legal, regulatory, policy, and concessional financing\u2014that will help the \ndecision and policy makers in considering a strategic approach to CCS demonstration in the \nshort-term  and  its  future  deployment.  Early  preparation  of  a  forward-looking,  low-carbon \ntechnology and its likely demonstration will keep the GreenGen Program on target.  \n \n9.  The TA is a logical extension of the ongoing support of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to the first IGCC demonstration power plant in the PRC. It is directly relevant to the \ncountry partnership strategy (CPS), 2008\u20132010.13 The proposed TA will directly address the \nresource efficiency and environmental sustainability pillar of the CPS by developing in-country \ncapacity in an emerging near-zero emission technology for the coal-dependent energy sector. \nClean coal technology development is one of the priority areas of the energy sector intervention \nin the CPS.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the TA will be the formulation of a draft strategy for CCS deployment in \nthe  PRC.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  greater  capacity  to  plan  and  manage  the  CCS \ndemonstration project. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The key outputs of the TA include (i) a comprehensive road map for CCS demonstration \nprojects;  (ii)  essential  enabling  policies,  and  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks,  for  CCS \ndemonstration; (iii) identification of priority demonstration projects and associated financing \nneeds; and (iv) capacity assessment and comprehensive capacity development in critical areas \nof CCS demonstration.  \n \n12.  The main activities of the TA will be to  \n(i)  take stock of all relevant international efforts and their relevance to the PRC;  \n(ii)  identify strategic choices and their cost\u2013benefit comparisons on the complete \nCCS cycle\u2014capture technologies (precombustion and/or post-combustion), CO  \n2\nchain\u2014utilization, and storage;  \n(iii)  analyze  and  recommend  a  potential  road  map  for  CCS  demonstration,  and \nidentify key barriers;  \n(iv)  evaluate international legal and regulatory frameworks (European Union directive, \nLondon Protocol, Australian legislation, and others) and their relevance to the \nPRC;  \n(v)  identify capacity gaps and recommend a capacity strengthening plan, targeting \npolicy and decision-making institutions and government agencies;  \n(vi)  identify potential priority technologies and sites for demonstration projects, and \nundertake further research and preliminary prefeasibility assessment;  \n(vii)  identify cost gaps and examine the availability of concessional funding, such as \nClimate Investment Funds and their relevance;  \nThe view(vsi iei)x precsrsiteicda hlleyr eienx aarme itnheo seth oef  thseo ccoionescuoltannotm aincd  dimo pnaoct tnse, ceinsscaluridlyin rge prtehsee net tfhfeocste  ooff  ADCBC\u2019Ss  \nmembers, Boardte ocf hDniroeloctgoiress,  Monan ealgeecmtriecnitty,  oprr sictainffg, ;a  nd may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "4   \n \n(ix)  identify  policy  measures  and  innovative  financing  that  may  enhance  the \neconomic impacts of CCS at an affordable cost; and  \n(x)  widely disseminate technical expertise on CCS technologies in conjunction with \nrelevant research institutions in the PRC and key stakeholders.   \n \n13.  In the initial stages of TA implementation, a stakeholders network will be established. \nThroughout  TA  implementation,  close  coordination  will  be  maintained  with  the  Executing \nAgency (EA), Implementing Agency (IA), and the stakeholders network to ensure that the TA \ntakes into account, among others, the previous studies, Government priorities, existing plans, \nand results of complementary projects, and avoids any repetition. The key assumptions and \nrisks are in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). CCS is in the early stages of \ndevelopment, and the economic rationale and incentives in the PRC are uncertain. Thus, the \nmajor  risk  is  that  reaching  a  consensus  on  the  road  map  and  associated  policy \nrecommendations  may  take  considerable  time  and  effort,  likely  extending  beyond  the  TA \nimplementation  phase.  However,  the  TA  is  designed  and  will  be  implemented  in  close \ncoordination with the apex national policy and decision-making agency, CC-NDRC, which is the \nEA. This will ensure that the TA outputs will provide critical input to the emerging national \npriorities and plans. To enhance the relevance of the TA outputs to national plans and policies, \nan innovative approach is warranted in selecting the right experts and policy analysts for the TA \n(paras. 16\u201317).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.55 million. The Government has requested \nADB to finance the equivalent of $1.25 million, of which $1.00 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Climate Change Fund (CCF)14 and $250,000 by a grant from ADB's TA special \nfund-others. The Government will finance the remaining $300,000 of the total cost through in-\nkind contributions, including office accommodation and support facilities,15 counterpart staff, and \ndata and other information needed for the TA. The TA will finance some office equipment,16 \nwhich will be procured by Greengen in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, \nas amended from time to time) and handed over to the CC-NDRC upon completion of the TA. \nGreengen will provide the counterpart in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and cofinancing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The CC-NDRC will be the EA for the TA. Greengen will be the IA responsible for day-to-\nday implementation of TA activities, coordination with other key stakeholders, and logistical \nsupport to the consultants, among others. Greengen has created a project management office \n(PMO) in its head office in Beijing to provide management support for TA implementation.  \n \n16.  About 75 person-months of consulting services will be required (10 person-months for \ninternational consultants and 65 person-months for national consultants). ADB will engage \ninternational and national consultants, according to its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n                                                 \n14 The CCF is established by ADB. \n15 The consultant team will be provided with suitable office accommodation and office equipment at the Greengen \noffice in Beijing. The IA will pay for the office utilities (electricity and water). A telephone line will be provided, but \nthe consultants will pay the bills for its usage, which is provided for under the communication cost estimates in the \nTA.  \n16 The indicative list of equipment is at footnote d of the cost estimates and financing plan (Appendix 2). The list of \nequipment reflects the anticipated needs of a large group of consultants and extensive dissemination and \nknowledge services, which will be carried out throughout TA implementation.  \n ", "  5\n(2007, as amended from time to time). Because of the emerging nature of the technology, as \nwell as the limited information sharing commercially, very few (if any) international consulting \nfirms have core expertise in CCS with a credible record across the whole CCS chain. Being the \nfirst of such CCS intervention, ADB will first seek expressions of interest (EOI) from consulting \nfirms, which will be evaluated to check their qualification in terms of\u2014consulting firms' expertise \nand proven experience in similar activities in the last 5 years and their ability to engage with \nappropriate research institutes and knowledge centers internationally and in the PRC to meet \nthe requirements of expertise across the whole CCS chain (capture, transport and storage, and \nlegal and regulatory issues). In case no qualified EOIs were received by due date, ADB will then \nseek  assistance  from  major  international  institutions  and  knowledge  centers\u2014such  as  the \nCarbon Sequestration Leadership Forum; Global CCS Institute, Australia; and IEA17\u2014to identify \nand  engage  individual  international  and  national  experts  following  the  selection method  of \nindividual consultants.  \n \n17.  The international consultants will have expertise in (i) CCS strategy development; (ii) \ntechnical areas over the whole CCS chain, especially capture and storage; (iii) policy, legal, and \nregulatory issues; and (iv) financial modeling and analysis. The national consultants will have \nexpertise similar to that of the international consultants, as well as in-depth knowledge and \nexpertise in these areas in the PRC. The international CCS expert will be the team leader and \nthe national CCS technical expert will be the co-team leader. Together, they will coordinate the \nactivities of all consultants. The national consultants will also include a coordinator to support \nthe co-team leader in administering and managing a large group of national consultants. The \ncoordinator will strengthen support to the PMO and enhance coordination between stakeholders, \nthe EA, the IA, and ADB throughout the TA implementation. The outline terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. The procurement and disposal of equipment (para. 15) during \nthe TA implementation will be carried out in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines. \nThe  disbursement  arrangement  under  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.18 \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over about 12 months beginning May 2009 and finishing on \n30 April 2010. The consultants will submit an inception report within 4 weeks, an interim report \nwithin 12 weeks, a midterm report within 25 weeks, a draft final report within 40 weeks, and the \nfinal report within 48 weeks of field mobilization. Information on implementation progress and TA \noutputs will be disseminated through regular workshops and seminars. The outcome of the TA \nwill be subject to evaluation by ADB and the Government, in accordance with their respective \nevaluation policies and requirements.  \n \nIV.
