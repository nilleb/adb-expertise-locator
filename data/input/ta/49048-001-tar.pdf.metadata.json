INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Punjab Irrigation Department (PID) was established in 1849 for diverting water from \nrivers to farms for irrigation. Several changes have occurred in the irrigated area during the last \nsix decades: (i) waterlogging and salinity, causing land degradation; (ii) poor drainage, resulting \nin declined crop production; (iii) shallow groundwater that meets about 40% of the irrigation \nwater demand but is overexploited; and (iv) increased water-related disaster risks, including \nfloods, droughts, and water quality degradation. Over the same period, agricultural drainage, \nwaterlogging, and urban and industrial wastewater have significantly increased the marginal-\nquality water, which needs appropriate management for safe use and disposal. \n \n2.  Comprehensive management of water resources and water-related disasters requires \noperationalizing integrated water resources management (IWRM) and water-related disaster \nrisk management (DRM) approaches. These are beyond the mandate and capacity of PID in its \ntraditional  role  of  irrigation  water  delivery.  Further,  cross-sector  water  competition  causes \nconflicts among water users. This capacity development technical assistance (TA) was included \nin the country operations business plan for Pakistan, 2015\u20132017 of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB)1 through an extensive consultation process.2 During consultation missions (19\u201327 \nMarch  2015  and  14\u201328  March  2016),  ADB  conducted  meetings  with  PID\u2014the  executing \nagency\u2014and  other  stakeholders,  including  civil  society  representatives,  academics,  and \nindependent consultants. The executing agency and the Government of Punjab concurred with \nthe impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost and financing arrangements, \nand terms of reference for consultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The century-old PID is not capable of managing diversified and complex water issues \n(para. 1) and has no capacity to operationalize emerging approaches such as IWRM and DRM \n(para. 2). The piecemeal efforts of irrigation reforms by ADB and partners during 1998\u20132013 \nwere not fully successful. Thus, a comprehensive policy and institutional review and a complete \ntransformation of PID into a responsive water resources department (WRD) are required. ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2015\u20132019 for Pakistan3 focuses on six sectors. For agriculture, \nwhich encompasses irrigation (irrigated agriculture produces 90% of the food in Pakistan),4 the \ncountry partnership strategy emphasizes institutional effectiveness to enhance productivity and \nis in line with the Pakistan Vision 2025,5 which emphasizes water, energy, and food security. \nPunjab\u2019s midterm development framework, 2015\u201320186 prioritizes reliable irrigation supplies, \nenhanced  agricultural  productivity,  improved  rural  economy,  and  broad-based  institutional \nreforms. \n \n4.  The World  Bank  initiated  irrigation  and  drainage  reforms  through  sector  investment \nproject7 and policy loans.8 The Japan International Cooperation Agency also supported the \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

The  TA  is  necessary  to  develop  a  framework  and  action  plan  for  institutional \ntransformation, and contribute to the sustainability of the investment program. It will support full \ntransformation of PID based on the previous and ongoing reforms (para. 4). However, the TA \nwill not be able to support the complete modernization of the WRD due to time and financial \nconstraints, hence a TA loan will be required to support the medium- to long-term needs of the \ninstitutional transformation.11 The TA loan will include upgrading research and development \nfacilities, capacity building, and a project preparatory facility to prepare new projects. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact will be aligned with increased water and food security, and reduced water-\nrelated disaster risks through improved water policy and institution. The outcome will be the \ncomprehensive management of Punjab\u2019s water resources and water-related disaster risks. The \noutcome will be monitored through (i) the adoption of basin-based IWRM12 and water-related \nDRM approaches by the new WRD; and (ii) the approval of an act to enforce levies, cost \nrecovery, and licensing practices by the Government of Punjab by 2019. The TA will achieve \nimproved capacity of the WRD in (i) planning; (ii) developmental research and operational \nmanagement;  (iii)  irrigation  and  drainage; (iv)  water-related  DRM;  (v)  river  ecosystem;  (vi) \ngroundwater management; and (vii) marginal quality water management. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA outputs are as follows: (i) the new WRD is functional, and (ii) the capacity of the \nWRD is enhanced. The outputs are strongly related to the outcome through a functional WRD \nand improved policy legislation, and capacity of the staff. The outputs will be achieved through (i) \na review of ongoing and past reforms initiatives and lessons learned; (ii) a needs assessment \nfor better technical, institutional, and policy options; (iii) stakeholders\u2019 consensus building for the \nchange through the transformation; and (iv) improvement in policy, legislation, and capacity \nbuilding for effective change management. The (i) preparation of Punjab\u2019s Water Vision 2030 \nand  water  resources  information  system  (WRIS);  and  (ii)  introduction  of  basin-based \nmanagement approaches of IWRM, water-related DRM, and information and communication \n                                                                                                                                                       \n8  World Bank. 2010.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program. Manila. \n11 WRD will require modernization of both institution and infrastructure, including laboratories, research, modeling, \nand water monitoring facilities; and advanced staff training on water resource planning, hydroinformatics, and \nclimate change impacts.  \n12 IWRM approach will allow improved basin planning through close monitoring and evaluation of the actions for \nimproved management and sustainable development. \n ", "  3 \ntechnology in resource management will help achieve sustainable management of the water \nresources. \n \n8.  Output 1 will (i) support comprehensive review of all the water-related sectors and \nsubsectors; (ii) assess the transformation needs; (iii) identify technical and institutional gaps; (iv) \nadvise on technical, institutional, and policy options; (v) develop new organizational structure of \nthe WRD;  and  (vi)  provide  help  for  stakeholders\u2019  consultation  and  governmental  approval \nprocesses. \n \n9.  Output 2 will (i) help prepare a water vision; (ii) carry out policy review; (iii) 10\u201320 years \ninvestment programs and institutional transformation plans; (iv) process a TA loan to support \nand  strengthen  the  institutional  transformation;  and  (v)  support  capacity  building,  including \npromotion of the quality infrastructure investment. \n \n10.  Output 2 will also help develop a WRIS using satellite-based remote sensing technology \nand a geographic information system for cost-effective monitoring, evaluation, and management \nof  the  water  resources.  The WRIS  will  provide  information  on  water  resources, flood  and \ndrought risks, and irrigation-related assessment in close collaboration with the Japan Aerospace \nExploration Agency. The WRIS will be an integral part of the institutional transformation. A delay \nin the approval process by the government is considered the main risk. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $3,070,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) and $2,000,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The \ngovernment will provide a cash contribution of $100,000 equivalent, which will not be transferred \nto  ADB,  and  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space  and  field \naccommodation, secretarial assistance, use of PID\u2019s facilities, access to data, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  PID  will  be  the  executing  agency for the TA.  ADB  will  implement the TA  in  close \nconsultation  with  PID  during  January  2017\u2013December  2019.  The  Punjab  Planning  and \nDevelopment Department will oversee the TA implementation. \n \n13.  PID  will  provide  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space  and  field \naccommodation, secretarial assistance, use of its facilities, access to data, and coordination \nwith other departments and agencies in the Government of Punjab. \n \n14.  PID is committed and has already started (i) developing a basin-based IWRM approach, \n(ii) reviewing the legal framework for institutional transformation, (iii) reviewing ongoing irrigation \nand drainage reforms, and (iv) establishing a hydraulic structures safety evaluation unit using its \nown resources. \n \n15.  Consultancy  services  for  (i)  change  management,  (ii)  revitalizing  research  and \ndevelopment, and (iii) capacity building will be provided through individual consultants and an \ninternational firm. The terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The individual \nconsultants will act as a core group and will be housed in PID office for effective communication \nand coordination and support. The TA coordinator and deputy TA coordinator will steer and \n ", "4   \nguide the transformation process. Individual consultants will also be recruited to develop a \nsatellite-based WRIS. For technical, institutional, and policy-related inputs, a firm will be hired to \nprovide support in the fields of IWRM, flood and drought, dams, and irrigation and drainage. The \nfirm will be selected using the quality-based selection method, as (i) the assignment is complex \nand highly specialized, making it difficult to define precise terms of reference and the required \ninputs from the consultants; and (ii) the downstream impact is large and the quality of the \nservices will be of overriding importance for the outcome of the TA. Services of appropriately \nqualified resource persons from ADB or elsewhere will be used to conduct workshops and share \nknowledge on the WRIS and quality infrastructure investment. \n \n16.  Provisional sums for enhancing research capabilities and upgrading research facilities \nincluding the Irrigation Research Institute of PID and groundwater modeling will be provided. \nSeveral relevant international hydraulic research institutes have been identified to help in the \nhydraulic research and training, including Deltares (the Netherlands), HR Wallingford (United \nKingdom), UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education (the Netherlands), Asian Institute of \nTechnology  (Thailand),  International  Water  Centre  (Australia),  and  International  Centre  for \nWater Hazard and Risk Management (Japan). The training coordinator will be paid from the \ncontribution  of  the  Government  of  Punjab  to  this  TA.  The  international  hydraulic  research \ninstitutes  will  be  recruited  through  the  consultants\u2019  qualification  selection  method,  as  the \nassignment is highly specialized and only a few qualified institutes are available; evaluation of \ncompetitive proposals is therefore not justified. \n \n17.  Best international practices of change management will be thoroughly analyzed by the \ngovernment,  ADB,  and  the  consultant  team  before  recommending  any  new  ideas  for \ntransformation. The consultants will work closely with the government through sharing office, \nfrequent  consultation,  and  stakeholders\u2019  consultation  workshops  to  avoid  any  setbacks  or \nsurprises. \n \n18.  Consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  TA  funds  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime  to  time).  All  equipment  under  the  TA  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  Dissemination of the expected outputs and outcome will be done through knowledge \nproducts, PID\u2019s knowledge portal, as well as by inviting representatives from other provinces in \nPakistan to participate in workshops and seminars. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction; and (ii) ADB providing the \nbalance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of \nPakistan  for  Institutional  Transformation  of  the  Punjab  Irrigation  Department  to  a  Water \nResources Department, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Technical Assistance is Aligned With: \nIncreased water and food security, and reduced water-related disaster risks through improved water \npolicy and institution.
