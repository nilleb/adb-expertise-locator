Despite significant progress in financial inclusion an estimated 2 billion adults remain \nunbanked globally, with Asia and the Pacific accounting for more than 55%1. Approximately 52%-\n64% of the 60-70 million microenterprises in Asia and the Pacific are unserved or underserved, \ntranslating to an estimated credit gap of $400-500 billion.2 Historically, banks have not serviced \nlow-income customers, primarily because of the perception of high risk, small loan amounts, lack \nof proper identification, and absence of credit history and collateral. Microfinance institutions \n(MFIs) typically catering to this market segment are often not deposit taking and thus require \nexternal funding sources.   \n \n2.  Many  elements  are  needed  to  support  the  development  and  growth  of  a  healthy \nmicrofinance industry, including a sound and transparent legal and regulatory environment, \nnational identification systems to aid know your customer identification, and credit bureaus to \ncontribute to industry transparency and prevention of client overindebtedness. However, one of \nthe greatest challenges for the microfinance industry is accessing commercial funding to support \ngrowth  and  meet  the  demands  of their  clients. With  diminishing  donor  and grant funding, \ndiversification  of  funding  sources,  including  commercial,  is  required.  Attracting  commercial \nfunding, however, can be difficult, especially for smaller institutions. Many domestic financial \ninstitutions are reluctant to lend to MFIs, unless there are government-specified targets with \nfinancial penalties for non-compliance. While impact funds, bilateral and multilateral development \nfinance banks provide loans to MFIs, the financing gap remains quite large. Additionally, most of \nthese funds are denominated in foreign currency which increases risk for the MFIs unless such \nMFIs can hedge this risk in their respective markets. Therefore, access to diversified and \naffordable commercial sources of financing, including capital markets, in local currency is critical \nto expand operations and reach more low-income borrowers. \n \n3.  The microfinance risk participation and guarantee program (MFP), approved in 2010, fills \nthis market gap by catalyzing commercial financing from the private sector.  Through the program, \nADB shares risks with accredited partner financial institutions (PFIs) to facilitate local currency \nlending to the microfinance sector. Due to the program\u2019s success and increased market demand, \nthe ADB Board of Directors removed the program expiration date and included it into ADB\u2019s \nmainstream operations. Through November 2017, the program has supported $598 million of new \nloans (with cofinancing of $315 million), reaching 3.45 million borrowers, mostly women. The \nprogram operates in Bangladesh, India and Indonesia, with the bulk of exposure in India. One of \nthe program\u2019s strongest attribute is its ability to support MFIs through various stages of growth. \nSome of the MFIs in India have grown significantly over time and are now converting to small \nfinance banks and exiting the program. Several of these larger ones are now being funded directly \nby ADB outside the program through long-term debt and equity.3  \n \n                                                \n1  A.

An additional program limit of $100 million (bringing the program\u2019s overall limit to $340 \nmillion) and major change in scope for the program was approved  by  ADB\u2019s Board of Directors \non 13 December 2017 (Report and Recommendation of the President under list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 3). To expand the program into different countries with microfinance \nsectors at varying levels of maturity and to continue to facilitate funding to MFIs in existing \ncountries, it has become evident that ADB needs to have varying strategies, structures and \nproducts. For example, in India the microfinance sector has experienced strong growth and larger \nMFIs have been able to obtain debt and equity from different sources, as well as tap domestic \ncapital markets on a limited basis to decrease dependencies on commercial banks through bond \nissuances and securitization transactions.4 However, the market becomes illiquid beyond highest \nrated MFIs with investors shying away from lower rated, smaller institutions and affordable \ncommercial funding becomes limited for smaller MFIs (38% of funding for mid-sized MFIs and \nonly 14% of funding for small MFIs come through commercial bank borrowing). Interest rates also \nincrease the smaller the size of the MFIs.5 In addition, MFIs across the region have started to \nbroaden  their  product  offerings  to  include,  for  example,  loans  for  incremental  housing \nimprovements. These types of products are typically delivered through an individual loan product \nand have longer loan terms. This is a clear shift from the group lending methodology historically \nused in countries and a clear sign of maturing clients. MFIs in Bangladesh have over time \ndeveloped new products and upgraded skills of employees to deliver these successfully. In India, \nADB is working with selected MFIs to improve responsible finance practices and \u2013 among others \n- risk management practices, including field operations.  During the expansion to other countries, \nfor example Myanmar and Sri Lanka, strengths and weaknesses of MFIs will be assessed \ntogether with the PFIs during the due diligence process.  Expansion of the program needs to be \nfacilitated through either domestic commercial banks or other types of PFIs that have established \nmicrofinance lending experience.  \n \n5.  The transaction cluster technical assistance (TA) will support the MFP major change in \nscope with funds required to develop new guarantee and risk participation products, conduct due \ndiligence and financial analysis of potential new PFIs,6 expand to new countries and facilitate \ndelivery of knowledge products. The design and monitoring framework of the additional financing \nand major change in scope for the MFP covers activities to be supported by the TA. \n \nB.  Justification for Cluster Modality \n \n6.  There are no technical assistance funds attached to the program that provide for these \nnew activities. Therefore, a separate transaction TA is proposed. The TA adopts a cluster modality \nfor four reasons: (i) it provides an opportunity to develop new guarantee and risk participation \nproducts and conduct due diligence and financial analysis over a longer period of time without \ntying-up the full amount of projected TA resource requirements at the onset, (ii) the TA can be \nmore flexible and responsive to the needs of the microfinance sector in ADB developing member \ncountries, (iii) it allows a \u201crepeat engagement\u201d with new PFIs for identified weaknesses,7 and (iv) \nis more efficient than processing individual standalone TAs each year.

During PFI annual review processes progress will then also be reviewed. \n ", "3 \nand guarantee experts, financial analysts and knowledge experts will be engaged to complement \nMFP staffing.  \n \n7.  The proposed TA is designed to support (i) the identification, evaluation and preparation \nof potential new PFIs and MFIs to be accredited under the MFP; (ii) monitoring of portfolio; (iii) \nidentification, evaluation, structuring and preparation of capital market instruments and other \nguarantee/risk participation products to be guaranteed under the MFP; (iv) capacity building for \nPFIs and MFIs, as needed; and (v) disseminating sector information and other knowledge \nproducts to a broader audience. \n \n8.  The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 which focuses on finance sector development \nas one of its five core specializations.8 Poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth is one of \nthe 10 strategic priorities of ADB set forth in the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.9 In its approach \nto inclusive economic growth, ADB will emphasize inclusive finance by improving and expanding \naccess to finance for low-income population and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. The \nexpansion of access to finance for poor women supports ADB\u2019s Gender Equality and Women\u2019s \nEmpowerment Operational Plan, 2013-2020.10 Inclusive finance is also one of the three pillars of \nADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Operational  Plan  which  was  re-affirmed  in  its  2016  review.11 One \ncomponent of PSOD\u2019s strategic focus is to mobilize third-party support via credit enhancement \nproducts and risk transfer agreements. The TA will support the program to facilitate this through \nencouraging private sector contribution to financing of MFIs.  \n \nC.  Outcome and Outputs \n \n9.  Overall outcome. The TA cluster will have the following overall outcome: sustainable \nfinancial inclusion increased. Through a combination of funding instruments, partners will receive \nmore financing for lending to the target population, and PFIs will be more comfortable to lend \ndirectly to this market segment. Each TA subproject will generally deliver all or some of the \nfollowing outputs, as to be specified by each transaction TA subproject proposal. \n \n10.   Output 1: Identification, evaluation and preparation of potential new PFIs and MFIs to be \naccredited under the MFP, including capacity building as needed.  \n \n11.  Output  2:  Identification,  evaluation,  structuring  and  preparation  of  capital  market \ninstruments and other guarantee/risk participation products to be guaranteed under the MFP.  \n \n12.  Output 3: Disseminating sector information and other knowledge products to a broader \naudience. \n \nD.  Cost and Indicative Financing \n13.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost up to $2.0 million which will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6 ($1.0 million) and TASF-Other ($1.0 \nmillion)). The first subproject is expected to cost $500,000 (TASF-6) and financing of subsequent \nsubprojects is subject to availability of TA funds. The funds will cover remuneration, travel, and \nper  diem for  international  consultants;  conference  related  expenditures;  and miscellaneous \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2014.
