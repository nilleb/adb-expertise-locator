INTRODUCTION \n1.  The members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)1 are committed \nto  regional  economic  integration.  Foremost,  they  are  committed  to  the  realization  of  the \nASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by 2015. In an important step toward achieving this goal, \nASEAN leaders issued the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity (MPAC) in 2010 to promote \ninfrastructure  development  and  connectivity.  As  intraregional  trade  and  investment  flows \nincrease, the region's infrastructure needs to keep pace. This is based on a clear recognition \nthat, to better connect the regional market of 600 million people spread across 10 different \ncountries, an infrastructure development-driven connectivity is key. In addition, the regional \nand subregional sector analyses have confirmed the importance of maintaining economic \ncorridor connectivity in the drive to realize the AEC. \n \n2.  ASEAN and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have been collaborating on various \ninitiatives required to support the implementation of the MPAC. An important one is the recent \nestablishment of the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund (AIF).2 The AIF (with mandatory cofinancing \nfrom  ADB)  can  provide  financing  for  key  infrastructure  projects  to  promote  connectivity. \nHowever, even with the AIF, additional support is needed to ensure that the priority projects \nare properly screened and made viable for private sector participation.3 Given the high overall \nfinancing requirements (estimated to be around $60 billion per year for ASEAN) and the \nlimited supply of financing, projects need to be prioritized based on their expected impact and \nviability. To assist in this task, the regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) \nhas  been  designed  in  consultation  with  ASEAN  members.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.4 \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Need for project processing and development. Given the large infrastructure needs \nin the region, there is no dearth of projects, including those that foster connectivity. However, \nthe region as a whole has been less successful in making those projects bankable enough to be \nable to attract funded risk participation from the private sector.5 Thus, while the region is \nbecoming  more  integrated  and  steady  progress  has  been  made  on  various  facets  of \nconnectivity, significant work is required to screen projects prior to their preparation to maximize \ntheir chances of securing private sector participation. Sequentially, the following tasks need to \nbe undertaken in a systematic manner: \n \n                                                \n1  ASEAN has the following members: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The ASEAN region also \nreceives  support  from  three  key  subregional  programs:  (i)  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion;  (ii)  the  Brunei \nDarussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines  East  ASEAN  Growth  Area,  and  (iii)  the  Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013\nThailand Growth Triangle. \n2  ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Equity Contribution \nand Administration of ASEAN Infrastructure Fund. Manila (16 September). The AIF is established by ASEAN \nmember  countries  (except  Myanmar)  and  ADB  to  mobilize  financial  resources  to  support  infrastructure \ndevelopment in the region. The shareholders\u2019 agreement was signed on 24 September 2011 in Washington, DC. \nAs of 15 November 2012, the AIF is considered to be operational, and will begin to lend around $300 million per \nyear, starting in 2013.   \n3  The AIF is administered by ADB, and ADB is responsible for all aspects of its operations, including project pipeline \nformulation, project preparation, and implementation. In the first 5 years of operations, the AIF can only provide \nfinancing for sovereign projects. However, it can also provide financing for the public portion of public\u2013private \npartnership (PPP) projects. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 September 2012. \n5  The financing challenges are discussed in greater detail in the AIF report cited in footnote 2. \n ", "2   \n(i)  A set of robust screening criteria needs to be developed to assess prospects for \n(a) the public\u2013private partnership (PPP) modality (with funded risk participation6 \nby the private sector) and (b) the fostering of regional connectivity. \n(ii)  The projects that meet the criteria need to be identified, then screened and \nprioritized for further development. \n(iii)  Based on the project screening studies, detailed structuring plans need to be \nprepared, focusing on technical, financial, legal, and procurement aspects. \n(iv)  Preliminary investment and financing plans need to be prepared based on initial \nrisk assessment and likely sources of financing, including the AIF. \n(v)  Information memoranda need to be produced that highlight the prospects for \nprivate investors and indicate the type and quantum of public sector support.7 \n \n4.  While  the  MPAC  and  other  plans8  have  defined  priority  project  concepts  to  foster \nconnectivity, there is a need to develop a viable project pipeline, which is based on a systematic \napproach for initial due diligence. In addition, the screening of the projects should ascertain \nwhether they could be financed by such new initiatives as the AIF or by private investments \nthrough the PPP modality. Specifically, the following tasks are required:  \n \n(i)  Although the AIF is designed to help mobilize public and private resources for \ninfrastructure financing, specific support is required for project screening. This is \nbecause, while the AIF will have ADB cofinancing for all projects, the project \nscope and other details need to be consistent with AIF design and objectives. To \nthe  extent  possible,  the  effort  should  focus  on  the  key  strategic  projects  to \npromote connectivity, including those specified in the MPAC. \n(ii)  While  ADB  and  the  AIF  can  continue  to  provide  financing  to  governments, \nadditional measures are needed to  boost private sector participation for key \nregional infrastructure development.9 Even as the region has been active in \nfostering private participation in infrastructure nationally, a mechanism is required \nto catalyze additional private investments into projects that promote regional \nconnectivity. Since ADB has various public sector projects that lend themselves \nto PPP, for those with regional impact, ADB and the AIF can finance the public \nportion while helping structure the portion that is to be financed privately. \n \n                                                \n6  This distinction is critical to classify projects according to various forms of private sector engagement, from \nmanagement contract to leasing to a proper concession. The nature and prospects will vary across the various \ninfrastructure sectors and countries. \n7  Depending on the risk management frameworks in the country concerned, the team involved in screening needs to \nliaise closely with the authorities concerned to understand the criteria for determining public support for projects. \n8  This includes the implementation blueprints for the Brunei Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines East \nASEAN Growth Area and the Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand Growth Triangle, endorsed at their respective senior \nofficials summits in April 2012. The Greater Mekong Subregion leaders have also endorsed the 2012\u20132022 \nGreater Mekong Subregion Strategic Framework, which focuses on investment projects that promote economic \ncorridors, urban development, better transport and trade facilitation, and greater competitiveness. \n9  According to the World Bank\u2019s database on private participation in infrastructure, the less-developed ASEAN \nmembers (Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam) have received only around \n1% of the world\u2019s total private investments during the 1990-2010 period (around $1 billion per year). Furthermore, \nsince the capital market is mostly underdeveloped in the region, many ASEAN countries continue to rely on short-\nterm bank loans for infrastructure financing. \n ", "  3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The overall impact of the TA is greater connectivity in the ASEAN region. While there are \nmany  facets  to  connectivity,  this  TA  will  concentrate  on  the  region\u2019s  physical  connectivity \nthrough infrastructure development. The TA will further aim to leverage on existing ASEAN-led \ninitiatives (such as the AIF), and step up efforts to encourage private sector involvement through \npromoting PPP development. \n \n6.  The outcome of the TA is increased investments from both public and private sectors \ninto ASEAN\u2019s physical connectivity. The TA will develop a set of screening mechanisms to \n(i) determine the most viable projects with regional connectivity impact to be financed by ADB \nand the AIF, and (ii) catalyze private sector investments by developing a project structuring \nfacility10 for regional PPP projects. For the PPP structuring, the targeted projects will be those \nincluded in the ADB pipeline, to be financed by ADB and the AIF. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  and  monitored  through  regular  reports,  dissemination \nactivities  and  workshops,  and  feedback  obtained  through  periodic  consultations  with \nstakeholders. A series of smaller seminars can also be held in coordination with government \nagencies and other ADB departments (including the Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment). Available updates, outputs, or observations will be discussed. The TA will deliver \nthe following main outputs: \n \n(i)  Component 1: Project pipeline screening. In 2011, ADB approved the TA for \nthe Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity Implementation.11 Among its various \ncomponents,  that  TA  supports  the  development  of  a  pipeline  of  regional \nconnectivity projects. Building from those efforts, and based on the initial project \npipeline for the AIF, this TA will engage in more in-depth project screening in \ncoordination with the relevant sector divisions within the ADB Southeast Asia \nDepartment to further advance project financing. This component will carry out \nthe  tasks  outlined  in  para.  3,  i.e.,  based  on  a  need  to  develop  a  sound \ninfrastructure project pipeline with a regional scope to promote connectivity. The \nscreened and selected projects should be financed by ADB and the AIF. \n(ii)  Component 2: Regional PPP structuring facility. In 2011, ADB was requested \nby the ASEAN Working Committee on Capital Market Development to study \nvarious options for PPP and capital market instruments for project financing. \nAccordingly,  ADB\u2019s  TA  for  the  Promotion  of  Capital  Market  Instruments  for \nInfrastructure Financing in the ASEAN was  undertaken to determine, among \nothers, the necessity of and the processes involved in the development of a \nproject  structuring  facility  focusing  on  the  key  infrastructure  projects  in  the \nASEAN region. 12 Based on the study, ADB has undertaken consultations with \nSingapore (as a shareholder of the AIF seeking to promote PPP through AIF \n                                                \n10 This is commonly described as a \u201cproject development facility\u201d. For this TA, however, it is called \u201cproject structuring \nfacility\u201d. This distinction is made since the aim is to fully structure the projects for PPP financing. \n11 ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance for the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity Implementation. Manila (TA 8040-\nREG, approved on 15 December). \n12 ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance for the Promotion of Capital Market Instruments for Infrastructure Financing in \nthe ASEAN. Manila (TA 7969-REG, approved on 6 December). \n ", "4   \nsupport, and as the chair of the ASEAN Working Committee on Capital Market \nDevelopment) to support the facility.13 As such a facility will require considerable \nresources, ADB and the Government of Singapore have formulated a 3-year \nfinancing  plan  for  the  facility.  ADB  will  seek  additional  cofinanciers  and/or \npartners to support this initiative in the future (footnote 12). \n \n8.  The main link between the two components is as follows. The TA will initiate a project \nscreening process to determine the most viable projects for further processing and project \npreparation. For those that are suitable for private financing (under the PPP modality), the \nfacility will support the structuring work. Overall, the facility is designed to target PPP projects in \nthe ADB project pipeline for which the public portion could be financed by ADB and the AIF; at \nthe same time, the facility will catalyze private investments through its structuring work. In \naddition, the facility will need to coordinate with, and take into account the lessons learned from, \nthe national facilities that already exist in the Southeast Asia region, such as those in Indonesia, \nthe Philippines, and Viet Nam. For more effective use of capital market instruments, the facility \ncould seek synergy with the existing institutions and initiatives, such as the Credit Guarantee \nInvestment Facility.14 \n \n9.  The proposed facility will be financed by both ADB and Singapore. A steering committee \nmade up of Singaporean and ADB officials will oversee it.15 ADB will endeavor to find suitable \nprojects for the facility, i.e., those that (i) have sufficient size for PPP structuring, (ii) have \nsubstantial impact on the region, and (iii) can be financed by ADB and the AIF. After the \nrecommendation from ADB, the facility can conduct short screening studies to determine the \nmost suitable projects (through the TA\u2019s component 1). Then, the PPP structuring work will \nbegin for a given project; it is envisioned that it will take 2\u20133 years to complete the structuring. \n \n10.  Based on the above design and expected outputs, the major assumptions for the TA are: \n(i) continued commitment for narrowing the development gap is a shared goal of all ASEAN \ndeveloping member countries, (ii) there is sustained private sector interest in infrastructure \ndevelopment  in  ASEAN,  and  (iii)  ASEAN-wide  objectives  continue  to  be  reflected  in  and \nconsistent with national plans of ASEAN developing member countries. Major risks are: (i) a \nprolonged economic downturn could lead to a policy shift toward domestic economic concerns, \n(ii) policy shifts result in reluctance of the relevant agencies to share undertakings in specific \nareas for a sustained period of time, and (iii) Asia\u2019s private sector participation is adversely \naffected by economic conditions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The resource support from Singapore (as \n                                                \n13 The facility (tentatively called the ASEAN Infrastructure Center of Excellence) will be supported by ADB through \nthis TA and other resource allocation. This does not require an equity investment from ADB. The support of the \nGovernment of Singapore for the facility will be provided on an untied, parallel, and equal basis. The commitment \nof the Government of Singapore will be around $4.5 million for 3 years (or $1.5 million per year). Based on the \nprogress and requirements, ADB and the Government of Singapore could seek additional financial support for the \nproposed facility from other development partners. \n14 Further information on the Credit Guarantee Investment Facility may be obtained from:  \nhttp://www.adb.org/site/funds/funds/credit-guarantee-and-investment-facility \n15 In August 2012, the ADB Management approved the formation of an interdepartmental team to work on the facility. \nIt  consists  of  ADB\u2019s  Southeast  Asia  Department  (PPP  Unit  and  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operation \nCoordination  Division)  and  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  (Sustainable  Infrastructure \nDivision), and the PPP community of practice (as advisor). \n ", "  5 \nexplained above) will be undertaken in parallel.16 The TA is expected to undertake Component \n1 (which is estimated to be around $150,000), while Component 2 will be undertaken with \nSingapore. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  ADB\u2014through  its  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations  Coordination  Division,  the \nSoutheast Asia Department as a focal point, and with participation from other ADB departments \n(including the Regional and Sustainable Development Department)\u2014will implement the TA over \n36 months, from January 2013 to January 2016. The Regional Cooperation and Operations \nCoordination Division will coordinate with the Southeast Asia Department's sector divisions and \nresident missions on TA findings. ADB will coordinate with ASEAN and its initiatives, including \nthe AIF. As the TA involves PPP structuring, it will also seek support and advice from the ADB \ncommunity of practice on PPP. When the TA is to engage in specific, in-country activities, \nconcurrence from the respective government should be sought before starting those activities. \nIn  addition,  a  steering  committee  consisting  of  ADB  and  Government  of  Singapore  staff \nmembers will be established to operate the proposed project structuring facility. \n \n13.  A group of individual consultants (and firms as appropriate)17 will provide the advisory, \ntechnical,  and  administrative  support  services.  It  is  estimated  that  36  person-months  of \ninternational and 36 person-months of national consulting services are required for the TA. Due \nto the diverse skills requirements, consultants will be engaged on an individual basis for the \ncomponent  on  project  pipeline  screening,  and  through  a  firm  for  the  component  on  PPP \nstructuring. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  As  required,  ADB  staff  members  will \nparticipate as resource persons where applicable. \n \n14.  The purchase of equipment (computer hardware and software) will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and in \ncoordination  with  the  ADB  Office  of  Information  Systems  and  Technology,  and  Office  of \nAdministrative Services, where applicable. Upon TA completion, any procured equipment will be \nturned  over  to  the  developing  member  countries\u2019  participating  government  agencies  in \naccordance with the relevant ADB's guidelines. Disbursements under the TA will be made in \naccordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000 on a grant basis \nfor the Supporting Regional Project Development for Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n \nConnectivity, and hereby reports this action to the Board.\n                                                \n16 Accordingly, it is envisioned that a formal letter of agreement or memorandum of understanding will be signed with \nSingapore to outline the collaboration arrangement. \n17 The quality-based selection process will be used. The quality-based selection process has been recommended \ndue to the complex nature of structuring PPP projects. Other methods of recruitment are to be tailored for this TA in \nconsultation with the relevant departments in ADB. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nGreater connectivity  Growth in trade and  Reports from ASEAN  Continued commitment to \nin the ASEAN region  investment opportunities  and other development  narrowing the \nwithin the ASEAN region  partners  development gap is a \nsupported by sound    shared goal of all ASEAN \ninfrastructure     developing member \n    countries. \nBaseline: Intraregional  Government reports   \ntrade share at 25.9%  Sustained private sector \n(2011) and intraregional  interest in infrastructure \ncumulative foreign direct  development in ASEAN \ninvestment inflows at   \n$49.6 billion (2009)  Risk \nProlonged economic \ndownturn could lead to a \npolicy shift toward \ndomestic economic \nconcerns. \nOutcome      Assumption \nIncreased  Synergies between various  Reports from ASEAN  ASEAN-wide objectives \ninvestments from  key initiatives (and ASEAN  and other development  continue to be reflected in \nboth public and  member countries) as well  partners   and consistent with \nprivate sectors into  as the private sector are    national plans of ASEAN \nASEAN physical  fostered:  Government reports  member countries. \nconnectivity   (i)  AIF to contain PPP     \nprojects in its pipeline  ADB reports  Risk \nby 2015  Policy shifts result in \n(2012 baseline: 0)  reluctance of the relevant \n(ii)  At least 1\u20132 PPP  agencies to be involved in \nprojects are structured  specific undertakings for \nby the end of 2014  a sustained period of \n(2012 baseline: 0).  time. \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
