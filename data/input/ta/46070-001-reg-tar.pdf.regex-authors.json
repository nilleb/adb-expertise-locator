Upon the request of member countries of the Southeast Asian Ministers of Education \nOrganization  (SEAMEO),  the  SEAMEO  Secretariat  submitted  a  proposal  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for regional technical assistance (TA) to help establish a regional \nplatform  for  high-level  policy  and  strategic  dialogue  on  education  and  human  resource \ndevelopment (HRD) issues in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region.1 \nSEAMEO will offer this regional platform through the establishment of SEAMEO College. Based \non consultations between ADB and SEAMEO, the detailed design and operational plan of \nSEAMEO College was prepared, and endorsed at the 35th SEAMEO High Officials Meeting \nfrom 27 to 29 November 2012, when an ADB consultation mission was fielded to discuss and \nagree on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost estimates and \nfinancing plan, and terms of reference of consultants.2  The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1.3 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ASEAN strives to increase regional connectivity, competitiveness, and community.4 One \nof the purposes of ASEAN is \u201cto develop human resources through cooperation in education \nand life-long learning, and in science and technology, for the strengthening of the ASEAN \nCommunity.\u201d5 ASEAN member countries share a common goal of aligning their education and \ntraining systems to develop their human resources toward an ASEAN Economic Community \n(AEC) in 2015 and beyond. However, ASEAN needs to accelerate activities as stipulated in its \nblueprints, particularly the AEC Blueprint.  \n \n3.  Since 1965, SEAMEO, with its Secretariat and 20 regional centers, has been at the helm \nof regional cooperation in education, science, and culture in Southeast Asia.6 According to the \nASEAN  Education  Ministers  Meeting,  ASEAN\u2019s  cooperation  priorities  in  education  will  be \nundertaken through collaboration with SEAMEO.7 ADB and SEAMEO signed a memorandum of \nunderstanding to facilitate collaboration in the development of regional cooperation programs, \nincluding assistance from ADB to SEAMEO.8 To help achieve the AEC in 2015 and beyond, \nSEAMEO aligned and intensified its initiatives to foster human and intellectual connectivity\u2014an \nessential ingredient for a successful AEC. \n \n4.  SEAMEO College is a high-level policy and strategy forum among education leaders and \npractitioners. It does not involve a physical campus. SEAMEO College has two main functions: \n                                                \n1  SEAMEO is an international and intergovernmental organization established in 1965 to promote cooperation in \neducation, science, and culture in Southeast Asia. It comprises education ministers from 11 member countries: \nBrunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, \nSingapore, Timor-Leste, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The SEAMEO Secretariat is the legal and administrative \nrepresentative of SEAMEO.   \n2  ADB supported the preparation of the SEAMEO College, under R-S-PATA 7957: Regional Technical Assistance to \nSupport to ASEAN Leaders Forum on HRD for an Integrated ASEAN Community ($225,000, approved on \n7 December 2012). See SEAMEO Secretariat. 2012. Design and Operation Plan for the SEAMEO College. \nBangkok.  The SEAMEO College is a flagship program under SEAMEO\u2019s Ten-Year Strategic Plan, 2011\u20132020, \nand was officially launched on 20 March 2013 at the 47th SEAMEO Council Meeting held in Ha Noi, Viet Nam.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 May 2013.  \n4   ASEAN. 2010.

ASEAN Education Ministers Meeting. http://www.asean.org/communities/asean-socio-cultural-community/ \ncategory/overview-24  \n8  ADB and SEAMEO. 2003. Memorandum of Understanding between ADB and SEAMEO (signed on 25 June).  \n ", "2   \n(i) to create a regional platform for education ministers, high-level policy makers, prominent \neducation  practitioners,  and  youth  leaders  to  regularly  convene  policy,  strategic,  and \nmethodological dialogues on ASEAN-wide education and HRD issues; and (ii) through such \ndialogues,  to  bring  about frontier  innovations  in  education  and  HRD  in  ASEAN.  SEAMEO \nCollege, as the only concrete regional education platform to date in Southeast Asia, will help \nmake the ASEAN region more competitive through strengthened capacity of education leaders \nand practitioners. The TA will help identify measures to advance education and HRD elements \nof the AEC Blueprint, and thus respond to the urgent need for assistance in accelerating the \nprocess of building an integrated ASEAN Community by 2015. \n \n5.  Among the ASEAN-wide education and HRD issues, SEAMEO College will focus on \nthree key issues. First, disparities in education and skills attainment between low- and middle-\nincome countries\u2014and among low-income countries such as Cambodia,  the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam\u2014in the ASEAN region need to be addressed. \nSecond, harmonized regional frameworks for common standards in education and training are \nneeded. This will focus on developing (i) mutual recognition of qualifications to facilitate the free \nflow of skilled labor in the region,9 and (ii) a common regional framework for higher education \nharmonization to enable greater student and academic mobility in ASEAN. Third, changing \nlabor demand in ASEAN needs to be tackled with a view to developing a regional labor market.   \n \n6.  These regional issues require innovative solutions, which SEAMEO College aims to \nprovide through the collective efforts of education ministers, high-level policy makers, and \neducation  and  youth  leaders.  In  particular,  innovative  ways  are  needed  for  developing  a \nproductive, competitive, and mobile labor force within the ASEAN members. ADB accords high \npriority to regional cooperation and cross-border collaboration in education to help harmonize \neducation and skills systems and qualifications\u2014thereby facilitating the mobility of students, \nfaculty,  and  labor;  and  strengthening  regional  integration.  By  supporting  the  promotion  of \nregional dialogue and cooperation among ASEAN members and key stakeholders in education \nand HRD, the TA is aligned with the objective of ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Integration \nStrategy.10 It is also in line with ADB\u2019s education operations plan, which stresses the importance \nof ADB support to education, with priorities including support to new and innovative models in \neducation  service  delivery  and  to  regional  cooperation  and  cross-border  collaboration  in \neducation.11 SEAMEO College will link with ADB projects, particularly in higher education and \ntechnical and vocational education and training (TVET), and create synergy or complementarity \nat the regional policy level. The TA will also complement existing HRD programs in the Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS)12 and the Phnom Penh Plan (PPP) for Development Management.13 \n                                                \n \n9 To date, eight mutual recognition arrangements have been identified for the following professional groups: \nengineering  services,  nursing  services,  architectural  services,  surveying,  tourism  professionals,  medical \npractitioners, dental practitioners, and accountancy services. However, there has been little progress so far in \nimplementation, and ASEAN-wide cooperation is required to develop a practical system for comparing and \nrecognizing skills and qualifications.  \n10  ADB. 2006.

Both GMS HRD strategic framework and action plans, 2009\u20132012 and 2013\u2013\n2017, include support to develop a mutual recognition framework. However, the development of such a framework \nunder these plans is limited to a desk study and pilot testing of a GMS recognition framework in a few selected \ntechnical skill areas. The TA will complement the 2009 TA and the GMS HRD strategic framework and action plan, \n2013\u20132017, by extending its scope, coverage, and linkages to ASEAN-wide recognition framework of technical \nskills and qualifications.  \n13 ADB.  2012.

The impact of the TA is regional education and HRD innovations for a more integrated \nASEAN Community. The outcome of the TA is strengthened capacity of education leaders and \npractitioners to address ASEAN-wide education and HRD issues. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will mainly support the delivery of specific capacity building modules and related \nresearch.14 It  will  have  five  outputs:  (i)  knowledge  on  regional  frameworks  for  common \nstandards  in  education  and  HRD  enhanced  and  shared  among  education  policy  makers, \n(ii) regional and country case studies on innovative solutions to ASEAN-wide education and \nHRD issues developed and disseminated, (iii) policy options for learning and innovations for \neducation practitioners and youth leaders identified, (iv) research capacity of SEAMEO College \nenhanced, and (v) institutional linkages of SEAMEO regional centers as integral constituents of \nSEAMEO College strengthened. \n \n9.  Output 1. The TA will support high-profile strategic dialogues among Southeast Asian \neducation ministers, which will be called Strategic Dialogue for Education Ministers (SDEM) \n(module 1).15 The dialogues will be facilitated by internationally well-known eminent persons, \nworld-class educators, or peer ministers of education. SDEM will be conducted once in 2014 \nand once in 2015. Through SDEM, Southeast Asian education ministers will share ideas on \nregional frameworks for common standards in education and HRD.16 \n \n10.  Output 2. The TA will support forward-looking discussions among high-level education \npolicy makers to generate new insights and innovative solutions. The discussions will be called \nHigh Officials Country Case Studies (HOCCS) (module 2), based on regional and country \ncase  studies  of  ASEAN-wide  education  and  HRD  issues,  especially  three  key  issues \n(para. 5). HOCCS will be conducted once in 2013 and 2014. Through HOCCS, new regional \nframeworks for common standards in support of SDEM (module 1) will be developed.  \n  \n11.  Output  3.  The  TA  will  support  forums  on  learning  and  innovations  that  can  be \nconsidered by education practitioners and youth leaders. These will be called the Education \nLeaders\u2019  Innovation  Forum  (module  3)  and  the  Learning  and  Innovation  Forum  for  Youth \nLeaders (module 4). Both forums will be conducted once in 2013 and 2014. Practices and \nexperiences will be gathered and studied with a view to promoting life and 21st century skills; \nnew teaching and learning methods, including the use of new education technologies; ASEAN \ncontent in curricula; and school- and community-based innovations and good practices.  \n \n                                                \nManagement V. Manila (R-CDTA 8225, $1.25 million, approved on 23 November). ADB has supported the PPP since \n2002 as a core program on HRD in the GMS. The PPP aims to develop a cadre of GMS development leaders by \nfocusing on regional cooperation and middle and senior officials (but not ministers and high-level policy makers). The \nregional platform to be provided by SEAMEO College will draw experience from middle-income ASEAN countries, \nand have synergy with the PPP, for example, by joining PPP\u2019s planned programs on labor markets in the GMS.  \n14  While Timor-Leste is not included in the TA scope, SEAMEO may invite participants from Timor-Leste to activities \nrelated to SEAMEO College using SEAMEO\u2019s own resources. Special consideration will be given to Myanmar in \nterms of its participation to capacity building modules and research activities.     \n15 The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction will not finance costs for the venue, travel, and per diem of participants to \nthe SDEM. \n \n16 It is expected that SEAMEO will liaise with the ASEAN Secretariat in adopting regional frameworks for common \nstandards as regional policy agenda at the ASEAN Summit and/or the ASEAN Education Ministers Meeting. \n ", "4   \n12.  Output  4.  The  TA  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  SEAMEO  College  to  undertake \nresearch in support of outputs 1\u20133. The topics will include (i) a review of best practices of \ninnovative approaches in education and HRD within and outside the region, which can be \nadapted to Southeast Asia; (ii) mutual recognition and harmonization frameworks with common \nstandards  in  TVET  and  higher  education;  (iii) supply  and  demand  forecasting  of  human \nresources in ASEAN; and (iv) post-Education for All framework and agenda beyond 2015. The \nTA  will  strengthen  the  research  network  among  SEAMEO  regional  centers  and  between \nSEAMEO regional centers and other regional research institutes and leading universities.  \n \n13.  Output  5. The TA  will  strengthen  linkages  among  SEAMEO  regional  centers. This \noutput  will  enable  SEAMEO  regional  centers  to  become  integral  constituents  of  SEAMEO \nCollege. Strengthening e-connectivity across SEAMEO regional centers will promote online \nwork collaboration among SEAMEO regional centers through online meetings and conferences. \nSEAMEO regional centers will also organize six communities of practice with their knowledge \nsharing and learning websites. This will help build a network for research and development of \neducation innovations in Southeast Asia. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,650,000, of which $1,400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. SEAMEO will provide counterpart support in the form of \noffice accommodation, remuneration of counterpart staff, costs of venue and travel and per \ndiem of participants to SDEM (module 1), utilities, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n15.  The SEAMEO Secretariat in Bangkok will be the executing agency, and eight SEAMEO \nregional centers will be implementing agencies.17 As the legal and administrative representative \nof SEAMEO, the Secretariat will be responsible for overall TA implementation. The TA will be \nthe first ASEAN-wide TA in the education and training sector directly involving ministers in \ncharge of education and/or TVET, and high-level policy makers. SEAMEO has established its \nnetwork and accumulated experience in regional cooperation in Southeast Asia, and has the \nmandate and capacity to influence education leaders and practitioners on regional education, \nand HRD initiatives. In addition to its record as an effective executing agency under previous \nregional TA (footnote 17), the SEAMEO Secretariat is a suitable executing agency for the \nfollowing reasons: (i) SEAMEO is impartial and neutral, and can offer equal treatment to its \nmember countries; (ii) SEAMEO has good communication channels with the countries involved \nin the TA; (iii) SEAMEO has successfully managed international and national consultants under \nADB  TA  (footnote 2);  (iv)  all  SEAMEO  member  countries  endorsed  the  proposed \nimplementation arrangements at the 35th SEAMEO High Official Meeting; and (v) the 47th \nSEAMEO Council Meeting approved the establishment of SEAMEO College. ADB will provide \noverall policy advice to SEAMEO on the management and implementation of SEAMEO College, \nand  engage  in  policy  dialogue  with  education  ministers  and  high-level  policy  makers  by \nparticipating in selected activities under the TA. The recruitment of consultants, procurement of \nequipment, and disbursement will remain with ADB.  \n                                                \n17 The SEAMEO Secretariat was the executing agency and selected SEAMEO regional centers were the implementing \nagencies for ADB. 2003.

SEAMEO has executed and implemented a number of activities financed by contributions from SEAMEO \nmember countries and development partners, including ADB and the World Bank. \n ", "  5 \n16.  The advisory board\u2014comprising prominent scholars and professionals, representatives \nfrom the private sector, the director of the SEAMEO Secretariat, and responsible ADB staff such \nas a representative from the concerned division\u2014will serve as a project steering committee, and \nguide  implementation  of  the  TA  at  the  policy  level.  The  project  management  committee, \ncomprising  selected  SEAMEO  Secretariat  and  SEAMEO  regional  center  staff,  will  provide \noversight of TA implementation. The project management office, which is equivalent to a project \nimplementation unit and is headed by a project manager and staffed by project officers, will \nimplement the day-to-day activities of the TA and report to the project management committee. \nThe project management office will be located on the premises of the SEAMEO Secretariat. The \nstructure and implementation arrangements are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n17.  Consulting services under the TA will flexibly respond to requests of the governments of \nSEAMEO member countries. About 108 person-months of international and national consultants \nwill be recruited by ADB. Consultants will require highly specialized knowledge on ASEAN-wide \neducation and HRD issues, and extensive networks with education ministers, high-level policy \nmakers,  education  administrators  and  practitioners,  and  youth  leaders  in  ASEAN member \ncountries. A firm is unlikely to gather such specialized expertise and extensive networks in a \nsingle team. Consultants will be recruited on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). About 22 resource \npersons will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants, including (i) internationally well-known eminent persons such as representatives \nfrom the private sector to serve as speakers during capacity building modules of SEAMEO \nCollege; (ii) prominent scholars, professionals, and representatives from the private sector who \nwill provide specific inputs to the advisory board; (iii) regional experts who will provide specific \ninputs to the project management committee; and (iv) experts on education policy research who \nwill mainly prepare and deliver workshops on education policy research. \n \n18.  For the workshops, training, seminars, conferences, and surveys  under the TA, an \nadvance payment facility will be established at the executing agency. Disbursement under the \nTA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time). The eligibility or ineligibility of expenditures will be guided by \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction policies and guidelines for TA.18 Office equipment under the \nTA will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from \ntime to time), and on completion of the TA, the SEAMEO Secretariat will retain all equipment to \nbe used in operating SEAMEO College. It is expected that the TA will commence in July 2013 \nand be completed in June 2015. The outline terms of reference for the SEAMEO Secretariat, \nSEAMEO regional centers, and consultants are in Appendix 3. ADB will obtain a no-objection \nfrom the developing member country government before starting any activity financed under this \nTA in the territory of that country. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,400,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Support for a Regional Platform on \nInnovations in Education and Human Resources Development for Competitiveness towards an \nIntegrated ASEAN Community, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n18 ADB.
