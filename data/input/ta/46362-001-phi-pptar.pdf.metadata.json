Project preparatory technical assistance is required to (i) assess technical feasibility, and \nfinancial and economic viability of proposed investments; (ii) define the scope of work and \nphasing of the investment; and (iii) prepare all documents required for ADB and governments \napproval of the loan. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  Preliminary structural, hydraulic and geological assessments. Review of availability \nand quality of available data, though desk study. In case of missing data, surveys will be carried \nout to collect data. In case of missing data that does affect the rehabilitation of the remaining \naqueducts, the consultants will formulate terms of reference (TOR) for additional surveys. The \nconsultants will establish the priority investment plan.  \n \n3.  Project preparation reports and feasibility studies for the Project in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for  rehabilitation  of  the  priority  works. The feasibility  study \nincludes  a  review  of  alternative  construction  methods,  materials,  etc  to  be  used  for  the \nrehabilitation, followed  by  a  selection  of most  appropriate  method  and/or  materials. These \ncriteria  will  include,  but  is  not  limited  to,  technical,  financial  (life  cycle  costing),  social \n(affordability) and environmental (climate resilience) issues. The feasibility study will include \nfinancial and economic analysis of the proposed investment. \n \n4.  Supporting  studies  and  reports.  These  include:  (i)  socio-economic  impact \nassessment; (ii)  initial environmental  examination; (iii)  safeguard reviews,  if  applicable;  (iv) \nfinancial management capacity assessment of Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System; \nand  (v)  procurement  capacity  assessment  of  MWSS.  The  resulting  reports  should  include \nrecommendations for remedial measures and TORs for capacity development.  \n \n5.  Water  safety,  risk  and  asset  management  plan.  The  plan  should  identify  non-\nstructural (such as organization set up, preparation of asset register, capacity development, real \ntime monitoring system, etc) and structural measures (re-configuration and/or interconnection of \naqueducts and/or settling basins, modification of intakes, construction of additional tunnel, etc). \nThe structural modeling of the complete transmission system, to simulate severe earthquake \nscenarios is part of the risk management.  \n \n6.  Overall implementation plan. This plan follows ADB\u2019s project administration manual \ntemplate, and includes description of the scope of the works, the implementation arrangements, \nthe cost estimates and the procurement plan. \n   \n ", "  Appendix 4  11 \n7.
