It \nwill help restore essential public services, rebuild infrastructure, and \nrevive  economic  activity  through  livelihood  support.  The  ETESP  is \nbased on the findings of the joint damage and loss assessment, and \nthe emerging disaster management, rehabilitation, and reconstruction \n(DMRR) strategy for Aceh and North Sumatra, jointly prepared by the \nGovernment  of  Indonesia  and  the  donor  community,  with  active \nparticipation of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Consultations with \ncommunities and nongovernment organizations have been undertaken, \nand will be intensified in the process of formulating and implementing \nsubprojects under the ETESP. In view of the scale, complexity, and \nnature  of  the  disaster,  the  ETESP  adopts  a  two-phase approach, \nfocusing  first  on  providing  development  support  to  less-affected \nregions,  along  with  launching  assessments  in  the  most-affected \nregions.  Phase two involves subproject implementation after the spatial \nplanning  and  safeguard  issues  are  resolved.  The  ETESP  will \ncomplement emergency assistance work launched by ADB through the \nreprogramming  of  11  ongoing  projects  and  adding  an  Aceh-North \nSumatra component to the proposed Community Water Services and \nHealth Project.  \n   \nRationale  Among  the  affected  countries,  the  impact  of  the  December  2004 \nearthquake and tsunami was the most vicious in Indonesia, as evident \nfrom the loss of 126,000 lives, 94,470 people missing, and 412,438 \ninternally displaced. About 20% of the population of Aceh province is ", "ii   \nhomeless today.   In  North Sumatra, the death toll was about 215.  \nAbout 20% of the area of Nias Islands was damaged. Besides the \ngrave tragedy and trauma, the disaster resulted in complete destruction \nof most infrastructure along the coastlines, leading to a total collapse of \npublic  services,  major  loss  of  private  property,  and  virtual  loss  of \nlivelihood.  \n \nIn the inland, the earthquake caused substantive damage to buildings \nand infrastructure. The tsunami swept debris and seawater up to 5 \nkilometers inland, crushing and damaging buildings, roads, bridges, \ntelecommunications,  water  and  electricity  systems,  fisheries \ninfrastructure, crops, fuel outlets, and food warehouses. Those who \nsurvived the disaster suffer from tremendous trauma because of loss of \nfamilies and relatives, as well as loss of livelihood and access to basic \nshelter  and  services.  The  internally  displaced  people,  who  have \nrelocated to other communities or temporary camps and shelters, have \nbrought  on  challenges  and  distress  to  the  already  poor  and \noverstretched  community  and  public  services.  Most  of  the  public \ninfrastructure along the western coast must be rehabilitated or rebuilt, \nwhile  the  human  and  social  dimensions  of  the  disaster  call  for \nconcerted efforts to revive lives and livelihoods, and resurrect entire \ncommunities. \n \nThe provincial and local governments, which had already low budgets \nand weak delivery capacity due to years of civil conflict, have lost \noffices and staff. Restoring normalcy is key to helping people get over \ntheir  trauma,  but  the  cost  and  challenges  of  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction are phenomenal. The damages and losses, estimated at \n$4.7 billion, are the largest requirement among the affected regions in \nAsia. During the development partner meeting in January 2005, donors \npledged $1.7 billion to meet part of these requirements. ADB\u2019s support \nwill help meet the immediate requirements based on the joint damage \nand loss assessment and the DMRR strategy. \n   \nObjectives  The overall goal of the ETESP is to help rebuild the affected regions \nand support their economic revival to meet the Millennium Development \nGoals. Its purpose is to (i) facilitate economic revival in the affected \nregions by restoring livelihoods; and (ii) alleviate constraints due to the \nlack of adequate public goods and facilities by restoring essential public \nservices and rebuilding infrastructure. \n \nTo meet the critical DMRR needs in a flexible manner, the ETESP is \ndesigned as a multisector project facility that follows the sector loan \napproach. It consists of five principal sector groupings: \n \n(i)  Livelihood restoration. Rehabilitate the agriculture and \nfisheries  sectors,  the  mainstay  of  a  majority  of  the \nAcehnese, and revive micro and small enterprises. \n \n(ii)  Social services provision.  Rehabilitate and reconstruct \nhealth  and  education  facilities,  and  support  skills ", "  iii \ndevelopment of the affected population through vocational \ntraining. \n \n(iii)  Community infrastructure. Provide water and sanitation \nfacilities, rebuild irrigation infrastructure, and rehabilitate \nand reconstruct the damaged and lost housing stock within \nan integrated community development framework. \n \n(iv)  Physical infrastructure. Rebuild the damaged roads and \nbridges,  restore  power  supply,  support  sound  spatial \nplanning,  and  strengthen  environmental  management \nsystems. \n \n(v)  Fiduciary  governance.  Ensure  sound  oversight  of  the \nutilization  of  donor  funds  in  the  DMRR  process,  and \nfacilitate effective delivery of ETESP assistance. \n   \nCost Estimates   The total cost of the ETESP is estimated at $321.5 million equivalent.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A grant of $290.0 million from the Asian Tsunami Fund resources of the \nADB  will  be  provided  to  finance  the  ETESP.  In  addition,  the \nNetherlands  Government  will  provide  $3.5 million  for the fiduciary \noversight  support  component  of  the  ETESP.  The  Government  of \nIndonesia  will finance the remaining $28.0 million equivalent of the \ncosts covering local taxes and other regular administrative costs.  \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The  Government  is  establishing  an  Aceh  Reconstruction \nArrangements  Implementation Coordination Board (BKP) to coordinate and implement \nDMRR. BKP  will provide an interface between the central and local \ngovernments and ensure effective involvement of the Acehnese people. \nBKP  will  comprise  a  steering  board,  supervisory  board,  and  an \nimplementation  coordination  board.  The  steering  board  will  include \nselected  ministers,  the  governor  of  Aceh,  the  governor  of  north \nSumatra,  heads  of  affected  districts,  academics,  community \nrepresentatives  and  religious  leaders.  It  will  provide  inputs  and \nrecommendations in formulating, planning and implementing the DMRR \nprocess, and submit reports to the President of Indonesia once every \nfour months. The supervisory board will comprise  representatives of \ncivil  society,  local  universities,  local  media,  nongovernment \norganizations, and donors (bilateral and multilateral). It will oversee the \nactivities of the BKP, receive and follow up on complaints from the \npublic, and coordinate independent audits on the functioning of the \nBKP.  The  implementation  board,  comprising  the  head  of  BKP,  its \nsecretary,  and  deputies  of  BKP\u2019s  operational  departments,  will \nformulate operational policies, implement projects in coordination with \nother  relevant  Government  institutions,  and  ensure  overall  sound \nfiduciary governance in the utilization of donor support and other public \nfunds in the DMRR process. \n ", "iv   \nOnce established, the BKP will be the Executing Agency. In the interim, \nBAPPENAS will function as the Executing Agency and once BKP is \nestablished the role and responsibilities of the Executing Agency will be \ntransferred  from  BAPPENAS  to  BKP.  BKP  will be responsible for \noverall  management  and  coordination  of  ETESP  and  its \nimplementation, in close collaboration with the line ministries. For the \nday-to-day  project  management,  a  dedicated,  centralized  project \nmanagement office will be established within BKP, with staffing and \nother support provided by the ETESP. The project management office \nwill  review  and  appraise  subprojects  for  BKP\u2019s consideration, and \nensure overall governance and fiduciary controls on the utilization of \nETESP funds. The design of subprojects and their implementation will \nbe  under  the  responsibility  of  the  respective  line  ministries,  in \ncollaboration with local governments.  \n \nThe Extended Mission of Sumatra, being established by ADB, will be \nresponsible for managing, administering, and implementing the ETESP. \nLocated in Medan with an office in Banda Aceh, the Mission will work \nclosely  with  BKP;  project  management  office;  and  the  central, \nprovincial,  and  local  governments  to  structure  and  implement  the \nsubprojects. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Aceh-North Sumatra Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Implementation \nCoordination  Board  (BKP)  (see  notes  under  Implementation \nArrangements) \n   \nProcurement  Given the emergency DMRR needs, procurement of goods, services, \nand works will be carried out in a manner consistent with the simplified \nand  expedient  procedures  permitted  under  the  ADB  Disaster  and \nEmergency Assistance Policy and ADB Guidelines for Procurement, in \ngeneral. ADB procedures for providing reconstruction assistance after \ndisasters allow maximum flexibility, so that project activities can start \npromptly. National procurement will be the preferred mode for all civil \nworks  because  of  the  relatively  short  implementation  period,  the \ngenerally small size of contract packages, and the wide geographic \nspread of the project sites. Community participation in procurement will \nbe encouraged, and local goods and services will be given priority to \nencourage economic revival in the affected regions. \n   \nConsulting Services  All  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB,  in  consultation  with  the \nGovernment,  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants. Simplified consultant selection \nprocedures, including direct selection and shorter evaluation periods, \nwill be followed in line with the flexibility provided under ADB\u2019s Disaster \nand Emergency Assistance Policy. \n   \nMultidonor Trust  The Government is coordinating the establishment of a multidonor trust \nFund  fund  (MDTF),  which  is  expected  to  attract  contributions  of  several \ndonors.  MDTF is a vehicle to pool bilateral resources in order to \nchannel  these  through  the  budget  to  ensure  a  systematic  and ", "  v\ncoordinated approach to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the \naffected regions. It is proposed that ADB contribute $10 million from the \nAsian Tsunami Fund to the MDTF to facilitate coordination between the \nETESP and support from the other donors through the MDTF. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The people of Aceh and North Sumatra affected by the earthquake and \nBeneficiaries  tsunami disaster \n   \nRisks and  ETESP implementation involves three major risks: (i) the history of \nAssumptions  prolonged conflicts in Aceh; (ii) lack of adequate capacity at the local \ngovernment levels in the devastated regions; and (iii) lack of coherence \nin the implementation of rehabilitation and reconstruction, and lack of \ndonor coordination. The ETESP design aims to mitigate  these risks. \nThe tsunami tragedy has provided a small window of opportunity for the \nGovernment and the Free Aceh Movement to discuss  Aceh\u2019s future. \nPeace  talks  have  been  initiated  in  Helsinki  and  the  Free  Aceh \nMovement. As an interim measure, the Free Aceh Movement and the \nGovernment have agreed to a temporary cease fire. Another important \nmitigating  factor  is  the  level  of  seriousness  and  commitment  the \nGovernment  has  shown  in  preparing  the  DMRR  strategy,  and  in \nmobilizing donor commitments.  ETESP design deals with the conflict \nrisk  by  recognizing  that  the  reconstruction effort needs  to  be fully \nparticipatory.  \n \nWith regard to capacity constraints, the ETESP recognizes the serious \nlocal problems to be  faced. This capacity risk will be mitigated by \nincluding capacity-building support for local governments in all sector \nand  subproject  interventions,  and  providing  adequate  support  for \nproject management and implementation.  \n \nThe ETESP\u2019s flexible design will help mitigate coordination risks by \nformulating sector interventions under two phases. This is to allow for \nadequate time and consultations with central and local governments \nand  donors.  The  subproject  proposals  will  pass  through  a \ncomprehensive assessment process, including in-depth consultations \nwith all relevant and major institutions concerned. \nIn addition, the segregation of women and persistence of gender-based \ndiscriminatory  practices  in  Aceh  may  affect  the  ETESP\u2019s  ability  to \nidentify specific needs and vulnerabilities of women, especially widows \nand  female  heads  of  households,  in  order  to  formulate  adequate \nresponse.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  ETESP  components  will  support \ncommunity organizations, including women\u2019s grassroots organizations \nand networks, to participate in local decision-making to ensure that their \nperspectives  are  included  in  mainstream  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction efforts. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant to Republic of Indonesia for the Earthquake  and Tsunami Emergency Support Project \n(ETESP); (ii) proposed administration of a grant from the Government of the Netherlands for the \nETESP; and (iii) a contribution to the Multidonor Trust Fund (MDTF).  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: ANALYSIS, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  The 26 December 2004 Tsunami \n2.  Tsunamis have been recorded for several centuries, though the frequency of their \noccurrence in the Indian Ocean is low relative to the Pacific where over 300 tsunamis have \nbeen recorded. While Sumatra\u2019s west coast has experienced tidal waves, the event of 26 \nDecember 2004  was the worst in recent history. The earthquake that triggered the tsunami \noccurred at 7:58 am local time (1:58 pm Greenwich mean time), with its epicenter about 250 \nkilometers (km) from Banda Aceh, the capital of Aceh  province, and about 150 km south of \nMeulaboh, off the coast of Sumatra. Originating at a relatively shallow depth of 30 km below the \nIndian Ocean, the earthquake was recorded at 9.0 on the Richter scale, making it the fifth \nlargest in recorded history, and the worst natural disaster since the eruption of Krakatoa in \nIndonesia in 1883, in terms of energy released.  \n \n3.  The United States Geological Survey estimates that up to 1,200 km of the India Plate \nboundary has likely slipped  as a result of the powerful quake. It caused an initial rupture  of \nabout 100 km wide, and an estimated vertical displacement of 15 meters along the fault line. \nThe tsunami triggered by the massive displacement on the seafloor caused unprecedented \ndamage in Aceh province in northern Sumatra (Maps). Fourteen of 21 districts (kabupaten), \nprimarily in the coastal areas of the province, were significantly damaged, while interior areas \nsuffered serious earthquake damage. The tsunami devastated coastal areas in India, Maldives, \nSri Lanka, Thailand, and to some extent in Bangladesh and Myanmar. Its impact was felt as far \nwest as Africa. \n \n4.  As of 5 March 2005, the Government of Indonesia (the Government) reported 126,000 \ndead, 94,470 missing, and 412,438 internally displaced. In Aceh province, with a population of \n3.9 million, over 10% were left homeless. In North Sumatra, the death toll was over 200 and \nabout 20% of the area of Nias Islands was damaged. The disaster has totally devastated \nlivelihoods and damaged private and public property. Public infrastructure collapsed along the \ncoastal lines, and inland destruction was significant due to the earthquake. The tsunami swept \ndebris and seawater up to 5 km inland, crushing and damaging buildings, roads, bridges, \ntelecommunications, water and electricity systems, fisheries infrastructure, crops, fuel outlets, \nand food warehouses. To restore normalcy, infrastructure must be rehabilitated or rebuilt along \nthe west coast, while the human and social dimensions of the disaster call for concerted efforts \nto revive lives and livelihoods and resurrect entire communities.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  The Government\u2019s Response and the Damage and Loss Assessment \n5.  The  Government  swiftly  responded  in  the  immediate  aftermath  of  the  disaster.  Its \nemergency, rescue, and relief efforts were coordinated by the National Coordination Board for \nDisaster Management under the Vice President\u2019s Office and the Coordinating Ministry for ", "2  \nPeople\u2019s Welfare. The  National Coordination Board  was assigned overall responsibility for \nrecovering and burying the dead; placing the survivors in shelters; distributing water, food, \nblankets, and essential medicines; and undertaking emergency removal and disposal of debris. \nAs Aceh was still under a state of civil emergency under the central Government\u2019s jurisdiction, \nthe Ministry of Home Affairs sent in staff to run the local administration and manage public \nservice  responsibilities  of  the  devastated  districts  and  villages.  The  United  Nations  (UN) \nsupported the relief and humanitarian assistance. Bilateral institutions and armed forces of \nseveral countries also played an important role in the initial emergency and relief efforts.  \n \n6.  The scale of the tragedy and the tremendous loss of human lives have led to a massive \nmobilization of emergency support and commitments from the world community for future \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction.  In  order  to  effectively  coordinate  the  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction process and channel domestic and international assistance, in  early January \n2005,  the  President  of  Indonesia  tasked  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency \n(BAPPENAS) with the formulation of a medium-term disaster management, rehabilitation, and \nreconstruction (DMRR) strategy, to be completed by end-March 2005. On 26 March 2005, Vice \nPresident unveiled a 12-volume DMRR blueprint for Aceh reconstruction in Banda Aceh, for \npublic  consultation.  A  Presidential  Decree  on  the  establishment  of  a  new  Implementation \nCoordination Board for Aceh-North Sumatra Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (BKP) , which \nwill be tasked with the implementation of the the DMRR blueprint, is anticipated in April 2005.   \n \n7.  Damage and Loss Assessment. The earthquake and tsunami destroyed large parts of \nBanda Aceh; the nearby districts of Aceh Besar and Aceh Jaya; Meulaboh, the capital of West \nAceh and Lhokseumawe in North Aceh. Coastal areas of other districts were also affected, but \nwith  less  severity,  including  East  Aceh,  Nagan  Raya,  Simeuleue,  South  Aceh,  Pidie, and \nBireuen. To estimate the material impact of the disaster, the Government, with coordination by \nBAPPENAS, and donors jointly undertook a comprehensive damage and loss assessment \n(DLA). The DLA exercise,1 which covered 15 sectors, focused on the damage to public and \nprivate infrastructure (stock) and on the loss of income (flow) stemming from the widespread \ndestruction of productive assets and the environment.  \n \n8.  Overall damage and losses, as estimated on a replacement basis by the joint DLA team, \namount to about $4.7 billion, representing 2.3% of the national gross domestic product (GDP) \nand about 115% of the annual regional GDP of Aceh province. Of this, 37% of the damage was \nincurred in the social sectors (including housing, education, and health); 25% in the productive \nsectors  (including  agriculture,  fisheries,  and  industry  and  trade);  19%  in  the  infrastructure \nsectors (including energy, transport, communications, water and sanitation, irrigation, and flood \ncontrol); and 19% in the environment, governance, and financial sectors. Damage to personal \nproperty,  particularly  housing,  has  been  pervasive.  Reconstruction  and  restoration  of  lost \nhousing stock alone will require $1.4 billion. Reconstruction needs may be significantly different \nand costs considerably higher if the Government and Acehnese residents decide to rebuild \ncommunities in different locations or to provide better public facilities and services than before. \nTable 1 presents a summary of the DLA on a sector basis. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  BAPPENAS and the International Donor Community. 2005.

Over the past 2 decades, the civilian and secessionist conflict in \nAceh has claimed the lives of about 10,000 people. After several attempts at allowing civil \nadministration, the central Government again imposed martial law in May 2003; this was relaxed \nto a state of civil emergency for 6 months beginning in May 2004. Now, the central Government \nhas declared the earthquake and  tsunami as national disasters and  it is providing greater \nadministration support to the province. Immediately following the disaster, Indonesia\u2019s armed \nforces announced a cease-fire to facilitate relief efforts, which was accepted by the Free Aceh \nMovement. Subsequently, the Government has declared a temporary cease fire and engaged in \npeace talks with the Free Aceh Movement. Prospects for early resolution of issues surrounding \nthe conflict are complicated by the movement\u2019s demands for full political autonomy bordering on \nindependence.  \n \n10.  Economic  Context  and  Impact.    Years  of  conflict  have  eroded  the  physical \ninfrastructure and facilities and rendered it difficult to provide effectively functioning basic social \nservices in Aceh. While general health and education indicators in Aceh were comparable to \n ", "4  \nnational averages, the conflict has had a disproportionate impact on social infrastructure in two \nways. First, services in rural areas were neglected due to declining investments as well as \nsecurity concerns at subdistrict and village levels. Second, more than 900 schools have been \ndestroyed or severely damaged since 1998 as a result of the conflict. At a broader level, the \nconflict  has  eroded  public  and  investor  confidence.  Until  the  tragedy,  international \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  had  been  barred  from  operating  in  Aceh,  while \nassistance from multilateral and bilateral agencies was low because of operational difficulties. \n \n11.  In 2003, Aceh\u2019s regional GDP was Rp38.6 trillion ($4.1 billion), accounting for a little \nover 2% of national GDP. Real GDP grew at 3.4% in 2003, relative to the national GDP growth \nrate of 4.3%. On a sector basis, oil and gas had the largest share of GDP at 43%, followed by \nagriculture at 32%. Almost half of Aceh\u2019s labor force of 2.3 million is employed in the agriculture \nsector. Given its special status and abundant resources, Aceh receives a greater share of \nrevenues  from  its  natural  resources  (primarily  oil  and  gas),  since  the  introduction  of \ndecentralization in 1999, relative to other provinces. For instance, until 2009 Aceh is to receive \n70% of the oil revenues generated, while other provinces receive only 15% (with the exception \nof Papua), and the ratios are 40% and 30%, respectively, for gas revenues.  \n \n12.  Given the scale of the disaster and the significant loss of private productive assets, the \nmacroeconomic impact of the disaster is likely to range from a 0.1 to 0.5 percentage point drop \nin the national GDP growth rate of 5.5% projected for 2005. Yet, if the rehabilitation and \nreconstruction activities gain momentum with replacement private and public investments made, \nthe negative impact may be contained. \n \n13.  Social and Poverty Impact. Based on a field survey, the Central Statistical Agency has \ndetermined that 660 Acehnese villages, including outskirts of urban areas, with a combined \npopulation of 650,000 were affected. The disaster struck a sizable proportion of the economy, \nparticularly major market and service centers such as Bandah Aceh, Calang, and Meulaboh, \nwhich bore the brunt of the impact. It struck individuals, households, communities, social \norganizations, and economic chains. Acehnese communities are cohesive, and people live in \nconcentrated areas. The community is the repository of information about resources, assets, \nownership, and identity.  Community social institutions responsible for organizing social and \npersonal lives and mitigating conflict have suffered losses and incapacitation of key persons. \nThis increases the probability of community tensions aggravated further by the sudden influx of \ninternally  displaced  people.  The  multiple  role  of  women\u2014heading  households;  sustaining \nsubsistence economies; raising children; and caring for the sick, elderly, and wounded\u2014has \ncome to form the lifeline of Acehnese communities. In the rebuilding phase, emphasis needs to \nbe placed on restoring and securing women\u2019s livelihoods and supporting women\u2019s groups and \nnetworks whose survival strategies are holding communities together. Such support will be vital \nto rapidly and holistically advancing emotional, social, and economic recovery in the tsunami-\naffected areas. \n \n14.  Despite the conflict, the province kept pace with the rest of Indonesia in general terms. \nFurthermore, as Aceh was outside of the El Nino belt that afflicted much of Indonesia in 1997 \nand 1998, its agriculture-based economy with little manufacturing or trade and relatively small \nexposure to the financial system isolated it from most of the impacts of the crises of those years. \nThe  incidence  of  poverty  in  Aceh  remained  lower  than  the  national  average  until  2001. \nSubsequently, however, the trend reversed, and in 2003 Aceh ranked as the third poorest \nprovince after Papua and Maluku, most likely stemming from the conflict. The disaster is likely to \naffect  the  poor  disproportionately,  by  cutting  access  to  essential  public  services.  Thus ", "  5\ncompensation and asset restoration  must be well targeted to ensure that the needy receive \nsuch support. \n \n15.  Environmental  Impact.  The  earthquake  and  tsunami  have  caused  serious \nenvironmental damage, estimated at above $660 million (Table 1, note). About one fourth is \nattributable to direct destruction of environmental assets, while the remaining corresponds to the \nloss of benefits from environmental assets such as coral reefs and forests, which will need at \nleast a generation to regenerate. The geography of the affected regions is characterized by a \nmountain ridge running from the west to the southeast. The coastal plains  are developed, \nexcept along most of the western coast. The regions have a diverse range of ecosystems and \nfoliage, including coral reefs, mangroves, and different types of forests. On the approximately \n100,000 hectares (ha) of coastal reefs in the affected regions, about 30% have live coral. The \nprovince also has rich water resources, including rivers, lakes, wetlands, and groundwater \nsystems.  The  disaster  had  an  enormous  impact  on  the  environment  in  general,  inflicting \ndamage  on  ecosystems,  plants  and  habitats,  and  animals.  Two  particular  issues  are \nnoteworthy. The disaster generated vast quantities of debris and spread sewage and industrial \nwaste and damaged the ecosystem. It also appears to have altered coastal lines, as well as \naffecting land surface and soil quality. \n \n2.  The Government\u2019s Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Strategy \n16.  BAPPENAS and the development partners have formulated the DMRR strategy2 for \nrestoration of normal life in Aceh and North Sumatra. The strategy distinguishes between three \npartly overlapping phases: immediate emergency and relief operations to be completed within \nthe first 6 months (by June 2005); the rehabilitation phase, which will cover 0.5\u20132 years; and \nreconstruction activities to be initiated along with rehabilitation and carried out over 5 years. The \nstrategy focuses on:  \n \n\u2022  Restoring Lives and Livelihoods. The Government aims to (i) design and implement \nlabor-intensive public works in the short term, (ii) provide the opportunity for families to \nrebuild their own homes, (iii) support families and communities where displaced people \nhave taken refuge, (iv) provide compensation from budgetary resources in a transparent \nmanner,  and  (v)  rebuild  land  registration  offices  and  formulate  effective  dispute \nresolution procedures. \n \n\u2022  Restoring  Economic  Activity.  The  Government  will  (i)  emphasize  labor-intensive \ninfrastructure investments, and purchase all goods and services locally to the extent \npossible;  (ii)  recapitalize  household  and  small  enterprises  with  grants;  (iii)  restore \nbanking and essential financial services quickly; (iv) minimize local and international \ntrade barriers to control price hikes; and (v) reestablish retail and wholesale markets, \nincluding information centers. \n \n\u2022  Restoring  Infrastructure.  The  Government  aims  to  (i)  rebuild  strategic  roads  and \nbridges quickly,  and realign some roads as needed as part of the spatial planning \nprocess;  (ii)  rebuild  air  and  seaports;  (iii)  repair  power  and  telecommunication \ninfrastructure;  and  (iv)  restore  clean  water  supply,  through  temporary  measures  to \nprovide water, and cleaning, desalination, and redigging of wells. \n \n                                                 \n2  BAPPENAS and the International Donor Community. 2005. Indonesia: Notes on Reconstruction \u2013 the December \n26, 2004 Natural Disaster. Jakarta. \n ", "6  \n\u2022  Restoring Government and Civil Institutions. The Government aims to (i) rebuild \nlocal administrations and restore functional responsibility as quickly as possible; (ii) \nstrengthen administrative arrangements and ensure transparency; (iii) establish systems \nto ensure sound delivery of essential public services, particularly to the vulnerable \nsegments of the population; and (iv) support and facilitate the redesigning of cities and \nplaces of economic activity, and \n \n\u2022  Strengthening  Governance  for  Managing  Recovery.  To  effectively  manage  the \nrecovery process, the Government is emphasizing the need for (i) channeling as much \ndonor support as possible through the budget and minimizing off-budget mechanisms, \nprimarily to ensure sound coordination of development assistance; (ii) maximizing the \nuse  of  grant  financing  followed  by  soft  loans;  (iii)  developing  effective  governance \nstructures; and (iv) phasing out central  Government support as the affected regional \ngovernments in Aceh and North Sumatra recover their lost capacities. \n \n17.  The Government has adopted certain core principles to guide DMRR, including (a) using \nparticipatory  decision-making  by  empowering  the  people  of  Aceh;  (b)  ensuring  sound \ncoordination,  for  consistency  and  effectiveness  across  sectors  and  regions;  (c)  utilizing  a \ncomprehensive approach to rebuilding communities, based on in-depth spatial planning and \nlocation analyses; (d) distinguishing between rehabilitation (to achieve minimum standards) and \nreconstruction (to enable Acehnese to move forward); (e) restoring human resource capacity \nacross all sectors, and focusing on delivery of services and strengthening institutions rather than \non projects; and (f) ensuring full fiscal transparency and effective monitoring.  \n \n  3.  Development Partners\u2019 Response \n18.  The response from the international community has been swift. Army, air force, and navy \nunits from  several  countries  supported  the  rescue  and  relief  operations  in  the  immediate \naftermath of the disaster, working alongside various UN agencies. The 6 January 2005 Asian \nTsunami  Summit  held  in  Jakarta  led  to  an  outpouring  of  support  from  the  international \ncommunity. Many development partners worked collectively with the Government to prepare the \nDLA and the DMRR strategy. The subsequent UN Flash Appeal resulted in a contribution of \nclose to $370 million for Indonesia. At the Consultative Group on Indonesia meeting held in \nJanuary 2005, donors committed $1.7 billion for rehabilitation and reconstruction support in \n2005; of this, $1.0 billion is estimated to be channeled through the budget. Several bilateral \ndonors have pledged significant contributions, including Australia (about $780 million in grants \nand soft loans), United States (about $450 million in grants), and European Union (about $265 \nmillion in grants). Other countries, including Canada, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, and United \nKingdom  are  formulating  significant  support  initiatives.  BAPPENAS  is  coordinating  the \nestablishment of a multidonor trust fund (MDTF), which is expected to attract contributions of \nseveral donors.  MDTF is seen as a vehicle largely to pool bilateral resources  in order to \nchannel these through  the budget to ensure  a systematic and coordinated approach to  the \nrehabilitation and reconstruction of Aceh and North Sumatra (para.23, and 91-93).   \n   \n4.  Asian Development Bank Support and Strategy \n19.  ADB\u2019s Strategy and Measures Taken. ADB has had a strategic presence in Aceh and \nNorth Sumatra as a lead donor in the agriculture, coastal resources, irrigation, and health \nsectors. nI some sectors, ti has been the only major international agency operating. This \nproject-oriented experience greatly facilitated ADB\u2019s initial contribution to the DLA work. In the \nimmediate aftermath of the tragedy, ADB established the Aceh Reconstruction Team made up ", "  7\nof 20 experts. Having expertise in almost all the sectors, the team has worked closely with the \nGovernment and the donor community in the DLA and DMRR strategy formulation process, and \neffectively contributed to this major exercise.  \n \n20.  To  expeditiously  mobilize  ADB  support,  the  Government  and  ADB  signed  a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  on  5  January  2005  outlining  a  three-step  approach:  (i) \nreprogramming  ongoing  projects  in  priority  sectors  to  facilitate  support  for  immediate \nrehabilitation; (ii) expanding the scope of projects at an advanced stage of preparation and with \na design relevant to the Aceh situation, such as the proposed Community Water Services and \nHealth Project; and (iii) developing a new comprehensive multisector emergency assistance \nproject. \n \n21.  Major progress has been made on steps (i) and (ii).3 Reprogramming of ongoing projects \nidentified about $64.6 million of loan savings in 11 projects; these resources are available for \nutilization in Aceh and North Sumatra. With regard to step (ii), about $16.4 million in grant \ncofinancing ($7.4 million from the Department for Foreign and International Development of the \nUnited Kingdom, $5 million from the Government of the Netherlands, and $4 million from the \nCanadian International Development Agency) has been secured to rehabilitate and reconstruct \nrural water supply and sanitation systems in Aceh and Nias Islands. The ETESP is a response \nto  step  (iii).  It  will  include  initial  cofinancing  of  $3.5  million  from  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands to support fiduciary oversight of the flow of donor funds, and will be open to \nreceiving cofinancing for other components.  \n \n22.  In addition, five grant project proposals  are being processed for consideration by  the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) for consideration. With a total value of $10 million \nthey support: (i) sustainable livelihood development of coastal fishing communities in Aceh and \nNias ($2.5 million), (ii) rehabilitation of damaged mangrove and coral reef resources in Aceh and \nNias ($1.5 million), (iii) restoration of microenterprise and microfinance in Aceh ($2 million), (iv) \ncommunity social safety net initiatives in Aceh ($2 million), and (v) seismically upgraded housing \ndevelopment in Aceh ($2 million). The geographic focus of these projects will be refined during \nimplementation depending on the emerging needs. \n \n23.  Furthermore, ADB has had intensive discussions with the Government and the World \nBank, in its role as trustee for MTDF, to work out arrangements for ADB\u2019s involvement in MDTF. \nADB\u2019s  contribution  to  the  MDTF  (para.91-93)  is  aimed  at  ensuring  complementarity  and \nconformity between the ETESP and support provided by other donors through the MDTF. \n \n  5.  Lessons and Principles Incorporated in ETESP Design \n24.  The rehabilitation and reconstruction needs are staggering. Quite different from the other \naffected countries, the rebuilding of Aceh is likely to be more challenging given the state of the \npolitical economy, level of development of the province, and relatively weak capacity to absorb \nlarge assistance flows equivalent to about a quarter of  Aceh\u2019s GDP every year for the next 4 \nyears. Based on these factors and ADB\u2019s past experience with emergency assistance, at least \nsix major challenges and lessons have guided ETESP design.  \n \n25.  First, dealing with a natural disaster of this magnitude in a conflict environment calls for \na sound approach to rebuilding with participatory mechanisms across the affected areas in a \ntransparent and accountable manner. Allocation of resources to different villages and districts \n                                                 \n3  The Board information paper circulated on 15 March 2005 provides further details. \n ", "8  \nneed to be in line with the DLA, accepting that nearly every region in the province has felt some \ndegree of stress from this calamity. Unless a conflict-sensitive approach is adopted, prospects \nof genuine reconciliation through rehabilitation and reconstruction are likely to be lost. ADB\u2019s \npast support for conflict-affected communities in Indonesia, for instance in West Timor, has \ndemonstrated that resources need to be distributed in a balanced and equitable manner across \ndirectly and indirectly affected communities. \n \n26.  Second, the rebuilding process will take place in an environment with depleted public \nadministration systems, yet one that is decentralized to the district level. The special autonomy \nprovisions must be respected, and credibility and trust developed among the affected local \nofficials and citizens. As Indonesian decentralization is recent, local government capacity has \ngenerally been nascent and almost erased in the most affected region/districts. Building local \ncapacity, in an incremental manner, to implement programs is critical for ensuring the regional \nautonomy of Aceh and the aspirations of its people. The local governments are being revived \nand have established working groups parallel to those at the central level. Their proposals for \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  will  be  effectively  aligned  with  broader  principles  being \nformulated by the central Government. Sound governance and fiduciary arrangements are \ncritical given the weak capacity, as well as the loss of historical records of population and land \ntitles. They have to be structured so that they do not impede speedy delivery.  \n \n27.  Third, total obliteration in many areas has likely led to radical shifts in the demographic \nand social composition of communities. In coastal and many inland communities, the rebuilding \nprocess will not be initiated unless carefully considered spatial, resettlement, and environment \nassessments and plans are finalized. The Government has proposed rezoning arrangements for \ncoastal areas. This would entail the creation of a buffer zone near the coastline, a medium zone \nof less devastated areas, and an inland zone of least affected areas. In the most affected \ncoastal  zones,  rebuilding  local  infrastructure  and  public  facilities  will  have  to  follow  the \nfinalization of this process and consultations with the affected communities. Resolution of land \nallocation may prove to be one of the most complex issues, in the absence of community \nleadership in many cases. A consistent policy framework needs to be adopted on land retitling \nand building permits provided to those who want to rebuild in their original locations. As the \nland-titling system was not complete before the tsunami, possession of acceptable documents \nmay be rare. A serious challenge is to develop participatory mechanisms to truly enable the \nAcehnese people to determine issues such as those related to spatial location. These issues \nhave many implications and demand comprehensive support.  \n \n28.  Fourth, with close to 80% of the damage and losses suffered by the private sector, the \npublic-private dimensions of the disaster warrant innovative solutions involving the private \nsector. Top priority needs to be assigned to alleviating the public goods constraints by restoring \nand rebuilding vital social and physical infrastructure that is essential for the private sector to \nfunction. Support programs for  removing private constraints should proceed in parallel, and \nlivelihood opportunities need to be restored quickly to provide dignity, comfort, as well as means \nof economic survival to those affected. In particular, the transition from the relief and emergency \nphase to the rehabilitation and reconstruction stage needs to be managed well\u2014recognizing \nthat the line between relief and later activities will vary from area to area and is very much a \nfunction of the level of devastation incurred and local capacity. Restoration of private productive \nassets needs to be actively pursued, through a blend of compensation and targeted support \nschemes. \n \n29.  Fifth, the outpouring of support from within Indonesia and the international community \nmeans that coordination of support is vital. The Government needs to outline clear principles ", "  9\nand  practices  to  guide  the  support  from  the  private  sector,  NGOs,  and  public-private \npartnerships, and has to set up effective mechanisms for donor coordination. The fund flows \nfrom donors that are channeled through the budget as well as outside of the budget need to be \ncarefully monitored, and their impact evaluated and assessed periodically to ensure that the \nDMRR objectives are met. Ensuring sound fiduciary governance is extremely important in the \npostconflict and postdisaster environment given the weak local capacity.  \n \n30.  Sixth, deriving from all of these factors, flexibility is paramount in designing the overall \nproject and subprojects. Needs should be assessed and reassessed as they emerge during \nimplementation of the overall project, and components should be flexible to accommodate \npossible reallocation of resources. Nevertheless, safeguard provisions including environmental \nprotection,  and  poverty  reduction  measures  should  be  included  in  the  design.  Adequate \nstandards for civil works should be maintained during the rehabilitation and reconstruction \nprocess. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n31.  The overall goal of the ETESP is to help rebuild the affected regions and support their \neconomic revival to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Its purpose is to (i) \nfacilitate economic revival in the affected regions by  restoring livelihoods; and (ii) alleviate \nconstraints resulting from the lack of public goods and facilities by restoring essential public \nservices and rebuilding infrastructure. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Components  \n32.  To meet the critical DMRR needs in a flexible manner,  the ETESP is designed as a \nmultisector project facility that follows the sector loan approach. It consists of five principal \nsector groupings: \n \n(i)  Livelihood restoration. Rehabilitate the agriculture and fisheries sectors, the \nmainstay of a majority of the Acehnese, and revive micro and small enterprises. \n \n(ii)  Social service provision. Rehabilitate and reconstruct health and education \nfacilities,  and  support  skills  development  of  the  affected  population  through \nvocational training. \n \n(iii)  Community  infrastructure.  Provide  water  and  sanitation  facilities,  rebuild \nirrigation infrastructure, and rehabilitate and reconstruct the damaged and lost \nhousing stock within an integrated community development framework. \n \n(iv)  Physical infrastructure. Rebuild damaged roads and bridges, restore power \nsupply,  support  sound  spatial  planning,  and  strengthen  environmental \nmanagement systems. \n \n(v)  Fiduciary governance. Ensure sound oversight of donor fund utilization in the \nDMRR process, and facilitate effective delivery of ETESP support. \n \n ", "10  \nC.  Special Features \n33.  Flexibility in Design and Support. With large areas heavily affected, and over 400,000 \ninternally displaced people and others directly or indirectly affected needing some form of \nlivelihood restoration support; the DMRR process will be complex and time-consuming. The \nGovernment\u2019s strategy is expected to evolve and change over time to meet emerging needs. \nWith damages and losses in billions of dollars, effective coordination between the Government \nand donors, and among the latter, will be essential. DMRR support needs to be channeled in a \nsequenced and seamless manner, recognizing that the relief and emergency operations are \nwinding down in many areas, and that rehabilitation activities are already under way in the less \ndevastated regions. In view of these factors, a flexible design is adopted for the ETESP. Its key \nfeatures are as follows (Figure 1, page 12): \n \n(i)  Thematic approach. All activities under the ETESP will be categorized under \ntwo  basic  themes:  facilitating  economic  revival  by  restoring  livelihood,  and \nalleviating public goods constraints by restoring essential public services and \nrebuilding infrastructure.  \n \n(ii)  Clustering of sectors. The ETESP will maintain flexibility in the allocation of \nresources within and across the sector groupings (para. 32), to ensure that ADB \ncan meet the emerging needs and align its support to the plans of other donors. \nPeriodic updates,  with a mapping of donor support as it emerges in various \nsectors,  will  be  provided  in  the  quarterly  reports  on  Asian  Tsunami  Fund \nutilization to the ADB Board of Directors.  \n \n(iii)  Phasing of support. As the level of devastation varies across the affected \nregions, ADB support will need to be designed and delivered in a phased manner \nbased on readiness. Spatial planning is a key dimension of the DMRR process. \nIn the initial stages of phase 1 (on approval of the ETESP), the principal focus \nwill be on rebuilding in areas where DMRR can proceed without complex spatial \ndecisions  and  on  supporting  preparatory  work,  such  as  spatial  planning, \nresettlement surveys and planning, and environment assessments, in the most \ndevastated areas. In phase 2 (tentatively scheduled to begin in the third or fourth \nquarter  of  2005),  once  ground  work  is  undertaken  in  devastated  areas, \nsubprojects will be formulated and launched. Both phases will be completed by \nJune 2008. \n \n34.  Subproject  Modality.  The  ETESP\u2019s  sector  project  approach  facilitates  designing \nsubprojects based on feasibility studies and community consultations. The subproject modality \nwill ensure that ADB can effectively coordinate ETESP components with the support provided \nby other donors, including  MDTF subprojects. ETESP subprojects will be designed, where \nfeasible,  by  integrating  multisector  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  needs.  Cross-sector \nsynergies will be maximized by adopting integrated community development approaches. For \ninstance, in the case of the agriculture and fisheries sectors, a subproject will be defined at the \ndistrict level with all its activities aimed at rehabilitating agricultural or fisheries resources and \nthe related infrastructure, restoring rural livelihoods, and strengthening the related government \ninstitutions and farmer organizations. In the case of irrigation, a subproject will be defined as an \nindependent irrigation system or a group of inter-linked irrigation systems. Integrated community \ndevelopment approaches will be adopted for subprojects in the housing sector. Road sector \nsubprojects will be defined as a specific section of a road, along with part or all of the drainage ", " 11\nand crossing structures within the section. In the case of the health sector, a subproject will be \ndefined at the district level with project support for health care programs. \n \n35.  Addressing the MDG Challenge. In line with its overall goal, the ETESP will be \nstructured as a set of subprojects to help the affected regions eventually progress toward the \nMDGs. The goal is based on the premise that the DMRR efforts toward the MDGs must also \ntake into account the negative impact of the civil conflict on the quantity and quality of public \nservices. The ETESP will support the Government in establishing an MDG monitoring system \nas a decision-making tool to (i) track the overall emergency aid flows to different regions in Aceh \nand North Sumatra, (ii) assess support given the needs, and (iii) redirect aid to underserved \nareas. \n \nD.  Outputs \n \n36.  The ETESP adopts a sequential approach, following on from the support offered by ADB \nunder reprogramming of ongoing projects (para. 21 and footnote 3). Appendix 2 contains details \non  the  sector  interventions  outlined  here,  including  their  scope  and  cost  estimates. \nSupplementary Appendix 1 presents the key guiding principles of ETESP as presented in Figure \n1, page 12, and outlines how they are integrated into the design of the sector interventions. \n \n1.  Livelihood Restoration \n37.  Agriculture. The earthquake and tsunami damage to agriculture has been extensive. \nThe farmers in the affected areas lost their standing crops and livestock, and will continue to \nincur substantial losses in the medium to long term due to siltation and salinization of farmlands, \nand  damaged  infrastructure  for  irrigation,  drainage,  flood  control,  and  land  erosion.  An \nestimated 40,000 ha of cropland and 37,000 ha of tree crops were damaged. Furthermore, \n140,000 large ruminants, 90,000 small ruminants, and 1.6 million poultry were lost. Total \ndamage to agriculture is estimated at $120 million, while income losses until full recovery are \nexpected to reach $145 million (Table 1, note). Agricultural support services have also been \nseverely affected.  \n  \n38.  The ETESP will focus on restoring support services, empowering the community, and \nrestoring crop farming. The recovery of agriculture will require fully functional and effective \nsupport services. This calls for (i) capacity building of institutions and human resources; (ii) \nrecruitment of agricultural graduates, preferably coming from the affected areas, initially on a \ncontractual basis, who may later be absorbed by the district and provincial governments into \ntheir regular cadres; (iii) training for 250 new and 350 existing staff in the participatory extension \nmethodologies,  land  use  planning,  crop  production,  and  remedial  measures  to  address \nsalinization and other tsunami-related issues; and (iv) rehabilitation of key agricultural facilities, \nand provision of necessary equipment and vehicles. \n \n39.  Fisheries. Fisheries is one of the hardest hit sectors. Most of the fishing communities in \nthe affected areas lost their boats, fishing gear, and equipment; incurred heavy damage to \nfishponds and small-scale processing facilities; and will remain affected in the medium to long \nterm by the damage to the coastal resources and the supporting infrastructure, such as fish-\nlanding  and  auction  market  facilities.  The  restoration  and  recovery  of  livelihoods  may  be \npainstakingly slow. Total damage to the sector is estimated at $260 million. Income losses until \nfull recovery are expected at $408 million. Furthermore, the loss to the coastal environment in \nterms of loss of coral reefs, mangroves, and sea-grass bed is estimated at $468 million. \nFisheries  extension  and  support  services  have  also  been  severally  affected. \n ", " \nFigure 1: Framework for the Earthquake and Tsunami Emergency Support Project \n1\n2\n \nOverall Goal: Help rebuild the affected regions and support their revival to meet the Millennium Development Goals. \n \nImmediate Purpose: The Project will provide disaster management, rehabilitation, and reconstruction (DMRR) support to  \n(i)  facilitate economic revival by restoring livelihoods (Theme 1), and  \n(ii)  restore essential public services and rebuild infrastructure (Theme 2).  \nPhase 1: Focus on Urgent Priorities and DMRR in \nPhase 2: Focus on DMRR in Devastated Zones  \nLess Devastated Zones (April 2005\u2013June 2007) \n(Until mid-2008) \nTheme 1  Theme 2 \n    Theme 1  Theme 2 \nFacilitate restoration of:  Priority focus on     \n    \u2022 Economic revival support  \u2022 Expansion of phase 1 \n\u2022 Livelihood through targeted  \u2022 health  through formal institutional  activities into devastated \ninterventions in agriculture,  \u2022 skills development  mechanisms and self-help  zones, and other social \nfisheries, and enterprises  \u2022 rural water and sanitation  groups in agriculture,  services such as \n\u2022 Lost stock of private  \u2022 irrigation and flood control   fisheries, and enterprises   education \nhousing, in an integrated  \u2022 roads and bridges  \u2022 Community-based housing  \u2022 Community infrastructure \nmanner to restore local  \u2022 spatial planning,  integrated with other  \u2022 Spatial redesign of \neconomies  environmental and other  development and livelihood  affected regions \n  technical assessments  initiatives  \u2022 Power (with focus on rural \n  \u2022 fiduciary governance   electrification) \n \nKey Guiding Principles for all Subprojects: 1. Communitywide integrated development, 2. Participatory mechanisms in design and \nimplementation, 3. Capacity building in public administration, 4. Sound spatial planning and environmental management, 5. Facilitation of \nprivate sector participation, and 6. Enhancement of fiduciary governance. \n ", "    13 \n40.  To help rehabilitate the fisheries sector and reestablish livelihoods, the ETESP will \nprovide technical and financial support and production inputs to (i) 12,000 affected small-scale \nfishers for repairing and restoring their fishing boats, boat engines, and gear; (ii) 2,000 affected \nsmall-scale fish farmers for rehabilitation of 3,000 ha of fishponds in seven major aquaculture \ndistricts; and (iii)  80 affected coastal communities for rehabilitation of  about 12 fish-landing \nfacilities, as well as for community-based applied research activities.  \n \n41.  Microenterprises. Aceh\u2019s economy has been dominated by family-owned firms, many \nof them small and most operating outside the formal economy. Most Acehnese households \nhave relied either on agriculture or fishing as the main source of income. According to a 2002 \nsurvey  on  small-scale  informal  businesses  by  the  national  statistical  service,  only  65 \nestablishments  classified  as  medium  or  large  firms  were  operating  in  2002. The survey \nestimated that Aceh had around 190,000 micro and small enterprises, each employing an \naverage of 1.8 people. About 80,000 of these businesses, or about 140,000 jobs, are estimated \nto have been lost due to the disaster. Micro and small enterprises did not enjoy broad access to \nfinancial services prior to the disaster, though some institutional providers of microfinance were \noperating prior to the tsunami, notably, about 20 village banks, of which at least nine have \nsurvived the disaster and resumed limited operations. There has, however, never been a strong \ninstitutional foundation for microfinance in Aceh, necessitating efforts to develop grassroots \nfoundations  for  institutional  microfinance,  starting  with  the  microenterprises  themselves.  In \naddition,  the  small  surviving  microfinance  institutions  need  assistance  to  recover  their \nsustainability. The ETESP will establish a technical support unit to manage the microenterprise \ncomponent and provide technical assistance to microfinance institutions. The ETESP will  \n \n(i)  Support the development of a commercial microfinance system. Substantial \nsupport is needed for reviving livelihoods in the affected regions, and sustainable \nincome  generating  capacity  is  a  prerequisite  to  creating  and  expanding \nmicrofinance  institutions,  including  rural  banks,  many  of  which  are  privately \nowned, and other institutions including savings and credit associations. The \nETESP, building on the JFPR grant project (para.22), will develop appropriate \nmodalities to deliver microfinance support. In particular, the ETESP will establish \na microfinance fund, to provide funding support for microfinance institutions and \nthe  Provincial  Development  Bank  that  seek  to  serve  microenterprises.  The \nETESP will support such institutions in the areas of  operations, product design, \nfinancial management, accounting and auditing. \n \n(ii)  Establish an innovation fund. The fund will provide long-term debt and/or \nequity for (a) demonstrably viable financial institutions that want to restore and \nexpand their operations in the province, but are short of investment capital; and \n(b) new financial institutions, primarily leasing companies. The fund will support \nfinancial  innovations,  and  promote  investment  in  new  financial  firms.  Some \nShariah-based institutions are operating, though on a small scale. Utilizing and \nexpanding this risk-sharing financial modality will be worthwhile. Shariah leasing \nis a new concept and appears to offer promise as a way of financing small-scale \nequipment leasing needed by existing and new  micro and small enterprises. \nLocal institutions that demonstrate fundamental soundness may be allowed to \nborrow longer term to finance their capital expenditures, including investments in \nnew service technologies. \n \n ", "14   \n2.       Social Service Provision \n42.  Health. The DLA for the health sector estimated that Aceh suffered damage of $82 \nmillion, with about 75% borne by public sector facilities. The estimates include the cost of \nreconstruction of lost or damaged buildings, replacement of damaged equipment, replacement \nof staff perished in the disaster, and additional cost of health treatment and public health \ninterventions in response to the disaster.  \n \n43.  Before initiating the DMRR activities, ETESP will support the development of a strategic \nplan for rehabilitating and reconstructing health services, building on the DMRR blueprint, to \nprovide effective approaches for health service delivery to address the health needs and \nplacement of population, identify challenges faced by the public sector, and assess strengths \nand complementary support offered by NGOs and the private sector. This assessment will help \nthe Government develop a health system that will appropriately address health needs with \nimproved efficiency and effectiveness.  \n \n44.  The ETESP will go beyond replacing the damaged health facilities, and will restructure \nthe health care delivery system with full participation of the affected communities. Health sector \ninterventions of the ETESP will (i) design an efficiently functioning and rationalized health \nservice delivery network for the province; (ii) strengthen primary health care and its referral links \nto  district  hospitals;  build  sustainable  institutions  of  continuing  education  for  nurses  and \nmidwives; and strengthen provincial and district health capacity; (iii) strengthen 15\u201320 selected \nfacilities that provide outreach services for primary health care; and (iv) upgrade and reequip \nabout 2\u20133 district hospitals. Provincial and district health management will receive priority \nattention  in  terms  of  providing  capacity-building  support  for  sector  planning,  coordination, \nmanagement, human resource planning and development, and financial management and \naccounting systems to track the flow of health sector support. This component will also develop \nmechanisms to allow for public-private partnerships in service delivery, training, and monitoring.  \n \n45.  Education. The disaster has caused serious damage to the education infrastructure and \nled to the loss of thousands of education professionals. About 600 schools in Aceh and North \nSumatra are estimated to have been destroyed or damaged extensively. This includes at least \n30 madrasah schools. An estimated 2,500 teachers are estimated to have died, in addition to \nserious losses among education administrators in local governments. About 70,000 children are \nestimated  to  be  among  the  internally  displaced  people.  Many  teachers  and  students  are \nseverely traumatized. The impact on poor families has been significant in terms of disruption of \neducation services, and imperiling future human resource development and livelihoods of the \npoor in these areas. The need for rehabilitation and reconstruction of schools and madrasah is \nurgent in order to minimize disruption to the education of children and young adults, reduce \ntrauma, and bring normalcy to people\u2019s lives. The total cost of rehabilitation and reconstruction \nin the education sector is estimated by the Government at over $700 million, with primary to \nsenior secondary schools and madrasahs accounting for $300 million. \n \n46.  ADB\u2019s ongoing projects in basic and higher education provide immediate support for \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  schools  and  higher  education  institutions,  cumulatively \namounting to $16.5 million. Several other donors are involved in the education sector. The \nETESP will support rehabilitation and reconstruction of educational institutions in phase 2, \nbased on a full mapping of the DMRR needs with the support of other development partners.  \n \n47.  Skills Development. Close to a million people directly or indirectly affected by the \ndisaster will need some form of livelihood support in the next 2\u20133 years. As a considerable part ", "    15 \nof the private sector has been wiped out, people who have lost their livelihoods and out-of-\nschool youth must be reskilled through vocational training that will help them find employment. \nThe ETESP will provide support for training about 6,000 individuals in utility-oriented technical \nareas, such as electrical and electronics, computer, automotive, carpentry, brick-making, and \nsewing.  Appropriate targeting mechanisms will be used to ensure coordination with support \nfrom the Government and other donors. \n \n3.      Community Infrastructure \n48.  Rural Water Supply and Sanitation. Water and sanitation service coverage in Aceh \nand North Sumatra was below the national average before the disaster. Only about 9% of the \nAceh population and 24% of North Sumatra inhabitants benefited from piped water supply, \nacross rural and urban areas. Similar to many other areas throughout the country, system \nefficiency was low, with nonrevenue water estimated at 30\u201350% on average. The majority of the \npopulation, in particular in rural areas, relied on self-provision or community-based systems \n(mostly dug wells and hand pumps), and private small-scale water providers and vendors. Prior \nto the tsunami, the sanitation sector was mainly characterized by on-site sanitation (septic tanks \nand pit latrines), but coverage was extremely low and virtually nonexistent in many rural villages \nof these two provinces. What was existent before has now been completely wiped out in most \nurban and rural areas struck by the tsunami. Data on water supply damage, in particular in rural \nareas, are still sparse and do not include rural sanitation damage and losses. The DLA is likely \nto be substantially revised upward once more detailed assessments are completed. \n \n49.  The improvement of water supply and sanitation facilities for the population in Aceh and \nNorth Sumatra has reached a new level of urgency. Increases in the incidence of waterborne \nand water-related diseases such as diarrhea, intestinal worms, skin diseases, malaria, and \ndengue are highly probable in the current situation. While the focus during the immediate relief \nphase has been on prevention of communicable disease outbreaks, which have the potential to \nkill many people, concerted interventions will be necessary to (i) ensure that disease outbreaks \nare controlled after phasing out of relief efforts, and (ii) reduce the incidence of waterborne and \nwater-related diseases in the provinces in the medium and long term on a sustainable basis. \n \n50.  The ETESP will follow the design of the Aceh-North Sumatra Emergency Assistance \nGrant component under the proposed Community Water Services and Health Project. In phase \n1, the ETESP will provide support to rehabilitate rural water and sanitation facilities in villages \nwith repairable damage and extend at least temporary coverage of facilities into communities \nwith a large influx of  internally displaced people. Based on progress, feasibility, and spatial \nplanning assessments,  the ETESP will develop new facilities in reestablished settlements in \nphase 2.  For new facilities, communities themselves will decide on the type of technology to be \nused, plan and implement the activity with the assistance of community facilitators, take charge \nof  operation  and  maintenance  on  a  permanent  basis,  and  monitor  and  evaluate  the \nsustainability and use of the new services. The provision of appropriate technical solutions at \naffordable  costs  will  be  coupled  with  capacity  strengthening  of  local  governments  and \ncommunities to ensure the sustainability of the infrastructure provided, through information, \neducation, and communication campaigns on waterborne and water-related  diseases; and \nsanitation and hygiene behavioral change programs.  About 150 villages and 80,000 people in \nthe affected districts are expected to benefit from the ETESP. \n \n51.  Irrigation. Prior to the disaster, 465 irrigation schemes in Aceh covered over 335,000 \nha. They were classified as government-developed schemes (about 57% of the area) and \nfarmers\u2019 schemes (about 43%). Due to poor maintenance, only 70% of the schemes were \n ", "16   \nfunctional. The irrigation schemes have suffered both tsunami and  earthquake damage. The \ntsunami damage was caused by the temporary flooding of downstream parts of schemes \nsituated relatively close to the coastline. The damage consists mainly of deposits of various \nnatures on fields, and partial or complete destruction of the canal infrastructure.  Damage of \nirrigation systems, including technical, semitechnical, and simple systems, are reported in 10 \ndistricts4 in Aceh and 6 districts in North Sumatra,5 although the latter account for only 5% of the \noverall damage. Typical damage includes cracks and occasional displacement/settlement of \nmasonry structures, slip failures in canal and river embankments, and collapse of culverts. More \nthan 64,000 ha of irrigation schemes in Aceh are reported to have some kind of earthquake \ndamage, though information on village irrigation schemes is being still collated. Total damage to \nthe Government-developed irrigation schemes is estimated at Rp667 billion ($72 million).  \n52.  The ETESP will rehabilitate high-priority, tsunami and earthquake damaged irrigation \ninfrastructure with a total service area of about 32,600 ha. In phase 1, rehabilitation support will \nbe provided to irrigation infrastructure in the less-damaged areas of the northeast coast of Aceh \n(31,300 ha) and North Sumatra (1,300 ha). Phase 1 will also provide for feasibility studies of \nirrigation schemes covering 7,000 ha in the heavily affected areas on the west coast of Aceh, \nwhich will be rehabilitated during phase 2.  \n \n53.  Provision of Housing within an Integrated Community Development Framework. \nThe DLA estimates indicate that about 127,000 houses have been completely destroyed, \ndisplacing over 400,000 people. Furthermore, about 152,000 housing units were damaged at \nabout 50% of their value. The overall damage has been estimated at $1.4 billion, including \nreconstruction and rehabilitation costs, temporary shelter, debris removal, tertiary infrastructure \nrepair, and furniture. Much of the damage was concentrated near the coastal zones in  Aceh \nBarat, Aceh  Besar, Aceh Jaya, Banda Aceh and Kota Meulaboh. The losses transcend the \nphysical  impact.  While  affected  by  the  civil  conflict,  which  impeded  delivery  of  essential \nservices, housing settlements still functioned as homogeneous communities. Many have now \nbeen torn apart. In many locations land ownership records and planning documents are lost. \nThe housing rehabilitation/reconstruction program will be based on the Government\u2019s policy \ndecision to grant a 36 square meter core housing unit to all earthquake-tsunami affected \nfamilies, irrespective of their previous housing status. A range of delivery mechanisms will be \nneeded,  including  community-based  housing,  support  for  private  housing,  public  housing \nschemes, self-help rebuilding programs, and NGO-provided housing. None of these approaches \nalone would be able to meet all requirements.  \n \n54.  The ETESP will cover replacement and repairs of about 24,000 units. Given the urgent \nneed of those without any housing, the focus will be on providing new shelters. The housing \nsubprojects will be designed in coordination with other development partners likely to provide \nsupport\u2014World Bank, Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit-Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr \nWiederaufbau (KfW-GTZ), UN Habitat, and World Vision. The ETESP will facilitate community \nparticipation and finance community-based housing (both rehabilitation and reconstruction), \nestablishment of support centers to provide materials and skilled labor where appropriate, and \nprovision of a microcredit facility for house expansions. It will also provide essential additional \nsupport for neighborhood infrastructure like on-site water and sanitation works; and may also \ncover off-site water and sanitation infrastructure, paths, streets, and basic drainage, which in \nmany cases need to be treated as an integral part of such subprojects. Initial priority will be \n                                                 \n4  Aceh Barat, Aceh Barat Daya, Aceh Besar (Banda Aceh), Aceh Jaya, Aceh Selatan, Aceh Utara, Aceh Timur, \nBireuen, Nagan Raya, and Pidie. \n5  Deli Serdang, Langkat, Nias, Madina, Serdang Bedagai, and Tapanuli Tengah.  ", "    17 \ngiven to urban or semi-urban areas. The ETESP will cover some anti-seismic capacity needs \nand safeguards for later house expansion, and will promote the use of environment-friendly, \npreferably locally available and renewable building materials. The water and sanitation works \nwill make use of appropriate low-cost decentralized technologies that are easy to operate and \nmaintain. The housing component will utilize only sites for which land titles are available or \ntenure status is assured. A team of housing experts is being engaged to help structure this \ncomponent  to  ensure  that  the  communities  receive  the  necessary  technical  support  and \nmaterials for the reconstruction. \n \n4.      Physical Infrastructure \n55.  Spatial Planning and Environmental Management. With many areas swept by the \ntsunami, government and other groups see an opportunity to introduce a new land use/zoning \nplan before commencing large-scale DMRR activities. This ETESP component will support the \nrehabilitation and reconstruction process for Aceh and North Sumatra by providing technical \nsupport, in an adaptive and flexible manner, to the integrated participatory spatial planning \nprocess, incorporating the dimensions of environmental management and disaster mitigation. \nCommunity participation in the decision-making process and ownership in the rebuilding of the \naffected areas will be at the core of the activities, and relevant institutional capacities will be \nreestablished. Already successfully tested principles and procedures of integrated coastal zone \nand watershed management in Indonesia provide a framework for decision-making, and will be \napplied and further adapted to the specific context of the tasks ahead. \n56.  In support of the process of planning for a sustainable future for the affected areas, \nenvironmental criteria for the spatial planning and zoning process will be developed, and \nbaseline environment-related information collected. Technical advice will be provided on ADB \nand government policies, laws, and regulations relating to the requirements for environmental \nassessment and to carry out environmental assessments for subprojects, in accordance with \nthe environmental assessment and review procedures as they have been set up for the entire \nETESP.  \n57.  Road Sector. Of the six major roads in the affected areas, 22% of the road pavement \nand 10% of the bridges are estimated to be either severely damaged or completely destroyed. \nThe road network along the west, east, and north coasts of Aceh province and in Nias Islands of \nNorth Sumatra province has been damaged with some sections entirely washed away by the \ntsunami waves. On the 294 km Banda Aceh-Meulaboh road, 80 km are missing, 120 km are \nheavily damaged, and almost two thirds of the 171 bridges have been destroyed. The Banda \nAceh-Krueng Raya road on the north coast and Banda Aceh urban roads have also been \ndamaged; about 50% of the 158 km needs to be reconstructed. On Nias Islands, north and \nsouthwest roads have been damaged.  On about 30 km of the Banda Aceh-Lhoksemauwe-\nBts.Sumut road, located along the east coast, the pavement is cracked partly due to the \nearthquake. Following the destruction of the west coast road, the traffic on the east coast road is \nincreasing beyond its capacity. Due to impassable or heavily damaged roads, the traffic is \ndiverted through much longer and congested routes. The economic losses due to vehicle \noperating cost increase are estimated at about $100 million equivalent.  Overall damage to \ntransport infrastructure is estimated at $178 million.  \n58.  The Government has requested ADB to help rehabilitate and reconstruct the east coast \nroad (Banda Aceh-Sigli-Lhokseumawe-Bts.Sumut road), Banda Aceh-Krueng Raya road, and \nBanda Aceh urban roads. The total road length to be rehabilitated, including bridges, is 115 km. \nInitial support to rehabilitate 20 km of the affected roads will be provided under an ongoing \n ", "18   \nproject.6 The ETESP will finance the rehabilitation and partial reconstruction of the remaining 95 \nkm of damaged roads and bridges. Additional assistance may be needed to upgrade and repair \nroads currently under stress due to heavy relief use. This will be monitored during phase 1. \n \n59.  Energy Sector. Damage to public power supply is concentrated in Aceh, particularly in \nBanda  Aceh,  Bireuen,  Meulaboh,  and  Sigli  regions.  The  main  damage  is  to  distribution \nnetworks. The National Electricity Corporation estimates the damage in these four regions at \n1,485 circuit-km of medium voltage lines, 3,404 circuit-km of low voltage lines, 45 megavolt-\namperes of distribution transformer capacity, and 90,000 household customer connections. The \n150-kilovolt transmission lines and substations are practically unaffected and are functioning \nnormally. Damage to generation facilities was also less severe. The main power plants in Banda \nAceh and Meulaboh only suffered minor damage to transformer and maintenance facilities. A 10 \nmegawatt barge-mounted power plant has significant hull damage. Taking into account damage \nto  the  distribution  networks,  generation  facilities, and  National Electricity Corporation office \nbuildings  and  warehouses,  the  corporation  estimates  the  total  damage  at  $45.6  million \nequivalent. \n \n60.  The ETESP will help restore power supply in the affected regions of Banda Aceh, \nMeulaboh, and Sigli by reconstructing 31 circuit-km of medium voltage and 1,294 circuit-km of \nlow voltage distribution lines, and 35 megavolt-amperes of transformer capacity. Most of the \ndamaged medium voltage distribution lines will be restored with resources from an ongoing \nproject.  The  ETESP  will  focus  on  low  voltage  distribution  lines  as  an  extension  of  the \nreprogramming support. \n \n5.  Fiduciary Governance \n61.  Given DMRR needs of around $4.7 billion over the next 4 years, fund flows through the \nbudget  to  line  ministries  and  local  governments  will  be  substantial.  Sound  oversight \narrangements are vital to ensure that donor assistance is utilized in an efficient, transparent, \nand accountable manner.  ADB has adopted a comprehensive approach to ensure that effective \ngovernance arrangements are in place to help oversee the flow of funds of donor assistance at \nlarge,  as  well  as  the  flow  of  funds  of  ETESP.  ETESP  support  for  enhancing  fiduciary \ngovernance consists of two sub-components aimed at: \n  a.  Strengthening fiduciary oversight \n(i)  ETESP will support the Ministry of Finance  in establishing a special treasury \noffice for DMRR activities. The office will act as a dedicated cash manager for the \nGovernment and as an important conduit in the flow of funds for DMRR, including \nthe handling of foreign exchange transactions, which is currently done only in \nJakarta. Given the emergency needs, this dedicated payment facility will expedite \nthe local delivery of services. The ETESP will also support the design of effective \ninternal  control  systems  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to  be  utilized  at  all \ngovernment levels.    \n(ii)  ETESP will leverage support for state audit institutions with cofinancing from the \nGovernment of Netherlands to strengthen fiduciary oversight for DMRR activities7 \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2000.

BPK will submit cases of obvious misappropriation to the Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s Office and the Commission for Eradication of Corruption. The ETESP \nwill provide operational support for investigative activities of the commission.   \nb.  Enhancing governance in the delivery of ETESP assistance \n(i)  ETESP will strengthen the capacity of the  newly established  BKP to  ensure \neffective  delivery  of  ETESP  support,  with  focus  on:  (a)  sound  financial \nmanagement \u2013 to record all transactions in a transparent manner and track the \nflow of funds to the final stages of utilization to enhance overall transparency, \naccountability,  and  disclosure;  (b)  designing  administrative  accountability \nmechanisms \u2013 to help BKP and other concerned government authorities to \nimprove the overall accountability of DMRR support; (c) efficient procurement \narrangements \u2013 to design effective procurement mechanisms and systems, and \nundertake  special  and  random  procurement  audits  and  performance \nchecks/audits  in  the  implementation  of  ETESP;  and  (d)  effective  project \nimplementation \u2013 to provide overall support for implementation of ADB-supported \nprojects and subprojects in Aceh and North Sumatra        \n(ii)  ETESP  will  enhance  overall  accountability  of  ETESP  assistance,  through \nparticipatory planning and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, with focus on \n(a) community participation \u2013 to facilitate networking civil society and NGOs as \nintermediaries for support in a transparent and effective manner; (b) using land \ntenure assessment to support restoration of land records and facilitate resolution \nof disputes through participatory mechanisms in selected parts of Aceh; (c) \nrealizing the MDGs  \u2013 through designing a real-time monitoring, reporting and \nevaluation system, with benchmarks based on predisaster data, that will help \nmonitor the distribution of DMRR support across the affected regions, with the \nultimate aim of ensuring that they are supported in meeting quantifiable targets \nunder the MDGs in a balanced manner; and (d) establishing an effective system \nfor monitoring subproject progress under the ETESP and evaluating mid-course \noutcomes.8   \n \nE.

The Netherlands Government will finance $3.5 million equivalent for \nthe fiduciary oversight support component of the ETESP. The Government will finance the \nremaining $28.0 million of the local costs covering local taxes and other regular administrative \ncosts.  The financing plan for the project is shown in Table 3. \n \nTable 3:  Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSource  Total  \nADB through Asian Tsunami Fund for ETESP  290.0 \nGovernment of Netherlands  3.5 \nGovernment of Indonesia  28.0 \nTotal   321.5 \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management  \n64.  The Government is expected to issue a Decree establishing the BKP in April 2005 \n(para.6), to coordinate the overall implementation of DMRR support in the affected regions. With \noffices in Banda Aceh and Jakarta, BKP will be responsible for all DMRR activities supported by \nany donors, including the MDTF or other bilateral development partners. The structure of BKP, ", "    21 \nas per the current plan being formulated by the Government, provides for (i) an implementation  \ncoordination board to manage day-to-day operations; (ii) a steering board, comprising selected \ncabinet  ministers,  the  governors  of  Aceh  and  North  Sumatra,  and  heads  of  district \nadministrations,  to  act  as  a  steering  committee  for  BKP;  and  (iii)  a  supervisory  board, \ncomprising various NGOs, universities, and other respected institutions, to provide community \noversight of DMRR activities. BKP is expected to have six operational departments along \nfunctional lines. In addition, DMRR activities will be subject to independent external audit.  \nDetails of the proposed BKP structure are in Appendix 4. \n \n65.  Once established, BKP will be the Executing Agency for the ETESP, with responsibility \nfor its overall management and coordination. In the interim, BAPPENAS will function as the \nacting Executing Agency. ETESP subprojects will be implemented by the line ministries and the \nlocal governments concerned. The relative roles of BKP and the concerned ministries and local \ngovernments will be guided by the eventual organizational structure of BKP.  For day-to-day \nETESP  management,  a  dedicated,  centralized  project  management  office  (PMO)  will be \nestablished within the BKP secretariat to (i) coordinate ETESP implementation; (ii) ensure that \nADB support is fully aligned with the DMRR strategy; (iii) enhance synergies and ensure close \ncoordination  of  ADB  support  with  projects  financed  by  the  MDTF  and  other  development \npartners; and (iv) provide guidance to, and monitor the activities of, the project management \nunits (PMUs) to be established in the line ministries. As BKP is likely to face significant \ndemands on its resources,  the ETESP will provide support to the PMO to ensure sound \ncoordination of subproject implementation. This support will take the form of a dedicated PMO \nmanager reporting to the head of BKP, and appropriate technical and administrative staff.  \n \n66.  In terms of implementation arrangements at the line ministry and local government \nlevels, the ETESP will adopt a simplified structure reflecting the emergency character of the \nassistance. The implementation of subprojects in each sector covered by the ETESP will be \nundertaken by the concerned line ministry, which will act as the Implementing Agency (IA), \nworking  in  collaboration  with  the  local  governments  concerned.  Each  IA  will  establish  an \nadequately staffed PMU, which will coordinate with the PMO in BKP. The provincial and district \ngovernments (through the line bureaus) will work with the PMUs for subproject implementation.  \n \n67.  The PMO will be responsible for (i) providing guidelines to the PMUs on the fiduciary \nsystem, including funds flow and disbursement, procurement, record keeping, and reporting; (ii) \nconsolidating and reviewing subproject proposals from the IAs to be submitted for  BKP and \nADB approval; (iii) providing guidance to the PMUs in the preparation of bidding documents; \nand  reviewing  the  procedures  followed  by  the  PMUs  for  the  procurement  of  civil  works, \nequipment,  goods,  and  related  services  for  all  ETESP  components;  (iv)  making \nrecommendations on any special arrangements that may be adopted to provide small grants \nunder the livelihood components to the affected communities and NGOs executing selected \nsubprojects, as well as on implementation arrangements for community-contracted rehabilitation \nactivities; (v) submitting the required withdrawal applications for disbursements, including the \nrelated  supporting  documentation  and  reconciliation  of  the  imprest  (special)  account;  (vi) \npreparing the consolidated financial reports from the PMUs as required; (vii) preparing and \nsubmitting progress reports to BKP and ADB; and (viii) coordinating the independent audit of \nsubprojects and the PMO itself. The Government has agreed to establish the PMO, and appoint \nthe project manager and key PMO staff immediately following the establishment of the BKP. \nADB has approved advance action to recruit the PMO consultants. \n \n68.  The PMUs will closely liaise with the local government working groups in formulating \nsubprojects in line with the DMRR strategy, and will finalize and consolidate sector proposals for \n ", "22   \nsubmission to BKP for evaluation, in coordination with the PMO. During implementation, the \nPMUs will ensure that the guidelines and procedures established by the PMO are followed and \nthat all operational and fiduciary requirements outlined are met in a satisfactory manner. All the \nfinancial and project management tasks outlined in para.67 for the PMO will be applicable to the \nPMUs as well. \n \n2.  Subproject Selection Criteria and Approval \n69.  BKP, with support from the PMO and the PMUs, will consolidate subproject proposals \nfrom the local governments, line ministries, and its own departments for consideration for \nfinancing under the ETESP. After having compiled and evaluated the proposals, the PMU will \nsubmit them to BKP and ADB for final selection and approval in accordance with sector-specific \ncriteria agreed upon by the Government and ADB for each ETESP component.  \n \n70.  ADB is in the process of establishing an Extended Mission to Sumatra (EMS) in Medan \nand extension facilities in Kota Banda Aceh.  ADB\u2019s Indonesia Resident Mission, with support \nfrom the EMS and its extension facilities, will coordinate with the Government and donor \ncommunity in Jakarta and Banda Aceh to ensure that none of the subprojects overlap or \nduplicate initiatives of other agencies. In addition to the sector-specific criteria to be established \nby the IAs and ADB, the following general criteria will be applied: \n \n(i)  clear justification backed by damage, loss, and needs assessment of acceptable \nquality and standards; \n(ii)  assessment of the social and economic impact of the subproject, as well as of its \ntechnical feasibility and sustainability, with linkages to the attainment of the \nMDGs outlined; \n(iii)  participatory consultations with local communities in the subproject selection and \ndesign;  \n(iv)  field consultations with the local government, line ministry, donors, civil society \norganizations (CSOs) and NGOs to avoid duplication of other activities pursued;  \n(v)  compliance  with  generally  accepted  design  parameters,  including  disaster \nresistance and any minimum acceptable standards that the Government may \nprescribe;  \n(vi)  compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies and provisions such as Environment \nPolicy (2002),  Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), and the agreed \nEnvironmental Assessment Review and Procedures (Appendix 5);9  \n(vii)  for all subprojects involving land acquisition, resettlement, or spatial planning, \ncompliance with the Government\u2019s applicable laws and regulations,  the ADB \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and the agreed Land Acquisition and \nResettlement  Policy  Framework  and  Procedural  Guidelines  (LARPFPG)  \n(Appendix 6);10 and \n(viii)  subproject activities carried out in accordance with the ADB Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples  and  in  accordance  with  the  Indigenous  Peoples  Development \nFramework (Appendix 7), which has been agreed by the Government and ADB. \n \n71.  The  PMU  will  prepare  subproject proposals in formats  to  be  agreed  between  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  at  the  preparation,  submission, \n                                                 \n9  Supplementary Appendix B presents the Land Acquisition and Resettlement Policy Framework and Procedural \nGuidelines, prepared by the Government.  \n10  Supplementary Appendix C presents the full environmental assessment and review procedure.    ", "    23 \nimplementation, and benefits monitoring and evaluation stages. The first three subprojects \nunder each component to be implemented will be subject to prior review and approval by ADB \nbefore commencement. Thereafter, only subprojects costing more than $500,000 equivalent will \nhave to be submitted to ADB for prior review and approval.  All subproject proposals  are \nexpected to be submitted for evaluation and approval by 31 September 2007. However, those \nsubprojects exceeding $10 million will be submitted for evaluation and approval prior to 31 \nDecember  2006,  to  allow  sufficient  time  for  procurement  and  implementation  prior  to  the \nindicated ETESP closing date of June 2008. In the event that any subproject not requiring ADB \nprior approval does not meet the subproject selection criteria, then the Government will not use \nthe ETESP proceeds to finance the subproject, and will provide financing from its own or other \nresources. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n72.  In  line  with  its  emergency  assistance  nature,  ETESP  implementation  will  start \nimmediately  after  Board  approval  and  be  completed  in  about  3  years.  Phase 1 will be \nimplemented between April 2005 and June 2008, and  phase 2  tentatively between October \n2005  and  June  2008.  The  PMUs  will  prepare  implementation  schedules  for  individual \nsubprojects. \n \n4.  Procurement \n73.  Given the urgent DMRR needs, procurement of goods, services, and works will be \ncarried out in a manner consistent with the simplified and expedient procedures permitted under \nthe ADB Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy and ADB Guidelines for Procurement. In \ngeneral, ADB procedures for reconstruction assistance after disasters allow maximum flexibility, \nso that project activities can start promptly. National procurement will be the preferred mode for \nall civil works because of the relatively short implementation period, the small size of contract \npackages, and the wide geographic spread of subproject sites. Community participation will be \nencouraged in procurement, and local goods and services will be given priority to encourage \neconomic revival in the affected regions. \n \n74.  The  ADB  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  provides  that  to  expedite \nrehabilitation assistance ADB Guidelines for Procurement may be flexibly interpreted, including \nrelaxation  of  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  requirements.  In  accordance  with  this \nflexibility, procurement of equipment and materials, when the estimated contract cost exceeds \n$1.0 million should follow ICB procedures, with the bidding and evaluation period each reduced \nto 30 days. International shopping procedures will be followed for contracts between $0.5 million \nand  $1.0  million,  with  bidding  periods  reduced  to  7\u201315 days. For contracts  costing  the \nequivalent of  $0.5 million or less, local procedures will be followed, with invitation for bids \npublished in national newspapers and with bidding periods of 7 days and an evaluation time of \n15 days. Direct purchase procedures will be adopted for contracts up to $0.1 million, with award \nwithin 7 days.  \n \n75.  Civil  works  contracts  with  estimated  values  above  $5.0  million  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ICB procedures, with the bidding and evaluation period each reduced to 30 \ndays.  For  contracts  with  estimated  values  between  $0.5  million  and  $5.0  million,  local \ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB will be followed, with a bidding period of 15\u2013\n21 days and an evaluation period of 15\u201330 days. Invitations for bids will be published in at least \ntwo national newspapers of wide circulation to ensure adequate dissemination of information. \nFor small contracts up to $0.5 million, limited local competitive bidding will be carried out, with \n ", "24   \nbidding and evaluation reduced to 10 days. Postqualification or the registration system (for local \ncontractors) will be generally used. Prior review by ADB of invitations for bids and bidding \ndocuments will be required for procurement under ICB procedures. For international shopping, \npost-facto approval procedures will be followed. However, if during such post-facto reviews \nacceptable procedures are found to have not been followed, ADB will not finance the contract. If \nany grant funds have already been used, the Government will refund them to ADB.  \n \n76.  For small contracts of up to $30,000, community-based procurement may be allowed \nwhere appropriate, following procedures set out in the ADB Guide on Community Participation \nin  Procurement.  An  alternative  implementation  mode  will  be  to  tender  batches  of  a  few \nsubprojects or subprojects across selected project locations among private sector companies, \nNGOs, or foundations that can demonstrate organizational capacity. This procurement will \nfollow  procedures  set  out  in  ADB  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The administration of the \nlivelihood restoration support for affected families may be handled by organized community \ngroups, contractors, NGOs, or foundations that will provide support in the form of completed \ncore houses, equipment, building materials, or construction labor support. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n77.  The Government has agreed that all consultants will be engaged by ADB, in consultation \nwith the Government, in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Since the \nETESP will be completed in about 3 years, expeditious selection and fielding of the consultants \nwill  be  the  key  issue.  Where  possible,  simplified  procedures,  including  greater  delegated \nauthority to the Indonesia Resident Mission, will therefore be adopted. \n \n78.  Specifically,  the  following  flexible  modalities  will  be  adopted  for  the  selection  of \nconsultants:  (i)  all  individual  consultants  will  be  selected  on  a  direct-selection  basis;  (ii) \nconsulting service packages of less than $2 million value will be procured through bio-data \nproposals using the quality- and cost-based selection method, with a proposal submission \nperiod of 21 days; and (iii) consulting service packages valued at more than $2 million will be \nprocured through simplified technical proposals using  the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod with a proposal submission period of 28 days. Consulting services for sector technical \nneeds will be procured in sector-specific packages. The detailed cost estimates by sector, which \nalso include consulting needs, are in Appendix 3. \n \n6.  Advance Action \n79.  Given the emergency needs, ADB has approved advance action for the procurement of \ngoods, services, and works, and the recruitment of consultants, provided this has taken place \non or after 5 January 2005. The Government has been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of such \nadvance action will not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n80.  Timely disbursements and efficient flow of funds are essential for effective emergency \nassistance. The Ministry of Finance has prepared the organizational arrangements to guide the \nflow of funds. It has established a set of  special tsunami reconstruction accounts  at Bank \nIndonesia in various currencies, into which all donor proceeds from the MDTF will be directed. \nThe Ministry of Finance will also establish a special treasury office in Aceh, supported by a grant \nfrom the ETESP (para. 61), which will act as the central channeling agent to interface between ", "    25 \nthe central Government and all line ministries, provincial and local governments, and BKP. A \nproject-specific imprest account will be established in Bank Indonesia. It will be maintained and \nmonitored by BKP, with support provided by the PMO. Line ministries will be given access to \nsubaccounts  of  this  imprest  account  so  that  they  can  use  the  funds  for  subproject \nimplementation. \n \n81.  The bulk of the transactions are expected to be paid for out of the imprest account, with \ndirect payments made only for some large contracts. The imprest account will have a ceiling of \n$29 million. It will be replenished based on the liquidation and the actual uses of funds by the \nend beneficiaries. Statement of expenditure procedures will be allowed for transactions below \n$100,000 provided the appropriate conditions for the use of the procedures are satisfied. This \nwill  greatly  facilitate  the  speed  of  disbursements.  Disbursement  will  follow  the  guidelines \nestablished in the ADB Disbursement Handbook, June 2001. \n \n8.  Retroactive Financing \n82.  The ETESP provides for retroactive financing of immediate importations, rehabilitation of \nkey infrastructure and facilities, and provision of services and grants. ADB has agreed to allow \nretroactive  financing  of  up  to  30%  of  the  respective  ETESP  components  for  eligible \nexpenditures incurred  under the ETESP before its effectivity, but  not earlier than 5 January \n2005, provided that the budget for the expenditures has been approved by ADB and the \nexpenditures have been incurred in accordance with agreed procurement procedures. ADB \nreserves the right not to approve any expenditures, if they have not been incurred in accordance \nwith the agreed procurement procedures, ADB safeguard policies or if they are not in line with \nthe objective and scope of the ETESP. The Government has been advised that provision of \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project. \n \n9.  Financial Management, Accounts, Audit, and Reports \na.  Financial Management \n83.  The EMS and its extension office in Banda Aceh, ETESP sector consultants, and \nperiodic review missions will closely monitor compliance with ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements to \nensure quality control, speedy implementation of subprojects, and rapid assistance to BKP on \nproject  implementation  matters.  They  will  also  closely  monitor  anticorruption  measures \nundertaken by BKP and PMO, carry out random and spot checks on procurement and accounts \nof  the  ETESP  and  subprojects,  and  inspect  the  rehabilitated  facilities.  The  anticorruption \nmeasures adopted under the ETESP include (i) strict financial management with strengthened \ngovernment monitoring and  independent monitoring by the consultants, (ii) use of detailed \nsubproject selection criteria, (iii) strong project supervision with appropriate consultant input, (iv) \nregular independent performance auditing, and (v) random and independent spot checks by the \nEMS and review missions. \n \nb.  Accounts, Record Keeping, and Audit \n84.  Guidelines  for  accounting  and  record  keeping  will  be  established  by  the  PMO in \naccordance with sound accounting principles. The PMO and PMUs  will maintain separate \nrecords and accounts for each subproject. The records will be adequate to identify the goods \nand services financed by the ETESP, together with appropriate supporting documentation. The \nrecords and supporting documentation will be made available for any audits conducted on \nproject activities. \n ", "26   \n \n85.  Three main types of external audit activities\u2014financial, procurement, and operational\u2014\nwill be carried out by external auditors acceptable to ADB. These audits will be supervised by \nBPK in coordination with the PMO. Where necessary, BPK will hire appropriately qualified \nauditors from the private sector to assist. BPK will also utilize the reports from the internal \nauditors at the local level of government (Bawasdas) and the inspectors general of the central \nGovernment. For subproject activities, the PMUs will coordinate the internal audit and will \nensure that the internal audit reports are provided to the PMO, BPK, and ADB. The PMO will \nestablish the internal audit guidelines as part of the overall fiduciary framework for the ETESP. \n \n86.  For external audit, as a minimum, annual financial audits  will be conducted for the \nconsolidated  project  accounts  and  individual  subproject  financial  accounts.  The  latter  will \ninclude an audit of the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures. \nThe audit reports and related financial statements in English will be submitted to ADB not later \nthan 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. A separate opinion on the use \nof the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures will be included in the auditor\u2019s \nreport. In addition, procurement audits will ensure that procurement undertaken followed the \nagreed procedures. Finally, operational audits will  review the efficiency of project activities, \nensure transparency, and provide an objective and independent assessment of such activities. \n \n87.  To  ensure  the  effective  implementation  of  the  Asian  Tsunami  Fund  proceeds,  the \nprocurement and operational performance audits will be conducted both annually and randomly \nduring implementation as required. Reports will be submitted to BKP and ADB within 3 months \nof the completion of the random audits and within 6 months of the end of the financial year for \nthe annual audits. \n \nc.  Reporting \n88.  Reporting  structures  and  arrangements  for  BKP  are  being  finalized.  Following  the \nannouncement on BKP\u2019s detailed structure, reporting links between PMU, BKP, EMS, and ADB \nwill be established.  The PMO will prepare brief monthly progress reports, in a format to be \nagreed between the Government and ADB, and submit these to BKP and ADB. In addition, the \nPMO will submit quarterly reports to BKP and ADB. Within 6 months of ETESP completion, the \nGovernment will provide ADB, through BAPPENAS/BKP, an overall project completion report \nproviding detailed evaluation of project design, costs, contractor and consultant performance, \nsocial and economic impact, and other details as requested by ADB. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n89.  The BKP, with support through the PMO, will carry out project performance monitoring \nand evaluation in accordance with  the ADB Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \nHandbook. Baseline indicators and targets for each sector and subproject will be developed \nprior to implementation for monitoring purposes as well as for checking against selection \ncriteria. Given the ETESP\u2019s emergency assistance nature, flexibility will be used in performance \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n \n11.  Project Review \n90.  Throughout implementation, ADB will conduct regular reviews supplemented by sector \nspecialists (every month during the first 8 months; and at least once every 2 months thereafter). \nThe EMS will be the anchor for this process. Given the high frequency of these reviews and the ", "    27 \nrelatively short implementation period, no midterm review will be conducted, unless deemed \nnecessary by ADB and the Government. \n \nIV.  CONTRIBUTION TO THE MULTIDONOR TRUST FUND \n \n91.   To ensure that the synergies between ADB\u2019s support and the projects and plans of other \ndonors are fully exploited, it is proposed that ADB contribute $10 million to the MDTF. A number \nof donors are expected to participate in the MDTF, with principal contributions expected to come \nfrom the European Union and the Government of Netherlands. Overall, about $500 million is to \nbe channeled through MDTF. The World Bank in its capacity as the trustee will co-chair the \nsteering committee of the MDTF. The MDTF is to provide a financing mechanism for pooling \nsmaller bilateral contributors to ensure that as much support is channeled through the budget as \npossible, and to provide close coordination of DMRR planning and implementation.  \n \n92.  The  proposed  contribution  will  allow  ADB  to  participate  in  the  MDTF,  including  (i) \nmembership in the MDTF steering committee (comprising representatives of the Government \n(through BKP), principal donors, and civil society members), which will be responsible for \nendorsing  guidelines  and  procedures,  and  coordinating  and  approving  subprojects  in \naccordance with DMRR needs; (ii) sharing of information and agreeing on common approaches \nrelating to design and implementation of subprojects under the MDTF and ADB emergency \nsupport, including the ETESP, thus avoiding duplication of activities; and (iii) opportunities for \nADB to cofinance MDTF programs and for the MDTF to cofinance ADB subprojects, depending \non comparative advantage, sector knowledge, and skills base.  \n \n93.  Subject to Board approval, ADB will enter into a Memorandum of Understanding with the \nGovernment and the World Bank, and a  Contribution Agreement with the World Bank. The \nterms and conditions of the Memorandum of Understanding and the Contribution Agreement are \nbeing formulated by ADB and the World Bank. The quarterly progress report to the Board on the \nutilization of the Asian Tsunami Fund will provide information to the Board on progress in the \nutilization of MDTF and ADB\u2019s role in the MDTF. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits \n94.  The  subprojects  will  be  selected  on  the  basis  of  their  technical  feasibility,  cost-\neffectiveness, and contribution to the economic revival process in the affected regions. Given \nthe total destruction in many areas, any support is likely to bring significant incremental benefits \nto the affected population. The subprojects under theme 1, anchored on livelihood restoration, \nwill bring significant direct benefits through immediate opportunities in agriculture and fisheries, \nsectors that account for over 60% of labor force participation in Aceh. Support for the restoration \nof  housing  assets  will  also  have  beneficial  economic  and  social  outcomes.  By  providing \nessential public services and rebuilding infrastructure, the subprojects under theme 2 will have \nmajor direct and indirect impacts on economic revival. \n \nB.  Poverty and Other Impacts \n95.  Poverty Impact. By contributing to economic revival and livelihood restoration, the \nETESP  will  have  significant  beneficial  impacts  on  the  poor.  In  particular,  the  targeting \nmechanisms used will ensure that the poor and vulnerable, including those with inadequate \n ", "28   \nskills, derive adequate support through the subprojects. A summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy, and a gender action plan are in Appendix 8.11 \n \n96.  Environmental Impact. This is a category B project. An overall initial environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  was  undertaken  to  assess  generic  impacts  of  each  project  component \n(Appendix 5). The IEE shows that the  ETESP will have a  significant positive impact on the \nenvironment, including rehabilitating the damaged coastal zones, mangroves, and coral reefs; \nreviving agricultural productivity; and reducing health risks by rehabilitating damaged water \nsupply and sanitation facilities. In addition, spatial planning and environmental management, as \na project component, will promote mainstreaming of environmental considerations into the \nplanning process. The IEE also shows that none of the interventions under the ETESP, at this \nstage of design, is anticipated to create any significant adverse impact on the environment, and \nthat the potential negative impact in a limited number of cases will be localized, short-term, and \ncan be mitigated. Given the emergency nature of the Project, subproject-specific IEEs were not \nprepared,  but  will  be  developed  prior  to  physical  construction  of  the  subprojects.  An \nenvironmental assessment and review procedure is prepared as part of the IEE (Appendix 5), to \nguide the environmental assessment of subprojects and facilitate institutional arrangements and \ncompliance with environmental requirements of Indonesia and ADB. \n \n97.  Resettlement Issues. Since the disaster has led to significant changes in the coastline, \nthe DMRR strategy envisages a large-scale spatial planning initiative, part of which will be \nsupported by the ETESP. The more than 400,000 internally displaced people pose substantial \nchallenges  for  the  provision  of  shelter  and  livelihood  opportunities  to  the  homeless  and \norphaned, who are now temporarily living in public shelters or with relatives and host families. \nSocial strains are already evident. The Government\u2019s current plan includes realignment of the \ncoastline, at least in densely populated coastal regions. Civil society consultations are under \nway to  disseminate the Government\u2019s plan. While the Government would prefer decisions \nbased  on  consensus  with  community  councils  and  leaders  in  Aceh,  some  involuntary \nresettlement may be necessary. The ETESP adopts a pragmatic phased approach dealing first \nwith urgent needs in the areas with low to medium devastation and allowing time for in-depth \nspatial, environmental, and other related assessments to be carried out prior to designing the \nsubproject interventions under  phase 2. Most of the rehabilitation and reconstruction works \nunder  the  ETESP  are  likely  to  take  place  where  the  destroyed  or  damaged  facilities  or \ninfrastructure  were  originally  located.  Even  in  the  case  of  housing,  a  sector  where  land \nownership issues are likely to arise, efforts will be made to minimize involuntary resettlement. \nMost subprojects are unlikely to trigger resettlement safeguards. However, in the event any \nsubproject activity does trigger such safeguards, BKP and the concerned IA will prepare an \nappropriate  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  Resettlement  Framework \n(Appendix 6) and submit it to ADB for review and approval before awarding contracts. \n \nC.  Risks \n98.  ETESP implementation involves three major risks. The first relates to the history of \nconflicts in Aceh. The tsunami tragedy has provided a small window of opportunity for both the \nGovernment and the Free Aceh Movement to discuss the future of Aceh. An interim truce has \nbeen declared, and peace talks aimed at longer-term resolution have been initiated in Helsinki. \nAt the same time, reports of armed conflict and skirmishes continue. Years of hostility may take \nsignificant efforts and goodwill on both sides to be resolved. ADB\u2019s past projects have faced \nmajor implementation hurdles in Aceh due to the continuing conflicts. The mitigating factor is the \n                                                 \n11  Supplementary Appendix E presents a detailed social and poverty impact assessment of the tsunami disaster. ", "    29 \nlevel of seriousness and commitment that the Government has shown in (i) providing relief and \nhumanitarian assistance and its coordination,  (ii) preparing the DMRR strategy, (iii)  being \nsensitive to the need for involvement of Acehnese, and (iv) mobilizing donor commitments. The \nDMRR strategy lays out a multiyear implementation framework, and indications are strong that \nthe line ministries in a number of key sectors will use the DMRR support as an opportunity to \nelevate the quality of public services in Aceh over and beyond the predisaster situation. Such \ngenuine development initiatives are expected to facilitate resumption of normalcy. \n \n99.  The ETESP design deals with the conflict risk  by recognizing that the  reconstruction \neffort must be fully participatory. Conflict experience elsewhere in Indonesia demonstrates the \nimportance of thorough communication and consultations, prior to implementation. To restore \nhope for the future and dignity, people must be given control over their lives. To restore trust of \nlocal institutions, and nurture satisfaction with the reconstruction program, affected people need \nroom  to  participate  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  the  reconstruction  programs. \nConsultations  with  the  community  leaders  (formal  and  informal),  local  academics,  and \ngrassroots institutions are first steps in that direction, as they provide an avenue for public \nparticipation and awareness, and lead to programs that meet people\u2019s needs and aspirations. At \nthe same time, care must be taken not to raise expectations about programs and assistance \nthat may not materialize. The opportunities for participation must be well researched and \nplanned to ensure that the issues raised are representative for all segments in the affected \ncommunities. \n100.  The second major risk relates to the lack of capacity at the local government levels in \nimplementing development programs and projects. The disaster, through loss of lives of scores \nof civil servants, has aggravated the already weak local capacity. The central Government has \nthus far filled the gap by sending teams of experts to deliver essential public services in the \nworst affected areas. The ETESP recognizes these serious problems. The capacity risk will be \nmitigated  by  including  capacity-building  support  for  local  governments  in  all  sector  and \nsubproject interventions, and providing adequate consulting support for project management \nand implementation.  \n101.  The third major risk relates to coherence of implementation of the Government\u2019s DMRR \nstrategy and donor coordination.  ADB assistance will be delivered in an arena with many \norganizations with different targets, programs, and packages of assistance. In addition, the \nmultiple needs of reconstruction have different but overlapping targets: regional, sector, and \nindividual. Ideally, the DMRR strategy and its future revisions should set out the principles for \ntargeting the various schemes proposed. Without coherent principles and criteria, reconstruction \nassistance may induce conflicts. Similarly, the detailed planning of assistance from ADB and \nother donors and their eligibility criteria should be in line with whatever criteria are established \nby the Government, validated by the affected people, and well publicized. The flexible design of \nthe ETESP mitigates the risks under this category, by formulating the sector interventions in two \nphases, to allow for time and consultations with the central and local governments and donors. \nThe subproject proposals will pass through a comprehensive assessment process, including in-\ndepth consultations with all the relevant and major institutions concerned. \n102.  In addition, segregation of women and the persistence of gender-based discriminatory \npractices in Aceh may affect the ETESP\u2019s ability to identify the specific needs and vulnerabilities \nof women, especially widows and female heads of households, in order to formulate adequate \nresponse. To mitigate this risk, ETESP components will support community organizations, \nincluding  women\u2019s  grassroots  organizations  and  networks,  to  participate  in  local  decision-\n ", "30   \nmaking  to  ensure  that  their  perspectives  are  included  in  mainstream  rehabilitation  and \nreconstruction efforts. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n103.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that the  executing agency  arrangements for  the \nETESP  will  be  transferred  from  BAPPENAS  to  BKP  immediately  after  the \nestablishment of BKP. \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that the PMO and PMUs are established with full \ncoordination, structural and reporting arrangements with the Executing Agency \noutlined, immediately following the establishment of the BKP. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that all subprojects meet, to the satisfaction of ADB, \nthe  agreed  selection  criteria  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  that  all \nsubprojects are properly monitored to the satisfaction of ADB.  \n(iv)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  cash  and  in-kind  assistance  provided  to \nindividual beneficiaries  under the Project will be against suitable identification \nand verification in accordance with arrangements agreed between ADB and the \nGovernment; all records, receipts, certificates, and other documents related to \nthe cash and in-kind assistance will be properly maintained and made available \nto ADB at any time; and in case of support on a retroactive basis, the concerned \nline ministries, agencies, or local governments will produce clear documentation \non  the  policies  adopted,  mechanisms  for  delivery  of  support,  and  the \nidentification process. \n(v)  The Government will ensure that BKP and each of the line ministries (the IAs) will \nactively seek community participation in the subproject design, implementation, \noperation, and maintenance of all works carried out under the Project. The \nGovernment, through BKP and the IAs will engage, to the extent possible, civil \nsociety organizations (CSOs) and NGOs for subproject implementation as well \nas  monitoring.  Further,  to  ensure  integrity  of  CSOs/NGOs  and  to  prevent \ncollusive relations, all CSOs/NGOs engaged under the Project will be required to \npublish information about their activities and use of funds and will be subject to \naudit. This information will be placed on a website.  \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that adequate environmental mitigation measures in \naccordance with (a) the Government\u2019s environmental laws and regulations and \n(b) ADB Environment Policy (2002) are incorporated into all subproject designs \nand implementation. The Government will ensure that the agreed environmental \nassessment and review procedures are complied with.  \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that the relocation of the displaced persons will be \ncompleted as per the Government\u2019s policy framework and procedural guidelines \napplicable to the Project, which are outlined in the agreed LARPFPG.  \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that, to the extent possible, subprojects will avoid \ninvoluntary resettlement. In the event involuntary resettlement is required for any \nsubproject, then the Government will prepare a land acquisition and resettlement \nplan in accordance with the Government\u2019s applicable laws and regulations, ADB \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and the agreed LARPFPG. In case of \ndiscrepancies between the Government's laws, regulations, and procedures and \nADB's requirements, ADB's requirements  will apply. The Land Acquisition and \nResettlement Plan for a subproject will be submitted to and approved by ADB ", "    31 \nprior to the award of a civil works contract for that subproject. The Resettlement \nPlan will be disclosed to  people affected, and project reporting will provide \ninformation on resettlement. Further, the Government will ensure that the agreed \nLARPFPG and Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan are strictly complied \nwith.  \n(ix)  The Government will ensure that all land acquisition and resettlement activities \nhave been completed before disbursement to subprojects. No civil works  will \ncommence in any area prior to completion of all approved resettlement and \nincome restoration activities in that area. \n(x)  The Government will ensure that to safeguard the interest of indigenous peoples, \nmeasures are undertaken to promote full participation of indigenous peoples in \nthe Project. Subproject activities will be carried out in accordance with the ADB \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples and in accordance with the Indigenous Peoples \nDevelopment Framework, which has been agreed by the Government and ADB.  \n(xi)  The Government will ensure that, in accordance with ADB Policy on Gender and \nDevelopment (1998), (a) adequate resources are provided to implement  the \ngender action plan developed for  the ETESP and included in Appendix 8; (b) \nproject interventions take into account the different impacts and needs of women \nand  men;  (c)  special  features  are  built  into  subprojects  to  facilitate  and \nencourage women\u2019s participation and to ensure tangible benefits to women; (d) \nadequate representation is given to women in decision-making processes and \nstructures for post-tsunami rehabilitation and reconstruction; (e) project reporting \nreflects gender-specific issues and gender-disaggregated data, where applicable; \nand (f) women will be eligible for equal opportunities and pay generated under \nthe ETESP.  \n(xii)  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to conduct spot audits at any time during \nproject implementation to determine the degree to which project funds have been \neffectively  and  efficiently  utilized  to  implement  the  ETESP and achieve its \nobjectives, outputs, and performance indicators. ADB also reserves the right to \ninvestigate any possible financial or management impropriety in conducting the \nETESP. The Government  will cooperate with any such audit and investigation \nand extend necessary assistance, including access to all relevant books and \nrecords, as well as engagement of independent auditors and experts who may \nbe needed for satisfactory completion of such audits and investigations. All \nexternal costs related to the audits and investigations  will be borne by  the \nETESP.  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  conduct  a  \u201cspecial  audit\u201d  focusing  on \ngovernance;  financial  accountability  (e.g.,  certification  of  accounts);  and \ntransparency soon after completion of the ETESP. \n(xiii)  The  Government,  through  the  PMO  and  PMUs  will,  make  available  on  the \nwebsite for the  ETESP information on  how the funds are being used for the \nintended beneficiaries following applicable procedures. The website will present \nfinancial  statements  and  track  procurement  contract  awards,  and  include \ninformation  on,  among  others,  the  list  of  participating  bidders,  name  of  the \nwinning bidder, basic details on bidding procedures adopted, amount of the \ncontract awarded, the list of goods and/or services purchased, and their intended \nand actual utilization.  \n(xiv)  The Government will immediately put in place mechanisms to deal with citizen \ngrievance against anyone taking advantage of the situation, as well as alternative \ndispute resolution mechanisms to settle private disputes. To that end, within 3 \nmonths of the effective date, the Government will establish a grievance review \n ", "32   \nand resolution mechanism within BKP. The grievance review and resolution \nmechanism will be responsible for (a) reviewing and addressing grievances of \nany citizen, beneficiaries, and other stakeholders of the  ETESP, in relation to \neither the Project, any of the service providers, or any person responsible for \ncarrying out any aspect of the ETESP; and (b) establishing the threshold criteria \nand procedures for handling such grievances, for proactively and constructively \nresponding to them, and for providing the public with notice of such mechanism, \nincluding publishing notices in newspapers. Such criteria and procedures will be \nsubject to ADB\u2019s approval. The supervisory board (Badan Pengawas) of BKP will \nbe responsible for the mechanism and a dedicated full-time professional staff of \nBKP will be appointed. This staff will report directly to the head of the supervisory \nboard of BKP, who in turn will report directly to the chief of BKP. This grievance \nreview and resolution mechanism will be made public and a facilitation unit will \nbe established. The facilitation unit will be established in coordination with CSOs \nand/or NGOs. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n104.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the following: \n \n(i)  the  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $290,000,000  to  the  Republic  of \nIndonesia, from the Asian Tsunami Fund, provided that any withdrawal in excess \nof $145,000,000 shall be subject to the availability of the Asian Tsunami Fund \nresources, for the  Earthquake and Tsunami Emergency Support Project, on \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Grant Agreement presented to the Board; and  \n \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $3,500,000 \nto the Republic of Indonesia to strengthen the Fiduciary Oversight on Disaster \nManagement Rehabilitation and Reconstruction in Aceh and North Sumatra to be \nprovided by the Government of Netherlands. \n \n105.

Livelihood Support  \n \n1.  Agriculture \na.  Scope \n1.  The agriculture component will cover about 11 affected districts in the Aceh and North \nSumatra provinces. The first phase districts (Aceh Besar, Aceh Utara, Bireuen, Nias, and Pidie) \nwill include those where the majority of the communities in the affected areas are intact and the \ndistrict implementation capacities are not severely affected. The second phase will focus on \ndistricts where sizable damage has occurred, but need preparatory activities such as restoration \nof accessibility, spatial planning, return of communities from the refugee camps, and restoration \nof some implementation capacity (Aceh  Barat,  Aceh  Barat  Daya,  Aceh  Jaya,  Aceh  Timur, \nNagan Raya, and Simelue). \n \n2.  Restoration of Support Services. The impact of the tsunami on the agricultural support \nservices has been extensive with the loss of trained staff and damage to facilities, equipment, \nand vehicles. To help the recovery of farming, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will support \nagriculture-related human resources and institutional development of district and provincial \ngovernments in the project area. Drawing on previous ADB and other assisted projects in the \ncountry, the component will help to (i) introduce extension methodologies, such as participatory \nfarmer  field  schools  and  farmer  driven  research,  which  have  proven  to  be  effective  in \ntransferring technology to farmers, and (ii) facilitate speedy recovery of farming practice. \n \n3.  The  activities  include  (i)  capacity-building  of  institutions  and  human  resources;  (ii) \nrecruitment of agricultural graduates, preferably belonging to the affected areas, on contractual \nbasis that may later be absorbed by the district and provincial governments into their regular \ncadres;  (iii)  training  of  250  new  and  350  existing  staff  in  the  participatory  extension \nmethodologies, land-use planning, crop production, and remedial measures for salinization and \nother tsunami-related issues; and (iv) rehabilitation of key agricultural facilities, and provision of \nnecessary equipment and vehicles. \n \n4.  Community Empowerment. Experience with past and ongoing projects is that the \nformation  and  development  of  self-help  groups  is  highly  effective  in  building  coherent \ncommunities and enabling community members to rise out of poverty. In select areas, the \ncomponent will support working with community members to revive the communities and build \ntheir capacities to undertake the recovery process with community participation. The community \nneeds and capabilities will be assessed at the initial stages to provide a basis for targeting \ninterventions. Revival and empowerment of the communities into self-help groups will also help \nthe communities access reconstruction initiatives offered by the Government or other donors.  \n \n5.  The component will (i) develop 2,000 self-help groups, (ii) build the capacity of 4,000 \ncommunity members in community management skills,; (iii) develop participatory land and asset \nownership mapping, (iv) undertake a needs and capability assessment, (v) establish community \nmicrofinance services,  (vi)  provide  training  in  alternate  income  generation  skills,  and  (vii) \nsupport communities to reestablish land ownership records. The component will specifically \ntarget households headed by women and orphans to ensure that their interests are protected. \n \n6.  Restoration of Farming. Damage to farmland, supporting infrastructure, and farming \nassets has been extensive. Depending on the extent of damage, restoration of productive \nactivities to pre-tsunami levels may take from 6\u20138 months to 3\u20134 years. The component will \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \nprovide for studies to assess the extent of damage in different areas and develop different \nrestoration  strategies  for  different  levels  of  damage.  Less-affected  areas  may  require  the \nclearing of debris from farmland, and provision of basic tools, equipment, crop inputs, poultry, \nand small ruminants. Regions with moderate damage may require desalinization and soil \nimprovement measures, desiltation of farm irrigation and drainage channels, and introduction of \nsalt-tolerant crops/varieties. Regions sustaining heavy damage, in addition to the activities \nrequired for the less and moderate damage areas, may require land leveling, new field layouts, \nand realignment of irrigation and drainage infrastructure.  \n \n7.  The restoration strategies in the moderate and heavily damaged areas will need studies \nand close backstopping to initiate and guide the implementation, and monitor the progress. In \nparticular, close monitoring will be needed in monitoring the salinity levels in soil and water and \nin adaptability of salt tolerant crops to the local conditions. \n \n8.  The component will provide for (i) studies to profile the damage and development of \nrestoration strategies for different levels of damage; (ii) participatory land use planning in the \nsettlements represented by 2,000 self-help groups; (iii) training for 2,000 self-help groups in the \nproduction of field crops, tree crops, and horticulture crops; (iv) rehabilitation on 20,000 hectares \n(ha) of farmland; (v) soil improvement and desalinization on 6,000 ha of farmland; (vi) land \nleveling on 5,000 ha of severely damaged farmland; (vii) farmer-driven research; (viii) seed \nmultiplication for salt-tolerant crops and varieties; (ix) support for resumption of field crop \nproduction  on  15,000  ha;  (x)  community-based  nurseries  for  tree  crops;  (xi)  support  for \nimproving 15,000 ha of tree crops; (xii) support to 2,000 self-help group for poultry and small \nruminants; and (xiii) monitoring of soil improvement including salinity levels in the soil and water \nin the areas receiving moderate to heavy damage. \n \nb.  Cost Estimates \n9.  The estimated costs of the component are about $32.7 million equivalent (Table A2.1), \nof which $8.5 million represents foreign exchange costs and $24.2 million  equivalent local \ncurrency costs. ADB will provide $30 million to cover $8.5 million in foreign exchange and $21.5 \nmillion equivalent in local currency. The Government will finance the remaining $2.71 million \nequivalent. \n \nc.  Consulting Services \n10.  Consulting services, both international and domestic, will be required in the fields of \nhuman  resource  development,  participatory  extension  methodologies,  soil  science, \ndesalinization and soil improvement, land-use planning, community development, agronomy, \ntree crops, and civil engineering. The component will require 135 person-months of consulting \nservices:  60  international  and  100  domestic.

The second will focus on the \nremaining five districts (Aceh Barat, Aceh Utara, Bireuen, Kota Sabang, and Lhok Seumawe). \nThe component will comprise five subcomponents: (i) community empowerment and resource \nmanagement, (ii) restoration of capture fisheries, (iii) restoration of aquaculture facilities, (iv) \nrestoration of small-scale fisheries postharvest facilities, and (v) fisheries support services.  \n \n12.  Community Empowerment and Resource Management. Services of NGOs will be \ncontracted to assist  district governments in  organizing,  training,  and  empowering 100\u2013120 \naffected coastal villages for  rehabilitation work; livelihood restoration and development; and \nimplementation  of  site-specific  coastal  resource  rehabilitation  and  management  programs, \nincluding the rehabilitation and management of mangrove, coral reefs, and other habitats, and \nlaw enforcement.  \n \n13.  Restoration  of  Capture  Fisheries.  The  subcomponent  will  provide  technical  and \nfinancial support for production inputs to 10,000\u20132,000 affected small-scale fishers for repairing \nand restoring about 3,000 fishing boats, boat engines, and gear for recovery of fishing operation. \nInitial production inputs such as fuel, ice, and ice boxes will be provided. \n \n14.  Restoration of Aquaculture Facilities. The subcomponent will provide technical and \nfinancial  support  for  production  inputs  to  1,500\u20132,000  affected  small-scale fish farmers  to \nrehabilitate about 3,000 hectares of fishponds in major aquaculture districts. Initial production \ninputs such as fertilizer, seedlings, and harvest equipment will be provided. \n \n15.  Restoration of Small-Scale Fisheries Postharvest Facilities. The subcomponent will \nprovide technical and financial support to 80 affected coastal communities for rehabilitation of 12 \nfish-landing sites, including jetties, fish processing areas, auction halls, cold storage, access \nroads, water supply, and drainage systems.  \n \n ", "40  Appendix 2 \n16.  Fisheries  Support  Services.  The subcomponent  will  (i) restore damaged regional \nfisheries service facilities, including offices, laboratories, training centers, and research and \nextension  facilities;  (ii)  strengthen  technical  extension  services  for  producing  quality  seed, \npostharvest handling, processing, and marketing of fish products in partnership with the private \nsector; (iii) facilitate access of fish farmers and fishers to various forms of financial assistance; \nand (iv) resume research and extension services. \n \nb.  Cost Estimates \n \n17.  The total cost of the component is estimated at $33.29 million equivalent (Table A2.2), of \nwhich $10 million represents direct and indirect foreign exchange costs and $23.3 million \nequivalent local currency costs. ADB will finance $10 million of the foreign exchange costs and \n$20 million equivalent of the local currency costs. The Government will finance $3.29 million \nequivalent. \n \nTable A2.2: Cost Estimates for the Fisheries Subcomponent  \n($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total   \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Phase I  Phase II \nCommunity Mobilization  0.28  0.82  1.10  0.54  0.56 \nTraining  0.60  1.79  2.39  1.19  1.20 \nTrials and Demonstrations  0.06  0.16  0.22  0.09  0.13 \nStudies and Assessments  0.23  0.70  0.93  0.46  0.47 \nBoats and Vehicles  3.76  3.13  6.89  3.10  3.79 \nEquipment and Materials  1.61  5.49  7.10  3.36  3.74 \nCivil Works            \n    Facilities  1.07  3.66  4.73  2.62  2.11 \n    Fishpond Rehabilitation  1.70  5.78  7.48  3.57  3.91 \nConsulting Services  0.65  0.75  1.40  0.70  0.70 \nImplementation and           \nSupervision  0.04  1.01  1.05  0.52  0.53 \nTotal  10.00  23.29  33.29  16.15  17.14 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nc.  Consulting Services  \n18.  The component requires consulting services (project management, capture fisheries, \naquaculture,  social  development,  environment  specialists,  economists,  and  fisheries \ninfrastructure engineers) to support project management and conduct detailed technical and \nenvironmental assessments and design for rehabilitation activities.  \n \n19.  Training, social preparation and community empowerment, and database development \nwill be contracted to qualified NGOs, local academic/research institutions and consulting firms in \naccordance with competitive selection criteria and procedures acceptable to ADB. Contracted \nNGOs will have extensive experience in coastal fishing community development and coastal \nnatural resource management.1  \n \n                                                 \n1  NGOs will be selected based on detailed evaluation criteria, including (i) geographic experience, (ii) work \nexperience, (iii) technical capacity, (iv) recognition, (v) gender orientation and experience in applying participatory \napproaches, and (vi) ethical practices. Preference will be given to local NGOs. NGOs outside of affected areas \ncould be engaged under the component in case of insufficient number of qualified local NGOs. \n ", "  Appendix 2  41 \n3.  Microenterprises  \na.  Damage and Impact \n20.  Enterprises in Aceh. Aceh\u2019s economy was dominated mainly by family-owned firms, \nmany small and most operating outside the formal economy. Most Acehnese households relied \non agriculture or fishing as their main source of income. According to the national statistics \nservice, only 65 establishments classified as medium or large-sized firms were operating in \n2002. The statistics service\u2019s 2002 survey on small informal business estimated that Aceh had \n187,996 micro and small enterprises, each employing an average of 1.8 people. About 80,000 \nof these businesses have been lost, generating job losses of approximately 140,000.  \n \n21.  Financial Sector of Aceh. Prior to the disaster, the financial sector comprised mainly \ncommercial  banks,  a  provincial  development  bank  (Bank  BPD  Aceh),  and  small  financial \ninstitutions, most notably 20 rural development banks (BPRs). In the provincial capital of Banda \nAceh, 10 commercial banks were operating, including Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), Bank \nMandiri, and Bank Danamon. Some half dozen insurance companies operating in Aceh, served \nmainly larger businesses. BRI (130 offices) and Bank BPD Aceh (38 offices) had extensive \noperations outside of Banda Aceh and these two banks accounted for 73% of the provincial \ncredit outstanding, which amounted to approximately Rp2.6 trillion ($339 million).2 Prior to the \ntsunami,  BPD  Aceh  had  a  loan  portfolio  of  slightly  more  than  Rp1  trillion  ($122  million) \nrepresenting more than 39% of total lending within Aceh. State and privately owned banks \ncombined accounted for Rp1.8 billion in loans ($213 million), about 63% of total Aceh lending. \nBRI, with $126 million3 in total loans, had the largest share. BPRs\u2019 combined lending of Rp35 \nbillion ($4.1 million), amounted to 1.2% of total Aceh credit.  \n \n22.  Half of commercial bank loans outstanding as of 26 December 2004 in Aceh equivalent \nto $100 million are subject to write-off, though this figure will ultimately be adjusted downward, \nas credit life insurance was widely in use. Infrastructure losses and damage to records are \nestimated  as  high  as  Rp130  billion.  Six  BPRs  have  been  completely  wiped  out:  offices \ndestroyed along with records, high staff casualties, and devastation to their service area. \nCumulative losses of BPRs and BPD is about 50% of their portfolios and greater than their \ncombined capital. Both the local BPRs and the BPD lack back-up lines of credit or liquidity \nfacilities that they could draw on to restart lending operations. The BPRs are in a difficult \nsituation, as their deposits are being drawn down by customers. Only the BPD has resumed \nlending on any scale. BRI has not yet resumed normal lending and has declared a \u201crepayment \nholiday\u201d to be in effect through the end of March. Most enterprise borrowers are unlikely to \nbegin  repaying  until  BRI  has  worked out restructuring/refinance plans with them. BRI has \nannounced that it expects to write off Rp400 billion ($47 million), equivalent to virtually the entire \ncombined portfolios of three BRI branches (and the units they supervise) destroyed. \n \n23.  Community-Based  Microfinance.  Relatively  few  community-based  microfinance \ninstitutions4 existed in the tsunami-affected areas, and these appear to have been largely wiped \nout. Prior to the disaster, low cash and capital reserves, geographic concentration, and often, \ninadequate support and supervision worked against the development of grassroots institutions. \nADB will support establishment of new grassroots microfinance institutions (MFIs), which will \nrequire  sustained  technical  assistance  for  capacity  building.  Post-tsunami,  however, \ncompassion could interfere with the establishment of sustainable grassroots institutions: soft \n                                                 \n2   All figures are for 30 September 2004, provided by Bank Indonesia to the ADB mission 2\u20133 March 2005. \n3   Figure is an extrapolation from BI data. More complete figures have been requested from BRI. \n4   No reliable statistics are available documenting the various village savings and credit associations and funds that \nwere operating, some under the auspices of imams, others of local government leaders. A seed capital grant has \nbeen approved from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction to undertake a survey and evaluation of these MFIs.  \n ", "42  Appendix 2 \nloans and grants, poisonous to institutional sustainability, are often mentioned as appropriate \n\u201cproducts\u201d for community MFIs to distribute. The damage and loss assessment was quite clear \nabout the need to avoid using MFIs\u2014or any formal financial institution for that matter\u2014as \nconduits  for  subsidized  lending  or  grants.  ADB  has  fully  supported  this  approach,  also \nadvocated by Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, which just released a set of principles to \nguide  microfinance  operations  under  crisis  conditions.  In  contributions  to  working  group \ndiscussion with the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), ADB has urged that \ngrants be provided to individuals and microenterprises; this is the most useful and immediately \npractical way to provide the means to restore income-generating assets. Financial support for \nmicro, small, and medium-size enterprises should, therefore, include grants. The key issue is \nhow to create a mechanism to distribute grants efficiently and equitably. \n \n24.  At the same time, internally displaced people appear to have a strong nominal (though \nperhaps not always effective) demand for micro loans as a key part of restarting economic \nactivities. ADB proposes, via an accompanying Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction grant, to \nsupport the development of grassroots MFIs, e.g., savings and credit associations. These \nvillage-based MFIs will not play a large role in providing financial support initially for restoration \nmicro and small enterprises. In the medium to long run, however, as capacity is developed, their \nrole in supporting micro and small enterprises will grow. ADB has a unique opportunity to \ncombine efforts with other development partners to build these village-based MFIs, as well as to \nprovide  overall  technical  leadership.  Numerous  relief  agencies  operating  in  Aceh  have \nsignificant microfinance experience (including, World Vision, Save the Children, Mercy Corps, \nOxfam,  Catholic  Relief  Services),  but  less  scope  for  developing  projects  directly  with  the \ngovernment. A tremendous amount of grant resources controlled by these organizations are \navailable to pay for social intermediation and capacity building. ADB\u2019s role will be to provide the \nframework,  along  with  technical  assistance,  within  which  these  agencies  can  apply  best \npractices to microfinance.  \n \nb.  Scope \n25.  Support to Commercial Microfinance System. BPRs and other MFIs will be able to \nsecure funds for onlending to MSEs from a microfinance fund. Technical assistance to BPRs \nand  other  MFIs  will  be  provided  in  the  area  of  operations,  product  design,  financial \nmanagement, accounting, and auditing. Substantial assistance to a limited number of BPRs will \nlikely be forthcoming from Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit-Kreditanstalt \nf\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW-GTZ)5  and  ADB  will  also  support  surviving  BPRs,  as  many  have \nborrowed from ADB under the Microcredit Project.6 The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction grant \nproject will concentrate on developing village-based savings and credit associations and provide \ntechnical assistance for capacity building to these grassroots MFIs. Funding requirements of \nthese MFIs will be provided for via the microfinance fund, which will provide mainly short-term, \nbut in some cases also long-term, loans. The microfinance fund may also be made available to \nother  financial  providers  seeking  to  serve  micro  and  small  enterprises  with  microfinance \nproducts, including BPD.  \n \n26.  Innovation Fund. An innovation fund will provide long-term debt and/or equity for (i) \ndemonstrably viable financial institutions seeking to restore and expand their operations in the \nprovince  but  short  of  investment  capital,  or  (ii)  new  financial  institutions,  e.g.,  a  leasing \ncompany. This fund will support financial innovations, and promote investment in new financial \n                                                 \n5   BPR liquidity needs are estimated from Rp25 billion\u201340 billion ($2.8million\u20134.4 million). Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr \nTechnische Zusammenarbeit-Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW-GTZ), GTZ-KfW is proposing to provide E6 \nmillion for a project that would support 5 BPRs \n6   ADB. 1994.

Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 2  43 \nfirms. Some Sharia-based financial institutions are operating, though on a small scale; utilizing \nand expanding this risk-sharing financial modality appears worthwhile. Sharia leasing is a new \nconcept and appears to offer promise as a way of financing small-scale equipment leasing \nneeded  by  existing  and  new  micro,  small,  and  medium-size  enterprises.  Local  financial \ninstitutions that demonstrate fundamental soundness may be allowed to borrow longer term to \nfinance capital expenditures, including investments in new service technologies. \n \n27.  Creating  a  Technical  Support  Unit.  The  project  activities  will  be  managed  by  a \ntechnical support unit, comprising a team of financial experts, both local and international, \nsupported by highly experienced local administrative staff, including legal, accounting, and \nauditing experts. This team will provide technical assistance to financial institutions, and guide \nday-to-day activities of the microfinance fund and innovation fund. \n \nc.  Cost Estimates \n28.  Estimated component costs are about $21.30 million equivalent (Table A2.3), with $3.73 \nmillion representing direct foreign exchange costs and $17.57 million equivalent local currency \ncosts. ADB will finance $21 million equivalent comprising $3.73 million in foreign exchange and \n$17.27 million equivalent in local currency. The Implementing Agency will finance the remaining \n$0.30 million equivalent.  \n \nTable A2.3: Cost Estimates for the Micro and Small Enterprise Support Subcomponent  \n($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nMicrofinance Fund   0.0  5.00  5.00 \nInnovation Fund  0.0  10.0  10.00 \nTraining  1.50  0.0-  2.00 \nVehicles  0.05  0.09  0.14 \nComputers  0.05  0.0  0.05 \nConsulting Services  1.59  0.23  1.82 \nPPMS and Audits  0.54  0.52  1.06 \nImplementation and Supervision  -  1.23  1.23 \nTotal  3.73  17.57  21.30 \nPPMS = project performance monitoring system. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nd.  Consulting Services \n29.  Consulting services, both international and domestic, will be required in the fields of \nbank financial management, microfinance, leasing, accounting, auditing, and business law. The \ncomponent will require a total of 109 person-months of consulting services: 63 international and \n65 domestic.  \n \nB.  Social Services \n1.  Health \na.  Scope \n30.  The health component has two broad objectives: (i) improve access to basic health care \nfor the vulnerable and the underserved, and (ii) improve efficiency of the health delivery system. \nConcentrating on the population needs of remote and underserved districts where the most \n ", "44  Appendix 2 \nvulnerable reside, the component comprises four subcomponents focusing on strengthening (i) \nprimary health care, (ii) district health service delivery, and (iii) health management.   \n \n31.  Formulating a Strategic Plan. Before initiating the rehabilitation and reconstruction \nactivities, a strategic plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction of health services will provide \nguidance on effective approaches for health service delivery. The plan would address the most \nacute health needs, identifies challenges faced by the public sector, and assess strengths and \ncomplementary support offered by NGOs and the private sector. It will help the government \ndevelop a health system that demonstrates improved efficiency and effectiveness. A description \nof the three main subcomponents follows. \n \n32.  Strengthening Primary Health Care. The component will adopt various approaches to \nstrengthen facility-based and outreach services for primary health care, especially to reach the \ndisplaced and underserved population. The focus will be on districts where human capital loss is \nsevere. Different approaches (such as contracting of services) and involvement of community-\nbased organizations will be adopted to maximize the use of health personnel from the public \nand private sector, and from NGOs. In districts where human capital loss is not that severe, the \npublic sector's capacity for primary health care service provision will be augmented by deploying \ntrained  personnel.  The  component  will  rehabilitate  15\u201320  primary  health  care  facilities7  in \ncoastal and interior areas, and finance public health interventions that reduce the incidence of \ncommunicable  disease.  Outreach  activities  will  be  conducted  through  mobile  clinics,  and \nexisting community-based health service mechanisms will be supported. \n \n33.  Strengthening  District  Health  Service  Delivery.  The  component  will  develop  an \nintegrated provincial master plan to support an efficient and rationalized health service delivery \nnetwork. It will rehabilitate 2\u20133 district hospitals in Aceh Barat, Aceh Jaya, and Banda Aceh \nreequip them with essential health care packages, provide mobile logistical support, and build \nhuman resource capacity). The component will support short-term training for newly deployed \nstaff and help build capacity in continuing education and refresher training programs for existing \nhealth care personnel, especially for nurses and midwives. All staff working in the public and \nprivate health sectors will be eligible for these training programs. \n \n34.  Strengthening Health Management. The component will strengthen provincial and \ndistrict  health  sector  planning,  coordination,  and  management;  build  capacity  for  human \nresource  planning  and  development;  streamline  payment  and  risk-sharing  mechanisms  to \nsupport the poor, the underserved, and the displaced; improve budget management to allow for \nsufficient recurrent costs; and improve financial management and accounting systems. The \ncomponent will develop mechanisms to allow for public-private partnerships in service delivery, \ntraining, and monitoring. In addition, a district health monitoring system will be established for \nquality assurance, and independent third party monitoring and evaluation of health service \ndelivery will be initiated. \n \nb.  Cost Estimates \n35.  Of the estimated component cost of $25.3 million equivalent, foreign exchange costs \nrepresent $10.20 million and local currency costs $15.1 million equivalent. ADB will finance a \ntotal of $23 million comprising $10.2 million in foreign exchange and $12.8 million equivalent in \nlocal currency. The Government will finance the remaining $2.0 million equivalent. Table A2.4 \nprovides the cost estimates. \n \n                                                 \n7  The component will complement activities of decentralized health services, which will rehabilitate, reequip, and \nstrengthen human resource capacity at the \"puskesmas\" in the 10 tsunami-affected districts. \n ", "  Appendix 2  45 \n \nTable A2.4: Cost Estimates for the Health Subcomponent \n($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total   \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Phase I  Phase II \nTraining  0.20  0.80  1.00  0.50  0.50 \nAssessments, Studies, and  0.50  0.50  1.00  0.70  0.30 \nSystems Development  \nOperations and Consumables  0.40  1.50  1.90  1.00  0.90 \nEquipment and Materials  6.30  1.50  7.80  3.40  4.40 \nCivil Works   1.50  8.40  9.90  5.50  4.40 \nConsulting Services  1.30  0.70  2.00  1.20  0.80 \nProject Management  0.00  1.70  1.70  1.00  0.70 \nTotal  10.20  15.10  25.30  13.30  12.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \nc.  Implementation Arrangements for Consulting Services \n36.  MOH will recruit international and domestic consultants. Direct selection may be used for \nconsultants on an individual basis or through a firm. Overall, 15 international (75 person-\nmonths) and 30 domestic (150 person-months) consultants will be recruited, specializing in \nhealth  systems,  health  financing  and  management,  logistical  management,  information \nmanagement, human resource development, public health, maternal and child health, district \nhospitals, engineering, community development, and project implementation. The component \nwill carry out a wide range of provincial and district training programs, and identify potential \ntraining institutions for clinical practice training and management.  \n \n2.  Education and Skills Development \na.  Scope \n37.  The Project will cover repair and reconstruction of damaged infrastructure at all levels of \neducation, including furniture, equipment, and teaching materials; and training and salaries of \nnew teaching staff and education managers. The Project will also provide skills training to out-\nof-school youth to prepare them for entry into the labor market, and to adults who need \nretraining because they have lost their livelihood. The Project will provide $21 million in grant \nfunding.  \n \n38.  Reconstruction and Rehabilitation of Physical Facilities. Schools and madrasah that \nhave been destroyed or heavily damaged will be rebuilt or refurbished through the use of \ncontractors. Sites will be selected in consultation with district and central governments. Schools \nwith light damage will be given block grants to undertake the repairs or construction of individual \nclassrooms. The school/madrasah principal as chair of the school committee will be responsible \nfor  managing  the  rehabilitation  of  the  buildings  and  provision  of  furniture  according  to \ngovernment specifications. Provision will be made for the supply of lost or damaged teaching \nmaterials, including a basic set of textbooks, some supplementary and reference materials, and \nlost  or  damaged  equipment  (such  as  play  and  sports  equipment,  simple  science  and \nmathematics equipment, computers for students and the school administration, and industrial \nand vocational training equipment for the skills development courses and vocational schools).  \n  \n39.  Training of Teaching Staff and Education Managers. The replacement of school \nteachers is urgent to allow the resumption of normal schooling as quickly as possible. The \nsubcomponent will support  (i) redeployment of existing trained teachers to tsunami-affected \nareas on a voluntary basis for a specified period of time; (ii) recruitment of trained teachers who \n ", "46  Appendix 2 \nwere not previously working as teachers, on contract; (iii) recruitment and training of other \ngraduate professionals as teachers; and (iv) identification, recruitment, and training of local high \nschool  graduates  from  universities,  the  provincial  in-service  training  colleges,  district \ngovernments, or other private contractors as teachers.  \n \n40.  As the effective rehabilitation of schools and madrasah will require the presence of \npeople with management skills, the Project will support the development and provision of a \ntraining program for new principals and managers, offered through the universities, provincial \ntraining colleges, or other private contractors. The Project will also support salary and other \ncosts for contracted principals, to be recruited and appointed in accordance with standards \nestablished by the Ministry of National Education.  \n \n41.  Skills Development. Many people in Aceh have lost their jobs as a result of businesses, \nshops, and offices being wiped out or closing, or have lost their livelihoods through loss of land \nor means of productions (e.g., boats). Young people who are about to enter the labor market \nare unprepared for the current situation. To provide as many people as possible with access to \nemployment opportunities, the Project will support short nonformal and vocational training in \ncritical areas of skills development. Skill training is most likely to be needed in areas like \ncarpentry, welding, masonry, and electrical installation; and in fields appropriate for setting up \nsmall enterprises (e.g., tailoring, food preparation, trading). The courses will deliver basic skills \nthat will allow people access to the labor market, and provide a basis for further training.  \n \n42.  These programs may be delivered in one of the following ways: \n \n(i)  Nonformal courses offered by  the Ministry of National Education in life skills \ntraining  such  as  electronics,  sewing,  computer  training,  hair  dressing, \nconstruction, furniture making, fishing, and cooking. The courses are 1\u20133 weeks, \ncovering 1\u20132 competency units. The focus will be on about 20,000 internally \ndisplaced people living in the new relocation sites, and working in collaboration \nwith NGOs and other vocational training institutions. The needs of the specific \ncommunities will be identified before the courses are developed. \n \n(ii)  The skills training center run by the Ministry of Manpower was not damaged by \nthe tsunami, and the International Labour Organization has already recruited a \nnumber of experts to assist in training (although more are needed). Courses \noffered  are  in  traditional  vocational  areas,  including  electrical,  automotive, \nwoodworking,  carpentry,  tailoring,  and  food  preparation.  The  center  will  be \nsupported to expand its operation with additional instructors, materials, operating \ncosts, and to a limited degree with equipment.  \n \n(iii)  Some of the senior secondary vocational schools are still operational, while \nothers will be repaired with project support or other sources. These schools \nprovide community courses out-of-school hours, and support could be given to \nincrease their coverage and scope in key vocational training areas. \n  \n43.  The detailed program, specifying the skills to be offered, to whom, where, and at what \nlevel will be developed during the Project. One central agency should ensure that content of the \noffered training programs is consistent, and that a common certification system is in place to \nallow trainees to build on the competencies mastered.  \n  \n44.

Direct selection of consultants will be undertaken. In addition, community facilitators will \nbe hired through a local NGO or as individuals to assist the villages.  \n \n2.  Housing \na.  Scope \n51.  The housing rehabilitation and reconstruction program will implement the Government\u2019s \npolicy decision to grant a 36 square meter core housing unit to all earthquake-tsunami-affected \nfamilies, irrespective of their previous housing status.8 This component covers rehabilitation of \nabout 10,000 housing units by repairing and reconstructing  about 14,000 housing units that \nwere completely destroyed, which represents 17% of the overall investment requirements. Both \ntypes of interventions require additional support for on-site water and sanitation works, and may \nalso require off-site water and sanitation infrastructure, which in many cases needs to be treated \nas an integral part of housing sector investment. ADB support will follow the Government\u2019s \nhousing strategy9 and pursue the following principles: (i) the program will be people-centered, \n                                                 \n8   BAPPENAS and the International Donor Community (eds.)

The component gives priority to urban or peri-urban \nareas, but can also be implemented in rural areas.  \n \n52.  The component will provide the core housing units, which are expandable through self-\nhelp or by employing low-skilled labor, and include (i) some antiseismic capacity and safeguards \nfor antiseismic behavior for subsequent house expansions; (ii) the use of environmental friendly, \npreferably locally available and renewable building materials, and establishment of building \nmaterial  depots  to  facilitate  cheaper  bulk  supply  of  materials.  The  water  and  sanitation \nsubcomponent use appropriate low-cost decentralized water and sanitation technologies, which \ncan be manufactured on-site and are easy to operate and maintain. It will also identify off-site \ninfrastructure  requirements,  connectors  and  mains,  and  bulk  water  supply  and  treatment \nsystems.  Infrastructure  for  the  support  of  livelihood  activities  and  for  local  economic \ndevelopment will be constructed where necessary. The component will utilize only sites for \nwhich land titles are available or tenure status is being assured, but will include support for \nestablishing alternative land ownership forms, instruments of land consolidation (pooling and re-\nadjustment) and retitling. The component will also offer a microcredit facility for households that \nwould like to borrow for expansion and improvement of their houses. \n \nb.  Subproject Selection Criteria \n53.  Subprojects  will  be  selected  on  the  basis  of  housing  needs  and  community \npreparedness, and will meet the general criteria for the Project as outlined in the main text. \nHousing rehabilitation and reconstruction works will be prioritized following selection criteria to \nbe prepared by the consultants and agreed by the Executing Agency and ADB. Pilot projects \nwill be located in Banda Aceh city, Kabupaten Aceh Besar, and Meulaboh.10 \n \nc.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan   \n54.  The total cost required for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of housing is estimated at \n$81.23 million equivalent comprising $5.18 million in foreign exchange costs and $76.05 million \nequivalent in local currency (Table A2.7). The total cost includes local taxes, and duties and \noperational costs for the project management unit at the branch office of the Executing Agency \nat the provincial level, and project implementation units in the participating cities and regencies. \nThe cost estimates include housing, on-site and off-site infrastructure, and implementation-\nrelated community support services. ADB will finance $72.5 million comprising $5.18 million of \nthe foreign exchange costs and $67.32 million equivalent of the local currency. The Government \nwill finance the remaining balance of $8.73 million equivalent. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n10  To be confirmed by the Government (BAPPENAS, Ministry of Public Works) and local governments. \n ", "50  Appendix 2 \n \nTable A2.7: Cost Estimates for the Housing Subcomponent \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total     \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Phase I  Phase II \nCapacity Building  0.01  0.06  0.07  0.07  0.00 \nDistrict Community Facilitators   0.11  1.63  1.74  0.90  0.84 \nProvincial Project Management           \nConsultants  0.32  1.26  1.58  0.79  0.79 \nTravel and Office Operation  0.02  0.21  0.23  0.12  0.11 \nBasic Rehabilitation of Housing  0.94  20.02  20.96  9.65  6.81 \nConstruction of New Housing  3.78  47.38  51.16  29.92  21.13 \nMicrocredit Facility for House           \nExpansion  0.00  3.00  3.00  1.56  1.44 \nImplementation Supervision  0.0  2.49  2.49  1.25  1.24 \nTotal  5.18  76.05  81.23  48.67  32.36 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nd.  Implementation Arrangements \n55.  The Ministry of Public Works will be the Executing Agency for this component. A central \nproject management unit has been established for Neighborhood Upgrading and Shelter Sector \nProject implementation within the Directorate General of Housing and Settlements, which can \nbe expanded for the requirements of this housing component.  \n \n56.  Participating cities and regencies are expected to formulate administrative procedures \nfor fast-track administration (single window approach) of land titling (where necessary), building \npermits and other licenses or permits, as required. Each participating community will set up a \ncommunity implementation team to ensure full involvement of the community in all project-\nrelated activities following the procedures developed under the Urban Poverty Project.11  \n \n57.  In accordance with the common housing delivery mechanism all over Indonesia, in Aceh \nand North Sumatra the delivery of project housing\u2014both housing repairs as well as construction \nof new housing\u2014will be through two modalities, namely (i) self-help housing or aided self-help \nhousing, supported by skilled labor; and (ii) small contractor built housing, supervised by the \ncommunity implementation team.12 Both these modalities have a proven track record as the \nmain source of housing produced locally, and will offer positive economic spin-off effects and \nlivelihood support for community members who are gainfully employed in construction work \n(cash for work system). \n \n58.  The construction industry is expected to experience a significant revival through the \nProject, which will establish a continuous demand for materials and labor. Parallel efforts of the \nAustralian Agency for  International Development and Ministry of Public Works to develop the \nconstruction materials industry in Aceh will supplement the Project and help to ensure the \ndelivery of the housing program. \n \n59.  Concerning social equity (para. 2), the Government has pronounced its policy to provide \na housing grant to all affected families. The selection of beneficiaries will be handled by the \n                                                 \n11  These community participation practices are similar to those in the ADB supported Community and Local \nGovernment Support Project.

The component will require 6 person-months services of international consulting and 55 \nperson-months of domestic, with specialists in housing and housing finance.  \n \n3.  Irrigation \n \na.  Scope \n \n61.  The Project will focus on rehabilitation of infrastructure and facilities covering about \n31,300 ha in Aceh province and about 1,300 ha in North Sumatra province. The component will \nbe implemented in two phases: phase 1: restoration of irrigation facilities to 24,300 ha along the \nnorth-east coast in Aceh and 1,300 ha in North Sumatra and a preparatory survey and design \nworks for rehabilitating 7,000 ha in the heavily damaged areas in the west coast of Aceh \nprovince; and phase 2: rehabilitation works for  7,000  ha  in  the west coast area  of  Aceh \nprovince, and  water users training  and community empowerment in  all the project-assisted \nirrigation  areas.  The  component  will  rehabilitate  high-priority,  tsunami  and/or  earthquake \ndamaged  irrigation  infrastructure  by  providing  civil  works,  equipment  and  materials,  and \nconsulting  services  for  topographic  surveys,  detailed  engineering  design,  implementation, \nmonitoring and evaluation, and community empowerment/training. The proposed activities will \nrestore the original function of the damaged facilities; no improvement of  infrastructure and \nfacilities over previous design is envisaged. \n \nb.  Scheme Selection Criteria \n62.  In addition to the general selection criteria, priority will be given to schemes that meet \nthe following criteria: (i) most of the beneficiaries identified, (ii) land owners identified, (iii) high \npoverty incidence, (iv) presence of active water users associations, and (v) of stakeholders and \nbeneficiaries  active  in  planning  and  implementation.  No  scheme  will  be  selected  for \nrehabilitation if (i) per hectare rehabilitation cost exceeds the ceiling to be agreed between the \ngovernment and ADB during project implementation, (ii) the scheme is expected to have severe \nenvironmental impacts, or (iii) the scheme will require resettlement of more than 200 people. \n \nc.  Cost Estimates  \n63.  The total cost,  including topographic survey, detailed design, consultants\u2019 fee, land \nacquisition, resettlement and project administration is estimated at $34.7 million equivalent of \nwhich $7.0 million is the direct and indirect foreign exchange cost and $27.7 million is local \ncurrency cost (Table 2.8).  \n \nTable A2.8: Cost Estimates for the Irrigation Subcomponent \n  Foreign  Local  Total     \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Phase I  Phase II \nA.

Consulting services will be required for (i) topographic survey and soil investigation; (ii) \ndetailed  assessment  and  verification  of  damages  in  major  structures;  (iii)  preparation  of \nsubproject summary reports  in  accordance  with  Government  and  ADB  requirements  and \nselection criteria;  and (iv) preparation of detailed design, and  supervision and monitoring of \nrehabilitation works. The component will require 40 person-months of international consulting \nand 200 person-months of domestic, with the following specialists: construction management \nspecialist  and  team  leader  (international),  hydraulics  engineer,  irrigation  engineer, \nenvironmental specialist, sociologist, and economist.  \n \nD.  Physical Infrastructure \n1.  Spatial Planning and Environmental Management \na.  Scope \n66.  With many areas swept by the tsunami, government officials and many groups see an \nopportunity to introduce a new land use/zoning plan before commencing large-scale overall \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  activities  or  resettlement  of  displaced  persons.  The \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  strategy  for  Aceh  and  North  Sumatra  will  be  based  on \nintegrated participatory spatial planning approaches, incorporating environmental management \nand disaster mitigation. Community participation in the decision-making process and ownership \nin the rebuilding of the affected areas is at the core of the activities. Based on experiences from \nthe ongoing Marine and Coastal Resources Management Project,13 principles and procedures \nof integrated coastal zone and watershed management provide a comprehensive decision-\nmaking framework to support reconstruction and introduce a suitable paradigm for rehabilitation \nof institutional (governance) capacity. In view of the complexity of the envisaged reconstruction \nprocess, the conceptual approach of the Marine and Coastal Resources Management Project \nwill have to be adapted to the specific context of the tasks ahead. \n \n67.  The  component  has  five  subcomponents:  (i)  Government  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment, (ii) strategic environmental assessment, (iii) spatial analysis and zoning, (iv) area \nand  site  planning  for  reconstruction,  and  (v)  community  participation  in  planning.  The \nimplementation of the component will take into account the Project\u2019s resettlement framework. \n \nb.  Government Institutional Capacity Development \n68.  This  aims  at  enhancing  government  institutional  capacity  in  spatial  planning,  and \nwatershed and environmental management. Rehabilitation of government institutional capacity \nat the provincial, district and community levels will involve temporary placement of experienced \nresource  planners  and  community  facilitators  to  prepare  integrated  plans,  implementing \nreconstruction activities, and providing monitoring feedback. Education and training of local \ngovernment planners and establishment of new facilities and equipment will occur in parallel. As \npart of the overall training program on spatial planning, environmental management, legislation, \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2000.

Strategic Environmental Assessment \n69.  Environmental criteria for the spatial planning and zoning process will be developed, and \nbaseline environment-related information collected. As part of the environmental assessment, \nsurveys will be carried out for (i) identifying critical habitats, and assessment of ecological status \nof coral reefs and mangroves14 and important biodiversity areas in and adjacent to the damaged \ncoastal areas; (ii) rapid analysis of pollution hotspots in order to exclude, to the extent possible, \nenvironmental and health  risks for communities, assessment of potential contaminations in \nsettlement areas, and potential risks that may stem from agricultural/fisheries production and \nwater consumption; and (iii) identification and delineation of conservation areas. \n \n70.  Technical  advice  will  be  provided  on  ADB  and  Government  policies,  laws,  and \nregulations relating to the requirements for environmental assessment such as environmental \nimpact  assessment/initial  environmental  examination,  and  to  carry  out  environmental \nassessments for subprojects, in accordance with the Environmental Assessment Framework set \nup for Project. \n \nd.  Spatial Analysis and Zoning \n71.  A broad-scale spatial analysis of the pre- and post-tsunami conditions in coastal areas, \nwatersheds, and former and current settlement areas will be carried out. Detailed damage \nassessment information and maps at 1:100,000 scale will be prepared for determining optimal \nlocations for settlements, agricultural areas, and infrastructure, etc., and protection against \nand/or reducing the human and physical damage caused by potential future earthquakes and \ntsunamis. Sites for reconstruction will be identified and prioritized based on agreed selection \ncriteria  such  as  accessibility,  strategic  importance,  extent  of  physical  damage,  and \nreconstruction capacity. Criteria for geographically locating critical public facilities, such as \nhospitals, police/fire stations, schools, water supply installations, communication systems, and \nairports, will be established. \n \n72.  A geographical information system will be established, primarily using existing data sets. \nClose  collaboration  is  being  sought  with  established  expert  groups  and  involved  donors. \nAdditional data will be obtained making use of satellite imagery and aerial photography. Field \nsurveys will be carried out to obtain essential information that is unavailable and considered to \nbe essential, based upon the principle of minimum data sets. Thematic data analysis will include \nhazard  risk  assessments,  and  identification  of  land  use  options  based  on  land  suitability \nassessments. Processed thematic information, for instance through computer modeling, will be \nmade available to a broad range of stakeholders involved in rehabilitation activities, including \ngovernment agencies, NGOs/civil society organizations, universities, and the private sector. The \ngeographical  information  system  will  serve  as  a  flexible  decision-support  system  for  the \nconcerned  stakeholders;  it  will  be,  based  on  sound  data  and  be  used  to  develop \noptions/scenarios for informed decisions.  \n \n                                                 \n14  In conjunction with detailed coral reef surveys that will be carried out within the framework of ADB. 2002.

This subcomponent, based upon outputs of subcomponent 3, provides for detailed site \nplanning at 1:10,000 up to 1:2,500 scale. It will make available the necessary technical and \nfinancial support required for acquisition and thematic analysis of spatial information for (i) \nestablishing comprehensive community plans and (ii) detailed site planning in selected priority \nareas. Outputs for detailed site planning (to be based upon additional surveys if deemed \nnecessary)  will  include  (i)  location  of  critical  infrastructure  and  settlements,  (ii)  proposed \ngreenbelts, (iii) access routes to assembly points providing shelter in case of hazards in \nsettlement areas; (iv) landscape architectural design for settlement areas, (v) detailed land \nsuitability  assessments  for  specific  issues,  and  (vi)  review  of  land  ownership  and  land \nsettlement  requirements.  Detailed  maps  with  descriptions  on  suggested  land  use  will  be \ndeveloped, taking into account legal requirements including restrictions, economic incentives, \nand guidelines for construction, as well as other socioeconomic and cultural considerations \nincluding the Project\u2019s resettlement framework. This subcomponent as well as subcomponent 3 \nwill provide spatial information for social services delivery, livelihood support, and infrastructure \nrehabilitation activities. \n \n74.  Where appropriate, site locations cannot be identified; specific building code criteria will \nbe established to render key facilities less vulnerable to natural disasters. In cases where a \ncoastal green buffer zone is being considered, fishers may require continued access to the sea. \nAppropriate site selection and building codes for the installation of support facilities, such as \nfish-landing sites, will be essential for this. \n \nf.  Community Participation in Planning \n75.  The effectiveness of zoning and regional spatial planning depends on acceptance and \nparticipation of the local residents. Through public consultation processes, to be initiated at the \nearliest possible stage, the communities will be provided with an opportunity to review/respond \nto the proposed overall spatial/zonation plans. This will ensure that the design of spatial plans \nincorporates the opinions of resource users and coastal communities, and empowers the \nvarious stakeholders to participate in establishing  the  detailed  community  plans.  Extensive \npublic education and awareness-building activities will include environmental awareness training \nand the establishment of local ordinances to conserve and manage natural resources.  \n \n76.  Community facilitators will assist the community in voicing concerns, if any, with respect \nto the spatial/zonation plan to the planning agencies and in developing alternative options and \nsolutions. They may play a key role in mediation on the plan, as well as on potential conflicts \nover  land  ownership/land  titles  in  some  affected  areas.  Appropriate  conflict  resolution \nmechanisms will be put in place. \n \n    g.  Management of Waste Disposal \n \n77.  The ETESP will (i) assist the relevant government agencies in designing an efficient \nsystem for the disposal of waste and debris in the rehabilitation and reconstruction process in \nan  environmentally  friendly  manner;  (ii)  assist  in  establishing  a  coordinated  institutional \narrangement for such disposal; (iii) provide training to the relevant government agencies in \nefficient management of waste and debris disposal; and (iv) design an environmentally sound \nsystem for waste and debris clean up that the ETESP sub-components can adopt. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  55 \nh.  Component Phasing/Packaging \n78.  The project design will follow a phased approach. The highest financial investment in \nrelative terms in phase I has been estimated for subcomponent 3 (Table A.2.9): Because spatial \nanalysis and zoning has overall high priority as it is of critical importance as an input for other \nsubcomponents,  it  will  be  quickly  pursued.  All  subcomponents  are  required  to  start \nimplementation in the early project stages. Subcomponent 1 will gradually shift its focus from \npersonnel  replacement  toward  capacity-building  activities  oriented  to  the  long  term. \nSubcomponent 2 will gradually shift its focus from urgently required baseline survey type \nassessments  toward  detailed  environmental  assessments  for  environmental  compliance  of \nproject components. Activities related to community participation and area and site planning for \nreconstruction will be initiated as early as feasible but are expected to peak in phase 2, due to \nexpected delays in the overall reconstruction process. \n \ni.  Cost Estimates \n79.  The total component cost is estimated at $15.5 million equivalent comprising $6.0 million \nin foreign exchange and $9.5 million equivalent in local currency (Table A2.9).

Special  studies  and  surveys,  training,  social  preparation  and  community \nempowerment,  and  database  development  will  be  contracted  to  qualified  local \nacademic/research institutions, universities, and consulting firms in accordance with competitive \nselection criteria and procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n2.  Roads and Bridges   \na.  Scope \n81.  The Project will rehabilitate and reconstruct the Aceh east coast road (Banda Aceh-Sigli-\nLhokseumawe-North Sumatra Border), Banda Aceh-Krueng Raya road, and Banda Aceh urban \nroads with the total road length to be rehabilitated (including bridges) of 115 kilometers (km). \nThe objective is to help alleviate the difficult situation faced by the affected population  and \n ", "56  Appendix 2 \nrestore economic and social activities in NAD province. The roads and bridges were either \nphysically affected by the earthquake and tsunami or indirectly affected by the disaster.  \n \n82.  The  ongoing  loan  Road  Rehabilitation Sector Project15 has been reprogrammed to \nsupport the rehabilitation of 20 km of roads. The rehabilitation of the remaining 95 km of \ndamaged roads and bridges will be the project scope under this component. \n \nb.  Subproject Selection Criteria \n83.  The subprojects can be classified into two categories: (i) roads and bridges that are \nphysically (and thus directly) affected by the earthquake and tsunami, and (ii) roads that are not \ndamaged by the earthquake and tsunami but need improvement following the collapse of some \nroads. The latter relates to (i) capacity expansion of Banda Aceh urban roads due to traffic \ndiversion following the collapse of some roads and due to the change of urban mobility patterns, \n(ii) improvement of east-west roads to get the isolated areas accessible by four-wheel motor \nvehicles, or (iii) betterment of the east coast road to accommodate the increasing heavy \nvehicles during the reconstruction period and future traffic growth. \n \n84.  The road sections to be actually rehabilitated or reconstructed will be identified and \nrelevant design carried out upon completion of a detailed damage assessment.  \n \nc.  Cost Estimates \n85.  The total cost of the component is estimated at $22.1 million equivalent (Table A2.10) \ncomprising $6.4 million in foreign exchange and $15.7 million equivalent in local currency.

Manila. \n ", "58  Appendix 2 \nE.  Fiduciary Governance  \n1.  Strengthening Fiduciary Oversight \na.  Rationale \n91.  Notwithstanding the creation of any new coordinating structures focused on the tsunami \nrecovery and rehabilitation, there is an immediate need to ensure that the existing fiduciary \nstructures in Aceh and North Sumatra are functioning. This is an essential prerequisite for \nensuring that the funds utilized for the reconstruction and rehabilitation phase are utilized \neffectively  and  consistently  with  international  fiduciary  standards.  Funds  for  the  tsunami \nreconstruction and rehabilitation effort are likely to be channeled in a variety of ways, including a \nmultidonor trust fund. The Government is acutely aware that to ensure that the commitments \nfrom the donor community are realized into actual contributions, it must present a clear strategy \non the fiduciary arrangements to the donor community. Given the history of fiduciary weakness \nin Indonesia this issue has to be tackled on a number of fronts. \n \n92.  For this purpose, ADB proposes to leverage its technical advantage in the area of public \nfinancial management utilizing the analyses and knowledge gained during the processing of \nboth the recently approved State Audit Reform (STAR) Sector Development Project17 and the \ntechnical assistance grant provided to build capacity of the Anticorruption Commission (KPK).18 \nSupport is focused on the Supreme Audit Agency (BPK), which is expected to take the lead on \nthe overall fiduciary arrangements as the external audit of the Government. BPK will coordinate \nwith the Government through the proposed Aceh Reconstruction Implementation Coordination \nBoard (BP-R2MAS) that will be established and led by BAPPENAS. BAPPENAS is also the \nappointed Government body to monitor support coming from the donor community, including \nsupport to BPK. \n \n93.  Consistent with the approach taken in the STAR Sector Development Project, BPK \nrecognizes that the work of the external audit is very dependent on systems established by the \nexecutive. The latter involve the funds flow and the internal controls put in place by the Ministry \nof Finance. In addition, a risk-based approach to auditing that recognizes that not everything \ncan be audited in detail is very dependent on the effective functioning of internal audit. For \nAceh, the critical internal audit institutions (BAWADAS) are those operating at the regional level \nof government\u2014the provincial and the district Bawasdas. BPK is keen to engage the Bawasdas \nin Aceh to help ensure that the internal control systems are operating effectively in the districts. \nSome support is also envisaged as necessary for the central internal audit agencies in the line \nministries, the inspector generals. \n \n94.  BPK  also  recognizes  that  the  donor  community  would  want  to  see  follow-up \ninvestigations on any anticorruption activities. The two entities that play a key role are the \nAttorney General\u2019s Office and KPK. Unlike the Attorney General\u2019s Office, KPK is a relatively \nnew institution, and requires capacity building if it is to be able to carry out investigations on the \ncases referred by BPK. Its processes need to be strengthened and it needs to be provided with \nadditional operating budget for specific Aceh cases. This support is expected to allow the \ncommunity at large to recognize the benefits of KPK as a catalyst for change. The Aceh \nactivities of KPK will enable it to cement its role in the overall fiduciary framework of Indonesia. \n \n                                                 \n17  ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the State Audit Reform Sector Development Project. Manila. \n18  ADB. 2004.

Notwithstanding the fact that BPK\u2019s mandate is limited to the activities of Government \ninstitutions,  BPK  also  has  a  role  in  commenting  on  the  overall  strength  of  the  fiduciary \nframework covering government, NGO, and private institutions operating in Aceh. To that effect, \nBPK intends to liaise with auditors of the other institutions to identify the key fiduciary risks. At \nthe outset, Indonesian NGOs are receiving funds directly from many domestic and international \nsources. However, many have openly stated  that they have limited financial management \ncapacity and are concerned that the vast amount of funds being channeled directly through \nthem  may  be  wasted.  They  have  requested  BAPPENAS  and  BPK  to  support  financial \nmanagement training. \n \nb.  Subcomponents \n96.  The support will comprise six main subcomponents: (i) capacity building for BPK to carry \nout external auditing on the Aceh funds utilization; (ii) restoring the internal control and systems \nto channel funds in the Director General of Treasury in the Ministry of Finance; (iii) restoring the \ncapacity of local government internal audit structures (Bawasdas); (iv) providing support to the \nCommission for Eradication of Corruption in Indonesia; and (v) providing administrative support \nand general contingency.  \n \n97.  The total cost is estimated at $7.0 million equivalent, comprising $1.2 million of foreign \nexchange cost and $5.8 million equivalent of local currency (Table A2.12). The financing plan is \nsummarized in Table A2.13. \n \nTable A2.12: Cost Estimates for the Sound Fiduciary Framework Subcomponent  \n($ \u2019000) \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Currency  Currency  Cost \nA.

The proposed support of $7.00 million will cover the mid 2005\u20132007 period after which \nthe more traditional fiduciary structures will take over. Although the support to BPK and KPK will \ncover  activities  over  the  full  2  years,  support  for  the  development  of  appropriate  internal \ncontrols, the restoration of internal audit at the regional government level, and the financial \nmanagement training of the NGOs will be aimed to kick start the overall fiduciary framework \nduring the next 8\u201312 months in Aceh. This will provide confidence to the donor community that \nappropriate structures are in place to allow BPK to carry out effective audits. After the first year \nthe internal control systems will be supported by a combination of traditional  government \nstructures as well as more extensive reconstruction and rehabilitation projects being funded by \nthe international community. Any support to building or equipment infrastructure is only to \nensure that the immediate requirements for the kick-start process are met. Finally, the detailed \nimplementing  arrangements,  including  the  procurement  contracts  will  be  finalized  through \nspecialized consultants before any money is actually disbursed. If this results in any savings, \nthese will either be returned to the funding source or reallocated once approval is given.  \n \n99.  Capacity Building for BPK. In addition to its standard audit role, BPK is thought to be \nable to carry out the following: \n \n(i)  Conduct an ex ante assessment of the internal control systems and the funds \nflow that will be established to fast track the rehabilitation and construction \nphase, and provide advice on to how to strengthen them. \n(ii)  Establish a new audit paradigm that would look at combining both financial and \noperational aspects of auditing, develop more streamlined and results-orientated \naudit approaches, and undertake smaller and more focused audits on a regular \nbasis rather that one audit at a specific point in time. This may include the \npossibility of having joint audits. \n(iii)  Take a global perspective of the various types of support coming into the region, \nboth public and private, and coordinating with the auditors of the private and \nNGO entities so that a more comprehensive picture can be obtained of the \nactivities and its outcomes.19  \n(iv)  Coordinating with audit institutes of the other tsunami-affected countries, as well \nas the donor countries to identify issues and concerns, as well as obtain lessons \nlearned from other previous disasters. \n \n100.  The proposed support to BPK focuses on (i) 4 months intensive audit for the crisis period \n(Feb\u2013May 2005) and (ii) 8 months intensive audit for the rehabilitation period (June 2005\u2013 \nJanuary  2006).  The  audit  activities  will  be  closely  monitored  and  supervised  by  BPK \nmanagement who will be assisted by an international consultant. International experiences will \nbe sought by holding an international conference involving selected supreme audit institutions \nand donors around the world. The audit activities will require supporting activities. BPK has no \noffices in Banda Aceh and so it will need to set up a temporary office in the province. The audit \nmay  require  follow-up  audit  involving  authorized/related  parties  such  as  the  Corruption \nCommission (KPK) through an investigative audit.  \n \n101.  A critical aspect of BPK\u2019s role of in auditing the tsunami funds is the need to establish \nconfidence in its auditing process and methodologies. BPK must ensure the donor community \nthat it will follow transparent and internationally accepted auditing procedures. BPK has agreed \nthat it will look to establish an independent advisory body comprising individuals from key \nsupreme audit institutions, who will provide independent advice to BPK. In addition, BPK \n                                                 \n19  The Government has already appointed Ernst and Young to be the auditors for the Aceh funds that are being \nchanneled through the media-based collection agencies such as Metro TV. In addition, the United Nations is also \nlooking at a private audit firm to audit United Nations activities in the area. \n ", "  Appendix 2  61 \nrecognizes that it may have resource constraints and where necessary will engage external \nauditors to carry out specific audit activities. The intention is that the advisory body and the \nutilization of external audit staff will also assist capacity building in the long run. BPK will also \nassist the Government in collating data about the activities of the other organizations by liaising \nwith the other audit firms operating in Aceh. \n \n102.  Restoration of Internal Control and Funds Channeling Systems in the Director \nGeneral of Treasury ($1.890 million). This would, following a more detailed assessment of \nneeds, look at; restoring the infrastructure of the central and local government treasury offices in \nBanda Aceh; providing for an Aceh-North Sumatra focused team at the Director General of \nTreasury  offices  in  Jakarta;  restoring  information  technology  and  other  communication \nequipment; and supporting the Inspectorate General of the Ministry of Finance to establish the \nappropriate funds channeling, internal controls, and reporting systems for Aceh/North Sumatra \ndedicated funds..  \n \n103.  Restoring the Capacity of Local Government Internal Audit Structures (Bawasdas) \n($0.720 million). Working through the coordination of the Inspectorate General in the Ministry of \nHome Affairs, this would look at restoring the damaged local government internal audit agencies \n(Bawasda), and providing the appropriate training to local government internal auditors. The \nSTAR project has already identified the need to support Bawasda at the provincial level. \nHowever, given the scale of the damage it is proposed that the provincial and district Bawasdas \nin Aceh and North Sumatra be supported. \n \n104.  Providing Support to the Commission for Eradication of Corruption in Indonesia \nand for an Aceh Coordinator ($0.450 million). This support is a lump sum allocation to the \ncommission to undertake further investigation on any allegations of corruption arising out of the \naudits as well as from public sources. The commission will work closely with BPK as well as the \ninternal audit agencies in Government.  \n \n105.  Providing  Support  to  the  Working  Group  on  Governance  within  the  new \nReconstruction and Rehabilitation Body (R2MAS) ($1.150 million). BAPPENAS has been \nassigned as coordinator for R3MAS. The R3MAS will be collapsed into a new Reconstruction \nand Rehabilitation Body\u2014R2MAS. Within R2MAS, a unit will coordinate and establish the \noverall financial governance systems for Aceh funds. This support to the working group in \nR2MAS  is  to  ensure  better  coordination  within  the  external  auditor  (BPK),  the  internal \nsupervision  institutions  (Bawasda,  BPKP,  Inspectorate  General),  other  private  auditors \ncompanies, parliament, NGOs, and the general public in monitoring and supervising both of \npublic and private aid funds on tsunami-affected areas in Indonesia. An important aspect is the \nspecific support that for NGO community on financial management. This is recognizes that the \nNGO community are significant components in the disaster situation and that considerable \nfunds are being channeled to Aceh activities directly through them. The Government recognizes \nthat NGOs need more support while retaining their operational independence. \n \n106.  Funding Administrative Support and General Contingency ($0.470 million). The \nlatter will be used to provide procurement and financial management specialists to monitor and \nreport on the Project; in addition, a small contingency will cover unforeseen requirements. \n \nc.  Implementation Arrangements \n107.  The Aceh and North Sumatra assistance is designed as an expansion of the scope of \nthe STAR project and will be known as the STAR-Aceh activity. To that extent the same \nrespective STAR implementing agencies\u2013namely, BPK, Inspectorate General of the Ministry of \nFinance,  and  Inspectorate  General  of  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  will  undertake  the \n ", "62  Appendix 2 \nimplementation. Support to KPK will be channeled through the Ministry of Finance. An Aceh \ncoordinator will be placed in the new R2MAS unit, which will be the Executing Agency for this \nactivity. The coordinator will be responsible for overall monitoring of the STAR-Aceh, as well as \nensure effective liaison with the STAR program loan activities.  \n \nd.  Consulting Services \n108.  The Project will fund 37 person-months of international experts and 213 person-months \nof domestic experts. The international experts will ideally comprise ex members of supreme \naudit institutions with at least 10 years of experience. They will builds BPK capacity to carry out \nexternal auditing on Aceh funds utilization, provide BPK with an advisory body, support the \nexternal audit of the multidonor trust funds, and support R2MAS in identifying international best \npractices for the management of disaster funds. The domestic consultants have a range of \nauditing and accounting expertise to support the following: \n \n(i)  Directorate General of Treasury in Ministry of Finance in designing appropriate \ninternal control systems (90 person-months), \n(ii)  Inspectorate General in the Ministry of Finance on the internal audit systems (33 \nperson-staff months), \n(iii)  development of appropriate funds flow systems (53 person-months), and \n(iv)  R2MAS  to  devise  a  strategic  governance  framework,  and  provide  domestic \nexpertise on external-internal audit (36 person-months). \n \n2.  Enhancing Governance in the Delivery of Project Assistance \n \n109.  This  component  is  to  facilitate  effective  implementation  of  disaster  management, \nrehabilitation  and  reconstruction  (DMRR)  support,  leading  to  the  economic  revival  of  the \naffected regions. Its immediate objective is to help achieve good governance in the delivery of \nDMRR support to the affected regions. The component will have two subcomponents:  \n \n(i)  ensuring sound fiduciary governance in the delivery of ETESP assistance, focusing \non  financial  management,  design  of  administrative  accountability  mechanisms, \nefficient procurement arrangements, and effective project implementation; and  \n(ii)  participatory planning and monitoring and evaluation support, focusing on community \nparticipation,  land  tenure  assessment,  tracking  of  progress  with  regard  to  the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), and monitoring and evaluation. \n \n110.  The component will involve the establishment of two teams to provide advisory support \nto the Government and ADB in all general project administration and cross-cutting technical \nassessments covered in the Project in line with the description provided in para. 61 of the \nReport and Recommendation of the President. Most activities under this component will be \nanchored at the extended mission to Sumatra (EMS), and support the implementation of its \nwork program in delivering ADB support.  \n \n111.  The total cost of this component is estimated at $3,500,000 equivalent, including foreign \nexchange costs of $2,066,600 and local currency costs of $1,433,400 equivalent. ADB will \nfinance the entire costs of this component in view of the emergency nature of the operation.  \n \n112.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for  subcomponent (i), and will closely liaise with \nBAPPENAS and the proposed Implementation Coordination Board for Aceh-North Sumatra \nRehabilitation and Reconstruction (BKP). BKP will be the Executing Agency for subcomponent \n(ii).  About  78  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  about  252  person-months  of \ndomestic consulting will be required. Outline terms of reference and reporting arrangements for \n ", "  Appendix 2  63 \nthe consultants are set out in Supplementary Appendix D. The consultants will be recruited in \ntwo teams. The subcomponent (i) team may divide its time between BKP offices and EMS in the \naffected  regions,  and  the  Indonesia  Resident  Mission,  while  the  consultants  under \nsubcomponent (ii) will be based in the Province of Aceh.

Introduction \n1.  The Earthquake and Tsunami Emergency Support Project is categorized as environment \ncategory B. An overall initial environmental examination (IEE) to assess the generic impacts of \neach project component shows that the ETESP will have a number of positive impacts on the \nenvironment. These include rehabilitating the damaged coastal zones, mangroves, and coral \nreefs; reviving agricultural production; and reducing health risks by rehabilitating damaged water \nsupply and sanitation facilities.  It also shows that none of the envisaged interventions, at this \nstage of project design, is known to be environmentally critical or projected to create significant \nadverse or negative impacts on the environment. The potential negative impacts are localized \nand short-term, and can be mitigated. Therefore, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) is \nnot required. In addition, the spatial planning and environmental management component of the \nETESP will mainstream environmental considerations into the planning process. \n \n2.  Given the ETESP\u2019s emergency assistance nature, subproject-specific IEEs have not yet \nbeen prepared, but will be developed prior to implementation. To guide the environmental \nassessment  of  subprojects  and  facilitate  institutional  arrangements  and  compliance  with \nenvironmental  requirements  of  Indonesia  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  an \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  (EARP)  has  been  agreed  with  the \nGovernment (paras. 14-21). \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n3.  The ETESP has 11 main components: agriculture, fisheries, micro and small enterprise \nsupport, health, education, rural water supply and sanitation, housing, irrigation, spatial planning \nand  environmental  management,  roads  and  bridges,  and  power.  A  description  of  the \ncomponents is given in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n4.  Physical and Ecological Resources. The tsunami generated a range of environmental \nproblems with harm to human health and damage to the environment. It caused widespread \ndeposition  of  debris  including  municipal  waste  from  dump  sites,  household  waste,  and \nhazardous substances, and it triggered coastal zone retreat and erosion, coral reef damage, \nloss of marine and terrestrial habitats, soil salinization, destruction of vegetation and landscape, \nand water contamination. The environmental damage overall is estimated at $664.6 million,20 \ncomprising one fourth for direct destruction of environmental assets and the balance in losses in \nenvironmental services. \n \n5.  Economic  Development,  and  Social  and  Cultural  Resources.  Over  the  last  2 \ndecades, civilian and secessionist conflict in Aceh has claimed the lives of about 10,000 people. \nThe central Government has declared the earthquake and tsunami as national disasters and \ntaken over administration of the province. In 2003, Aceh\u2019s regional gross domestic product \n(GDP) was Rp38.6 trillion ($4.5 billion), accounting for 2.3% of national GDP. The Central \nStatistical Agency has determined that 660 Acehnese villages, including urban villages, with a \npopulation  of  650,000  have  been  affected.  The  disaster  struck  individuals,  households, \ncommunities and social organizations, and economic chains. The incidence of poverty in Aceh \nwas lower than the national average until the introduction of martial law in 2001. However, the \n                                                 \n20  BAPPENAS (National Development Planning Agency) and International Donor Community. January 2005.

More information is given in the IEE report in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation  Measures \n6.  Reconstruction  works  on  most  infrastructure  facilities,  other  than  some  individual \nhousing, are expected to take place at original sites. Roads will follow the original right-of-way; \nchanges in alignment or widening are not anticipated. Short-term minor negative impacts may \nbe associated with civil works, such as dust and noise generation, soil erosion, and damage to \nland and surface water due to inappropriate handling of excavated materials and wastes. In \nview of the high requirements for timber materials for reconstruction and their potential negative \nimpact on the forest resources in Aceh and North Sumatra, the ETESP will develop guidelines, \nbased upon the knowledge of key stakeholders and specialized organizations, for the purchase \nof timber to be used for construction projects. \n \n7.  Rapid environmental assessment checklists were completed for the various project \ncomponents from 10 to 14 March 2005. They provide the necessary basic information for this \npreliminary screening of potential impacts on the environment. The potential impacts have been \nbroken down to subcomponent level, as outlined in the Memorandum of Understanding between \nthe Government and ADB on 10 March 2005. The possible environmental impacts that may be \nencountered during implementation and some suggested mitigating measures21 are presented \nin the attached table. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n1.  Institutional Requirements \n \n8.  A  multidisciplinary  environmental  assessment  team,  comprising  international  and \ndomestic consultants, experts, and government administration staff, will be set up in the project \nmanagement office (PMO). The team will carry out IEEs (or in the unlikely event the necessary \nEIAs, jointly with the environment specialist of the Southeast Asia Department), and inspect and \nensure compliance with the requirements for public consultations, mitigation measures, and \nenvironmental monitoring described in the IEEs for all subprojects funded under  the ETESP. \nThe team will provide overall technical advice to all subprojects on a day-to-day basis and \nproactively carry out necessary field visits. Moreover, the team will commission environmental \nassessment studies to individual specialists and supervise their work. The team will work in \nclose consultation with staff of the ETESP component on spatial planning and environmental \nmanagement, the environment specialist of Southeast Asia Department and the Environment \nand  Social  Safeguard  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  of  ADB \nheadquarters. \n \n9.  The  budget  required  for  these  tasks,  as  well  as  for  the  required  measures  for \nenvironmental mitigation and monitoring and site preparations for the individual subprojects, is \nestimated at 2.5% of the total project cost, or $7.5 million (called the environment fund). This \nPMO will manage this fund. Any surplus will be reallocated for other subproject activities. \n \n  2.   Environmental Monitoring \n \n10.  Monitoring  activities  for  subprojects  will  be  determined  in  detail  in  the  individual \nsubproject  IEEs.  The  IEE  report  (Supplementary  Appendix  C)  describes  the  rationale  for \nenvironmental monitoring of the ETESP activities in a list that requires continuous updating and \n                                                 \n21  Mitigation measures will be described in the subproject IEEs. \n ", "70   Appendix 5 \n \nrevision, particularly  taking account of recommended/agreed measures in the subproject IIE \nreports. \n \nF.  Public Consultations and Information Disclosure \n11.  Due to the ETESP\u2019s emergency assistance nature, a detailed public consultation has not \nyet  been  undertaken.  Meetings  during  ETESP  formulation  with  concerned  government \nagencies, bilateral donors, nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and individuals from affected \ndistricts confirmed wide interest in the proposed activities, as they are seen as essential for \nreestablishing communities\u2019 livelihoods and supporting long-term sustainable development. \n \n12.  As all environmental documents are subject to public disclosure in accordance with the \nADB Environment Policy (2002) and Disaster Emergency and Assistance Policy (2003); they \nwill be made available to the public, if requested. \n \nG.  Environmental Assessment and Review Procedure for  Subprojects \n \n  1.  Requirement for an Environmental Assessment Report  \n \n13.  Subproject IEEs will be prepared as an integral part of subproject design. They will \nprovide  information  on  baseline  environment  conditions  in  the  subproject  area,  and  key \nengineering indicators of the subproject that have environmental implications. They will also \nidentify  specific  potential  adverse  impacts  related  to  location,  design,  construction,  and \noperation;  and  outline  specific  mitigation  measures,  including  financial  sources,  as  a \nprerequisite for subproject approval. A monitoring and enforcement program will be developed \nto ensure that none of the subprojects have major adverse environmental impacts. \n \n14.   Public consultation will be conducted through interviews, meetings, or surveys as part of \nenvironmental  assessment  for  each  scheme.  The  results  of  public  consultation  will  be \ndocumented and reflected in the IEE. \n \n2.  Responsibilities of Implementing Agencies and ADB \n \n15.  The following review procedure will be adopted to facilitate identification and mitigation \nof potential environmental problems/risks related to each subproject: \n \n(i)  Implementing agencies (IAs) will have the following responsibilities: \n \n(a)  Carry out an IEE for each subproject22 and submit it to ADB as part of the \nsubproject proposal.  \n(b)  Obtain environmental clearance from the relevant subproject approving \nagency  and  ADB  for  environmental  compliance  before  awarding  any \ncontracts for that subproject.  \n(c)  Irrespective  of  if  the  subproject  required  an  IEE,  include  basic \nenvironmental  safeguards  to  be  adopted  during  construction  in  the \ncontract documents. For subprojects that require an IEE, the  contract \ndocuments will include clauses for the implementation of environmental \nmitigation measures as described in the IEE report and the approving \nagency clearance. \n                                                 \n22  Except subprojects with solely capacity building and fiduciary/governance-related activities. \n ", "                    Appendix 5         7  1    \n           \n \n(d)  Be  fully  responsible  for  monitoring  and  reporting  to  ADB  on \nimplementation of the environmental mitigation measures described in the \nIEE report. \n(ii)  ADB will have the following responsibilities: \n \n(a)  Review the IEE reports and approve qualifying subprojects. \n(b)  Disclose the findings of the IEE and summary IEE in accordance with the \nrequirements under the ADB Environment Policy (2002) and Disaster and \nEmergency Assistance Policy (2004).  \n(c)  Monitor the implementation of mitigation measures through project review \nmissions,  and  conduct  environmental  performance  monitoring  as \nnecessary. \n16.  The IAs will ensure that ADB is given access to undertake environmental monitoring of \nsubprojects, if needed, and will submit quarterly progress review reports describing the progress \nof environmental monitoring and highlighting any other environmental issues that may  have \narisen during implementation, and measures taken to address such issues. The IAs will also \nensure that all environmental assessment documents, including the environmental monitoring \nreports, are maintained systematically as part of the subproject-specific record. \n \n3.  Environmental Criteria for Subproject Selection \n \n17.  Project siting is a major criterion for subproject selection. For instance, subprojects with \nsites proposed within the\u2014likely to be declared\u2014coastal buffer zone will not be supported by \nthe ETESP. Subprojects will not be located in or adjacent to environmentally sensitive areas \nsuch as (i) protected areas, (ii) buffer zones of protected areas, (iii) wetlands, (iv) mangroves, \n(v) estuaries, (vi) special areas for protecting biodiversity or with other significant ecological or \nother values, and (vii) pollution hotspots. The ETESP component on spatial planning and \nenvironmental  management  will,  inter  alia,  provide  support  in  the  process  of  identifying \nappropriate project sites during the design stage so that environmental impacts that may arise \nfrom project siting can be avoided or minimized. \n \n18.  In view of the very special post-tsunami situation, any subproject preparation should \ninclude site visits to assess whether a clean-up of debris/waste will be necessary or whether it \nhas already been completed in a satisfactory manner. If remedial actions are to be taken prior to \nconstruction activities, appropriate clean-up/waste disposal activities will have to be properly \ndefined and carried out. Costs for site visit and assessment and clean-up/disposal activities will \nhave to be borne by the subproject budget.  \n \n19.  For each subproject, an IEE will be prepared, with the exception of subprojects that can \nbe identified as activities/nonphysical interventions to build up/reestablish human resource \ncapacities, fiduciary and governance framework, etc.  \n \n20.  The environmental assessment and review procedure will take into account any relevant \npost-tsunami Government regulations and procedures (e.g., guidelines for waste disposal and \nmanagement, reconstruction of housing). The IAs will ensure that all activities are carried out in \naccordance with both existing guidelines and any new guidelines and technical standards, as \nwell as with ADB environmental assessment requirements, as set out in  Environment Policy \n(2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). \n \n ", "72   Appendix 5 \n \nH.  Findings, Recommendations, and Conclusions \n21.  The ETESP mostly focuses on reconstruction and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, \nas well as on rebuilding public services and reestablishing institutional capacities to cope with \nthe  impacts  of  the  disaster.  Only  minor  and  short-term potentially adverse environmental \nimpacts are anticipated, provided that the environmental assessment and review procedure is \nfollowed and be fully complied with. The impacts are considered to be controllable through \nimplementation of appropriate mitigation measures and environmental monitoring, and through \nthe PMO\u2019s readiness to take corrective actions when deemed necessary and recommended by \nthe environmental assessment team. The adoption of good construction practices, incorporation \nof mitigation measures during design, inclusion of suitable clauses in construction contract \ndocuments, and implementation of the agreed mitigation measures during construction will help \nprevent any environmental damage from happening. \n \n22.  In summary, the IEE for the ETESP shows that no significant adverse environmental \nimpacts  are  expected  to  result  from  the  proposed  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  work. \nConsequently, no need EIA is needed at this stage. In the unlikely event that a specific \nsubproject is rated as category A, a full subproject EIA for that particular subproject will have to \nbe undertaken. \n \n23.  The PMO will comply with the rule to regard the environmental categorization as a \ncontinuous process that may change the environmental assessment requirements within the \nsubproject cycle. Previously unknown but then available information must, at all times and all \ncircumstances, be taken into consideration for the continuous task of environmental assessment \nof the ETESP. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "                    Appendix 5         7  3    \n           \n \nTable A5:  Components, Their Potential Environmental Impacts, and Proposed Mitigation \nMeasures \n \nEnvironmental \nMitigation  Impact \nComponent  Subcomponent  Potential Impacts \nMeasures  Mitigation \nPrinciples \nAgriculture  Community  None anticipated.

Background \n \n1.  The Government Indonesia has requested Asian development Bank (ADB) assistance for the \nEarthquake and Tsunami Emergency Support Project (ETESP). The ETESP will assist rehabilitation and \nreconstruction of Aceh through a multisector approach covering housing, education, health, water and \nsanitation, agriculture, natural resources and coastal management, road and power infrastructure, and \ncapacity building. Each sector includes various components subdivided in subprojects. Components with \nground  impacts  include  natural  resources  and  coastal  management,  or  components  requiring \nrehabilitation, reconstruction, or new construction of water and sanitation facilities; housing; health centers; \nschool buildings; government offices; irrigation schemes; power distribution networks; and roads and \nbridges. Only subprojects aiming at new construction are expected to involve land acquisition and \nresettlement (LAR). Rehabilitation or reconstruction subprojects will be implemented at their previous sites \nand in general are not expected to involve LAR. \n \n2.  To understand LAR magnitude and potential implementation difficulties, considering the level of \ndisruption and destruction caused by the disaster is important. Some of the subprojects areas have \nregistered no disruption and some have been partially disrupted and damaged, but continue to host \nfunctional communities. The scope of subprojects in these areas will be more developmental. However, \nsome areas have been completely damaged physically and disrupted socially. In the latter, active \ncommunities, a functioning government, and a reliable spatial plan will have to be established to allow \nsubproject implementation.  \n \n3.  As LAR planning and compensation will be much more difficult in areas that have been completely \ndestroyed, project activities have been divided in two phases. Phase 1, to begin after approval of the grant \nand its effectiveness and continue until ETESP completion in mid-2008, includes (i) rehabilitation or \nreconstruction activities, (ii) construction activities in areas with no or partial disruption, and (iii) preparatory \nwork for phase 2, involving assessment, governance, spatial planning, and community empowerment \ntasks. Phase 2 will begin by October 2005, after the preparatory work under phase 1 has been concluded, \nand continue until ETESP completion. Phase 2 will target construction activities in areas where total \ndestruction and disruption have occurred. This strategy will allow work on subprojects without LAR or with \nthe simplest LAR cases early in project implementation, thus leaving adequate time to carry out more \ncomplicated LAR tasks later, after the completion of the necessary due diligence studies. \n \nB.  Resettlement Policy Framework \n \n4.  The National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) has prepared a land acquisition and \nresettlement  policy  framework  and  implementation  guideline  (LARPFPG)  for  the  ETESP,  as  the \nGovernment has yet to finalize the establishment of the proposed Implementation Coordination Board for \nAceh-North Sumatra Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (BKP), which is envisaged to be the Executing \nAgency for the ETESP. The LARPFPG will be approved by the Aceh provincial government and \nimplementing agencies. Given the ETESP\u2019s emergency assistance nature, the LARPFPG establishes \nsimplified and fast-tracked LAR implementation mechanisms consistent with ADB policies on disaster and \nemergency assistance and involuntary resettlement. 23 \n \n \n                                                 \n23   The Policy on Disaster and Emergency Assistance (OM/D7) states that ADB emergency initiatives remain \nsubject  to  the  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  though  its  implementation  may  be  simplified  and  fast-tracked. \nSpecifically, OM/D7 states that when emergency projects involve LAR and require urgent processing, Board approval \ncan be obtained based on the preparation of a resettlement framework but not, as normally required, of impact surveys \nand resettlement plans, which may be postponed until after Board approval.  \n ", "                    Appendix 6         7  7    \n           \n \n1.  Modified LAR Processing and implementation Procedures \n \n5.  Given the ETESP emergency assistance nature, LAR processing will be simplified for document \npreparation, approval, and disclosure. Table A6.1 summarizes the simplified LAR approach and compares \nit with the standard approach. \n \nTable A6.1: Simplified Land Acquisition and Resettlement Approach for the Project \n \nSimplified Approach  Comparison with Standard Approach \nDocumentation \n(i)  Initial Poverty and Social Assessment (IPSA).

ETESP Compensation Eligibility and Entitlements  \n6.  LAR will be implemented in accordance with relevant Indonesian laws and ADB policies on \ninvoluntary resettlement and disaster and emergency assistance. Though Indonesian law (Presidential \nDecree  No.  55/1993)  and  the  ADB  policies  are  generally  consistent,  they  differ  slightly  on  land \ncompensation and entitlements of informal settlers. The LARPFPG reconciles these differences by setting \ngeneral principles, compensation eligibility, entitlements, and land donation provisions that are in line with \nADB policies.  \n \n7.  Policy Principles. The LARPFPG outlines the following policy principles: (i) negative impacts will \nbe minimized as much as possible; (ii) resettlement and compensation will be carried out to improve or at \nleast restore the pre-project living standards of people affected; (iii) those affected will be thoroughly \ninformed and consulted on compensation options and resettlement plan design; (iv) land rights of women, \nwidows, orphans, and elders without family will be safeguarded; (v) LAR will be executed with thorough \nattention to titling issues; and (vi) as much compensation and resettlement subsidies as possible will be \nprovided in full prior to ground leveling and demolition.  \n \n8.  Eligibility Provisions. All affected persons  are entitled to compensation or at least rehabilitation \nunder the ETESP including (i) people losing Hak Milik (title), Guna Usaha (usufruct), Ulayat (traditional) or \nWaqf (religious) rights; (ii) informal settlers; (iii) tenants and laborers; (iv) owners of buildings, crops, or \ntrees attached to the land; and (v) people losing business income. Eligibility for compensation will be \nlimited by a cut-off date to be set for each subproject on the day corresponding to the beginning of the \nimpact assessment. Affected people who settle in the affected areas after the cut-off date will not be \neligible for compensation. \n \n9.  Entitlements. The entitlement provisions set by the LARPFPG are summarized in Table A6.2.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "                    Appendix 6         7  9    \n           \n \nTable A6.2: Entitlements Matrix \n \nAsset  Impact Category  Affected People  Compensation Entitlement \nArable   Less than 10% of land  Farmer/  Replacement value at pre- or post-tsunami rates \nLand  loss with remaining land  titleholder  (whichever is higher) in cash or in kind, free of \nstill viable  taxes or transfer costs \n    Tenant/  1 year gross harvest of land in addition to crops \nleaseholder/  compensation \nInformal settlers \n  More than 10% of land  Farmer/  Replacement value at pre-tsunami rates at pre- or \nloss   titleholder  post-tsunami rates (whichever is higher) in cash \nor in kind, free of taxes or transfer costs plus a \nsevere impact allowance equal to market value of \n1 year gross harvest of land beyond 10% \n(additional to crops compensation)  \n  Temporary losses    1 year gross harvest of land in addition to crops \ncompensation \n    Tenant/  Severe impact allowance equal to market value of \nleaseholder  1 year gross harvest of land beyond 10% \n(additional to standard tenant compensation and \ncrop compensation) \nResidential/    Titleholder  Replacement value at pre-or post- tsunami rates \nCommercial  (whichever is higher) in cash or in kind, free of \nLand  taxes, registration, or transfer costs \n    Tenant/  3-month rental allowance \nleaseholder \n    Informal settlers  A plot in a government resettlement area or a \nself-relocation allowance \nHouses,    Owners including Cash at replacement cost or kind of affected \nstructures,  informal settlers  items  \nfacilities  For partial impacts: restoration in cash of the \nstructure\u2019s affected section \n    Renters  Cash equivalent to 3 months rent at prevailing \nprices \nCrops  Crops affected by LAR   All people  Cash at full market value \naffected, \nincluding \ninformal settlers \nTrees  Trees affected by LAR  All people  Cash based on type, age, and productive value of \naffected  trees \nincluding \ninformal settlers \nBusiness/  Temporary/permanent  All people  Cash equal to 1 year\u2019s income, if the loss is \nemployment loss of business, or  affected  permanent  \nemployment   including  Cash for the time of business interruption, if the \ninformal settlers  loss is temporary  \nRelocation  Transport/livelihood  All people  Sufficient cash to cover transport costs and \ncosts  affected  by  livelihood expenses for 1 month \nrelocation \n \n10.   Land Donations. For participatory development subprojects where LAR is directly linked to direct \nbenefits for people affected, BKP may seek land procurement through voluntary donations or land \nredistribution as long as the following conditions are observed: (i) those affected donate their land based \non an informed consent, i.e., prior to their decision they have been informed of their compensation \nentitlement at market rates and actually offered the relative compensation amounts; and (ii) the donation \n ", "80   Appendix 6 \n \ndoes not affect the donor\u2019s livelihood; (iii) the voluntary aspect of the donation is documented by a \ndocument signed by the donor and verified by civil society organizations that he/she is aware of the above \nconditions. \nD.  LAR Organization and Responsibilities \n11.  Government. The Aceh governor will establish a provincial land acquisition committee for \noverall supervision of LAR policy and funding. The committee will closely coordinate with all other \nagencies involved in rehabilitation and reconstruction of Aceh and North Sumatra, and will include \nan officer in charge of issues related to ADB activities. Each district will establish a resettlement \ncommittee to be responsible for policy, valuation, and compensation issues.  \n  \n12.  Field Activities. For day-to-day management of LAR activities in the field, a land acquisition and \nresettlement unit (LARU) will be established in each district. The LARU will report to the district head, who \nwill be responsible for distributing and controlling LAR funds. The LARU will be managed by an executive \nofficer contracted from the public or private sector who has experience in participatory planning and LAR \nissues. The LARU will consist of a team of variable dimensions to meet needs in the areas of land \nplanning  and  impacts,  participatory  planning  facilitation,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  long-term \nrehabilitation planning. Village governments will support LARU activities as required. \n \n13.  Civil Society. Civil society organizations or informal institutions will assist the local governments in \nLARAP and CAP preparation and implementation tasks. Besides representing those affected, they may \nalso participate in the administration of LAR or community planning tasks under government supervision \nwhen feasible and needed.  \n \n14.  ADB. In view of the magnitude of the Aceh and North Sumatra rehabilitation and reconstruction \ntasks, ADB will open a regional office in Medan (North Sumatra) and a field facility in Banda Aceh. The \noffices will be staffed with at least one consultant with extensive experience in land administration and \nLAR, and one consultant with extensive experience in community planning. These consultants will \nfacilitate LAR and participatory planning by liaising with local governments, supervising the work of ETESP \nconsultants, and engaging in project administration tasks related to LARAP and CAP implementation. The \nconsultants will also review the documents prepared by ETESP consultants, ensure that these are \nconsistent with ADB policies, and contribute as needed to the LARAP and CAP approval process. Finally, \nthe consultants will be tasked with capacity building, training, and monitoring activities. They will ensure \nthat the PLAC, resettlement committees, and LARUs understand the requirements of the LARPFPG, and \nwill organize capacity-building workshops for LARU field teams. For monitoring, the consultants will \ncontribute as needed to the selection of external monitoring agencies, review internal and external \nmonitoring reports, and suggest solutions to eventual LAR or CAP implementation problems. ADB will \nensure that capacity in the area of gender and development is sufficient, either among the consultants or \nwith nongovernment organizations (NGOs) assisting in the rehabilitation and reconstruction activities. \n \nE.  LARAP and CAP Implementation Tasks \n \n15.  Vulnerable Groups\u2019 Issues. Households headed by women, widows, disabled persons, orphans, \nor elders without family will receive special assistance for house relocation/reconstruction and will be given \nparticular attention. During LARAP or CAP implementation, their land rights will be carefully safeguarded. \nSpecific livelihood improvement strategies for their benefit are currently under study for the post-ETESP \nperiod. These strategies, which may include employment in project activities, training, and microfinance \nloans, will be outlined in the LARAPs.  \n16.  Consultation and Participation. Based on a community-driven design, project preparation will \nbring both beneficiary communities and people affected into a continuous participatory process concerning \nLAR and community planning decisions. The LARAPs and CAPs will document this process by listing and \n ", "                    Appendix 6         8  1    \n           \n \nsummarizing all meetings, recording the number of meeting participants, and providing a signed proof of \naffected people\u2019s agreement to the decisions made. \n \n17.  Capacity Building. As the PLAC, resettlement committees, LARUs, and NGOs may have little \nexperience with ADB\u2019s resettlement policy, capacity building and training will be provided.  \n \n18.  Complaints and Grievances. Basic mechanisms and an appeals system have been agreed \nupon with the Government. Grievances will be lodged with the LARU. If the issue is not solved, the \naffected person can appeal to the LAC. If individuals remain unsatisfied, they will have right to submit the \nappeal to the provincial governor. Finally if the complaint cannot be solved at the provincial level, the \nindividual may seek satisfaction through the appropriate court of law. \n \n19.  Monitoring. LAR and the CAPs will be subjected to both internal and external monitoring. \nInternal monitoring will be conducted by the LARUs and reported to ADB through quarterly project \nimplementation reports. External monitoring will be assigned to an external monitoring agency hired \nby BKP and approved by ADB. The agency will be chosen among NGOs, academic Institutions, \nand consulting firms. Depending on BKP\u2019s preference, one agency may cover the entire ETESP or \nseveral monitoring agencies may monitor subprojects in different districts. ADB will prepare the \nterms of reference once project implementation has begun. External monitoring will be carried out \nsemi-annually, and its results reported to the LARUs and ADB. The external monitoring agency will \nalso be given evaluation tasks. After the conclusion of LAR for a subproject, the agency will prepare \nan evaluation report. Upon ETESP completion, the agency will prepare a comprehensive evaluation \nof LAR implementation. \n \nF.  Resettlement Budget and Financing \n \n20.   Land acquisition will be funded by the Government. Other costs involving compensation in kind \nwill be financed from the ETESP grant. Consulting services, surveys, and LARU personnel costs will also \nbe financed from the grant. All LAR and CAP costs will be considered as an integral part of project costs. \n \n21.  All LARAPs and CAPs will include a budget section indicating (i) unit compensation rates for \nthe different items and allowances; (ii) methodology followed for compensation rate valuation; and \n(iii) a table with all LAR/CAP costs, including administrative expenses and contingencies. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "82   Appendix 7 \n \nINDIGENOUS PEOPLE\u2019S POLICY FRAMEWORK \n \n1.  Given the pervasive damage in Aceh province and the emergency assistance nature of \nthe Earthquake and Tsunami Emergency Support Project (ETESP), the impact of the proposed \nsubprojects  on  indigenous  peoples  could  not  be  completely  assessed.  Census  data  and \nliterature indicate the groups living in the disaster-affected areas are the ethnic Acehnese, the \nLokon, Defayan and Sigulai on Simeulue, and the Nias Islands. Other groups from outside the \nregion live in the affected areas, including ethnic Javanese and ethnic groups indigenous to \nNorth Sumatra province who migrated into Aceh. The following table shows the distribution of \nethnic groups prior to the disaster.  During project preparation, the ethnic composition of the \naffected  areas  was  reviewed  by  an  anthropologist,  who  determined  that  based  on  the \ninformation available, these groups, while ethnic minorities, were sufficiently mainstreamed into \nnorthern Sumatran social and political economies. However, further investigation is needed to \nverify whether these groups or any others in the affected areas significantly differ in terms of \nculture, society, and political organization from the mainstream. The implications of any such \ndifferences will be carefully factored into project activities to ensure compliance with the Policy \non Indigenous Peoples of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nTable A7:  Dominant Ethnic Groups in the Disaster-Affected Villages in  \nAceh Province Prior to December 2004 \n \n   Number of Villages by Damage Level \nEthnic Group  Heavy  Moderate  Mild  Total \nAbal  1  1  0  2 \nAbung Bunga Mayang  0  0  1  1 \nAceh  581  665  310  1,556 \nBanten  1  0  0  1 \nDairi  6  0  0  6 \nGayo Luwes  0  2  0  2 \nGayo Serbe Jadi  0  21  0  21 \nJawa  1  8  32  41 \nKencing  0  0  1  1 \nSimeulu  0  6  0  6 \nSunda  0  1  0  1 \nNo Answer  14  3  1  18 \nSource: Badan Pusat Statistic, Aceh Province for village impact and Podes Survey \n2003 for predominant ethnic group by village. The table excludes two districts with \na small population, namely, Aceh Singkil (lightly affected) and Simeuleu (heavily \naffected).  \n2.  The general policy and procedural provisions are developed in this Indigenous Peoples \nPolicy Framework (IPPF). Specific subproject issues will be dealt with through an indigenous \npeoples  development  plan  (IPDP)  or  indigenous  peoples  specific  action  (IPA),  based  on \nintensive participatory planning. Depending on the gravity of the impact and the degree of \nindigenous people\u2019s vulnerability, an IPDP will be prepared as a stand-alone document or as \npart of the subproject development. Where required, the IPA will be prepared as part of the \nsubproject development.  \n \n 3.  The IPPF provides a general introduction to indigenous people\u2019s issues related to the \nETESP,  outlines  the  criteria  established  by  ADB\u2019s  indigenous  peoples\u2019  policy,  identifies \nindigenous people, and provides an overview of indigenous communities likely to be affected by \nthe ETESP. The IPPF also sets the policy and procedural framework relevant for the ETESP as \na whole; outlines the content of a model IPDP/IPA; and describes the strategy to be followed in \n ", "                    Appendix 7         8  3    \n           \n \ndefining the different types of initiatives fitting the degree of impact intensity and relative \nvulnerability of affected communities. \n \n4.  As for the identification criteria, the IPPF establishes that indigenous people are those \nwho in various degrees descend from groups present in specific areas before the establishment \nof modern states and relative borders, and maintain distinct self- or non-self-ascribed identities. \nThe following additional identification criteria will be used to establish the degree of vulnerability \nof affected indigenous people and the type of action to be developed for an IPDP: (i) use of \ndistinct languages, (ii) active maintenance of sociocultural systems and institutions that differ \nfrom the sociocultural system and institutional/political tradition of dominant societies, (iii) pursuit \nof livelihood in the margins of the market system, and (iv) maintenance of unique ties and \nattachments to natural resources and ancestral territories.  \n \n5.  The IPPF establishes that IPDP and IPA interventions for affected indigenous people will \nhave to (i) reflect local culture, beliefs, needs, and preferred options of affected communities; (ii) \nreflect the outcome of participatory planning methodologies; (iii) consider traditional procedures \nand functions of local institutions; (iv) fit local production systems; (v) promote self-reliance \namong the affected communities; and (vii) ensure that adequate lead time and arrangements \nare provided for implementation of such interventions. \n \n6.  The IPPF establishes that the IPDPs and IPA will be prepared by specialists familiar with \nindigenous  people  issues,  who  have  anthropological  and  sociological  expertise.  An  Adat \n(traditional law) expert is being engaged to support ETESP implementation. The IPDPs and IPA \nwill include the following:  \n \n(i)  an  indigenous  peoples  identification  assessment  describing  (a)  the  affected \ncommunity, identifying the group of indigenous people; (b) type and magnitude of \ndirect and indirect impacts; (c) number of households and people affected; (d) social \norganization; (e) livelihood and land tenure patterns; (f) history of relations with \noutsiders (including eventual  transmigrasi [migrating] communities); (g) degree of \nadaptation  to  mainstream  society  and  culture;  and  (h)  local  political  forms  and \ndegree of participation in formal state administration mechanisms;  \n \n(ii)  an  assessment  of  (a)  the  degree  of  vulnerability  of  the  affected  indigenous \ncommunities and of the type of actions needed based on the type of physical impacts \nof  a  subproject;  (b)  implementation  capacity  of  the  affected  communities,  local \ngovernment, and subproject teams; and, if necessary, (c) a capacity-building plan to \nreinforce IPDP/IPA implementation;  \n \n(iii)  documentation  of  the  participatory  planning  exercise  involving  the  affected \ncommunities,  local  governments,  subproject  teams,  and  the  line  agency  of  the \nsubproject; and  \n \n(iv)  a separate community development action plan will be required for IPDPs that (a) is \nformally  endorsed  by  the  affected  communities;  (b)  reflects  the  results  of  the \nindigenous peoples identification assessment and participatory planning activities; \nand  (c)  provides  details  on  needed  IPDP,  organization  framework,  monitoring \nscheme, implementation schedule, and budget. IPA can be identified and described \nas a separate chapter of an overall community development action plan or in the \nsubproject proposal if no action plan is required. \n \n ", "84   Appendix 7 \n \n7.  The choice between the IPDP and the IPA, and the nature of response initiatives will be \ncommensurate with the variety of indigenous people affected by a subproject, their degree of \nvulnerability, and the type of impacts:  \n \n(i)  The initiative will be limited and not require a specific community development action \nplan if (a) negative impacts affect the indigenous people who are fully integrated in \nmainstream society and culture, and are fully in control of the national or regional \nadministrative  systems;  and  (b)  impacts  do  not  have  specific  sociocultural \ndimensions. \n  \n(ii)  An IPA will be prepared to address impacts or risks when a subproject is expected to \nhave limited impacts or if there is a risk that it may not bring the intended benefits to \nthe affected indigenous people within a specific plan. The IPA will be prepared to (i) \nintegrate indigenous people (who might be excluded from the subproject) into the \nbeneficiary group and (ii) incorporate indigenous people's specific needs (that may \nnot be addressed by the subproject) into the subproject plan. \n  \n(iii)  The  IPDP  will  include,  with  the  indigenous  peoples  identification  assessment, \ndirections to compensate affected persons as needed if (a) negative impacts affect \nindigenous people groups maintaining a degree of sociocultural and institutional \ndistinction from mainstream society; and (b) impacts carry a sociocultural dimension \nbut do not have broad community effects (e.g., the houses to be reconstructed are of \na  specific  traditional  type,  or  compensation  needs  to  follow  specific  traditional \nprocedures). If the issue is related to land tenure the IPDP will be included as a \nchapter in the land acquisition and resettlement action plan. \n \n8.  The Adat specialist will carry out the indigenous peoples identification assessments in \nconjunctions with the implementing agencies for the subprojects and identify the need for IDPFs \nand IPA. These will be prepared with the support of the Adat specialist and submitted to ADB for \napproval  together  with  the  subproject  proposal  for  ETESP  financing.  The  budget  for \nimplementing  the  IPDPs  and  IPAs  will  be  included  in  the  subproject  budget.  Disclosure, \nconsultation, and grievance procedures will be described in the IDPFs and IPAs.

Areas affected by a disaster cannot heal \nthemselves without comprehensive support to restore access to basic services and enable affected people to regain a \nnormal life. The Earthquake and Tsunami Emergency Assistance Project (ETESP) covers the sectors essential to \nstemming poverty and restoring growth, and establishes a precedent for a sound rehabilitation and reconstruction \nresponse for other disaster-affected areas in the future.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting classification: General  \n      Intervention \nThe tsunami and earthquake resulted in death, injury, loss of assets, and displacement of individuals and communities in \nnorthern Sumatra. An estimated 200,000 persons are dead or missing, and 400,000 internally displaced. The primary \nimpact of the disaster was in Aceh province. The disaster followed nearly 30 years of conflict in Aceh with martial law \nimposed from 2001 to 2003. During this long period, activities by both parties resulted in kidnappings, torture, and \nkillings, as well as violence, particularly against women. While Aceh had been one of the better-off provinces, it became \nthe third poorest province out of 30 after 2001. The reconstruction and rehabilitation thus comes against a backdrop of \nconflict-traumatized communities and conflict-disrupted economy. The impact of the disaster extends beyond the \naffected 700 villages in Aceh and North Sumatra. The disaster hit a provincial capital and several significant secondary \ntowns, destroying business chains and market access for goods produced by the poor. Access to basic services was \nalso disrupted by damage to buildings, equipment, vehicles, and roads, and by deaths and injuries of skilled people. \nTeachers and nurses suffered heavily in the disaster as they were the first to respond to the emergency. Destruction of \nhouses and buildings stripped individuals and communities of shelter and places to undertake business and participate \nin public and social life. The remaining infrastructure is being strained as are receiving families and communities \nproviding temporary support to those displaced. Strains on receiving communities combined with unclear and varying \nexternal support may lead to conflicts between those indirectly and directly affected. Following the immediate relief \nefforts, a comprehensive plan must to be implemented to restore access to economic and social life. The ETESP is \nessential to restore the region on a path toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?  X  Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?  X  Yes                   No \n \nThe participation process has started at the central planning level. A master plan for rehabilitation and reconstruction of \nAceh and North Sumatra reconstruction is being developed by the Government in consultation with civil society. At the \nETESP level, the needs have been identified through a joint donor-government damage assessment process. The \ndetailed planning, implementation, and monitoring for community infrastructure will be undertaken with consultation and \nparticipation of the target communities.  \n \nFor some sectors, such as shelter, the community will be defined by geographic and administrative boundaries, i.e., the \nvillage. For other sectors, the community will  be defined on the basis of social structures such as water user \nassociations, farmer groups, and fisher organizations. The relevant community will be involved in the design and \nimplementation of the subproject. Efforts will be made to work with and strengthen existing local community institutions. \n \n ", "86  Appendix 8 \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \n           The principal concern is for women to have equitable access to social life and livelihood restoration. Women have \nparticular vulnerabilities and responsibilities due to their reproductive, child rearing, and family-nurturing role. Women are \nalso subject to violence in situations where social order has been disrupted, such as during a period of conflict and \ndisaster. The 30-year conflict in Aceh has resulted in a high rate of households headed by women and internal \ndisplacement. As a result, many women are required by necessity to take all responsibility for supporting the household. \nThe disaster has resulted in an increase in the proportion of fragmented families, and more women will find themselves \nalone or the sole support for their families. Reconstruction and rehabilitation support must address women\u2019s special \nneeds and those related to the household, i.e., reproductive health, shelter, and water supply and sanitation. It must also \naddress their need for livelihood restoration. \n \nNormative values in common currency, particularly among the Acehnese, would suggest that women are \nconfined to a limited economic sphere. The adoption of Sharia law in 2003 in Aceh province reinforces these \nperceptions. In practical terms, women in the disaster-affected area are important but invisible actors in the local \neconomy. Without a gender screen, key opportunities to restore women to social and economic life are likely to be \npassed over. Project interventions should aim at (i) ensuring that women\u2019s roles in the local economy and business \nchain are clearly identified so that opportunities for support and restoration are not overlooked, and (ii) promoting access \nfor restoration of women\u2019s assets and economic activities. \n \n  Rehabilitation programs aim to restore affected persons to a higher level of well-being than before the disaster. \nProject implementation must respect local norms while promoting women to have a larger role in social and economic \nlife. Some local cultural traditions provide access and social protection. For example, women may have special forest \nareas for collecting firewood or gathering medicinal plants, and the house is traditionally a female asset. Local customs \nthat protect women should be understood and reinforced.  \n \n  The ETESP components are still in a relatively general form. Hence the gender action plan, at this stage of \ndevelopment, is in the form of recommendations rather than specific actions and targets. Specific gender action plans \nwill be developed for the subproject components as they are finalized. They will aim to (i) protect women\u2019s rights to \nassets and opportunities, (ii) balance pressures to promote normative values constraining women that are against their \npractical needs and aspirations, and (iii) provide specific support to develop business and entrepreneurial skills to female \nhouseholds.  \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?
