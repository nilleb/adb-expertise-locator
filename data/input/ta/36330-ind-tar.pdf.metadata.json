The  Government  of  India  has  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to prepare the proposed Railway Sector Investment Program for \npossible ADB financing. The Fact-Finding Mission visited India 6\u201310 August 2007 and met with \nthe Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Railways (MOR). \nThis  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  was  developed  based  on  the \nGovernment\u2019s concurrence with the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \ncost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  (TOR).  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Indian economy has become a leading global performer in recent years as reforms \ninitiated in 1991 significantly increased its growth rates. The long-term trend rate of growth rose \nfrom 3.5% in the 1950s\u20131970s to 5.4% in the 1980s, 6% in the 1990s, and more than 8% in \nrecent  years.  This  led  to  a  decrease  in  poverty  incidence\u2014recent  Planning  Commission \nestimates indicate that poverty incidence has fallen from 36% in 1993\u20131994 to 27% in 2004\u2013\n2005.2 However, poverty remains high, and faster economic development is needed to generate \nthe  resources  required  to  reduce  its  incidence.  The  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan  (2007\u20132012) \nemphasizes physical and social infrastructure development to promote broad-based economic \ngrowth,  develop  agriculture  and  the  rural  economy,  and  safeguard  the  competitiveness  of \nindustry and services. During the plan\u2019s period, investment in infrastructure must be raised from \n4.6% of the gross domestic product to about 8% to sustain an overall growth rate of 9% per \nannum.  \n \n3.  The inadequacy of India\u2019s transport infrastructure is constraining the country\u2019s growth. \nTransport infrastructure development programs are high priorities for the Government, making \nADB\u2019s  strategy  of  reducing  poverty  through  infrastructure-led  growth  especially  relevant. \nRailways are a significant component of India\u2019s transport sector\u2014in FY2006, railways carried \n5.73  billion  passengers  and  666.51  million  tons  of  freight,  increases  of  6.5%  and  10.7%, \nrespectively, over the previous fiscal year. \n \n4.  Indian  Railways  (IR)  faces  capacity  constraints  and  needs  to  augment  capacity  on \ncritical routes, e.g., along the Golden Quadrilateral and diagonals that connect the cities of New \nDelhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai. Capacity constraints must be alleviated by an increase in \nand more efficient utilization of the physical infrastructure. Doubling and quadrupling rail tracks \non critical routes would increase the physical infrastructure, while the introduction of modern \nsignaling systems that can increase the capacity of the existing tracks would improve the \nefficiency of infrastructure usage. \n  \n5.  Although the absolute amount of funds allocated for IR has increased over the years, the \nfunds allocated to the railways as a percentage of the total allocation decreased from 7% in the \nEighth Plan to 4% in the Tenth Plan. Therefore, it is imperative for IR to generate more funds \nthrough its operations to finance the needed expansion programs. The results of the accounting \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 16 August 2007.  \n2 Based on consumption expenditure data collected during the National Sample Survey Organisation\u2019s 61st round \nusing a 30-day recall period for all items, e.g., the uniform recall period consumption distribution.  \n \n ", "2   \nreforms  currently  being  implemented  can  facilitate  greater  commercialization  of  railway \noperations, thereby increasing revenue generation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact of the PPTA will be to enhance the carrying capacity and organizational \nefficiency of IR by double-tracking existing railway lines in critical sections and electrifying other \nlines. Efficiency improvements to enhance the commercialization of railway operations and \ndecision making also will be prepared. The outcome of the PPTA will be to formulate the agreed \ndesign for a proposed investment program, using the multitranche financing facility (MFF), and \nto prepare the first two loan tranches under this investment program.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  Engineering  and  Project  Management  Analysis.  The  PPTA  will  (i)  review  the \ntechnical  and  engineering  aspects  of  the  techno-economic  studies  prepared  by  IR  for  the \nproposed projects under the first two loans of the investment program, and assess whether the \nstudies are based on uniform design methodologies and standards; (ii) visit project sites as \nnecessary; (iii) carry out an institutional assessment of Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. (RVNL), the likely \nImplementing Agency (IA) as well as other implementing agencies identified by MOR, focusing \non the suitability of the staff\u2019s strength and expertise, as well as RVNL\u2019s and other identified IA\u2019s \nauthority for successful project management; and (iv) prepare contract packages that optimize \nthe  construction  periods  of  the  packages  by  expediting  disbursement  and  minimizing \ncommitment charges to be paid by the Government  on the outstanding balance of the proposed \nloan. \n \n8.  Economic and Sector Analysis. The PPTA will (i) supplement IR\u2019s efforts to ensure \nthat the economic analyses of the proposed projects are carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects; (ii) review and improve as necessary IR\u2019s \nstudies,  including  the  traffic  forecast,  cost  estimates,  and  benefits;  (iii)  perform  additional \nsurveys as necessary; and (iv) recalculate the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and carry \nout sensitivity analyses with the projects\u2019 risk assessments;  \n \n9.  Financial  Analysis. The PPTA will (i) carry out financial analyses of the proposed \nprojects in accordance with the Guidelines on the Financial Governance and Management of \nInvestment Projects Financed by ADB; (ii) review project cost estimates, propose a financing \nplan, prepare financial projections and the financial internal rate of return (FIRR), and compare \nthe FIRR with the weighted average cost of capital; (iii) conduct sensitivity analysis with the \nprojects\u2019 risk assessments; and (iv)  assess the financial management  of RVNL and other \nidentified IA to determine its capability for efficient project management, including financial \nmanagement and control systems. \n \n10.  Environmental  Assessment.  The  PPTA  will  prepare  feasibility  studies,  including \nenvironmental impact assessments (EIA) or initial environmental examinations (IEE), for each \nprojects proposed for financing by the first two loans of this proposed investment program. \nImportant considerations in undertaking an environmental assessment include (i) examining \nalternatives; (ii) identifying potential environmental impacts, including direct and cumulative \nimpacts, and assessing their significance; (iii) achieving environmental standards; (iv) designing \nleast-cost mitigation measures; (v) developing appropriate environmental management plans \n ", "  3\nand  monitoring  requirements;  (vi)  formulating  institutional  arrangements;  and  (vii)  ensuring \ninformation disclosure, meaningful public consultation, and appropriate reporting of results. The \nTA consultants will carry out the environmental assessments closely following the relevant \nrequirements of the Government and ADB, and using appropriate environmental assessments \nalready undertaken by IR. Environmental assessments will refine the investment program\u2019s \neligibility criteria, including specific environmental criteria and concerns that must be examined \ncarefully  during  subproject  selection,  design,  appraisal,  and  implementation.  For  each \nenvironmentally sensitive subproject, a summary EIA or summary IEE will be formulated based \non the subproject\u2019s EIA and IEE.  \n \n11.  Social Impact and Resettlement Analysis. The PPTA will assist in identifying social \nissues, e.g., involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples, in each proposed project and in \nformulating required planning instruments, e.g., resettlement framework (RF), indigenous (tribal) \npeoples development framework (IPDF), resettlement plans (RPs), and indigenous peoples \ndevelopment plans (IPDP). In formulating such planning instruments, the TA consultants will \nclosely  follow  national  and  state-level  land  acquisition,  compensation,  relocation,  and \nrehabilitation  policies,  laws,  and  regulations.  With  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  and  state \ngovernment authorities, the consultants will ensure that the RF and IPDF adequately address \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995)  and  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998) \nsafeguards, respectively. The EA and ADB will review the frameworks before approving them. \nBased on the approved RF and IPDF, the PPTA consultants will formulate an RP for each of the \nsix proposed projects that will have involuntary resettlement impacts, and an IPDP or \u201cspecial \naction\u201d for each proposed project that will impact indigenous peoples. The RF and IPDF will be \ndisclosed on the ADB website. The RPs will be disclosed to all affected persons and project \nstakeholders and posted on the ADB website before project appraisal. The summary initial \npoverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n \n12.  Sector Analysis and Efficiency Improvement Analysis. The PPTA will (i) identify \nincremental  efficiency  improvements  to  enhance  IR\u2019s  financial  and  operational  efficiency, \nincluding promoting greater commercialization and better aligning its organizational structure \nwith its core activities; (ii) identify new measures that emerge from the implementation of IR\u2019s \naccounting reforms so that the new accounting system\u2019s output is used for improved investment \nand operational decision making; (iii) carry out the ADB-required analysis of the railway sector \nto process follow-on projects using the MFF modality, including preparing the sector road map \nshowing  the  sector\u2019s  current  status,  and  objectives,  and  the  \nmedium-  and  long-term  envisioned  status,  and  identifying  the  sector\u2019s  strengths  and \nweaknesses. The sector road map will also discuss the bottlenecks to improvement, the risks \nand areas in which improvement is required, and the strategy for improving the sector and \nidentifying the sector objectives. The investment program will be based on the Eleventh Plan\u2019s \ninvestment plans for railways and should show (i) the sequencing of the investments, (ii) the \napproach used to finance this investment and development plan, (iii) analysis of the efficiency \nimprovement measures identified in the Eleventh Plan and annual budget plans, and (iv) railway \nsector capacity development measures necessary to process follow-on projects using the MFF \nmodality. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $1.25 million equivalent, comprising $480,000 \nin foreign exchange cost and $770,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The details of the cost \nestimates are in Appendix 3. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance $250,000 equivalent \n ", "4   \nby providing office accommodation, support facilities, counterpart staff, maps, reports, and other \nlogistical support. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  MOR, as the EA, will appoint a project director responsible for day-to-day supervision of \nthe PPTA. The Government will provide the required counterpart staff; office space; furniture; \nsupport facilities for surveys, maps, and reports; and other support services to the consultants in \na timely manner. All equipment for the PPTA will be procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and will be turned over to MOR upon PPTA \ncompletion. \n \n15.  An  international  consulting  firm  that  can  supply  a  team  with  expertise  in  railway \nengineering and economic analysis of transport projects will be recruited for the PPTA. National \nconsultants in these two fields, financial analysis and social analysis will be engaged by the \ninternational consulting firm, which will have overall responsibility for these PPTA components. \nIndividual consultants will be recruited to carry out social, poverty impact, and resettlement \nanalyses;  EIAs;  and  studies  of  efficiency  improvement  measures.  As  envisaged,  11.5  \nperson-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  40.0  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services will be required. ADB will recruit the consultants in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The consulting firm \nwill  be  selected  according  to  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures,  and  simplified \ntechnical  proposals  will  be  requested  from  short-listed  firms.  Biodata  proposals  will  be \nrequested from consultants recruited as individuals.  \n \n16.  This PPTA will prepare the investment program\u2019s design and the first two loans under \nthe program using the MFF. The remaining loans under the program will be prepared using a \nsubsequent PPTA. The outline (TOR) for consultants are in Appendix 4. The PPTA is expected \nto start in February 2008 and will be completed by June 2008. The projects to be studied in this \nPPTA are all doubling projects except for one electrification project and are shown in the outline \nTOR. Seminars and workshops will be held to disseminate the output of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of India for preparing the Railway Sector Investment Program, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n ", "  Appendix 1  55 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData \nDesign  Performance  Assumptions \nSources/Reporting \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \n  Capacity in project  Railway transport   \nEnhance IR\u2019s  corridors increases by a  statistics  \u2022  Project will be \ncarrying capacity and  minimum of 20%    implemented on time \norganizational    Surveys  \u2022  Measures to improve \nefficiency     efficiency and \n  Progress reports  commercial orientation \nwill be implemented \n \nRisks \n \n\u2022  Suboptimal \nimplementation of \nefficiency \nimprovement \nmeasures \n\u2022  Economic growth \nfalters resulting in \nlower traffic volumes \n \nOutcome      Assumption \n  Submission of  Tripartite meetings   \nAgreed design for the  acceptable technical,    \u2022  Consultants\u2019 \nensuing investment  economic, and financial  Progress reports  performance is \nprogram using MFF  analyses    satisfactory \nmodality    Final reports   \n  Preparation of EIA, \n  environmental mitigation, \nsocial analysis, RP, and \nRF \n \nPreparation of sector \nanalysis and efficiency \nimprovement measures \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \n \nData \nDesign  Performance  Assumptions \nSources/Reporting \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  and Risks \nMechanisms \nOutputs      Assumption \n  Consultant report covering  Tripartite meetings   \n1.

These rates of poverty are of particular concern as the \nIndian economy has experienced relatively high rates of growth in recent years. While rural poverty rates, at 28%, are \nhigher than urban poverty levels of about 26%, the absolute number of urban poor has increased by 4 million while the \nnumber of rural poor has decreased by more than 20 million over the decade 1993\u20131994 to 2004\u20132005.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  consultants  for  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-financed  Railway  Sector \nInvestment Program project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will formulate a consensual \ndesign of the investment program using the multitranche financing facility (MFF), and prepare \nprojects for the first two loan tranches under this program for possible ADB financing. These \nprojects  involve  doubling  six  existing  railway  lines  and  electrifying  one  other  railway  line.  To \ncomplement  these  physical  investments  and  a  railway  sector  analysis,  the  PPTA  will  also \nrecommend  and  formulate  an  implementation  plan  for  efficiency  improvements  in  railway \norganization, work processes, and procedures. The consultants will build on feasibility studies \ncarried out by Indian Railways (IR). However, where necessary to meet ADB standards and \nrequirements, the consultants will also conduct primary data collection and analysis. \n \nB.  Scope of Work \n \n2.
