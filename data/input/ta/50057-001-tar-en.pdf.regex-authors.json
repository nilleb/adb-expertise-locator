INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC), Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3) launched the Asian Bond Markets \nInitiative (ABMI) in December 2002 to (i) foster the development of local currency bond markets \nas  an  alternative  source  of  funding  to  short-term  foreign  currency  loans,  and  (ii)  promote \nregional  financial  cooperation  and  integration  for  a  more  resilient  financial  system.  More \ndeveloped local currency bond markets would (i) help the ASEAN+3 region mobilize savings to \nmeet its long-term investment needs, particularly for infrastructure development; and (ii) reduce \nits vulnerability to the sudden reversal of capital inflows, thereby strengthening the region\u2019s \nfinancial stability. Since the launching of the ABMI, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nprovided technical support for this initiative as secretariat. The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Significant progress has been made by the region in developing local currency bond \nmarkets since 2002. The amount of outstanding local currency bonds in ASEAN plus the PRC \nand  the  Republic  of  Korea  grew  from  $1.1  trillion  in  2002  to  $10.4  trillion  by  the  end  of \nSeptember 2016. As a percentage of gross domestic product, local currency bonds outstanding \nrose  to  69.9%  in  September  2016  from  42.6%  in  end-2003  across  the  region  in  newly \ndeveloped markets such as Viet Nam and in more advanced markets like the Republic of Korea. \nYield curves have not only become more reliable, but they have also been gradually lengthened \nacross the region. Restrictions have been removed to allow a greater range of entities to issue \nlocal currency bonds to meet funding needs. There is also a greater variety in the types of \nbonds  being  issued\u2014including  inflation-linked  bonds,  asset-backed  securities,  and  Islamic \nbonds\u2014in debt markets in the region. \n \n3.  Local currency bond markets have now become the key source of funding (i) for the \nauthorities to fund public sector programs in Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the \nPhilippines, and Thailand; and (ii) for highly rated corporates to meet their financing needs. The \nCredit Guarantee and Investment Facility, a credit enhancement facility for companies seeking \nto issue local currency-denominated bonds launched by ASEAN+3 under the ABMI in 2010, has \nissued 16 credit guarantees (amounting to $1,024 million) for bonds issued by seven companies \nin six ASEAN member countries, and its board approved two additional guarantees amounting \nto $170 million in 2016. As its guarantee capacity will likely reach its limit by 2017, member \ncountries are in the process of deciding on the next steps, including capital increase. \n \n4.  Information  on  individual  bond  markets  across  ASEAN+3  is  now  available  on  the \nAsianBondsOnline website in the form of the ASEAN+3 Bond Market Guide. Regulations across \nASEAN+3 have markedly improved and, where practical, would be harmonized to facilitate \ncross-border  bond  issuance  and  investment.  Under  the  ASEAN+3  Multi-Currency  Bond \nIssuance Framework,2 the first cross-border pilot bond was issued in 2015 in Thailand by \nMizuho Bank for B3 billion. The market infrastructure required to support bond markets, ranging \nfrom the credit rating to the settlement and clearance, has been put in place and will benefit \nfrom additional work to be undertaken under the Cross-Border Settlement Infrastructure Forum.3 \n                                                \n1  The technical assistance first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 August 2016. \n2  The framework was established to facilitate cross-border bond issuance by making it possible for qualified issuers \nfrom ASEAN+3 to issue bonds in any participating member country with standardized documentation and well-\ndefined implementation procedures. \n3  The forum was established to improve cross-border settlement of bonds. \n ", "2  \n \n5.  To further advance the objectives of the ABMI, the ASEAN+3 finance ministers and \ncentral bank governors recently approved a medium-term road map outlining activities to be \nsupported from 2016 to 2018. In particular, ASEAN+3 will continue to foster the development of \nlocal currency bond markets to promote financial stability and meet the long-term investment \nneeds of the region by expanding the use of local currency bonds to address three key areas of \nfinancing gaps in the region: (i) small and medium-sized enterprises, (ii) housing, and (iii) \ninfrastructure. Activities under the medium-term road map will also seek to advance regional \nmarket integration. \n \n6.  Building on achievements that promote the use of local currency bonds for infrastructure \nfinance,  ASEAN+3  policy  makers  are  exploring  options  to  promote  green  local  currency-\ndenominated bonds to meet the region\u2019s infrastructure development needs. The policy makers \nhave included the promotion of these bonds as an activity to support in the medium term under \nthe ABMI. \n \n7.  Financing infrastructure projects with green local currency-denominated bonds is highly \ndesirable for the following reasons. First, financing infrastructure projects with long-term local \ncurrency bonds instead of short-term bank loans denominated in foreign currency would make \nthe projects less vulnerable to currency and refinancing risks, especially as they generate \nrevenue in the local currency. Without hedging, which comes with a cost and may not be \navailable for longer-dated tenors in all currencies, adverse exchange rate movements can \nincrease debt service requirements relative to local currency revenue, potentially threatening the \nviability of a project. Second, ASEAN+3 has a significantly large demand for infrastructure but is \nexposed to a range of climate conditions and extreme events. Because of this, green bonds\u2014\nthe fixed-income instruments where the proceeds raised are used to finance clearly defined \nprojects that have environmental benefits, including renewable energy, water conservation, \nenergy efficiency, green buildings, clean transport, and sustainable land use\u2014supported within \nthe framework of ASEAN+3 would not only help meet the long-term financing of the region, but \ncould become an effective investment tool to finance its transition to a low-carbon region. \n \n8.  Green bond markets have recently been developed and, as they have grown, it has \nbecome  essential  for  the  markets  to  establish  an  industry-wide  framework  to  define  what \nconstitutes a green bond. As a result, the Green Bond Principles (GBPs) were prepared by a \ngroup of leading financial institutions to provide voluntary guidelines for issuers and underwriters \nas benchmarks for green bonds. The GBPs have four components: (i) use of proceeds, (ii) \nprocess for project evaluation and selection, (iii) management of proceeds, and (iv) reporting. In \naddition, the GBPs recommend that issuers have independent third parties conduct external \nassurance to confirm that the issuance is aligned with the four components of the GBPs. As \ngreen bond markets are rapidly developing across sectors and geographies, the GBPs have to \nbe revised and updated, as required, to remain relevant. \n \n9.  While the GBPs identify the type of projects that would qualify as green bonds, they do \nnot define the criteria for the environmental impact and additionality of the projects, and this has \nsometimes raised concerns about greenwashing by issuers. To meet requirements for investors, \na number of organizations, including the Climate Bonds Initiative, are developing standards to \ndefine what is considered \u201cgreen.\u201d These standards, however, are based on the GBPs, and \nbonds issued using these standards are referred to as climate bonds that require certification. \nNevertheless, as there are additional costs to issue green bonds (e.g., establishing segregated \ntreasury accounts, reporting, seeking a second-party opinion, and paying a certification fee in \ncase of climate bonds), benefits for green issuers, including a more diversified investor base \n ", "3 \nand sustainability credentials, would have to be greater than the costs to encourage issuers to \ntap green debt markets. \n \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  impact  will  be  strengthened  financial  stability  and  support  to  sustainable \ndevelopment in the region. The outcome will be increased green local currency-denominated \nbonds for infrastructure finance. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The technical assistance (TA) will include the following activities: \n \n(i)  Study and provide an assessment on green bond markets in ASEAN+3, including \nexisting  and  potential  investors  and  market  size,  and  the  underlying  factors \ndetermining their demand; and recommend measures to increase regional and \ndomestic investors\u2019 awareness of green bond benefits to raise the demand for \ngreen bonds. \n \n(ii)  Identify the existing issuers and potential issuers of green bonds in ASEAN+3, \ndetermine  the  additional  costs  of  issuing  green  bonds  compared  with \nconventional  local  currency-denominated  bonds,  and  assess  the  potential \nbenefits green bond issuers could gain from tapping green debt markets. \n \n(iii)  Review how green bonds are issued in ASEAN+3 member countries and assess \nwhether the GBPs have been used to guide green bond issuance, including (a) \nto what extent the proceeds of the bonds have been used for green projects, and \n(b) whether the designated green project categories provide clear environmental \nbenefits that could be assessed and quantified by the issuer. Based on the \nfindings, recommend measures to (i) promote issuance of green bonds based on \nthe  GBPs  at the  national  and  regional  levels,  and  (ii)  scale  up green  bond \nmarkets for infrastructure development in ASEAN+3. \n \n(iv)  Present and disseminate the findings and recommendations in para. 11 (i)-(iii)  to \npolicy  makers  and  market  regulators  in  ASEAN+3  member  countries  for \nconsideration. \n \n(v)  In  consultation  with  market  participants,  prepare  a  feasibility  study  on \nestablishing  an  ASEAN+3  green  bonds  collective  investment  schemes  (CIS) \nsuch as exchange traded fund consisting of green local currency-denominated \nbonds issued by sovereign and quasi-sovereign entities in ASEAN+3 (example is \nthe Asian Bond Fund 2 of the Executives\u2019 Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central \nBanks4) to promote and facilitate investment in green bonds issued within the \n                                                \n4  Asian Bond Fund 2 is an exchange traded fund of sovereign bonds issued by eight member countries of The \nExecutives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific central banks which is a cooperative organization of central banks and \nmonetary authorities in the East Asia and Pacific region. It comprises the central banks of 11 economies: Reserve \nBank of Australia, People's Bank of China, Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Bank Indonesia, Bank of Japan, The \n ", "4  \nregion. Provide criteria on the type of bonds the CIS could invest in for the \nselected bonds to meet the GBPs. \n \n(vi)  In  close  collaboration  with  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change \nDepartment  (SDCC)  staff  and  based  on  discussion  with  green  bond  index \nproviders, prepare a feasibility study on establishing an ASEAN+3 green bonds \nindex  to  track  the  regional  green  bond  market,  including  the  potential \nmethodology and types of bonds to be included in the index for the selected \nbonds to meet the GBPs. The proposed ASEAN+3 green bonds index could be \neffectively used as a performance measure for the ASEAN+3 green bonds CIS \nand other green and broad-based investors. \n \n12.  Output 1: ASEAN+3 regional studies developed and disseminated. The TA team will \nconduct  a  study  on  green  bond  markets  in  ASEAN+3,  including  the  underlying  factors \ndetermining the demand and supply of green bonds, and whether the GBPs have been used as \nguidelines for green bond issuance. The study will also recommend measures to promote the \nuse of green bonds for infrastructure development in the region. Additionally, the TA team will \nconduct two feasibility studies on the establishment of a green bond index in ASEAN+3 and \nASEAN+3 green bonds CIS. The findings of the studies will be discussed with and provided to \npolicy makers in the region for their consideration in support of their efforts to promote green \nbonds in their respective countries.   \n \n13.  Output 2: Capacity of ASEAN+3 government staff enhanced. Training of at least 5 \nperson-days  will  be  conducted for  three groups  of policy  makers from  ASEAN+3 member \ncountries  that  are  at  the  same  stage  of  market  development  to  help  them  address  the \nchallenges identified with policy recommendations by the studies as highlighted in output 1. \n \n14.  Risks. Project risks include the following: (i) there is unsustained commitment to green \nfinancing  policies  by  member  countries,  and  (ii)  lack  of  data  compromises  the  quality  of \nrecommendations made by the studies as highlighted in output 1. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  Regional  Cooperation  and  Poverty  Reduction  Fund  and \nadministered by ADB. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. The Financial Cooperation and Integration \nTeam of the Office of the Director General under the SDCC will implement the TA in close \ncoordination with ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department, East Asia Department, Private Sector \nOperations Department, and Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department. The \nproject will be implemented over 24 months from January 2017 to December 2018. \n \n17.  The TA implementation will be monitored and assessed by representatives from the \nPRC  and Thailand,  which  are  the  co-chairs  of  the  ABMI Task  Force  1  on  Promoting  the \nIssuance (Supply) of Local Currency-Denominated Bonds. Once the studies are completed, \n                                                                                                                                                       \nBank of Korea, Bank Negara Malaysia, Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Monetary \nAuthority of Singapore, and Bank of Thailand. \n ", "5 \nthey will be circulated to other member countries for review and endorsement. The seminars will \nthen be held to discuss and disseminate the TA findings to policy makers and regulators in the \nregion for their  consideration. The  co-chairs  of the  ABMI  Task  Force  1  on  Promoting the \nIssuance (Supply)  of  Local  Currency-Denominated  Bonds  will  also  report the findings  and \nrecommendations under the studies as highlighted in output 1 to the ASEAN+3 Deputy Finance \nMinisters and Central Bank Governors for their endorsement. \n \n18.  The  TA  will  require  9  person-months  of  individual  international  consulting  services \ncomprising (i) 4 person-months for the financial market specialist, (ii) 3 person-months for the \ninstitutional investor, and (iii) 2 person-months for the capital market specialist. Additionally, the \nTA will require 16 person-months of individual national consulting services for the research \nanalyst, who will provide support on data and information on infrastructure bonds, help monitor \nthe  progress  of  the  TA,  and  organize  meetings  and  workshops  to  support  and  assist \ninternational consultants and the SDCC. \n \n19.  Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for \nconsultants is in Appendix 3. Disbursement under the TA project will be made in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). SDCC staff will regularly monitor and administer the individual contracts, and manage the \ncombined outputs. If ADB staff act as resource persons, the TA will cover only their travel \ncosts.5 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the People's Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction \nFund for Promoting Green Local Currency-Denominated Bonds for Infrastructure Development \nin ASEAN+3, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n5  A  memo  from  ADB\u2019s  Budget,  Personnel,  and  Management  Systems  Department  and  Strategy  and  Policy \nDepartment (26 June 2013) provides guidance on charging costs to TA and internal administrative expense \nbudgets. It states that for preparatory works, implementation, and administrative support, ADB staff are not eligible \nto charge corresponding salaries and benefits to the TA. If the TA paper clearly specifies in its cost estimates that it \nwill provide support such as travel and administrative expenses, then such costs should be charged to the TA. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nFinancial stability and support to sustainable development in the ASEAN+3 region strengtheneda. \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2019:     \nGreen local currency- Share of green bonds  Data from the  Unsustained \ndenominated bonds  issuance for infrastructure  International Capital  commitment to green \nfor infrastructure  projects in ASEAN+3  Market Association  financing policies \nfinance increased  increased to at least 1.5% \nMarket consultations \n(2016 baseline: 0.1%) \nwith ASEAN+3 member \ncountries \nABMI Task Force and \nASEAN+3 Deputy \nFinance Ministers and \nCentral Bank Governors\u2019 \nMeeting (Deputies\u2019 \nMeeting)  \nTA progress reports \nOutputs  By December 2018:     \n1.
