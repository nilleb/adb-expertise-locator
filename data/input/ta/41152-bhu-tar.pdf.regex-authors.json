The Government has been making steady progress in improving the country\u2019s public \nfinancial management system to support Bhutan\u2019s economic and social development. In 2006, \nthe Office of the Auditor General was established, and the Audit Act was approved. This act \nestablished the Royal Audit Authority (RAA) under the Auditor General, which is responsible for \npromoting the efficient use of public resources. Further, the 2007 draft constitution mandates \nthat  RAA  audit  all  government  department  accounts  as  well  as  the  country\u2019s  revenues, \nadvances, and reserves. Under the June 2007 Public Finance Act (PFA), the Government is \ncommitted to various fiscal objectives, including sustainable and transparent fiscal management \nand a sound budgeting and accounting system. The approval of the constitution, scheduled for \n2008, is expected to lead to additional public finance improvements including a fiscal transfer \nframework from central to subnational administrations, particularly the dzongkhag (district) level.  \n \n2.  Vision  20201 aims  to  ensure  the  country\u2019s  future  independence,  sovereignty,  and \nsecurity  through  good  governance  and  rapid  economic  growth.  To  support  Vision  2020\u2019s \nimplementation, the Government adopted the Ninth Five-Year Plan (FYP) for fiscal year (FY) \n2002\u20132007,  which  advocates  the  adoption  of  various  rules  and  regulations  to  encourage \neconomic  growth.  The  draft  Tenth  FYP  is  under  preparation  and  is  expected  to  provide \ncontinuity in support of Vision 2020.   \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010) for \nBhutan2 includes two strategic thrusts: (i) lending assistance focusing on transport, power, \nurban development, and private sector development; and (ii) nonlending assistance for capacity \nbuilding  for  sustainable  development,  including  enhancing  debt  and  public  resource \nmanagement capacity. Strengthening RAA has also been mentioned as a key area of required \ncapacity development.  \n \n4.  At the request of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and RAA, two missions were fielded in \nAugust and November 2007, and the technical assistance (TA) paper was prepared based on \ntheir findings.3 The TA is consistent with the country strategy and program and Vision 2020. \nThis TA is also included in the Bhutan Country Operations Business Plan 2007\u20132009 as a \ncluster TA.4 The design and monitoring framework is included in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n5.  The Government\u2019s immediate challenge is developing procedures to implement the PFA, \nas financial rules and regulations (FRRs) are deemed too complex to execute. MOF plans to \nreview FRRs and to simplify and segregate them into manuals. MOF will then prioritize capacity \ndevelopment in the various FRRs, particularly at the line ministry and district levels, to support \nimplementation. Work has already started with respect to one of the seven FRRs on finance and \naccounting under an ADB-supported regional TA.5  \n \n                                                 \n1  Royal Government of Bhutan. 1999. Bhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and Happiness. Available: \nhttp://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/APCITY/UNPAN005249.pdf. \n2  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010): Kingdom of Bhutan. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 23 November 2007. \n4  ADB. 2006. Country Operations Business Plan (2007\u20132009): Kingdom of Bhutan. Manila. \n5  See Project 1 (Bhutan: Support for Anticorruption and Good Governance at Local Level) under ADB. 2006. \nProposed Technical Assistance for the Development Partnership Program for South Asia (Financed by the \nAustralia-ADB South Asia Development Partnership Facility). Manila (TA 6337-REG approved on 18 August). \n ", "2 \n6.  Fiscal programming is another challenge facing MOF due to the development budget\u2019s \ngrowing size, lumpy investments and borrowings, and resulting revenues, which stem in part \nfrom accommodating in the budget large infrastructure projects. In addition, a major share of the \ndevelopment budget is from large, irregular, and lumpy  donor funds, which\u2014given project \nimplementation  capacity  constraints\u2014add  uncertainty  to  budget  implementation  and \ndisbursements. Fiscal programming thus requires formulating budgets within a medium- to long-\nterm framework to accommodate sudden spikes in capital spending and debt build-up that drive \nunpredictable investment requirements. In particular, expenditure management must control \nexpansion in outlays and revenues once large infrastructure projects are commissioned. In \nresponse,  the  Government  presented  the  FY2007  budget  based  on  a  medium-term  fiscal \nframework and has begun to work towards a multi-year rolling framework with World Bank \nsupport. \n \n7.  As part of its obligations under PFA, MOF requires improved expenditure management, \nincluding closer monitoring of flow of funds.6 At present, funds reporting to the Department of \nPublic Accounts (DPA) following disbursement of current expenditure may take up to 45 days \nafter the end of the quarter. This is particularly the case for spending at the dzongkhag level. In \naddition to capacity constraints, reasons for these delays include deficiencies in the budget and \naccounting system (BAS), frequent system breakdowns, and inconsistencies between BAS \nreports and auditor requirements\u2014which leads to the continuing use of manual bookkeeping. \nDPA is seeking assistance to enhance the BAS to enable funds disbursement and real-time \nreporting. A possible solution is to connect the BAS to a telephone line dial-up system, enabling \nDPA to access data at the dzongkhag and eventually gewog (local) levels. This would allow \nexperts to assist local officers in troubleshooting, which will reduce delays in fund reporting.  \n \n8.  Another  important  reform  initiative  under  DPA  consideration  is  treasury  account \nconsolidation. To date, the Treasury operates around 1,000 bank accounts for expenditure \nfinancing, which are linked to five consolidated funds. While netting of accounts occurs daily, \nthere  are  potential  fiscal  savings  in  the  identification  of  and  quick  access  to  liquid  funds \navailable in various accounts. \n \n9.  More generally, there is potential for increasing fiscal savings from developing improved \ncash  management  operations  at  DPA  and  building  on  the  annual  public  sector  borrowing \nrequirement. The Capital Market National Task Force was created in FY2006 to develop a \nframework to identify the demand for domestic borrowings through treasury bills. This will assist \nnot only in developing a cash management framework for the Treasury as part of its fiscal policy \nbut  also  in  gauging  excess  liquidity  in  the  market,  which  supports  the  Royal  Monetary \nAuthority\u2019s monetary policy framework. The recent increase in the pricing of treasury bills, in \nreaction to the rapid decline of Indian rupee reserves, underscores the importance of moving \ntoward a market-based treasury bills system. \n \n10.  Capacity constraints exist across various areas at subnational levels, including financial \nmanagement  and  accountancy.  While  financial  officers  hold  an  undergraduate  degree  in \nfinancial management or accountancy, financial clerks are usually high school graduates with \nlimited financial management skills. Capacity development therefore requires a two-tier strategy, \nincluding (i) specialized and advanced training for financial officers through partnerships with \nreputable training institutes, and (ii) core training in auditing and accounting for financial clerks \nat the Royal Institute of Management.  \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Public Sector Resource Management. Manila (TA \n3513-BHU approved on 6 October) provided initial support in the setting up of the BAS. ", "3 \n \n11.  Finally,  the  August  2007  draft  constitution  requires  developing  a  system  of  fiscal \ntransfers from the Government to dzongkhags. Under the proposed system, approximately 20% \nof total revenue and grants are proposed to be assigned to the dzongkhags from the central \nbudget for district- and local-level spending. The transfers are to be assigned under various \ndevelopment schemes of which the block grants will constitute approximately 30% of total \ntransfers. The Planning Commission has identified a revenue-sharing formula for this block \ngrant scheme with defined weights for (i) population, (ii) food security, (iii) environment, and (iv) \ngeography. Monitoring the use of resources will be based on achieving targets including (i) \nincrease in income, (ii) poverty reduction, and (iii) health. The scheme\u2019s implementation and \nmanagement will require capacity development to enable local administrations to use resources. \nDeveloping operational links between the Planning Commission, Department of National Budget \n(DNB),  DPA,  RAA,  and  subnational  administrations\u2014and  with  systems  such  as  public \nprocurement management\u2014will be critical for integration under the BAS. \n \n12.  A key element of the Government\u2019s evolving role is RAA\u2019s expanded role. The new \nconstitution  envisages  RAA  to  be  independent  from  the  Royal  Civil  Service  Commission, \naffording  it  greater  autonomy.  Further,  RAA  will  also  be  separated  from  the  mainstream \nbudgetary channels and receive direct support from Parliament. The country\u2019s FYP outlay has \nincreased significantly over the last few plan periods. In this regard, RAA\u2019s strategic thrust has \nbeen  to  align  itself  to  its  stakeholders\u2019  needs,  including  (i)  parliamentary  public  account \ncommittees,  (ii) line  ministries,  (iii)  financial institutions,  and  (iv)  civil  society.  Stakeholders \nexpect RAA to provide (i) annual audit reports, (ii) agency audit reports, (iii) expert opinions, (iv) \naudit certificates, and (v) advisory services. \n \n13.  RAA\u2019s mandate has been expanded to include the following:  \n \n(i)  environmental auditing, including that in relation to waste, water, and biological \ndiversity;  \n(ii)  information  technology  (IT)  auditing  to  assess  information  and  cybernetic \nsystems with regard to efficiency and economy; \n(iii)  performance auditing, as an independent assessment and objective examination \nof organizations\u2019 financial and operational performance; and  \n(iv)  financial auditing to determine if financial statements are prepared in accordance \nwith identified frameworks.  \n \n14.  As part of its expanded role, RAA will evolve from conducting transaction audits to \nperformance audits. In a performance audit, RAA must now engage in reporting and advising \nParliament on managing public resources. RAA\u2019s advice will be integral to formulating policies \nand creating rules and regulations pertaining to public resources. RAA has already received TA \nsupport from the United Nations Development Program in which 35 officers were trained in \nperformance audits. Yet also under its expanded mandate, RAA is expected to increase the \nnumber of state-owned enterprises under its purview to beyond the current estimate of 200. \nRAA is also expected to independently evaluate statutory audits of state-owned firms that are \ncurrently undergoing statutory audits by foreign accounting firms. \n \n15.  RAA has identified its human resources (HR) as a weak link and has developed an HR \nstrategy to improve its capacity to functionalize this new operating modality. RAA is looking to \nADB to assist in further enhancing its HR capabilities as well as to upgrade and deploy auditing \n ", "4 \nsoftware. Functional elements, such as software support, will also be integrated in training \nprograms. Further, RAA has requested assistance in developing and implementing a public \ninformation and disclosure program on its evolving role.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The TA will support the Government\u2019s initiative to strengthen the institutional capacity of \npublic financial institutions thereby, improving their ability to fulfill their statutory mandates. The \nimpact of the TA is enhancement of budget, treasury, and audit management to support fiscal \nsustainability and financial management reporting as enumerated under the PFA and the Audit \nAct. The goal of the TA is to improve effectiveness of budget, treasury, and audit operations to \nsupport macroeconomic stability, which contributes to sustainable growth and poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n17.  The  TA  will  have  three  components:  (i)  strengthening  fiscal  management,  (ii) \nstrengthening Treasury management, and (iii) strengthening RAA. The TA will consist of three \nparts. Part 1 will conduct a detailed needs assessment of the TA\u2019s various subcomponents by \nworking closely with stakeholders and building on work undertaken by the Government. Part 2 \nwill design a road map to support the subcomponents\u2019 operational and training activities and \nbuild  on  the  needs  assessment\u2019s  findings.  Part  3  will  cover  the  road  map\u2019s  effective \nimplementation including delivery of solutions such as training and equipment installation. The \nTA supports the Government\u2019s efforts to build public financial management architecture based \non (i) the national budget as the Government\u2019s primary public policy instrument, (ii) developing \nsystems to monitor public flow of funds, (iii) developing checks and balances through audits of \npublic funds, and (iv) supporting a transparency and accountability framework. \n \n18.  The following components and subcomponents are to be supported under the TA: \n \n(i)  component 1: fiscal management   \n(a)  subcomponent 1: revising rules and regulations on budget management \n(b)  subcomponent 2: developing a multi-year rolling budget framework \n(c)  subcomponent 3: developing an intergovernmental fiscal transfer \nframework \n \n(ii)  component 2: Treasury management  \n(a)  subcomponent 4: consolidation of Treasury accounts \n(b)  subcomponent 5: strengthening financial management accounting and \nreporting \n(c)  subcomponent 6: developing cash management operations \n \n(iii)  component 3: RAA capacity building \n(a)  subcomponent 7: curriculum development for expanded RAA mandate \nincluding performance, environment, IT, and financial audits \n(b)  subcomponent 8: acquiring and implementing IT systems and auditing \nsoftware  for  improving  operational  efficiencies  within  RAA  and  for \nimproving in-house training ", "5 \n(c)  subcomponent 9: developing a sustainable RAA training and outreach \nprogram \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $860,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will provide $110,000 equivalent \nin local currency cost through counterpart staff, office facilities, and administrative support. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  MOF will serve as the Executing Agency. A senior MOF official will be appointed project \ndirector, the appointment of whom will be acceptable to ADB. MOF will be the Implementing \nAgency responsible for components 1 (through DNB) and 2 (through DPA). RAA will be the \nImplementing Agency for component 3. A steering committee, chaired by the deputy secretary \nof  finance,  will  be  established  with  representatives  of  RAA,  DPA,  DNB,  Royal  Institute  of \nManagement, Royal Monetary Authority, and Planning Commission; key chief financial officers; \ndeputy  chief  financial  officers  of  key  line  ministries;  and  dzongkhag  representatives.  The \ncommittee may invite other parties to attend its meetings when required. It will meet at least \nonce every quarter, and will be mandated to (i) monitor and guide TA implementation, (ii) \nresolve  issues  that  might  arise,  and  (iii)  review  consultants\u2019  reports.  ADB  will  attend  the \ncommittee meetings when possible. \n \n21.  Consulting services required under the TA include 11 person-months of international and \n46 person-months of national consultants, of which 40 person-months have been identified. Six \nperson-months will be used for short-term expertise on an as-needed basis, and international \nand national consultants will be mobilized intermittently over a 2-year period. A consulting firm \nwill be selected using the quality- and cost-based selection method, and based on a simplified \ntechnical proposal. The consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of reference for \nconsultants and proposed scheduling are in Appendix 3. \n \n22.  Equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). At the end of the TA, all equipment will be retained by user \nagencies. Procurement of network connections and software will be prioritized under the TA, \nand residual funds will be used for procurement of computers and printers.   \n \n23.  A training needs assessment will be undertaken at the beginning of the TA to improve \nthe budget process, which will lead to a training action plan. Training will be offered to staff of \nDNB,  DPA,  RAA,  Planning  Commission,  and  budget  officers  to  standardize  methods  and \nimprove coordination. It will also include training of dzongkhag- and gewog-level officials, such \nas budget and accounting officers, to develop a bottom-up approach to budget planning in view \nof reform introduction, such as block grant schemes.  \n \n24.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from January 2008 to January 2010. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bhutan for Strengthening Public Financial Management, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nEnhancement of public  Maintain the current operating  Semiannual budget report  \u2022  Scheduled \nfinancial institutions\u2019  deficit near zero    approval of \ncapacity, leading to    Year-end budget review  constitution \ngreater transparency  Fiscal policies consistent with    \u2022  Continuity in Tenth \nand accountability of  future taxes and supportive of  RAA annual report  Five-Year Plan \npublic accounts, more  macroeconomic stability    \u2022  Continued \neffective use of public    ADB consultant reports  commitment to \nspending, and ultimately  Meeting the sustainability of    reforms to public \nfiscal savings   fiscal balance does not  ADB evaluation missions  finance by incoming \ncompromise the development  Government \nbudget   \n  Risks \nImprovement in public spending   \noutcomes  \u2022  Difficulties in staffing \n  dzongkhags \nReductions in ways and means  (districts) and \nadvances to the Government  gewogs (local) \n \n\u2022  Coordination \nImprovement in systems, \nproblems between \npolicies, and procedures in \nPlanning \nconducting audits of state \nCommission and \ninstitutions \nMOF \n \n\u2022  Coordination \nExpanded capacity of RAA in \ndifficulties between \nundertaking variety of audit \nthe Government and \nfunctions \nministries and \nsubnational \nadministrations \n\u2022  Coordination \nproblems between \nRAA and line \ndepartments \n\u2022  Inability of line \ndepartments and \nstate-owned \nenterprises in \nappreciating \nexpanded audit role \nof RAA and audit \nrequirements \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nStronger budget,  Adherence to budget policy and  Budget statement  \u2022  Effectiveness of \ntreasury, and audit  fiscal framework statement    hired consultants \nmanagement in place to    Feedback from MOF and from line  \u2022  Regular ADB \nsupport fiscal  Reduction in time for line  ministries  reviews \nsustainability principles  ministries to present and agree    \u2022  Sufficient absorptive \nand financial  with MOF on spending  Feedback from civil society  capacity is in place \nmanagement reporting  commitments for new budget    from training \nrequirements as  year  Audit report  activities \nenumerated under the       \nnewly-approved PFA  Reduction in carryover of  ADB consultant reports  Risk \nspending agencies\u2019     \nundisbursed commitments from  ADB evaluation missions  \u2022  Ineffective resource \none year to the next    use, or inability to \n  Surveys conducted pre- and post- make use of \nImproved integration of current   formal training  resources, by \n   ", "Appendix 1  7 \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nand development budget  Annual staff performance reviews  agencies \n \nA minimum of 30 hours of \ntraining provided across each \nof the 3 components \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.
