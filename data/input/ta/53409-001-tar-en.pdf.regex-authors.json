INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) aims to support the South Asian \nAssociation  for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC)  and  its  eight  member  states  catalyze  and \nimplement policies and measures to increase regional cooperation and integration (RCI) and \nreinforce the growth momentum of the region.1 \n \n2.  The TA is consistent with and supportive of the Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority \n7: Fostering Regional Cooperation and Integration 2019\u20132024, and addresses the plan\u2019s three \nstrategic pillars: greater and higher quality connectivity between economies, expanded global and \nregional trade and investment opportunities, and increased and diversified regional public goods.2 \nThe TA is also aligned with the country programs as all SAARC member states have identified \nRCI as a key aspect to address national and regional development issues.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  SAARC is a regional organization comprising Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, \nMaldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. It was established in 1985 to improve the quality of life \nfor the people of South Asia through collective actions that would accelerate social progress and \neconomic growth. Since then, SAARC has made significant achievements in RCI.  \n \n4.  SAARC held 18 summits, 37 sessions of the SAARC Council of Ministers (of SAARC \nforeign ministers), and 42 sessions of the Standing Committee (of SAARC foreign secretaries). \nThese led to major agreements such as the Agreement on South Asian Free Trade Area and the \nSAARC Agreement on Trade in Services. These also led to a commitment to move toward a \nSouth  Asian  Economic  Union,  implementation  of  the  SAARC  visa  exemption  scheme, \nimprovement  in  transport  connectivity,  and  progress  on  energy  trade.  SAARC  signed \nmemorandums of understanding (MOUs) with 25 international organizations and 26 agreements \nand conventions for collaborative projects in various sectors. It also established some SAARC-\nspecialized bodies and regional centers that serve as \u201ccenters of excellence\u201d in specific fields. \nSAARC also created technical committees and working groups focused on specific areas of \ncooperation.  \n \n5.  While  SAARC  has  scored  some  successes  over  the  years,  challenges  impede  the \nrealization of RCI\u2019s full potential in the region, particularly the timely implementation of agreed \nRCI initiatives. South Asia remains one of Asia\u2019s less-integrated subregions. The region scored \n0.435 on the Asia-Pacific Regional Cooperation and Integration Index, which is below the average \nregional integration index score of 0.495.4  \n \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the website of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on \n18 February 2020. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 7: Fostering Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2019\u2013\n2024. Manila. \n3  Six member states of SAARC (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka)  are part of the South \nAsia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC), with the vision of boosting intraregional trade and cooperation in \nSouth Asia while also developing connectivity and trade with Southeast Asia. Afghanistan and Pakistan are members \nof the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC), which aims to promote development through \ncooperation, leading to accelerated growth and poverty reduction. \n4  The Asia-Pacific Regional Cooperation and Integration Index captures the contributions of six different aspects of \nregional integration: trade and investment, money and finance, regional value chains, infrastructure and connectivity, \nmovement of people, and institutional and social integration. \n \n ", "2 \n6.  Intraregional trade in 2018 accounted for about 6.3% of total trade while intraregional \nforeign direct investment was a meager 0.1% of the total foreign direct investment for SAARC \nmember states. This is in stark contrast to the figures for the same period for Southeast Asia, \nrecorded at 23.1% for total trade and 16.5% for intraregional foreign direct investment; East Asia,  \nat 35.5% and 46.4%; and Central Asia, at 7.6% and 2.9%.5 This is in large part because of the \nhigh cost of intra-SAARC trade\u2014it is more costly for SAARC countries to trade with their \nneighbors than with the European Union and the United States. The enormous potential of \nregional trade remains underexploited; gravity models show that total goods traded within the \nsubregion  could  be  worth  $67  billion,  compared  to  the  actual  trade  of  $23  billion.6 This \nunderscores the need to improve trade facilitation and infrastructure connectivity in the region. \nAccording to the Asia-Pacific Regional Cooperation and Integration Index, South Asia scores the \nlowest in infrastructure and connectivity among all the subregions in Asia. \n  \n7.  A study by United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific \nreveals that the low RCI in SAARC member states does not reflect poor complementarities among \nmember states but rather the absence of appropriate compliance with the agreed reforms. \nStrengthening the implementation of RCI initiatives could help unlock South Asia\u2019s growth \npotential. 7  Integration  can  be  improved  by  reducing  transport  costs,  improving  logistics \ninfrastructure, promoting trade in the service sector, substantially reducing barriers to trade, \npursuing monetary and financial integration, providing platforms for broader knowledge sharing, \nand enhancing collective actions on regional public goods including climate change.  \n \n8.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting SAARC in the following areas: \n(i) disseminating research and knowledge; (ii) building capacity and strengthening institutions; \nand (iii) facilitating regional policy dialogue.8 In 2004, ADB and the SAARC Secretariat signed an \nMOU to promote regional cooperation among the SAARC member states. Under the MOU, ADB \nand the SAARC Secretariat agreed to support member states\u2019 efforts to attain sustainable poverty \nreduction by promoting (i) programs and activities that will accelerate broad-based economic \ngrowth, social development, and good governance; and (ii) cross-border movements of goods, \nservices, and people through regional cooperation among the member states. They also agreed \nto promote programs and activities designed to establish institutional linkages between SAARC \nand  other  regional  cooperation  initiatives  such  as  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic \nCooperation (SASEC) and the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC). \n \n9.  In November 2019, the SAARC Secretariat requested ADB\u2019s continued financial and \ntechnical support to promote RCI in the region. The TA will build on the work completed and \nlessons learned from ADB\u2019s previous and ongoing support to SAARC. These include engendering \npolitical commitment from SAARC member states to ensure that the studies and dialogues will \n \n5  Regional integration indicators for Asia as cited in the ADB Asian Economic Integration Report 2019/2020.

SAARC  includes  resource-rich  member  states  and  some  of  the  fastest-growing \neconomies in ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department and South Asia Department, and \ncomplements other RCI programs including CAREC and SASEC, for which ADB serves as \nsecretariat. The TA will explore greater synergies with ADB\u2019s ongoing or planned operations for \nthe two subregional cooperation programs and will further strengthen cooperation with SAARC to \nmove forward the inter-subregional RCI agenda. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  RCI  among  SAARC  member  states \nincreased.9 The TA will have the following outcome: implementation of RCI initiatives in SAARC \nenhanced.10 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: Analytical studies on priority regional development issues produced. The \nanalytical studies will produce operationally relevant knowledge and identify regional projects that \ncould be included in the respective country\u2019s development plan and ADB\u2019s regional lending \npipelines. Topics that will be covered include transport connectivity, trade and investment, and \nother priority regional development issues. The transport study will focus on linking South Asia \nwith Central Asia by all modes of transport and will update the SAARC Regional Multimodal \nTransport Study.11 The study on trade and investment will seek to harmonize both the 8-digit tariff \nlines and customs tariffs in SAARC member states.12 Other analytical studies may also be \nconducted especially those relating to coronavirus disease pandemic and other issues that may \nbe requested by the SAARC Secretariat and member states. \n \n13.  Output 2: Capacity building, knowledge sharing, and policy dialogues organized. \nThe topics to be covered include: (i) climate change: ADB will review the implementation of the \nThimphu Statement on Climate Change, develop a road map for implementing the study on \nclimate risks in the SAARC region, and suggest ways forward based on the current status;13 (ii) \npoverty reduction: ADB will review the SAARC Plan of Action on Poverty Alleviation in light of the \n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development;14 (iii) regional economic integration: ADB will review \n \n9  Defined by the TA. \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n11 The SAARC Regional Multimodal Transport Study serves as the regional transport blueprint to improve regional \nconnectivity and facilitate the movement of goods and people among the SAARC member states. It is a key reference \nmaterial for SAARC member states to plan and develop their respective regional transport projects. \n12 All SAARC member states have different 8-digit tariff lines. An effort to harmonize these is yet to be made although \nupon recommendations of the Subgroup on Customs Cooperation, SAARC member states submitted all 8-digit \nharmonized system lines for harmonization. \n13 The study titled \u201cClimate Risks in the Region: Ways to Address the Social, Economic, and Environmental Challenges\u201d \nwas commissioned under the directive of the Thimphu Statement on Climate Change adopted by the SAARC \nmember states at the Sixteenth SAARC Summit in April 2010. Two TA projects supported the study: ADB. Promoting \nSouth Asian Regional Economic Cooperation II and ADB. Action on Climate Change in South Asia.  \n14 United Nations. Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.  \n \n ", "4 \nthe progress toward a South Asia Economic Union, particularly in the seven prioritized areas,15 \nand the implementation of the World Trade Organization Trade Facilitation Agreement; and (iv) \nregional financial cooperation: ADB will aim to enhance the effectiveness of the informal meeting \nof the SAARC finance ministers which is held on the sidelines of every ADB Annual Meeting. The \nTA team will organize some of these activities in collaboration with concerned ADB departments\u2014\ne.g., the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department, for activities relating to \nclimate  change\u2014and  in  collaboration  with  other  international  organizations  and  mutually \nrecognized partners. Other topics such as regional public health system may also be included \nupon discussion with SAARC. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which (i) $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6: $225,000 and TASF-other sources: \n$75,000) and (ii) $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Fund.16 The key expenditure items are provided in Appendix 2. A future increase in \nthe TA amount is highly likely as new analytical studies and knowledge sharing opportunities are \nexpected to be added given the current global health pandemic which affected various sectors of \nthe economies of SAARC member states. \n \n15.  These  fund  sources  will  finance  the  TA  activities  and  outputs  including  operational \nexpenses in the form of consulting services, training events, conferences, workshops, and other \nTA-related activities. The TA will not use the funds for civil works, procurement of large-scale \nequipment, or permanent staffing costs.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  through  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations \nCoordination Division of the South Asia Department in close consultation with the SAARC \nSecretariat and member states, as well as ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department, RCI \nThematic  Group,  and  other  relevant  units  and  departments.  ADB  will  engage  individual \nconsultants, procure goods, and organize workshops for the implementation of TA activities.  \n \n17.

Consulting services. ADB will engage individual international and national consultants \nfor the implementation of activities. These consultants will be engaged individually because (i) \nthey will operate in different countries, (ii) the timing of engagement will differ among countries, \n(iii) consultants will work and generate outputs independently, and (iv) consultant management \nwill be performed by staff of the Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division of \nthe South Asia Department. ADB will consider output-based (lump-sum) contracts for consulting \nservices, as appropriate. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or \nstaff instructions.17  \n \nIV.   THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis for \nStrengthening the Implementation of Regional Cooperation and Integration Initiatives of the South \nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n17 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked of documents in Appendix 3). \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nRegional cooperation and integration among SAARC member states increased (defined by TA). \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators  Reporting \nResults Chain  With Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2022:    Prolonged \nImplementation of RCI  At least 2 policy  Minutes of SAARC  decision-making \ninitiatives in SAARC  recommendations for  meetings  leads to delays in \nenhanced   improved RCI adopted for    the acceptance \nimplementation by SAARC    and adoption of \nSecretariat and member states     policy \n(2019 baseline: not applicable)    recommendations \nOutputs  By 2022:    Delay in \n1.
