During  the  2007  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  Philippines \nasked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide project preparatory technical assistance \n(PPTA) to prepare the Road Sector Improvement Project. During 2007 and 2008, ADB missions \nmet with the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH), the proposed Executing \nAgency,    to  discuss  the  PPTA  and  reach  an  agreement  on  its  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.1 The \nPPTA is included in ADB's Country Operations Business Plan (2007\u20132008) in the indicative \npipeline for nonlending products and services for 2008.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Road transportation is the dominant transport mode in the Philippines, accounting for \n53% of freight ton-kilometers and 89% of passenger ton-kilometers. The Philippines has a total \nroad network of about 200,000 kilometers (km), including about 29,000 km of national roads. \nAbout 70% of national roads are paved. National roads include 15,600 km of arterial roads and \n13,400 km of secondary roads. About 79% of the national arterial roads are paved, and 48% of \nthese require rehabilitation. In recent years, investment in transport has been well below that \nneeded to support maintenance and moderate improvement;2 this has hindered the country\u2019s \neconomic growth.  \n \n3.  Inter- and intra-island transport systems have a crucial role in supporting the economic \ndevelopment  of  the  widely  dispersed  regions  of  the  Philippine  archipelago.  However,  the \npresent inadequate condition of infrastructure facilities and lack of reliable, safe, and efficient \ntransport services significantly hampers the movement of passengers and cargo throughout the \ncountry, thus limiting direct internal and external trade links and tourism, and constituting a \nmajor constraint to increased regional economic growth. This is particularly true in many poor \nrural areas of the Philippines, where adequate accessibility could lower marketing costs for local \nagricultural products, improve access of the local population to social services and economic \nopportunities, and be the catalyst for investments to develop local resources. \n \n4.  A  major  issue  for  transport  is  inadequate  funding  for  maintenance  of  existing \ninfrastructure assets. The annual requirement for maintaining national roads is estimated at \nabout P16 billion.3 Financing for road maintenance has risen significantly since 2004, due to \nincreased revenues from road user charges; however, these are currently about one-third of \nestimated needs.4 Financing for national roads is provided from the general budget. While the \ncountry does have the Special Road Support Fund and designated revenues are deposited in \nthe fund, typically in recent budgets only about half of the deposited revenues have been \nappropriated for national roads. Underinvestment in road maintenance is estimated at about \n0.5% of gross domestic product. Official development assistance has accounted for about half \nof the financing for investment in national roads. DPWH is responsible for maintaining the \nnational road network. It has achieved some improvement of the road network by developing \nthe road information management support system, and establishing the Special Road Support \n                                                 \n1  The PPTA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities on 12 November 2007.  \n2  United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. 2005. While most developing countries \nin Asia have experienced significant growth in the length of road network in the last 20 years with the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan doubling road length, the Philippines has effectively stagnated. \n3  World Bank. 2005.

However, inefficient maintenance activities are a major constraint for \ndeveloping the national highway system. The World Bank has been assisting the Government to \nimprove financing of road infrastructure, including road maintenance, since 2000. The first \nphase of the National Roads Improvement and Management Program6 provided assistance for \ncreating  the  Special  Road  Support  Fund,  in  addition  to  financing  road  upgrading  and \nmaintenance. The recently approved second phase of the National Roads Improvement and \nManagement Program7 will provide further assistance in this area. The sector also suffers from \ninefficient resource utilization, which is being addressed by the Government and development \npartners. The World Bank, bilateral donors, and ADB have provided technical assistance for \npolicy and institutional reform. To achieve the objectives of the Medium-Term Infrastructure \nDevelopment Program (2005\u20132010), DPWH is working to institutionalize improved planning \nprocesses developed under the road information management support system. While some \nprogress has been made, particularly in developing systems for reforming internal processes in \nDPWH and institutions for road maintenance, additional work is necessary.  \n \n5.  The Government has a 10-point agenda for development, which for infrastructure covers \n(i) completing the nautical highways to transport the produce of Mindanao to Luzon and Visayas \nby paving and improving the remaining unimproved road sections of the western, central, and \neastern  nautical  highways;  (ii)  decongesting  Metro  Manila  by  developing  expressways; \n(iii) addressing critical transport bottlenecks in urban and rural areas; (iv) improving access to \nmajor tourist destinations; and (v) improving roads to support peace and development in Muslim \nMindanao and other conflict-affected or impoverished areas. The policies and strategies in the \nDPWH Medium-Term Infrastructure Development Program (2005\u20132010) include (i) formulating \nlong-range physical master plans by region, (ii) paving all national roads with concrete or \nasphalt with 95% of national roads paved by 2010, (iii) replacing deficient national bridges, and \n(iv)  prioritizing  roads  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  10-point  agenda.  Although  Government \nfinancing for improving road infrastructure has increased substantially in recent years (para. 4), \nexternal financing will continue to be necessary to realize the objectives of the Medium-Term \nInfrastructure Development Program. As a result of the trend of increasing revenues and plans \nto improve cost recovery, investment in the sector is expected to be sustainable. \n \n6.  The World Bank, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and ADB have \nprovided the largest amounts of external assistance to the road sector historically. The World \nBank  and  ADB  have  generally  focused  on  improvement  of  existing  roads,  either  through \nrehabilitation  or  through  carrying  out  periodic  maintenance,  while  JBIC  has  focused  on \nimprovement of existing roads and construction of new roads. The World Bank, ADB, and \nbilateral agencies have provided technical assistance for improvement of operations in the \nPhilippines  road  sector.  The  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  is \ncurrently providing transport sector capacity development assistance in the areas of (i) financial \nmanagement processes including internal controls and audits; (ii) organizational effectiveness \nincluding internal assessment and development of a reorganization plan for DPWH; (iii) road \npartnerships with nongovernment organizations; and (iv) integrity support including independent \nprocurement  assessment  and  advice  and  technical  audits.  The  World  Bank  will  provide \nassistance in road management service delivery and strategic sector reform under its recently \napproved project. In the area of road management service delivery, support will be provided for \na pilot trial of options for commercializing the current operations of district engineering offices to \n                                                 \n5  Although the road fund was established in 2001 with World Bank assistance and became fully operational in 2004, \nfurther improvement in operational efficiency is needed. \n6  World Bank. 2000.

To  further  strategic  sector  reform,  support  will  be  provided  to \nstrengthen the operations of the Road Board and update its mandate, review road cost recovery, \nand revisit options for restructuring the management and delivery of services in the sector. \n \n7.  ADB  assistance  to  the  Philippines  has  supported  all  transport  modes,  although \npredominantly the national and provincial road networks. The 2003 country assistance program \nevaluation for the Philippines8 found that the core problem of the road sector was the weakness \nof DPWH, particularly in maintaining and developing the national road network. The country \nassistance program evaluation highlights the need to conduct adequate preparatory studies, site \ninvestigations,  and  engineering  designs  prior  to  project  approval,  as  well  as  to  address \ninstitutional  weaknesses  of  the  executing  agency.  ADB\u2019s  most  recent  project  focusing  on \nnational roads was the sixth road project.9 Difficulties were encountered during implementation, \nparticularly regarding land acquisition and resettlement, which led to the absence of new ADB \nroad projects during the last decade. The difficulties were resolved, however, and the project \nwas  completed  in  2006.  The  project  completion  report 10  rated  it  as  \u201csuccessful\u201d  and \nrecommended advance action and external monitoring for land acquisition and resettlement \nactivities and further assistance for strengthening DPWH\u2019s institutional capacity. \n \n8.  A new ADB roadmap for the transport sector is being prepared, and the initial findings \nindicate that improvement is needed in the areas of (i) increasing funding for road maintenance, \nespecially for preventive maintenance; (ii) ensuring the sustainability of the road maintenance \nfunding mechanism; (iii) increasing investment in the upgrading and expansion of the national \nroad network to address the inadequate coverage of the network; and (iv) increasing the priority \nand financing given to road safety. Going forward, ADB\u2019s transport strategy for the Philippines \naims at promoting pro-poor economic growth and supports the Government\u2019s priority investment \nprogram, primarily in the road sector.11 This objective will be achieved by (i) addressing current \ndeficiencies  in  transport  network  maintenance,  (ii)  adopting  an  integrated  network-oriented \napproach for transport with emphasis on sustainability, (iii) removing critical bottlenecks in \ntransport infrastructure, (iv) addressing critical governance issues and institution building for \ntransport agencies, and (v) maximizing private sector involvement. Given the development \nneeds  and  gaps  for  transport,  the  current  policies,  initiatives,  and  ongoing  and  proposed \nactivities of other financing institutions, the focus of ADB\u2019s transport assistance will be on \nmaintaining and improving existing road network conditions. This will enable ADB to maximize \nthe benefits from previous ADB-financed projects to improve the national road network and \nsupports the strategic emphasis on roads.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the Project will be that transport on the national road network becomes \nmore efficient. The PPTA outcome is a design for a project, agreed upon by the Government \nand ADB, to improve national roads in the Philippines and to be financed through a multitranche \nfinancing  facility,  including  detailed  design  of  the  first  phase.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework for the Project is in Appendix 1. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2003.

The PP\u0422\u0410 will prepare a project to improve the national road network by carrying out \nperiodic  road  maintenance  and  rehabilitation  of  selected  national  roads  and  improving \ninstitutional capacity. The project is necessary to ensure that the Philippines\u2019 road network can \nsupport economic growth. The project will consist of three phases and be financed using ADB\u2019s \nmultitranche  financing  facility  in  three  tranches.  The  first  phase  will  involve  periodic  road \nmaintenance of selected national roads and design of the works to be undertaken during the \nsecond phase. The second and third phases will involve rehabilitation of selected national roads, \nperiodic road maintenance, and design of the works to be undertaken during the subsequent \nphases. DPWH has completed initial feasibility studies of roads throughout the Philippines and \nprepared a list of candidate projects for inclusion in the project. New projects, recently approved \nand  under  preparation  by  the  World  Bank  and  JBIC,  respectively,  will  also  focus  on \nmaintenance and improvement of national roads in the Philippines. However, given the large \nsize of the national road network and its needs for improvement, there will not be any overlap \nwith the proposed project. In recent years, investment in transport has been well below that \nneeded to support maintenance and moderate improvement. In addition, the major donors in the \ntransport sector hold regular meetings to coordinate activities and ensure that there is no \noverlapping.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  To prepare the project, the PPTA will (i) select project roads; (ii) prepare traffic forecasts \nfor the selected roads; (iii) prepare the preliminary design and cost estimates for the preferred \noption for meeting the traffic forecast; (iv) develop appropriate institutional arrangements for \nimplementing  the  project;  (v)  complete  an  economic  analysis  of  the  proposed  road \nimprovements  and  an  analysis  of  the  environmental  and  social  impacts  of  the  project, \nincluding resettlement effects and poverty analysis (the initial poverty and social analysis is in \nAppendix 2); and (vi) develop a program of institutional capacity building. The roads will be \nselected  based  on  maximum  economic  return  and  minimum  negative  environmental  and \nsocial impact, and will not overlap with road projects being implemented by other external \ndevelopment partners. The PPTA will examine the following areas for possible ADB assistance \nfor institutional capacity building, which are not being covered by other development partners: (i) \nquality  assurance  for  infrastructure  development;  (ii)  improvement  of  road  safety, \n(iii) development  of  institutional  capacity  to  address  right-of  way  management,  (iv) \nimplementation of revised postevaluation procedures, (v) development and installation of a \nproject  monitoring  and  information  system,  and  (vi)  improvement  of  human  resource \nmanagement systems.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $800,000 equivalent. The Government has \nasked ADB to provide $660,000 equivalent. The PPTA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the \nbalance  of  $140,000  equivalent  by  providing  required  office  accommodation  and  services, \nremuneration  and  per  diem  for  counterpart  staff,  and  other  items,  mostly  in  kind.  The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. The cost estimates and financing for the PPTA are given in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  DPWH will be the Executing Agency. It has the capacity to implement the PPTA \nsuccessfully given its prior experience with ADB projects. A DPWH undersecretary will be \n ", "  5\nresponsible for overall coordination of relevant departments and agencies; consultants; and \nADB,  including  extensive  consultations  with  stakeholders.  The  Government  will  set  up  a \nsteering committee to oversee and coordinate all PPTA activities. The steering committee \nwill  be  chaired  by  a  DPWH  undersecretary  and  comprise  representatives  from  the \nDepartment of Finance, DPWH, and National Economic and Development Authority. DPWH\u2019s \nproject implementation office for ADB projects will be responsible for PPTA implementation. \nThe Government will make a team of counterpart staff available to help the consultants carry \nout  the  PPTA  in  a  timely  manner.  DPWH  will  provide  office  accommodation,  local \ncommunication facilities, office support staff, and other administrative support. \n \n14.  An international consulting firm in association with national consultants will be selected \nand engaged by ADB, using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost \nweighting of 80:20. ADB will apply its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time) in engaging consultants. The simplified technical proposal procedure will be \nused to select the consultants. Advance action for recruitment of consultants was approved on 3 \nOctober 2007. A total of about 11 person-months of international and 42 person-months of \nnational consulting services will be required. The consultants will have extensive experience in (i) \ntransport planning, including related financial management; (ii) economic evaluation of road \nprojects; (iii) transport policy institutional arrangements; and (iv) environmental, social, and \npoverty impact assessments, including resettlement. To facilitate the work and ensure that \nDPWH gains technical expertise and knowledge, the consultant team will work closely with \ncounterpart technical experts from DPWH, who will assist with the necessary surveys and other \nwork. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n15.  The  PPTA  will  be  implemented  over  about  8  months,  beginning  in  July  2008  for \ncompletion by March 2009. The consultants will submit (i) an inception report within 1 month of \ncommencing their services; (ii) an interim report within 3 months; (iii) a draft final report within 6 \nmonths  including  the  environmental,  social,  and  poverty  impact  assessment  reports  and \nresettlement framework; and (iv) a final report within 3 weeks after receipt of comments from the \nGovernment and ADB. DPWH, ADB, and the consultants will meet in Manila to review and \nendorse the inception, interim, and draft final reports. The consultants will conduct seminars for \nDPWH  staff  and  any  other  interested  government  organizations  concerning  the  PPTA \ntechniques, analysis, and findings. Equipment to be provided under the PPTA will be procured \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Office \nequipment purchased will be transferred to DPWH upon completion of the PPTA, and thereafter \nwill remain the property of the Government.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $660,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Philippines for Preparing the Road Sector Improvement Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nTransport on the  \u2022 Traffic increases on  \u2022 Government statistics  \u2022 Economic growth in project \nnational road network  project roads  \u2022 Department of Public  area continues at recent \nbecomes more efficient  \u2022 Vehicle operating  Works and Highways  levels \n  costs on project roads  traffic statistics   \ndecrease     \nOutcome      Assumption \n\u2022 Design for overall  \u2022 Memorandum of  \u2022 Memorandum of  \u2022 The Government obtains \nproject and feasibility  understanding signed  understanding  required counterpart \nstudy for tranche 1  with the Government     funding \nagreed upon by the     \nAsian Development     \nBank (ADB) and \nGovernment \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis describe how \nthe project would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction \nstrategy of the partner country.   \n \nThe project will lower the cost of transport thus contributing to poverty reduction by lowering marketing costs for \nlocal agricultural products, improving access of the local population to social services and economic opportunities, \nand serving as a catalyst for investments to develop local resources. \n \nB.  Targeting Classification          \n1. Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, \netc.) \n \n2. Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nThe project will rehabilitate national roads, which will impact the national economy in terms of transportation of \ngoods, trade, etc. \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1. If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \n2. What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence? International \nand national consulting services are allocated in the PPTA for poverty analysis. \n \n3. If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross-subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? Road maintenance during the first tranche and rehabilitation work in the second \nand third tranches could provide opportunities for recruitment of local labor. The PPTA will explore opportunities for \nlocal labor recruitment and number of days of employment that could be generated through road maintenance and \nrehabilitation work. The tourism industry can expand in the regions due to improved roads, and can increase \ndemand for goods and services from the poor. The impact of improved roads and increased access to social \nservices on the poor will be examined under the PPTA.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1. Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from \nthe project? Vehicle operators, road users, and traders are the potential primary beneficiaries. The poor will benefit \nfrom construction work, roadside vending, and savings in transport time and cost.  \n \n2. What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? The beneficiaries need access to \nadequate transport to employment opportunities, markets, social services, etc. The improved roads will reduce \ntravel time and cost of vehicle operation, and improve road safety access to markets and social services.  \n \n3. What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? Existing roads will be improved under the project. No constraints in accessing the benefits and services are \nanticipated.    \n \n \n \n \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nB.   Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. The project stakeholders include relevant government agencies, vehicle \noperators, road users, and people living near the project roads. \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., \nworkshops,  community  mobilization,  involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  and  community-based \norganizations,  etc.)?  Consultation  through  workshops  and  involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  and \ncommunity-based organizations will be done with stakeholders during the PPTA. \n \n3. What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n    Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \nThe project includes road maintenance and rehabilitation, and therefore little opportunity is available for various \nstakeholders to provide input into the design. The PPTA consultant will conduct consultation with the stakeholders \nto assess the impact of the improved road on access to markets and social services, travel time, transport cost, and \nopportunities for local labor recruitment and small-scale trading along the road.  \n \n4. Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain. Consultation will be done with stakeholders \nduring the PPTA. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \n \nThe key gender issues in the road sector are related to increased mobility of men and women, employment \nopportunities, and market access outside the local community for women. The PPTA consultants will examine the \npresent mobility of men and women living along the road, labor market opportunities, and access to trade and \nservices by men and women; and will assess the potential impact of improvement of roads on men and women.  \n \n2. Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment \nby improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?   Yes     No Please explain. Improved roads will increase access to social services by women in terms \nof better access to higher education and access to medical facilities for women from rural areas; and have a positive \nimpact on women\u2019s physical mobility, education, employment, health, and business opportunities.  \n \n3.
