THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based grant, and (ii) a proposed project grant to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Health \nSector Development Program. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for \nCapacity Development of the Health Sector, and if the Board approves the proposed grants, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The sector development program (SDP) will support government efforts to improve the \nequity, efficiency, and sustainability of Bhutan\u2019s health system, and to promote good health and \nwell-being of its citizens  towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The SDP \ncomprises (i) a project financed by a project grant, under which the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) will invest in primary health care (PHC) improvements; and (ii) a program financed by a \npolicy-based grant, under which ADB will support governance and institutional improvements in \nhealth financing and health information management. The SDP will also advance Bhutan\u2019s health \nsecurity agenda through strategic support for the prevention and control of infectious diseases in \nline with Bhutan\u2019s commitment to the International Health Regulations (2005).1 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Bhutan has made great strides in economic development. Its per capita gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) increased nearly fourfold from $774 in 2000 to $2,900 in 2017.2 The government \nrecognizes health as a critical domain of Bhutan\u2019s core development philosophy: gross national \nhappiness. Health services are constitutionally guaranteed, and the government provides a \ncomprehensive range of free health services to all citizens. Since the early 1990s, the country \nhas made significant investments to develop its health system from a low base and achieved \nremarkable progress in health outcomes. Average health indicators vastly improved from being \namong the poorest in the world to mostly achieving the Millennium Development Goals. 3 Life \nexpectancy at birth improved from 43.0 years in 1985 to 70.2 years in 2017.4 Child immunization \ncoverage  has  been  sustained  at  more  than  95%  since  2010.5 Household  out-of-pocket \nexpenditure is relatively low, implying a fair level of equity and financial protection (footnote 5). \nHealth facility coverage is also extensive\u201495% of the population live within a 3-hour walk from a \nhealth facility, which is a considerable feat given Bhutan\u2019s difficult terrain.6 \n \n4.  Development problem. Despite these impressive gains, Bhutan still faces considerable \nchallenges to further improve the equity, efficiency, and financial sustainability of the health care \nsystem. Sustaining the delivery of free health services is a key challenge as health care costs \ncontinue to rise from a heavier burden of noncommunicable diseases, growing expectations of \nthe population, and medical-technological advancements. At the same time, in view of Bhutan\u2019s \neconomic progress, donors have increasingly withdrawn from the country, reducing the amount \n                                                \n1  World Health Organization (WHO). 2005. International Health Regulations (2005). Geneva. \n2  International Monetary Fund. DataMapper. http://www.imf.org/external/Datamapper/ (accessed 25 June 2018). \n3  The maternal mortality ratio fell from 777 per 100,000 live births in 1984 to 86 per 100,000 live births in 2012. The \ninfant mortality rate dropped from 102 per 1,000 live births in 1984 to 30 per 1,000 live births in 2012. Government \nof Bhutan, Ministry of Health (MOH). 2012. National Health Survey, 2012.

Thimphu. \n ", "2 \nof external grants that traditionally played a significant role in the health system.7 These cost \npressures make it imperative to review the efficiency of current health service delivery. The health \nsystem also needs to overcome the persistent regional disparities in health outcomes.8 Rapid \nurbanization has led to new gaps in service coverage, leaving a growing urban migrant base \nunderserved. Moreover, the risks of infectious diseases and to health security have increased \nbecause of growing cross-border travel and economic activities. \n \n5.  Binding constraints. To address the challenges, the government aims to strengthen \nPHC as the core of its health system. Inadequate PHC services, insufficient health financing, and \nfragmented health information management are among the key constraints. The government \nneeds to improve its PHC facilities, especially in peripheral areas, to bridge regional disparities in \naccess to health care. It needs to explore alternative funding mechanisms to finance critical PHC \nservices, and it needs to strengthen the health information system (HIS) to facilitate patient \nreferrals and coordinate the continuum of care between PHC and higher-level hospitals. There is \nalso potential for improving the overall efficiency of health sector management and the disease \nsurveillance system by streamlining fragmented health information management. \n \n6.  Inadequate  primary  health  care.  The  disproportionate  focus  on  hospital  care  and \nunderinvestment in PHC are a key source of cost inefficiency in Bhutan. In 2016, only 10% of \ncurrent health expenditure (CHE) was at PHC facilities, compared with 63% of CHE at secondary \nand tertiary hospitals. Spending on preventive services is also low at 7% of CHE, compared with \n74% of CHE for curative care.9 Limited PHC services and the lack of a formal referral mechanism \nare prompting the population, especially in urban centers, to bypass PHC and overuse costly \nhospital  care,  which  reduces  the  overall  cost-effectiveness  of  the  health  delivery  system. \nFurthermore, underfunded PHC facilities disproportionately affect the health access of those in \nrural areas and lower income groups, given the stark disparities observed in physical health \naccess. For example, the average time to reach the nearest health facility ranges from 120 \nminutes for the poorest groups to 15 minutes for the richest groups, and from 75 minutes in rural \nareas to 18 minutes in urban areas (footnote 5). Proximity is the most common reason for visiting \na health facility, and the utilization of PHC facilities is concentrated among rural residents and \nlower-income groups. However, many PHC facilities lack adequate facilities such as toilets, \nrunning water, and basic health equipment. Women of childbearing age and young children may \nbe the most affected by the disparities in health access; in fact, sharp inequities are observed \nespecially in the indicators of institutional delivery and child mortality.10 \n \n7.  Insufficient health financing. The government is the predominant source of health \nfinancing in Bhutan, but the health sector has received a proportionally lower share of general \ngovernment  expenditure  over  recent  years.  During  2010\u20132014,  general  government  health \nexpenditure dropped from 5% to 3% of GDP, and from 11% to 8% of general government \nexpenditure.11 This decline has been driven by a shift in the government\u2019s investment priority to \nrevenue-generating infrastructure projects. The outlook for Bhutan\u2019s economy is generally sound, \nbut there are downside risks to macroeconomic stability from the high public-sector debt (109% \n                                                \n7  Footnote 5. The share of external resources as a percentage of total health expenditure dropped from 28% in 1996 \nto 6% in 2015. \n8  For example, the child mortality rate is 81 per 1,000 live births in rural areas and 41 per 1,000 live births in urban \nareas, and deliveries by skilled birth attendants are at 90% in urban areas and 54% in rural areas.

Global Health Expenditure Database. http://apps.who.int/nha/database (accessed 25 June 2018). \n ", "3 \nof GDP).12 Given the macroeconomic risk, sector budgetary allocations and financing for essential \nPHC services may fluctuate. In this context, the need to strengthen the Bhutan Health Trust Fund \n(BHTF)\u2014the sole financing facility with the mandate to sustain PHC services primarily through \npredictable financing of vaccines and essential drugs\u2014is increasingly critical. In 2014, the BHTF \ncontributed 5.14% to total health expenditure, and this share is expected to increase further as \ndonors  reduce  support  for  vaccine  procurement  in  the  country.13 However,  the  BHTF\u2019s \nsustainability is at risk because of insufficient capital to meet rising demand, a weak investment \nstrategy, and limited operational capacity (footnote 13). Moreover, the equity of health financing \nin Bhutan needs to be given more policy emphasis, because the distribution of benefits from public \nhealth financing is only marginally pro-poor and skewed to the wealthier groups.14 \n \n8.  Fragmented health information management. The management and governance of \nhealth information in Bhutan is highly fragmented.15 A range of information systems, managed by \ndifferent departments of the Ministry of Health (MOH), were independently developed over the \nyears with wide variations in technology and data standards. The lack of a common interface and \ninteroperability among the different systems prevent data sharing and optimal data analysis to \nguide key sector decisions, including analysis of gender differentials in health trends. Myriad \nisolated systems also create a large and often redundant reporting burden on health facilities, \nthereby reducing the quality and regularity of reporting to the critical national disease surveillance \nsystem. The lack of a good patient information system further makes it difficult to track and refer \npatients and coordinate the continuum of care between PHC and higher-level hospitals. To \nimprove overall sector efficiency and reduce duplications in service delivery, the government\u2019s \nvision is to have digital, longitudinal patient information that can be accessed across all health \nfacilities and to shift to a streamlined, interoperable national HIS. \n \n9.  Government\u2019s sector strategy and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy. The National \nHealth Policy (NHP) promotes achieving self-reliance and sustainability through efficiency in \nhealth service delivery and the realization of universal health coverage on the principles of PHC.16 \nThe draft 12th 5-year plan for 2018\u20132023 supports the medium-term implementation of the NHP \nthrough appropriate program and budgetary commitments.17  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n2014\u20132018 for Bhutan aligns with government priorities to achieve self-reliance and inclusive \nsocial development, including improved health outcomes.18 \n \n10.  Value  added  by  ADB  assistance  and  lessons  learned.  During  2000\u20132002,  ADB \nprovided a policy-based loan for the Bhutan Health Care Reform Program to support health sector \nreforms in key priority areas, including sustainable health financing and strengthened PHC.19 The \nreform program helped establish the BHTF through the Royal Charter in 2000. The proposed SDP \nbuilds  on  the  added  value  and  experience  of  previous  ADB  support  to  the  sector.  It  will \nreinvigorate and deepen health reforms in support of PHC to meet the sector\u2019s evolving needs \namid Bhutan\u2019s changing economic, demographic, and epidemiological contexts. The SDP design \nincorporates key lessons from the reform program, as well as findings from detailed technical due \ndiligence.20 Strong government ownership, deepening of ongoing government reform initiatives, \n                                                \n12 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 BHTF.

As Bhutan makes good socioeconomic progress, overall \nexternal assistance to the country has declined drastically (footnote 7). Apart from United Nations \nagencies, major health sector donors are the Government of India; the Japan International \nCooperation Agency; the Japan Children\u2019s Vaccine Initiative; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; and the \nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.22 The sector is facing new challenges that \nwill  require  incremental  reforms.  Future  sector  development  will  thus  require  Bhutan  to \nstrategically harness more external resources to help make the necessary adjustments. ADB\u2019s \nrenewed health assistance is therefore timely, and ADB\u2019s partnership with the government in this \nsector is expected to continue well  beyond the program period. ADB has coordinated the \nassessment  and  design  of  this  SDP  with  relevant  development  partners,  including  the \nInternational Monetary Fund. \n \n12.  The  SDP  is  the  most  appropriate  modality  since  the  sector  requires  both  project \ninvestment and policy reforms to form an integrated response to the need for greater sustainability \nof health service delivery in Bhutan. The project grant will support removing PHC supply- and \ndemand-side barriers, especially in underserved areas. The policy reforms will reinforce the \nproject investment and strengthen the PHC system by supporting (i) sustainable financing of key \nPHC commodities through the BHTF and (ii) a more efficient HIS to underpin the management of \nPHC delivery and its coordination with higher-level hospital care. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n13.  The SDP is aligned with the following impacts: national health goals achieved, and self-\nreliance and sustainability in Bhutan\u2019s health service delivery achieved (footnote 16). The SDP \nwill have the following outcome: equitable access, efficiency, and financial sustainability of the \nhealth system improved.23 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  The SDP will have three outputs. The project grant will support output 1 for PHC service \ndelivery improvements in selected areas. The policy-based grant will support outputs 2 and 3 for \nenhanced health financing and health information management. 24 In line with ADB\u2019s backing for \nthe regional health security agenda, the SDP also integrates assistance for strengthening disease \nsurveillance,  financing  vaccines  through  the  BHTF,  and  improving  provisions  for  infection \nprevention and control at primary health facilities.25 \n \n15.  Output 1: Primary health services, especially in underserved areas, improved. This \nproject-based  output  will  support  improvements  in  PHC  service  delivery,  especially  in \nunderserved areas.26 The emphasis on PHC will help bridge regional health disparities and \n                                                \n21 ADB. 2006.

All first-tranche conditions have been met. \n25 ADB\u2019s support aligns with the recommendations of the Joint External Evaluation of International Health Regulations \n(2005) for Bhutan (Government of Bhutan and WHO. 2017. Joint External Evaluation of International Health \nRegulations (2005) for the Kingdom of Bhutan, December 2017. Thimphu). \n26 Based on poverty levels, urban peripheries of Phuentsholing and Thimphu, and eight rural districts (Dagana, Mongar, \nPemagatshel, Samdrup Jongkhar, Trashigang, Trashi-Yangtse, Trongsa, and Zhemgang) are prioritized. \n ", "5 \nimprove  the  cost-effectiveness  of  the  overall  health  delivery  system.  Investments  involve \n(i) constructing five PHC satellite clinics in urban peripheries; (ii) upgrading existing PHC facilities \nwith better infrastructure for infection control and waste management; (iii) providing medical \nequipment for enhanced PHC service delivery, including immunization and transportation of \nlaboratory samples; (iv) providing capacity development to roll out the Bhutan Health Standards \nand Quality Assurance mechanism at PHC facilities; and (v) supporting PHC advocacy and \nbehavioral change communication through civil society organizations. \n \n16.  Output 2: Support for health sector financing enhanced. This policy-based output will \nhelp achieve equitable health financing and a sustainable BHTF, whose core mandate is to \nsupport PHC primarily by financing vaccines and essential medicines. The policy actions include \nmeasures to (i) bolster BHTF\u2019s operations by strengthening its capital base, capacity, and \ngovernance; (ii) make the distribution of public health financing benefits more equitable through \na benefit-incidence analysis; and (iii) institute the legal basis through a  health bill for governing \nhealth financing equity, efficiency, and sustainability.27 ADB\u2019s budget support under this output \nwill help the BHTF in mobilizing capital and diversifying its investments offshore.28 \n \n17.  Output  3:  Disease  surveillance  and  HIS  enhanced. This  policy-based  output  will \nimprove  the  management  and  governance  of  Bhutan\u2019s  HIS  to  support  PHC  and  patient \nmanagement, disease surveillance for increased health security, and overall sector management \nefficiency. The output will facilitate Bhutan\u2019s incremental move from the currently fragmented \nindividual systems to an interoperable national HIS. Policy actions include (i) development and \nadoption of a national e-health strategy, (ii) creation of an HIS governing body, (iii) development \nand adoption of an HIS enterprise architecture for interoperability, and (iv) development and \nadoption of technical standards for health data exchange. The implementation of the e-health \nstrategy and interoperable HIS is reflected in the draft 12th 5-year plan (footnote 17). ADB\u2019s \nbudget support under this output is expected to contribute to government spending on strategy \nand governance; information technology infrastructure, services, and applications; data standards \nfor interoperability; and workforce capacity development. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n18.  The SDP is estimated to cost $41.22 million (summary of cost estimates in Table 1 and \nsummary of financing plan in Table 2). Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by \nfinancier for the project grant (output 1) are in the project administration manual (PAM).29 \n                                                \n27 Legal provisions are needed, including for collecting health care contributions, protecting patient rights, and \nregulating health data exchange and data privacy. \n28 The BHTF needs to diversify its investment beyond wholly domestic assets, but current central bank regulations \nrestrict currency conversion and transfer. ADB\u2019s budget support for the BHTF will be in United States dollars and \nreleased to an offshore account to catalyze the BHTF\u2019s offshore investing and to enhance its investment return. \n29 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

As regards the BHTF\u2019s sustainability (output 2), the financing need for augmenting the \ncapital base was estimated to be $20 million to avert an expected BHTF revenue deficit from 2021 \ndue to the (i) projected rise in expenditures for vaccines and essential drugs, (ii) increased cost \nto the BHTF to cover its own operations under its autonomous status,30 and (iii) expected decline \nin revenue from a fall in the inflation-adjusted return of the BHTF\u2019s domestic investment portfolio \n(footnote 13). To cover the estimated financing gap, the government requested a grant of $10 \nmillion from ADB, and the government will provide Nu500 million to the BHTF. The BHTF is also \nexpected to mobilize additional funds to bridge the remaining funding gap and to optimize its \nrevenue through diversified investing.31 For the HIS program under output 3, the government \n                                                \n30 With its new autonomous status, the BHTF will have to cover its own operational costs from earned revenue. In the \npast, the general government budget covered the BHTF\u2019s overhead costs. \n31 The BHTF will mobilize funds in annual fundraising events such as lotteries and health walks; and from private \nindividuals, companies, and foundations. \n ", "7 \nestimated an overall requirement of $17 million over the medium term.32 Of this, ADB will provide \na grant of $4 million to help finance the program, and the government is expected to fund the rest \nunder the 12th 5-year plan budget for flagship programs.33 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and detailed in the PAM \n(footnote 29). \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  September 2018\u2013August 2023 \nEstimated completion date  31 August 2023 \nEstimated closing date   28 February 2024 \nProject management \n(i)  Oversight body  The project steering committee chaired by MOH\u2019s secretary will be the oversight body. \nDistrict management committees will monitor activities in the eight focus districts. \n(ii)  Executing agency  MOH \n(iii) Implementing units  BHTF; DMSHI, DPH, PPD, ICT Division, and QASD of MOH \n(iv) Management and  The project management and policy support unit will be established in MOH to \ncoordination  coordinate and manage the overall sector development program. \nProcurementa  Procurement from  1 contract through WHO (vehicles)  $322,030 \n  specialized agencies  2 contracts through UNICEF (goods)  $293,540 \n(international advertising) \n  Open competitive bidding  8 contracts (works)  $1,822,260 \n(national advertising)  12 contracts (goods)  $1,907,090 \n  Request for quotations   3 contracts (equipment and furniture)  $84,830 \nConsulting servicesa  Consultants\u2019 qualification  2 contracts  $225,720 \nselection \n  Individual consultant  14 person-months (international)  $204,260 \nselection  232 person-months (national)  $158,270 \nRetroactive financing and/or  Retroactive financing will cover up to 20% of the ADB project grant for eligible \nadvance contracting  expenditures incurred prior to grant effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months prior \nto the signing of the project grant agreement. \nDisbursement  The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nbetween the Government of Bhutan and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BHTF = Bhutan Health Trust Fund, DMSHI = Department of Medical Supplies and \nHealth Infrastructure, DPH = Department of Public Health, ICT = information communication technology, MOH = Ministry \nof Health, PPD = Policy and Planning Division, QASD = Quality Assurance and Standardization Division, UNICEF = \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund, WHO = World Health Organization. \na  Procurement (including consulting services) will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n22.  The proposed TA for Capacity Development of the Health Sector will support program \nimplementation. It will have two outputs to support the government in (i) bolstering health sector \nfinancing and the BHTF\u2019s institutional development, and (ii) strengthening the HIS and digital \nhealth governance. The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The government will provide \n                                                \n32 A breakdown of the estimated program cost by component is in the Assessment of Health Information Systems \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The WHO will also provide technical support to the MOH \nfor implementing the e-health strategy and digital HIS. \n33 The government introduced flagship programs as an innovation with a tentative allocation of Nu15 billion under the \n12th 5-year plan. Funding under flagship programs is in addition to the line agency\u2019s allocated plan budget. \n ", "8 \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, workshop venues, and other in-\nkind contributions. The MOH will be the executing agency for the TA, which will be implemented \nover 2 years during the SDP implementation.34 \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  Overall, the project (output 1) is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal \nrate of return of 16%. The major economic benefits of the project accrue to project beneficiaries \nin the form of (i) their improved productivity (estimated using disability-adjusted life years saved) \nand (ii) out-of-pocket health cost savings from better PHC services. The economic costs are (i) the \ncost of the project investment during the 5-year implementation period and (ii) operation and \nmaintenance costs. Budget adequacy and financial sustainability of the project investments were \nconfirmed based on (i) the country\u2019s medium-term budgetary framework and budget allocation; \nand  (ii)  government  financial  capacity  and  commitment  to  sustain  project  infrastructure, \nequipment, and maintenance of capital investments.35 \n \nB.  Governance \n \n24.  The financial management risk is moderate mainly because the MOH has well-established \nsystems  for  financial  management,  including  computerized  budgeting  and  expenditure \nmanagement  systems,  but  its  (i)  accounting  staff  has  limited  experience  and  capacity  to \nimplement ADB projects and (ii) internal auditing is inadequate. To mitigate these risks, the MOH \nagreed to an action plan to strengthen its financial management capacity, including (i) assigning \ndedicated accountants in the project management and policy support unit who will be trained on \nADB procedures and (ii) increasing the scope and quality of the MOH\u2019s internal audits. The MOH \nwill also engage a financial management expert to provide capacity building support to the project \naccounting staff. With the proposed risk mitigating measures, the MOH\u2019s financial management \ncapacity for the project is expected to be satisfactory. ADB\u2019s procurement capacity and risk \nassessments further showed that the MOH can handle the procurement of works, goods, and \nservices for the project by establishing the project management and policy support unit and \nthrough additional support from a procurement expert. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MOH. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n25.  Poverty continues to be a largely rural phenomenon in Bhutan\u2014the poverty rate is 11.9% \nin rural and 0.8% in urban areas.36 While Bhutan has achieved remarkable progress in key health \noutcomes, rural\u2013urban disparities in the health status remain. Differences also show in the use of \nhealth services by wealth profile, in that richer people use hospitals more than the poor.37 As \nBhutan experiences rapid urbanization, attention needs to be paid to meeting the health needs of \nthe growing urban migrant population. The SDP will contribute to government efforts to reduce \npoverty and disparities through (i) investments to strengthen PHC services in both rural and urban \nperipheries to meet the needs of the poor and underserved, and (ii) support for immunization, \n                                                \n34 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 Government of Bhutan, National Statistics Bureau. 2017.

The SDP is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. The MOH developed a gender \naction  plan  (GAP)  with  clear  targets,  responsibilities,  and  resource  allocation.38 It  will  be \nimplemented by the MOH and closely monitored by the MOH\u2019s gender focal person. Data on the \nprogress of the GAP indicators will also be collected and monitored through the Gender Equality \nMonitoring System of the National Commission for Women and Children. The ADB gender \nconsultant  based  at  the  Bhutan  Resident  Mission  will  also  support  GAP  monitoring  and \nimplementation. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n27.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.39 \n \n28.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination with an environmental \nmanagement plan and an environmental assessment and review framework has been prepared.40 \nThe construction or upgrade of facilities is not expected to have significant or irreversible negative \nenvironmental impacts during construction or operation. Construction impacts will be site-specific \nand  typical  of  small-scale  construction  projects  and  mitigated  through  the  environmental \nmanagement plan\u2019s implementation. Medical waste management during the operation of facilities \nwill follow applicable national laws, and relevant provisions are incorporated in the project design. \nIn the absence of appropriate national laws and regulations, international good practices in the \nWorld Bank\u2019s Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines will be followed.41 Each municipality \nor district will prepare a medical waste management plan, and the MOH will train health staff on \nhealth care waste management and infection prevention and control measures. The MOH will \nfurther recruit an environment expert to assist with safeguard implementation, monitoring, and \nreporting  requirements.  For  the  policy-based  grant,  no  significant  environmental  impact  is \nanticipated. \n \n29.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category C). The project will not \ninvolve any land acquisition. New construction will be limited to five small urban clinics on vacant \ngovernment land with no productive use. No physical or economic displacement will occur. No \nindigenous peoples live in the project areas. The policy-based grant is also not anticipated to have \nsocial safeguard impacts. \n \nE.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n30.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.42 In addition, following the national \nelections during September\u2013October 2018, there may be some risk of change in government \ncommitment to fully implement the reforms supported by the SDP. However, this risk is low due \nto wide support for the program by a broad range of stakeholders and its close alignment with the \ndraft 12th 5-year plan. The MOH will also proactively advocate with the new government for full \n                                                \n38 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 ADB.
