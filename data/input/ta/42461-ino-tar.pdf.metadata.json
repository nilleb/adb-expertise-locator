The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  supported  social  security  reform  and \npreparation of the National Social Security System (SJSN) law in Indonesia through technical \nassistance (TA) and program support.1 Currently, ADB is providing assistance to develop a draft \nwhite paper on the design of the social security system. The Government of Indonesia (the \nGovernment) has asked ADB to provide additional advisory TA to finalize the design of the \nsystem,  including  the  contribution  and  benefit  structure;  and  support  key  implementation \naspects. Given the fiscal challenges facing the Government, fiscal implications of various social \nsecurity schemes need to be assessed. In addition, the Government is enhancing its capacity to \nanticipate a range of shocks that could have significant poverty, macroeconomic, and fiscal \nimplications. The Government has requested assistance to strengthen capacity in these areas.  \n \n2.  The  TA2 was  initially  listed  in  the  nonlending  products  and  services  of  the  country \nstrategy program3 and country operations business plan for 2009.4 It is brought forward to be \nprocessed in 2008 to accommodate the Government\u2019s request. ADB fielded the Fact-Finding \nMission  in  August  2008  and  reached  detailed  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the \nobjectives and scope of the TA, the terms of reference for consultants, and the cost and \nimplementation arrangements. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Government, through its medium-term development plan for 2005\u20132009, aims to \nreduce poverty significantly in 2009; and is dedicated to achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals by 2015. Improved economic growth together with increased support for the poor reduced \npoverty to about 17% of population in 2007, equivalent to the poverty level before the financial \ncrisis.5 Despite  this  encouraging  success,  persistent  efforts  are  required  to  ensure  that \neconomic  growth  benefits  the  poor  segment  of  the  population.  In  2007,  about  37  million \nIndonesians were living below the poverty line; these figures are exacerbated by the fact that \nmany  nonpoor  are  clustered  around  the  poverty  line.  This  makes  a  large  number  of  the \npopulation vulnerable to poverty when the economy is hit by economic shocks. Nonincome \npoverty is equally serious as many Indonesians lack access to basic services. \n \n4.  The Government recognizes that, while economic growth will remain fundamental to \nreducing  poverty,  improved  social  service  delivery  and  better  targeted  public  expenditure \nthrough modern systems of social protection are essential to counter income and nonincome \npoverty. The Government has undertaken several steps to improve social service delivery under \nthe fiscal decentralization policy.6 For social protection, the current publicly provided system is \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998.

The first includes targeted efforts to provide economic \nor social support for the poor, such as the ad hoc social safety net introduced after the crisis, \ncash transfer scheme, and other pro-poor programs. These programs have shown mixed results \ndue to lack of targeting and leakages. The second intervention is through contributory social \ninsurance  and  mandatory  saving  for  civil  servants  (TASPEN  and  ASKES),  armed  forces \n(ASABRI), and formal sector employees (JAMSOSTEK). The system suffers from a number of \nsignificant weaknesses. The coverage of the existing contributory social insurance system is \nvery low; only about 16 million workers out of more than 100 million are covered by fragmented \nschemes. The informal sector, employing more than 65% of the total workforce, is largely \nexcluded from the existing system.  \n \n5.  The enactment of Law 40/2004 for the SJSN provides an opportunity to bring about a \ncomprehensive reform of the existing system. The objective of the law is to implement a viable, \nefficient,  and  transparent  SJSN  that  serves  the  needs  of  all  Indonesians.  It  requires  the \nestablishment of five social insurance programs\u2014health, workers compensation, pension, old-\nage savings, and death benefits. The law envisages that the Government will pay for the social \nsecurity contribution of the poor. The Government has formed a task force, headed by the \nCoordinating  Ministry  of  People\u2019s  Welfare,  to  work  on  introducing  new  regulations  and \nharmonizing existing regulations. As stipulated in the law, the task force is required to complete \nall required implementing regulations by the legal deadline in October 2009.  \n \n6.  The improvement of the existing system and gradual implementation of the SJSN will be \na  long-term  process,  covering  different  phases,  starting  with  a  policy  debate  among \nstakeholders and preparation of the system design, and followed by institutional development \nand capacity building leading to a new administrative system. International experience suggests \nthat overall implementation efforts of the pension and old-age savings programs will require a \nminimum of 2\u20133 years. The law provides for a transition period of 5 years before the new \nsystem is expected to become operational. Efforts to prepare implementation of the SJSN have \nintensified since 2007 and ADB has supported the Government through staff analysis to prepare \na series of background studies to review existing programs and compute the fiscal costs of the \nproposed programs envisaged under the SJSN Law. Currently, ADB is providing assistance to \ndevelop a draft white paper containing a design of all five social insurance programs. The white \npaper will provide a road map and inputs for the preparation of implementing regulations for the \nSJSN Law.  \n \n7.  The new social security system under the SJSN will need to be affordable to workers, \nemployers, and the Government. The SJSN Law outlines the broad structure of the new social \ninsurance system but leaves many key elements, including contributions and benefits, to future \nlaws and regulations. This will require agreement among stakeholders on program design, \nadministration  and  governance,  and  the  drafting  of  appropriate  implementing  laws  and \nregulations. To support the process, a proper macroeconomic study will need to be conducted \nto determine the maximum contributions as a percent of wages that can be required from \nworkers  and  their  employers.  Introduction  of  the  SJSN  programs  must  not  undermine  the \nregional  and  international  competitiveness  of  Indonesian  businesses  and  not  increase \nunemployment or discourage the creation of new jobs, particularly for low-paid workers.   \n \n8.  The new social security system will need to be affordable to the Government. Various \noptions need to be carefully studied to ensure that the SJSN programs are affordable in the \n                                                                                                                                                          \nand Recommendation of the President on a Proposed Program Cluster and Loan for Subprogram I to the Republic \nof Indonesia for the Second Local Government Finance and Governance Reform Program. Manila.   \n ", "  3 \nshort and medium term. This will require that programs are phased in carefully. In addition, \nsocial security reform will have two-way effects on the state budget. The payment of the social \nsecurity contribution for the poor as mandated by the law will increase spending, while an \nimproved security system will assist the Government\u2019s efforts in shifting large and volatile \nuntargeted subsidies currently burdening the budget.  \n \n9.  Concurrent to the higher priority given to the fiscal implications and sustainability of the \nsocial security program, the Government is planning to enhance its capacity to anticipate a \nrange  of  shocks  that  could  have  significant  poverty  and  fiscal  implications.  Continued \nimprovement in macroeconomic stability is essential to the Government\u2019s effort to increase \neconomic growth and reduce poverty. With many households clustered around the poverty line, \nexperience suggests that a short period of economic instability can have an adverse impact on \nthe poverty rate. For example, macroeconomic turbulence in 2006 increased the number of poor \nby more than 4 million. The recent increase in domestic inflation, driven by the surge in global \nfood and fuel prices, has hampered Government poverty reduction efforts. \n \n10.  The Government has made significant progress in reducing vulnerabilities that make the \ncountry susceptible to economic instability. However, recent global economic developments \nclearly indicate that new challenges are emerging. Increased volume of short-term capital flows, \nrapid  correction  of  global  imbalance,  and  volatile  fuel  and  commodity  prices  complicate \nmacroeconomic management. The Government needs to be equipped with an up-to-date and \ncomprehensive  economic  monitoring  system  to  ensure  that  new  potential  sources  of \nvulnerabilities are quickly detected and appropriate policy responses are developed in a timely \nmanner. Presidential Instruction No. 6/2007, which aims to accelerate real sector development, \nincludes the enhancement of the economic monitoring system as one of the policy actions to be \nimplemented. Subsequently, the Fiscal Policy Office (FPO) established an internal team to work \nwith the Financial Sector Stability Forum and significantly improved its data monitoring system. \nAn improved capacity in analyzing the sources of economic vulnerabilities will not only help the \nGovernment  develop  appropriate  policy  responses,  but  also  lead  to  better  annual  budget \npreparation, which is essential in increasing space for more efficient social protection.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n. \n11.  The expected impact of the TA is more inclusive economic growth by supporting the \nGovernment in implementing a more efficient and sustainable social protection system. The \nexpected  outcome  of  the  TA  is  to  enhance  the  Government's  social  security  reform  and \nmacroeconomic monitoring capacity. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The key expected outputs are (i) final design of the social security system, including \ncontribution and benefit structure, and support for key implementation aspects of the system;  \n(ii) capacity building support to the Risk Management Unit (RMU) to enhance staff capacity in \nanalyzing  fiscal  implications  and  economywide  effects  of  alternative  social  security  reform \noptions; and (iii) support for the Government\u2019s initiative to enhance its economic monitoring \nsystem to anticipate a range of shocks that could have significant poverty, macroeconomic, and \nfiscal implications. To ensure sustainability, the consultants will provide (i) formal training for  \n10\u201315 staff of FPO and RMU; (ii) on-site training and mentoring for trainees; and (iii) assistance \non repeated use of the models and economic monitoring system. An ADB team will monitor \n ", "4   \nprogress on capacity building efforts and provide necessary feedback to achieve the intended \nresults. \n \n13.  Output 1: Social Security System is Finalized. This will support the Insurance Bureau \nof Bapepam-LK at the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to facilitate consultations among stakeholders \non the design of all five SJSN programs; finalize the detailed design of contributions and \nbenefits of the programs; complete the white paper, which will include fiscal and financial \nanalysis  supporting  the  design  of  alternative  options;  and  assist  the  Government  with  the \ndrafting of all necessary implementing regulations for the SJSN system. This component will be \nclosely coordinated with output 2 to ensure the reform options proposed in the final design are \nfiscally affordable in the short and long term. \n \n14.  Output 2: FPO and RMU Provide Analytical Reports of Fiscal Implications and \nEconomywide Effects of Social Security Reforms to Policy Makers. This component will \nsupport RMU to develop a pension model and prepare financial analysis and fiscal costs of \nvarious reform options for the SJSN programs. The TA will assist RMU to refine the budget \nmodel to conduct fiscal sustainability analysis, assess the macroeconomic risks affecting the \nbudget, and upgrade the computable general equilibrium model of the Indonesian economy \npreviously built in FPO to quantify the economywide effects of introducing SJSN programs and \nother policy changes.  \n \n15.  Output  3:  Government's  Economic  Monitoring  System  is  Operating.  This \ncomponent will provide medium-term support for FPO in its efforts to improve and maintain the \nmacroeconomic monitoring system. The consultant will (i) identify areas where the current \nsystem can be improved, including data quality and coverage; (ii) enhance and develop the \nanalytical framework for each macroeconomic sector; (iii) assist in developing an analytical \nmacro model to produce a macroeconomic outlook; and (iv) support output 2 to enhance the \nexisting budget model. This component will assist FPO in developing an analytical paper on \nstrategic macroeconomic and fiscal issues as requested by MOF. \n \n16.  This  TA  will  be  complemented  by  a  regional  technical  assistance  (RETA),7 which \nprovides support for new and ongoing initiatives to social protection in developing member \ncountries and capacity building through participation in international conferences, training, and \nknowledge exchange. The RETA will provide short-term consultant services to support efforts \nrelated to this TA. For the economic monitoring, a critical component of the system is the early \nwarning system (EWS). The Office of the Regional Economic Integration (OREI) has provided \nassistance to develop a simple version of the EWS and train a number of government officials \nfrom relevant institutions through RETAs.8 OREI has agreed to provide support in developing \nthe information technology platform of the EWS and continue inviting Indonesian officials (from \nMOF and Bank Indonesia) to participate in OREI training programs on EWS. The Indonesia \nResident Mission responded to an earlier request from FPO by providing short-term assistance \nin this area and is currently in the process of preparing a follow-up TA to customize the EWS. \nThis TA will focus on macroeconomic and fiscal-related aspects of the monitoring system, while \nthe resident mission will assist with the broader aspects of the EWS, including customizing the \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2008.

This  TA  will  be supplemented  by \nactivities of other development partners, including the World Bank and German development \ncooperation  (through  Gesellchaft fur  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  [GTZ]),  as  well  as  other \nassistance from ADB. The World Bank has been providing assistance to MOF on civil servant \npension and saving programs. German Development Cooperation through GTZ is providing \nassistance on old- age saving and has been supporting National Development Planning Agency  \non social security issues. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $960,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide \n$800,000.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The \nGovernment will provide in-kind contribution equivalent to $160,000 through the provision of \ncounterpart  staff,  office  space  and  utilities,  administrative  services,  and  physical  facilities. \nAppendix 3 gives the details of cost estimates and the financing plan.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  FPO of MOF will be the Executing Agency because of its mandate to (i) develop and \nenhance the economic monitoring and the early warning system, and (ii) improve fiscal risk \nmanagement.  Within  MOF,  the  Insurance  Bureau  of  Bapapem-LK  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing  social  security  reform  activities,  coordinating  closely  with  RMU  on  capacity \nbuilding for the pension model. To facilitate advance disbursements for workshops, publications, \nand statistical software under the three components will require access to an advance payment \nfacility.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, as amended from time to time). Software, licenses, \nand other equipment needed during project implementation will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). All equipment purchased \nby  the  consultants  will  be  turned  over  to  FPO  according  to  ADB  procedures  after  TA \nimplementation. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from January 2009 to December 2010. ADB \nwill recruit international and national consultants on an individual basis to implement activities. \nConsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). A total of 42 (30 international and 12 national) persons-\nmonths of consultant services will be required. Appendix 4 presents outline terms of reference \nfor the consultants. \n \n20.  The consultants will be responsible for providing reports and deliverables as required \nunder their terms of references. Each component will produce a final report on activities. The \nADB team leader will compile all deliverables and monitor the quality of the reports. The timing \nof each TA activity will be determined in consultation with MOF. \n \nIV.
