INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Uzbekistan requested support from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to strengthen its transformation into a modern industrial and service economy through \nsustained and inclusive growth, a reduction in poverty, and expanded regional cooperation.1 \nThe proposal was discussed in detail with the government during three ADB missions in May, \nJune,  and  October  2016.  The  government  concurred  with  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants of the proposed policy and advisory technical assistance (TA). The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The government is pursuing an ambitious development agenda to achieve rapid and \nbroad-based economic growth through economic diversification, industrial modernization, and \ninfrastructure development.3 Anticipating and addressing labor market challenges has become a \ngovernment priority, with an increase of more than 30% in the working age population projected \nby 2030 and a rising unemployment rate (5.2% in 2015).4 As one of the youngest countries in \nAsia, with almost 60% of the population under the age of 30, Uzbekistan will require a high rate \nof  job  creation  and  well-functioning  labor  markets  to  absorb  this  economically  active  and \ngrowing population.5 \n \n3.  Successive government industrial modernization policies (2011\u20132015 and 2015\u20132019) \noutlined  key  economic  objectives,  including  targets  for  growth  in  gross  domestic  product, \nexpanding the share of industry value added in gross domestic product, rehabilitating roads, \nand increasing access to utilities for rural populations. Target areas under the strategy include \noil  and  gas,  electricity,  chemicals  and  petrochemicals,  and  metallurgy.  The  government\u2019s \nstrategy seeks to expand the middle class, promote shared prosperity, and eliminate poverty \nthrough the creation of quality jobs for its citizens. \n \n4.  Uzbekistan\u2019s skills development system faces several challenges and is not well placed \nto support the government\u2019s economic modernization agenda. Employers in the country report \nthat inadequate workforce skills pose a significant obstacle to firm growth: (i) 73% of employers \nin a 2008 survey identified inadequate skills as an obstacle to doing business, up from 60% in \n2005; and (ii) 35% of firms in a 2013 survey conducted by the World Bank reported that \nemployee skills posed a major or very severe obstacle to growth.6 Industrial enterprises were \nvery likely to experience difficulties in finding workers with the right skills, with nearly half \nreporting  a  lack  of  qualified  specialists  with  a  higher  education  degree  (footnote  6).                 \nOther evidence shows a mismatch between the number of graduates and the number of jobs \ncreated in different fields of study. This is particularly true for specialized senior secondary \nschool graduates, but also for higher education graduates.7 While progress has been made in \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2015.

The quality of education is also highlighted as a concern.8           \nThe World Bank has characterized labor market information systems as weak, and highlighted \nthe adverse effects this may have on job search and skills signaling. In particular, it noted that \nworkers do not have ready access to information on job openings, job search strategies, and \nways of effectively presenting their qualifications to prospective employers (footnote 7). \n \n5.  The TA is expected to focus on addressing skills needs in micro and small enterprises \n(MSEs), which are defined as firms with up to 100 employees.9 These firms are estimated to \nrepresent more than 99% of all enterprises in Uzbekistan and provide employment to more \nthan 77% of all workers in the country. Some aspects of the TA will focus on three geographic \nareas of the country: Navoi region, Angren district of Tashkent region, and Andijan region, \nwhich account for about 43% of MSEs in Uzbekistan. These three geographic areas were \nselected because (i) they are classified as economic free zones or special economic areas; (ii) \nMSEs contribute significantly to gross regional product in these three geographic areas (51.4% \nin Andijan, 24.9% in Navoi, and 41.9% in Tashkent); and (iii) the government has identified \nthem as the key areas for industrial modernization and job creation. The needs of MSEs differ \nsharply from those in large enterprises; they have greater challenges in identifying skills needs \nand they train employees up to 50% less than large firms.10 \n \n6.  Uzbekistan\u2019s labor market has significant gender gaps, and the number of economically \nactive  women  remains  considerably  lower  than  the  number  of  economically  active  men. \nAlthough women make up almost half of the adult labor force (46%), employment rates show a \nclear  gender  gap.  During  2007\u20132010,  employment  among  men  grew  more  rapidly  than \nemployment among women\u201410.8% for men versus only 5.5% for women. During that same \nperiod, the proportion of women in the working population decreased while the proportion of \nmen increased. Unemployment rates in Uzbekistan show distinct gender patterns. The official \nunemployment rate for women has consistently been higher than for men. There is some \nindication that women are not seeking jobs at the same rate as men, or at least are not using \nofficial channels for assistance. Unemployed women generally spend more time looking for \njobs than men and, on average, remain unemployed for more than a year.11 \n \n7.  Reforms  and  investment  in  the  skills  development  sector  in  Uzbekistan  could  yield \nsignificant returns. A study concluded that further investment in education and skills would \nimprove labor market outcomes, support growth in the new economy and private sector, and \ngive impetus to regional economic development.12 \n \n8.  The  government  is  aligning  its  policies  and  strategies  to  the  following  Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs): quality education (SDG 4), decent work and economic growth \n(SDG 8), and reduced inequalities (SDG 10). The TA will develop policy design capacity to \npursue the SDG targets to help ensure socioeconomic development that is inclusive for the \n                                                \n8  M.

Impacts and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the project is aligned with skills developed and decent jobs created for \ndisadvantaged groups.13 The outcome will be a framework for a more effective and relevant \nskills  development  system  that  supports  industrial  modernization  and  inclusive  growth \ndeveloped.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will have three outputs: \n \n(i)  Skills  demand  and  supply  identified  and  analyzed  in  three  geographic \nareas:  Navoi  region,  Angren  district  of  Tashkent  region,  and  Andijan \nregion. This output will involve the development and pilot testing of a survey to \ndetermine current and expected employer demand for skills in Navoi region, \nAngren district of Tashkent region, and Andijan region. It will also assess the \nsupply of skills being provided through the TVET system in Uzbekistan and \nassess the degree of mismatch between skills supply and demand. The survey is \nexpected  to  be  conducted  with  a  sample  of  at  least  100 firms  in  the  three \nidentified regions. The survey instrument and methodology developed under the \nTA  will  provide  a  platform  for  the  government  to  institutionalize  regular \nassessments of skills supply and demand in the country. The TA will also assess \ngovernment  capacity  development  and  other  requirements  in  relation  to \ninstitutionalizing  labor  market  surveys.  The  analysis  will  include  a  gender-\ndisaggregated assessment of skills supply and demand. \n \n(ii)  Skills  monitoring  system  to  address  emerging  jobs  designed  and  pilot \nprogram established. This output will involve designing and establishing a pilot \nskills monitoring system, including gender-disaggregated components, to monitor \nthe changing demands for skills, identify changes in industry skills needs, and \nprovide  information  for  TVET  providers  to  adjust  program  offerings  to  meet \nemerging skill demands. This system will include mechanisms for anticipating \nand responding to changing skills needs resulting from shifts in regional trade \npatterns and the emergence of greening key sectors such as energy and water. \nSpecific  outputs  will  include  (a)  developing  and  establishing  a  pilot  skills \nmonitoring system model relevant to Uzbekistan, (b) identifying capacity-building \nneeds for the operation of the skills monitoring system, and (c) designing and \nestablishing a knowledge-sharing platform to facilitate industry partnerships.14 \n \n                                                \n13 The  government\u2019s  National  Development  Strategy  2016\u20132020  incorporates  several  Presidential  resolutions, \nincluding: Government of Uzbekistan. 2015.

Cheltenham, United Kingdom: Edward Elgar. \n ", "4 \n(iii)  Possible  reform  and  program  design  options  to  improve  the  skills \ndevelopment  system  identified  and  assessed. This output will assess the \nTVET sector in Uzbekistan, including the identification of key challenges facing \nthe sector, strengths and weaknesses of the existing framework, and possible \nreforms to the regulatory and funding framework that would help to improve the \nefficiency, quality, and relevance of the skills development system. This output \nwill also identify and assess possible program design options to improve the \noperation of the TVET system, including revisions to curricula and programs, \nqualifications  frameworks  and  skills  certification,  labor  market  information \nsystems, capacity-building measures, mechanisms to increase linkages between \nthe TVET system and enterprises, investment requirements, and the introduction \nof innovative models for financing and delivering TVET. The TA will also identify \npossible assistance that may be required to support improvements in the skills \ndevelopment  system,  including  identifying  broad  preliminary  costs  and  any \npotential safeguards issues. \n \n11.  Key assumptions for the TA include the government\u2019s continued commitment to reform \nskills  development  and  labor  market  policies  and  its  continued  high  priority  for  industrial \nmodernization  consistent  with  TA  recommendations.  Risks  for  the  TA  include  (i)  domestic \ninstability or fiscal constraints that divert government efforts to other priorities, (ii) insufficient or \nno collaboration from local stakeholders in the planned activities, and (iii) personnel changes in \nthe executing agency leading to inability to coordinate effectively with all agencies involved. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $900,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of staff, office accommodation, office supplies, and other \nin-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The executing agency will be the Ministry of Labor (MOL). ADB will administer the TA. A \nsteering committee is being formed to oversee TA implementation and provide interministerial \ncoordination. Its members include the MOL, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance, and the \nMinistry of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education. The implementing agencies will be \n(i) the Center for Secondary Specialized Vocational Education under the Ministry of Higher and \nSecondary Specialized Education, and (ii) the National Scientific Center for Employment and \nLabor Protection under MOL. A working group, which will report to the steering committee, has \nbeen established. It will provide day-to-day support to TA implementation. The TA will be \nimplemented from January 2017 to January 2018. The TA is categorized as gender equity as a \ntheme. \n \n14.  ADB will recruit a firm to implement the TA. Individual consultants may also be engaged \nto undertake particular tasks, including TA coordination. All consultants will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).  The  selection  method  will  be  quality-  and  cost-based  selection,  using  full  technical \nproposals, with a 90:10 weighting of technical and financial scores. Performance (output) terms \nof reference will be used with a minimum of three key experts, one of which will be the team \nleader: (i) labor market economist, (ii) skills development specialist, and (iii) labor market expert. \nThe TA will also mobilize resource persons as needed to provide expertise. Equipment under \n ", "5 \nthe TA will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time). TA funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Upon completion of the TA, \nequipment procured will be turned over to the executing agency. The outline terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  ADB will monitor the performance of the TA through regular TA review missions. ADB \nwill work closely with the steering committee in the coordination and implementation of the TA. \nA knowledge-sharing platform will be established to ensure the effective dissemination of TA \noutputs, including good practice and lessons learned. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 to the Government \nof Uzbekistan to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Skills \nStrategies for Industrial Modernization and Inclusive Growth, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Project is Aligned With: \nSkills developed and decent jobs created for disadvantaged groups.a \n \nData Sources \nPerformance Indicators with Targets and  and Reporting \nResults Chain  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nFramework for a  a.
