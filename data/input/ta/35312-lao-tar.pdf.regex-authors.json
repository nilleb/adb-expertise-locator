The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  significant  assistance  to  the \neducation sector in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). Other development \npartners have also provided significant support to the Lao PDR for primary education. In 2006, \nADB will support a sector development program that will focus on (i) policy reforms for sector \ndevelopment,  and  (ii)  investment  support  for  lower  secondary  education.  During  the  2006 \nCountry Programming Confirmation Mission,1 the Ministry of Education (MOE) of the Government \nrequested complementary advisory technical assistance (TA) to help develop a framework for \neducation sector development. The TA is included in the country strategy and program 2006\u2013\n20102 as  a  firm  2006  advisory  TA,  in  the  amount  of  $500,000,  to  be  financed  by  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The TA Fact-Finding Mission3 visited Vientiane from 1 to 3 November 2006 and reached \nan  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA. The TA supports \nthe Education Sector Development Plan 2006\u20132010, and is closely aligned with Education for \nAll  National  Plan  of  Action  (EFA  NPA).  The  TA  is  cast  within  the  Government\u2019s  broader \ncommitment to education reform and is linked to the Government\u2019s commitment to achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals and Education for All by 2015.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The Government recognizes that education and literacy are prerequisites for sustained \neconomic growth and poverty reduction. This idea is reflected in all its planning and visionary \ndocuments. However, despite the reiteration of commitment and the progress in expanding \naccess, the education sector still faces several challenges. These include (i) differentiated \naccess due to socioeconomic and geographic barriers, (ii) low internal efficiency, (iii) weak \ncapacity  for  planning  and  management  of  education  delivery,  and  (iv)  budgetary  resource \nconstraints. \n \n4.  The  Lao  PDR  has  made  substantial  gains  in  expanding  access  to  education.  Net \nenrollment  ratios 4  (NER)  for  primary  education  have  increased  from  63%  in  1990  to \napproximately 79% in 2005. During the same period, gross enrollment ratios5 (GER) for lower \nsecondary education increased from 30% to 51%. For upper secondary education, the GER has \nalso shown rapid increases, rising from 26.3% in 2003 to 31% in 2005. Girls\u2019 enrollment has \nalso risen rapidly, thus reducing gender differentials.  At the primary level, gender differentials in \nenrollment have dropped by 7.4% since 1996 (from 21.6% to 14.2%). At the lower secondary \nlevel, girls\u2019 enrollment increased by more than 4% between 2003 and 2005 compared with a \n1.9% increase for boys.  However, despite the rapid enrollment growth, national enrollment \nstatistics  hide  the  significant  disparities  caused  by  gender,  ethnicity,  economic  status,  and \ngeographic location.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 24 August 2006. \n2  ADB. 2006. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic: Country Strategy and Program. Manila. \n3  The Fact-Finding Mission was undertaken by Ms. Sukhdeep Brar, senior education specialist, Southeast Asia \nSocial Sectors Division. \n4  Net enrollment ratio is the ratio of the number of children of official school age enrolled in school to the number of \nchildren of official school age in the population. \n5  Gross enrollment ratio is the ratio of total enrollment, regardless of age, to the population of the age group that \nofficially corresponds to the level of education shown. \n ", "2   \n5.  Universal access to primary education is still a major challenge. Approximately 23% of \nprimary school-age children are not enrolled in school. Of those enrolled, over 8% drop out. \nAccess to schooling in rural, remote regions continues to be limited. At the primary level, \napproximately 15% of the villages are still without a school within commutable distance.6 About \n57% of all primary schools, and an estimated 70\u201380% of schools in the poorest districts do not \noffer the full five grades of primary education. Low population densities and remoteness make it \ndifficult to provide cost-effective and sustainable education services in remote, rural areas. Thus, \nchildren in the poorest areas, particularly girls and ethnic groups, are distinctly disadvantaged \nby limited access to education.  \n \n6.  Girls suffer greater disadvantage from limited access to schools. At the primary level, the \nNER for girls is 49% in rural areas without access to roads, 72.2% in rural areas with access to \nroads, and 90.5% in urban areas. Corresponding statistics for boys are 56%, 75%, and 88%, \nrespectively. At the primary level, 48% of girls complete schooling compared with 52% of boys. \nIn rural areas, girls\u2019 enrollment grows at a much slower rate than that of boys. This gap affects \nenrollments in entry grades at the lower and upper secondary levels.  \n7.  The expansion of education has not been matched by corresponding gains in quality. \nDropout and repetition rates are high, particularly at the initial stages of primary education. \nApproximately 33% of students repeat grade 1 and another 19% repeat grade 2. It takes an \naverage of 8 years to complete the 5-year primary education cycle.  \n \n8.  The rapid expansion of primary education has fueled the demand for lower and upper \nsecondary education. This rapid expansion, under severe financial constraints, has not been \nmatched by an increase in teachers or additional physical facilities.  As a result, class sizes are \nlarge, with national averages reaching as high as 81 pupils per class in 2004\u20132005. Overall \nteacher qualifications are also low. Nationally, 22% of teachers have completed only primary \neducation and over 20% of all teachers have had no training. There is also a serious shortage of \ntext books, learning materials, and teacher guides.  \n \n9.  Following educational trends in developing economies, the demand for education in all \nsubsectors will continue to grow rapidly. The main challenge will be to meet that growing \ndemand for education, address issues of equity, and improve the internal efficiency of the \nsystem to strengthen the quality of education. The Government, in its draft Sixth National Socio-\neconomic Development Plan (2006\u20132010), lays down for each education subsector targets that \nare linked to expansion of enrollments as well as improved efficiencies within the system. \nHowever, inadequate resources and weak capacity for planning, management, and delivery of \neducation are serious constraints to achieving these targets.  \n \n10.  External assistance to education in the Lao PDR is substantial and accounts for over \n70% of the education expenditures. ADB is a major funding agency in education and has \nsupported four education projects since 1991, three of them focused on primary education. The \nWorld Bank has provided support through Education Development Project (EDP) I and II in \n1993 and 2004, respectively. The Government of Sweden has financed the Teacher Training \nEnhancement and Status of Teachers (TTEST) project that produced the National Teacher \nEducation Action Plan. The Government of Japan has provided grant assistance for teacher \ntraining and primary school construction. The Government of Australia has provided grants for \nin-service and preservice training for ethnic teachers and the development of supplementary \n                                                 \n6  The internationally recommended norm for \u201ccommutable distance\u201d for primary school is 1 km from the place of \nhabitation. There are no corresponding norms for lower and upper secondary schools.  \n ", "  3\nlearning materials, and was cofinancier for the ADB-supported Basic Education for Girls Project. \nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) helped develop \nthe EFA NPA7 that provides a common framework for assistance to basic education.  \n \n11.  The main focus of external assistance to the education sector has been on expansion of \naccess for primary education, particularly for disadvantaged children in poor, remote areas. \nWhile this has resulted in increased enrollments, particularly in the targeted areas, it has also \ncontributed  to  some  of  the  quality  issues  enumerated  above.  Capital  investments  through \nexternal assistance have been disproportionate to the Government\u2019s ability to provide for the \nensuing recurrent costs. This has resulted in a severe shortage of teachers, textbooks, and \nlearning materials. The Government\u2019s inability to pay teacher salaries in a timely manner acts as \na  deterrent  to  attracting  better  qualified  teachers.    These  factors  have  a  serious  ongoing \nnegative impact on the quality of education.  \n12.  In  2004,  MOE  adopted  the  EFA NPA  which,  based  on enrollment  projections,  has \nestimated the need for additional school facilities, teachers, teaching learning materials, etc. \nwith supporting budgetary estimates up to 2015. However, it is limited by its focus on basic \neducation. It also does not provide an assessment of the institutional and management capacity \nneeded  to  manage  the  expansion  of  education.  A  policy  framework  to  operationalize  the \nGovernment\u2019s education goals is also lacking. Since 2002, MOE has been working with the \nSwedish International Development Agency (Sida) to develop a sector-wide approach, but is \nconstrained by weak capacity and a lack of clarity as to what constitutes such an approach. \nADB\u2019s  Basic  Education  Sector  Development  Program  that  extends  assistance  to  lower \nsecondary education and supports policy reforms aimed at strengthening systemic capacity for \nplanning, budgeting, and management for school education that will help MOE move toward a \nmore holistic sector-wide approach to education sector development   \n13.  MOE recognizes the need for improved sector-wide planning to address some of the key \ndeficiencies of the education sector and, in particular, to ensure a more balanced approach to \neducation development. As a first step, MOE is attempting to restructure itself internally to \nharmonize  the  implementation  structures  for  externally  assisted  projects.  The  development \nagencies  also  recognize  the  need  for  more  strategic  and  long-term  planning  to  ensure  a \ncoordinated and balanced approach to education sector development. There is also a growing \nrecognition that haphazard investments have contributed to some of the problems that the \nsector confronts today and external assistance needs to be better coordinated. A sector-wide \nframework  for  education  sector  development  will  address  these  key  concerns  and  allow \ndevelopment agencies to adopt a longer-term strategy for support to the education sector in \ntheir niche areas in close coordination and cooperation with MOE and other development agencies.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of the advisory TA will be a strengthened capacity for education sector \ndevelopment. The TA will accomplish this by assisting MOE to develop a sector-wide framework \nfor education by analyzing enrollment trends and the impact these will have on sector issues. \nThe TA will assess the projected expansion of enrollments at the primary, lower, and upper \nsecondary level and the impact this expansion will have on the demand for physical facilities; \nteachers; textbooks and learning materials; institutional and management capacity at all levels \nof education management and delivery, and establish priorities to match resource availability. \n                                                 \n7   MOE. 2004.

The TA will result in a sector-wide framework for developing the school sector based on \nprojected  enrollment  expansion.  The  framework  will  have  the  following  outputs:  (i)  an \nassessment of the projected growth of enrollments at the primary, lower secondary, and upper \nsecondary levels taking into account the projections for dropout rates,  repetition rates, etc. to \ndetermine the final flow rates from one subsector to the next; (ii) projected demand for new \nschools/classrooms and laboratories and libraries, additional teachers, learning materials, text \nbooks, etc.; (iii) the institutional capacity required in MOE, line agencies,8 teacher training \ninstitutions, and other key areas such as examinations, etc., to manage the projected expansion \nof different levels of the school sector; (iv) planning and management capacity, including data \nsystems, and monitoring and evaluation systems, that needs to be developed to meet the \nprojected expansion; (v) an action plan for coordinating activities that support the quality of \nschool  education  (curriculum  revisions,  development  of  textbooks  and  supporting  learning \nmaterials  and  teacher  guides,  in-service  teacher  training,  and  student  assessment  and \nexaminations); (vi) assessment of financial sustainability of education in the medium and long \nterm; and (vii) a comprehensive matrix of policy actions necessary to support education reforms \nin the medium and long term. The TA will also examine issues of supply of and demand for \nteachers and identify gaps. The role of the private sector in providing education as well as \nteacher training may be explored. The TA will also assess projected enrollments in a 3-year \nkindergarten program and the feasibility of its introduction nationwide as opposed to a 1-year \npreschool addition to primary education. \n \n16.  The framework will cover a period of 10 years with three phases, with each phase being \nself-sufficient in inputs necessary to support the expansion of enrollments anticipated to occur \nduring that phase.  The framework will allow (i) comprehensive projection of the education \nsector\u2019s resource requirements, (ii) coordinated and complementary external assistance, and \n(iii) more balanced sector development.  \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  The TA will carry out a comprehensive analysis of the demand and supply issues based \non current and projected enrollments across the school sector. Among the issues are (i) the \nrequirements of additional schools, classrooms, libraries, and laboratories; (ii) the demand for \nadditional teachers, textbooks, learning materials, etc.; (iii) institutional capacity required to deal \nwith  the  expansion  of the  education  sector; and  (iv)  the  preparation  of  a  phased  10-year \nframework for education sector development. The framework will take a three-phase approach \nallowing  for  review  and  correction  as  necessary.  The  phasing  will  be  discussed  and \nincorporated in the inception report. The TA will take into account other activities and initiatives \nof the Government, as well as the activities of other funding agencies involved in the education \nsector. It will particularly build on the EFA NPA and extend education sector development to \ninclude upper secondary education. The TA will also actively involve officials in the relevant line \nagencies,  development  partners,  and  other  stakeholders  through  focus  group  discussions, \nmeetings, workshops, etc., to ensure that the framework has broad stakeholder consensus.  \nRepresentatives of development partners will be invited to participate in all group discussions, \nmajor meetings, and workshops.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is expected to cost $600,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide $500,000. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government\u2019s \n                                                 \n8  Line agencies include departments and institutions. \n ", "  5\nsupport to the TA, estimated at $100,000 equivalent, will be in kind and will include (i) office \naccommodation and utilities, (ii) remuneration of counterpart staff, and (iii) support for meetings, \netc. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  MOE will be the Executing Agency. A steering committee will provide overall guidance to \nthe TA. The steering committee will be chaired by the minister of education and will include \nrepresentatives from Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Foreign Affairs; relevant MOE officials, and \ndirectors of MOE line agencies.  MOE will also appoint working groups for the core areas of the \nTA\u2019s  outputs.  Members  of  the  working  groups  will  be  drawn  from  MOE  and  relevant  line \nagencies. The working groups will work closely with the consultant team to project growth trends, \nand assess the needs of the education sector to support the growth trends and to develop a \nframework for phased and complementary expansion with supporting inputs to improve and \nsustain the quality of education.  The TA team will work closely with all relevant line agencies \nand departments of MOE, and MOE will provide suitably qualified counterpart staff to facilitate \nthe consultations to be undertaken by the TA team.  \n \n20.  A team of five international and five national consultants will be recruited to provide \nspecialist services totaling 36 person-months (19 person-months international and 17 person- \nmonths national). The consultants will be recruited following ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2006, as amended from time to time), using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod and a simplified technical proposal. The specialists will have expertise in (i) institutional \ncapacity building; (ii) teacher development and training; (iii) school curriculum development and \ntextbooks;  (iv)  assessment  and  examinations;  and  (v)  education  policy,  management,  and \nfinance. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. All procurement under the TA will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time to \ntime). Upon TA completion, the equipment will be handed over to MOE.  \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over an 8\u2013month period. It will start in March 2007 and end \nin October 2007. The team leader will submit an inception report to ADB within 1 month of start-\nup. This will be followed by a national workshop to (i) clarify the TA\u2019s purpose and strategy, (ii) \ndiscuss the issues to be addressed, and (iii) obtain feedback from all relevant stakeholders and \ncounterpart staff. The TA team will undertake extensive consultations at the national, regional, \nprovincial,  and  district  levels  to  ensure  adequate  participation  and  consultation  during  the \ndevelopment of the framework. Consultations will be in the form of workshops, meetings, and \ndiscussion groups, etc., to ensure broad stakeholder participation. The TA team will prepare an \ninterim report based on an assessment of institutional and management capacity in identified \nareas and submit it to ADB by the end of month 3. A draft final report will be prepared by the \nend of month 6. The draft will be presented at a national workshop. Using the feedback received, \nthe report will be finalized in the form of a 10-year framework for education sector development \nin three phases and submitted to ADB.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of
