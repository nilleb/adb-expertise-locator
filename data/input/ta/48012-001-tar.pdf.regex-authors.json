INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested that the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  provide  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the \ndevelopment  of  a  Strategy  for  Liaoning  North  Yellow  Sea  Regional  Cooperation  and \nDevelopment.1  Following a fact-finding mission in July 2015, the government and ADB reached \nan understanding on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, costs and \nfinancial arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services for the TA. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC is deepening its integration with the global economy. ADB has provided prior \ntechnical assistance to this effort, as reflected in its inputs to the preparation of the PRC\u2019s 13th \nFive  Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020.  The  PRC\u2019s  globalization  strategy,  issued  in  March  2015, \nrecognizes the importance of promoting regional cooperation and integration, both internally and \nas part of this outward-focused policy.3 It is also a focus area of the policy measures introduced \nby the government\u2019s revitalization strategy for the Northeast PRC, as elaborated in a 2014 State \nCouncil opinion.4  \n \n3.  Subregional  engagement  is  being  facilitated  through  the  participation  of  the  PRC\u2019s \nnortheastern  provinces in  the Greater Tumen  Initiative\u2019s  Northeast  Asia  Local  Cooperation \nCommittee.5 The objective of the committee is to facilitate practical cooperation among local \ngovernments in Northeast Asia regarding their common concerns for regional development, and \nto strengthen policy coordination between local and central governments.6 There is, however, \ncurrently no regional cooperation framework guiding these processes and developments. \n \n4.  Liaoning Province is well positioned to participate in the implementation of the PRC\u2019s \nglobalization strategy. It is the only coastal province in the Northeast PRC, and is a transport \nhub between the northeastern and central regions, and a key regional portal to the Eurasian \nContinental Bridge. The connection to Europe has recently been strengthened with the opening \nof the Yingkou\u2013Manzhouli\u2013Europe Railway. In addition, Dalian Jinpu New Zone is a strategic \nconnection for contact and cooperation between the PRC and the rest of  Northeast Asia, \nbecause of the province\u2019s position on the North Yellow Sea. The Dalian Jinpu New Zone \nfacilitates communication among the PRC, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mongolia, and Russia, \nand serves to explore new cooperation mechanisms.  \n \n5.  The  Liaoning  provincial  government  and  the  Liaoning  Provincial  Committee  of  the \nCommunist Party of China are examining ways to strengthen policies and guidance aimed at \ndeepening participation in the PRC\u2019s globalization strategy. This TA proposes to help lay the \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in ADB. 2015.

Taking  into  account  contributions  from  prior  regional \ndevelopment initiatives, the TA will support the development of a needs assessment, baseline \nstrategy, and implementation plan for Liaoning Province\u2019s regional cooperation and integration \npriorities.  It  will  also  deliver  targeted  research  on  key  bottlenecks  to  deepening  regional \nintegration,  and  study  the  domestic  and  international  experience  with  designing  and \nimplementing regional cooperation programs. To help Liaoning Province position itself to better \nbenefit from the recently concluded economic partnership agreement between Mongolia and \nJapan, the research will explore ways to increase Liaoning\u2019s attractiveness as a transit corridor \nand to support an anticipated increase in trade between Japan and Mongolia.  \n \n6.  These advisory products will guide the Liaoning Provincial Department of Finance (DOF) \nand other agencies involved in regional cooperation initiatives. They can serve as a model for \neasy and rapid replication by the PRC\u2019s other northeastern provinces.  \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA impact is aligned with the government\u2019s goals of augmenting cooperation among \ninternal subregions of Northeast PRC, and promoting regional cooperation in Northeast Asia. \nThe outcome will be adoption by Liaoning Province of a regional cooperation and integration \n(RCI) development strategy and implementation action plan. Achievement will be measured by \nthe submission for approval\u2014by the Liaoning provincial government\u2014 of an RCI development \nstrategy and action plan.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The impact and outcome of the TA will be achieved through the delivery of the following \noutputs: \n(i)  Status  report  and  impact  assessment  produced  on  implementation  of \nearlier  regional  development  programs  in  Liaoning  Province. These  will \nanalyze the extent to which prior initiatives have increased the competitiveness \nof Liaoning\u2019s economy, expanded trade (including transit traffic), and attracted \ninward investment. Regional development programs under review include the \n5+1 Program and the Liaoning Coastal Economic Belt development plan.7  The \nanalysis will identify the extent of ADB assistance to date for Liaoning provincial \ndevelopment, and will develop awareness among stakeholders of the need for a \nprovincial RCI strategy.  \n(ii)  Regional cooperation and integration priorities and models developed for \nLiaoning  Province. This encompasses the delivery of five technical studies \nexamining Liaoning\u2019s infrastructure, industrial structure and capacity, financial \nresource requirements, likely sources of investment capital, and domestic and \ninternational  experience  designing  and  implementing  regional  cooperation \n                                                \n7  The provincial government, in its 11th Five Year Plan, 2006\u20132010, presented the idea in 2005 of the \"Five Points \nand One Line\" development strategy, in which it is striving to build a coastal economic belt as an economic engine \nfor the province. The \"Five Points\" refers to the areas of Changxing Island Harbor Industrial Zone in Dalian, \nYingkou Coastal Industrial Base, Liaoxi Jinzhou Bay Coastal Economic Zone, Dandong Industrial Zone, and \nZhuanghe Huayuankou Industrial Zone in Dalian. The \"One Line\" refers to a road along the coastal areas, which is \nexpected to stimulate growth in the province's coastal economic belt. C. Liu. 2008. \u201cFive Points and One Line\u201d \nStrategy  Remains  Priority.  China  Daily.  14  August.  http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2008-\n08/14/content_6934201.htm \n \n ", "  3 \nprograms. Needs, opportunities, and requirements associated with realizing and \nbenefiting from the PRC\u2019s globalization aspirations in Liaoning Province will be \npresented. The studies will be published as knowledge products, and will target \nkey stakeholders such as potential investors, trading partners, and infrastructure \ndevelopment managers. The five technical studies developed under the program \nwill focus on: \n(a)  problems  associated  with  the  investment  and  financing  of  public \ninfrastructure  in  Liaoning  Province  in  the  context  of  the  PRC\u2019s \nglobalization strategy, including an examination of how to promote \nconstruction  of  infrastructure  in  Liaoning  Province  using  a  public\u2013\nprivate partnership model; \n(b)  the policy framework required to support international expansion of \nLiaoning  Province\u2019s  equipment  manufacturing  industry,  which  will \naddress reduction of risks facing outward investment, and creation of \nan environment conducive to foreign investment; \n(c)  Liaoning Province\u2019s sea\u2013rail multimodal transportation potential and \nits  fiscal  implications,  including  an  examination  of  key  nodes  and \nrelevant policy-based obstacles, and offering a fiscally robust policy \nproposal; \n(d)  seaport  resource  management  in  Liaoning  Province,  including  an \nassessment of provincial seaport capacity, markets and trade flows \nserved  (both  domestic  and  international),  infrastructure  asset \nmanagement practices, and the competitive environment within and \namong seaports; and recommendations on how to maximize capacity \nutilization and ensure that regional demand (including that generated \nby  implementation  of  the  Japan\u2013Mongolia  Economic  Partnership \nAgreement) is fully served; and \n(e)  relevant  domestic  and  international  experience  designing  and \nimplementing regional cooperation programs, including examination of \nthe experience and practices of other countries, and provinces and \ncities in the PRC. This study will examine analogous initiatives such \nas  Russia\u2019s  and  India\u2019s  \u201cNorth\u2013South  Corridor  Plan\u201d,  the  United \nStates\u2019 \u201cNew  Silk  Road  Plan\u201d,  and  Japan\u2019s \u201cSilk  Road  Diplomatic \nStrategy.\u201d The experience and practices of other provinces in the PRC \nin  attracting  investment,  managing  infrastructure  assets,  and \nsupporting  international  expansion  of  companies  based  in  these \nprovinces will be examined to identify good practices. \n(iii)  Regional  cooperation  and  integration  needs  assessment,  development \nstrategy, and implementation action plan for Liaoning Province developed. \nThe  basis  and  status  of  Liaoning\u2019s  participation  in  the  PRC\u2019s  globalization \nstrategy will be analyzed, linking it to efforts to revitalize the northeastern PRC. \nThe report will present the framework, basic paths, and policy system needed to \nguide Liaoning\u2019s implementation of the PRC\u2019s globalization strategy, and will \nidentify ways ADB can support it.8   \n \n9.  Overall, the TA will provide a roadmap for Liaoning Province to maximize RCI benefits in \nthe implementation of its obligations under the PRC\u2019s globalization strategy. It will identify \nmeasures the DOF can take to reduce barriers to interprovincial trade and commerce, and to \n                                                \n8  The needs assessment will be modeled on the four pillars of ADB\u2019s RCI strategy and the deliverables will be \nbroadly in line with the PRC\u2019s globalization strategy. \n ", "4   \ntrade and commerce within Northeast Asia in general. In particular, it will propose initiatives \nspecific to Liaoning that can (i) support robust implementation of the World Trade Organization\u2019s \nTrade Facilitation Agreement; and (ii) through proactive engagement with the PRC customs \nservice, establish more efficient trade transit in Liaoning.  \n \n10.  Stakeholder consultations will be supported by the conduct of an inception workshop \nand a final strategy dissemination and discussion workshop. Workshop discussions will be \nincorporated in the final RCI needs assessment, development strategy, and implementation \naction plan. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n  11.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of workshop and seminar venues; document translation \nand interpretation support for consultant missions, workshops, and seminars; other workshop \nand  seminar  logistics  and  hospitality  arrangements  (e.g.,  office  supplies  and  domestic \ntransportation); and other in-kind contributions. The value of the government\u2019s contribution is \nestimated to account for 20% of the total TA cost. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.    The Liaoning Provincial DOF will serve as the executing and implementing agency. As \nsuch,  the  DOF  will  supervise  the  day-to-day  work  of  the  consultants  and  take  overall \nresponsibility  for  workshops  and  other  stakeholder  consultations.
