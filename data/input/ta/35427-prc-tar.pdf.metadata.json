INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2001 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested ADB to provide a technical \nassistance (TA) to support Hebei Province in formulating a development strategy for taking \ngeographic advantage by strengthening market integration with Beijing and Tianjing and the \nBohai sea coastal area. As part of TA preparation, prior to TA fact-finding, a meeting was \nconvened with governmental officials and academic stakeholders to discuss the development \nproblems facing Hebei Province and how ADB might assist. An ADB fact-finding mission visited \nHebei Province on 22\u201325 July 2002. The Mission confirmed the need for the TA and reached an \nunderstanding  on  the  TA\u2019s  scope,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  terms  of  reference,  and \nimplementation arrangements.1 The logical framework of the TA is presented in Appendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Hebei Province is in the northern the PRC, encircling two large centers of economic \nactivity, Beijing and Tianjin. Hebei\u2019s territory covers 188,000 square kilometers (km2) and its \npopulation  is  66.14  million.  From  1980  to  2001,  Hebei\u2019s  provincial  economic  growth  rate \naveraged  10.6%2  annually.  In  2001,  Hebei\u2019s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  amounted  to \nCNY557.8 billion, 8.7% more than in 2000. Agricultural output grew by 5.3%, industrial output by \n8.4%, and service sector by 10.7%. \n \n3.  Hebei\u2019s geographic advantages include (i) close proximity to Beijing (population 13.8 \nmillion) and Tianjin (population 10 million), two of the PRC's largest cities; and (ii) access to the \nBohai Sea, which implies a potential for closer integration to the global economy. However, to \nturn these geographic advantages into actual development, Hebei must make greater efforts to \nintegrate its economy with those of Beijing and Tianjin.  In the past, coordination of economic \nactivities among the three regions was inadequate. This partly explains why development in the \nGreater Beijing-Tianjin area has lagged behind the dynamic economies that have developed in \nthe Pearl and Yangtze river deltas. During the 1990s, the Hebei economy grew at 11.6% per \nyear compared to an average of 15.3% per year for Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. (Yangtze \nRiver Delta areas) and 13.3% for Guangdong Province (the Pearl River Delta area). This slower \ndevelopment is also reflected in the different structures of the economies and standards of \nliving. State-owned enterprises (SOEs) accounted for 34.7% of the gross industrial output in \n2001 in Hebei, compared to 21.7% in Guangdong and an average of 8.7% in Jiangsu and \nZhejiang. As a result, per capita income in Hebei (CNY8,337) is much lower than that in \nGuangdong (CNY13,612) and Jiangsu and Zhejiang (averaging CNY13,737). \n \n4.       Although poverty has been reduced substantially in the past two decades, Hebei\u2019s fight \nagainst poverty is far from over. Of Hebei's 115 counties, 52 are poverty key counties. Poverty \nproblems are particularly severe in those areas. The fiscal revenue of the poverty counties \ncannot cover the salary of the Government officials and public entities such as school teachers \nand medical staff. Investments in basic education and public health are inadequate and the \nprovision of health and education services falls below that of other counties in the province. \nAfter the 1994 national fiscal reforms, the fiscal position of the poor areas deteriorated.   \n \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 28 August 2002. \n2 During the same period, the PRC\u2019s economic growth rate averaged 9.5% per year. ", "2   \n5.  A \u201cpoverty belt\u201d surrounds Beijing. About 3.3 million people in Hebei Province, or 6.6% of \nthe rural population, lived below the official poverty line3 in 2000, slightly more than double the \nnational average of 3%.  Following the international practice, an expenditure-based poverty line \nis equivalent to average per capita expenditure of CNY860 for rural areas. Using this measure, \nthe number of rural poor in Hebei is estimated to be 9.6 million, 18% of the rural population. The \nnumber  of  urban  poor  is  estimated  at  2  million  or  16%  of  urban  population  using  the \nmethodology developed under the ADB-financed Urban Poverty Study.4 \n \n6.        Environment problems are also a major concern in Hebei. The quality of the environment \nof Beijing and Tianjin depends, in part, on environmental conditions in Hebei. A large proportion \nof the drinking water of Beijing and Tianjin comes from Hebei. However, 61.3% of the water in \n42 rivers of seven water systems in Hebei is suitable only for industrial use. Land degradation is \na serious environment problem and contributes to dust storms that affect Beijing, Tianjin, and \nneighboring  countries.  About  54,000  km2  suffers  from  soil  erosion;  sand  encroachment  is \naffecting 1.7 million hectares. The grasslands in northern Hebei are being destroyed, which is \none  of  the  sources  of  sand  storms.  To  protect  the  environments  of  Beijing  and  Tianjin, \nenvironmental management measures need to be taken in the areas of Hebei surrounding \nthose cities. Industries and sources of pollution should not be established in these parts of \nHebei Province.   \n \n7.  The private sector is relatively underdeveloped in Hebei and is not playing its full role in \ncreating the necessary jobs to reduce poverty. Hebei needs to create jobs for new market \nentrants, redundant SOE and Government workers, rural migrants, and people living in poverty. \nThe private sector, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises and the service sector, will \nbe  the  engine  for  job  creation.  However,  excessive  regulation,  lack  of  transparency  and \npredictability, excessive bureaucracy, corruption, and lack of access to financing are obstacles \nto the development of the private sector. These problems need to be addressed to enable \nprivate sector development. \n \n8.  To take advantage of its proximity to Beijing, Tianjin, and the Bohai Sea, Hebei Province \ndecided  to  implement  a  \u201cTwo  Surrounding  Development  Strategy\u201d  in  the  mid  1990s.  The \nobjective  is  to  accelerate  Hebei\u2019s  social  and  economic  development  by  improving  market \nintegration with Beijing and Tianjin and the global economy. The main elements of the strategy \ninclude (i) upgrading the industrial structure, (ii) improving the ecology and environment, (iii) \ndeveloping industries that complement the economies of Beijing and Tianjin, (iv) accelerating \nthe development of small towns, (v) promoting tourism and the tertiary sector, and (vi) reducing \npoverty. The provincial government is aware of the need for structural reforms to promote social \nand economic development but requires assistance to develop workable strategies. \n \n9.   The provincial government is concerned about the impacts of the PRC's entry into the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO), because Hebei's economy is dominated by SOEs. There will \nbe  increasing  competition  with  the  five  traditional  pillar  industries  of  Hebei  (i.e.  steel, \nconstruction materials, pharmaceuticals, machinery, and food industries). It is unclear how \nthose industries should be restructured to meet the new challenges. Due to the increasing \nimports of agricultural products resulting from trade liberalization, the agriculture sector will also \nface competitive challenges and will need to be restructured.    \n \n                                                 \n3  The PRC\u2019s official poverty line, CNY625 per capita income, is a rural subsistence line that is low compared to \ninternational definitions of poverty.  \n4   ADB, ADTA PRC 3377, Final Report on  Urban Poverty Study in the PRC, 2001, Manila. \n ", "  3\n10.   Hebei\u2019s Tenth Five Year Development Plan 2001-2005 (TFYP) sets out the Province\u2019s \nvision for the development and targets an annual average 8\u20139% GDP growth rate and a 40% \nincrease of productivity. By 2005, per capita GDP is forecast to reach $1,200. Significant \nprogress is also expected in reducing poverty and sharing the benefits of economic growth \nwidely in society.  \n \n 11.    Hebei\u2019s TFYP emphasizes on the quality of growth and the sustainable development. The \n\u201cTwo Surrounding Development Strategy\u201d was retained as a key component of the TFYP. This \nreflects a growing role of market forces in the economy and the potential for Hebei to capitalize \non its close proximity to the economic power houses of Beijing and Tianjin. Key strategic themes \nin Hebei\u2019s TFYP include (i) relying on market-oriented reforms and innovations; (ii) promoting \nprivate sector development; (iii) protecting the environment; and (iv) improving the quality of life \nfor all, including programs to reduce poverty, develop human resources, and strengthen social \nsafety nets. \n \n12.  After  the  PRC\u2019s  accession  to  WTO  and  Beijing\u2019s  successful  bid  to  host  the  2008 \nSummer Olympic Games, Hebei\u2019s Strategy needs to be modified to fit the changed external and \ninternal environment. The provincial government has sought ADB\u2019s assistance to review and \nrevise the strategy. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  The  TA  will  help  the  Government  of  Hebei  Province  formulate  a  socioeconomic \ndevelopment strategy to adjust to joining the WTO by better using its relatively easy access to \nBeijing,  Tianjin,  and  global  markets.  The  new  strategy  will  address  (i)  the  ecological  and \nenvironmental sustainability of development in the Greater Beijing-Tianjin- Hebei region; (ii) \ngreater cooperation between Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei; (iii) pro-poor economic development; \nand (iv) an improved financing and investment environment for the private sector.  \nB.    Methodology and Key Activities  \n  \n14.  The  scope  of  the  study  includes  (i)  formulating  a  development  strategy  for  Hebei \nProvince  based  on  a  review  and  evaluation  of  the  experience  of  implementing  the  \u201cTwo \nSurrounding Development Strategy\u201d, the findings of the nine sector studies under this TA and \nthe changes of external development environment; (ii) identifying ways to eliminate the \u201cpoverty \nbelt\u201d surrounding Beijing and reduce the development gaps between Beijing and Tianjin and \nHebei Province; (iii) designing integrated policies and action plans for environmental protection, \npaying particular attention to strategies that will also help to protect the environment of Beijing \nand  Tianjin  and  identify  a  mechanism  for  Beijing  and  Tianjin  to  compensate  Hebei  for \nenvironmental  protection  and  resource  sharing;  (iv)  designing  a  fiscal  transfer  system  to \nstrengthen  the  development  capacity  of  the  poor  counties  and  villages;    (v)  based  on \ninternational experience, identifying the structural reforms and future directions for developing of \nthe traditional industries and reforming SOEs; (vi) formulating policies and action plans for \npromoting  private  sector  development;  (vii)  identifying  the  policy  and  action  plans  for \nurbanization and structural changes for agriculture; (viii) designing financing and investment \nsystems with suitable roles for government and  the nonstate sector; (ix) identifying policies and \n ", "4   \naction plans to accelerate the development of high tech industries; (x) designing policies to \ncapitalize  on  the  potential  of  coastal  areas  and  promote  the  integration  of  ports  with  the \nsurrounding urban and rural areas; and (xi) identifying ways to promote tourism development. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $800,000 equivalent, comprising $372,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $428,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  a  grant  of \n$600,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $228,000 equivalent of local \ncurrency cost. The Hebei government will contribute the balance of the local currency cost of \n$200,000 equivalent, which will include supporting studies on issues relevant to this TA such as \ncommodity transportation, real estate development, and urbanization. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan \nare given in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The Hebei Provincial Financial Department (HPFD) will be the Executing Agency for the \nTA.  HPFD  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  with  various  departments,  including  the \nDevelopment  Planning  Commission,  in  the  Hebei  provincial  government  and  formulating, \nimplementing, monitoring, and reviewing the findings of the study. HPFD will provide office \nspace and facilities, transportation, relevant information, and data collection for the study.   \n \n17.   The TA will be implemented over a period of 10 months beginning in December 2002, by \na team of international and domestic consultants. The consultants, to be engaged through firms \nor institutes, will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. The \nSimplified Technical Proposals and the Quality and Cost-Based selection method will be used.  \nThe  international  consultants  (11  person-months)  will  have  expertise  in  macroeconomic \nplanning and policy formulation, regional development, fiscal transfer systems, environmental \nmanagement, finance, industrial restructuring, and tourism. For the international consultants, \nsome  working  experience  in  the  PRC  is  preferable.  The  international  consultants  will  be \nresponsible for the overall report and introduction of international experience into the study. The \ninternational consultants will provide assistance to domestic consultants on designing study \noutlines, reviewing the sector reports and polishing the English version of the sector reports. \nThe  domestic  consultants  (48  person-months)  will  prepare  nine  sector  reports  under  the \nguidance of the international consultants to identify the constraints and policy recommendations \nas identified in the outline terms of reference (Appendix 3).  The sector reports will be inputs to \nthe main report prepared by the team leader of the international consultants. All the reports, \nincluding initiating papers, interim reports, and final reports will be reviewed by the Hebei \nprovincial government and ADB staff in the inception, midterm, and finalization workshops. The \ninternational and domestic team leaders will provide quarterly reports to ADB for the progress of \nthe TA study.  \n \n \n ", "  5\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.
