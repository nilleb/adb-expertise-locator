After the high-level forum on the draft State Poverty Reduction Program (SPRP) in April \n2002, the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan (the Government) reiterated its request for \na follow-up technical assistance (TA) to build the capacity of national and local governments to \nreduce poverty. The TA1 was included in the Kazakhstan Country Strategy and Program Update \nfor 2002. An Asian Development Bank (ADB) fact-finding mission was conducted from 28 \nAugust to 13 September 2002, and reached an agreement with the Government on the TA \nobjective, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements. The TA \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since 1999, Kazakhstan has achieved positive and rising gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth rates, from 2.7% in 1999 to 9.8% in 2000 and 13.2% by 2001, resulting in a decline in \npoverty incidence,2 albeit at less than the pace of the GDP growth rate. By 2001, government \nstatistics showed that the poor made up more than one fourth of the total population and that \nthe total unemployed were more than 780,000, or 10.4% of the economically active population. \nWhile poverty incidence may have declined nationally, the headcount poverty index varied \nwidely across oblasts.3 The headcount poverty index ranged from a low of less than 10% in \nAstana City, to 52% in Mangistau. Nonincome poverty indicators showed disturbing trends. \nBased on government statistics, infant and maternal mortality remained high, and tuberculosis \n(TB) incidence was rising. Pavlodar, an industrial oblast, recorded one of the country\u2019s highest \ninfant mortality rates (25 deaths per 1,000 born) and had higher-than-average incidences of \ncancer (246.1 per 100,000 people) and TB (196.2 per 100,000 people). Almaty, an agricultural \noblast, had higher rural poverty than the national average and recorded high rates of infectious \nand parasitic disease.  \n \n3.  The President of Kazakhstan is scheduled to sign the SPRP for 2003\u20132005 as a state \nprogram before the end of the year. The Government is also drafting the 3-year action plan for \nthe SPRP, and the oblasts are finalizing their poverty reduction programs. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) on 30 August 2002. \n2 The Government\u2019s National Statistics Agency (NSA) uses \u201csubsistence minimum\u201d to measure poverty incidence \n(the percentage of the total population whose consumption expenditures fall below the subsistence minimum). The \nsubsistence minimum comprises 70% food items and 30% goods and services, excluding the cost of public utilities. \nIt is derived from the data set of the living standards measurement survey developed for the country with World \nBank assistance in 1996, and was refined and updated by NSA in 2001. Subsistence minimum is differentiated \nfrom the \u201cpoverty line,\u201d which, in Kazakhstan, is determined by law as a fixed percentage of the subsistence \nminimum. The Ministry of Labor and Social Protection establishes the poverty line and uses it to estimate \nbudgetary allocations for social assistance, or cash transfers to poor households. Using the international standard \nof $2.15 a day per capita income (at purchasing power parity standard) as the poverty threshold, the World Bank \nestimated poverty incidence at 5.7% in 1996. Data on poverty incidence using the international poverty line \nyardstick is not updated, but assuming the same downward trend of poverty incidence based on subsistence \nminimum, the headcount poverty level using the international poverty threshold would be roughly 5 %.  \n3  An oblast is an administrative unit equivalent to a region. Kazakhstan has 14 oblasts.  ", "2 \n4.  To track the effectiveness of the SPRP in reducing poverty, 18 outcome indicators have \nbeen identified.4 With the exception of four indicators that gauge direct and indirect interventions \nfor the poor, the rest focus on direct interventions extended to the poor. A third of these 14 \nindicators relate to employment for the poor while the rest served to measure delivery of social \nservices that directly impact on the poor.  \n \n5.  While the SPRP identifies the monitoring indicators, it does not specify the monitoring \nand evaluation (M&E) system that will clearly delineate the roles, functions, and relations of the \nconcerned agencies and local governments in tracking the indicators. At the national level, the \nMinistry of Economy and Budget Planning (MEBP), which serves as the secretariat to the \nInterministerial Committee on Poverty Reduction, oversees and coordinates the M&E of the \nSPRP. However, because of inadequate technical capacity, MEBP has not been able to set up \na  M&E  system  that  will  effectively  relate  the  activities  of  concerned  agencies  and  local \ngovernments.  \n \n6.  While the National Statistics Agency (NSA) compiles most of the impact (or outcome) \nindicators of the poverty reduction programs, the data source for most of the indicators and the \nmain implementers of the direct poverty-related interventions are the Ministry of Labor and \nSocial Protection (MLSP) and the akimats.5 MLSP compiles data on labor and employment, the \nsubsistence minimum and poverty line (footnote 2), and the extremely poor and their key \nfeatures; and implements labor and social assistance programs down to the local levels. MLSP \nhas developed a database management system but lacks the technical skills and equipment to \nlink its local offices and MEBP. MLSP also needs the skills to evaluate and analyze the findings \nfrom its monitoring activities and assess the impact of its direct poverty reduction programs.  \n \n7.  Because of decentralization, the akimats have the budget and authority to plan, manage, \nimplement, and control poverty-related social and economic projects in the akimats\u2019 territorial \njurisdiction. The akimats are also finalizing their SPRPs, which means that delivery of social \nservices to the poor lies essentially in the akimats\u2019 hands. M&E of the SPRPs will be important \nto identify bottlenecks or problems during implementation to solve them as soon as possible, \nand to provide feedback to the central Government on measures to ensure that the countrywide \nSPRP objectives are achieved.  \n \n8.  Aside from M&E system, a feedback mechanism must be developed to keep national \npolicymakers abreast of the status and progress of the poverty reduction strategy, and to \nprovide beneficiaries with a mechanism to register their level of satisfaction on service provision \nand delivery. Government and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) must be involved in M&E \nto  ensure  transparency  in  the  implementation  of  government  poverty  programs  and  exact \naccountability from the providers of these measures.6  \n \n                                                 \n4  The  18  indicators  are  GDP  per  capita,  percentage  of  people  below  minimum  subsistence  level,  level  of \nunemployment, percentage of economically active population employed in small business, number of microcredits \ngiven, number of retrained registered unemployed, number of employed at public works, percentage of people \nwithout access to potable water, percentage of rural families without telephones, number of people receiving \ntargeted social assistance, percentage of people receiving assistance from among the population living below \nsubsistence minimum, coverage of 5\u20136  year olds by preschooling training, TB mortality, TB incidence of TB, infant \nmortality, maternal mortality, and average lifespan of population. \n5  Akimats are local governments. \n6  International  experience  shows  that  undertaking  M&E  and  providing  feedback  mechanisms  for  the  target \nbeneficiaries to register their satisfaction rating ensures immediate response from the Government to problems \narising from the implementation of these activities and reduces income and nonincome poverty. ", "3 \n9.  Finally, the indicators specified in the SPRP generally do not reflect the diverse features \nof poverty at the oblast level and are not able to gauge the akimats\u2019 performance in combating \npoverty.7 The indicators also focus on the final outcomes of the goods and services produced by \ngovernment measures. More effective indicators are those that complement these outcome \nindicators with intermediate indicators or inputs and outputs, and the implementation process; \nand explain or contribute to the results of the outcomes.8 Monitoring indicators disaggregated by \ngeographic or administrative unit and program will also provide policymakers better information \non the causes and sources of success of, or gaps in, the intervention measures, and enable \npolicymakers to timely adjust specific program components.  \n \n10.  The TA will address these concerns by helping the Government pilot-test an oblast-level \nM&E system and a feedback and advocacy mechanism linked to and coordinated by MEBP. \nLinkage of oblast-based M&E offices with one central service-providing agency, MLSP, and \ncoordinated with MEBP, will also be test-cased. The lessons from these experiences will help \nthe central Government design mechanisms in the oblasts and nationwide to improve poverty \nreduction, adjust the SPRP outcome monitoring indicators so that they focus on the key poverty \nissues, and ensure that poverty is eradicated. A summary initial poverty and social analysis of \nthe TA is in Appendix 2.  \n11.  The TA is a follow-through activity of TA 3550-KAZ: Preparation of a Comprehensive \nMedium-Term Poverty Reduction Strategy, which helped the Government formulate the SPRP \nin a participatory manner. The SPRP poverty analysis highlights the need to address regional \ndisparities and involve the akimats in the program. The TA findings will lay the groundwork to \ndevelop the poverty reduction partnership agreement between the Government and ADB. The \nTA will also benefit from a recently approved small-scale TA9 (SSTA). It will undertake a public \nexpenditure review of the education and health sectors at the concerned ministry and two \noblasts from January to April 2003. The SSTA lessons will serve as inputs to the M&E system to \nbe established under the TA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The TA\u2019s purpose is to develop an efficient and transparent SPRP M&E and feedback \nsystem at the national and oblast levels by pilot-testing alternative institutional arrangements \nand capacity building for poverty monitoring, evaluation, and feedback on the Government\u2019s \nperformance in implementing the SPRP. The outputs will include (i) a poverty M&E system, (ii) a \nfeedback and advocacy mechanism to disseminate the findings from the M&E activities, and (iii) \nanalytical  skills  in  monitoring  and  evaluating  government  attainment  of  poverty  reduction \ntargets. \n  \n                                                 \n7 For example, one monitoring indicator is GDP. Oil-rich Manistee and Atyrau, with the highest oblast GDP, registered \nvery high poverty incidence at 52% and 41%, respectively. \n8 One of the SPRP indicators is TB incidence, which continued to rise from 1996 to 2001 despite increases in the \nbudget for TB programs. Key inputs to be monitored are the budget allocated for the TB program and the use and \nallocation of the funds for preventive versus curative measures disaggregated by regions and types of target \nbeneficiaries. \n9 ADB. 2002. Small-Scale Technical Assistance for the Social Sector Expenditure Review in Kazakhstan. Manila.  ", "4 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The M&E and feedback system will be set-up and test-cased in Pavlodar and Almaty, \nwhich  were  selected  in  consultation  with  government  officials  in  central  offices  using  the \nfollowing: (i) economic sector focus\u2014Pavlodar is industrial while Almaty is rural; (ii) income-\ngenerating capacity\u2014Pavlodar is a \u201cdonor\u201d oblast in the sense that part of its local revenues is \nallocated  to  low-income  oblasts,  while  Almaty  is  a  \u201crecipient\u201d  or  a  low-income  oblast;  (iii) \nwillingness and capacity of the akimats to implement the M&E system; and (iv) availability of an \noblast-level SPRP. \n \n14.  In these two oblasts, the monitoring indicators of the national and oblast SPRPs will be \nreviewed, and key input, output, and outcome poverty indicators identified. The appropriate \nmonitoring techniques as well as the evaluation and feedback approaches will be test-cased \nthrough a combination of (i) technical advice on the intermediate indicators for the direct poverty \ninterventions of the akimats and MLSP, database development and management, monitoring \ntracking  systems,  and  process  and  impact  evaluation  techniques;  (ii)  intensive  training  of \ntechnical staff of MEBP and MLSP at the oblast and central offices, and of other local public \nstaff members who will be involved in the M&E and feedback system; and (iii) provision of \nequipment  and  software  to  oblast  and  central  offices  of  MEBP  and  MLSP  for  database \nmanagement and M&E. To encourage NGO involvement in M&E, small-scale surveys and \nstudies assessing the satisfaction level of targeted beneficiaries of poverty interventions will be \nencouraged on a competitive basis. The TA will also help MEBP define its coordination role and \ndevelop the overall supervisory structure of the poverty M&E and feedback system at the central \nlevel.  \n \n15.  The TA outputs will be disseminated through the feedback mechanism, comprising a \nweb site, bulletins, and media conferences.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total TA cost is estimated at $966,000 equivalent, consisting of $422,000 in foreign \nexchange costs and $544,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance $676,000 \nequivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $254,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment will fund the remaining local currency cost of $290,000 equivalent. Government \nfinancing will cover remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff, office accommodation and \nequipment, workshop expenses, translation and interpretation, and transport. Details of the cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MEBP will be the TA Executing Agency while MLSP and the Department of Economy \nand Budget Planning (DEBP) in Pavlodar and Almaty will serve as the implementing agencies \n(IAs),  MEBP  will  set  up  the  poverty  M&E  and  feedback  systems  in  the  two  oblasts,  and \ncoordinate  with  MLSP  to  develop  the  feedback  mechanism  to  the  akimats  and  to  the \nInterministerial  Committee  on  Poverty  Reduction,  the  findings  from  the  evaluation  and \nassessment studies. At the end of the TA, MEBP will ensure that the TA lessons can serve as \nthe basis to institute national and local poverty M&E and feedback system.  \n \n18.  The oblast DEBP, which reports directly to the akimat level and the central MEBP, will \nestablish a poverty monitoring and evaluation group (PMEG) with the economic and social ", "5 \nworking groups, involving the concerned departments at the oblast level. The working groups \nwill set up the M&E and feedback system that will track performance at the oblast level and the \nsocial and economic programs that impact on poverty. The PMEG will review and identify the \nkey input, output, and outcome poverty indicators relevant to the oblasts; set up mechanisms to \nassess in a participatory manner the level of satisfaction of targeted beneficiaries on the poverty \nreduction  programs  in  the  oblasts;  and  develop  a  mechanism  to  provide  feedback  to  the \nakimats, central MEBP, and Interministerial Committee on Poverty Reduction on the monitoring \nindicators and the findings from the evaluation and assessment studies.  \n \n19.  The local MLSP, which reports directly to the central MLSP, will be a member of the \nPMEG and provide it with the income and nonincome information about the poor and extremely \npoor, as well as evaluation assessments of MLSP employment and social assistance programs. \nThis  information  will  be  reported  to  the  akimats,  central  MEBP  and  MLSP,  and  the \nInterministerial Committee on Poverty Reduction to improve their social service delivery.  \n \n20.  The TA will support training, seminars, and workshops of PMEG, MLSP, and MEBP staff \non  the  quantitative  and  qualitative  approaches  to  monitoring  and  evaluating  the  poverty \nreduction activities; advocacy and feedback approaches, and pro-poor budgeting; as well as the \nidentification of the intermediate, output, and outcome indicators. The training, seminars, and \nworkshops will be done by the consultants and resource persons in close coordination with the \nMEBP and ADB. The TA will collaborate with the World Bank Institute and Asian Development \nBank Institute on the training activities. Both institutes are planning poverty-related training. The \nTA  will  also  finance  the  cost  of  small-scale  studies  and  beneficiary  rating  surveys  to  be \nconducted by local NGOs selected on a competitive basis by the ADB. DEBP and MLSP will \nfund surveys that will be used in evaluating the level of efficiency and effectiveness in delivering \nthe poverty reduction activities.   \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 1 year, from January 2003 to January 2004. \nIt  will  finance  42  person-months  of  consulting  services,  comprising  7  person-months  for \ninternational and 35 person-months for domestic consultants. The consultants will help the \nMEBP, MLSP and DEBP set up the poverty M&E and feedback system in the two pilot oblasts, \nMLSP, and MEBP; and provide technical advice and training in M&E approaches. The terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. The consultants will be selected and engaged \nthrough a consulting firm following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The quality- and \ncost-based selection method and simplified technical proposal format will be used. Equipment \nwill be procured by the consultants with procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $676,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan for the Capacity Building of National and Local \nGovernments to Implement the Poverty Reduction Program, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board.  \n ", "6 Appendix  1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets    and Risks \nGoal       \n     \nImprove the Government\u2019s  - Improved efficiency indicators  National and regional \ndelivery of poverty reduction  of the delivery of poverty  surveys on poverty \nmeasures so that it is efficient,  reduction measures    \ntransparent, and accountable,  - Increased participation of  MEBP progress reports on \nthereby reducing income and  stakeholders in the M&E and  SPRP to the Interministerial \nnonincome poverty in  feedback of poverty reduction  Committee on Poverty \nKazakhstan  measures  Reduction \n  - Reduction of income and \nnonincome poverty \nPurpose       \n       \nDevelop an efficient and  - By end-2004:   - ADB review missions  - The Government \ntransparent national and oblast  (i) an M&E system has been     remains highly \nSPRP M&E and feedback  established delineating the  - Technical completion report  committed to the \nsystem by pilot-testing  roles, functions, and relations  SPRP. \nalternative institutional  of concerned agencies and   \narrangements and capacity  local governments in  - Interagency \nbuilding for poverty M&E of  Pavlodar and Almaty oblasts;  coordination is \nand feedback on the   (ii) a feedback mechanism has  effective. \ngovernment\u2019s implementation  been developed that involves \nof the SPRP  stakeholders and results in \n  service delivery reforms; and \n(iii) the Government agrees to a \ncourse of action to implement \nthe M&E and feedback \nsystem at national and oblast \nlevels. \nOutputs       \n       \n1.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national    Sector identified as a national priority in country \npriority in country poverty analysis? Yes  strategy?   \n  No poverty partnership agreement yet \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Kazakhstan: \n \nWhile income poverty has declined in recent years, poverty incidence varies across oblasts. Nonincome \npoverty indicators, as shown by key health and education indicators, have displayed disturbing trends \namong the oblasts.  \n  \nRecognizing these emerging issues, the Government has drafted the State Poverty Reduction Program \n(SPRP), which will be signed before the end of the year. Each oblast has also been tasked to draft a \npoverty reduction program, tailored to the SPRP.  \n  \nThe SPRP has some limitations that may not ensure effective poverty reduction. First, although the SPRP \nhas 18 outcome indicators, it does not specify a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system involving local \ngovernments and service providers despite the fact that 14 of the 18 indicators relate to delivery of social \nservices and other direct poverty reduction interventions. The main providers of these pro-poor social \nservices and measures are the local governments and the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection \n(MLSP). While the Ministry of Economy and Budget Planning (MEBP) has been tasked to coordinate the \nM&E of the measures, it does not have the skills to do so. Second, even if these service delivery units \nwere involved, their staff do not have the technical M&E skills. Third, the indicators focus on final \noutcomes that are general and do not specify the intermediate indicators that monitor implementation. \nFourth, the SPRP does not have a feedback mechanism to convey evaluation assessments to the main \npolicymakers to allow them to act in a timely manner. Targeted beneficiaries must register their level of \nsatisfaction with service delivery. \n  \nThe technical assistance (TA) will develop, on a pilot basis, an M&E and feedback system for SPRP \nimplementation, involving local governments in two oblasts, MLSP, and MEBP, and improve their \ntechnical staff\u2019s capacity. With a more efficient and effective M&E and feedback system, the key central \ngovernment service delivery units will be encouraged to improve their delivery of services to the poor, \nwhich, in turn, will eventually reduce nonincome and income poverty. The TA is envisaged to lead to \ninstitutionalization of an efficient and transparent M&E and feedback system for the SPRP. In the medium \nterm, this will improve delivery of poverty reduction measures and reduce poverty.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis      Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nAs poverty monitoring indicators and technical skills in poverty M&E improve, the poverty analysis will \nfocus on the process of evaluating poverty reduction measures, and its impact on the multidimensional \nfeatures of poverty. The analysis will be disaggregated at the oblast, sector, and poverty group levels, \nand will employ quantitative and qualitative approaches. The feedback system will let the targeted \nbeneficiaries register their level of satisfaction with the Government\u2019s direct poverty interventions and \nallow stakeholders to be involved in M&E of poverty reduction programs.
