THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based  grant,  and  (ii)  a  proposed  project grant,  both to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic for  the \nStrengthening Education System Sector Development Program.1  \n \n2.  The policy-based grant will support key policy reforms to strengthen education in the \nKyrgyz Republic; the project grant will finance investments that directly link to and support the \neffective delivery of those reforms. Complementary policy-based and project components will \naddress education quality, relevance, access, and sector management.2   \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Country context. The Kyrgyz Republic is one of the poorest economies in Central Asia. \nThe country had a per capita gross domestic product of about $990 in 2012, and 38% of the \npopulation  lived  below  the  poverty  line  in  2012.3 The  government\u2019s  National  Sustainable \nDevelopment  Strategy,  launched  in  2013,  acknowledges  the  importance  of  education  in \nsustaining economic growth and reducing poverty. This emphasis on education is reflected in \nincreasing government resources directed to the sector. In 2012, the government\u2019s expenditure \non  education  was  6.9%  of gross  domestic  product.  Actual  expenditure  per  student  is  low \nbecause of the government\u2019s limited fiscal resources. Education is mandatory up to grade 9. \nThe enrollment rate for primary education is 96%, and the transition rate from primary to lower \nsecondary  is  nearly  universal.  The  net  enrollment  rate  is  above  90%  in  lower  secondary \neducation (grades 5\u20139) and 52% in upper secondary education (grades 10\u201311). Many students \nenroll in secondary vocational education institutions after completing grade 9. \n \n4.  Education sector performance. One of the main challenges is improving the quality \nand efficiency of education, particularly addressing low learning outcomes. The Kyrgyz Republic \nranked  last  among  65  countries  that  participated  in  the  Program  of  International  Student \nAchievement by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 2009, \nindicating significant learning gaps among students. For example, the gap in reading literacy \nbetween 15-year-old students in the Kyrgyz Republic and the OECD average corresponded to \n4.5 years of formal schooling. More than half of all students in the Kyrgyz Republic performed \nbelow basic levels in literacy, mathematics, and sciences in the 4th and 8th grade national \nstudent achievement tests.4 Learning outcomes vary depending on location (rural or urban) and \nthe language of instruction.  \n \n5.  Education policy framework. With outdated curricula, a shortage of textbooks, and \nineffective teaching\u2013learning practices, the school environment contributes to poor performance \nin  the  education  sector.  Institutional  contributors  include  system  problems,  fragmented \nresponsibilities  in  managing  education  services,  inefficient  spending,  and  inadequate \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Geneva:  UNICEF  Central  and  Eastern \nEurope/Commonwealth of Independent States. \n ", "2 \nmanagement information systems. In response to these challenges, the Education Development \nStrategy (EDS) for 2012\u20132020 provides an overall approach to strengthen the education system \nand coordinate all government and development partner efforts. The EDS has three pillars: (i) \nimproving  equal  access  to  education  quality,  (ii)  enhancing  the  quality  and  efficiency  of \neducation  services,  and  (iii)  strengthening  sector  management  and  performance.  The \ngovernment  has  implemented  a  number  of  reforms  in  the  education  sector  since  2009, \nincluding: (i) development of the National Framework Curriculum for general education based \non competencies and skills; (ii) approval of subject curricula for grades 1-4; (iii) introduction of \nthe concept of elective education in grades 10-11 to ensure linkages between general education \nand the labor market; (iv) introduction of per capita financing in schools to help ensure a more \nequitable allocation of resources; (v) significant increases in teacher salaries in 2011; and (vi) \nestablishing  school  Boards  of  Trustees  to  participate  in  school  management.  The  MES \ntranslated the EDS for 2012-2020 into specific activities and targets in 3-year action plans, and \nis currently preparing an action plan for 2015-2017. \n \n6.  Competency-based curriculum. As a response to low learning outcomes and weak \nskills  competencies  the  government  has  introduced  comprehensive  reforms,  including  new \ncompetency-based curricula for grades 1\u20134.5 Curricula for grades 5\u20139 are being developed with \nassistance from the World Bank.6 Policy and investment support is essential to complete the \nrevision of the curriculum and learning and teaching materials (LTMs) for grades 10\u201311, and to \nintroduce general and elective tracks in these grades to improve links with the labor market. An \nevaluation of the new curriculum for primary education is needed to assist in the reform of the \nsecondary education curriculum. To facilitate this process, a curriculum review unit should be \nestablished to monitor, periodically assess, and continually improve the curriculum.  \n \n7.  Textbook provision. Textbook shortages, distribution and availability problems, and \noutdated content have had a major impact on learning outcomes. The government\u2019s annual \nbudget of Som100 million is only 40% of the amount required to renew the textbook stocks each \nyear for all grades. In SY2011/12, the Ministry of Education and Science (MES) estimated that \nonly 43% of students had access to textbooks. The provision of textbooks differs significantly \nbetween regions, and many schools continue to use old stocks of obsolete textbooks. Strategies \nto reduce the cost and improve the quality of textbooks are needed to achieve financially \nsustainable  textbook  provision  that  can  support  the  new  curriculum.  The  EDS  2012\u20132020 \nproposes a textbook rental scheme (TRS) to create full and sustainable textbook supplies for all \nstudents, with the government subsidizing the poorest and most vulnerable students (15% of \nstudents will qualify for free rentals). The MES needs to improve the quality and durability of \ntextbooks and LTMs, which have tended to be overly theoretical, reflecting the deficiencies of \nthe curriculum. The current quality assurance processes need upgrading to ensure that high-\nquality textbooks supportive of curriculum objectives will be used. \n \n8.  Teacher  quality.  To  address  declining  education  quality,  the  government  adopted \nteacher salary reforms in 2011, which almost doubled teacher wages and largely alleviated \nteacher shortages. However, teacher levels were eliminated in 2012, resulting in a lack of \ncareer progression. Reforms are necessary to develop, assess, and reward teachers. In the \nEDS 2012\u20132020, the policy priorities include (i) reintroducing teacher certification based on new \nstandards,  (ii)  modernizing  teacher  performance  appraisal  and  continual  professional \ndevelopment, and (iii) enhancing incentives for teachers. Improved chances for promotion and \nother financial incentives will help attract teachers to remote and rural areas, where teacher \n                                                \n5  The Kyrgyz Republic school year starts in September and ends in May. \n6  World Bank. 2013. Sector Support for Education Reform Project. Washington, DC. \n ", "3 \nshortages have remained. The requirements of the new curriculum have created pressure on \nteachers to improve their subject pedagogical competencies; however, the quality of in-service \nteacher training (INSETT) does not meet modern requirements. While every school teacher \nshould undergo INSETT every 5 years, only 10%\u201320% get the opportunity for professional \ndevelopment. INSETT quality and accessibility needs to be improved. \n \n9.  Education  planning  and  delivery. The education budget needs to be reviewed to \nenhance efficiency. About 20% of the annual public expenditure is allocated to education. \nHowever,  more than  70%  of the  education  budget  is  required for  salaries,  leaving  limited \nfinancial  resources  for  quality  improvements.7In  addition,  the  planning  and  management \ncapacity  of  school  principals  is  still  generally  weak.  Better  capacity  building  programs  are \nneeded  for  school  principals,  deputy  principals,  and  district  methodology  specialists.  To \nincrease access to quality education, the government launched a national program in 2013 to \nestablish 100 innovative schools. These schools will (i) serve as cluster schools to enhance \nresource- and capacity-sharing among neighboring schools; (ii) provide well-resourced learning \nsites for science, technology, and math; and (iii) serve as platforms for modern teaching and \nlearning. The innovative schools need regulations and mechanisms for effective operations, \nmodern  multimedia  equipment  and  science  labs,  and  better  teacher  methodological \ncompetencies. The functioning of all school boards of trustees needs to be improved to promote \ntheir involvement in resource allocation and school management. Capital investment and the \noperational budget for primary and secondary education have been inadequate. Underfunding \nof operation and maintenance costs has led to the degradation of school buildings and other \ninfrastructure.  A  study  by  UNICEF  found  that  64%  of  schools  need  major  repairs.8 Thirty \nselected innovative schools in remote and rural areas need to be rehabilitated to improve \nlearning environments. Teachers and principals in the selected innovative schools need support \nto use information and communication technology (ICT) for new approaches to teaching and \nlearning, including multimedia classrooms and pilots for math and science software.  \n \n10.  Sector  development  program  approach  and  previous  ADB  support. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) began providing assistance to the sector in 1997 with the Education \nSector Development Program (ESDP).9 The ESDP helped to rationalize the education system, \nimproved efficiency and management capabilities, and upgraded education content. Under the \nSecond Education Project, ADB supported initiatives in INSETT, developing curriculum and \nstate education standards, enhancing education management and planning, and rehabilitating \nselected schools to improve learning environments.10 ADB support to the education sector also \nincluded the Improving Access to Quality Basic Education for Children with Special Needs \nProject, supported by a grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction,11 and two projects to \nsupport vocational and technical education and training.12 The proposed sector development \n                                                \n7  Sector Assessment (Summary): Education (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  UNICEF. 2013.

The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 15). \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  For policy-based grant: June 2013\u2013May 2018 \nFor project: February 2015\u2013February 2021 \nEstimated completion date  For policy-based grant: May 2018 \nFor project: February 2021; project grant closing date: August 2021 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Sector-wide steering committee  \nVice prime minister (chair) \nRepresentatives from MOF and MES (members) \n(ii)   Executing agency  MES \n(iii)  Implementation unit  Joint PIU, MES, 7 staff \nMOF will operate the imprest account \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  2 contracts  $1,840,000 \nNational competitive bidding  5 contracts  $2,960,000 \nShopping  2 contracts  $60,000 \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  2 contracts  $1,516,300 \nConsultants\u2019 qualifications selection  2 contracts   $450,000 \nIndividual consultant selection  3 contracts  $363,000 \nQuality-based selection  1 contract  $660,000 \nLeast-cost selection  1 contract   $80,000 \nRetroactive financing  Advance contracting has been requested to recruit the PIU staff, the international TRS \nand/or advance  expert, and the education development consulting firm.

The proceeds of the \npolicy-based grant will be disbursed to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic as the \nrecipient in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. The $10 million policy-\nbased grant will be disbursed in two tranches once relevant conditions have been met \nby the government:  \nTranche 1: $3 million (planned for 2015)  \nTranche 2: $7 million (planned for 2017) \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MES = Ministry of Education and Science, MOF = Ministry of Finance, PIU = \nproject implementation unit, TRS = textbook rental scheme.  \na The government has been advised that approval of advance contracting will not commit ADB to subsequently \napprove financing for the project. \nb  ADB. 1998.

DUE DILIGENCE  \nA.  Technical \n20.  The  program  builds  on  the  achievements  made  under  the  ADB-funded  ESDP  and \nSecond Education Project. It incorporates the following lessons from the completion reports for \n ", "8 \nthe ESDP17 and Second Education Project:18 (i) ensure continuity of support for curriculum \ndevelopment; (ii) improve textbook provision; (iii) carry out reforms in INSETT; (iv) improve \nschool facilities to enhance learning environments; (v) establish a dedicated unit to monitor, \nperiodically assess, and continually improve the curriculum; and (vi) use the sector development \nprogram modality to promote the sustainability of reforms. Technical due diligence analysis \nfound no discernable risk in having minor civil works in schools. The program will provide policy \nrecommendations to support the sustainable operation and maintenance of school facilities. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  Economic  and  financial  analyses  were  prepared.  The  economic  benefits  from  the \nprogram  include  improved  quality  of  education  resulting  in  a  higher  wage  premium  for \nsecondary school completers (relative to non-completers) and decreased wastage of public and \nprivate resources as a result of reduced dropouts and repetitions. Estimating these benefits over \n20  years  yields  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  23.8%,  as  shown  in  the  economic \nanalysis.19 A financial sustainability analysis was undertaken during program preparation based \non the fiscal impact of measures necessary to achieve high-quality education, including textbook \nprovision, enhanced teacher training, and school maintenance.20 Excluding the effect of the TRS, \nresulting recurrent costs increase as a percentage of the total MES budget initially, peaking at \n2.1% of the education budget in 2021 and falling to 1.2% in 2030. If the TRS is implemented as \nplanned, recurrent costs increase to 1.3% in 2021 and fall to 0.6% in 2030 because the TRS \nrevenues are expected to reduce the government contribution to textbook funding to 15% of the \ntotal cost.  Therefore, incremental cost burdens are sustainable, assuming (i) continued support \nfrom development partners in the period to 2020, (ii) the economy grows as the International \nMonetary  Fund  predicts,  and  (iii)  the  government  budget  plans  and  fiscal  reforms  are \nimplemented. Prospects for sustainability are significantly improved if the MES cost burden is \nlightened by a carefully designed TRS and other cost-reduction measures that the program will \nhelp to identify and implement.  \n \nC.  Governance \n22.  Financial management and procurement capacity assessments have been carried out in \naccordance with ADB requirements. The overall pre-mitigation financial management risk is \nassessed as high. Weaknesses include staffing capacity, financial planning and budgeting, \ninternal  audit,  procurement,  and  knowledge  of  ADB  requirements.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic\u2019s \ndevelopment partners are supporting strengthening the budgeting, financial management, and \nbasic fiduciary arrangements within the MES, including internal audit.21 The MES also adopted \nan anticorruption action plan in 2014. Assessment findings have been incorporated into the \nprogram design as appropriate, and the MES is addressing others with development partner \nsupport. The Ministry of Finance, with ADB support, is establishing a centralized electronic \nprocurement platform to help limit corruption.22 Under the proposed program, the MES will pilot \nelectronic tendering of textbooks to improve procurement transparency and  efficiency. The \nprogram includes strengthening PIU staff and training MES and PIU staff in ADB procedures, \nincluding  procurement,  disbursement,  and  accounting  systems.

Manila. \n \n ", "9 \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the Ministry of Finance \nand the MES. A single integrated grievance redress mechanism with multiple access points and \nmultiple tracks will be set up and managed by the joint PIU.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n23.  Improving education attainment and quality plays a key role in reducing poverty and \nimproving living standards in the Kyrgyz Republic. The 30 innovative schools to be supported \nwill be selected based on poverty and other social needs criteria in each location.23 The TRS will \nprovide free textbook rentals to the 15% of students who are the most poor and vulnerable. \nUnder the program, textbook production and provision will be demographically balanced and will \nreflect government policies on languages of instruction.  \n \n24.  The program is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming and a gender action plan \nhas been prepared. Gender analysis of students shows gender parity in school enrollment. The \naverage number of years of schooling among females 15\u201319 years old (10.05) is slightly higher \nthan for males (9.89).24 The Program of International Student Achievement 2009 results also \nshowed girls slightly outperforming boys in reading, math, and science. The achievement gaps \nfor boys could curtail their access to tertiary education, if left unattended. About 80% of the \nteachers in secondary education are women, and most school principals are also women. The \ngender action plan includes the following targets and gender-responsive design features: (i) \nremoval of gender bias in the curriculum, textbooks, and LTMs, and promotion of positive \nimages of women in higher-status occupations; (ii) increasing the number of male teachers; (iii) \nmore appropriately trained female administrators; and (iv) gender monitoring and evaluation \nindicators integrated in the overall design and monitoring framework to track the implementation \nof the gender action plan.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n25.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified \nas category C for environmental impact. Output 3 under the project grant will include minor civil \nworks, such as rehabilitation of the 30 innovative schools. Civil works activities with more than \nminimal environmental impacts, such as clearance of large areas of vegetation, will be excluded \nfrom financing. Overall, the limited impacts from rehabilitation works will be localized and short \nterm, and can be effectively mitigated through good civil works practices. An environmental \nscreening and management checklist has been prepared and is included in the PAM. The \ninvoluntary resettlement category is C. Project activities will not require land acquisition or \nresettlement. The indigenous peoples category is C. No program activities will adversely affect \nethnic minorities. Higher-quality education as a result of the program will benefit all students, \nincluding ethnic minorities. At least three of the 30 innovative schools to be supported by ADB \nare expected to have classes with an ethnic minority language of instruction. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n26.  During  program  design,  governance  and  implementation  risks  were  assessed  and \nmitigating measures incorporated. These are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan.25 Since the MES budgets are not clearly linked to policy goals, performance \nindicators,  or  nonfinancial  outcomes,  performance  is  difficult  to  gauge.  However,  with \ndevelopment partner support, the government is working to improve budgeting and financial \n                                                \n23  Summary of Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n ", "10 \nmanagement. The risks that are considered high are (i) the effects on the education sector of \ngovernment fiscal policies to reduce budget deficits, which will be mitigated through assurances \nfrom the government on maintaining existing levels of education expenditure and measures to \nimprove the efficiency of education spending; (ii) poor functioning of the procurement market, \nwhich will be mitigated through the design of the procurement plan and activities within the \nprogram to pilot test electronic procurement of textbooks; (iii) unstable political, economic, and \nsocial conditions\u2014a risk largely outside ADB control, but the program\u2019s goal of creating quality \neducation services will help mitigate the risk; (iv) a slower pace for policy reforms, especially \nduring the pre-election period, which will be mitigated through the disbursement conditions for \nthe  policy-based  grant  and  through  a  continuing  process  of  policy  dialogue;  (v)  a  lack  of \nadequate  management  information  systems  in  the  MES,  raising  concerns  about  sector \nperformance  management,  which  will  be  mitigated  through  a  United  Nations  Educational, \nScientific and Cultural Organization initiative and the proposed program\u2019s project performance \nmonitoring system; and (vi) adverse public perception of paying rental fees for textbooks under \nthe TRS, which will be mitigated by an advocacy and communications strategy to help highlight \nthe TRS benefits to the public and measures to ensure the poorest will continue to have free \ntextbooks. The overall risk level to the successful implementation of the program, taking into \naccount  these  mitigation  measures,  is  assessed  as  medium,  with  integrated  benefits \noutweighing risk-associated costs.     \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n27.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM \nand grant documents. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nprogram, which are set forth in the grant agreements.    \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n28.  I am satisfied that the proposed grants would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n  \n(i)  the policy-based grant not exceeding $10,000,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic from \nADB's Special Funds resources for the Strengthening Education System Sector \nDevelopment  Program,  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the \nBoard; and  \n(ii)  the project grant not exceeding $12,000,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic from ADB's \nSpecial  Funds  resources  for  the  Strengthening  Education  System  Sector \nDevelopment  Project,  on  terms  and  conditions  that  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \n     President \n8 September 2014 \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK   \nData Sources \nPerformance Targets and Indicators with  and Reporting \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved human  By 2026, 25% increase in the average  Report on the  The government continues \nresources  score of school graduates on the single  single national  to prioritize enhancing the \ndevelopment for  national graduation test from 125  graduation test  quality and relevance of the \ncompetitiveness of  (maximum score: 250) in 2013    education services  \nthe Kyrgyz       \nRepublic  By 2026, 10% increase in the average  Results of    \nmath score of students in OECD \u2018s PISA  OECD\u2019s PISA \n(baseline: average math score of 331 in   \nPISA 2009) \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nEnhanced quality,  By 2021, 10% increase in the average  Results of the  The government\u2019s education \naccess, and  math (baseline: 527.6 in 2009) and natural  national sample- development strategy, 2012\u2013 \nefficiency of public  sciences (baseline: 497.9 in 2009) scores  based student  2020 is implemented as \neducation in the  of grade 8 students on the national  achievement test  planned  \nKyrgyz Republic  sample-based student achievement test     \n  (baseline: average math score of 508.1 for     \n  rural students and 577.6 for urban   \nstudents; and average sciences score of  Annual MES \n483.9 for rural students and 540.2 for  reports  \nurban students in 2009)   \n \nStudent transition from lower to upper  National Statistics \nsecondary education increased from  Committee \n59.4% in 2011 to 65.0% in 2021  reports  \n \nTextbook provision increased from 43% in \n2011 to 80% in 2021 \nOutputs  Subject curriculum for general and  MES project  Assumptions \n1.
