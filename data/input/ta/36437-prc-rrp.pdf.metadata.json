An  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  was \nAssessment  undertaken.  The  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  was \ncirculated to the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and uploaded on the ADB website on 1 June 2007. \n   \nProject Description  The Project will demonstrate an innovative integrated ecosystem and \nwater resources management approach to improve the environmental \nconditions in Baiyangdian Basin. It will focus on the critical needs to \nconserve  Baiyangdian  Lake\u2014one  of  the  most  important  and \nvulnerable ecosystems in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The \nProject  also  fits  well  with  an  umbrella  program  for  biodiversity \nconservation currently being formulated by the PRC. The infrastructure \ninterventions of the Project are designed primarily to improve waste \nmanagement, reduce water and air pollution, provide clean energy, \nand improve the reliability of water supplies for communities in the \nbasin,  while  the  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  component  will \ncomplement these improvements by raising awareness and promoting \nthe  involvement  of  local  communities  in  management  of  natural \nresources.  \n \nProject activities are aimed at promoting sustainable ecosystem and \nwater  resources  management  with  emphasis  on  biodiversity \nconservation, urban development, and rural livelihood programs. The \nProject  comprises  four  components:  (i)  subproject  investments\u2014\n22 subprojects of seven different categories (13 wastewater treatment \nplants (WTPs); 3 water supply systems (WSSs); 2 reforestation; and \none  each  for  urban  flood  management  [UFM],  integrated  water \nmanagement  [IWM],  solid  waste  management  [SWM]),  and  clean \nenergy development [CED]; (ii) biodiversity conservation to support the \nproposed  GEF-financed  activities;  (iii)  institutional  strengthening \nthrough a range of activities; and (iv) project management support. \n \nThe Project will also promote integrated mechanisms to strengthen \ncoordination  among  line  agencies  that  have  management \nresponsibilities in the basin.  \n   \n ", "ii \nRationale  The Project complements the initiatives of the Baiyangdian Ecosystem \nRehabilitation Master Plan (2005\u20132015), which calls for an integrated \neffort to reduce pollution loads into Baiyangdian Lake and rehabilitate \nthe ecosystem of the basin. As part of the first phase of the Plan, the \nProject will have a demonstration effect for future undertakings and will \nenable  Baoding  municipal  government  (BMG)  achieve,  in  part,  its \nwastewater  management  objectives  set  for  2010,  which  include \nattaining class III water quality in Baiyangdian Lake and class IV water \nquality  in  urban  inland  rivers.  The  Project  will  also  support  the \n11th Five-Year  Plan  (FYP),  2006\u20132010,  which  includes  building  a \n\u201cresource-efficient  and environment-friendly  society.\u201d  As  part  of  the \n11th  FYP,  the  IWM  (Wangkuai-Xidayang  Reservoir  link-canal) \nsubproject will ensure adequate water supply to maintain the desired \nwater level in the lake and replenish the aquifer at Yimuquan, a major \ngroundwater  supply  source  for  Baoding  City.  The  Project  will  also \ncontribute  to  the  achievement  of  Baoding\u2019s  11th  Five-Year \nEnvironmental Protection Plan, which involves a series of pollution \ncontrol  and  ecological  rehabilitation  programs  and  includes \ncomprehensive rehabilitation of Baiyangdian Lake Wetland Provincial \nNature  Reserve;  and  the  comprehensive  cleanup  of  Huanghuagou \nRiver dumps that contain solid waste, fly ash, and industrial waste. The \nProject  will  also  further  the  objective  of  the  China  Biodiversity \nPartnership  Framework,  currently  being  formulated  by  the  United \nNations  Development  Programme  with  support  from  GEF.  The \nFramework calls for containing biodiversity loss in nature reserves and \nmainstreaming biodiversity conservation while pursuing socioeconomic \ndevelopment.  The  proposed  Project  also  supports  ADB\u2019s  strategic \npriorities that also call for promoting sustainable ecosystem and water \nresources management, with emphasis on biodiversity conservation.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  the  proposed  Project  is  improved  quality  of  life,  a \nsustainable ecosystem, and biodiversity conservation in Baiyangdian \nBasin. The outcome is integrated ecosystem and water management, \nand improved environmental conditions in Baiyangdian Basin. \n   \nProject Investment  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at about $273.4 million \nPlan   equivalent, including taxes and duties of $12.6 million and provisions \nfor  physical  and  price  contingencies,  interest  during  construction, \ncommitment fee, and spread over an implementation period of 5 years. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $100,000,000 from the ordinary capital resources of ADB will \nbe  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% \nper annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the Loan \nAgreement. The proposed GEF grant of $2,975,000 will meet part of \nthe  cost  of  biodiversity  conservation  and  institutional  strengthening  \ncomponents. \n  \n ", "iii \nTotal \nSource  % \n($ million) \nAsian Development Bank  100.0  36.6\nGlobal Environment Facility  3.0  1.1\nPRC Government  32.0  11.7\nBaoding Municipal Government  25.8  9.4\nBaoding New Hi-Tech Zone Administrative    46.6  17.0\n     Commission \nCounty Governments  50.1  18.3\nChina Construction Bank  4.6  1.7\nAsian Pacific Carbon Fund  1.8  0.7\nEquity Investments  9.5  3.5\n       Total  273.4  100.0\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nAllocation and  The Borrower will be the PRC, which will relend the proceeds of the \nRelending Terms  ADB loan to Hebei provincial government which, in turn, will onlend the \nloan proceeds to BMG for further onlending to the city/township/county \ngovernments.  The  city/township/county  governments,  commission, \nautonomous zone will then onlend to the implementing agencies (IAs) \non the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 March 2014 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 September 2013  \nCompletion Date   \n   \nImplementation  The 22 subprojects will be implemented in 13 different counties by \nArrangements  24 IAs.  BMG,  acting  through  Baoding  Development  and  Reform \nCommission (BDRC), will be the Executing Agency of the Project. \nBDRC has set up a central project management office (PMO) with 15 \nstaff to implement the Project. A full-time project director has been \nappointed to head the PMO. The key PMO staff have expertise in \nfinancial  management;  civil  and  mechanical  engineering;  water \nresources, environmental, ecosystem, and project management; social \ndevelopment;  and  forestry.  Each  county  will  set  up  a  project \nimplementation unit (PIU) at their respective financial bureaus. PIUs \nwill be headed by project coordinators, who will be the focal point for \nall project-related activities with the PMO. To coordinate the project \nactivities among line bureaus and IAs, BDRC will set up a project \nLeading  Group  that  will  meet  quarterly  in  the  first  2  years  and \nsemiannually thereafter. \n   \nExecuting Agency  BMG, acting through BDRC  \n   \nProcurement  All procurement of goods and works shall be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).

Contracts for goods and works \nestimated to cost $100,000 or less shall be procured using shopping \nprocedures and those for less than $10,000 through direct contracting. \nThe  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) will be included in all procurement documents and \ncontracts. \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will finance two consulting packages. Package A, for 236 \nperson-months,  financed  under  the  loan,  will  comprise  three \ninternational experts for 25 person-months and 14 national experts for \n211 person-months. A consulting firm will be engaged to provide these \nservices.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  the  selection,  contract \nnegotiations, and contract management. Package B, for 180 person-\nmonths,  financed  under  the  GEF  grant,  will  comprise  eight \ninternational experts for 38 person-months and nine national experts \nfor  142  person-months.  ADB  will  recruit  the  firm  and  PMO  will \nnegotiate and manage the contract. In selecting these firms, the quality \nand cost-based selection (80:20) will be used and the shortlisted firms \nwill be required to submit full technical proposals for contract budgets \nof  more  than  $1.0  million.  All  recruitment  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time). \n   \nProject Benefits and  WTPs  and  WSSs  will  benefit  about  1.12  million  people  (or  over \nBeneficiaries  416,000 households) out of a total of about 6.65 million people living \nwithin the wastewater drainage area. Improvement in water supply will \nreduce  the  incidence  of  stomach  and  intestinal  diseases  for  over \n260,000  people.  About  10,000  hectares  (ha)  of  farmland  will  be \nprotected from soil erosion, particularly during the rainy months, with \nthe reforestation of Angezhuang Reservoir area. This will benefit a \ntotal of about 18,750 farm households and will prevent an annual loss \nin  crop  damage  of  about  $2.2  million.  At  full  development  of  the \nBaiyangdian lakeside reforestation subproject, a significant increase in \ntourist activity will generate about $585,000 annually. Rehabilitation of \nHuanghuagou  River  will  reduce  dust  pollution  by  about \n136,000 tons/year, and prevent further contamination of surface and \nsubterranean  water  with  a  positive  impact  on  the  health  of  about \n500,000 people in Baoding City. Health benefits will also be derived \nfrom  the  transfer  of  water  resources  for  about  700,000  people  in \nBaoding City and Li County. The UFM subproject in Anxin County will \nprotect public and private property from flood damage. The incidence \nof respiratory diseases will be reduced by about 20% among the target \npopulation (about 240,000 people) who will benefit from the shift from \ncoal to geothermal energy for space heating. The CED subproject is \nenvisioned to save about 60,000 tons of coal annually and result in \nreduced incidence of sulfur dioxide (SO , about 1,000 tons/year) and \n2\ntotal  suspended  particles  (TSP,  about  500 tons/year)  emissions. \nBiodiversity conservation benefits will accrue through restored habitats \nand protection for wild plants and animals including 192 bird species, ", "v \nof  which  at  least  seven  are  of  global  significance.  All  19  of  the \n22 revenue-generating subprojects are financially viable, with financial \ninvestment rates of return of 7.6\u201315.9%. The economic internal rate of \nreturn of the subprojects is 14.5\u201323.6% and for the whole Project is \n16.9%, indicating that the project investments are viable and robust. \n   \nRisks and  The Project will adopt an integrated approach to address ecosystem \nAssumptions   and water resources issues, and for the planning and implementation \nof project activities. Line bureaus and counties in Baoding Municipality \ndo not often coordinate their operations. In the past, economic growth \nhas taken priority over environmental management. The frequency of \ndrought years has also been on the rise over the past two decades \nand  climate  change  may  further  reduce  water  availability.  If  the \nconstraints  underlying  these  risks  are  not  addressed,  the  project \ninvestments may not achieve the intended impact. These risks can be \nmitigated in part by project interventions, i.e., (i) inculcating integrated \nplanning,  monitoring,  and  enforcing  appropriate  policies  and \nregulations;  and  (ii) building  staff  capacity  and  strengthening \ninstitutions.  Other  risks  include  (i)  lack  of  understanding  of  ADB \npolicies  and  procedures,  (ii) changes  in  PMO  staff,  (iii)  lengthy \nprocurement  decision  making,  and  (iv)  procurement  fraud  and \ncorruption. To mitigate these risks, the Project will provide technical \nand management advisory support and training, particularly during the \nfirst 2 years of implementation. Delays in subproject completion can \nalso  jeopardize  project  investments.  Implementation  of  the  IWM \nsubproject needs to be carefully monitored so that it is completed \nbefore the Government\u2019s South-North Water Transfer Project takes \nover the Sha Aqueduct. The Government realizes the importance of \nwater  supply  to  the  lake  and  will  ensure  its  uninterrupted  flow  by \ncoordinating the implementation of both undertakings. \n \nThe variety in project investments will limit its financial and economic \nrisks. The water treatment, supply, and infrastructure investments will \nuse established technologies and designs. Similarly, the reforestation \nsubprojects will use indigenous species and modern techniques. The \nbiodiversity conservation activities have been designed and will be \nimplemented in close consultation with local communities. Therefore, \nthe overall project risk is low. \n ", " \n \n ", "vii \n \n ", "viii \n ", "ix \n \n ", "x \n ", "xi \n \n ", "xii ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); and (ii) a proposed administration of a grant from \nthe Global Environment Facility (GEF), both for the Integrated Ecosystem and Water Resources \nManagement in the Baiyangdian Basin Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  In  August  2005,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) to help Baoding municipal government (BMG) to formulate the \nProject.1 The PPTA was cofinanced by GEF. This report is based on the analysis of the PPTA, \nfeasibility studies of the Government, findings of ADB missions, and discussions with officials \nand stakeholders. The project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1 and problem \ntree analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n3.  The  PRC  has  achieved  an  unprecedented  rate  of  economic  growth  over  the  last \n20 years. One of the unintended consequences is severe degradation of the environment, \nespecially the pollution of water bodies. The Government\u2019s plans to contain water pollution have \nnot kept pace with the rate of agricultural, industrial, and urban growth. During the 10th Five-\nYear Plan (FYP), 2001\u20132005, environmental management was unsatisfactory\u2014eight of the \n20 environmental targets remained unattained. In particular, emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO ) \n2\nexperienced a rebound, with an increase of 28% against the planned target of a 10% reduction, \nand a decrease of only 2% in the discharge of chemical oxygen demand (COD), compared with \nthe planned 10% reduction. Treated sewage envisaged under the 10th FYP fell short of the \ntarget of 45% by about 8%. Only about 60% of the targets for pollution control for the major \nrivers  and  lakes  were  accomplished.  Furthermore,  aside  from  a  number  of  high-profile \nenvironmental accidents\u2014including the large-scale chemical spill in Songhua River Basin in \n2005\u2014the trend in ecological degradation persisted. Several factors contributed to the poor \nenvironmental  performance  during  the  10th  FYP.  Among  the  most  significant  were: \n(i) inadequate  attention  of  local  governments  to  environmental  protection,  (ii)  overheated \neconomy with low resource-use efficiency, (iii) weak regulatory supervision and enforcement, \n(iv) weak cross-sectoral coordination, and (v) ineffective financing mechanisms. \n \n4.  Under  the  11th  FYP,  2006\u20132010,  the  Government  has  given  priority  to  several \nenvironmental and natural resource concerns which include (i) land degradation, (ii) water \nshortage  and  pollution,  (iii)  air  pollution,  (iv)  poor  urban  environmental  infrastructure, \n(v) degradation  of  the  rural  environment,  (vi)  increasing  frequency  and  intensity  of \nenvironmental accidents, and (vii) global environmental issues such as climate change and \ngreenhouse gas emissions. The Chinese Communist Party and the State Council issued a \nseries of policy directives on environmental protection for the 11th FYP period. These policy \ndirections are incorporated into the National Economic and Social Development Master Plan of \nMarch 2006. This Plan gives priority to (i) protection and rehabilitation of valued ecosystems, \n(ii) increasing  efforts  in  pollution  control,  (iii)  improving  natural  resource  management,  and \n(iv) sustainable utilization of marine and water resources. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Ecosystem Development and \nEnvironmental Protection of Baiyangdian Lake Catchment. Manila. (This project was cofinanced by the GEF\u2019s \nproject preparatory grant, which was approved in March 2007). \n ", "2 \n5.  As a guiding policy for the 11th FYP, the State Council Directive sets forth two broad \nenvironmental objectives for the next 5\u201315 years. By 2010, the environment of key regions and \ncities will be improved, and the trend of ecological degradation will be arrested. By 2020, the \nquality  of  the  environment  and  the  state  of  the  country\u2019s  ecosystems  will  have  improved \nsignificantly. There are many other specific targets set under the 11th FYP but the reduction in \nenergy intensity by 20% and total pollution loading by 10% are the two most prominent. \n \n6.  The PRC is committed to the principles of the Millennium Declaration and its Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) set by the United Nations.2 Among the goals set under the MDGs, \nthe PRC has been successful in providing the urban population with access to safe drinking \nwater but progress in rural areas has been slow. Consequently, a large portion of the rural \npopulation still suffers from diseases caused by poor drinking water and inadequate sanitation \nfacilities, i.e., wastewater treatment plants (WTPs), water supply systems (WSSs), and public \ntoilets. Consistent with the MDGs, the PRC continues to demonstrate its resolve in checking \nenvironmental  deterioration.  Expenditure  on  environmental  protection  has  continued  to \nincrease,  and  a  considerable  body  of  environmental  laws  and  regulations  has  been \npromulgated. Following the 1992 United Nations Rio Summit, the PRC formulated the National \nAgenda 21. Many provinces and cities have since formulated their own environmental protection \nstrategies.  The  new  Western  Development  Strategy,  adopted  in  1999,  also  emphasizes \nenvironmental protection. The PRC is party to several important international conventions. New \npolicies and environmental protection plans for the next 5-year planning period call for building a \n\u201cresource-efficient and environment-friendly society\u201d. Through these efforts, the Government \nexpects to succeed in reversing environmental degradation in the long run. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n7.  Baoding Municipality\u2014which covers about 85% of 31,500 square kilometers (km2) of the \nBaiyangdian Basin and where Baiyangdian Lake is located\u2014lies in the central part of Hebei \nProvince  (Map  1).3  Baoding  City  is  125  kilometers  (km)  from  the  provincial  capital  of \nShijiazhuang in the south and 140 km from Beijing in the north. Baoding Municipality has a \ntypical monsoon climate, with annual average precipitation of 570 millimeters and an annual \nmean temperature of around 12oC. The lake is the largest remaining semi-closed freshwater \nbody in the northern PRC. It lies in the middle reaches of Daqing River Basin4 and ultimately \ndischarges in Bohai Gulf, Yellow Sea. All of the lake body is located in Anxin and Xiong counties \nof Baoding Municipality. The lake has a surface area of 366 km2 and consists of a series of \nnatural low-lying depressions and reed marshes. There are four large-scale reservoirs upstream \nof the lake, including Angezhuang, Longmen, Wangkuai, and Xidayang. From south to north, \neight rivers\u2014Baigou, Cao, Fu, Ping, Pu, Sha (Zhulong), Tang, and Xiaoyi\u2014flow into the lake. \n                                                 \n2  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 2005. UNDP Support China in Building All-Around Xiao Kang \nSociety. The goals are: (i) eradicating extreme poverty and hunger; (ii) achieving universal primary education; \n(iii) promoting gender equality and empowerment of women; (iv) reducing child mortality; (v) improving maternal \nhealth; (vi) controlling HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases; (vii) attaining environmental sustainability; and \n(viii) strengthening global partnership for development.    \n3  Baoding is the third largest municipality in Hebei Province, with a total area of 22,112 km2 and a total population of \nabout 10.9 million, including about 1 million in urban areas. The municipality comprises 22 counties and 4 urban \ndistricts. Total gross domestic product of the municipality in 2005 was $14.0 billion or an increase of 14% over the \nprevious year. Its growth rate during the 10th FYP, 2001\u20132005, averaged 11% per annum, with industrial as the \nlead sector, followed by services and agricultural sectors. \n4 Daiqing River Basin is one of nine main river systems within Hai River Basin. It has a total area of 43,065 km2, \nmostly comprising Hebei Province, a small portion of Shanxi Province, and portions of Beijing and Tianjin \nmunicipalities. The basin is divided into three major geographic regions: (i) Taihang Shan, mountains from 500\u2013\n2,286 meters altitude, consisting of the western 40% of the basin; (ii) a low hill transition zone of less than \n500 meters altitude, covering 10% of the basin; and (iii) the lowland plains occupying 50% of the basin\u2019s land area. \n ", "3 \n8.  The  lake  and  its  upper  watershed  in  the  Taihang  mountains  support  significant \nbiodiversity of regional and global significance within Daqing River Basin. The open water and \naquatic beds of the lake are spawning grounds and feeding habitats for a diverse array of fish \nand other animal species, during the spring and autumn seasons, including up to 192 bird \nspecies. The lake is also an important refueling site for migratory birds on the East Asian\u2013\nAustralasian flyway. Seven globally-threatened bird species are regularly sighted in the area. \nDuring the peak migration season (south\u2013north in May and north\u2013south in September), more \nthan 100,000 ducks transit through the lake. The Taihang mountains, which contain most of the \nlast remaining natural forests in Baoding Municipality, support a wide range of rare and endemic \nanimals such as the brown-eared pheasant (Crossoptilon mantchuricum), grey-sided thrush \n(Turdus feae), leopard (Panthera pardus), and golden takin (Budorcas taxicolor). The Taihang \nmountains are also recognized as the center of plant endemism in the PRC. \n \n9.   Historically,  the  lake  served  many  environmental  and  economic  services  and  was \ndescribed as the \u201ckidney\u201d of the northern PRC. Because of its strategic position as a sink in \nDaqing River basin, it is a critical floodwater retention catchment of rainfall water inflows and \nsurface  runoffs  for  about  72%  of  the  basin\u2019s  area.  Specifically,  it  regulates  floodwater \ndischarges and water levels, and subsequently moderates waterlogging. It is likewise a pathway \nfor the transport of substances, especially nutrients that help contribute to the purification of \nwater and the regeneration of nutrients. The lake has been an economically important source of \nfreshwater fish and reed production (at one time, 60% of all reed harvested in the PRC) as well \nas a source for drinking water and irrigation. It serves as a means for transport and one of the \nmain recreation sites for local tourists in the northern PRC, particularly residents from key cities \nlike Beijing and Tianjin.5 As a large body of water, the lake also moderates local and regional \ntemperatures and therefore has an effect on the microclimate of its surroundings. The lake also \nhas economic importance, especially for more than 200,000 people living within its wetlands \nand  peripheral  zones,  as  the  lake  resources  provide  them  with  (i)  livelihood  opportunities \n(i.e., freshwater fishery, reed production, and tourism-related jobs and businesses); (ii) water for \ndrinking and irrigation; and (iii) major transportation routes. \n \n10.  In the last 4 decades, the functions and values of the basin as well as the lake have \nbeen eroded, with adverse impacts on its ecosystem. Construction of large reservoirs in the \nupstream has led to a dramatic decline in water inflows and surface runoffs into the lake, from \nan average of 1.73 billion cubic meters (m3) of water discharging into the lake in the 1960s down \nto 0.065 billion m3 in 2002. Sediment load had also decreased from 7.1 billion m3 in the 1960s to \njust 1.0 billion m3 by 1999. With the demand for water exceeding supply in Daqing River Basin, \nthe frequencies of \u201cno\u201d or \u201clow\u201d inflows to the lake have become more acute, especially during \ndry years, thus contributing to more incidences of low water levels in the lake. Over the last \nfour decades, the size of the lake has decreased by almost half because of controlled water \nflows, continuous droughts, and soil erosion. Moreover, rising population, expanded agricultural \nand industrial activities, with limited solid and wastewater disposal measures in the upstream \nand within the lake area, have transformed the lake into a major depository of wastewater \ndischarges,  pollutant  substances,  and  sediments.  It  is  estimated  that  half  of  the  pollution \noriginates from the upstream, while the other half emanates from the population of more than \n200,000 living in the lake\u2019s wetlands and surrounding areas. In addition, disturbances in the \nupper watersheds through indiscriminate logging, mining and quarrying, and conversion of \nforests and wetlands to agricultural/industrial sites, have contributed to massive soil erosion and \nland degradation. These, in turn, have caused excessive water obstruction along the tributaries \nthat feed into the lake. \n \n                                                 \n5  The number of domestic tourists visiting the lake and surrounding areas is about 1.5 million per year. \n ", "4 \n11.  Eutrophication  of  the  lake,  caused  by  increasing  pollution,  has  become  a  serious \nproblem\u2014with water quality deteriorating from class III to classes IV and V over the past \n4 decades.6 Therefore, the ecosystem in the lake is constantly at risk. Aside from the regular \noccurrence of fish-kills each year, there has been a drastic loss in biodiversity as the habitat of \nbiotic communities, especially those in the wetland-littoral zones, have reduced drastically. \nCurrently, there are only 47 water plant, 54 fish, 192 bird, and 14 wild mammal species living in \nthe  lake.7  Livelihoods  of  people  who  depend  on  the  lake\u2019s  resources  have  likewise  been \nadversely affected. Moreover, the presence of heavy metals, toxins, and chemicals in the lake \nhas increased the incidence of diseases. More detailed sector analysis is in Appendix 3. \n \n12.  Weak institutions, inadequate capacity of the local government, and poor planning in the \nuse and allocation of the lake\u2019s water resources\u2014coupled with limited understanding of its \nintegral role in a basin-wide management framework\u2014have led to its overall degradation. This \nhas been aggravated by existing conflicts and overlaps in the roles of government agencies at \nthe  provincial  and  municipal  levels  on  water  use  and  allocation  driven  by  single-sector \napproaches. In addition, as economies in the urban centers grew rapidly (at an average of 11%/ \nyear),  economic  growth  became  the  primordial  goal  of  local  governments.  Consequently, \nregulatory and policy measures to ensure sustainable management of the lake\u2019s ecosystem \nwere hardly enforced. The situation was exacerbated by the public\u2019s inadequate awareness of \ntheir responsibility and limited incentives for the private sector to participate in the conservation \nof scarce water resources and the protection of the lake\u2019s ecosystem. \n \n13.  Government  Policies  and  Plans.  The  Government  recognizes  the  urgent  need  to \naddress prevailing ecosystem and water management issues in the basin through an integrated \napproach. It has included pollution control, sustainable use of water resources, and ecosystem \nmanagement  of  the  lake  as  one  of  the  country\u2019s  priority  programs  for  Agenda  21.  Hebei \nprovincial government designated the lake a Provincial Nature Reserve (PNR) in 2002, and in \n2003, an area of 34,000 hectares (ha) of natural forest in the upper watershed was protected. \nBMG has taken the responsibility as the custodian of the lake ecosystem by overseeing its \nrestoration  and  management.  These  actions  are  complemented  by  city  ordinances  that \n(i) prohibit setting up textile enterprises within 5 km of the lakeshores, (ii) introduce a gradual \nprice increase in water tariff, and (iii) enhance the lake surroundings for improved local tourism. \nThe Environmental Protection Bureau and local research institutes monitor the quality of the \nlake\u2019s  water  resources.  However,  more  efforts  are  needed  to  restore  the  lake\u2019s  primary \nfunctions to environmentally acceptable levels. \n \n14.  BMG\u2019s 11th Five-Year Environmental Protection Plan (FYEPP), 2006\u20132010, calls for an \n8% reduction in COD from the 2000 level, which is about 2% lower than the national target of \n10%. It will reduce the lake\u2019s pollution by 17% and improve its water quality to class III.8 The \nFYEPP aims to treat all urban sewage in Baoding City and about 60% (from 0% currently) in the \n22 counties/cities by 2010. It also provides for a series of pollution control and ecological \nrehabilitation programs. The planned reduction in COD levels, by constructing 27 WTPs, under \nthe  water  pollution  control  program,  is  relevant  to  this  Project.  The  FYEPP  also  includes \n                                                 \n6  The National Ambient Water Quality Standards for Surface Water divides water quality into five classes, with \nclass III being a minimum standard for drinking water and class V being the lowest quality equivalent to raw \nsewage. \n7  Baseline data from the 1960s is not available. However, it is believed that dozens of such species have become \nextinct. \n8  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople's Republic of China for the Hebei Province Wastewater Management Project. Manila (Loan 1985-PRC, for \n$82.360 million, approved on 19 December 2002). This ongoing Project is providing wastewater collection and \ntreatment in Baoding, Chengde, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou; capacity building for provincial and municipal \nsewerage companies; and introducing cost recovery and tariff structures. \n ", "5 \n(i) comprehensive rehabilitation of Baiyangdian Lake Wetland Reserve, (ii) safe disposal of fly \nash  from  thermal  power  plants,  (iii)  promotion  of  clean  energy  by  developing  geothermal \nresources, and (iv) reduction in the number of people without access to safe drinking water. The \nimplementation  of  the  national  south-to-north  water  reallocation  program  is  envisaged  to \nimprove the availability of water for domestic use, thereby increasing the net inflow in the basin. \nThe  Baiyangdian  Ecosystem  Rehabilitation  Master  Plan,  2005\u20132015,  likewise  calls  for  an \nintegrated approach in reducing pollution in the lake and rehabilitating ecosystems in the basin \nwith a planned investment of over $1.0 billion.  \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s  Operational  Strategy.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2008\u20132010,9 \nsupports the 11th FYP; and aims to help the country achieve economic growth in an efficient, \nequitable, and sustainable manner. In particular, ADB\u2019s strategy for the agriculture and natural \nresources  sector  supports  the  country\u2019s  transition  to  sustainable  agriculture  and  natural \nresources management and rural growth with a goal of reducing rural poverty by (i) improving \nsector  governance;  (ii)  providing  infrastructure  for  rural  development;  (iii)  addressing \nenvironmental issues such as land degradation, water and soil conservation, integrated water \nresources management, efficient water use and conservation, pollution control, and promoting \nsound natural resources management; and (iv) encouraging innovations responding to issues. \nThe proposed Project supports ADB\u2019s strategic priorities. \n \n16.  External Assistance. To overcome the constraints of its own programs, and to gain \nfrom international experience, the Government entered into a strategic partnership with GEF \nand other international partners to develop and scale up comprehensive resource management \napproaches  that  integrate  ecological,  economic,  and  social  dimensions  of  biodiversity \nmanagement.  Water  pollution  severely  endangers  the  PRC\u2019s  rich  biodiversity,  especially \nthrough  human  activities  that  destroy/degrade  natural  habitats,  through  land  conversions, \nindustrialization,  poor  management  of  water  resources,  and  deforestation.  ADB  and  other \ninternational agencies have provided a number of technical assistance and loan projects to \nassist  the  PRC  in  wetland  and  environmental  protection,  agriculture  and  natural  resource \ndevelopment, soil conservation, forestry, flood management, wastewater treatment, and water \nsupply. A list of relevant projects is in Appendix 4. \n \n17.  Lessons. Integrating water and ecosystem management is a relatively new concept in \nthe PRC, as well as in Hebei Province, and there has been little external assistance directly for \nbiodiversity conservation in Baiyangdian Basin. The United Nations Development Programme\u2019s \n(UNDP) GEF project\u2014Wetland Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Use in China, 2001\u2013\n2006, involving the wetlands of Sanjiang Plain, Dongting Lake, and Yancheng\u2014provided some \nlessons. However, this project adopted an engineering approach to restoring the hydraulic \nregime at specific nature reserves, and its institutional arrangements from national level through \nState Forestry Bureau were complicated and difficult to implement at the local level. ADB\u2019s \nongoing Sanjiang Plain Wetland Protection Project10 is (i) taking a holistic approach for wetland \nprotection and water resources management at basin level and not just at the nature reserve \nsites,  and  (ii) implementing  the  Project  at  the provincial  level  to  improve  interdepartmental \ncoordination. This Project will continue these efforts by enabling the integrated management of \nthe  ecosystem  and  water  resources  in  Baiyangdian  Basin  by  (i) supporting  institutional \ncoordination, (ii) ensuring adequate water quality and flow discharging to Baiyangdian Lake, (iii) \n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2008. People\u2019s Republic of China: Country Partnership Strategy 2008\u20132010. Manila. \n10 ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople's Republic of China for the Sanjiang Plain Wetlands Protection Project. Manila (Loan 2157, for $15 million, \napproved on 14 March 2005). \n  \n ", "6 \nestablishing links between communities around PNRs and sustainable livelihood development, \nand (iv) promoting sustainable tourism to increase biodiversity conservation. \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s experience in water resources management in the PRC indicates that projects \nare well implemented, and that water and wastewater tariffs are increased as required. Lessons \nlearned from previous projects were reflected in this project design by (i) undertaking thorough \nreview of technical designs and technologies, rigorous financial and economic analysis, detailed \nassessment of cash flows and social issues; (ii) introducing institutional strengthening measures \nto improve corporate governance; and (iii) ensuring an adequate debt-equity ratio for the project \nimplementing agencies (IAs). ADB\u2019s forest development projects in general provide lessons \nfrom various countries, indicating (i) community participation; and (ii) partnership between forest \ndepartment and participants, as key factors in the success of plantations and reforestation. \nThese lessons have also been incorporated in the design of this Project. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n19.  The impact of the proposed Project is improved quality of life, sustainable ecosystem, \nand biodiversity conservation in Baiyangdian Basin. The water quality in the basin and lake will \nimprove and water quantity in the lake will be maintained. Improved sanitation and clean water \nsupply will improve quality of life, and help contain morbidity and mortality rates. Biodiversity \nmanagement will increase the population of endangered species and improve the habitat of \nmigratory  birds.  In-lake  communities  will  gain  viable  and  sustainable  livelihoods  without \ndegrading the environment.  \n \n20.  The Project\u2019s outcome is integrated ecosystem and water management, and improved \nenvironmental conditions in Baiyangdian Basin. The Project will reduce each of the following \npollutants: COD by 37,884 tons/year; total suspended particles by 2,000 tons/year; SO  by \n2\n428 tons/year; carbon dioxide (CO ) by 28,121 tons/year; and TSP by 535 tons/year. It will \n2\nreduce morbidity rates by 10% and improve sanitation and hygiene for 1.12 million people. The \nProject will supply clean water to 260,000 people and provide enhanced flood protection to life \nand property for 51,000 people. It will help Baiyangdian in-lake communities take up eco-friendly \nalternative livelihoods, and maintain a sustainable water level at 6\u20139 meters (m).   \n \n21.  The Project will comprise four components: (i) subproject investments\u201422 subprojects \nof seven different categories (13 WTPs, 3 WSSs, 2 reforestation; and one each for urban flood \nmanagement [UFM], integrated water management [IWM], solid waste management [SWM]), \nand clean energy development [CED]; (ii) biodiversity conservation to support the proposed \nGEF-financed activities; (iii) institutional strengthening through a range of activities; and (iv) \nproject management support. A complete list of subprojects is in Appendix 5 and a more \ndetailed description of project activities follows. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n1.  Subproject Investments \n \n22.  This  is  the  largest  component  of  the  Project,  comprising  22  subprojects  in  seven \ncategories. A short description including key details of activities and outputs follows. \n \n23.  Wastewater Treatment Plants. The Project will support 13 WTPs, of which six are \nlocated  north/northeast,  five  southwest,  and  two  west  of  Baiyangdian  Lake  (Map  2).  The \nestimated service population is about 650,000. Upon completion, these plants will treat an \n ", "7 \nestimated 365,000 m3/day of wastewater and restrict organic pollution loading to the lake\u2014 \nannual removal of 36,850 tons of COD or about 43% of the targeted annual reduction of \n86,349 tons  under  the  FYEPP.  The  current  wastewater  tariffs  in  the  adjoining  towns  are \nCNY0.7\u20131.3/m3.  During  the  project  preparation  consultations,  beneficiaries  expressed  their \nwillingness to pay for the service beyond the requisite threshold (CNY1.3/m3) that will recover \nthe investment and operating costs. \n \n24.  The design forecasts are based on a comparison using a projection of several factors, \ni.e., population growth; increases in per capita water supply/use; and changes in industrial water \nuse caused by increases in production, unaccounted water loss, and improved efficiency in \nwater use. Almost all the subproject urban areas have existing combined sewers and essential \npumping stations that discharge untreated wastewater into the adjacent rivers and eventually to \nthe lake. Major industries within the service areas include tanneries, textile, paper, automobile, \nfertilizer, chemicals, and machinery plants.  \n \n25.  Water Supply Systems. The Project will support three WSSs located in Yi County, \nXiong  County,  and  Dingzhou  City  (Map  3).  Upon  completion,  they  will  supply  over \n106,600 m3/day of clean water to 194,000 domestic users. With rapid economic development \nand urbanization, the target population is projected to be around 430,000 by 2010. The new \nWSSs will help reduce the usage of private wells that cause unregulated and haphazard water \ndrawdown. The existing wells waste a considerable amount of water. The current water supply \nnetwork is also inefficient, causing water leakage rate of 20\u201340%. The new WSSs will ensure \nlong-term  and  sustainable  management  of  aquifers  and  significant  savings  in  distribution \nnetworks. Current domestic water tariffs are as follows: CNY2.11/m3 in Yi County, CNY1.6/m3 in \nXiong County, and CNY1.7/m3 in Dingzhou City. During the project preparation consultations, \npotential beneficiaries expressed their willingness to pay beyond the requisite thresholds that \nwill recover the investment and operating costs. \n \n26.  Reforestation. Deforestation in many parts of the basin has caused land degradation. \nEspecially in the hilly areas, denuded lands result in soil erosion. This subproject will support \nreforestation  of  18,450  ha  in  two  areas\u2014around  Angezhuang  Reservoir  in  Yi  County  and \naround  Baiyangdian  Lake  in  Anxin  County  (Map  3).  Reforestation  around  Angezhuang \nReservoir will cover 9,800 ha consisting of 2,000 ha of fast-growing and high-yielding forests, \n2,000 ha of water conservation forests, 4,850 ha of soil erosion control forests, and 950 ha of \necological protection forests with non-timber forest products. Another 8,650 ha area will be \ndeclared a mountain closure for forest recovery.11 Lakeside forestation will include (i) protection \nforests along lakeshore and main canals on 264 ha for 66 km; (ii) landscaping and protection \nforests on 1,200 ha around in-lake villages; (iii) environmental protection forests on 66 ha of \nbarren land; and (iv) ornamental forests on 33 ha of tourist sites.  \n \n27.  Urban Flood Management. Anxin County is located within the flood diversion area of \nBaiyangdian Lake (Map 3). With economic development and a population increase, the urban \narea has expanded northward. The existing embankment cannot protect the expanding city \nzone. This subproject will reinforce the quality of embankments and increase the protected area \nfrom 5.16 km2 to 19.47 km2; and improve the flood control standard from the recurrence period \nof 20\u201350 years to protect life and properties in the Anxin County effectively. \n                                                 \n11  The mountain closure policy does not mean absolutely no access but implies that the subproject area will not be \nallowed for free grazing or logging. The mountain land belongs to local households and communities in addition to \ntheir farmlands. They will be allowed to harvest non-timber forest products, without interfering with subproject \nactivities. Once reforestation starts, young trees will require protection from human and livestock interventions. The \nmountain closure policy guards against such interventions. The livelihood activities will not be affected, as local \nhouseholds have their farmlands separate from mountain lands. \n ", "8 \n28.  Integrated  Water  Management.  Wangkuai  Reservoir  on  the  Sha  River  currently \ndischarges 170 million m3 down the Sha aqueduct to replenish the lake. However, starting 2010, \nthis  aqueduct  will  be  used  exclusively  for  the  Government\u2019s  South-North  Water  Transfer \nProject\u2014a national mega-project to link Yangtze River to Yellow River. It is, therefore, urgent to \nsecure an alternative route to supply water to the lake and to maintain its ecosystem. The \nproposed link canal will connect Wangkuai Reservoir to Xidayang Reservoir (Tang River Basin) \nand upgrade the existing Tang aqueduct downstream of Xidayang Reservoir which discharges \ninto the lake (Map 4). About 200 million m3 of water will be diverted per annum from Wangkuai \nReservoir, and 128 million m3 is expected to replenish the lake after deducting conveyance \nlosses. This volume is sufficient to maintain the lake\u2019s water at an ecologically acceptable level \n(7.3 m). An alternative route considered was the existing Sha River, which has dried up since \nthe  construction  of  Wangkuai  Reservoir.  This  alternative  was  deemed  inefficient  because \nthrough this route, only 60 million m3 will reach the lake because of the high infiltration rate of \nthe Sha River course (conveyance efficiency is estimated to be only 30%). An additional benefit \nof  the  proposed  design  is  floodwater  harvesting.  The  excess  floodwater  that  cannot  be \nregulated by the two reservoirs will be used to recharge the Yimuquan aquifer located adjacent \nto Baoding City. This will contribute to increasing the groundwater resources that the city relies \non as its source of drinking water.  \n \n29.  Solid Waste Management. Huanghuagou is a heavily polluted river flowing through \nBaoding City (Map 5). Major sources of pollution include the (i) dump site adjacent to the river, \nwhich has no leachate control; (ii) open-air ash storage of Baoding Cogeneration Plant; and \n(iii) wastewater  pit,  which  collects  domestic  and  industrial  wastewater  and  discharges  to \nHuanghuagou River. This subproject aims to improve the environment of Huanghuagou River \nand its surrounding area through four interventions: (i) relocation of the dump site; (ii) closure of \nthe ash storage; (iii) improvement of 0.5 km of Huanghuagou River; and (iv) rehabilitation of the \narea currently used for the dump site, wastewater pit, and ash storage into an eco-theme park \nand urban land for future development (Map 6). The existing waste materials were dumped here \nbefore 2003\u2014dumping at this site has been prohibited ever since. These waste materials will be \ntransported  to  Baoding  Municipal  Solid  Waste  Landfill,  which  has  sufficient  capacity  to \naccommodate all 550,000 m3 of waste. The leachate from the dump site will also be treated in \nrelevant facilities there. The ash (2 million m3) will be transported to concrete and brick factories \nand construction sites around Baoding and other cities, including Beijing and Tianjin.12 The ash-\nflushing water will be treated in the existing and proposed WTPs, while the settled silt from ash-\nflushing water will be disposed of in Baoding Municipal Solid Waste Landfill. Wastewater flowing \ninto Huanghuagou River via wastewater pit will be intercepted and pumped to the existing \nLugang WTP. This subproject will significantly improve the environment of the target area, and \nthe eco-theme park is expected to raise public awareness on environmental protection.  \n \n30.  Clean Energy Development. Xiong County, located northeast of the lake, has abundant \ngeothermal resources. Currently, the coal chimneys, used for space-heating, spew ash on the \nlake, adding to its pollution (Map 3). Geothermal water is already used for space-heating of \n600,000 m2 and there are 19 public hot-spring bathhouses. The purpose of this subproject is to \nenhance the use of clean geothermal resources to heat an additional area of 1,650,000 m2 of \nlocal private housing and public building complexes. Geothermal space-heating will replace the \nuse of 60,000 tons of coal each winter; and will reduce emissions of CO , COD, SO  and ash \n2 2\nthat pollute both air and water. The geothermal resources will also be used for economic \nactivities such as hot-spring bathing and other leisure/health attractions, as well as for 13 ha of \n                                                 \n12  Fly ash is a valuable resource/raw material for cement, concrete, and many other value-added applications such \nas brick manufacturing and road construction\u2014primarily because of its pozzolanic characteristic. Currently, the \nmarket demand for ash is good considering many highway projects, i.e., Changshi and Baochuang expressway. \n ", "9 \ngeothermal greenhouses and 2 ha of aquaculture. The proposed geothermal space-heating \nplan  comprises  three  main  components:  (i)  geothermal  resource  production,  (ii)  reinjection \nsystem, and (iii) space-heating distribution system. The subproject will install 11 geothermal \nproduction wells and 10 reinjection wells, among other facilities such as heat exchanger stations \nand distribution pipes. Reinjection ensures sustainable exploration of geothermal resources, \nand reduces the environmental impact of discharged geothermal water. This subproject will \nimprove both the air and water quality of Xiong County and will help initiate a program to make \nXiong a \u201csmokeless town.\u201d Current space-heating tariffs are CNY12\u201315/m3 for domestic and \nCNY15\u201318/m3  for  commercial  consumers.  During  the  project  preparation  consultations, \npotential beneficiaries expressed their willingness to pay for the service beyond the requisite \nthresholds that will recover the investment and operating costs. \n \n31.  The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), established under the Kyoto Protocol and \nmanaged by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, has significant \npotential to provide additional carbon financing to support the development of clean energy \nprojects in the PRC. This geothermal subproject is eligible for additional carbon financing but \nrequired development of a new CDM Methodology. As a result, the Technical Support Facility of \nADB\u2019s Carbon Market Initiative (CMI) has prepared a new methodology for this subproject \ntogether with a Project Design Document (Supplementary Appendix A). The new baseline \nmethodology is under consideration by the Methodology Panel of the CDM Executive Board and \nits views are expected by the end of June 2008. \n \n32.   Estimated  emission  reductions  under  this  subproject,  based  on  the  proposed \nmethodology, are 119,393 tons of CO  equivalent (tCO e) per year.13 At a price of $12/tCO e, \n2 2 2\nthis could generate annual revenues of about $1.43 million to the subproject up to 2012.14 \nAssuming that the subproject would be operational by mid 2010 and reduce emissions for 2.5 \nyears by 2012, the subproject would generate 0.29 million tCO e, which will produce $3.58 \n2\nmillion in revenues. The Asia Pacific Carbon Fund (APCF), under CMI, has expressed interest \nin  purchasing  a  portion  of  the  Certified  Emission  Reductions  (CERs)  generated  by  this \nsubproject up to 31 December 2012. APCF can purchase up to 50% of CERs upfront.15 Based \non the above calculations, APCF\u2019s upfront payment to Xiong County could amount to $1.79 \nmillion.16 This would be equivalent to about 9.6% of the total subproject cost. In line with the \nProject\u2019s social development objective, Xiong County has agreed to share 50% of the carbon \ncredit revenues with the Xiong County poverty reduction agency to expand its activities. This will \nbe an incremental amount over and above the prevailing budget of the Agency. \n \n2.   Biodiversity Conservation \n \n33.  Through a range of interventions, the subproject activities will help alleviate general \necosystem  constraints  in  the  basin  by  improving  water  quality  and  quantity.  These \nimprovements are a prerequisite for bringing about the global environmental benefits envisioned \n                                                 \n13   These are preliminary estimates assuming that the proposed methodology is approved by the Methodology \nPanel of the Clean Development Mechanism\u2019s Executive Board. \n14    Market price varies considerably primarily based on delivery risk. Based on the current market, $12/tCO e is \n2\nconsidered to be a conservative estimate.  \n15   Asia Pacific Carbon Fund team will start negotiations with the implementing agency of the subproject to finalize \nthe  Certified  Emission  Reductions  purchase  agreement  soon  after  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism\u2019s \nExecutive Board approves the proposed methodology and after the final Project Design Document is available.    \n16   The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ends on 31 December 2012. Carbon credits generated up to \nthis point can be sold to the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund and it can purchase 50% upfront from the developer \n(Xiong County). Carbon credits generated after 2012 and through 2020 could be sold directly by the developer \nand may amount to about $6.2 million (assuming a conservative price of $5/tCO e). Therefore, the subproject will \n2\npotentially generate about $10.0 million of carbon credit revenues through 2021. \n ", "10 \nfor the GEF component. These benefits will be realized by encouraging integrated ecosystem \nmanagement in the basin, and strengthening conservation of globally significant biodiversity \nresources in two provincial nature reserves (PNRs): (i) Jin Hua Shan-Heng Lingzi Shan PNR, \nhabitat for the endemic brown-eared pheasant (Crossoptilon mantchuricum) and other rare \nspecies; and (ii) Baiyangdian Lake Rare Bird PNR, a vital stopover along the East Asian\u2013\nAustralasian flyway for numerous species of rare and vulnerable migratory waterfowl (Map 7). \nThe proposed GEF financing will support six \u201cmodules,\u201d each of which is considered essential \nfor achieving the desired global environmental benefits. The specific activities to be undertaken \nfor  each  module  are  in  Appendix 6.  The  full-size  project  brief  for  the  GEF  Secretariat\u2019s \nconsideration is in Supplementary Appendix B. The cofinancing has been endorsed by the \nGovernment as part of its GEF biodiversity allocation, and it is due for GEF Counsel\u2019s approval \nby August 2008.  \n \n  3.  Institutional Strengthening \n \n34.  The  capacity  of  county  and  IA  staff  to  implement  their  respective  subprojects  is \ninadequate.  A  detailed  plan  will  be  prepared  during  the  inception phase  of  the  Project  to \ndetermine  the  requirements  for  capacity  building  and  institutional  strengthening  as  well  as \ndevelop the strategy for their implementation. A variety of training programs will be initiated that \ninclude on-the-job training; short-term in-country training through workshops, study tours, and \nshort courses; and short-term overseas training through study tours and training courses. The \nstaff and institutional capacity assessment during project preparation revealed that training will \nbe required in the following areas: (i) project implementation, (ii) environmental management \nand safeguards, (iii) ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation, (iv) gender and \ndevelopment, (v) financial management, and (vi) project audit. A more detailed institutional \nassessment and training program is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n  4.  Project Management Support \n \n35.  Given the inadequate staff capacity in key disciplines, a project management support \noffice, complete with logistical facilities and technical staff, has been provided for effective \nproject implementation. An international project implementation specialist will be provided to \nrender technical advice to the project management office (PMO) and project implementation \nunits (PIUs) in project supervision and capacity building in integrated ecosystem and water \nresources management. International and national experts in the following disciplines will also \nbe provided to support project management: (i) institutional/training development; (ii) water \nresources planning; (iii) structural, civil, mechanical, electrical, wastewater, solid waste and \ngeothermal  engineering;  (iv)  watershed  management;  (v)  resettlement  and  environmental \nmonitoring; (vi) procurement; (vii) financial management; and (viii) forestry. They will provide \ntechnical assistance to concerned BMG and county agencies in the various aspects of project \nimplementation,  including,  among  others,  community  organization  and  social  preparation, \nlivelihood  demonstration,  environmental  monitoring,  institutional  strengthening,  gender  and \ndevelopment, and project monitoring and evaluation, as necessary. Detailed terms of reference \nand a full list of experts are in Appendix 7. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n36.  In the PRC, like most other countries, the threat to the environment is multi-sectoral but \nthe response often follows a single-sector approach which is not always efficient. As elsewhere \nin the PRC, soil, water, and air pollution in Baiyangdian Basin is caused by the urban, industrial, \nand agricultural sectors. The agricultural sector, with its nonpoint sources\u2014farm chemicals \nrunoff, animal waste, and rural domestic wastewater\u2014contributes more pollution than other \nsectors. Deforestation causes loss in biodiversity by destroying wildlife habitats. Soil erosion, \n ", "11 \nmostly  caused  by  deforestation,  is  another  major  source  of  water  pollution.  This  Project \n\u201cintegrates\u201d the Government\u2019s response to contain pollution in the basin by adopting a multi-\nsectoral,  multidisciplinary,  and  interagency  planning,  investment,  and  monitoring  approach. \nSeven different categories of investment under this Project will bring together agriculture, forest, \nwater resources, urban development, energy, and environmental protection bureaus of BMG to \ncoordinate their activities. Through the IWM subproject, this Project will also (i) integrate the \nefficient use of water resources between two sub-watersheds; and (ii) supply water to four \ndifferent end users\u2014the lake (biodiversity conservation); Baoding City (drinking water); Guohua \nDingzhou  Power  Plant  (industrial);  and  Baicaogou,  Hu,  Yimuquan,  Hucheng,  and  Xihuanti \nBaoding inner-city rivers (pollution control). Through these investment and activities, the Project \nwill integrate the ecosystem and water resources management that, in turn, will meet the \nobjective of biodiversity conservation. Therefore, this Project (i) demonstrates an innovative \nintegrated  ecosystem  management  approach  to  bringing  about  improvements  in  water \nresources management within the basin; (ii) focuses on the critical need to conserve wetlands, \none of PRC\u2019s most important and vulnerable ecosystems; and (iii) fits well with an umbrella \nprogram for biodiversity conservation currently being formulated by the PRC. \n \n37.  While the infrastructure interventions of the Project are designed primarily to improve \nwaste management, reduce water and air pollution, provide clean energy, and improve the \nreliability of water supplies for communities in the basin, the GEF component will complement \nthese improvements by raising awareness and promoting the involvement of local communities \nin  natural  resources  management.  The  Project  has  taken  the  initiative  to  apply  Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism to earn carbon credits under the CED subproject. There is a potential \nto arrange upfront financing of $5.4 million through the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund. In line with the \nProject\u2019s social development objective, Xiong County has agreed to share 50% of the carbon \ncredit revenues with the Xiong County poverty reduction agency to expand its activities. This will \nbe an incremental amount over and above the prevailing budget of the Agency.  \n \n38.  Another  subject  of  increasing  concern  for  the  PRC  is  conservation  of  the  nation\u2019s \nvulnerable wetland resources. In response, the Government recently (2007) created a special \nOffice  of  Wetland  Conservation  and  Management  within  the  State  Forest  Administration. \nBaiyangdian Lake has been recognized in Agenda 21 as one of the nation\u2019s most critical \nwetland areas. It is expected that restoration of the wetland ecosystem in Baiyangdian Lake will \nbring about significant economic and environmental benefits. The China Biodiversity Partnership \nFramework, currently being formulated by UNDP with support from GEF, has identified several \npriority themes, including (among others) reduction of biodiversity loss in protected areas, and \nmainstreaming of biodiversity conservation in socioeconomic sectors. This Project will further \nthese objectives, so it is consistent with the framework initiative currently under development. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan  \n \n39.  The total project investment is estimated at about $273.4 million equivalent. It includes \nprovisions for physical and price contingencies which will be shouldered by the Government, \ninterest during construction, and a commitment fee, and is spread over an implementation \nperiod of 5 years. Physical contingencies are estimated at 10% of all base costs while price \ncontingencies are based on ADB\u2019s estimates of local and foreign currency escalation factors. A \nsummary of project cost estimates by component is in Table 1.

Interest during construction has been \ncomputed at the 5-year forward London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), with a spread of 0.2%.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n40.  The Government has requested a loan of $100.00 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a term of 25 years, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15%/annum and such \nother terms and conditions as set forth in the Loan Agreement. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility \nand the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its \nown independent decision and not made in reliance on any advice or communication from ADB. \nIn addition to the loan from ADB, which will finance about 36.6% of total costs, a proposed grant \nof $2,975,000 from GEF will finance 1.1% of project costs. The proposed GEF grant will finance \nall  the  activities  of  the  biodiversity  conservation  component  and  part  of  the  institutional \nstrengthening and project management support components. ADB will administer the GEF \ngrant. The proposed GEF financing will be provided to the IAs as grant. The Borrower will be the \nPRC, which will relend the loan proceeds amounting to $100.00 million to the Hebei provincial \ngovernment on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. Hebei provincial \ngovernment will onlend the proceeds of the loan to BMG, which will onlend to city, township, \ncounty governments. The city, township, and county governments then will onlend to IAs. Each \nIA  will  be  a  sub-borrower  and  will  enter  into  an  onlending  agreement  with  the \ncity/township/county government, commission, or autonomous zone for its share of the ADB \nloan funds and will be responsible for its repayment. All relending and onlending will be on the \nsame terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. The IAs will assume the foreign exchange \nand  interest  rate  variation  risks  for  the  ADB  loan.  Counterpart  funds  will  come  from  self-\nfinancing by the IAs.

ADB  typically  seeks  Board  approval  for  the  administration  of  grant  funds  from  co-\nfinanciers only when cofinancing commitments are in place. In the case of the proposed grant \nfunding  from  GEF,  the  financing  is  expected  to  be  approved  by  the  GEF  Council  in \nAugust 2008. To avoid any project delay, the Board is requested to approve the administration \nof the proposed grant, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $2,975,000, which is \nexpected to be confirmed by GEF subsequent to the date of Board approval. Approval of the \nGEF grant will be reported to the Board in accordance with the standard reporting procedures. If \nGEF does not approve grant financing, the GEF-financed activities of the Project will not be \nimplemented under the Project. Alternatively, the Government may make other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB to cover the funding shortfall. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n \n42.  The 22 subprojects will be implemented in 13 counties by 24 IAs. BMG, acting through \nBaoding Development and Reform Commission (BDRC), will be the Executing Agency of the \nProject. BDRC has set up a central PMO with 15 staff to implement the Project.17 A full-time \nproject director has been appointed to head the PMO. The key PMO staff have expertise in \nfinancial  management;  civil  and  mechanical  engineering;  water  resources,  environmental, \necosystem, and project management; social development; and forestry. Each county will set up \na PIU at their respective financial bureaus. PIUs will be headed by project coordinators, who will \nbe focal points for all project-related activities with the PMO. IAs will engage the relevant design \ninstitutes to prepare detailed subproject designs. These detailed designs will be reviewed by a \npanel that will be assisted by an independent consulting firm. To assist IAs in the procurement \nprocess\u2014i.e., preparing bidding documents, call for tenders, and bid evaluation\u2014specialized \nfirms will be engaged. To monitor the progress and quality of works, construction supervision \nfirms will be engaged. The PMO staff will assist IAs in supervising the inputs of design institutes \nand the specialized consulting firms. To coordinate the project activities among line bureaus and \nIAs, BDRC will set up a project Leading Group that will meet quarterly for the first 2 years and \nsemiannually  for  the  remaining  project  period.  The  relevant  IAs  will  establish  project  land \nacquisition resettlement units for supervising implementation, continuing public consultation, \n                                                 \n17 The PMO was set up in October 2007. The PRC Resident Mission has provided initial training to the PMO/PIU staff \non procurement, disbursement, and project administration through workshops in December 2007.  \n ", "14 \nresponding to grievances, and reporting progress. The grievance redress procedures are set \nout in the resettlement plans (RPs). To redress any other grievances, one staff member in each \nPIU and PMO will be nominated to receive complaints and arrange to provide an appropriate \nresponse or take necessary actions and follow up until the concern has been resolved. If the \nproblem cannot be resolved by the PMO, the complainant can make a formal grievance in \naccordance  with  State  Council  Decree  431,  2005.  A  project  website  will  be  set  up  to \ndisseminate information about the project scope, implementation progress, public consultation, \nand grievance redress process and updates. The project organization chart is presented in \nAppendix 9. Details of the organizational structure for the PMO/PIUs and terms of reference for \ntheir respective staff are in Supplementary Appendix E.   \n \n  2.  Implementation Period \n \n43.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years from October 2008 to 30 September 2013. \nThe project implementation schedule is in Appendix 10.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n44.  All procurement of goods and works shall be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Contracts for goods estimated \nto exceed $1.0 million and contracts for works estimated to exceed $10.0 million shall be \nprocured using international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. Contracts for goods and \nworks estimated to cost equal to or less than the above ICB values, but more than $100,000, \nshall be procured through national competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the PRC \nTendering and Bidding Law, 1999, subject to clarifications and modifications agreed with ADB. \nContracts for goods and works estimated to cost $100,000 or less shall be procured using the \nshopping  procedures,  and  those  for  less  than  $10,000  through  direct  contracting.  A \nprocurement plan, setting out an indicative list of all procurement packages, the procurement \nmethods to be used, and the timing of ADB review is in Appendix 11. The plan will be reviewed \nand updated on an annual basis. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) will be included in all procurement documents and contracts. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n45.  The Project will finance two consulting packages. Package A, for 236 person-months, \nfinanced by the loan, will comprise three international experts for 25 person-months and 14 \nnational experts for 211 person-months. A consulting firm will be engaged to provide these \nservices. The PMO will be responsible for the selection, contract negotiations, and contract \nmanagement. Package B, financed by the proposed GEF grant, for 180 person-months, will \ncomprise eight international experts for 38 person-months and nine national experts for 142 \nperson-months. ADB will recruit the firm and the PMO will negotiate and manage the contract. \nIn selecting these firms, quality and cost-based selection (80:20) will be used, and the short-\nlisted firms will be required to submit full technical proposals for contract budgets of more than \n$1.0 million. A summary of consulting packages is in Appendix 7. All recruitment will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n \n  5.   Retroactive Financing \n \n46.  BMG has requested retroactive financing for the Yi County WTP for a maximum amount \nequivalent  to  $3,800,000  or  3.8%  of  the  loan.  As  the  processing  of  this  loan  has  been \nunexpectedly delayed by almost 8 months, ADB has advised that retroactive financing could \n ", "15 \napply to expenditures incurred before loan effectiveness and within 20 months prior to the \nsigning  of  the  loan  agreement.  All  contracts  proposed  for  retroactive  financing  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants.  The  Government  and  BMG  have  been  advised  that  approval  of  the \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n47.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with BMG and the IAs. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding \ndocuments for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB and GEF in connection \nwith the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of BMG; the IAs; and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other \nservice  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The  project  design  and  implementation \narrangements  provide  for  mitigating  corruption  risks.  Risks  associated  with  project \nmanagement, including procurement and disbursement, will be mitigated by (i) engaging an \ninternational consultant and a national consultant to advise and assist in the procurement of \ngoods and services, and the engagement of other consultants; (ii) introducing a dual signing \nsystem in which the civil works contractor awarded the contract will also sign an anticorruption \ncontract  with  the  employer;  and  (iii)  periodical  inspection  by  the  PMO  of  the  contractor\u2019s \nactivities  related  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements.  In  furtherance  of  the  principles  of \ntransparency and accountability, BMG will cause the PMO to set up and develop a project \nwebsite that describes the Project in order to provide the public with information on the Project \nincluding setting out (i) a summary of the audited financial statements of the Project, and \n(ii) tracking of procurement contract awards in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \nBMG will ensure that each IA establishes financial control and management arrangements \ncompatible with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Financial Governance and Management of Investment \nProjects Financed by ADB18 and ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n48.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook. To facilitate project implementation and funds flow, an imprest account will be set up \nin a commercial bank acceptable to ADB upon loan effectiveness and a separate account will \nlikewise be opened for GEF grant funds. Both accounts will be managed by Baoding Finance \nBureau on behalf of BMG. The initial advance deposited in the imprest account will not exceed \n6 months of estimated expenditures or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The direct \npayment procedures will apply for the large works contracts. If the Government initially funds \neligible expenditures from its own resources, the reimbursement procedure will be used. To \nexpedite funds flow and simplify the documentation process, the statement of expenditures \nprocedure will be followed for liquidation and replenishment of the imprest account and for \nreimbursement of eligible expenditures not exceeding $100,000/individual payment. Payments \nin excess of the statement of expenditures ceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, or replenished \nbased on the full supporting documentation process. To expedite project implementation, BMG \nrequested ADB to approve retroactive financing of eligible expenditures up to $3.8 million \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2002.

The  PMO  requires  additional  capacity  and  experience  to  deal  efficiently  with  the \noperation and withdrawal procedures necessary for the operation of the imprest accounts. \nAccordingly, assistance and training will be provided so that PMO staff can expedite loan and \nGEF  grant  disbursements.  An  assessment  of  the  financial  management  capability  of  the \nFinancial Bureau of BMG and IAs, and specific arrangements for managing the project funds, \nare provided in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n   \n50.  All agencies (PMO, PIUs, and IAs) involved in project implementation will maintain \nrecords and accounts that identify goods and services from loan proceeds and the GEF grant, \nfinancing resources received, expenditures incurred, and use of local funds. These accounts will \nbe  established  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and \ninternationally accepted accounting standards. The PMO will review and consolidate these \naccounts and have them audited annually in accordance with sound accounting practices by the \nsovereign audit agency of the Government or other auditors acceptable to ADB. The audit \nreport will include a statement verifying whether or not the funds disbursed by ADB were used \nfor the purposes for which they were provided, as well as the auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the \nimprest account and statement of expenditures procedures. Copies of the audited accounts and \nauditor\u2019s report will be submitted to ADB within 6 months after the end of each financial year. \nThe  PMO  will  prepare  consolidated  quarterly  reports  indicating  progress  made,  problems \nencountered during the period, steps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, proposed \nprogram of activities, and progress expected for the next quarter. Both the loan and GEF grant \nwill be covered in these reports. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the PMO \nwill submit to ADB a completion report that describes the achievements in relation to the \nProject\u2019s expected impact, outcome, and outputs.  \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n51.  To monitor the progress of the Project in achieving the planned outcome and outputs, \nthe PMO will establish and maintain a project performance management system (PPMS), which \nwill be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action regarding project design, \nschedules, activities, and development impacts. The PPMS will adopt the following agreed \nindicators:  (i)  physical  progress  of  subproject  implementation,  (ii)  results  of  the  capacity \ndevelopment program, (iii) water quality and quantity improvements in the lake and other water \nbodies, (iv) improvement in biodiversity conservation, and (v) social development. At project \ninception, the PMO, in consultation with each IA, will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures \nto  generate  data  systematically  on  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  project  activities;  and  the \nsocioeconomic, health, and environmental indicators to measure project impacts.  \n \n52.  The PMO will refine the PPMS framework, confirm achievable targets, firm up monitoring \nand recording arrangements, and establish systems and procedures no later than 6 months \nafter project implementation begins. Baseline and progress data will be reported at the requisite \ntime intervals by IAs to the PMO, including annual reporting on the environmental management \nplan (EMP). The PMO will be responsible for analyzing and consolidating reported data through \nits  management  information  system,  and  for  reporting outcomes  to  ADB  through  quarterly \nprogress reports.  \n \n \n ", "17 \n10.  Project Review \n \n53.  In addition to regular monitoring, project performance will be reviewed at least once a \nyear  jointly  by  ADB,  the  Government,  and  BMG.  The  review  will  assess  implementation \nperformance and achievement of project outcomes and outputs, assess financial progress, \nidentify issues and constraints affecting implementation, and work out a time-bound action plan \nfor their resolution. ADB, the Government, and BMG will undertake a midterm review to assess \nimplementation status and take appropriate measures\u2014including modification of scope and \nimplementation arrangements, and reallocation of loan and grant proceeds, as appropriate\u2014to \nachieve the project objectives. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n54.  The Project will improve quality of life, ecosystem, and biodiversity in the basin. Twenty-\ntwo complementing subproject investments will be supported to mitigate water and air pollution \nthat will subsequently improve environmental and ecological conditions in the basin. Thirteen \nWTPs will significantly reduce organic pollution loading of the lake as well as improve water \nquality in its extensive river network. Three WSSs will increase the availability of potable water \nas  well  as  improve  sanitation  and  hygiene  among  project  beneficiaries.  Reforestation  of \nAngezhuang Reservoir and Baiyangdian Lake and rehabilitation of Huanghuangou watershed \nwill improve the water retention capacity of these subproject areas. These interventions are also \nexpected  to  facilitate  biodiversity  conservation  and  improve  the  integrity  of  the  basin\u2019s \necosystem. The Project will also generate significant social and economic benefits, such as \nimproved living conditions and livelihood opportunities for communities living within the basin \nand especially by the lake. The flood control subproject is expected to significantly reduce \ndamage to public and private infrastructure as well as to agricultural production due to flooding \nthat have increased in frequency in recent years. The reservoir link-canal subproject will enable \nthe recharging of the Yimuquan aquifer with clean water, and prevent the intrusion of polluted \nwater from Caohe drainage area during low water table levels. Mitigation of this problem will \nreduce the incidence of stomach and intestinal diseases, which are likely to occur without the \nProject. The geothermal energy subproject\u2014an alternative to using coal for providing space-\nheating  to  domestic,  commercial,  and  industrial  consumers\u2014will  contribute  to  energy  cost \nsavings as well as result in reductions in emission of air pollutants, with positive impacts on the \nenvironment and health of affected communities. Benefits from GEF interventions under the \nbiodiversity and integrated ecosystem management component will emanate from improved \nwildlife and overall environmental conditions within the basin.  \n \n55.  The  WTPs  and  WSSs  will  benefit  about  1.12  million  people  (or  over  416,000 \nhouseholds),  out  of  a  total  of  about  6.65  million  people  living  within  the  drainage  area. \nImprovement in water supply will reduce the incidence of stomach and intestinal diseases for \nover  260,000  people.  About  10,000  ha  of  farmland  will  be  protected  from  soil  erosion, \nparticularly during the rainy months, with the reforestation of the Angezhuang Reservoir area. \nThis will benefit a total of about 18,750 farm households and will prevent an annual loss in crop \ndamage of about $2.2 million. At full development of the Baiyangdian lakeside reforestation \nsubproject, a significant increase in tourist activities will generate about $585,000 annually. \nRehabilitation  of  Huanghuangou  watershed  will  reduce  dust  pollution  by  about  136,000 \ntons/year, and prevent further contamination of surface and subterranean water, with a positive \nimpact on the health of about 500,000 people in Baoding City. Health benefits will also be \nderived from the reallocation of water resources for about 700,000 people in Baoding City and Li \nCounty. The construction of flood control facilities in Anxin County will protect and reduce flood \n ", "18 \ndamage to an area of about 20 km2 including about 9,300 ha farmland (about 5,000 farm \nhouseholds),  about  1,152  m2 of  residential  facilities,  about  30  small  enterprises,  and \nthe municipal facilities in Anxin County. The incidence of respiratory diseases will be reduced by \n20% among the target population (about 240,000 people) who will benefit from the shift from \ncoal to geothermal energy. The CED subproject will save about 60,000 tons of coal annually \nand result in reduced incidence of SO  (about 1,000 tons/year) and total suspended particles \n2\n(about 500 tons/year) emissions. \n \n56.  Project  activities  will  enhance  the  environment  and  improve  the  ecosystem  within \nBaiyangdian Basin. Biodiversity conservation benefits will accrue through restored habitat and \nprotection for wild plants and animals, including 192 bird species of which at least six are of \nglobal significance. \n \n1.  Financial Analysis \n \n57.  Financial analyses were undertaken for each of the 19 revenue-generating subprojects, \nbased on their respective revenue and cost streams over a 25-year period. Revenue from the \n13  WTPs  and  3 WSSs  will  be  derived  from  subproject-specific  operating  capacity  at  the \nspecified  tariff/m3  charged  to  consumers.  The  geothermal  energy  subproject  will  generate \nrevenues by providing space-heating services to about 1.65 million m2 of floor area in different \ntypes of buildings, about 525,000 m2 of public baths and swimming pools, about 100,000 m2 of \nhotel facilities, and drinking water supply of about 250,000 m3. The Angezhuang Reservoir \nreforestation  subproject  will  derive  revenue  from  the  sale  of  timber  while  the  Baiyangdian \nlakeside reforestation subproject will generate revenue from timber sales and tourism as well. \nFor the remaining three subprojects\u2014IWM, ash/waste-dump rehabilitation, and flood control\u2014\ncosts are likewise estimated but no financial revenues are quantified. Financial internal rates of \nreturn (FIRRs) and other financial indicators were estimated for 19 subprojects. The estimated \nFIRRs are in the range of 7.6\u201315.9%, above the weighted average cost of capital of 2.3%. This \nreflects their financial viability as well as ability to recover both investment and operating costs. \nHowever, the FIRRs are found to be sensitive to variations in revenue and costs. More detailed \nfinancial analysis is in Appendix 12. \n \n2.  Economic Analysis \n \n58.  The national policy for pollution control endorses the use of cost-effective wastewater \nmanagement measures to achieve overall treatment targets. The least-cost analysis for each of \nthe 13 WTPs indicates that the chosen technology entails the lowest cost compared with other \ntechnologies  available.  Separate  economic  analyses  are  also  carried  out  for  all  of  the \n22 subprojects and the whole Project. Benefit estimates are based on data that reflect the \ncurrent situation and on conservative assessments of future scenarios without the Project. \nHealth benefits arising from WTPs and WSSs are quantified based on reductions in medical \ncosts for about 1.66 million people, mainly from stomach and intestinal diseases and hepatitis, \ncaused  by  improved  water  quality.  Health  benefits  resulting  from  reduced  incidence  in \nrespiratory diseases and subsequently in medical costs, affecting about 240,000 people, which \nwill accrue to the clean energy subproject, are also quantified. Energy savings resulting from \nreduction  in  coal  use  (about  60,000  tons/year),  subsequent  reduction  in  SO   (about \n2\n1,000 tons/year) and coal dust (about 500 tons/year) emissions are quantified and incorporated \nin the economic analysis of the clean energy subproject. Health benefits are also quantified for \nthe ash/waste dump rehabilitation subproject, which will reduce dust pollution and prevent \ncontamination of surface and subterranean water with a positive impact on the health of about \n500,000 people in Baoding City. Health benefits will likewise accrue to the IWM subproject, \nwhich will impact on about 0.7 million people in Baoding City and Li County. Benefits generated \n ", "19 \nby the reforestation subprojects are quantified based on estimates of annual revenues from sale \nof timber and increased tourist activity as well as from prevention of losses in crop damage \ncaused by soil erosion. Reductions in annual flood damage caused by the construction of flood \ncontrol facilities served as the basis for estimating the economic benefits from the urban flood \ncontrol subproject. The economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) estimated for each of the \n22 subprojects are in the range of 14.5\u201323.6%, greater than the economic opportunity cost of \ncapital of 12%. \n \n59.  The project EIRR is estimated at about 17% with an economic net present value of \n$190 million. Switching values indicate that benefits should decline by not more than 19% to \nmaintain the project EIRR at 12%. Economic costs, on the other hand, should not increase by \nmore than 23%. Simultaneous decrease in benefits and increase in costs should be at 10%. A \n1-year delay in project benefits will result in an EIRR of 13.7%. More detailed economic analysis \nis in Appendix 12. \n \n3.  Risks \n \n60.  The  Project  will  adopt  an  integrated  approach  to  address  ecosystem  and  water \nresources issues, and for the planning and implementation of project activities. Line bureaus \nand counties in Baoding Municipality do not often coordinate their operations. In the past, \neconomic growth has taken priority over environmental management. The frequency of drought \nyears has also been on the rise over the past two decades and climate change may further \nreduce water availability. If the constraints underlying these risks are not addressed, the project \ninvestments may not achieve the intended impact. These risks can be mitigated in part by \nproject  interventions,  i.e.,  (i)  inculcating  integrated  planning,  monitoring,  and  enforcing \nappropriate  policies  and  regulations;  and  (ii)  building  staff  capacity  and  strengthening \ninstitutions.  Other  risks  include  (i)  lack  of  understanding  of  ADB  policies  and  procedures, \n(ii) changes in PMO staff, (iii) lengthy procurement decision making, and (iv) procurement fraud \nand corruption. To mitigate these risks, the Project will provide technical and management \nadvisory support and training, particularly during the first 2 years of implementation. Delays in \nsubproject  completion  can  also  jeopardize  project  investment.  Implementation  of  the  IWM \nsubproject needs to be monitored carefully so that it is completed before the Government\u2019s \nSouth\u2013North Water Transfer Project takes over the Sha Aqueduct. The Government realizes the \nimportance of water supply to the lake and will ensure its uninterrupted flow by coordinating the \nimplementation of both undertakings. \n \n61.  The variety in project investments will limit its financial and economic risks. The water \ntreatment, supply, and infrastructure investments will use established technologies and designs. \nSimilarly, the reforestation subprojects will use indigenous species and modern techniques. The \nbiodiversity  conservation  activities  have  been  designed  and  will  be  implemented  in  close \nconsultation with local communities. Therefore, the overall project risk is low. \n \n4.  Sustainability \n \n62.  The Project\u2019s overall sustainability is assured as 19 of the 22 subprojects will generate \nrevenues and become financially viable. The other three subprojects\u2014IWM, SWM, and UFM\u2014 \nwill also generate considerable benefits, and their respective IAs will be able to provide for \nappropriate  operation  and  maintenance.  Therefore,  the  overall  fiscal  implications  for  the \nGovernment will be limited. The single largest subproject, SWM (with 23% of the project cost), \nwill  clean  up  prime  urban  land  and  turn  it  into  eco-theme  park\u2014encouraging  urban  and \nindustrial development on its periphery. Similarly, WTPs and WSSs (39% of the project cost) \nand CED (7% of the project cost) will generate adequate revenues to pay for the operation as \n ", "20 \nwell as investment costs. All the IAs are financially sound and fully responsible for the effective \noperation of project infrastructure.  \n \nB.  Social Dimensions \n \n1.  Social Benefits \n \n63.   In Baiyangdian Basin, the ecosystem plays an important role in poverty reduction. \nConversely, poverty has a detrimental impact on the lake\u2019s ecosystem. There are 39 in-lake \nvillages and another 44 around the lake. About 200,000 people live in the in-lake villages, and \nas many live in its peripheral zones. The in-lake households are the poorest of the poor in the \nwhole basin, with per capita annual income of CNY627 ($90)\u2014Hebei government has listed 24 \nof the 39 in-lake villages as \u201cpoverty villages\u201d. However, the in-lake villages are depopulating at \nthe rate of 0.7%/annum, as young people migrate to nearby towns in search of better jobs in the \nnonfarm sectors. The in-lake villages are also the most polluted as they often dispose of their \nsolid and animal waste and domestic wastewater directly into the lake. Many make a living by \nrunning duck/fish farms on the lake, which create further pollution with animal feed and waste.   \n \n64.  Rural  poor,  both  in-lake  and  mountain  communities,  who  earn  subsistence  from \necosystem-based  activities,  are  most  vulnerable  to  the  loss  of  such  resources.  Given  the \npersistent  trend  of  out-migration  of  males  to  urban  areas,  these  sources  of  income  are \npredominantly supported by women and children. This includes undertaking small-scale fish \nfarming, livestock rearing, and collecting ecosystem products, i.e., reeds, that may be sold for \ncash. The Project has ensured that needs and concerns voiced by local communities, especially \nwomen, are reflected in the design and implementation arrangements of all its components. \nModalities will be adopted to ensure that women benefit from the employment opportunities \ngenerated by the Project. In addition, the Project will work\u2014through its GEF component\u2014with \nselected communities to (i) describe site-specific contributing factors to the degradation of the \necosystem; (ii) formulate environmentally-friendly solutions to the identified problems, with focus \non those that offer opportunities for revenue generation; and (iii) pilot test selected projects that \nlead to environmental improvement and revenue generation. The outcome of the component will \nbe to improve living standards; reduce livelihood dependency on the ecosystem; and contribute \nto  water  demand  management,  pollution  control,  and  conservation  of  natural  resources. \nThrough  the  CED  subproject,  the  Project  has  taken  the  initiative  to  apply  the  Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism to earn carbon credits. In line with the Project\u2019s social development \nobjective, Xiong County has agreed to share 50% of the carbon credit revenues with the Xiong \nCounty poverty reduction agency to expand its activities. This will be an incremental amount \nover and above the prevailing budget of the Agency. The summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy is in Appendix 13 and the gender and social action plan is in Appendix 14. \n \n  2.  Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n \n65.   The RPs have been prepared for 17 subprojects; the other five subprojects will not \nrequire any resettlement. Most of the RPs are classified category B impacts, whereby less than \n200  persons  will  be  seriously  affected.  Permanent  land  acquisition  for  the  total  Project  is \nestimated to be 293 ha, of which 71 ha is farmland; this will cause partial land loss (20% on \naverage) for 4,508 persons. The IWM subproject will have the largest impact and affect 2,770 \npersons (nearly 50% of the total affected persons). However, even for this subproject, the \nresettlement impacts will not be serious and the income loss can be restored through cash \ncompensation and improved irrigation. In total, the Project will require the displacement of only \n13 houses with 49 persons, who will be compensated and relocated nearby. Nine enterprises \nwill also be affected, but only two small private enterprises need to be totally relocated. Each \n ", "21 \nenterprise will be compensated and workers will not be adversely affected. The RPs have also \naddressed the temporary impacts caused during construction to 145 ha land (of which 27 ha is \nfarmland) and 1,700 persons. For the construction of water supply and wastewater pipeline \nnetworks, mitigation measures will be taken to avoid or minimize disturbance to residents and \nshops. Compensation will be provided if disturbance causes direct impact or extends beyond \n2 weeks. Local officials, village leaders, and affected persons were closely consulted during the \nfeasibility study stage to avoid or minimize adverse impacts and to formulate compensation and \nrehabilitation measures. The estimated cost of land acquisition and resettlement is $48.5 million \n(including contingencies, taxes, and fees), 18% of the total project cost. \n \n66.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of  resettlement  planning, \nsupervision, monitoring, and reporting. The IAs will be responsible for implementing the RPs, \nfinancing the costs, and internal reporting to the PMO. The IAs have disclosed resettlement \ninformation booklets. The RPs will be distributed to the relevant townships and made accessible \nto affected villagers, and the RPs have been uploaded to the ADB website. Since these RPs are \nbased on feasibility studies, they will have to be rechecked and, where necessary, updated \nbased on the final design, disclosed to APs, and resubmitted to ADB for approval prior to the \nstart of civil works. The summary resettlement plan is in Appendix 15. \n \n67.  National consultancy services are required for the external monitoring and evaluation of \nresettlement implementation. This will be financed by each IA but will be supervised by the \nPMO. A domestic institute, acceptable to ADB, will be engaged by the PMO (terms of reference \nare in Supplementary Appendix G). ADB requirements for resettlement monitoring are stipulated \nin the RPs and included in the loan covenants. \n \n  3.  Environmental Impact \n \n68.  The overall project classification is category A because of the expected impact of the \nIWM and SWM subprojects. Environmental impact assessment (EIA) for these two and initial \nenvironmental  examination  for  the  other  20  subprojects  were  prepared.  Based  on  these \nanalyses, a consolidated summary environmental impact assessment (SEIA) was prepared and \ncirculated to the Board of Directors, and uploaded on the ADB website on 1 June 2007. The \nanalysis indicates that, by integrating ecosystem and water resources management, the Project \nwill have a significant positive environmental impact on Baiyangdian Basin\u2014especially the lake. \nPotential  negative  environmental  impacts  associated  with  some  subprojects  have  been \nidentified and can be mitigated to the point that there are no potentially significant residual \nenvironmental impacts. Appropriate mitigation measures and environmental management and \nmonitoring  plans  have  been  prepared.  The  appropriate  alternative  analysis  and  public \nconsultation have been conducted. The possible adverse environmental impacts associated \nwith the subprojects will be prevented or minimized to an acceptable level if the EMP set out in \nthe SEIA (Supplementary Appendix H) is implemented effectively.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n \n69.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, Hebei provincial government, \nand BMG have given specific assurances which are incorporated in the legal documents.19 \n \n                                                 \n19 The full list of assurances is included in the loan and project agreements. \n ", "22 \nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  Baiyangdian Lake in Hebei Province is the largest remaining regulated freshwater body \nin the northern part of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The lake lies in the middle reaches \nof  the  Daqing  River  basin  and  discharges  into  the  Bohai  Gulf,  Yellow  Sea.  Much  of  the \nBaiyangdian Basin, totaling 31,500 square kilometers (km2) lies within Baoding Municipality and \nall of the lake body is located in its two Anxin and Xiong counties (Map 1). Historically, the lake \nserved many environmental and economic purposes and was described as the \u201ckidney\u201d of the \nnorthern PRC. Because of its strategic position as a sink in the Daiqing River basin, the lake is a \ncritical floodwater retention, rainfall inflows, and surface runoffs for about 72% of the basin\u2019s \narea.  Specifically,  it  regulates  floodwater  discharges  and  moderates  waterlogging.  It  also \ntransports nutrients that help contribute to the purification of water and the regeneration of \nnutrients. The lake is also economically important, especially for the more than 200,000 people \nliving in and around the lake\u2019s wetlands, providing them with their main sources of livelihood \n(e.g., freshwater  fishery,  reed  production,  and  tourism  services);  water  for  drinking  and \nirrigation; and major transportation routes. The open water and aquatic beds of the lake serve \nas spawning grounds and feeding habitats for a diverse array of fish and other animal species. \nAs a large body of water, the lake also moderates the local and regional temperature and thus \nhas an effect on the microclimate of its surroundings. \n \n2.  The  lake  and  its  upper  watershed  in  the  Taiheng  mountains  support  significant \nbiodiversity of regional and global significance within the Daqing River basin. The lake and its \nassociated wetlands are primarily important as a refueling site for migratory birds on the East \nAsian\u2013Australasian flyway. Seven globally-threatened bird species are regularly sighted in the \narea. The Taiheng mountains, which contain most of the last remaining secondary forests in \nBaoding Municipality, support a wide range of rare and endemic animals such as the brown-\neared pheasant Crossoptilon mantchuricum, grey-sided thrush Turdus feae, leopard Panthera \npardus, and golden takin Budorcas taxicolor. The Taiheng mountains are also recognized as a \ncenter of plant endemism in the PRC.  \n \n3.  In  the  last  4  decades,  many  functions  and  values  of  the  lake  have  been  eroded. \nConstruction of over 90 reservoirs (4 of them large) in the upstream has led to a dramatic \ndecline in water inflows and surface runoffs into the lake, from an average of 1.73 billion cubic \nmeters (m3) of water discharging into the lake in the 1960s, down to 0.065 billion m3 in 2002. \nSediment load had also decreased from 7.1 billion m3 in the 1960s to just 1.0 billion m3 by 1999.  \n \n4.  Increased water demand for irrigation, industry, energy, and residential uses has been a \nmajor reason for the construction of these reservoirs. With the demand for water exceeding \nsupply in the Daqing River basin, the frequencies of no or low inflows to the lake have become \nmore acute, especially during \u201cdry\u201d years. To compound existing water demands, population \ngrowth and expanded agricultural and industrial activities in the upstream and within the lake \nareas have increased wastewater discharges, pollutants, and sediments from these sectors into \nthe lake. It is estimated that half of the pollution sources originate from upstream, while the other \nhalf comes from the more than 200,000 people living in and around the lake.  \n \n5.  A body of water is assessed to be polluted when the water does not meet the criteria \nrequired for its designated use or function. Water pollutants can be chemical, physical, or \nbiological  in  nature.  In  the  PRC,  water  uses  are  classified  in  five  categories:  (i)  class  I, \nheadwaters of major rivers and water bodies in nature reserves; (ii) class II, centralized water \nsupply (level I), habitats of endangered and rare species, and spawning and feeding grounds of \n ", "   Appendix 3  29   \nfish; (iii) class III, centralized water supply (level II),  fish wintering grounds, routes of migratory \nspecies, aquaculture areas, and swimming areas; (iv) class IV, industrial use, and non-direct-\ncontact water-based recreation; and (v) class V, for irrigation and landscaping. There is an \nongoing program to classify/reclassify water bodies such as rivers, lakes, reservoirs, oceans, \netc.  according  to  type  of  functional  use,  based  on  a  set  of  criteria  that  will  be  applied \nconsistently nationwide. Baiyangdian Lake, under the program, has been classified class III in \nview of its importance to migratory birds, potential for aquaculture, and human use. \n \n6.  National standards for assessing water quality contain 22 parameters which measure \nthe  presence  of  pollutants  such  as  biochemicals,  e.g.,  chemical  oxygen  demand  (COD), \nbiochemical oxygen demand (BOD), nitrogen, phosporus; heavy metals (e.g., mercury, lead, \nand chromium); and other toxic substances (i.e., cyanide, phenol, and coliform); as well as \nphysical factors such as temperature, pH, and turbidity (Table A3.1). \n \nTable A3.1: Major National Standards for Surface Water Quality (GB383-2002) (mg/L) \n \nParameter    Water Quality \n  Class I  Class II  Class III  Class IV  Class V \npH    6\u20139  6\u20139  6\u20139  6\u20139  6\u20139 \nSuspended Solis    \u2014   \u2014   \u2014   \u2014   \u2014  \nDissolved Oxygen   \u2265  90% saturation  6  5  3  2 \nBiochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)  \u2264  3  3  4  6  10 \nChemical Oxygen Demand (COD)  \u2264  15  15  20  30  40 \nOrganic Phosphorous (P)  \u2264  \u2014   \u2014   \u2014   \u2014   \u2014  \nTotal Phosphorous (TP)  \u2264  0.02  0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4 \nAmmonia Nitrogen (NH -N)  \u2264  0.15  0.5  1.0  1.5  2.0 \n3\nNitrate Nitrogen  \u2264  \u2014   \u2014   \u2014   \u2014   \u2014  \nTotal Nitrogen (N)  \u2264  0.2  0.5  1.0  1.5  2.0 \nPhenol  \u2264  0.002  0.002  0.005  0.01  0.1 \nTotal Dissolved Solid (TDS)  \u2264  \u2014   \u2014   \u2014   \u2014   \u2014  \nFecal Coliform   \u2264  200  2,000  10,000  20,000  400,000 \nChlorine Residual  \u2264  \u2014   \u2014   \u2014   \u2014   \u2014  \n\u2014 = no standard exists or guideline is not specified. \nNote: In the People\u2019s Republic of China, there are two water classifications; one describes functions and the other \nquality. \nSource: 2007 project feasibility study. \n \n7.  Oxygen-consuming organic matter measured in COD and BOD is the most common \nwater pollutant in the PRC. Other common pollutants are nutrients that contribute to excessive \ngrowth of algae and other water plants which, in turn, deplete the water's oxygen supply. The \nmajor parameters for measuring nutrients are ammonia nitrogen (NH -N) and total phosphorous \n3\n(TP). The annual occurrence of fish kills since the early 1990s reflects the presence of high \nlevels of nutrients in the lake. \n \nB.  Status of Pollution in the Baiyangdian Basin \n \n8.  Water pollution and degradation of the ecosystem in the lake have accelerated in the \nlast two decades because of continued pressure from rapid economic growth, resulting in \nindustrialization and urbanization. The current water quality in most of the urban inland rivers \nhas been assessed class V or worse, and large-scale fish kills have occurred in the lake every \nyear  since  the  early  1990s.  The  situation  is  aggravated  by  lack  of  wastewater  treatment \nfacilities,  with  large  quantities  of  untreated  industrial  and  domestic  wastewater  directly \ndischarged into rivers and other tributaries. This has subsequently resulted in the deterioration \nin the quality of water meant for domestic use. The lake, in fact, consists of several lakes with \nwater quality falling classes in IV\u2013V of the Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Water of \nthe PRC as shown in Table A3.2. \n ", "30         Appendix 3   \n \nTable A3.2: Water Quality of the Major Lakes in Baiyangdian \n \nWater Quality  Major Pollutants Exceeding \nMonitoring Section  Existing Water Quality Class \nTarget Class  the Required Limits \nShaochedian  IV  III \nZhaolindian  IV  III \nWangjiazhai  IV  III \nQuantou  IV  III \nDuancun   IV  III  BOD COD, NH -N, TP \n,  3\nCaiputai   IV  III \nGuangdianzhangzhua  IV  III \nNanliuzhuang  Below V  IV \nGudingdian  Not available  V \nBOD = biochemical oxygen demand, COD = chemical oxygen demand, NH -N = ammonia nitrogen, TP = total \n3\nphosphorous. \nSource:  2007 project feasibility study. \n  \nC.  Sources of Pollution in the Baiyangdian Basin \n \n9.  There are three main sources of pollution in the basin: (i) point sources, including urban \nand industrial wastewater; (ii) nonpoint sources that include agricultural and urban storm water \nrunoff, and livestock wastes; and (iii) in-lake pollution sources, including domestic wastewater \nand leachate from wastes generated by in-lake villages, in-lake fish farms, and tourism.  \n \n10.  Total annual pollution loads generated by all sources (i.e., point, nonpoint, and in-lake) \nare estimated at about 633,635 tons/year of COD, 92,741 tons/year of ammonia nitrogen, and \n46,929 tons/year of total phosphorous. A large proportion of the total pollution load is produced \nby in-lake sources such as in-lake villages, fish and duck farms, and in-lake tourism. About \n60.7% of COD, 59.3% of ammonia nitrogen, and 91.6% of total phosphorous produced by the \nin-lake sources reach the lake. A significant proportion of the total COD (about 31.5%) and \nammonia  nitrogen  (about  43%)  produced  by  point  sources  likewise  reach  the  lake.  The \nproportion of pollution loads, by type of source, reaching the lake are in Table A3.3. \n \nTable A3.3: Pollution Load Reaching Baiyangdian Lake by Source \nAmmonia Total\nCOD Nitrogen Phosporous\nSource (%) (%) (%)\nA.

The Environmental Protection Plans and the Project \n \n12.  A total of 27 wastewater treatment plants are proposed under the water pollution control \ncomponent of the 11th Five-Year Environmental Protection Plan. Under this plan, it is expected \nthat all the urban sewage generated by Baoding City and about 60% of 22 other cities and \ncounties will be treated by 2010. Baoding municipal government (BMG) is also making efforts, \nthrough its Baoding Ecosystem Rehabilitation Master Plan, to mitigate existing water pollution \nproblems. It expects to achieve its wastewater management objectives set for 2010, which \ninclude attaining class III water quality in the lake and class IV water quality in urban inland \nrivers. The master plan calls for installing 23 wastewater treatment plants in the counties, cities, \nand towns surrounding and upstream of the lake with a total capacity of 665,000 m3/day. Of \nthese, 13 wastewater treatment plants, with a total capacity of about 340,000 m3/day, are \ncovered under this Project and account for 51% of the planned capacity.   \n \n13.  This Project, therefore, significantly complements the initiatives under the 11th Five-Year \nEnvironmental Protection Plan and those under the master plan. The Project will enable BMG to \nachieve its wastewater management objectives set for 2010. \n \n  \n ", "32  Appendix 4 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \nDonor  Project Title  Year  Amount \n($ million)

The biodiversity conservation activities under the Global Environment Facility (GEF) \ncomponent will be organized in six modules. The summary description is provided below. More \ndetailed and specific description of these interventions is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n2.  Module  1,  Protected  Area  Management.  Biodiversity  management  and  monitoring \nfunctions will be strengthened in the two provincial nature reserves (PNRs), i.e., the Jin Hua \nShan-Heng Lingzi Shan and Baiyangdian Lake Rare Bird PNRs (Map 7). Specific actions will \ninclude (i) training of at least five managers and 10\u201315 additional staff in each of the two PNRs, \n(ii) formation  of  community  management  groups  in  communities  adjacent  to  each  PNR, \n(iii) preparation  of  biodiversity  management  plans,  (iv)  development  and  implementation  of \nregular biodiversity monitoring programs, (v) more effective biodiversity management over the \n700  square  kilometer  (km2)  area  of  both  PNRs,  and  (vi)  steps  taken  to  pursue  listing  of \nBaiyangdian as a Ramsar Wetland of International Importance. \n \n3.  Module 2, Habitat Enhancement and Rehabilitation. A variety of pilot activities will be \nimplemented  to  improve  the  quality  and/or  extent  of  important  wildlife  habitats.  For  the \nBaiyangdian Rare Bird PNR, these will include (i) constructed wetlands to increase habitat area \nand reduce discharge of nonpoint source pollutants to the lake, (ii) demonstration of composting \ntoilets for \u201cin-lake\u201d and lakeside communities\u2014to reduce nonpoint source pollution and provide \ncompost for farm use, (iii) establishment of test areas to improve migratory bird resting and \nfeeding islands, and (iv) removal of excess silt from the lake through appropriately scaled \ncommunity-based initiatives. Demonstration of integrated pest management will be set up to \nreduce production costs and reliance on agricultural chemicals. For the Jin Hua Shan-Heng \nLingzi Shan PNR, the preferred vegetation cover for the hemaji and other rare bird species will \nbe increased or restored in areas that have been deforested or otherwise damaged through \nhuman activity. Four to five demonstration activities will be established for pollution reduction \nwithin the Baiyangdian Lake environs. Habitat enhancement will be undertaken in both PNRs, \ncovering an area equivalent to at least 5% of the total designated core conservation areas.  \n \n4.  Module 3, Eco-Friendly Livelihoods. Steps will be taken to improve environmental \nbenefits  of  livelihood  activities  that  are  dependent  on  natural  resources  within  the  basin. \nEcotourism training will be provided to small operators to improve visitors\u2019 appreciation for \nbiodiversity  and  natural  ecosystem  values.  Technical  support  will  be  provided  to  Baoding \nTourism Bureau and county bureaus to prepare ecotourism master plans. Reed producers in \nthe lake and gatherers of non-timber forest products in the upper watershed will be trained to \nadopt improved methods of planting, harvesting, and processing so that impacts on habitats and \nnatural resources are minimized. Value-adding for these products will increase income while \nreducing pressure on natural resources. Six demonstration activities of improved livelihoods will \nbe undertaken relating to eco-tourism; and an additional six relating to harvesting, processing, \nand  marketing  of  natural  products.  A  tourism  master  plan  will  be  drafted  for  Baoding \nMunicipality. At least two trial eco-certification programs will be initiated, one each for tourism \nand natural products-based activities. A credit facility will be established to support sustainable \nlivelihood options, especially among the poorest segment of the target beneficiary group. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  35 \n5.  Module  4,  Sustainable  Financing.  Mechanisms  for  self-financing  of  required \nenvironmental and biodiversity management services in both PNRs will be supported. Technical \nassistance will be provided to work with county authorities, as well as with other responsible \nagencies (e.g., Yesanpo Scenic and Cultural Heritage Area management committee in the \nupper  catchment  basin)  to  develop  appropriate  financing  structures  (e.g.,  user  fees,  cost \nsharing, or trust fund), based primarily on tourism revenue streams.  \n \n6.  Module  5,  Awareness.  Promoting  awareness  in  the  basin  will  ensure  long-term \nsustainability of biodiversity conservation. Awareness and participation of communities around \nboth PNRs will be strengthened by (i) integrating biodiversity conservation lessons into curricula \nfor at least 5% of all primary and secondary schools within the rural counties of Baoding \nMunicipality; (ii) providing mobile outreach facilities (e.g., fully equipped vans or minibuses, with \nsmall  libraries,  audiovisual  displays,  interactive  exhibits,  etc.)  to  reach  poor,  remote \ncommunities  around  both  PNRs;  (iii)  developing  a  Baiyangdian  biodiversity  website; \n(iv) developing feedback and monitoring mechanisms to measure and improve the effectiveness \nof awareness campaigns; and (v) providing materials and technical assistance to establish a \nwetlands learning center at the lake, including exhibits, signage, walkways, and boardwalks. \nNotes and pamphlets\u2014on effective new policy measures, lessons learned, and best practices\u2014\nwill be prepared and published for distribution especially for high-ranking decision makers in the \nGovernment and executives in the private sector. All such material will also be posted on the \nproject website for public access.     \n \n7.  Module  6,  Integrated  Ecosystem  Management.  Activities  will  be  integrated  by \n(i) strengthening basin-wide institutional coordination mechanisms, especially through regular \ncoordination meetings; (ii) increasing involvement and strengthening of local nongovernment \norganizations; (iii) improving capabilities for integrated, basin-wide monitoring of biodiversity, \nsurface water flow, water quality, and other critical ecosystem parameters; and (iv) establishing \na biodiversity and wetlands database as part of a basin-wide geographic information system \nclearinghouse  that  will  serve  as  a  resource  for  future  planning  and  management  decision \nmaking.  \n \n ", "36         Appendix 7 \nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  Water pollution and ecosystem degradation in Baiyangdian Basin have accelerated in the \nlast 2 decades because of continued pressure from rapid economic growth, industrialization, and \nurbanization. The degradation of the lake has diminished livelihood opportunities for communities \nliving in the lake\u2019s surrounding areas and has put them at risk from various types of diseases. \nAdding to the current problems is the weak capacity of county governments to implement and \nenforce environmental policies and safeguards to conserve the biodiversity of the basin. \n \n2.  The Project will support Baoding municipal government (BMG) and participating county \ngovernments in abating the continuing pollution and degradation in the lake and its river network as \nwell as in rehabilitating its ecosystem in line with the priorities of the national, provincial, and \nmunicipal governments. The proposed Project is part of the first phase under the Baiyangdian \nEcosystem Rehabilitation Master Plan, which calls for an integrated effort to reduce pollution loads \nin  the  lake  and  rehabilitate  the  ecosystems  in  the  basin,  with  a  planned  investment  of  over \n$1.0 billion. This Project is to have a demonstration effect for future undertakings. \n \nB.  Scope of Services \n \n3.  BMG, through Baoding Development and Reform Commission (BDRC), is the Executing \nAgency (EA) for the Project. Consulting services are required to support the project management \noffice (PMO) at BDRC and the project implementation units (PIUs) of the respective implementing \nagencies (IAs), to provide project management support and build capacity for integrated ecosystem \nand water resource management.  \n \n4.  A consulting firm will be engaged by the EA to provide technical assistance to the PMO and \nPIUs throughout project implementation. In general, the consulting services will (i) support the PMO \nin project management, and (ii) advise and train the PMO and PIUs in the technical aspects of the \nProject.  In  particular,  the  consultant  will  develop  approaches,  procedures,  and  guidelines  for \nimplementing key project activities. The consultant will also provide assistance to concerned BMG \nand  county  agencies  in  various  aspects  of  project  implementation,  including,  among  others, \ncommunity  organization,  livelihood  demonstration,  environmental  monitoring,  institutional \nstrengthening, gender and development, and project monitoring and evaluation, as necessary. \n \n5.  The  Project  will  finance  two  consulting  packages.  Package  A,  for  236  person-months, \nfinanced under the loan, will comprise three international experts for 25 person-months and 14 \nnational  experts  for  211  person-months  (Table  A7).  Unallocated  inputs  (2  person-months  of \ninternational and 11 person-months of national experts) are provided to be used for unidentified \nshort-term specialists whose services may be required in the course of project implementation. A \nconsulting firm will be engaged to provide these services. The PMO will be responsible for the \nselection, contract negotiations, and contract management. Package B, financed under the Global \nEnvironment Facility (GEF) grant, for 180 person-months, will comprise eight international experts \nfor 38 person-months and nine national experts for 142 person-months. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) will recruit the firm, and the PMO will negotiate and manage the contract. In selecting \nthese firm(s), quality and cost-based selection (80:20) will be used and the short-listed firms will be \nrequired to submit full technical proposals. All recruitment will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n \n  \n ", "  Appendix 7  37\nTable A7: Consulting Packages \n(person-months) \n \nProject Consultants Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Total\nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Project aims to improve quality of life in Baiyangdian Basin through sustainable \nmanagement of its ecosystem and water resources. It will support a number of interventions \nunder four complementing components: (i) 22 subproject investments of 7 different categories\u2014\n13 wastewater treatment plants (WTPs); 3 water supply systems (WSSs); 2 reforestation; and \none each for clean energy development (CED), urban flood management (UFM), integrated \nwater management (IWM), and solid waste management (SWM); (ii) ecosystem management \nand  biodiversity  conservation  that  will  also  demonstrate  innovative  alternative  livelihoods; \n(iii) institutional  strengthening  by  providing  training  for  integrated  ecosystem  and  water \nmanagement, and increasing environmental awareness; and (iv) project management support \nby providing technical expertise for effective implementation of related interventions. \n \n2.  The  main  project  benefits  will  be  generated  from  the  implementation  of  the \n22 subprojects. WTPs will treat the affluent from domestic, industrial, and commercial users and \nsignificantly reduce organic pollution loading to the lake as well as improve the water quality in \nthe extensive network of rivers in the basin. WSSs will increase the potable water supply and \nimprove hygiene among project beneficiaries. Aside from financial benefits, WTPs and WSSs \nare expected to generate significant health and environmental benefits. Reforestation and forest \nconservation in Angezhuang Reservoir and the lakeside areas will improve the water retention \ncapacity of the watershed and contain soil erosion. These interventions will also conserve \nbiodiversity; and improve the ecosystem, living conditions, and livelihoods of the subproject \ncommunities. The CED subproject will exploit geothermal energy as an alternative to using coal \nfor providing space-heating to domestic, commercial, and industrial consumers; and contribute \nto energy cost savings as well as reductions in emission of air pollutants, with positive impacts \non the environment and health of affected communities. The UFM subproject is expected to \nsignificantly  reduce  damage  to  public  and  private  infrastructure  as  well  as  to  agricultural \nproduction caused by flooding, which has increased in frequency in recent years. The IWM \nsubproject will divert water from the Wangkuai to Xidayang reservoir through a new diversion \nchannel  to  provide  an  ensured  and  increased  amount  of  water  to  the  lake;  recharge \nsubterranean  water  sources  during  low  watertable  periods,  significantly  reduce  water \nconveyance losses compared to the alternative route, and improve water supply and quality in \nand around Baoding City and Li County. The cleanup of Huanghuangou River, under the SWM \nsubproject, will also improve water retention capacity, environment, and contain soil erosion. \nThese interventions will also conserve biodiversity and improve the ecosystem, living conditions, \nand livelihoods in the basin. \n \n3.  Benefits from the interventions under the biodiversity conservation component will be \nderived from improved wildlife and overall environmental conditions in the basin in general and \nin the provincial nature reserve areas in particular. However, these benefits are difficult to \nquantify and, therefore, are not included in the financial and economic analysis. \n \nB.  Major Assumptions \n \n4.  Financial Analysis.  The analysis is based on information and data provided by the \nrelevant feasibility study reports carried out by the Government as well as information provided \nby the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA). The specific assumptions applied in the \nanalysis are as follows:  \n \n  ", "50         Appendix 12 \n(i)  The  analysis  focuses  on  19  revenue-generating  subprojects\u2014WTPs,  WSSs, \nCED, and reforestation\u2014and assesses financial sustainability by calculating their \nindividual financial internal rates of return (FIRRs).   \n(ii)  Estimates  of  revenues,  capital  investment  costs,  and  operating  costs  are \nexpressed in yuan in 2007 constant prices. Tariffs used in the analysis are based \non  prevalent  rates  and  below  the  willingness-to-pay  threshold  of  potential \nbeneficiaries, which was derived through a household survey conducted during \nthe PPTA. The tariffs and price of timber used in the analysis are conservative \nestimates. \n(iii)  Subproject-specific FIRRs are based on (a) with- and without-project incremental \nrevenues derived from tariff charges for providing services related to wastewater, \nwater supply, and clean energy and from revenues from sales of timber and \ntourist entrance fees; as well as (b) incremental costs incurred in subproject \ninvestment and operation and maintenance. A projection period of 25 years is \nassumed.   \n(iv)  Subproject-specific FIRRs are calculated after taxes. The sales tax rates are \nassumed  at  7%  and  income  tax  rates  are  assumed  at  33%.  The  weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC) for the investment subprojects is estimated to be \n2.3% (Table A12.1). \n \nTable A12.1: Calculation of Weighted Average Cost of Capital   \nUnit ADB PRCG CGs APCF  EI Total\nA.

Economic Analysis. The economic analysis mainly determines the incremental benefits \nand costs from the 22 subprojects which, aside from those mentioned above, include UFM, \nIWM, and SWM subprojects. The economic analysis is carried out for each subproject, and for \nthe Project as a whole, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.1 \nSpecific assumptions used are as follows: \n \n(i)  The project life is assumed 25 years, including an implementation period of 5 \nyears. Financial revenues and costs are expressed in 2007 constant prices.   \n(ii)  All  taxes  and  subsidies  are  excluded  from  the  economic  evaluation  of  the \nindividual subprojects and the Project as a whole.  \n(iii)  Economic costs and benefits are derived by adjusting financial costs and benefits \nby a standard conversion factor of 0.93. This is consistent with the standard \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1997. Gudelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.

Results of the Financial Analysis \n \n6.  The financial analysis is undertaken for each of the subproject investments based on its \nrespective  revenue  and  cost  streams  estimated  over  a  25-year  projection  period.  Annual \nrevenue for each WTP and WSS subproject is calculated based on its specified operating \ncapacity multiplied by applicable tariff charged to different types of consumers (Table A12.2). \nAnnual revenues of about CNY37.25 million/year generated by the CED subproject are derived \nfrom space-heating of (i) about 1.65 million square meters (m2) of all types of buildings at \nCNY14/m2,3 (ii) about 0.53 million m2 of public baths and swimming pools at CNY10/m2, (iii) \nabout 0.1 million m2 of hotel facilities at CNY10/m2, and (iv) drinking water supply of about \n250,000 m3 at CNY5/m3. About 2,000 hectares (ha) of the Angezhuang Reservoir area will be \nplanted with fast-growing and high-yielding trees at a rate of 900 trees/ha, with a yield of about \n0.4  cubic  meters  (m3)/tree.  Annual  revenue  generated  by  the  Angezhuang  reforestation \nsubproject will mainly be derived from an annual harvest of about 200 ha of reforested area. \nRevenue of about CNY29.15 million/year is projected to start in year 10 at 80% capacity, \ngradually increasing to about CNY36.44 million/year at full development in year 12 with timber \nsales of about 72,882 m3/year and sold at a price of CNY500/m3. The Baiyangdian lakeside \nreforestation  subproject  will  mainly  provide  shelter  belts  around  the  lake  to  protect \nembankments, main channels, and villages as well as improve the general landscape of the \narea to encourage tourism. Revenues totalling about CNY12.44 million/year are expected to be \ngenerated from (i) sale of timber of about 15,888 m3/year, harvested annually from about 44 ha \nat full development in year 14 and sold at a market price of CNY500/m3; and (ii) fees charged to \ntourists totalling about CNY4.5 million annually.  \n \nTable A12.2: Water Supply and Wastewater Tariffs (CNY/m3) \n \nSubproject Domestic Industrial Commercial\nWater Supply\nYi County 2.11\nXiong County 1.60 2.50 3.00\nDingzhou City 1.70 2.60 3.10\nWastewater Treatment Tariff ranges from CNY0.72 to CNY1.30/m3 \nm3 = cubic meter. \nSource: 2007 project feasibility study. \n \n7.  The  CED  subproject  may  quality  for  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism  and  earn \ncarbon credits. Over the first 3 years, the subproject may generate carbon credits of about \nCNY10.0 million/year based on a contracted price of $12/ton with the Asia Pacific Carbon Fund \n(APCF). Half of the revenues earned during this period will be utilized to pay back APCF for its \nCNY12.6 million upfront financing. Beyond the third year, carbon credit revenues will increase to \nabout  CNY43.4  million/year.  In  line  with  the  Project\u2019s  social  development  objective,  Xiong \nCounty has agreed to share 50% of the carbon credit revenues with the Xiong County poverty \nreduction agency to expand its activities. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006.

Results of the Economic Analysis \n \n10.  Wastewater  Treatment  and  Water  Supply  Subprojects.  The  national  policy  for \npollution  control  endorses  the  use  of  cost-effective  wastewater  management  measures  to \nachieve overall treatment targets. At the same time, the investment must be able to generate \ngreater economic benefits than the economic costs it has incurred. Therefore, two approaches \nare used to evaluate the economic viability of WTPs. The first is based on the basic requirement \nthat the technology chosen for each investment be a least-cost option while the second is based \non the criterion that the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of that option be greater than the \nopportunity cost of capital of 12%. The least-cost analysis for each of the WTPs indicated that \nthe chosen technology exhibited the least cost compared with other technologies available.  \n  \n ", "                                                                                                                       Appendix 12  53 \n \n11.  Without the Project, untreated wastewater is drained into the river network of the basin \nleading  to  the  lake.  In  the  process,  pollutants  permeate  the  ground  and  contaminate  the \nsubterranean water that communities use for drinking. Most often, the untreated wastewater, \nmixed  with  irrigation  water,  is  also  distributed  over  extensive  agricultural  areas\u2014causing \nsignificant soil pollution and degradation. In project sites where existing water supply facilities \nare inadequate, communities contend with drinking water that is below the standards of the \nNational Sanitary Criteria for Domestic Drinking Water. These problems have resulted in serious \nhealth  problems,  particularly  frequent  occurrence  of  stomach  and  intestinal  diseases  and \nhepatitis, which were verified by extensive surveys of affected households in the project area \nundertaken by the PPTA. About 1.12 million people or about 416,000 households (or about 25% \nof the total population living within the wastewater drainage area) are affected by domestic and \nindustrial effluents, while another 260,000 people or about 65,000 households are in need of \nimproved water supply facilities. All these households will benefit from the WTPs and WSSs to \nbe established under this Project.  \n \n12.  The \u201ccost of illness\u201d approach was used to estimate the benefits of WTPs and WSSs \ninvestments. Improvements in drinking water have been found to decrease the incidence rate of \nstomach and intestinal diseases by 5% and hepatitis A by 0.6%. The cost of medical treatment \nfor  stomach  and  intestinal  diseases  is  estimated  at  CNY115/person/year  (about \nCNY107/person/year in economic terms); for treatment of hepatitis A, it is estimated at about \nCNY6,000/person/year (about CNY5,580/person/year in economic terms). With the projected \nlarge number of affected population in each of the subproject areas, the economic benefits \nresulting from reductions in medical costs are expected to be substantial. This is reflected in the \nestimated EIRRs for each of the WTPs (16.8\u201318.3%) and WSSs (17.6\u201318.6%), which are \nsignificantly greater than the opportunity cost of capital of 12% (Table A12.4).   \n \n13.  Reforestation Subprojects. About 10,000 ha of farmland in the upper watershed of \nBaiyangdian Lake in Yi County will be protected from soil erosion, particularly during the rainy \nmonths, with the reforestation of the Angezhuang Reservoir area. This, in turn, will benefit a \ntotal of about 18,7504 farm households, which are expected to avoid crop damages caused by \nsoil erosion at an estimated average annual cost of about CNY1,674/ha at the subproject\u2019s full \ndevelopment or an estimated total economic benefits of about CNY16.74 million/year. Economic \nbenefits  from  timber  sales  are  about  CNY34  million/year.  The  estimated  EIRR  for  the \nAngezhuang reforestation subproject, by evaluating the projected economic benefits against its \neconomic investment cost, is 16.4%. Revenues, mainly from timber sales and tourism, and \ncosts estimated for the Baiyangdian lakeside reforestation subproject, are also expressed in \neconomic terms in deriving the subproject EIRR estimated at 15.2%.  \n \n14.  Clean Energy Development Subproject. The use of geothermal water in Xiong County \nas an alternative to coal to provide space heating to residential, commercial, and industrial \nbuildings, will significantly reduce discharge of noxious gases and dust\u2014improving air quality \nand reducing the incidence of diseases, particularly respiratory diseases in the affected areas. \nThe subproject is expected to replace about 60,000 tons of coal annually. The CED subproject \nwill  provide  incremental  and  non-incremental  benefits.  The  non-incremental  portion  occurs \nbecause coal-based energy production will be replaced under the Project. Resultant resource \ncost savings were estimated and used as a benefit. Replacing coal with renewable resource \nalso reduces pollution. Benefits of reduced pollution were added to the resource cost savings. \nThe incremental benefits were not estimated because resource cost savings and environmental \n                                                 \n4   Average farm size is estimated at about 0.53 ha (about 8 mu). With a total area of 10,000 ha expected to be \nprotected from soil erosion by the subproject, total farm households are estimated to be about 18,750. \n  ", "54         Appendix 12 \nbenefits  adequately  justify  the  investment  on  this  subproject.  At  an  economic  cost  of \nCNY372/ton,  the  total  economic  benefit  accruing  to  energy  savings  is  estimated  at  about \nCNY22  million/year.  Reductions  in  sulfur  dioxide  (SO ) (about  1,000  tons/year)  and  total \n2  \nsuspended solids (about 500 tons/year) are likewise expected to be realized and will generate \ncorresponding economic benefits of about CNY1.67 million/year and CNY0.26 million/year. \nHealth benefits caused by lesser incidence of respiratory diseases are estimated at about \nCNY1.34  million/year.  Including  revenues,  expressed  in  economic  terms  of  about \nCNY34.64 million/year, the estimated subproject EIRR is about 23.6%. \n \nTable A12.4: Economic Analysis of Subprojects                          \nSwitching Value\nDecrease/\nDecrease Increase Increase in\nin Revenue in Cost Benefits/Costs\nBase to Maintain to Maintain to Maintain\nEIRRa 12% EIRR 12% EIRR 12% EIRR\nSubprojects (%) (%) (%) (%)\nA.

Urban  Flood  Management  Subproject.  The  construction  of  flood  management \ninfrastructure in Anxin County will reduce flood damage to agriculture, housing, and other public \nand private assets covering an area of about 14.31 square kilometres (km2) including about \n9,300 ha of farmland (about 5,000 farm households), about 1,152 m2 of residential facilities, \nabout 30 small enterprises, and the municipal facilities. Total economic benefits are estimated at \nabout CNY7.57 million/year or about CNY7.04 million in economic terms. The estimated EIRR \nfor the investment is 14.5%. \n \n16.  Integrated  Water  Management  Subproject.  The  IWM  subproject  will  construct  a \n14.6 km link-canal from the Wangkuai to Xidayang reservoir with a flow rate of 10 m3/second \n(Map 4). This is expected to reduce water losses currently incurred from diverting water through \nthe existing 9 km natural waterway, which have been estimated at about 20 million m3/year \nbecause of the high infiltration rate along the sandy route. At an economic price of about \nCNY1.4/m3, the estimated economic benefits caused by reduction in water losses is about \nCNY27.9  million/year.  The  reallocation  of  water,  by  releasing  excess  water  from  the  two \nreservoirs during the rainy season, will also enable the recharging of the Yimuquan aquifer with \nclean water to maintain pressure within the aquifer and prevent intrusion of polluted water from \nthe Caohe drainage area during low watertable levels. The mitigation of this problem will bring \nabout health benefits among affected communities accruing to reductions in the incidence of \nstomach and intestinal diseases, which are unlikely to occur without the Project. An estimated \n700,000 people in Baoding City and Li County are likely to benefit at a total economic value of \nabout CNY26.1 million/year. The estimated EIRR for the subproject is 18.9%. \n \n17.  Solid  Waste  Management  Subproject.  Rehabilitation  of  Huanghuangou  River  will \nsignificantly improve the environmental condition in the subproject area. About 0.6 million tons \nof solid waste, currently in the open field, will be disposed of in a sanitary landfill. The existing \nmoat will be dredged, from which about 50,000 m3 of sludge, highly polluted by industrial waste, \nwill be removed. This area has also been a dump for fly ash from a nearby coal-fired power \nplant, which is now adopting environmentally safe technology. Over 2 million tons of fly ash from \nits past operation will be safely removed for use in the construction of buildings and highways. \nOnce this waste have been removed, the subproject area will be landscaped. These activities \nwill significantly reduce dust pollution and contamination of surface and subterranean water with \nsignificant beneficial impacts on health and the environment affecting about half a million people \nin Baoding City. A conservative estimate of about 136,000 tons of dust, which annually affects \nBaoding City, will be reduced once the rehabilitation is complete. At a cost of about CNY0.52/ \nkilogram to reduce dust, the estimated economic benefits caused by dust reduction are about \nCNY70.83 million/year. Health benefits generated by reductions in the incidence of stomach and \nintestinal  diseases  due  to  contaminated  drinking  water  (about  CNY18.65  million/year)  and \nrespiratory ailments (about CNY4.19 million/year) are also expected to accrue to the subproject. \nThe subproject is expected to realize an EIRR of 18.9%.  \n \n18.  Economic  Analysis  of  the  Whole  Project.  The  estimated  overall  project  EIRR  is \n16.9% with an economic net present value of CNY1,462 million. Switching values indicate that, \nto maintain the project EIRR at 12%, benefits should not decline by more than 19%, and the \neconomic costs should not increase by more than 23%. A simultaneous decrease in benefits \nand increase in costs should be 10% or less. A 1-year delay in project benefits will result in an \nEIRR value of 13.7%. The analysis shows that the Project is economically viable and robust. \nDetailed financial and economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix I.    \n  ", "   56        Appendix 13             \n         \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \n \nDuring the 10th Five-Year Plan, 2001\u20132005, the population of extreme poverty in the country, by the Government\u2019s \ndefinition, was reduced from 32.1 million to 23.7 million; and that of low-income poor declined from 62.1 million to \n40.7 million, with the overall population of poor about 64 million. If the international poverty line of $1/day is applied, \nthe figure is significantly higher, at 246 million or about 18.8% of the total population. Experience in the PRC shows \nthat poverty is both a cause and effect of environmental degradation. The poor, lacking the daily necessities and \nbasic means of livelihood, are forced to overexploit often fragile ecosystems. On the other hand, the poor have \noften to bear the disproportionate impact of environmental pollution and ecological degradation. A sustainable \ndevelopment strategy has been included in the 11th Five-Year Plan, 2006\u20132010, which emphasizes a \u201cresource-\nefficient and environment-friendly, harmonious society\u201d by maintaining a balance between economic growth, \nsocioeconomic development, and environmental protection. The plan sets forth a series of environmental targets for \nurban environmental improvement, ecosystem rehabilitation, natural resources management, and mitigation of \nnatural disasters. \n \nThe poverty-environment linkage is pronounced in Baiyangdian Basin, where poverty is intertwined with the \ndegradation of natural resources and loss of biodiversity in the upper reaches characterized by deforestation, and in \nthe  middle  and  lower  reaches  by  water  shortage  and  environmental  pollution.  The  Project  will  support \nGovernment\u2019s efforts by tackling the root causes of poverty through the reduction of environmental pollution and \nrehabilitation of the ecosystems, by adopting an integrated ecosystem management approach. It will contribute to \nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for environmental sustainability (MDG 7), to halve the \nproportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by 2015 (MDG \ntarget 10).  Specific  interventions  include  wastewater  management,  water  supply,  reforestation,  watershed \nrehabilitation, better allocation of water resources, and use of cleaner energy and flood control. The poor will benefit \nfrom the Project as they are more exposed to flooding, health, and other impairments and do not have the income \nor other resources to cope with them. \n \nThe Project targets 11 counties/cities (Anxin, Baoding, Dingxing, Dingzhou, Gaobeidian City, Li, Mancheng, Tang, \nXiong, Xushui, and Yi) and two development zones (Wenquancheng, New and High Tech Development Zone). The \ndirect project area has a population of 1.09 million\u2014620,000 (57%) urban and 470,000 (43%) rural. In 2005, the \naverage annual disposal income per capita was CNY6,920 ($833) for urban areas and CNY3,380 ($407) for rural \nareas. The environmental and poverty reduction benefits will extend to the entire basin population of over 10 \nmillion. Therefore, the Project will be a key intervention in poverty reduction. \n \nThe health impact was analyzed during the project preparation. An order-of-magnitude analysis of the impact on \nmorbidity and mortality indicates that the Project may reduce incidence of waterborne diseases by an average of \n0.28 million cases/year. Most of these cases will not be serious enough to result in a medical consultation or \nreporting under the Government\u2019s disease surveillance programs. The reduced disease incidence is associated \nwith a reduction in loss of 1.4 million workdays/annum, with savings in medical costs and/or avoidance of lost \nearnings. \n \nThe Project will provide 13,200 person-years of work over the 5-year construction period. Project-related services, \nsuch as procurement of construction materials and equipment and follow-on multiplier effects for the regional \neconomy, are expected to create an additional 39,000 person-years of work. It is estimated that about 30% of the \nconstruction jobs will be filled by the poor and vulnerable, including unemployed persons, rural migrants, and \nwomen. Since unemployment is a major cause of poverty in the project area, the poor will benefit disproportionately \nfrom  this  job  creation.  Those  temporarily  employed  in  construction  will  benefit  from  additional  training  and \nexperience, which will provide them with opportunities in other infrastructure projects. Project operations will create \n580 full-time permanent jobs. While these are primarily skilled jobs in wastewater treatment, water supply, water \nresource management, and clean energy operations, they will require on-the-job training and will, therefore, be \navailable to unemployed workers who have basic technical training and experience from their previous work in \nstate-owned enterprises. \n \n  \n ", "                                                                                                                                              \n                                          Appendix 13            57 \n \n  B.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe project area consists of one state-designated poverty county (Tang); two province-designated poverty counties \n(Yi and Quyang); and four municipality-designated poverty counties (Anxin, Mancheng, Xiong, and Xushui). For \nrural areas, the absolute poverty line is CNY627 ($83) and the low-income poverty line is CNY628\u2013924 ($83\u2013122) \nper capita/annum. In Baoding Municipality, the absolute rural poor population is 90,000 and the low-income rural \npoor population is 495,000. Similarly, the poverty incidence rate is 1.1% for the absolute poor, or 7%, by including \nthe low-income poor  population. The poor (absolute and low-income) population in the project counties is \ndistributed as follows: Tang County (57,700); Yi County (45,900); Anxin County (24,100); Xiong County (14,400); \nMancheng County (10,200); and Xushui County (11,800). \n \nA  social  and  poverty  assessment  was  carried  out  for  project  interventions  in  compliance  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Guidelines on Incorporation of Social Dimension in Bank Operations.a It included an \nurban affordability assessment, which confirmed that most of the households in the project area could afford the \nproposed  wastewater  (CNY1.3/cubic  meter  [m3])  and  water  supply  (CNY1.5/m3)  tariffs.  The  rural  poverty \nassessment was undertaken using a field survey of 450 rural households and PRA in 10 villages, 4 counties, \ncoupled with key stakeholder discussions. The PRA groups included: (i) three Baiyangdian in-lake villages in \nAnxin; (ii) two villages participating in reforestation subprojects in Yi County; (iii) five villages affected by the \nwastewater subprojects in Li County, Xiong County, and Yi County; and (iv) garbage collectors in Huanghuagou \nRiver area. Institutional consultations were held to discuss subproject designs and the experiences in poverty \nalleviation. The assessment concluded that the rural poverty is linked generally to a number of factors, including: (i) \nlimited off-farm job opportunities; (ii) falling price of reed (for in-lake residents); (iii) deteriorating environment for \nfishing; (iv) diseases and illnesses; (v) lack of lands and rising production costs (irrigation, fertilizer); and (v) lack of \nroads. Some of the in-lake residents also mentioned lack of opportunities in the tourism industry and their inability \nto share the benefits of local tourism. The analysis concluded that poverty was closely linked to deterioration of the \nlocal environment and lack of alternative livelihood opportunities. These underlying causes of rural poverty require \na strategy that promotes improved ecosystem and environmental management.  \n \nThe Project will reduce poverty by (i) strengthening wastewater management to address water pollution; (ii) \nreducing the incidence of waterborne diseases, which are the major causes of rural absolute poverty in the project \narea; (iii) increasing income by providing alternative livelihoods, especially tourism, by improving the environment; \n(iv) providing opportunities for forest and ecosystem recovery; and (v) promoting tourism development. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe project design process was linked to the Baiyangdian Lake Ecosystem Rehabilitation Management Plan using \nlocal experts working in a multi-stakeholder, multi-sector planning process. Consultations with stakeholders, \nbeneficiaries, and Project-affected people have been undertaken in the project design phase and will continue \nduring implementation. A participatory and consultative methodology was adopted to undertake the social analysis \nand  rural  livelihood  survey  during  project  preparation.  It  involved  (i)  a  formal  questionnaire  survey  with \n1,050 households, 100 businesses, and 50 villages; (ii) discussions with project stakeholders; (iii) key informant \ninterviews in rural communities; (iv) a series of stakeholder workshops in each of the subproject counties; \n(v) interviews with key government staff and non-government organizations; (vi) focus discussion with selected \ncommunities; and (vii) focus group discussions with women.  \n \nThe participatory approach is part of the project design and will be used during project implementation, monitoring, \nand  evaluation.  Public  consultations  will  be  held  during  project  implementation  to  seek  feedback  on  tariff \nadjustments and affordability. Existing participatory policies that rely on public hearings to gain approval for tariff \nadjustments provide the mechanism for these consultations. In addition, wastewater and water supply companies \nhave committed to establish a customer complaints desk to receive, process, and document customer complaints. \nInclusive  processes  for  public  participation  in  water  resources  planning,  wastewater  tariff  setting,  tourism \ndevelopment planning, and wetland management plan will be put in place. Public consultations and disclosure of \nresettlement plans (RPs) were conducted during surveys, community meetings, interviews, and workshops. The \nresults of these meetings have been integrated into the RPs, which describe the public consultation plan and \ngrievance process. The consultations, including a grievance mechanism, will continue during land acquisition and \nresettlement so that the problems of affected persons will be properly addressed before project implementation. \n  ", "   58        Appendix 13             \n         \nD.  Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nEcosystem  degradation  and  environmental  pollution  contribute  to  gender  inequities  in  income-generating \nopportunities and workload. Data from the household survey indicate that women are primarily responsible for \ncaring for the sick and cleaning up after the floods. Time and effort spent on these activities means less time for \nincome-generating activities, family, and rest. Improvements in ecosystem management, particularly improved \nwastewater and water supply services, will reduce this burden on women. Increased tourism will create more \nemployment opportunities for women. To maximize the project benefits, women will be given priority in the \nemployment opportunities generated by the Project, and women\u2019s needs and interests will be represented (50% \nrepresentation) through membership on customer committees of the wastewater and water supply companies. \nMeanwhile, women will receive priority consideration for training and other capacity building activities under the \nProject. \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \nThe Project will not have significant negative impacts on women, but the design aspects ensure gender is \naddressed to achieve equal participation of women on project activities and equal opportunities of women to \naccess social services, training, employment and beneficiary agreements, and decision making. Relevant gender \ndesign features are included in the project-specific social action plan (Supplementary Appendix J). \n \n \nE.

A total of 293 hectares (ha) of land   None \nwill be permanently acquired and another 145 ha will be \noccupied  temporarily.  Land  acquisition  will  affect \n4,508 persons in 1,042 households. \n    Affordability of wastewater and water tariffs was analyzed   \n   Significant  on  the  basis  of  citywide  official  income  data.  For  all   Yes \nAffordability    income groups, the combined full-cost wastewater and   \n Not significant  water tariffs for the Project are less than 2% of total    No \n  income,  and  less  than  4%  of  income  for  the  poorest \n None  households.  Tariffs  are  thus  considered  affordable. \nHouseholds living below the poverty line are most likely to \nbe adversely affected by the tariff adjustment. To mitigate \nthe impact of tariff adjustment, the project counties will \nprovide  assistance  to  people  living  below  the  official \npoverty line. In addition, the wastewater and water supply \ncompanies will provide monthly cash rebates on a per \ncapita basis to poor households. This subsidy  will be \nadjusted  as  the  tariff  increases.  The  wastewater  and \nwater  bill  subsidies  largely  offset  the  proposed  tariff \nadjustment  and  are  much  better  poverty  reduction \nmeasures than the lifeline tariff, primarily because they \ncan be properly targeted at poor households \n       \n   Significant  No jobs will be lost.

The Project consists of 22 subprojects. Resettlement plans (RPs) have been prepared \nfor 17 subprojects; the other 5 subprojects do not cause any resettlement impacts. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has classified 14 RPs category B impacts. All persons affected by the \nProject  will  be  eligible  for  compensation  and  assistance.  The  cutoff  date  for  eligibility  for \ncompensation and assistance was the date of the project proposal approval (April 2007). An \nofficial notification of the Project has been announced to all affected persons (APs).  \n \n2.  To avoid or minimize land acquisition and resettlement, there was close consultation \nwith  local  officials,  village  committees,  and  APs  during  project  feasibility  planning  and  RP \npreparation. Permanent land acquisition for the total Project is 293 hectares (ha), of which 71 ha \nis farmland; this will cause partial land loss (20% on average) for 4,508 persons. The subproject \nwith the largest impact (nearly 50% of APs) is the Wangkai-Xidayang Reservoir link-canal \nsubproject, which will affect 2,770 persons. However, the resettlement impacts, even for this \nsubproject, are not serious and the income loss can be restored through cash compensation \nand improved irrigation from the subproject. In total, the Project will require the displacement of \nonly  13  houses  with  49  persons,  who  will  be  compensated  and  relocated  nearby.  Nine \nenterprises will also be affected, but only two small private enterprises need to be totally \nrelocated. Each enterprise will be compensated and workers will not be adversely affected. RPs \nhave also addressed the temporary land occupation of 145 ha, of which 27 ha is farmland, \ntemporarily  affecting  another  1,700  persons.  For  the  construction  of  water  supply  and \nwastewater  pipeline  networks,  mitigation  measures  will  be  taken  to  avoid  or  minimize \ndisturbance on residents and shops; compensation will be provided if disturbance causes direct \nimpacts or extends beyond 2 weeks. \n \n3.  For  people  unavoidably  affected,  the  resettlement  objective  is  to  achieve  equal,  or \nbetter, income and living standards in line with not only the laws and regulations of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), but also ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The PRC laws \nand regulations provide the legal basis for the Project\u2014primarily the Land Administrative Law, \nthe Decision on Reinforcing Reform in Land Administration (State Council, 2004, No. 28), and \nthe  Ministry  of  Land  Resources  Guidelines  on  Improving  Land  Acquisition  and  Relocation \nRegulations (2004, No. 238). Hebei Province and Baoding Municipality have also formulated \nrelated  documents  for  implementing  new  regulations.  All  these  documents  have  provided \nessential policy and procedural basis contained in the RPs. \n \n4.  Based on consultations with local governments and APs, and general practices in the \nsubproject  counties,  the  following  resettlement  principles  were  adopted:  (i) involuntary \nresettlement should be avoided or minimized where feasible; (ii) compensation and entitlements \nprovided for the APs should be able to at least maintain or improve their pre-project standard of \nliving; (iii) all APs will be compensated and assisted, regardless of legal entitlements; (iv) where \nland per capita is not sufficient to maintain livelihood after land acquisition, compensation will be \nprovided either in cash or as land replacement and other income-generating activities; (v) all \nAPs will be adequately informed on eligibility, compensation mode and standards, livelihood and \nincome restoration plans, project timing, and will be involved in RP implementation; (vi) no land \nacquisition will take place unless replacement land or sufficient compensation are given to APs; \n(vii) the Executing Agency (EA) and an independent third party will monitor compensation and \nresettlement operations; (viii) vulnerable groups will receive special assistance or treatment to \nensure that they are better off; (ix) all APs should have the opportunity to benefit from the \nProject;  (x)  RPs  should  be  combined  with  overall  county/city/district  planning;  and \n(xi) implementing  agencies  (IAs)  should  provide  adequate  and  timely  funds,  including  any \nobligations in excess of the RP budget estimates. \n   ", "62  Appendix 15 \n \n5.  The land compensation will be paid to the affected village and/or APs; the resettlement \nsubsidy and other compensation for individual asset loss will be paid to the APs. The affected \nowners will receive compensation at replacement cost for the lost structures and attachments \nwithout  consideration  of  depreciation.  The  affected  household  can  rebuild  their  houses  by \nthemselves with a free house plot provided by the village. APs can salvage the structural \nmaterials and a moving subsidy will also be provided. For affected enterprises, compensation \nwill be paid directly to owners in cash according to the replacement or market value of the land \nand fixed property assets. Income losses from reduced production/sales and wages caused by \nthe Project will be assessed and compensated to APs in cash. \n \n6.  The detailed programs of restoration and relocation have been set out in each RP to \nmitigate  resettlement  impacts  for  APs  and  restore  their  living  standards  according  to  the \neconomic characteristics of affected villages. People can choose the options according to their \nown requirements. Since the resettlement impacts of most subprojects are not serious, the \naffected villages and APs will mainly be directly compensated in cash, but some villages may \nreadjust land. The Project will not have any significant impacts on vulnerable groups and ethnic \nminorities. Vulnerable groups, if any, will be identified and provided preferential treatment to \nensure their rehabilitation. Assistance measures include provision of employment for project \nconstruction, skills training, and employment information (including 30% women).  \n \n7.  The  cost  estimate  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  of  the  17  subprojects  is \n$48.5 million, including contingencies and land taxes. Detailed measurement surveys will be \nconducted in each village and the compensation contracts will be negotiated and signed with \nvillage committees, households, and enterprises. The resettlement costs are included as part of \nthe total project cost and will be funded by each IA.  \n \n8.  APs  have  been  informed  of  the  key  elements  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement \nthrough  consultation  during  the  planning  stage  and  distribution  of  resettlement  information \nbooklets. During meetings, interviews, focus group discussions, public consultation workshops, \nand community consultation meetings, local representatives have participated in the planning; \nand concerns have been integrated into the RPs.  \n \n9.  The  Project  Management  Office  (PMO)  is  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of \nresettlement planning, supervision, monitoring, and reporting. The relevant IA will establish \nproject land acquisition resettlement units for supervising implementation, continuing public \nconsultation,  responding  to  grievances,  and  reporting  progress.  The  grievance  redress \nprocedures are set out in the RPs. Since some of the RPs are based on feasibility studies, the \nRPs will have to be rechecked and, where necessary, updated based on the final design, \ndisclosed to APs, and resubmitted to ADB for approval prior to commencement of civil works. \nThe resettlement implementation schedules for the 17 subprojects were prepared based on the \nfeasibility  study  and  construction  timetable.  The  PMO  has  agreed  to  a  set  of  supervision \nmilestones with ADB to ensure timely and effective implementation of resettlement.  \n \n10.  Internal and external monitoring of resettlement implementation will be required. Internal \nsupervision and monitoring will be done by each IA to ensure compliance with the provisions of \nthe RP. The PMO will engage an independent agency, acceptable to ADB, for monitoring and \nevaluation.  The  detailed  requirements  and  terms  of  reference  for  external  resettlement \nmonitoring are stipulated in the RPs. External monitoring reports will be forwarded directly to \nboth the PMO and ADB, and will be uploaded to the ADB website.  \n  \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080603183114+08'00'", "Author": "C5L", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20080630092049+08'00'", "Title": "Integrated Ecosystem and Water Resources Management in the Baiyangdian Basin Project"}}
