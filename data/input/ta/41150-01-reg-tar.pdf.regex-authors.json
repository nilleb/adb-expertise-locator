INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  As a flagship publication of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Asian Development \nOutlook (ADO) has become an important vehicle for enhancing ADB\u2019s reputation as a credible \nand authoritative source of knowledge about the Asia and Pacific region. The report\u2019s analysis \nof the region provides insights into appropriate policy responses for the economic issues the \nregion faces. Its content informs ADB Management opinion and guides institutional views about \nthe region\u2019s macroeconomic prospects and important development issues. The production of \nthe ADO has been regularly supported by technical assistance (TA) funding. The objectives, \nscope, and activities to be covered by the regional TA are in Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The TA Strategic Forum 2008 recognized the important role that flagship publications \nsuch as the ADO play in monitoring the major economic issues and trends of ADB's developing \nmember countries (DMCs). By regularly providing comprehensive analysis on the evolving \ndevelopments in the DMCs, the ADO provides a basis for understanding the key drivers of, and \nconstraints on, economic growth\u2014a critical element for inclusiveness. In recent issues of the \nADO,  the  publication  featured  timely  topics  on  rebalancing  growth,  macroeconomic \nmanagement beyond the global financial crisis, and the key elements that will sustain Asia\u2019s \nstrong growth in the medium and long term. These are all important topics for developing Asia, \nespecially in the aftermath of the global economic crisis.  \n \n3.  To remain an independent and credible source of knowledge and information about the \nregion, continuous work must be done to further enhance the quality of ADO analysis. Activities \nwill include commissioning relevant applied and policy research on significant and contemporary \nmacroeconomic issues at country and regional levels, developing new sources of information, \nand strengthening peer review. High-quality editing services are crucial to ensure that the \nADO\u2019s key messages are communicated clearly and effectively. To increase the ADO\u2019s regional \nand  international  reach,  the  Economics  and  Research  Department  (ERD)  will  continue  to \npartner with the Department of External Relations (DER) to promote the ADO. \n \n4.  The ADO is one of the most frequently downloaded publications from ADB\u2019s website.2 It \nis directly or indirectly the source of much international and national news commentary that \nfeatures analysis, views, and opinions from ADB. Thus, a concerted effort, not just to come up \nwith a high-quality publication but also to disseminate ADO content and policy messages, is vital \nto  elevate  the  publication\u2019s  profile  and  to  ensure  its  relevance  and  usefulness  in  policy \ndialogues.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The TA will support activities that influence the intellectual environment within which \nauthorities in developing Asia and the Pacific formulate economic policies, and at the same time \npromote ADB as an independent source of knowledge about the region. ADO 2011 and its \n                                                           \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 October 2010. \n2  In the last 5 years, the ADO and ADO Update have consistently ranked among the top ADB downloads from the \nmonth of launch until the following year. At the time of their launches, the ADO and ADO Update have continued to \ngenerate significant coverage from both global and regional top-tier media, such as the Financial Times, the Asian \nWall Street Journal, and the International Herald Tribune. \n ", "2   \nupdate will provide  in-depth, relevant, and timely assessment of the region\u2019s economy. In \naddition, the reports will analyze important medium-term development issues relevant to DMC \npolicy makers. Appendix 2 contains the draft contents pages of ADO 2011 and ADO 2011 \nUpdate. The publication will be presenting original work on current and important issues of \ninterest within developing Asia and the Pacific. \n \n6.  The TA will also further develop and refine analytical methods to support ADB\u2019s short- \nand medium-term country economic monitoring and reporting. The methods will also strengthen \nthe economic underpinnings of country programs and strategies for the DMCs covered, thereby \nenhancing ADB\u2019s country assistance and promoting better-informed economic policies. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  The main outputs of the TA will be the two publications: ADO 2011 and ADO 2011 \nUpdate. The TA will support the following key activities: preparation of background analytical \npapers, further development and refinement of analytical methods, drafting of ADO content, \neconomic  and  copy  editing,  preparation  and  layout  of  materials  for  publication,  and \ndissemination of key results and policy messages. The purpose of the background papers will \nbe to provide a solid empirical and analytical foundation for ADO content. These papers will \nsupplement  the  research  work  of  ADB\u2019s  Macroeconomics  and  Finance  Research  Division \n(ERMF) on the selected topics, analyzing issues and policy implications for the DMCs covered \nusing macroeconomic models, econometric analysis of data, and academic literature reviews. \nSome activities for the preparation of ADO 2012 will also be supported under the TA.  \n  \n8.  To ensure accuracy, coherence, and consistency in approach across the different parts \nof the ADO, high-quality editing services are required. Economic and copy editing activities will \nbe provided by  international consultants working under the direction of the assistant chief \neconomist of ERMF.  \n \n9.  Workshops and conferences will be organized as part of ADO preparation to strengthen \nthe content. The writers\u2019 workshop will focus on macroeconomic analysis of current issues, \ngrowth accounting, economic projections, and effective writing skills, which will target selected \neconomists  in  regional  departments  and  national  officers  in  resident  missions  who  are \nresponsible for writing the country chapters. One of the objectives of the workshop on effective \nwriting is to equip writers with the skills and the tools needed to craft high-quality country \nchapters. This will also impart skills that are of broader relevance for economic and sector work, \nwhich underpins country strategies. The conferences will focus on the reports\u2019 theme chapters. \nDistinguished  economists  from  the  region  will  be  invited  to  discuss  initial  drafts  of  the \nbackground papers to improve the analytical rigor and policy relevance of the theme chapters. \n \n10.  In collaboration with DER, the reports will be widely disseminated. The initial media \nlaunch will be followed by presentations cohosted by ADB development partners within and \noutside the Asia and Pacific region. Outreach will also include more analytical discussions of the \nissues in partnership with academic institutions and think tanks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $690,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 3. \n \n ", "  3 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will be the executing agency responsible for implementing and monitoring the TA. \nGiven the high institutional profile of the ADO, the chief economist of ERD will report to the vice-\npresident for Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development, and the President at \ncritical points in the reports\u2019 preparation. The TA is expected to start in December 2010 and to \nbe completed by March 2012. \n \n13.  The development of analytical tools and approaches to support high-quality ADO content \nwill be a joint effort of ERMF economists, country economists of the regional departments and \nresident missions, national experts, international consultants, and economics editors. As in the \nprevious years, ERMF will seek the cooperation of the regional departments to coordinate with \nthe resident missions on the preparation of the country chapters.   \n \n14.  The TA will finance the procurement of information and knowledge services, such as \nsubscription to macroeconomic data providers (e.g., Bloomberg), as may be required to support \nrelevant and up-to-date content. Equipment, such as computers and software, will be purchased \nby ADB in accordance with its Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) \nand  in  coordination  with  the  Office  of Information  Systems  and  Technology  and  Office of \nAdministrative  Services,  where  applicable.  Equipment  will  be  turned  over  to  ADB  upon \ncompletion of the TA. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with the ADB \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n15.  ADO workshops and conferences are tentatively scheduled for January, February, and \nJuly 2011 at ADB headquarters. The TA will cover the travel expenses of selected resident \nmission staff who will be participating in the workshops as resource persons. Contents of \nselected country chapters and other issues will also be discussed during the January workshop. \nTheme chapter background papers and other issues will be discussed during the February and \nJuly conferences. \n \n16.  The TA will require an estimated 18 person-months of international consultants\u2019 time for \neconomic and technical editing of ADO manuscripts before final publication of ADO 2011 and \nADO 2011 Update. The ADO will also require 8 person-months of international consultancy \nresources for preparing background papers. Another 7 person-months of national economic \nconsultants\u2019 time will be required to assist in preparing country chapters and data sheets. The \noutline terms of reference for the consultants and resource persons are in Appendix 4. The \nconsultants will be hired as individuals.3 Resource persons will also be engaged to act as \ndiscussants during the conferences. Consultants and resource persons will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).  \n \n17.  The major results and key policy messages emerging from the ADO 2011 and ADO \n2011  Update  will  be  disseminated  to  the  media,  DMC  policy  makers,  and  academic \ncommunities. The media launch and subsequent roadshows will be undertaken by ERD in \ncoordination with DER, while separate launches will be undertaken by resident missions in \nselected DMCs. Roundtable discussions and workshops in different academic and economic \n                                                           \n3  The TA will involve independent studies and require rapid mobilization of the editorial consultants to ensure that \nthere  are  no  delays  in  the  tight  production  schedule  of  the  publications.  In  addition,  the  experience  and \nqualifications of the individual consultants will be a primary consideration. Thus, the consultants will be hired on an \nindividual basis. \n ", "4   \ninstitutions  will  also  be  conducted  to  reach  a  wider  audience.  The  TA  will  support  the \ndissemination activities by ERD and DER. Both ADO 2011 and ADO 2011 Update will be \nfeatured on the ADB website, and printed copies will be distributed worldwide. The TA may \nsupport translation of the ADO into other languages, as may be required, to extend its audience \nin selected DMCs. This  will be arranged by regional departments in consultation with the \nresident missions concerned and DER.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $690,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Asian Development Outlook 2011, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and   \nSummary  and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nInfluence the intellectual  Regional and  DER web download  Key messages of ADO are \nenvironment within  international reach of  statistics  communicated effectively. \nwhich policy formulation  ADO     \noccurs and promote    Publicly available citation  ADO reaches target audience \nADB\u2019s reputation as an  Media coverage and  data  in the policy and development \nauthoritative and  readership    community. \nindependent source of    ERMF and regional   \nknowledge about the  Web downloads  department consultations  There is a significant degree \nregion    with clients in country  of interest in DMC outlook. \n  ADO citations in major     \nBetter-informed and  newspapers and  External review  Risk \nbetter-designed policies  publications   \n  Economic or other shocks \nderail baseline assumptions, \nanalysis, and projections, \nundermining the reports\u2019 use \nin policy dialogue. \n \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nImproved content and  Stronger analytical  ADB Management review  Accurate and up-to-date \nquality of ADO 2011 and  content of ADO and  and guidance  information is available for \nADO 2011 Update  better analysis of    DMCs. \nproviding in-depth,  economic prospects  Regional department   \nrelevant, and timely    review and inputs  Risk \nassessments of the  High-quality thematic     \nregional economy of  ADO content  Peer review of content  Staff shortages or skill deficits \nAsia and the Pacific and     \nindividual DMC  Better cohesion and \neconomies, which could  balance among the \nstrengthen the economic  component parts of ADO \nunderpinnings of country   \nprograms and strategies.
