It will \nfinance (i) the border facilities at Wutung, (ii) consulting services \nfor  project  implementation  and  construction  supervision,  (iii) \ncapacity  development,  and  (iv)  a  social  development  program \nincluding HIV/AIDS prevention.  \n   \nRationale  WSP is one of the poorest provinces in PNG in terms of both \neconomic and social development. However, it has potential to \ndevelop  itself  and  drive  the  development  of  PNG\u2019s  northern \ncoastal region if it can capture the opportunities offered by Asia, \nparticularly the neighboring Papua Province of Indonesia, which \nprovides  25%\u201340%  cheaper  products  and  services  and  is  in \ndemand of PNG products.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will help improve the business environment in WSP \nby  reducing  the  business  transaction  costs  associated  with \ninfrastructure, compliance with government rules and regulations, \nand thin human capital. It aims at developing WSP into a dynamic \ngrowth center for PNG, which can catalyze the development of the \nneighboring  provinces\u2014including  Manus,  East  Sepik,  Madang, \nand Morobe provinces.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $30 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $2.33 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of \n$25 million from the Asian Development Fund (ADF) to finance \n83% of the total cost. The Government will provide $5 million, or \n17% of the total project cost. \n ", "ii  \n  The ADF loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing \nRights 15,684,000 ($25 million) will have a maturity of 32 years \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest charge of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, \nequal amortization, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft ADF loan agreement.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2018 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2017 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Border Development Authority (BDA) \n   \nImplementation  BDA will be the Executing Agency for the Project. It will establish \nArrangements  a provincial management office (PMO) in WSP to manage the \nProject on the ground, and eventually develop the PMO into a \none-stop office for promoting investment and trade. \n   \nProcurement  The procurement will mainly consist of civil works and equipment \nand will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). There are two civil works contract packages \nand eight equipment packages. \n   \nConsulting Services  International and national consultants will provide (i) support to \nBDA  and  its  PMO  in  the  areas  of  contract  management, \ninvestment  and  tourism  promotion,  capacity  development,  and \nsocioeconomic  monitoring;  (ii)  construction  supervision  and \nenvironmental  monitoring;  and  (iii)  HIV/AIDS  prevention.  The \nconsultants will be hired according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). They \nwill  be  recruited  through  quality  and  cost-based  selection, \nindividual consultant selection, single-source selection, or other \nmethods as appropriate.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will help PNG benefit from the dynamic economic \nBeneficiaries  development  in  Asia.  Expanded  trade  with  Papua  Province  of \nIndonesia resulting from the Project will (i) encourage PNG to \nspecialize according to its comparative advantages and enable \nefficient  deployment  of  national  resources;  (ii)  increase  PNG \nexports;  (iii) disseminate  to  PNG  ideas,  management  and \norganization skills, and technology to increase productivity of local \nbusinesses;  and  (iv) give  PNG  consumers  a  wider  range  of \nproducts at cheaper prices. \n \nThe Project is economically viable. At a 12% discount rate, the net \npresent value is about K5.52 million and the economic internal \nrate of return is 14.05%. Even at the project preparation stage, \nbusiness  confidence  in  WSP  increased  and  a  record  level  of \nbusiness registration was reported for 2008.  \n ", "  iii\n  The  investment  and  capacity  development  components  of  the \nProject will generate employment for more than 200 persons. The \nspillover benefits to the service sector are difficult to predict, but \nwill be significant. The social development program of the Project \nwill directly alleviate the non-income poverty of five border villages \nwith a population of about 4,000. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project may face the following risks: \n(i)  Procurement. All procurement financed under the loan will \nfollow ADB guidelines, with which BDA is not familiar. Similar \nto other ADB projects in PNG, procurement of civil works will \nbe hampered by lack of qualified contractors. In addition, BDA \nwill have to deal with the Government\u2019s lengthy process for \ncontract approval. \n(ii) Financial  management.  Financial  discipline  is  generally \nweak  in  PNG.  Safeguarding  the  financial  integrity  of  the \nProject will be a challenge for BDA. \n \nThe Project includes the following mitigation measures: \n(i)  providing  procurement  and  financial  consultants  through \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  assist  BDA  in  finalizing  the \nbidding  documents  and  evaluating  bids,  and  providing \ninternational and national consulting services under the loan \nto assist BDA in managing the Project; \n(ii) engaging  a  reputable  accounting  firm  through  the  TA  to \nprovide  long-term  services  to  BDA,  assisting  in  financial \nmanagement;  \n(iii) using modified conditional cash transfer to carry out the social \ndevelopment program to minimize demand on BDA\u2019s capacity \nas well as capture, leakages, and noncompliance; and \n(iv) assisting  BDA  staff  in  joining  ADB  training  programs  on \nprocurement,  financial  management,  anticorruption, \ndisbursement, and project management.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  A  TA  grant  will  be  attached  to  the  Project  to  (i)  assist  the \nDepartment  of  Commerce  and  Industry  in  developing  the \ninvestment legislation and telecommunication strategy for WSP, \nand (ii) assist BDA in procuring civil works for border facilities and \nmanaging the financial aspect of the Project. The objectives of the \nTA  are  (i)  to  assist  in  catalyzing  investment  in  WSP  and \nincreasing the supply of PNG products in demand by helping the \nGovernment  to  prepare  specific  investment  policies  and  a \ntelecommunication solution for WSP, both of which are critical to \nreduce business transaction costs and increase the attractiveness \nof WSP as a destination for investment; and (ii) to facilitate project \nimplementation. \n \n \n \n \n ", "", " \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval of the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nloan to Papua New Guinea (PNG) for the Pilot Border Trade and Investment Development \nProject. The report also describes the proposed technical assistance (TA) for the Trade and \nInvestment Institutional Strengthening and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder  the  authority  delegated  to  me  by  the  Board,  will  approve  the  TA.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Located in the northwest of PNG, West Sepik Province (WSP) is PNG\u2019s third largest \nprovince\u2014with a land area of 3,605 hectares, accounting for 7.77% of PNG's total land. The \nland area of WSP consists of a high mountainous region to the south, Sepik basin in the center, \nand  the  low  coastal  region  to  the  north.  Its  four  districts  are  generally  mountainous,  and \nmountain ranges are dominated by limestone karst with a large number of caves.  \n \n3.  WSP is one of the least developed provinces in PNG. It is remote and isolated from \nPNG\u2019s major population and growth centers, and is only accessible by air and coastal shipping. \nAccessibility within the province is also poor. There is no road connection between Vanimo (the \ncapital of the province) and the four districts, and between the four districts themselves. \n \n4.  There are few economic activities in the province. The modern sector is dominated by \nthe Government and the timber industry. Logs are exported without being processed. Around \n92% of the province\u2019s 190,000 population is isolated in the rural areas, surviving on subsistence \nagriculture. \n \n5.  The internal revenue1 of the province totaled less than K2 million in 2007, the highest \nsince 2004. The province relies almost entirely on national grants to finance basic service \ndelivery such as education, health, and transport infrastructure maintenance. It received about \nK5.64 million in national grants in 2008 and is guaranteed to receive this level of grants annually \nuntil 2013, which will enable it to cover about 50% of the cost of service delivery.2 \n \n6.  The development indicators are among the worst in PNG. The adult literacy rate for the \nprovince is estimated around 45%. Life expectancy at birth is only 46 years, significantly shorter \nthan the national average (57.4 years). The infant mortality rate is 71 per 1,000 live births, the \nfourth highest in PNG. The child mortality rate under the age of five is 64 per 1,000. The \nmalnutrition rate is around 40%.  \n \n7.  The province, nevertheless, has opportunities to improve its development status. First, it \nis richly endowed with minerals, forest, fishery, and eco-conditions for agricultural crops such as \ncocoa, oil palm, and vanilla. Culturally, it is also diverse. The province has five different cultural \nzones and 95 local languages. Each zone has different rites, traditions, and art styles.  \n \n8.  Second, the province shares 260 kilometers of land border with Papua Province of  \nIndonesia, which is the second richest province in Indonesia and offers products and services at \n                                                 \n1 Includes licenses, fees, taxes, commercial receipts, and miscellaneous revenue.  \n2 National Economic and Fiscal Commission. 2008. Review of Provincial Revenues. Port Moresby.  ", "2   \nprices 25%\u201340% lower than those of PNG. Vanimo (capital of WSP) is well connected with \nJayapura (capital of Papua Province of Indonesia) by road. In terms of development status, \nJayapura is about 40 years ahead of Vanimo. \n \n9.  Acknowledging the trade benefits, PNG and Indonesia signed an agreement on Special \nArrangements for Traditional and Customary Border Crossings in 1993. Border residents with \nborder-crossing cards are allowed to freely enter into and travel within the corresponding part of \nthe border area of the other solely for traditional and customary purposes. Each cardholder is \nentitled to $300 worth of goods free from taxes per month. \n \n10.  Indonesia is in demand of beef, beer, betel nuts, cocoa, snack foods, tuna, and vanilla \nfrom PNG, while PNG buys spare parts for trucks, rice, water, electronics, textiles, and house \nware from Papua Province of Indonesia. Official Indonesian records show that the cross-border \ntrade volume reached about $7 million in 2007. At the border, people carry betel nuts from PNG \nto Indonesia and rice from Indonesia to PNG. PNG official records3 show that WSP increased its \ncocoa production from 545 tons in 2004 to 1,193 tons in 2007. Its share of PNG total cocoa \nproduction rose from 1.6% in 2004 to 2.7% in 2007. Statistics from WSP indicate that about \n1,000 tons of vanilla were exported to Indonesia through the Wutung border in 2004 and 664 \ntons of cocoa in 2008.  \n \n11.  Logging and mining can increase revenues temporarily but will not be in the long-term \ninterest of the province. Constructing roads and delivering services across the vast land, with \ndifficult terrains and geotechnical conditions, will be costly and unaffordable. The development \nopportunity for the province lies in strengthening economic cooperation with Papua Province of \nIndonesia and building growth centers. \n \n12.  International experience shows that trade and investment promote economic growth, \ncreate  job  opportunities,  and  develop  human  capital.  Foreign  trade  and  investment  will \ncontribute  more  than  the  needed  finance.  More  importantly,  these  will  bring  with  them \nemployment, technical and engineering skills, management expertise, technology, a business \nculture, and markets. \n \n13.  Expanding cross-border trade with Indonesia will provide people in WSP with a wider \nchoice of products at lower costs and increase their welfare. It will also improve market access \nfor PNG exports, increase business opportunities, stimulate investment, create jobs, enhance \nproductivity, and lead to more rapid and sustainable growth. Promising economic activities that \nmay  be  stimulated  include  cash  crop  production  and  processing,  tourism,  transshipment, \nfishery, and pharmacy. The analysis of WSP and its development opportunities is in Appendix 2.  \n \n14.  Although there seems to be a large number of traditional border-crossing points between \nIndonesia and PNG, the Skouw\u2013Wutung border is the most formal one with significant trade. \nIndonesian border facilities at Skouw were built in 1992 and designed for vehicle crossing, with \na washdown area and large parking facilities for customs and other inspections. The governor of \nPapua Province of Indonesia visited PNG in 2008 and made a joint statement with the Prime \nMinister  of  PNG  to  expand  trade  and  economic  cooperation  between  the  two  sides.  The \nGovernment of Indonesia has approved an increase of tax exemption entitlements for traditional \nborder crossers from $300 to $1,000. In addition to the two existing markets, it has built \n60 market houses, and is planning to build larger and better border facilities. \n \n                                                 \n3 Department of Commerce and Industry. 2008. Statistical Digest. Port Moresby. \n ", "  3\n15.  Since 2006, PNG and Indonesia have been in discussions to open the Skouw\u2013Wutung \nborder  post  and  Jayapura\u2013Vanimo  road  for  vehicles.  Talks  have  also  been  held  on \nimplementation of the agreement on compulsory motor vehicle insurance; direct land, sea, and \nair transportation; avoidance of double taxation; and establishment of the joint business council. \nThe Agreement on Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion is being \nprepared for signing.  \n \n16.  PNG, however, is reluctant to open the border for vehicle crossing because the border \nfacilities at Wutung can hardly cope with the current foot crossing, not to mention traffic flows. \nThere are no parking lots for vehicles from Indonesia and customs and quarantine facilities. The \nsocioeconomic study carried out under the project preparatory TA4 indicates that people are \nconcerned that the border might be opened without a proper infrastructure and management \nsystem to protect PNG from diseases and illegal activities.  \n \n17.  The Project is the first step of the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto enhance economic cooperation between PNG and Asia. It will help improve the business \nenvironment in WSP; and enable WSP to capture the opportunities offered by the fast-growing \nAsian economies for growth, development, and employment.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Challenges \n18.  Developing  WSP  faces  a  combination  of  challenges\u2014external,  internal,  physical, \ninstitutional, environmental, and social.  \n \n19.  Global economic crisis. PNG performed well economically during 2004\u20132007, thanks \nto political and macroeconomic stability and high international commodity prices. Real gross \ndomestic product growth was 2.7% in 2004, 3.4% in 2005, 2.6% in 2006, and an estimated \n6.2% in 2007.  \n \n20.  The global financial crisis that began in late 2008 has caused large falls in the prices of \nPNG\u2019s major export items: 75% for crude oil, 50% for palm oil, 50% for copra, 15% for cocoa, \nand 15% for coffee. PNG\u2019s real gross domestic product growth is projected to slow down to 4% \nin 2009 and 3.5% in 2010. The national grants to the provinces are expected to be reduced by \n25% in 2009 as a result of the dwindling revenue.  \n \n21.  Poor infrastructure. WSP is only connected with the rest of PNG by flight (3 times \nweekly) and coastal shipping (twice a month). Since WSP is not interlinked by roads, air flight is \nthe only means to reach most parts of the vast province. Telecommunication services are costly \nand unreliable. Mobile phones and even landline services are often disrupted, sometimes for \ndays. Internet access is limited to slow and expensive dial-up service. There is no water supply \nin Vanimo, which depends entirely on rainwater. Most of the population has no electricity service \nat  home.  Port  facilities  have  limited  capacity  and  can  only  cater  to  small  vessels.  Border \nfacilities at Wutung post have deteriorated and are not capable of handling vehicle crossing.  \n \n22.  Difficult regulatory framework for investment. The role of the Government of Papua \nNew  Guinea  and  its  policies,  regulations,  and  administrative  practices  are  perceived  as  a \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Preparing the Pilot Border Trade and Investment Development Project. Manila \n(TA 7125-PNG). \n ", "4   \ndisincentive for businesses, as revealed by a recent survey of 243 businesses carried out by an \nADB study in 2007. 5  Nearly 70% of the businesses surveyed indicated that the Government \nwas  unhelpful,  and  50%  cited  costly  and  time-consuming  compliance  with  government \nregulations as a reason to abandon investments.  \n \n23.  The  business  regulatory  framework  does  not  provide  a  conducive  environment.  It \ninvolves significant administrative discretions, cumbersome procedures and processes, and \nunnecessary and unwarranted opportunities for rent seeking. It emphasizes controlling rather \nthan  facilitating  business  development.  The  World  Bank\u2019s  Doing  Business  reports,  which \nquantitatively measure government regulations in terms of starting a business, dealing with \nconstruction  permits,  employing  workers,  registering  property,  accessing  credit,  protecting \ninvestors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts, and closing a business \nindicate that PNG is not improving while other countries are advancing. Most of the indicators \nfor PNG in the 2008 and 2009 reports stayed the same, but its overall ranking slipped from 89 in \n2008 to 95 in 2009. PNG regressed particularly in the areas of starting a business (requiring 8 \nprocedures  and  56 days),  dealing  with  construction  permits  (requiring  24  procedures  and \n217 days), access to credit, and trading across borders.6  \n \n24.  The immigration and labor regulations and minimum wage requirement further reduce \nthe competitiveness of PNG as a business destination. Of 1,048 occupation codes, 578 are \nreserved for nationals. Foreign workers must obtain work permits and an employment visa. \nProcessing of work permits and employment visas is unpredictable, lengthy, and costly. Up-front \ntraining and localization programs are also required from foreign investors. In February 2009, \nthe National Minimum Wages Board proposed a new minimum wage structure for unskilled \nformal sector workers in PNG. If approved, the minimum wage will increase by 274% from \nK37.2 to K101.8 per week within 1 year of effectiveness. The assessment of the regulatory \nframework is in Appendix 3. \n \n25.  As a result of the high cost of doing business, PNG tends to attract large businesses that \nare capital-intensive with potential to yield high returns, such as mining and logging. Agriculture \nand small and medium-sized enterprises, which have employment potential, have not seen \nrising investments. Foreign direct investments fluctuate steeply with mining activities, from about \n$100 million in 2003 to less than $40 million in 2006.7 \n \n26.  In WSP, Vanimo has been declared a free trade zone since 2000, but no investor has \never  applied  to  operate\u2014reflecting  investors\u2019  negative  perception  of  the  WSP  business \nenvironment.  \n \n27.  Thin human capital. The adult literacy rate in PNG is 57.3% and the combined primary, \nsecondary, and tertiary gross enrollment ratio is 40.7%. The adult literacy rate in WSP is around \n45% and there is a skills shortage in almost all professions. The liquefied natural gas project, \nwith its skilled labor requirement anticipated to be 8,000 in the medium term, is expected to \naggravate the labor market. People in WSP fear they may not be able to participate in the \ndevelopment because they do not have entrepreneurship, technical and vocational skills, and \nexperience with trade and formal business enterprise.  \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2007.

Environmental and social challenges. More than 70% of WSP\u2019s land is covered with \noriginal rainforest. Five logging companies have been authorized to operate in the province and \nillegal logging has been suspected. Preservation of the forest will be very difficult given the lack \nof economic activities, vast land, small population, and corruption. Road development may \naggravate the situation. \n \n29.  Although law and security conditions seem to be better in WSP than in other parts of \nPNG, social conflicts and disputes over land titles, concession fees, and compensation are a \nregular occurrence.  \n \n2.  Government Strategy \n30.  As early as 1965, a piece of land was acquired for Wutung border development. The \nGovernment introduced a Border Development Program in 1979 with the main objectives of \nimproving security and stability along the PNG\u2013Indonesia border by promoting the well-being of \nthe people along the border and engaging them in development activities. In 2000, the Physical \nPlanning Office of WSP prepared the Wutung (Physical Planning) Subject Development Plan in \nline with the Physical Planning Act,1989. The Free Trade Zone Act was also enacted in 2000 \nand Vanimo was declared one of the four free trade zones.  \n \n31.  Funding for the Border Development Program and the Wutung border has been limited \nand  on  an  ad  hoc  basis.  PNG\u2019s  total  expenditure  on  projects  along  the  border  is  over \nK21 million to date, in contrast to $30 million annual expenditure by Indonesia in its border \nareas. The Border Development Program was abolished in 2000 and reinstated in 2001. It \nprioritized road construction and establishment of border posts along the border. During 2002 \nand 2003, K350,000 was committed to Wutung border post facilities. In 2004, K4 million was \nprovided for sealing Vanimo\u2013Jayapura road and for Wutung border facilities.8 The road sealing \nwas completed recently and the road is in good condition. However, the Wutung border was \nnever completed according to the Wutung (Physical Planning) Subject Development Plan, 2000. \n \n32.  In  1993,  the  governments  of  PNG  and  Indonesia  entered  into  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding to establish the Joint Border Committee. Meetings of the Joint Border Committee \nare held annually in both countries. To date, 14 memorandums of understanding have been \nsigned on traditional and customary border crossings, demarcation of the boundary, security, \ninternational communication, rescue activities, technical subcommittee, air service, use of the \nFly River, banking, motor vehicle insurance, animal and plant quarantine, and customs.  \n \n33.  The PNG\u2019s Medium Term Development Strategy 2005\u20132010 included private sector \neconomic growth and least developed areas\u2019 interventions as two of the 10 guiding principles.9 \nIt sets the goal of improving living standards through an overarching development strategy of \nexport-driven economic growth, rural development, and poverty reduction. In 2005, K1.7 million \nwas provided to Western Province10 for maintenance of staff housing, schools, health centers, \nairstrips, and existing feeder roads. From 2007 to 2009, K10 million\u2013K20 million was allocated \nannually for border development. In October 2008, the Government established the Border \nDevelopment  Authority  (BDA)  to  address  the  specific  needs  of  the  six  border  provinces \nincluding WSP, particularly infrastructure and foreign and local investment.  \n \n                                                 \n8  Department of Provincial and Local Government Affairs. 2008.

Aside from the Border Development Program, the Government has made efforts to \nincrease  direct  budgetary  support  for  the  poor  provinces.  In  July  2008,  the  Government \namended  the  Organic  Law  on  Provincial  Governments  and  Local-Level  Governments  and \nintroduced a new intergovernmental financing system. The new system provides for provincial \nand local governments as a group to receive funding for recurrent goods and services as a fixed \npercentage of net national revenue. This amount is referred to as the equalization amount. If \nnational revenues rise, provincial and local governments are entitled to share in the increase; if \nrevenues fall, the national grants will also be reduced. The percentage will increase each year \nfrom 2009 to 2013, enabling increasing funding to provincial and local governments for recurrent \ngoods and services. The equalization amount will guarantee all provinces not to receive less \nthan the allocations they received in 2008 during 2009\u20132013. The surplus will then be allocated \non a needs basis.11 This means that a poor province such as WSP will receive relatively more \nresource allocation. \n \n35.  In 1993, PNG became a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, \nwhich identified trade and investment facilitation as one of the three key areas for its future work \nprogram in 1995. PNG joined the World Trade Organization in 1995. It completed a 7-year tariff \nreform program in 2006 and reduced the tariff rates to 15%, 25%, and 40%. It now maintains \none of the least restrictive trade regimes in the region. \n \n36.  PNG has also been an active member of World Customs Organization since 2002. It has \ncompleted the necessary legislative changes to implement practices and procedures based on \nglobal standards approved by the World Customs Organization, and is expected to accede to \nthe Revised Kyoto Convention for the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures \nby 2009.  \n \n37.  Currently,  50%  of  cargo  receives  instant  customs  clearance,  40%  is  subject  to \ndocumentary check, and 10% requires some form of physical intervention by customs. PNG \nCustoms Service is pursuing a customs modernization strategic action plan and striving to \nachieve an 80%\u201310%\u201310% split.  \n  \n3.  ADB Strategy \n38.  PNG\u2019s National Strategic Plan 2010\u20132050, expected to be approved by 2009, aims to \nimprove PNG\u2019s strategic planning, institutions, and systems; develop manufacturing capability; \nand turn PNG into an attractive destination for business and investment. \n \n39.  Regional cooperation and integration is one of the five core operational areas in ADB\u2019s \nlong-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020).12 The Pacific Regional Operations \nBusiness Plan, 2007\u20132010 identified improving trade links between PNG and Indonesia as \nanother avenue for contributing to economic growth and poverty reduction in PNG.13 \n \n40.  A  review  of  the  constraints  and  opportunities  facing  WSP  indicates  that  WSP\u2019s \ndevelopment  prospects  lie  in  strengthening  economic  cooperation  with  Papua  Province  of \nIndonesia. Given the environmental, social, financial, and institutional constraints; the existence \nof the road connection between Jayapura, Vanimo, and Bewani; and the mutual desire of PNG \nand Papua government to expand trade, ADB\u2019s strategy is to assist PNG in improving the WSP \n                                                 \n11  National Economic and Fiscal Commission. 2008.

To make the Project manageable, and since it is \npremature  to  develop  border  management  systems,  the  Project  will  only  provide  the \ninfrastructure for the border and will not address border operations.  \n  \n41.  Although business confidence increased during project preparation (as reflected in the \nbusiness registration in WSP in 2008), ADB recognizes that the Project alone will not be \nsufficient to boost the development of WSP. Border operations, access to capital for business \ndevelopment, agreements on cross-border transport, and other infrastructure needs (such as \npower and water) will also need to be addressed. Capacity development is a long-term task and \nrequires persistent efforts by ADB. The Project is the first initiative in ADB\u2019s series of efforts to \npromote  regionalism  between  PNG  and  Indonesia.  ADB  is  considering  extending  its \nmicrofinance project to WSP, and has planned a regional TA for approval in 2010. The scope of \nthe TA may include (i) preparing a profile of goods and services tradable between PNG and \nIndonesia; (ii) assessing benefits from forward and backward linkages of cross-border trade \nbetween PNG and Indonesia; (iii) developing an investment plan for cross-border transport and \ntrade infrastructure; (iv) strengthening the trade-related institutions and improving the efficiency \nof ports and customs; (v) developing a blueprint for harmonizing transport, trade, tariff policies \nand standards, and regulatory frameworks; and fostering private sector growth to increase trade \nflow; and (vi) developing human resources in trade, transport, and transit facilitation. ADB is \nalso making efforts to catalyze development partners\u2019 assistance to provide water, power, and \neducation facilities in WSP.  \n \n4.  External Assistance  \n42.  The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) is the most significant \ndevelopment partner present in WSP. Its assistance focuses on maintaining national roads and \nstrengthening the capacity of provincial and local level governments in delivering basic services. \nThe  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  has  approved  $1  million  to  assist  the  PNG \nInvestment  Promotion  Authority  through  its  Registration  Reform  Project  to  streamline \ngovernment approval processes and procedures for businesses. The European Commission \nhas  been  supporting  PNG  in  strengthening  capacity  for  trade-related  policy  formulation, \nanalysis,  administration,  and  negotiation;  and  integration  of  trade  aspects  into  PNG\u2019s \ndevelopment and sectoral strategies since 2007. The external assistance is summarized in \nAppendix 4.  \n \n5.  Lessons  \n43.  The  Project  is  the  first  to  promote  development  of  a  poor  area  through  regional \ncooperation in PNG and in the Pacific. Experience from ADB-financed regional projects in the \nGreater Mekong Subregion and Central Asia was reviewed to draw lessons. Major lessons are: \n(i) transport corridors may not necessarily translate into economic corridors if they are not \ncomplemented by the policy and institutional changes that enable better opportunities for the \nprivate sector; and (ii) project design needs to be simplified and avoid addressing too many \nissues. The design of the Project is straightforward; seeks partnership with other agencies and \nADB initiatives; and has taken into account the existence of the northern transport corridor \nlinking Jayapura, Vanimo, and Bewani. The key for economic development along the corridor is \nto remove the border facility bottleneck to permit traffic flow, while addressing constraints to \n ", "8   \nprivate  sector  investment  to  increase  PNG\u2019s  supply  responses  to  Indonesian  and  other \ninternational markets.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n44.  The  Project  will  help  improve  the  business  environment  in  WSP  by  reducing  the \nbusiness transaction costs associated with infrastructure, compliance with government rules \nand regulations, and thin human capital. It aims at developing WSP into a dynamic growth \ncenter for PNG, which can drive the development of the neighboring provinces including Manus, \nEast Sepik, Madang, and Morobe provinces.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n45.  The Project consists of three components: (i) construction and refurbishment of border \nfacilities at Wutung, (ii) capacity development, and (iii) a social development program. It will \nproduce  the  following  outputs:  (i)  border  facilities  including  customs,  immigration,  and \nquarantine facilities; resident housing; roads; parking lots; and public convenience facilities \n(such as food houses, bus shelter, market, and clinic); (ii) a one-stop service office under BDA \nfor promoting trade, investment, and tourism for WSP; (iii) a broadened human capital base with \n500 people trained in commerce and trade; and (iv) improved human development in the five \nborder villages.  \n \n1.  Border Facilities \n \n46.  The existing border facilities, including an administration building and resident houses at \nWutung, are in a state of despair. The administration building has no reliable phone or internet \nconnection and is not equipped to handle any vehicle crossing. It is too small to accommodate \nthe number of staff required to provide services of an acceptable standard. There are no \nadequate storage, quarantine, security, and public convenience facilities. Infrastructure services \n(such as roads, power, and water) are inadequate. Border officials are demoralized because \nthey have been in difficult working and living conditions for years. The Project will construct or \nrefurbish\u2014with  electric,  mechanical,  and  hydraulic  services\u2014customs,  immigration,  and \nquarantine facilities; resident housing; roads; parking lots; and public convenience facilities \n(such as food houses, bus shelter, market, and clinic).  \n \n47.  The border facilities will be designed based on the Wutung (Physical Planning) Subject \nDevelopment Plan, 200014 and in accordance with international border crossing and processing \nstandards and practices. The design will take trade facilitation into account; and enables the \nprocessing of passports, immigration, customs, and quarantine formalities to be carried out \nunder single window procedures for commercial, noncommercial, and pedestrian traffic. \n \n2.  Capacity Development \n \n48.   The institutional capacity assessment (Appendix 5) identifies weaknesses in informal \nand  formal  rules,  organizations,  and  human  capacity  for  PNG,  which  are  dependent  on \nindividuals to improve them. The Government heavily emphasizes basic education, which is \ngenerally available in WSP and across the country. People in WSP are demanding technical, \n                                                 \n14 Sandaun Physical Planning Office. 2000. Wutung (Physical Planning) Subject Development Plan. Vanimo. \n ", "  9\nbusiness, and Indonesian language training so that they can be equal business partners. The \nProject will include a comprehensive program (i) to assist the Government\u2019s policy team to \ndeliver the investment policy legislation, (ii) to develop entrepreneurship and business skills for \npeople in WSP to enable them to participate in the development process and take advantage of \nthe opportunities opened up by the Project, and (iii) to develop human resources in the areas of \ntrade and investment promotion, business administration, financial management, information \ntechnology,  and  Indonesia  language  proficiency  for  PNG.  Possible  initiatives  include \n(i) overseas study tours for the Government\u2019s policy team to acquire exposure to regional \nexperience in trade and investment promotion and cross-border cooperation; (ii) short-term \npolicy  advisory  services  from  prestigious  government  and  business  leaders;  (iii)  in-country \nworkshops; (iv) short-term business skills and financial management training; (v) 3\u20136 month \ninformation technology training; (vi) 6\u201312 month scholarship programs in Indonesia for mid-level \ngovernment officials and local business people; and (vii) degree study in information technology, \nbusiness  administration,  trade,  and  commerce  for  junior  government  officials  and  new \ngraduates. At least 30% of the trainees should be women and 50% should be from WSP. The \ncapacity development programs will be designed, in a consultative manner, by the training \nspecialist and investment policy strategist financed under the Project and a TA grant attached to \nthe Project.  \n \n3.  Social Development Program \n \n49.  To comply with ADB\u2019s social policies; mitigate social conflicts and disputes over land \ntitles, concession fees, and compensation; and extend project benefits to border villages, a \nsocial development program was prepared based on needs prioritized by villagers. The program \n(Supplementary Appendix A) comprises five interventions: (i) power connection for Wutung \nvillage, (ii) construction of septic tanks and individual household toilets for Wutung village, \n(iii) safe motherhood for five West Coast villages, (iv) education support for at-risk children, and \n(v) HIV/AIDS prevention. Implementation of items (i) to (iv) will be carried out using modified \nconditional cash transfer (MCCT), by which outputs will have to be delivered and verified before \ncash is paid from the Project. MCCT is appropriate because education and health services are \navailable to and accessible by the target villages, there is a willingness to pay, and MCCT is an \neffective way to minimize leakages and misuse of funds.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n1.  Regional Cooperation \n \n50.  ADB\u2019s experience in the Greater Mekong Subregion indicates that neighboring countries \nworking together can enhance political trust, expand markets and economies of scale, generate \ngrowth and employment opportunities, and brighten development prospects for all involved. \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 identified regional cooperation as one of the core operational areas for \nADB assistance to free Asia and the Pacific from poverty. \n \n51.  The Project is the first to assist one of the least developed provinces in PNG to benefit \nfrom the dynamic economic development of Asia. It has the potential to build an economic \ncorridor and business growth centers for PNG, which will lead to the development of not just \nWSP,  but  the  neighboring  provinces\u2014including  Manus,  East  Sepik,  Madang,  and  Morobe \nprovinces. Trading with Indonesia has already brought benefits to the border villages. The \nsample survey conducted under the ADB project preparatory TA reports that border villagers \nhave an average monthly income of K1,000 per household, which is higher than Vanimo urban \narea (K800 per household monthly). \n ", "10  \n2.  Partnership and Project Complementarity  \n \n52.  In the process of preparing the Project, close coordination and consultations with major \ndevelopment  partners\u2014including  AusAID,  the  European  Commission,  and  IFC\u2014were \nconducted to join efforts, ensure complementarity, and maximize the comparative advantages of \neach organization. AusAID has the most significant presence in WSP. Since 2007, it has been \nassisting WSP in strengthening its administrative capacity for basic service delivery; maintaining \nthe critical national roads, including the road from Vanimo to the border; and fighting HIV/AIDS. \nIFC is implementing the Regulatory Reform Project\u2014addressing business indicators such as \nwork  permits,  starting  a  business,  licensing  and  registration,  enforcing  contracts,  tax \ncompliance, property registration, and investment policy; and is contemplating a national model \nfor a special economic zone. The European Commission is assisting in capacity development \nfor trade-related policy formulation, analysis, administration, and negotiation.  \n \n53.  The Project will complement AusAID and government efforts in developing WSP. Its \npolicy development will focus on deliberate investment and telecommunication policies for WSP, \ntaking into account other development partners' activities in the same area.  \n \n54.  The Project may also catalyze assistance from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to \nprovide basic infrastructure in WSP such as water supply, power, and Sandaun learning center. \nWSP is preparing the project proposals and intends to seek PRC financing for them through the \nnational Government.  \n  \n3.  Policy Dialogue with the Government \n \n55.  ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with the Government focuses on (i) the development strategy for \nWSP and the design of the border facilities, (ii) the importance of deliberate investment policies \nfor WSP, and (iii) partnership between BDA and West Sepik Provincial Administration (WSPA) \nin  project  management.  The  Government  is  contemplating  a  blueprint  for  WSP  aimed  at \nopening up Lumi and building Bewani into a gateway to Indonesia. ADB considers Vanimo to be \nin the most advantageous position to develop first because of its convenient geographic coastal \nlocation, and proximity and road connection to Jayapura\u2014the location of Papua Province\u2019s \nmajor population and economic activities. The Government\u2019s intention to build up facilities at \nWutung has been always clear. Two pieces of land were acquired for the Wutung border post in \n1965 and in 2003. Discussions with Indonesia on the official opening of the Wutung border have \nbeen ongoing since 2006. Abided by PNG\u2019s construction standards, the design life of the \nfacilities is 50 years. Unless it is believed that WSP will not progress in terms of economic \ndevelopment, the design of the facilities needs to be forward-looking to save costs to the \nGovernment. The restrictiveness of the land available for the Wutung border development as \nwell as the land problems and high costs of goods and services in PNG also favor a design \ntaking into account future development trends.  \n \n56.  While infrastructure is essential for economic growth, the importance of the regulatory \nframework and policies conducive to investment, trade, and private sector development cannot \nbe overemphasized. PNG maintains one of the least restrictive trade regimes in the region, but \nits investment environment is not competitive to add value to its primary goods, increase gains \nfrom global trade, create jobs for its growing population, and move PNG into a nation of wealth.  \n \n57.  Constraints on investment exist at both national and provincial levels. While there is a \nshortage  of  staff,  skills,  and  funding  across  almost  all  government  offices,  government \napprovals, licensing, and procedural requirements with respect to investment are numerous and \n ", "  11\ncomplex. In addition, foreign investors are mandated to bear the costs of knowledge transfer. It \nneeds to be realized that knowledge is not transferred, but acquired. Education is the ultimate \nway to create a skillful labor force.  \n \n58.  Given the development challenges faced by WSP, deliberate policies are required to \nincrease its attractiveness as a destination for private investment. Public resources are always \nlimited, given the competing needs of the country. The private sector has great potential to \nsupplement if an enabling environment is provided. The Department of Commerce and Industry \n(DCI) has agreed to mobilize a policy team to develop investment policy legislation for WSP.  \n \n59.  The success of the Project depends on the quality of the project management, and it is \nin the interest of both BDA and WSPA to ensure project success. BDA was established in \nOctober 2008 and is in need of reliable and capable staff that WSPA can provide. If BDA\u2019s \nprovincial management office (PMO) in WSP is composed of qualified staff from WSPA, it will \nnot only save costs for BDA, but also benefit project implementation as this staff is already \nestablished in WSP and has local knowledge. WSPA agreed to join efforts with BDA and make \nits staff available as needed, particularly the provincial manager, a financial officer, and a female \ncommunity relations officer.  \n \n4.  Public Consultations \n \n60.  During project preparation, extensive consultations at national, provincial, district, and \nvillage levels were conducted to design the project concept, border facilities, social development \nprogram, and implementation arrangements; and assess the socioeconomic and environmental \nimpacts of the Project. The consultations were conducted in the form of (i) regular project \nsteering committee meetings; (ii) meetings and discussions with relevant national government \nagencies; (iii) key informant interviews at provincial, district, and village levels; (iv) focus group \ndiscussions;  (v)  sample  surveys;  and  (vi)  a  workshop.  More  than  12  national  and  local \ngovernment agencies and 600 stakeholders were consulted. The insights obtained through the \nconsultations  have  been  incorporated  into  all  areas  of  the  Project  including  the  project \ncomponents, design of the border facilities, poverty reduction and social strategy, procurement, \nand consulting services. The public consultations are detailed in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n5.  Financial Management \n \n61.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  BDA  was  carried  out  (Supplementary \nAppendix C). BDA was established in October 2008 and has been allocated a K40 million \ndevelopment budget, including K15 million for Wutung border development. Of its proposed \n150 staff positions, 15 are financial positions. An internal audit unit is also proposed. The \ndirector for finance, with accounting qualifications and experience with development partners-\nfinanced (except ADB) projects, has been appointed. The certifying officer, accounts and payroll \nofficer,  and  claim  registration  officer  have  also  been  appointed.  The  position  of  financial \nmanager is still vacant. BDA has installed the Attach\u00e9 accounting system and is only using it for \npayroll purposes.  \n \n62.  In 2008, ADB carried out a country financial management assessment to consider a loan \nto the road sector. The country-level issues identified include (i) weak accounting, recording, \nand reporting; (ii) shortage of skills in financial management and management accounting; \n(iii) delays  in  the  submission  of  audited  annual  project  accounts;  and  (iv)  difficulty  in \nsubstantiating and liquidating the imprest accounts. \n \n ", "12  \n63.  The Project, through the TA grant, will assist BDA in (i) refining its accounting principles, \npolicies, and procedures; (ii) developing budgeting, accounting, and financial management and \ncontrol systems in BDA and its PMO in Vanimo to maintain separate project accounts and \nfinancial statements to identify goods and services financed by various sources including ADB, \nBDA,  and  other  financiers;  (iii)  developing  controls  and  procedures  for  the  flow  of  funds, \nfinancial  information,  accountability,  and  audits  in  relation  to  BDA\u2019s  provincial  offices; \n(iv) developing a financial management reporting system; (v) evaluating the financial aspects of \nthe bids for civil works; (vi) maintaining records, accounts, and supporting documents; and \nliquidating imprest account; and (vii) ensuring the smooth financial operation of the Project.  \n  \n6.  Modified Conditional Cash Transfer \n \n64.  The social development program of the Project (except the HIV/AIDS component) will be \nimplemented using MCCT\u2014the first time under an ADB project in the Pacific. MCCT originates \nfrom conditional cash transfer (CCT), which transfers cash in advance to poor families under \ncertain conditions or promises, e.g., sending children to school. CCT has become increasingly \npopular in the past few years as a development tool in Latin America and elsewhere. However, \nin the Pacific\u2014where fund fungibility is likely to mean fund misuse, and monitoring and self-\ncompliance are problematic\u2014conventional CCT is unlikely to lead to development outcomes.  \n \n65.  The  innovativeness  of  MCCT  is  that  it  uses  PNG\u2019s  clan  system  to  carry  out  the \nintervention  activities  and  transfers  cash  only  to  the  female  head  or  a  female  adult  of  a \nhousehold upon verification of completion of the activities. This modification takes into account \nthe weak institutions and poor record of community-based development projects in the Pacific, \nand the local custom that relatives, friends, and neighbors often pool resources together for \nhousehold projects.  Other  advantages  are  (i)  direct  benefits  to  households;  (ii)  delivery  of \nintervention  outputs  before  fund  disbursement;  (iii)  strong  ownership  by  communities  and \nhouseholds; (iv) minimization of capture, leakage, and noncompliance; and (v) less pressure on \nBDA\u2019s capacity. MCCT has potential for WSP to replicate delivery of its basic social services \nusing the national Government\u2019s functional grants. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan  \n \n66.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $30 million, including taxes and duties of \n$2.33 million, which will be partly financed from the loan proceeds. The costs of different \ncomponents are summarized in Table 1 and detailed in Appendix 6. \n \n ", "  13\n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amount \nA.

Of 150 positions, it has staffed 28 positions and set \nup a core engineering group in the head office. BDA will source staff from WSPA and establish \nand maintain a fully staffed and adequately funded PMO at Vanimo, initially comprising the \nprovincial  manager,  civil  engineers  or  architects,  an  accountant,  and  a  female  community \nrelations  officer;  and  gradually  including  investment  and  tourism  promotion  officers.  The \nprovincial manager will report to the general manager. BDA and its PMO will (i) prepare bidding \ndocuments for civil works and equipment and handle the bidding, (ii) manage the contracts, \n(iii) develop  annual  training  programs,  (iv)  promote  investment  and  tourism  in  WSP, \n(v) implement  the  social  development  program,  (vi)  monitor  the  progress  of  the  Project, \n(vii) prepare applications for fund withdrawals, (viii) prepare the project progress reports and \nproject completion report, (ix) maintain project accounts and financial records for auditing, and \n(x) monitor the socioeconomic impact of the Project. \n    \n70.  BDA  will  engage  Volunteer  Service  Overseas  (VSO)  to  carry  out  the  HIV/AIDS \nsubcomponent to prevent the spread of the disease.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n71.  The Project will be implemented over 8 years. Most activities, such as construction of \nborder facilities and the social development program, should be completed by 2014. Equipment \npurchase and capacity development will continue until 2017. The implementation schedule is in \nAppendix 7.  \n \n3.  Procurement  \n \n72.  BDA\u2019s procurement capacity was assessed (Supplementary Appendix D). Although the \nengineering group consisting of staff with degrees in civil engineering and architecture has been \nestablished, and one senior staff member has experience with supervision of ADB-financed \ncontracts, none of the staff has experience with procurement following ADB\u2019s procurement \nrules. The TA will provide resources to strengthen BDA\u2019s procurement capacity.  \n \n73.  The procurement will mainly consist of civil works and equipment for border facilities. All \nprocurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Constrained  by  the  land \navailability for the contractors, civil works will be divided into two packages and will follow \ninternational  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  single-stage,  one-envelope  procedures,  as  the  cost \nestimates  of  both  contracts  exceed  $3  million\u2014the  ICB  threshold  for  PNG.  Equipment  is \ngrouped into eight packages. ICB will be followed for contracts estimated above $500,000. \nContracts below $100,000 will follow shopping procedures. National competitive bidding will be \nused for contracts between $100,000 and $500,000. The procurement plan is in Appendix 8. \n       \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n74.  International and national consulting services will be required for (i) support to BDA and \nthe PMO in the areas of contract management, investment and tourism promotion, capacity \ndevelopment,  and  socioeconomic  monitoring;  (ii)  construction  supervision  and  environment \n ", "  15\nmonitoring; and (iii) HIV/AIDS prevention. The Project will fund a total of 350 person-months of \nconsulting services (128 international, 222 national).  \n \n75.  All consulting services will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Individual consultants and international or \nnational  business  volunteers  will  be  engaged  to  provide  services  required  under  area  (i) \nbecause of the diverse expertise required and the effectiveness of business volunteers in \nproviding services. An international consulting firm will be recruited based on the quality and \ncost-based selection method with a quality and cost weighting of 80:20 to provide construction \nsupervision. HIV/AIDS prevention will engage VSO\u2019s services through single-source selection. \nSingle-source  selection  is  justified  because  VSO  is  the  only  reputable  nongovernment \norganization  active  in  WSP  fighting  HIV/AIDS.  BDA  has  requested  ADB  to  perform  the \nconsultant  selection  financed  under  the  ADB  loan  to  expedite  the  Project.  The  plan  for \nconsulting services is in Appendix 8. The outline terms of reference for implementation support \nand  construction  supervision  are  in  Supplementary  Appendixes  E  and  F.  The  HIV/AIDS \nprogram is described in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n5.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing \n \n76.  The border facilities are a matter of urgency for the Government, as the official opening \nof the border has been under consideration for several years. The Government requested ADB \napproval of advance action for recruitment of consulting services for investment and tourism \npromotion and capacity development, and procurement of two civil works packages for border \nfacilities and a patrol boat. Advance action covers invitations for bids, bidding, bid evaluation, \nand limited contract awards. The advance action will be supported by the TA and undertaken in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the advance action, if granted, does not commit \nADB to finance the Project. \n \n77.  To facilitate project implementation, the Project will provide retroactive financing to meet \nthe costs of the consulting services and civil works. The retroactive financing will be applicable \nfor expenditures incurred no earlier than 12 months prior to the date of the Loan Agreement. \nThe Government has been informed that the amount of retroactive financing must not exceed \n20% of the ADB loan amount and that approval of retroactive financing does not commit ADB to \nfinance the Project.  \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n78.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government and BDA. The Government and BDA shall adhere to ADB anticorruption \nrequirements  during  project  implementation.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts \nfinanced by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of \nADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of BDA and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. If ADB determines that \nrepresentatives of the Borrower, a beneficiary, a contractor, and/or a consultant are engaged in \ncorrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices,  ADB  may  take  the  following  actions: \n ", "16  \n(i) reject any proposal for contract award, and/or (ii) declare any firm or individual ineligible for \nADB-financed contracts, indefinitely or for a stated period of time. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n79.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The disbursement procedures \nwill  include  direct  payments,  imprest  account,  and  reimbursements.  BDA  will  establish  an \nimprest account with either the central bank or a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. It will use \nthe  imprest  account  exclusively  to  finance  eligible  expenditures  as  specified  in  the  Loan \nAgreement. The initial amount to be deposited into the imprest account will not exceed either \n6 months of estimated expenditures to be financed from the imprest account or $500,000, \nwhichever is less. For civil works and consulting services, direct payment or reimbursement will \nbe used.  \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n80.  BDA and its PMO will maintain separate accounts for the Project and prepare separate \nfinancial statements indicating the sources and uses of funds, and have them audited by an \nindependent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  audited  project  accounts,  BDA\u2019s  corporate \naccounts, and the respective auditors\u2019 reports\u2014which should include separate audit opinions on \nthe use of the imprest account for the loan, compliance with the financial covenants of the Loan \nAgreement, and BDA\u2019s internal financial control\u2014will be submitted to ADB within 6 months after \nthe end of each fiscal year. BDA will also prepare and submit to ADB monthly and quarterly \nproject progress reports and a project completion report within 3 months of completion of the \nProject. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n81.  BDA will monitor the project performance and assess the socioeconomic impact of the \nProject  in  accordance with  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  of  the  Project.  It  will  be \nassisted by 8 person-months of international consulting services. Since the baseline data have \nbeen provided under the project preparatory TA, the international consultant will commence \nwork 1 year after the Project starts, and carry out the monitoring and evaluation exercise \nannually for 8 years. \n \nIV.   TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n82.  A TA grant will be attached to the Project to (i) assist DCI in developing the investment \npolicy legislation and telecommunication strategy for WSP, and (ii) assist BDA in procuring civil \nworks for border facilities and managing the financial aspect of the Project. The objectives of the \nTA are (i) to assist in catalyzing investment in WSP and increasing the supply of PNG products \nin  demand  by  helping  the  Government  to  prepare  specific  investment  policies  and  a \ntelecommunication solution for WSP, both of which are critical to reduce business transaction \ncosts  and  increase  the  attractiveness  of  WSP  as  a  destination  for  investment;  and  (ii)  to \nfacilitate project implementation. The terms of reference are in Appendix 9. \n \n83.  Cost  and  financing.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.06  million  equivalent.  The \nGovernment has requested ADB to provide $900,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special Fund  (TASF-IV).  The  Government  will \nprovide $160,000 equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office accommodation and support \n ", "  17\nservices,  local  communication  and  transport,  and  other  services  and  facilities  required  for \nimplementation of the TA. \n \n84.  Implementation arrangements. DCI will be the Executing Agency for investment policy \nlegislation and telecommunication strategy development, and BDA will be the Executing Agency \nfor BDA capacity development. DCI will mobilize an interdepartmental policy team to study and \ndevelop the investment policy legislation and telecommunication solution for WSP, comprising \nsenior representatives from the departments of national planning and monitoring, treasury, \nforeign  affairs  and  immigration,  communication  and  information,  provincial  and  local  level \ngovernment affairs, and labor and industrial relations; National Lands Commission; Internal \nRevenue Commission; PNG Customs Service; Investment Promotion Authority; BDA; WSPA; \nand other relevant government offices.  \n \n85.  The TA will require a total of 38 person-months of international consulting services to \ncarry out the scope of the study as defined in the outline terms of reference in Appendix 9. The \nareas  of  expertise  required  include  investment  policy  formulation,  telecommunication, \nprocurement, and financial management. The TA will be implemented from 2010 to 2014.  \n \n86.  The TA will be carried out by both individual consultants as well as consultants from an \ninternational firm. Individual consultants will be engaged for the development of investment \npolicy  legislation  and  telecommunication  strategy  and  procurement,  while  an  international \naccounting firm will be selected to provide individual consultants to assist BDA in financial \nmanagement. This is because required expertise is diverse, and it will be difficult for a firm to \nprovide quality consultants for all areas. However, a reputable accounting firm will be more \nreliable and less risky than individual financial consultants to provide financial management \nservices. The consultant recruitment will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. \n \nV.   PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits \n \n87.  The economic analysis (Appendix 10) of the Project compares the \u201cwith-project\u201d and \n\u201cwithout-project\u201d scenarios. The assessment covers the period from 2010 to 2034 and assumes \nthe implementation schedule in Appendix 7 is followed. All benefits and costs are in constant \n2009 prices. Economic benefits such as business efficiency, job creation, skill development, and \nreduction in income differential between towns far from the border and towns neighboring the \nborder, which are difficult to quantify, are excluded from the analysis.  \n \n88.  The economic costs of the Project consist of (i) capital costs, including labor, material, \nequipment, consulting services, and physical contingency; and (ii) maintenance costs. The \neconomic cost of land is not included because there is no incremental cost between with- and \nwithout-project scenarios, as the land has been allocated for border development. The major \neconomic benefit arises from the reduction in trade transaction costs, resulting in increased \ngovernment revenue, producer surplus, and consumer surplus from increases in imports and \nexports. Other economic benefits include saving in household income on waterborne diseases, \nand income gains from extended life expectancy and education. \n \n89.  Discounted at a rate of 12%, the Project is economically viable. The net present value \n(NPV) of the Project is K5.52 million and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is 14.05%. \nThe calculation was subject to sensitivity analysis, which tests the effects of negative changes in \n ", "18  \nthe key parameters that determine the benefits and costs of the Project. The sensitivity analysis \nshows that the Project remains economically viable in spite of a 10% increase in costs or \n10% reduction in benefits. In the worst case scenario, where the Project suffers from both a \n10% reduction in economic benefits and a 10% increase in economic costs, the Project provides \nan EIRR of 10.95%. \n \nB.  Project Sustainability \n \n90.  PNG currently enjoys a comfortable debt position. By 2008, PNG\u2019s public debt stood at \n31.6% of gross domestic product, and its external debt at 13%\u2014low in comparison with the \nInternational Monetary Fund\u2019s 30% threshold. The Project will have minimum impact on PNG\u2019s \ndebt position, given its long term of repayment.  \n \n91.  The  annual  average  recurrent  cost  of  the  border  facilities  is  around  K350,000, \naccounting for about 0.9% of BDA\u2019s current development budget allocation of K40 million. \nBDA\u2019s operations are fully funded by the Government. The Project will be sustainable if the \nGovernment remains committed to the development of its border provinces and continues to \nmake efforts to unleash the potential of the private sector by improving its policy environment \nand administrative efficiency. Infrastructure alone will not be sufficient to generate economic \nactivities. Political will and policies are more powerful to achieve development breakthroughs, \nincluding infrastructure.  \n \nC.  Project Impact \n \n1.  Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous People \n \n92.  The Project has been classified category C for involuntary resettlement. The two pieces \nof land for the border facilities were acquired in 1965 and 2003, and have been cleared before. \nThe Project will not cause loss of housing, strips of land, crops, trees, or other fixed assets.  \n \n93.  For indigenous people, the Project is categorized category B and is required to develop \na specific action for Wutung villagers who are the traditional landowners of the two pieces of \nland acquired for the border facilities. A series of consultations, interviews, and focus group \ndiscussions and a socioeconomic survey for 85% of households in Wutung village were carried \nout to identify people\u2019s concerns and development priorities, and design the border facilities and \nan intervention program. \n \n94.  The border facilities will include public phones, market areas, and a clinic. A social \nprogram (Supplementary Appendix A) was developed to provide access to power, build their \nown toilets, support pregnant women to undergo regular medical check-ups, and keep \u201cat-risk\u201d \nchildren in schools. The total cost was estimated to be around $270,000 and is budgeted under \nthe Project.  \n \n2.  Poverty Reduction Impact \n \n95.  In terms of both income and non-income poverty, WSP is one of the worst provinces in \nPNG. Yet WSP has an opportunity to develop if it can manage to strengthen its economic \nlinkage with Asia and maximize the benefits. The benefits of trade with Indonesia have already \nbeen manifested in border villages where villagers are earning higher incomes than in the rest \nof the province. In addition to income, exposure to Indonesians\u2019 way of doing business and \n ", "  19\nliving standards has generated a desire to learn and catch up, and a demand for healthy \nlifestyles.  \n \n96.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  WSP  by  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment for investment to stimulate economic activities in the province. With investment, \nparticularly in agriculture and tourism, more people will be absorbed into modern sector and \nhave better access to social services. The investment and capacity development components of \nthe Project will generate employment of more than 200 people. The spillover benefits to the \nservice sector are difficult to predict, but will be significant. \n \n97.  The social development program of the Project will directly alleviate the non-income \npoverty of five border villages. The availability of power and sanitation facilities, improved infant \nand  maternal  health,  and  education  for  children  will  not  only  improve  their  current  living \nstandards, but also pave the way for future generations to be free from poverty. The social \ndevelopment  program  has  the  potential  to  be  an  alternative  for  WSP  to  improve  the \neffectiveness of its service delivery using the national grants.  \n   \n3.  Social and Gender Impact \n \n98.  During project preparation, the potential social and gender impact of the Project was \nanalyzed through field consultations, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and \nsample surveys. These consultations were complemented by consultations with government \nagencies, nongovernment organizations, and faith-based groups\u2013including the National AIDS \nCouncil, Department of Health,  Sandaun Provincial AIDS Council, provincial health, education, \ncommerce  and  trade,  forestry,  and  agricultural  divisions;  Vanimo  Green  District;  Wards; \nSandaun  Provincial  Council  of  Women;  and  the  Catholic  Diocese  of  Vanimo.  More  than \n100 women  were  consulted.  The  consultations  reveal  that  people  appreciate  the  income \nopportunities provided by the border. They are concerned about the social service delivery and \nopening of the border without proper infrastructure and systems in place to protect PNG people \nfrom diseases, HIV/AIDS, and illegal activities. The design principle for the border facilities, \npurchase of equipment, and the social development program have factored in their concerns. \nFor instance, the border facilities will include closed circuit television for security monitoring and \na clinic, which will be operationalized by VSO for HIV/AIDS prevention and other medical \nservices to the villagers. A marine patrol boat has been included under the Project to strengthen \nPNG Customs Service\u2019 law-enforcing capabilities in the northern coast.  \n \n99.  Women  and  vulnerable  groups  are  not  disproportionately  affected  by  the  Project. \nWomen may be more vulnerable to HIV/AIDS than men because of their low social status and \nviolence  against  women.  To  promote  gender  and  social  equity,  the  Project  includes \ninterventions for women and vulnerable groups as follows: \n(i)  providing training programs to women to develop their entrepreneurship and \nbusiness skills; \n(ii)  providing financial assistance to pregnant women for regular medical check-ups \nand reducing infant and maternal deaths; \n(iii)  transferring cash to the female head or a female adult of a household upon \ncompletion of the relevant intervention activities; \n(iv)  involving local women\u2019s groups in the verification process for MCCT; and  \n(v)  targeting young women for HIV/AIDS education.  \n \n100.  The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11. \n ", "20  \n4.  Environmental Impact \n \n101.  The Project has been categorized environment category B in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). The construction \nof border facilities will take place on land previously cleared. Sanitation facilities in Wutung \nvillage will be constructed within the village compound. An initial environmental examination \nreport, environmental management plan, and environmental management and monitoring plan \nhave  been  prepared.  A  summary  initial  environmental  examination  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix H. \n \n102.  Consultations were held with all relevant public sector, private sector, and community \norganizations in the project area. There was universal support for the Project and open debate \non its environmental risks and benefits. Consultations informed changes to the project scope, \nimplementation arrangements, and the environmental management and monitoring plan. \n \n103.  The project area does not include any protected areas or areas of conservation value. \nThe Project will not create any impact on cultural or heritage sites. Major environmental risks \ninclude the removal of asbestos during site preparation and the appropriate design of septic \ntanks in Wutung village where the groundwater is as low as 1 meter below the surface.  \n \n104.  As summarized in the environmental management and monitoring plan, which will form \npart of the construction contract, the mitigation measures to address the environmental impacts \nare  appropriate  and  comprehensive.  Environmental  management  and  monitoring  will  be \nundertaken by BDA with support from the construction supervisors. No further environmental \nstudy is required. \n \nD.  Project Risks and Mitigation Measures \n \n105.  The Project may face the following risks: \n(i)  Procurement.  All  procurement  financed  under  the  loan  will  follow  ADB \nguidelines, with which BDA is not familiar. Similar to other ADB projects in PNG, \nprocurement of civil works will be hampered by lack of qualified contractors. In \naddition,  BDA  will  have  to  deal  with  the  Government\u2019s  lengthy  process  for \ncontract approval. \n(ii)  Financial  management.  Financial  discipline  is  generally  weak  in  PNG. \nSafeguarding financial integrity will be a challenge for BDA.  \n \n106.  The Project includes the following mitigation measures: \n(i)  providing procurement and financial consultants through the TA to assist BDA in \nfinalizing the bidding documents and evaluating bids, and providing international \nand national consulting services under the loan to assist BDA in managing the \nProject;  \n(ii)  engaging  a  reputable  accounting  firm  through  the  TA  to  provide  long-term \nservices to BDA, assisting in financial management;  \n(iii)  using MCCT to carry out the social development program to minimize demand on \nBDA\u2019s capacity as well as capture, leakages, and noncompliance; and \n(iv)  assisting BDA staff in joining ADB training programs on procurement, financial \nmanagement, anticorruption, disbursement, and project management.  \n \n ", "  21\nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \n107.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  BDA  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  Governance and anticorruption.

The Government will cause BDA to appoint \nthe procurement and financial specialists to be engaged under the TA to the \ntechnical evaluation committee to assist in the evaluation of the bids.  \n(viii)  Construction  quality.  The  Government  will  cause  BDA  to  ensure  that  the \nProject is built in accordance with the technical design specifications and that \nconstruction  supervision,  quality  control,  and  contract  management  are \nimplemented in accordance with internationally accepted standards. \n(ix)  Operation and maintenance. The Government will make available adequate \nbudget allocation on an annual basis to BDA for the operation and maintenance \nof the project facilities, and ensure that such budget will be used for its intended \npurposes.  \n(x)  Environment. The Government through BDA will ensure that (a) the Project is \ncarried  out,  and  all  project  facilities  are  designed,  constructed,  operated, \n ", "22  \nmaintained, and monitored in compliance with all applicable PNG environmental \nlaws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy;  (b)  in  case  of  any \ndiscrepancies between PNG\u2019s environmental laws, regulations, and procedures \nand  ADB\u2019s  requirements,  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  will  prevail;  (c)  all \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures,  institutional  requirements,  and  monitoring \nplans specified in the initial environmental examination are complied with; (d) all \nthe above requirements are incorporated in the bidding documents and civil \nworks  contracts  to  ensure  compliance;  and  (e)  environmental  compliance \nmonitoring is undertaken in accordance with the initial environmental examination \nas updated.  \n(xi)  Resettlement. The Government will ensure that no involuntary resettlement will \nbe  involved  in  the  Project.  In  the  event  that  any  resettlement  impacts  are \nunavoidable for any project activities, the Government will prepare resettlement \nplans  for  such  activities  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement \nPolicy (1995). \n(xii)  Guidelines for modified conditional cash transfer. Within 6 months of loan \neffectiveness, the Government, through BDA, will develop, and submit to ADB for \napproval, guidelines for implementing the MCCT scheme. The guidelines will \ninclude, among other things, (a) eligibility criteria for the recipients, (b) eligible \nexpenditures that may be financed, (c) approval procedures for eligible activities, \n(d)  administration  mechanism  including  accounting  and  funds  flow,  and \n(e) monitoring and reporting mechanism. The Government, through BDA, will \nensure  that  any  activities  related  to  the  MCCT  scheme  are  implemented  in \naccordance with the guidelines. \n(xiii)  Monitoring and evaluation. The Government will cause BDA to monitor and \nevaluate the project performance and socioeconomic impacts in accordance with \nthe design and monitoring framework as updated.  \n(xiv)  Labor, health, and gender development.

West Sepik Province (WSP) is located on the northwest end of Papua New Guinea \n(PNG) with a land area of 3,605 hectares, the third largest land size in PNG. It has three broadly \ndefined zones: the high mountainous region to the south, Sepik basin in the center, and the low \ncoastal region to the north. Its four districts (Aitape-Lumi, Nuku, Vanimo-Green River, and \nTelefomin) are generally mountainous, while the coastal areas of Vanimo-Green River and a \nlarger part of Aitape-Lumi are relatively flat with undulating hills and swampland. Limestone \nkarst dominates highland areas, with a large number of caves. \n \n2.  The 2000 National Census showed that the province had a total population of 185,741, \nof which 95,523 were males and 90,218 females, indicating a ratio of 106 males to 100 females. \nThe population density was 5 persons per square kilometer, with an average household size of \n5.5 persons. The average population growth rate in the province has been 2.4% since 1980. \nYouth under the age of 15 constituted about 44% of the total population.  \n \nB.  Political and Administrative Structure \n \n3.  There are two levels of government in the province\u2014provincial government and local \nlevel government. The structure of the provincial government is in Figure A2.1. \n \n \nFigure A2.1: Provincial Government Organization Structure \n \n \n  Provincial Government \n \n \n  Provincial Assembly \n \n \n \nProvincial Executive Council \n \n \n \n  Provincial Administration \n \n \n \nProvincial Headquarters \n \n \n \n \n    Aitape-Lumi  Nuku  Telefomin  Vanimo-Green \nRiver \n \n \nSource: West Sepik Province Corporate Plan 2006\u20132010.   \n \n ", "    Appendix 2  27   \n4.  The four districts are further divided into 17 local level governments, each of which has a \nsimilar structure. The provincial executive council and provincial assembly  make decisions \nrelating to policy, budget, and project development.  \n \nC.  Provincial Administration \n \n5.  The  provincial  administration  is  responsible  for  service  delivery  in  the  province.  It \nconsists  of  two  levels  of  administration.  The  first  level  is  the  provincial  headquarters \nadministration, and the second level comprises the four district administrations. The current staff \nceiling  for  the  provincial  administration  is  435.  Of  these,  106  positions  are  based  at  the \nprovincial headquarters while 329 positions are distributed between the four districts and local \nlevel  governments  throughout  the  province.  There  are  over  800  teachers  working  in  the \nprovince. The structure of the provincial headquarters administration is in Figure A2.2. \n \nD.  Provincial Revenue \n \n6.  The provincial revenue1 consists of national grants, distribution from goods and services \ntax, and provincial revenue generated in the province. In 2008, national grants were increased \nby about 25% from K4.51 million in 2007 to K5.64 million.

Business Sector \n \n7.  Subsistence farming is the most common economic activity throughout the province. \nLogging companies are the largest employers in the province. There are 66 sole proprietorship \nbusinesses, 25 cooperatives, 19 corporations, 40 storekeepers (17 female and 23 male), and \n160 peddlers (72 female and 88 male) registered in Vanimo. Nine corporations and 15 sole \nproprietorships were registered in 2008\u20132009. Not all businesses are registered in the provincial \nbusiness registry since their main companies are registered elsewhere in PNG. Most registered \nbusinesses are in agroforestry activities, construction, maintenance, wholesale, and retail.  \n \nF.  Development Challenges and Opportunities \n \n8.  Infrastructure. The province is linked with the rest of PNG by air flights and coastal \nshipping, but not by roads. Internally, the four districts are not interconnected by roads, and \ntravel  is  only  possible  by  air.  Airfares  are  prohibitively  expensive\u2014a  round-trip  from \nPort Moresby (national capital) to Vanimo (provincial capital) costs about K1,600. There is only \none ship carrying goods such as rice, building materials, and vehicles from Lae or Madang to \nVanimo twice a month. Two passenger ships operate weekly between Madang, Wewak, Aitape, \nand Vaimo. The ships sometimes break down, leading to the stores running out of essential \nhousehold goods, particularly salt and meat.  \n \n9.  Power supply is only available to urban communities. Power interruptions are frequent. \nMost establishments and offices have a backup power generator in place. Telecommunication \nservices are unreliable and costly. Internet service provided on fixed lines is very slow and \nexpensive. The average fastest download speed is 16 kilobytes per second. Water supply, \nsanitation,  and  sewerage  systems  are  generally  not  available.  Most  households  rely  on \nrainwater tanks or water trucks for water supply, buckets, and pit toilets.  \n \n10.  Land  problems.  As  elsewhere  in  PNG,  the  majority  of  land  in  the  province  is \ncustomarily owned. There is no official measurement of alienated state and customary lands \nwithin Vanimo. Ownership of land is controversial, and disputes over land titles, concession \nfees, and compensation issues are regular occurrences.  \n \n11.  Access to capital. Prospective businesses in the province have almost no access to \ncapital. Banks do not provide loans unless the loans are 100% guaranteed by cash deposits or \n100%  secured  by  collateral.  Since  land  titles  are  subject  to  disputes,  the  use  of  land  as \ncollateral has been limited\u2014even for landowners.  \n \n12.  Human development. According to the 2000 census, school attendance was very low \nin the province. Only 24% of males and 20% of females aged 5\u201329 were in school; 62% of \nmales and 47% of females aged 10 years above had ever been to school. Only 14% males and \n11% females had completed grade 10.  \n \n13.  The infant mortality rate is 71 per 1,000 live births, the fourth highest in PNG. The child \nmortality rate before the age of 5 is 64 children per 1,000. Life expectancy is 45.6 for men and \n46.5 for women. The maternal mortality rate is difficult to determine as more than 80% of \npregnant women deliver in the villages. It was estimated that 200 mothers per 10,000 die \nannually. There are 119 confirmed cases of HIV/AIDS, of which 45 (38%) are men, 62 (52%) \nare women, and 12 (10%) unknown.  \n \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \n \n14.  Opportunities. The province is richly endowed with natural resources such as copper, \ngold,  rainforest,  and  tuna.  It  has  fertile  land  to  grow  cocoa,  vanilla,  oil  palm,  betel  nuts, \nvegetable, and flowers. Culturally, it is diverse with five different cultural zones and 95 local \nlanguages\u2014each with different rites, traditions, art styles, rules for land ownership, settlement \npatterns, male\u2013female relationships, and food.  \n \n15.  The  Government  established  the  Border  Development  Authority  (BDA)  in  2008  to \naddress the infrastructure needs of six border provinces including WSP. It is contemplating an \nambitious  economic  corridor  development  plan  for  the  province,  including  road  linkages, \nairports, and development zones.  \n \n16.  The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) is assisting the province \nin improving basic service delivery such as education, health, and infrastructure maintenance \nthrough provincial performance improvement initiatives (divided into three phases). Phase 1 \nfocuses on capacity development for corporate management; phase 2, service delivery; and \nphase 3, a combination of both. The province has received K250,000 for completion of phase 1 \nand will receive up to K1 million during phase 2. AusAID is also sealing and maintaining the \nmajor roads in the province, including the one connecting Vanimo with Jayapura, the capital of \nPapua Province of Indonesia.  \n \n17.  The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) still has about $100 million development aid that \nhas not been allocated to projects. The aid will be highly concessional loans with an interest rate \nof 2% and repayment period of about 20 years. If the PRC\u2019s aid is mobilized to provide power, \nwater supply, and a learning center, the business environment in WSP will be significantly \nimproved.  \n \n18.  The  Government  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  are  considering  extending  a \nmicrofinance project to the province.  \n \n19.  The province shares 260 kilometers of land border with Papua Province of Indonesia, \nwhich offers services and products 25%\u201340% cheaper. The trade volume between WSP and \nPapua Province of Indonesia reached $7 million in 2007.  \n \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 3  31   \nASSESSMENT OF REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR TRADE AND INVESTMENT \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The regulatory framework that governs trade and investment in Papua New Guinea \n(PNG)  is  complex.  Key  legislation  that  comprises  this  regulatory  framework  includes  the \n(i) Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local-Level Governments, 1998; (ii) Investment \nPromotion Act, 1992; (iii) Customs Act, 2006 (being amended); (iv) Free Trade Zone Act, 2000; \nand (v) labor law (Employment of Non-Citizens Act, 2007). These laws and regulations have \nsound intent and objectives, but in reality, either they are not implemented, or they hinder trade \nand investment as they incur high compliance costs. \n \nB.  Organic Law on Provincial Governments and Local-Level Governments  \n \n2.  While  the  Organic  Law  on  Provincial  Governments  and  Local  Level  Governments \n(Organic Law) does not directly regulate trade and investment, it is a key element of the \nregulatory  framework  as  it  is  the  legislation  that  establishes  provincial  and  local-level \ngovernments and their roles. A key purpose of the Organic Law is to provide the basic human \nneeds for water, health, education, transportation, communication, accommodation, and social \norder through economic self-reliance; and to create subordinate institutions of government for \nthe provinces and local government areas. \n3.  The  PNG\u2019s  Medium  Term  Development  Strategy  2005\u20132010  identified  that  the  key \nobjective  of  the  Organic  Law  was  to  improve  service  delivery  by  transferring  significant \nresponsibilities and funds to provincial and local level governments. However, the Medium Term \nDevelopment Strategy acknowledges that services have deteriorated since the Organic Law \nwas passed. Service delivery systems are dysfunctional and there is widespread confusion over \nfunctional  and  financial  responsibilities  across  the  three  levels  of  government.  Institutional \ncapacity to deliver services is generally poor.1  \n4.  There is little evidence in West Sepik Province (WSP) that these problems have been \naddressed and impediments to service delivery overcome. This failure is disappointing as the \nlegislation provides for a range of benefits to be delivered to provincial and local governments. \n5.  Section 91 of the Organic Law states that the national Government shall make the \nfollowing  grants  to  the  provincial  and  local  governments:  (i)  administrative  support  grants, \n(ii) development grants, (iii) town and urban services grants, and (iv) economic grants. The \ndevelopment grant provides specifically for a provincial infrastructure grant, of which 50% will go \nto  social  services  and  administrative  infrastructure,  and  50%  to  land  and  other  physical \ninfrastructure development. When considered in the context of development of a free trade zone \narea, with improved forward budget planning and more efficient use of financial resources, this \ngrant has the potential to enable infrastructure development that will be important in attracting \ninvestors to the free trade zone area. \n6.  Section 42 of the Organic Law provides that a provincial legislature may make laws on \n(i)  mobile  trading;  (ii)  primary,  secondary,  technical,  and  vocational  education,  but  not \ncurriculum; (iii) sale and distribution of alcohol; (iv) public entertainment; (v) culture and cultural \ncenters; (vi) museums and libraries; (vii) sport and recreation; (viii) tourism; (ix) village and \nurban  or  community  courts;  (x)  community,  urban,  and  rural  development;  (xi)  agriculture; \n(xii) fishing  and  fisheries;  (xiii)  trade  and  industry  within  the  province;  (xiv)  rural  health; \n                                                 \n1 Government of Papua New Guinea. 2004.

This section is a very powerful legislative tool to allow WSP to tailor specific provincial \nlegislations and policies to its circumstances to encourage investment. For example, items (i), \n(viii), (x), (xiii), (xvi), (xvii), and (xviii) are all areas where specific provincial legislations and \npolicies could be developed to facilitate trade and investment.  \n8.  For example, town and urban planning regulations could be tailored to provide favorable \nplanning provisions to attract developers. This is not to say that planning provisions could be \nrelaxed to facilitate unsustainable and inappropriate development; rather, planning regulations \ncould  more  clearly  identify  areas  suited  for  particular  types  of  development  to  encourage \ninvestment. Planning provisions should also align and be consistent with areas identified as free \ntrade zones or special economic zones. \n9.  Like most provinces, WSP has not made use of any of these positive policy opportunities \nprovided for under the Organic Law, and has not passed any provincial legislation since the \nintroduction of the Organic Law. \n \nC.  Investment Promotion Act  \n10.  The Investment Promotion Act aims to promote investment in the interests of national, \nsocial, and economic development, and for that purpose, to establish a body to be known as the \nInvestment Promotion Authority (IPA). The specific purposes of the act are to \n(i)  promote and facilitate investment in the country by citizens and foreign investors; \n(ii)  provide for the grant of a certificate to a foreign enterprise;  \n(iii)  define the activities open to a foreign investor;  \n(iv)  provide for a register of foreign investment opportunities;  \n(v)  promote investments that will materially benefit the country and its people; \n(vi)  monitor the impact of investment and the activities of enterprises; and \n(vii)  establish the IPA to assist the state in achieving the purposes.  \n11.  The purposes of the Investment Promotion Act are sound, with the broad objectives of \nfacilitating investment and trade. However, in practice, many procedural aspects of the act are \nobstacles to investment, particularly foreign direct investment. \n12.  Some of the roles of the IPA (section 6) include \n(i)  providing information to investors in the country and overseas;  \n(ii)  encouraging and facilitating investment in the country by assisting investors to \nobtain all necessary licenses, compliances, and approvals;  \n(iii)  facilitating the introduction of citizens and foreign investors to each other and to \nactivities and investments of mutual benefit;  \n ", "    Appendix 3  33   \n(iv)  providing a system of certification of a foreign enterprise and requiring that a \nforeign enterprise may only carry on business if so certified; and \n(v)  monitoring the activities of foreign enterprises to determine whether a foreign \nenterprise is certified and complies with the terms and conditions of its certificate \nto carry on business in the country.  \n13.  While the IPA has delivered item (i), although the capacity of the IPA in Vanimo is \nlimited, the other four roles actually inhibit rather than promote investment. \n14.  With respect to item (ii), the Investment Promotion Act requires a raft of approvals and \nlicenses, in addition to approvals required under other acts. For example, a foreign investor \nwishing to construct a tuna packaging plant in Vanimo will not only be required to obtain \nplanning and building approval for the land use and building works, but also need to obtain a \nlicense for the activity if it is within the free trade zone area, and ensure the company is \nregistered under the Companies Act, 1997 and then also meet the stringent requirements and \nassessment under the Investment Promotion Act. \n15.  The IPA, in its Investment Promotion Regulation, 1992, defined types of activities that \nare reserved to PNG citizens and national enterprises. The list of such reserved activities\u2014\n\u201ccottage-based activities\u201d\u2014includes many small business industries, where foreign investment \ncould very well promote overall economic growth of the country, and in particular could result in \nincreased employment in some of the less developed provinces.  \n16.  The IPA procedures for foreign direct investment approval lack clarity and transparency, \nand have consequently left IPA vulnerable to accusations of political influence and corruption. \nUncertainty  about  the  future  shape  of  investment  conditions,  including  the  structure  of \nincentives, is likely to compound the unattractiveness for foreign investment. \nD.  Free Trade Zone Act  \n17.  The Free Trade Zone (FTZ) Act was developed by the Government to establish the \nframework and mechanism for the creation, operation, administration, and coordination of free \ntrade zones in PNG; and to make provision for the creation and establishment of authorities in \nrespect of such free trade zones and for the conferral upon such authorities of statutory powers \nand functions relating to the management, control, and regulation of such free trade zones and \nfor related purposes.2 \n18.  The processes of the FTZ Act that lead to development and subsequently trade and \ninvestment are as follows: \n(i)  Declaration of an area of a province as a free commercial or free industrial zone \n(section 3). \n(ii)  After  consultation  with  the  provincial  administration,  appoint  a  company \nincorporated  under  the  Companies  Act,  1997,  as  an  authority  for  the  FTZ \n(section 4). \n(iii)  The appointed authority has the following functions (section 6): \n                                                 \n2 Government of Papua New Guinea. 2000. Free Trade Zones Act 2000. Port Moresby. \n ", "34  Appendix 3 \n(a)  establishment and maintenance of the framework and mechanisms for \nthe integration, coordination, planning, monitoring, management, and \nregulation of the FTZ; \n(b)  transformation of the FTZ into a highly developed agro-financial center \nproviding efficient and effective services to commercial enterprises; \n(c)  promotion of the flow of investors, both foreign and local, into the free \ntrade zone and the provision of linkages among industries in and around \nthe FTZ; \n(d)  stimulation and generation of capital within the FTZ by providing an \nattractive climate conducive to the development of business enterprises \nand incentives for business activities; and \n(e)  fostering and promotion of financial and industrial cooperation with other \nFTZs in the country and between PNG and other industrialized countries. \n(iv)  The ownership of the company appointed by the authority must consist of at least \na 50% share held by the provincial government, at least a 20% share held by \nlandowners to which the FTZ declaration covers, and the state has the right, not \nobligation, to acquire no more than 30% (section 8). \n(v)  Goods imported to or exported from an FTZ are exempted from customs or \nexcise duty or other tax imposed under a relevant applicable law (section 11). \n(vi)  The Minister for Commerce and Industry must make a declaration approving \nauthorized activities that can be conducted in the FTZ (section 13). \n(vii)  A person or company must not deal or dispose of goods within a FTZ unless it is \nin accordance with an authorized activity and in accordance with a license or \npermit issued under the FTZ Act (section 14). \n(viii)  Application for the license or permit must be to the authority (section 21) and can \nonly be issued for a maximum period of 12 months (section 23). \n(ix)  Section 26 provides for a mechanism for appeal to the Minister for Commerce \nand Industry about a license application decision by the authority. \n(x)  Part 5 of the FTZ Act provides for the Minister for Commerce and Industry to \nadvertise  and  grant  leases  on  land  within  the  FTZ.  Depending  on  whether \nbuilding works are required, the lease may be either a maximum of 10 or 40 \nyears. \n19.  The FTZ Act has excellent policy objectives in terms of attempting to promote trade and \ninvestment.  However,  the  reality  on  the  ground  is  that  there  has  been  no  development \nassociated with the declaration of the FTZ Act in 9 years in WSP. \n20.  The Companies Office records indicate that Sandaun Trade Development Limited with a \nbusiness name of Sandaun Trade Development Authority existed for a number of years, but \nwas never appointed by the minister as an FTZ authority in accordance with section 4 of the \nFTZ Act. Furthermore, Sandaun Trade Development Limited has since been de-registered as a \nlegal entity. \n \n21.  The requirement to appoint an authority is considered to be too resource-intensive. For \nan authority to be required to receive, assess, and issue licenses and permits, it must have \nadequate capacity and resources. The mandate of the authority also duplicates already existing \napproval mechanisms, such as IPA and planning and building approvals for development. \n \n22.  The fact that a lease can be granted for up to 40 years is a positive step in terms of \ngranting security of land tenure to a potential developer, but this is offset somewhat by the fact \nthat under section 23 of the FTZ Act, licenses have a maximum lifespan of 12 months. It is \n ", "    Appendix 3  35   \ndifficult to understand the merit in having a lease for 40 years yet a license that must be \napproved annually by the authority. This does not promote investors\u2019 confidence. \n \nE.  Customs Act (presently being amended) \n \n23.  The Customs Act sets out the administrative policies and procedures for external trade \nin PNG, including cross-border trade through the Wutung border crossing in WSP. It also sets \nout the policies and procedures for fiscal administration of external trade in the province. \n \n24.  PNG has been an active member of the World Customs Organization since 2002. It has \ncompleted the necessary legislative changes to implement practices and procedures based on \nglobal standards approved by the World Customs Organization and is striving to accede to the \nRevised Kyoto Convention for the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures by \n2009. The revisions to the Customs Act with respect to administrative appeals, advance binding \nrulings, a code of ethics and conduct, and post-clearance audit are significant and will result in \nexcellent  improvements.  They  were  passed  by  Parliament  in  November  2006 and  were \nintended to be effective from January 2007 through the budgetary amendments. However, the \nSpeaker of Parliament has yet to certify the amendments, and consequently, the amendments \nhave yet to be formally announced and an updated act published. \n \n25.  PNG Customs Service has established a customs review tribunal, which is to provide an \nindependent adjudication of appeals lodged by a trader. This is one of the best actions by \ncustoms. Provisions should be made for publication of decisions of the tribunal that are of \ngeneral application, in accordance with the principles of the Revised Kyoto Convention. While \nthis policy establishes time limits for lodging an appeal to the tribunal and for lodging an appeal \nto the courts on a decision by the tribunal, there should be a time limit obligation on the tribunal \nto render a timely decision on its cases (e.g., within 60 or 90 days of the time that an appeal is \nheard). \n \nF.  Land Tenure and Security \n \n26.  PNG\u2019s customary land tenure system is firmly entrenched in the nation\u2019s culture, and is \nrecognized in the legal system. It underpins village farming systems and provides a welfare \nsafety net for the majority of people in provincial areas. Customary land ownership is a major \nconstraint to economic development. \n \n27.  As a general rule, customary land cannot be used as collateral by landowners seeking \ninvestment funds because of the absence of secure legal tenure. Individual landowners have \nlittle incentive to improve the land if the resulting benefits accrue to a large number of people \nwho did not contribute to the improvement effort. Mobilizing customary land for large-scale \neconomic projects is costly, time-consuming, and uncertain. \n \n28.  The current legal land reform initiative before Parliament is aimed at settling land title \ndisputes.  The  legislation  is  designed  to  make  the  process  of  gaining  secure  access  to \ncustomary land easier, through improvements in land administration processes, settlements of \ndisputes, and development of the institutional framework for a viable land market, including \nlong-term leases. It is intended that decisions on land use are devolved to the landowning social \nunit,  the  collective  body  claiming  rights  to  the  land  by  customary  law.  The  incorporated \nlandowning social unit is the forum for decisions about the use of land by customary law and \nnow by statute. The new law provides a framework for progress in making more productive use \nof customary land. \n ", "36  Appendix 3 \n29.  Various options for land tenure are embedded in the law: lease\u2013lease back, land tenure \nconversion, state acquisition, and customary development land (the new creation under the \nlegislation).  Incentives  are  built  in  through  the  legislation  to  give  the  various  levels  of \ngovernment, as well as landowning units, motivation to make more productive use of land\u2014in \nparticular, there is sharing of taxes collected with respect to the leasing and use of land. This \nwill give incentives to local and provincial governments to develop infrastructure to attract \ninvestment in customary land under their jurisdiction. It will also give landowning units incentives \nto overcome disagreements in order to mobilize the land for investment\u2014by themselves or by \nothers. \n \nG.  Trade Agreement between the Government of Indonesia and the Government of \nPapua New Guinea  \n \n30.  The trade agreement between the Government of Indonesia and the Government of \nPapua New Guinea, 2000 provides for the following: \n \n(i)  an undertaking to facilitate trade for business persons; \n(ii)  an offer of \u201cmost favored nation treatment\u201d on trade between the two parties; \n(iii)  exclusion of preferential treatment offered by either party to other trade partners; \n(iv)  the requirement to comply with domestic laws in both parties; \n(v)  the facilitation of trade fairs; \n(vi)  arrangement that payments for trade in goods and services be made in freely \nconvertible currencies; \n(vii)  consultations between the parties on any problems of market access; \n(viii)  establishment of a joint trade committee to deal with any difficulties related to the \ntrade in goods; \n(ix)  confirmation that national quarantine provisions of each party apply to trade in \ngoods; and \n(x)  protection of each other\u2019s intellectual property rights. \n \n31.  This agreement is rather routine, and reaffirms rights and obligations already covered \nunder PNG\u2019s and Indonesia\u2019s membership in the World Trade Organization. The agreement \ndoes very little to actively promote and facilitate new trade and investment between Indonesia \nand PNG, which is constrained by many other regulatory aspects. \n \nH.   Labor Law (Employment of Non-Citizens Act) \n \n32.  The purpose of the Employment of Non-Citizens Act is to provide a balance between the \nneeds of the economy for foreign labour and the aspirations of Papua New Guineans for decent \nwork  by (i)  assisting  business  to  attract  and  retain  the  services  of  qualified,  skilled  and \nexperienced non-citizens without unnecessary impediments; and (ii) promoting a work permit \nsystem  that  contributes  to  the  creation  of  employment,  training  and  skills-acquisition \nopportunities for all Papua New Guineans.  \n \n33.  The purpose of this act attempts to strike a balance between providing a regulatory \nframework that allows businesses to engage the services of noncitizens where required without \nunnecessary impediments, yet also ensure that the importation of foreign labor, both skilled and \nunskilled,  does  not  disadvantage  Papua  New  Guineans  in  terms  of  causing  local \nunemployment. Key aspects of this act are as follows:  \n \n ", "    Appendix 3  37   \n(i)  The hiring of a noncitizen requires an approval to recruit from the Department of \nLabour  and  Industrial  Relations,  as  well  as  a  work  permit  for  the  relevant \nnoncitizen employee.  \n(ii)  Work  permits  are  generally  available  for  noncitizens  with  management, \nprofessional, or technical skills, although they are usually only issued for a limited \nperiod. Applicants must be conversant with English, Pidgin, or Motu. Once a \nwork permit has been granted, an employment visa is issued by the Department \nof Foreign Affairs on application by the holder of the work permit. Work permits \nare usually for 3 years and cover a particular position. The employee working in \nthe position can be replaced without approval. Work permits are only issued after \nthe employee has arrived in PNG. \n(iii)  Noncitizens who require entry into PNG for business reasons (but not to work) \ncan apply for a 12-month multiple entry (60 days at a time) business visa. \n(iv)  There is also a recently introduced entry permit class known as the working \nresident entry permits. These are temporary permits that may be granted to \nemployees of major development project companies prior to a work permit being \nobtained. Application must be made to the Immigration and Citizenship Division \nof the Department of Foreign Affairs.  \n(v)  Some jobs are reserved exclusively for citizens and one of the conditions of \nemploying foreign workers is that the employer must train citizens to improve \ntheir skills and equip them to take over from the foreign workers. A training levy is \nimposed on most employees to achieve this end. Specific occupations, covering \n578 vocation codes out of a total of 1,048, are reserved for nationals.  \n \n34.  A study undertaken by the IFC3 indicated that obtaining a noncitizen work permit can \ntake 6 months and cost K5,000 and there is anecdotal evidence of corrupt practices. Discretion \nis also exercised in the associated visa approvals process. A further impediment is that staff \nnationalization plans are required up-front before permits are issued.  \n \n35.  Requirements of the Employment of Non-Citizens Act are politically appealing, but may \nhave kept large numbers of people unemployed because of lack of investment. It needs to be \nrealized that skill transfer does not only depend on trainers, but also the capacity of trainees. \nEducation is the ultimate way of creating a skilled labor force.  \n \n36.  Timely and efficient accessibility to noncitizen workers, particularly in remote regions \nsuch as Vanimo, is important to business where specific labor skills may not exist within the \nlocal labor market. \n                                                 \n3  International Finance Corporation. 2003.

Introduction.  The capacity assessment is carried out from an institutional economics \npoint of view, according to which institutions including informal and formal rules are the key to \nexplaining different economic performance across countries. To promote trade and private \ninvestment, it is essential to understand the current institutions of Papua New Guinea (PNG) \nand design appropriate interventions accordingly.  \n \n2.  Informal rules. PNG is linguistically and culturally diverse, with more than 800 ethnic \ngroups.  While  this  is  certainly  an  advantage,  it  poses  challenges  to  communication, \nunderstanding, social harmony, collective decisions in the interest of the majority, and nation \nbuilding. The wantok system, customary land ownership, and the \u201cask and give\u201d culture suit \nsubsistence gardening production well and provide a social safety net. However, they hamper \nmodern governance that requires government be impartial to develop and enforce laws and \nregulations, and business development which requires clear property rights and thrift and saving \nfor business growth.  \n \n3.  Formal rules. PNG\u2019s laws and regulations are characterized by overcentralization and \nprotection of nationals. Construction contracts are between the state and contractors. Contracts \nwith values above K10 million need to go through 32 procedures before the approval of the \nNational  Executive  Council,  the  cabinet.  Foreign  investment  approval  is  centralized  at  the \nInvestment Promotion Authority (IPA), which has to certify the financial and operational capacity \nof the foreign investors regardless of the investment amount. This also applies to company \nregistration. Approval of work permits and visas and issuance of passports are all centralized in \nPort Moresby, and require months of waiting time. Compounded by the underdeveloped and \ncostly transport and telecommunication infrastructure, administrative discretions, and shortage \nof funding and staff, compliance with the formal rules is expensive and time-consuming and has \nbecome a major hindrance to trade and investment. Detailed assessment of the regulatory \nframework governing trade and investment is in Appendix 3.  \n \n4.  The \u201ccottage list\u201d that restricts a list of business activities to nationals, investment and \nlabor laws that require hiring one international staff with three nationals and up-front localization \nprograms, and the minimum wage requirements are understandable and politically appealing. \nHowever, they reduce the attractiveness and competitiveness of PNG as a destination for \nforeign investment because these requirements translate into costs. Lack of foreign investment \nin the agriculture, manufacturing, and service sectors means job loss, a sluggish economic \ngrowth pattern, slow technical and skill development, and persistent subsistence farming.  \n \n5.  Information  on  the  Government\u2019s  policies,  rules,  and  regulations  is  not  generally \navailable to the public, particularly in their totality. No single source of information describes the \nregulatory  approval  procedures  and  trade,  tariff,  customs,  quarantine,  immigration,  foreign \nexchange, and tax policies. Unclear legal and regulatory requirements provide opportunities for \nrent-seeking activities and cause major delays and compliance costs.  \n \n6.  Organizational capacity. There are 26 national departments, 34 statutory authorities, \nand 20 provincial governments in PNG. West Sepik Province (WSP) has 17 provincial and local \ngovernments.  More  than  50%  of the  recurrent  budget  went  to  consumption  of goods  and \nservices by the Government. Intergovernmental relations and responsibilities between provincial \nand  local  governments  are  unclear.  Policies  and  decisions  made  at  high  levels  may  not \nnecessarily be implemented at the operational levels. There seems to be a shortage of staff and \n ", "40  Appendix 5 \nfunding across government departments. The customs officers at Wutung border have served in \ntheir posts for 8\u201310 years and were not able to be rotated because of funding constraints.  \n \n7.  The Commerce Division of West Sepik Provincial Administration has two staff members. \nIn 2007, its budget allocation was K12,000. The Physical Planning Board and Building Board \nare  the  two  local  authorities  for  granting  construction  permits.  According  to  the  Physical \nPlanning Act, 1989 and Building Board Act, 1978; the two boards should hold a meeting once a \nmonth but only two or three meetings were held annually in the past years.  \n \n8.  The  Border  Development  Authority  (BDA)  was  established  in  October  2008.  It  has \nmandates to coordinate development activities, provide infrastructure, and promote both foreign \nand local investment in the border provinces. Of 150 positions, it has filled 28 positions including \nkey positions such as the executive chair, general manager, corporate director, planning and \nimplementation director, and human resource manager. Even when all positions are filled, BDA \nwill require capacity development in project management, procurement, project evaluation and \nreporting, project supervision and monitoring, financial management, and investment promotion \nto carry out its mandates as well as the responsibilities of the Executing Agency for the Project.  \n \n9.  PNG Customs Service has made substantial progress toward acceding to the Revised \nKyoto Convention for Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures and has set an \nexample in the Pacific. However, according to the diagnostic report of the World Customs \nOrganization, it needs to upgrade its information technology infrastructure and strengthen law \nenforcement capability to further improve its clearance efficiency and facilitate trade. \n \n10.  Human capacity. The adult literacy rate for PNG is 57.3% and the combined primary, \nsecondary, and tertiary gross enrollment ratio is 40.7%. Life expectancy at birth is 57 years. For \nWSP, the adult literacy rate is around 45% and life expectancy at birth is 46 years. Skills \nshortage exists in almost all professions\u2014particularly policy strategists, managers, mining and \ncivil engineers, geologists, financial controllers, and information technology specialists. The \nskilled labor requirement of the liquefied natural gas project, which is anticipated to be 8,000 in \nthe medium term, will further aggravate the labor market.  \n \n11.  Human capacity is not just about skill, but also work ethics. It seems fairly common that \nin PNG, a skilled worker fails to catch his flight, turn up at a scheduled meeting, deliver his \npromise; and may even disappear under a contract.  \n \n12.  People in Vanimo and Wutung border acknowledges that trade with Indonesia is an \nopportunity. However, they fear they may not be able to participate because they do not have \nthe fundamental perspectives, culture, or experience with trade and formal business enterprise. \nThey  have  specifically  requested  entrepreneurship  training  and  technical  and  vocational \nbusiness training with respect to starting a business; registering a business; knowledge of a \npotential market; understanding of technology; capacity to manage books and records; skills in \nrecruiting, training, deploying, and managing employees; and paying taxes.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 6  41 \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A6.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n(K million)    ($ million) \nForeign  Local  Total  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

To complement the Project, technical assistance (TA) is needed to reduce business \ntransaction  costs  associated  with  compliance  with  government  rules  and  regulations  and \ntelecommunication so that the business environment in West Sepik Province (WSP) is improved \nand attractive to private investment. As a new establishment and executing agency for the \nProject, the Border Development Authority (BDA) will need assistance to build its capacity to \nimplement the Project. The TA will consist of three parts: (i) development of investment policy \nlegislation  for  WSP,  (ii)  study  of  telecommunication  options  for  WSP,  and  (iii) capacity \ndevelopment in the areas of procurement and financial management for BDA.  \n \nA.  Development of Investment Policy Legislation for WSP \n \n2.  To capture the trade opportunity with Indonesia and worldwide, WSP needs to attract \ninvestment to expand production, increase supplies of its marketable products, and promote \ntourism. However, WSP faces formidable challenges at both national and provincial levels to \nimprove the investment climate. Unless deliberate government investment policies are provided \nand economic activities are stimulated, the chance of development will be slim and investment \nin border facilities may be wasted. \n \n3.  Policy development needs to be internally driven. The TA will provide an investment \npolicy  strategist  (international,  18  person-months)  to  assist  a  government  policy  team  in \ndeveloping investment policy legislation for WSP. Responsibilities include but are not limited to \nthe following: \n(i)  Assisting BDA in establishing a well-motivated and dedicated policy team led by \nsenior government officials. \n(ii)  Introducing to the policy team the most recent successful country experience in \ninvestment promotion in Asia and the Pacific, particularly the experience of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, or some \nother countries.  \n(iii)  Developing  overseas  short  visit  plans  and  agenda,  and  organizing overseas \ntours  to  expose  the  policy  team  to  successful  experiences  in  investment \npromotion in Asia and the Pacific. \n(iv)  Assisting the policy team in preparing the reports of the study tours. \n(v)  Assisting  the  policy  team  in  reviewing  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  laws  and \nregulations governing foreign and national investment, and related constraints \nsuch as land.  \n(vi)  Assisting the policy team in developing an investment act for WSP. \n(vii)  Organizing  workshops  with  the  participation  of  distinguished  political  and \nbusiness leaders and development partners to advise on the investment act. \n(viii)  Assisting BDA in the Government\u2019s approval of the investment policy legislation \nand pilot testing in WSP.  \n(ix)  Assisting  BDA  in  developing  an  information  guide  to  the  act,  customs, \nimmigration,  quarantine,  tariff,  taxes,  business  registration,  land,  construction \npermit, etc.  \n \n4.  The investment policy strategist needs to have extensive investment promotion and \ncountry experience. The output will be the approved investment policy legislation for WSP. \n ", "50  Appendix 9 \nReporting requirements include (i) monthly progress reports to be submitted in the first week of \nthe following month, (ii) a draft final report, and (iii) a final report.  \n \nB.  Study of Telecommunication Strategy for WSP \n \n5.  Background.  Telecommunication  is  a  regulated  sector  in  PNG.  The  Independent \nConsumer and Competition Commission (ICCC) handles the regulatory requirements related to \nthe Telecommunications Act, 1996. ICCC provides the telecom regulatory contract and Pangtel \nprovides any technical regulations. ICCC and Pangtel have concurrent powers and they are \nrequired to consult each other. In the event of any disagreement, the decisions of ICCC will \nprevail.  \n \n6.  Telikom PNG is the corporate entity set by the Government as the sole provider of \ntelecommunication  services,  and  it  abides  by  the  ICCC  regulatory  contract.  Telikom  PNG \nprovides voice, internet, and data services.  \n \n7.  A subsidiary of Telikom PNG, Pacific Mobile Communications provides the internet \ngateway services. Tiara Internet Gateway (under Pacific Mobile Communications) provides \nservices  to  the  internet  service  provider.  Telikom  PNG  is  also  active  in  the  mobile \ncommunication sector, using another subsidiary B-Mobile. \n \n8.  The mobile phone sector is partially open for competition, with Digicel offering mobile \nphone services along with B-Mobile. There is a third company, Green Com, whose operations \nhave not been very successful. According to some media reports, a major stakeholder has left \nthe company, leaving the operations to deteriorate.  \n \n9.  The country\u2019s domain space of (.pg) is administered by Papua New Guinea University of \nTechnology  in  Lae.  Five  internet  service  providers  are  licensed:  DG  Computers,  Global \nTechnologies, Online South Pacific, Daltron Electronics, and Datec. \n \n10.  The country\u2019s main internet pipe connects Port Moresby to Australia and is owned by \nTelikom PNG. Pacific Mobile Communications operates this gateway and leases the gateway \nfor use to the internet service providers.  \n \n11.  Another internet pipe (Pipe Pacific Cable 1), under construction by Australia\u2019s Pipe \nNetworks, is expected to be commissioned later this year. It connects Sydney to Guam and \nprovides onward connectivity to the United States and Asia. This will have connectivity to Lae, \nthus providing another internet gateway. \n  \n12.  In 2008, PNG\u2019s Academic and Research Network became operational, and connects to \nAsiaSat 4 through a teleport hub in Singapore. This network is operated by a consortium and \nmaintained by a local team. Members of this private network include the Education Department, \nOffice of Libraries and Archives, Papua New Guinea University of Technology, University of \nPapua New Guinea, Vudal University, Goroka University, Pacific Adventist University, Divine \nWord University, National Research Institute, National Agriculture Research Institute, and Office \nof Higher Education. \n \n13.  A major recent development is the new information and communication technology (ICT) \npolicy for the telecommunications sector that was released in April 2009. According to the \npolicy, the responsibilities of ICCC and Pangtel will be merged and managed under a new \nregulatory structure. The internet gateway will open to more operators other than Telikom PNG. \n ", "    Appendix 9  51 \nA universal access scheme, which is taking telecommunications to less-developed areas, will be \ngiven importance. These changes are sweeping and are expected to change the marketplace. \n14.  Scope of study. The scope of the study is to investigate telecommunication options for \nWSP that can promote trade and investment, be used by BDA and customs, and stimulate \noverall  economic  activities  in  the  province\u2014taking  into  consideration  the  current \ntelecommunication  infrastructure,  emerging  trends  in  the  Pacific  region,  the  status  of \nimplementation of ICT policy, applicability of the technology in WSP, and affordability. \n \n15.  Objectives. The objective of this study is to evolve a telecommunication technology \nstrategy for WSP by (i) evaluating the progress of the new telecommunication policy and its \npossible  extension  to  WSP,  and  (ii)  evaluating  all  available  and  possible  technologies  for \ndeployment of telecommunication services in WSP. \n \n16.  Terms  of  reference  for  telecommunications  specialist  (international,  4  person-\nmonths). The specialist will be responsible for the following:  \n \n(i)  Surveying  the  telecommunication  infrastructure  available  in  PNG,  including \ninfrastructure for mobile communications, internet connectivity, rural connectivity, \nespecially in WSP, and communication methods used (radio, satellite, etc). The \nproviders to be covered are Telikom PNG, B Mobile, Digicel, and any other \ncarrier licensed since May 2009. \n(ii)  Studying PNG\u2019s ICT policy and reporting on the progress of the implementation \nof the policy at the time of the study. The report should cover but not be limited to \nthe state of governance bodies set up, high-level details of obtaining operator \nlicenses under the new scheme, details of the new operators, their infrastructure \nand schemes, and especially progress of the universal access scheme. \n(iii)  Understanding the infrastructure and services provided by the academic and \neducational network operated by PNG Academic and Research Network, and \nexploring the feasibility of piggybacking this network for development activities in \nWSP. \n(iv)  Documenting the information on the telecommunication backbone provided by \nthe  main  carrier  and  operator,  Telikom  PNG,  and  other  mobile  operators \navailable at the time of the study. \n(v)  Exploring the feasibility of using the telecommunication infrastructure available in \nneighboring Indonesia, as Vanimo, the capital of WSP, is very close to Jayapura, \nIndonesia. Identifying if a network pipe is available in Jayapura that can be used \nfor  expansion  in  Vanimo  for  internet  communication.  Identifying  if  technical \nfeasibility exists for internet connectivity, and if it exists, exploring if the new PNG \ntelecommunication policy will allow such expansions, either as a joint exercise \nbetween Indonesian telecom and Telikom PNG or through a new business entity. \n(vi)  Developing a comprehensive telecom strategy for WSP based on the information \ncollected. The strategy should first address internet access for businesses and \ngovernment  establishments  in  Vanimo  and  possibly  end  users,  and  second \nimproving voice communication facilities in and around Vanimo. \n(vii)  Developing  various  options  for  implementation  of  the  strategy  (such  as \naugmenting  existing  infrastructure,  providing  new  infrastructure,  and \npiggybacking available infrastructure) from within the region and country as well \nas across the border, from Indonesia. \n ", "52  Appendix 9 \n(viii)  Analyzing the viability of each option, taking into consideration the benefits, cost, \nand technological viability. Develop costing models for various options so that \noptions can be compared and one or many selected for implementation. \n \n17.  Outputs. The study report should broadly consist of the following: \n  \n(i)  Details of available telecommunication infrastructure in PNG, taking into \nconsideration any recent or anticipated changes. \n(ii)  Technology  options  analysis  for  expanding  telecommunication \ninfrastructure  in  WSP,  especially  in  Vanimo  town  and  a  technology \nstrategy  built  around  this  feasibility.  The  analysis  should  take  into \nconsideration the changes in ICT policy and the capabilities provided by \nvarious operators including those in Indonesia but not limited to Telikom \nPNG, Digicel, and the PNG Academic and Research Network. \n(iii)  Cost models and viability analysis for various options so that one or more \noptions can be adopted for implementation. \n \nC.  Capacity Development for BDA \n \n18.

Development literature and country experiences indicate that trade and investment are \nan engine of economic growth and play an important role in poverty reduction. This is because \n(i) trade  encourages  specialization  according  to  comparative  advantages,  enabling  efficient \ndeployment of national resources; (ii) trade expands markets; (iii) trade disseminates ideas, \nmanagement  and  organization  skills,  and  technology,  increasing  productivity  of  local \nbusinesses; (iv) trade  generates investment  essential for employment; and (v) trade gives \nconsumers access to a wider range of products at cheaper prices. \n \n2.  The volume of international trade has not reached its optimal level based on differences \nin factor endowments, tastes, and technology between countries, even after a global reduction \nin  average  tariff  and  non-tariff  barriers.  The  lower  than  expected  trade  volume  is  more \npronounced in case of trade between neighboring developing countries, often evident from \nsubstantial price differences between such countries. Trade transaction costs (TTCs) have been \noffered as a possible explanation of this shortfall. The most obvious examples of TTCs are (i) a \ntruck carrying goods for trade across the border will charge more for plying on a poor road or for \na long waiting time, thus increasing the monetary costs of the goods; (ii) lack of warehousing \nfacilities would result in loss, damage, and spoilage of goods in transit and may increase \ninsurance charges; and (iii) lack of access to good transport and communication services may \nimpose a high opportunity cost by restricting market access. Empirical estimates using a gravity \nequation  found  that  the  tax  equivalent  of  such  TTCs  could  be  as  high  as  74% \n(21% transportation,  44%  border-related  costs)  for  industrialized  countries.1  Costs  for \ndeveloping countries could be even higher.   \n \n3.  West Sepik Province (WSP) borders Papua Province of Indonesia, which offers 25%\u2013\n40% cheaper services and products. Trade across the border has taken place but is limited by \nthe closure of the Bewani\u2013Vanimo\u2013Jayapura road as the border facilities at Wutung, WSP are \nnot  ready  for  handling  vehicle  crossing.  With  the  Project,  a  modern  border  facility \naccommodating traffic flows will be built to facilitate trade. Such trade facilitation will lead to a \nreduction in TTCs, encouraging exports and imports from and to Papua New Guinea (PNG); \nand resulting in a net gain in producer surplus, consumer surplus, and incremental government \nrevenues  from  exports  and  imports.  The  social  development  program  of  the  Project  is  to \nmitigate the social risks and comply with ADB\u2019s social policies. The social development program \nwas designed based on people\u2019s priorities\u2014health and education. \n \n4.  Alternative ways to promote trade have been considered and found unfeasible. The \nroom for further tariff reduction is very limited as PNG already has one of the least restrictive \ntrade regimes in the Pacific region. Compared with other constraints, such as infrastructure and \ngovernment investment policies and administrative practices, tariffs are a less binding constraint \nrestricting trade. \n \n5.  Renovation of the current administration building will not help resolve the issue of traffic \nflow. The Wutung border area needs to be re-planned and new facilities need to be built to \nreduce TTCs associated with transportation, storage, and communications.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Anderson, James, and Eric van Wincoop. 2004. Trade Costs. Journal of Economic Literature. Vol. 42 (September \n2004): page 692. \n ", "                Appendix 10  55 \n6.  The economic analysis of the Project was conducted by comparing the \u201cwith-project\u201d and \n\u201cwithout-project\u201d scenarios. The assessment covers the period from 2010 to 2034 and assumes \nthe implementation schedule in Appendix 7 is followed. All benefits and costs are in constant \n2009 prices. The analysis excluded economic benefits such as business efficiency, job creation, \nskill development, and reduction in income differential between towns far from the border and \ntowns neighboring the border, which are difficult to quantify. \n \nB.  Costs \n \n7.  Project economic costs include civil works costs, equipment costs, consulting service \ncosts, physical contingency, and maintenance costs. The economic cost of land is not included \nbecause there is no incremental cost between with- and without-project scenarios, as the land \nhas been allocated for border development. Taxes and duties are excluded from the economic \nassessment. Costs were divided into tradable and non-tradable components. The non-tradable \ncomponents are made of domestic labor, materials, and other expenses, and are estimated to \nrepresent 73% of the costs. Costs for skilled and unskilled domestic labor were adjusted by a \nshadow wage rate factor of 0.95 and 0.50 respectively to arrive at the economic opportunity \ncost. A standard conversion factor of 0.95 was applied to calculate the economic price of other \nnon-traded goods, and to estimate the opportunity cost of maintenance costs. \n \nC.  Benefits \n \n8.  Without the Project, TTCs associated with loss, damage, and spoilage of goods in \ntransit; lack of access to transport and communication services; and market access restrictions \nwill be high\u2014equivalent to a tax of at least 25%. The Project will reduce the TTCs and increase \nthe volume of trade. The total increase in trade can be estimated from the price elasticity of \nexports and the price elasticity of imports. As the trade considered here is bilateral, the price \nelasticity  of  both  exports  and  imports  is  expected  to  be  higher  than  the  multilateral  price \nelasticity of both exports and imports. We have assumed the price elasticity of demand for both \nimports and exports to be 1.55. Another important assumption made in the benefit estimates of \nthe border facilities is a reduction in TTCs by 12%. \n  \n9.  The benefits of the social development program are also significant. Providing electricity \nimproves the quality of life of the households connected with electricity, and decreases the cost \nof using other sources of fuel. In PNG, the willingness to pay for electricity is K1 per kilowatt-\nhour (kWh). The tariff per kWh is equivalent to $0.20. Sanitation reduces both morbidity and \nmortality,  especially  for  children  under  5.  Fewer  ailments  reduce  the  portion  of  household \nincome spent on treating waterborne diseases. Safe motherhood reduces both maternal and \nchild mortality. A reduction in school dropout rates increases social benefits, as the income \ndifferential between a person with a school education and a person without a school education \nis substantial. Reduction in HIV/AIDS prevalence increases the household income by reducing \nthe expenditure on treatment. It also saves lives. To estimate the economic value of life saved \nby the social development program, the net value method has been adopted. To find the net \nvalue, the gross income throughout a person\u2019s life has been computed. The average annual per \ncapita income in Wutung is K2,000 and the average working life of a person is 30 years. The \ntotal income stream discounted comes to about K21,000, which is the gross income of a person. \nGross consumption is estimated to be 50% of gross income. With an assumed probability of \nsurvival of 85%, the net value of life saved is estimated to be K8,925. \n \n \n \n ", "56  Appendix 10 \nD.  Results of Economic Analysis \n \n10.  The total economic benefit from the Project is quite substantial. Discounted at a rate of \n12%, the economic net present value (NPV) of the Project is K5.52 million, and the economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is 14.05%.

Sensitivity Analysis \n \n11.  Sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effects of negative changes in the key \nparameters that determine the benefits and costs of the Project. The analysis was conducted by \nincreasing the costs and reducing the benefits. \n \n12.  Among the individual variables affecting the Project, TTCs have the highest impact on \nthe  Project.  Even  small  changes  in  TTCs  affect  the  benefits  of  the  Project  as  shown  in \nTable A10.2. \n \nTable A10.2: Impact of Trade Transaction Costs on the Project \nReduction in TTC \nbenefits (%)  ENPV (K million)  EIRR (%) \n0  5.52  14.05 \n10  2.29  12.87 \n15  0.68  12.26 \n20  (0.94)  11.64 \n25  (2.55)  11.00 \n30  (4.16)  10.34 \n35  (5.77)  9.67 \n40  (7.39)  8.98 \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, ENPV = economic net present \nvalue, TTC = trade transaction cost.            \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n13.  On the positive side, the prices in WSP are 25%\u201340% higher than those in Papua \nProvince of Indonesia. A large part of the prices is the TTC, which can be reduced by a modern \nborder  system  and  efficiency  in  operations.  A  modest  reduction  of  TTCs  can  produce \nsubstantial economic gains. For example, if TTCs are reduced by 15% instead of 12% as \nassumed in the base case, the NPV will increase by K8.11 million. Such a change will have a \nlasting impact on WSP. \n \n14.  Capital costs also have a significant impact on the economics of the Project. An increase \nin capital costs of about 15.82% reduces the NPV of the Project to zero. The impact of capital \ncosts on the entire Project is shown in Table A10.3. \n \nTable A10.3: Impact of Capital Costs on the Project \nIncrease in Capital \nCosts (%)  ENPV (K million)  EIRR (%) \n0  5.52  14.05 \n10  2.32  12.80 \n15  0.73  12.24 \n20  (0.87)  11.72 \n25  (2.47)  11.22 \n30  (4.07)  10.75 \n35  (5.67)  10.31 \n40  (7.27)  9.89 \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, ENPV = economic net present value.            \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "58  Appendix 10 \n15.  The significant impact of the increase in capital costs would call for serious efforts to \navoid cost overruns during project implementation. \n \n16.  A reduction in total benefits has a higher impact on the Project in comparison with a \nsame increase in total costs. A reduction of 12.16% in total benefits decreases the NPV of the \nProject to zero, while an increase of 13.84% in total costs decreases the NPV of the Project to \nzero. In conducting an analysis of the adverse situations the Project may face, even with either \na 10% reduction in benefits or a 10% increase in costs, the Project provides a positive NPV. In \nthe worst case scenario, where the Project suffers from both a 10% reduction in benefits and a \n10% increase in costs, the Project provides an EIRR of 10.95%. \n \nTable A10.4: Sensitivity Analysis \nNet Present \nEconomic Internal  Value   Switching \nSensitivity Test  Rate of Return (%)  (K million)  Value (%) \nBase case  14.05  5.52   \nReduce benefits by 10%  12.37  0.98  12.16 \nIncrease costs by 10%  12.53  1.53  13.84 \nIncrease costs by 10% and \nreduce benefits by 10%  10.95  (3.01)   \n( ) = negative. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n17.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \na\nImprovement of trade and investment is identified in the Medium Term Development Strategy 2005\u20132010  as a strategic \npriority to promote export-driven economic growth and rural development (including agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and \ntourism) on a sustainable basis. Encouraging trade and investment is particularly stated in the strategy\u2019s guiding principles \nunder (i) least developed areas intervention, (ii) empowering Papua New Guineans and improving skills, and (iii) \u201csweat \nequity\u201d and Papua New Guinean character. Although the draft national poverty reduction strategy is silent on trade and \ninvestment, it is indirectly incorporated in pillar three: improve and maintain physical infrastructure to facilitate access to social \nservices and income.  \n \nImprovement of trade and investment is one of the priorities of West Sepik Province (WSP) under its commerce, trade, and \nindustry plan. It is reflected in the soon-to-be finalized provincial development plan as well as the draft district development \nplans, which encourage creation of income-earning opportunities particularly in rural areas.  \n \nThe Pilot Border Trade and Investment Development Project will contribute to promoting economic growth and social \ndevelopment in WSP, with extended benefits to Manus, East Sepik, Madang and Morobe provinces by providing a trade and \ninvestment-friendly environment and improved border facilities, and encouraging the cross-border trade with Papua Province \nof Indonesia. It has the potential to translate the Bewani\u2013Vanimo\u2013Jayapura road into an economic corridor. The improved \ntrade and investment-friendly environment and improved border facilities will allow for continued and increased trade volume \nto and from Indonesia and faster and cheaper access to the large market across the border for Papua New Guinea (PNG) \nproducts such as tinned goods, coffee, vanilla, and other agricultural produce from WSP and the northern coastal region as \nwell as imports of capital goods and consumables from Indonesia and other parts of Asia. \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program for PNG, 2006\u20132010,b supported the Medium Term \nDevelopment Strategy. ADB\u2019s assistance was proposed to focus on (i) public finance management, (ii) private sector \ndevelopment, (iii) the transport sector, and (iv) health and HIV/AIDS. The Project will contribute to private sector development \nand HIV/AIDS prevention in WSP by improving the business environment and supporting nongovernment organizations\u2019 \nefforts in combating HIV/AIDS.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nPoverty estimates for PNG have not been updated since the last household survey in 1996. From 1996 to 2003, the number \nof Papua New Guineans living below $1/day is estimated to have doubled from 1.1 million to 2.2 million people. The poverty \nheadcount index for the $1/day poverty line was about 39.4% in 2003, up from 24.6% in 1996. An estimated 70% of the \npopulation, or 3.9 million Papua New Guineans, now live on less than $2/day, up from 54% in 1996. \n \nWSP\u2019s population has increased from about 130,000 in 1990 to 190,000 in 2000, with the majority (92%) of the population \nliving in rural areas. The crude population density is five people per square kilometer (km2), an increase from four persons per \nkm2 in 1990. The increasing population is placing considerable pressures on the province\u2019s capacity to effectively deliver \nbasic social services, infrastructure, and income opportunities\u2014particularly for those who live in the rural areas. This is seen \nto contribute to an increasing number of the rural population moving to urban areas and settling on illegal settlements on state \nand customary lands (58% of Vanimo communities).  \n \nIn most parts of the province, the annual per capita income is K50\u2013K70. The west coast villages have reported a higher \nincome (on average, K500 fortnightly per household or K1,000 monthly per household) than the sample urban households \n(K400 average fortnightly or K800 monthly). Given the average household size of seven, this income represents a monthly \nper capita income of about K140 or annual per capita income of K1,700. This could be explained by the proximity to the \nborder, easy access to markets, and income opportunities for these communities.  \n \n \n ", "60  Appendix 11 \nAccess to basic social services by the province\u2019s population, especially those in rural areas, is poor. About 20% of the \nprovince\u2019s aid posts in all four districts are closed; 66% of the schools are run by churches. Gender enrollment is biased \ntoward males because of cultural norms that restrict females\u2019 status or role. Access to water supply for most people in the four \ndistricts is through rainwater tanks, creeks, and streams. There are no sanitation and sewerage treatment facilities in all \ndistricts in the province. Reticulated power supply is only in Vanimo. All district centers rely on limited capacity generators, \nwhile most rural communities depend on kerosene lamps for power. Even with the reported increase in income by the west \ncoast communities, their living conditions are as poor as other parts of WSP. \n \nRoad connectivity is also poor. There is no road connection from the capital to its four districts or between the districts. There \nare only about 60 km sealed roads and about 1,400 km gravel road networks in the four districts\u2014restricting access to social \nservices and markets. In the poorest of the four districts (Telefomin), people have to walk on average 6 hours to get to the \nnearest village, district center, or market. Overall, remoteness and isolation as well as limited trade and investment activities \nplay a significant role in the low level of access to services and income opportunities, particularly for the rural people in the \nprovince. \n \nWomen provide most of the subsistence agriculture workforce. Females receive less education and medical care. Male \nchildren are allocated a far greater share of the household income than female children. Female literacy and school \nenrollment rates in the province lag well behind those of male students, particularly those in rural areas, with 16% of males \nand 13% of females aged 5 and over attending school in 2000. Similar to the national trend, even with a women\u2019s national \npolicy being approved in 1990, female participation in politics and public service management is still minimal. Domestic \nviolence against women in the province is common. \n \nThe human development indicators for the province are some of the worst for the country. The infant mortality rate is the \nfourth highest in the country at 71 per 1,000 live births\u2014higher than the national rate of 67 per 1,000 live births.c Life \nexpectancy is 45.6 for men and 46.5 for women\u2014the lowest in the country.  \n \n2. Design Features.  \n \nThe Project includes a package of assistance to address both income and non-income poverty. Construction of the border \nfacilities and promotion of trade with Indonesia and investment will help stimulate economic activities in WSP, create job \nopportunities, and increase people\u2019s income.  \n \nThe social development program targets alleviation of non-income poverty. It comprises (i) power connection for Wutung \nvillage, (ii) septic tank and individual household toilet for Wutung village, (iii) safe motherhood for five villages, (iv) education \nsupport for at-risk children for five villages, and (v) HIV/AIDS prevention. All components except (v) will be implemented \nthrough modified cash transfer (MCCT), which will transfer cash to the female head or a female adult of a household upon \ncompletion of the relevant intervention activities. HIV/AIDS prevention will be carried out by Volunteer Service Overseas \n(international nongovernment organization) to change people\u2019s behavior. The program is expected to improve people\u2019s living \nconditions significantly and support people to venture into new businesses such as tourism, and reduce infant mortality and \nmaternal deaths in the target villages. \n \nThe capacity development component includes training programs for local people who are eager to learn and catch up with \ntheir Indonesian neighbors. It will help develop entrepreneurship and business skills and strengthen local people\u2019s capability \nin participating in and benefiting from the trade opportunities with Indonesia. At least 30% of the trainees will be women. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nPrimary Beneficiaries. The primary beneficiaries of the Project will be the population of about 190,000 in WSP, 92% of \nwhom live in the rural areas. They include the following groups of people: (i) an estimated 700 households living in \ncommunities along the road connecting the border to the town of Vanimo (west coast) who sell a range of agriculture \nproduces and PNG products along the border and Indonesian goods to Vanimo town as well as those households living in \n26 residential and settlements in Vanimo urban area; (ii) drivers of public motor vehicles that provide a range of transport \nservices within Vanimo and to the border; (iii) businesses in WSP, including informal vendors, trade store owners, and the \nhospitality industry; and (v) high school and/or technical school graduates in the province who may find employment resulting \nfrom the project activities.  \n \nPoor and vulnerable groups\u2014their needs, demands, constraints, and capacity. Most of people in WSP are poor in terms \nof access to income and basic social services. There is no reticulated power supply, no functional aid posts, and no proper \ntoilets. Education is generally limited to primary school. With each new government administration, increasing access to \nincome opportunities and access to improved social services such as power, sanitation, water supply, and education continue \n ", "  Appendix 11  61 \nas their development priorities.d  \n \nPoor access to basic services, particularly health and education, and limited employment opportunities were the main \nconstraints preventing men and women including out-of-school youths in the west coast and Vanimo urban area to participate \nfully in any community and provincial development priorities. In the 2000 census, for example, there are very low proportions \nof males and females ages 5\u201329 attending school (24% males and 20% females). In particular, a higher proportion of males \nthan females had been to school and completed grade 6 for age 10 and above (67% for males and 63% for females.) This \nillustrates the overall low educational attainment in the province for both genders, particularly for women. \n \nAccording to the National AIDS Council, the HIV prevalence rate in rural PNG is predicted to jump from 2.0% to 3.5% of the \npopulation by 2010. The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) estimated that within 20 years, up to 40% \nof the adult population would be living with HIV/AIDS. WSP had a total of 119 infected persons starting from 1987 to 2007, the \n12th highest among 19 PNG provinces. More women than men are affected\u2014there are 62 female cases and 45 male cases. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nDuring the process of identifying and designing the Project, consultations were held at various levels, involving a broad range \nof stakeholder groups and over 600 individuals. The consultations were conducted in the form of (i) a large stakeholder \nworkshop; (ii) key informant interviews at provincial, district, and village levels; (iii) focus group discussions; and (iv) a set of \nsample surveys of rural (west coast) and urban (Vanimo town) households. These consultations are the basis for the social \nand poverty analyses of the proposed Project. The insights obtained through the consultations have been incorporated into \nthe project design in the form of a participation strategy in general and for women, and in the mitigation measures and \ncomplementary actions to increase the Project\u2019s benefits received by the poor and other vulnerable groups. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nExtensive consultations have been done during the project preparation phase and are being institutionalized under the Project \nthrough the project design.  \n \nThe Border Development Authority (BDA) provincial management office (PMO) in Vanimo will include a community relations \nofficer on a full-time basis. The community relations officer will (i) disseminate project information to stakeholders regularly, \nand (ii) consult with relevant provincial administration officials at various levels and villagers from Wutung and the other four \nwest coast villages with respect to the social development program of the project and training programs. The Project has \nincluded an international training specialist to develop annual training programs for 4 years in consultation with stakeholders. \nVolunteer Service Overseas will be utilized to engage people in constructive dialogues through healthy activities such as \nsports. The total budget is about $270,000. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1. Key Issues.  Although there were reported improvements in decision making in the households where couples are starting \nto make joint decisions, men are still generally the main authority who make the final decision, particularly on (i) how much is \nspent; (ii) when to stop having children; and (iii) when money is limited, which child stays in school. Men\u2019s role is so closely \ntied with economic and social status that there is still a widely held view that women without husbands are considered to be in \nhardship and are often excluded from community decision making. \n \nDespite improvements in education, women\u2019s status (including in WSP) is still low compared to that of men. Women could not \nmake independent decisions, particularly on contraception. The husband has the final say if they will use any family planning \nmethod, even in cases of life-threatening pregnancies. \n \nWith the shift from an agricultural to cash economy, facilitated by access to the border, an increasing number of women are \nstarting to join the workforce or getting involved in small-scale businesses. This places additional responsibilities and is \ncausing stress on women and the whole family.  \n \nSimilar to other women in the province, women in west coast villages have limited access to income opportunities because of \n ", "62  Appendix 11 \nlow levels of skills, lack of capital, and absence of reliable market information. As mentioned previously, most business \nopportunities originate from the Indonesian border where their business counterparts are seen to have a considerable edge. \nThe Indonesians have advanced business skills (i.e., bargaining) and more evolved marketing strategies (i.e., offering \ncompetitive prices, variety, customer service) that the west coast villages still have to develop. External assistance is needed \nto bridge the skills gap to facilitate equal trading relationships. \n \n2.  Key Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access to and \nuse of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in decision-making process: \n    Gender plan          Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nGiven women\u2019s low social status and vulnerability to violence and HIV/AIDS, the Project will \n(i)  provide training programs to women to develop their entrepreneurship and business skills; \n(ii)  provide financial assistance to pregnant women for regular medical check-ups and reduce infant and maternal \ndeaths; \n(iii)  transfer cash to the female head or a female adult of a household upon completion of the relevant intervention \nactivities; \n(iv)  involve local women\u2019s groups in the verification process for MCCT; and  \n(v)  target young women for HIV/AIDS education.  \n \nThe economic, health, and social/gender impact of the Project will be monitored through the project performance monitoring \nsystem and consistently reflected in the progress reports. In addition, all data collected during the Project will be gender-\ndisaggregated. \nIII.
