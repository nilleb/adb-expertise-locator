This objective will be achieved through a\nseries  of  interventions  in  the  next  several  years.  The\nproposed  Project  will  be  the  first  in  the  series  of\ninterventions.  The  Project  will  also  address  India\u2019s\nimmediate need to reduce capacity shortage in the NH\nsystems.  The  Project  will  finance  upgrading  of  the\nexisting  two-lane  single  carriageway  to  a  four-lane\ndivided highway on the Tumkur-Haveri section of about\n259 kilometers (km) on part of National Highway 4 (NH4)\nin the state of Karnataka.\nClassification Thematic:  Economic growth\nPrivate sector development\nEnvironmental Assessment Category B\nAn initial environmental examination was undertaken and\nthe summary is attached as a core appendix.\nRationale India\u2019s highway sector has long suffered from lack of\nfunding,  weak  capability  to  implement  projects,  poor\npolicy  coordination,  and  resultant  delay  in  decision\nmaking.  Launching  a  national  highway  development\nprogram  (NHDP)  of  an  unprecedented  scale,  the\nGovernment  decided  to  address  these  long-standing\nproblems.  The  Government  has  taken  a  number  of\nactions  to  boost  the  source  of  funds  for  highway\ndevelopment and facilitate private sector participation in\nhighway  development  and  maintenance.  While  these\nactions  have  significantly  contributed  to  resolving  the\nproblems, major challenges still remain. These include\nintroducing  more  sophisticated  financial  instruments,\ndiversifying methods of involving the private sector, and\nenhancing  financial  and  managerial  autonomy  of  the\nNational  Highways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI)  with  the\neventual  goal  of  corporatization.  These  challenges\ncannot be addressed by a one-time intervention. ADB\nenvisages taking a programmatic approach to address\nthese challenges from a longer term perspective.\nBeside these longer term challenges, the Government\nfaces  imminent  needs  to  alleviate  the  inadequate\ncapacity  of  the  NH  systems.  A  core  part  of  the\nGovernment  program  is  to  upgrade  the  golden", "iii\nquadrilateral  (GQ),  6,000  km  of  the  national  highway\nnetwork connecting four major metropolitan cities: Delhi,\nMumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata. The western transport\ncorridor (WTC) is the busiest part of the GQ, passing\nthrough  Delhi,  Haryana,  Rajasthan,  Gujarat,\nMaharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu states.\nGiven the higher traffic volume of the WTC over other\nparts of the GQ, it was decided to apply the concept of\npublic-private  partnership  (PPP)  along  this  corridor.  A\ndevelopment strategy based on the PPP concept was\ndeveloped in 2000 under ADB technical assistance (TA).\nThe strategy identified two sections as pilot projects: (i)\nJaipur  bypass  project  using  PPP  funding,  and  (ii)\nTumkur-Haveri  project  using  public  sector  financing.\nNHAI decided to develop the Jaipur bypass project with\nthe creation of a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) for the\neventual  participation  of  the  private  sector  in\ndevelopment, and operation and maintenance (O&M).\nFor the publicly funded portion, ADB proposes to extend\nfinancial  assistance  to  upgrade  the  Tumkur-Haveri\nsection of NH4. This Project was designed to incorporate\na number of road safety features such as median strips,\nservice  roads,  bypass,  underpasses,  overpasses,  and\nfencing.  These  design  features  are  unprecedented\nelsewhere on the GQ to date and will act as a model for\nsafety awareness in designing similar highways in India\u2019s\nhighway sector.\nObjectives and Scope The overall objective of the Project is to advance policy\nreforms in India to create an enabling environment for\nthe  efficient  and  sustainable  development  of  the  NH\nsystem with substantial participation of the private sector.\nThe policy framework developed and agreed upon with\nthe  Government  will  serve  as  a  road  map  for  future\nlending to India\u2019s highway sector.\nThe proposed Project is designed to achieve four specific\nobjectives: (i) remove capacity constraints on a critical\nsection  of  the  WTC;  (ii)  enhance  road  safety  by\nintroducing  design  features  that  will  reduce  traffic\naccidents  and  minimize  negative  impacts  of  road\nconstruction on people in the Project\u2019s zone of influence;\n(iii) enhance the corporate finance capability of NHAI;\nand  (iv)  increase  private  sector  participation  in  the\ndevelopment, and O&M of the NH system.\nTo  realize  these  objectives,  the  proposed  Project  will\nconsist  of  investment,  capacity-building,  and  project\nimplementation  support  components.  Investment\ncomponents include those for (i) upgrading the Tumkur-", "iv\nHaveri section of 259 km, and (ii) enhancing road safety\nby  incorporating  specific  design  features.  Capacity-\nbuilding  components  include  those  for  (i)  enhancing\ncorporate finance capability with an aim to facilitate the\neventual transition of NHAI into an efficiently managed\nautonomous  entity  such  as  a  corporation;  (ii)\ncommercializing  O&M  by  offering  these  functions  on\nconcession basis to the private sector; (iii) carrying out\nsafety audit to learn from experience during construction\nand improvement; and (iv) establishing a more rationally\nstructured toll system and increasing public acceptance\nof tolls through effective public campaign. The project\nimplementation support components include (i) providing\nconstruction  supervision  services,  and  (ii)  providing\nenvironmental  management  training  to  staff  of  NHAI,\ncontractors, and supervision consultants.\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project is estimated at $378 million\nequivalent. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at\n$240 million (64 percent of the total project cost), and the\nlocal  currency  cost  at  $138  million  equivalent  (36\npercent).\nFinancing Plan It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $240 million,\ncovering the entire foreign exchange cost of the Project,\nwhile  the  Government  will  provide  $138  million\nequivalent to cover the entire local currency cost.\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nPercent\nSource Exchange Currency Cost\nAsian Development  Bank 240 0 240 64\nGovernment 0 138 138 36\n         Total 240 138 378 100\nLoan Amount and Terms A  loan  of  $240  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital\nresources will be provided under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based\nlending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,\nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate\ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based\nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per\nannum,  a  front-end  fee  of  1.0  percent,  conversion\noptions that may be exercised in accordance with the\nterms of the draft Loan Agreement, the Loan Regulations\nand ADB\u2019s Conversion Guidelines, and such other terms\nand conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The\nGovernment will make available the loan proceeds to\nNHAI for the purposes of the Project. The current policy\nof the Government\u2019s assistance to NHAI is 80 percent in\ngrant and 20 percent as a loan. The Government will\nbear the foreign exchange risk on the loan.", "v\nPeriod of Utilization Until 31 December 2005\nExecuting Agency National Highways Authority of India (NHAI)\nImplementation\nArrangements The  Project  will  be  implemented  by  a  project\nimplementation unit to be established within NHAI.\nProcurement The civil works contract packages will be procured in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement,\nfollowing international competitive bidding procedures.\nConsulting Services International  and  domestic  consultants  will  provide\nconstruction supervision and environmental management\ntraining. They will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other\narrangements acceptable to ADB for engaging domestic\nconsultants.\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date 30 June 2005\nProject Benefits\nand Beneficiaries The main quantifiable benefit accruing from the Project\nconsists of savings in vehicle operating costs, which will\nreduce  transport  costs.  The  economic  internal  rate  of\nreturn of the Project is estimated at 38 percent. Direct\nproject  beneficiaries  are  road  users  and  transport\noperators.  Since  the  transport  industry  in  India  is\ncompetitive  and  is  likely  to  pass  on  the  benefits  of\ntransport cost savings to end users, the general public\nwill be another beneficiary of the Project.\nThe  improved  transport  system  will  bring  significant\neconomic  and  social  benefits  to  local  communities.\nBetter  transport  systems  will  increase  employment\nopportunities  along  the  highway.  The  enhanced  road\nsafety  features  of  the  Project  will  significantly  reduce\nroad  traffic  accidents.  Since  the  major  victims  of\naccidents  are  pedestrians  and  livestock,  the  rural\npopulation  living  along  the  project  highway  will\nsignificantly benefit from the upgraded highway.\nThe Project will also bring significant benefits to the rural\npoor.  While  the  proportion  of  Karnataka  State\u2019s\npopulation below the poverty line is above the national\naverage, the state has suffered from the existence of\nintrastate discrepancy in the poverty ratio. An improved\nroad network will reduce this intrastate discrepancy by (i)\nenabling villagers to shift from subsistence farming to\ncommercially  oriented  agricultural  surplus  production,", "vi\nand  (ii)  facilitating  the  rural  population\u2019s  movement  to\nbetter paid occupations such as those in manufacturing\nor  trading.  The  project  areas  are  characterized  by  a\nhigher  presence  of  scheduled  castes  and  scheduled\ntribes,  the  most  disadvantaged  groups  of  people  in\nIndian  society.  Construction  works  and  tree  planting,\ntogether  with  ensuing  maintenance  works,  will  be\nimmediate  income-earning  opportunities  to  groups  of\npeople who do not have stable wage earning jobs and\ndepend largely on occasional employment.\nTechnical Assistance In  conjunction  with  the  Project,  a  TA  is  proposed  to\nimplement  the  capacity-building  component  for\ncorporate finance enhancement of NHAI.  The total cost\nof the TA is estimated at $900,000, of which ADB will\nfinance $700,000 from the ADB-funded TA Program. The\nTA  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other\narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic\nconsultants.

I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to India for the Western Transport Corridor Project. The Report also describes proposed\ntechnical assistance for enhancing the corporate finance capability of the National Highways\nAuthority of India (NHAI), and if the proposed loan is approved by the Board, I, acting under the\nauthority delegated to me by the Board, shall approve the technical assistance.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. A  large  portion  of  the  national  highway  (NH)  network  in  India  urgently  needs\nimprovement. Large traffic volumes on the mainly two-lane NH network inflict heavy social and\neconomic costs, adversely affecting all levels of society and all sectors of the national economy.\nDuring  the  1998  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  requested  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to consider financing a series of projects along the western transport\ncorridor (WTC) connecting the three major metropolitan cities of Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai.\nThe first of these projects, the Surat-Manor Tollway Project, was approved by the Board in July\n2000.\n3. During  the  ADB  Country  Consultation  Mission  in  August  2000,  the  Government\nrequested that project processing for a second project commence at the earliest possible time\nwith use of detailed project reports prepared by NHAI\u2019s consultants. In response to this request,\na  Reconnaissance  Mission,  Fact-Finding  Mission,  and  Appraisal  Mission1  were  fielded  in\nSeptember 2000, November 2000, and February 2001, respectively. This report is based on the\nfindings of these missions. The overall project framework is in Appendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n4. India has an extensive and diversified transport system comprising about 3.3 million\nkilometers  (km)  of  roads,  62,809  km  of  rail,  12  major  and  139  minor  ports,  four  major\ninternational airports, 86 domestic airports, and about 14,500 km of navigable inland waterways.\nThe modal mix between road and rail transport has been continuously shifting from rail to road\nbecause of changing demands for transport services. Consequently, road transport is now the\ndominant mode of transport, accounting for 60 percent of freight movement and 80 percent of\npassenger traffic, with rail transport accounting for much of the remainder. A profile of transport\nin India is given in Supplementary Appendix A.\n1.  Transport Planning and Coordination\n5. Transport planning, coordination, and policy setting at the Central Government level are\nhandled by several line ministries, with overall coordination by the Planning Commission. A\nprevious key ministry, Ministry of Surface Transport (MOST), was reorganized in November\n2000 into two ministries: Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH) and Ministry of\nShipping and Ports (MOSP). MORTH\u2019s duties relate to the development and maintenance of\nnational highways, and policies on road transport. In addition, it coordinates state roads and\nissues guidelines on highway planning, design, and construction. MOSP is responsible for major\nports, inland water transport, and shipping. All railway planning and operations are under the\n                                                          \n1 The project processing team comprised S. Tsukada, Senior Transport Specialist/Mission Leader, IWTC; T. Kandiah,\nSenior Investment/Programs Officer, INRM; P. Vallely, Transport Specialist, IWTC; V. S. Rekha, Counsel, OGC; R.\nJayewardene, Resettlement Specialist, SOCD; Yue-Lang Feng, Environmental Specialist, ENVD; S. Tukuafu,\nFinancial Management Specialist, IWOD; and J. Arnold, Consultant.", "2\nMinistry of Railways. The Ministry of Rural Development is responsible for policy development,\nmonitoring, and coordination of rural roads. Airports and civil aviation are the responsibility of\nthe Ministry of Civil Aviation and Tourism.\n6. The  responsibility  for  developing  and  maintaining  NH\u2019s  rests  with  the  central\nGovernment, while state and district roads are the responsibility of the state governments\nconcerned. Because it is desirable to separate the planning and operational functions of the\ngovernment,  the  Government  established  NHAI  in  1988  as  its  operational  arm  for  NH\ndevelopment  and  maintenance.  NHAI  has  taken  over  a  designated  part  of  MORTH\u2019s\nresponsibility for developing and maintaining the NH system. NHAI\u2019s responsibilities include the\ngolden quadrilateral, north-south and east-west corridors, and several links to major ports and\nindustrial centers. NHAI covers one fourth of the national highway network length, and MORTH\nis responsible for the remaining part.\n2. Road Network and Traffic\n7. The road network in India is divided into three categories: (i) NHs, (ii) state highways,\nand (iii) district roads and rural roads (Appendix 2). The national and state highways facilitate\nmobility in the country\u2019s transportation system. The district and rural roads provide the much\nneeded means to meet social needs and to transport agricultural produce to markets. The road\nnetwork in India grew by 7.5 times from 400,000 km in 1951 to 3.3 million km in 2000 (including\n200,000 km of urban roads). Road density is now 1.0 km per square km, which compares\nfavorably with that in other developing countries. But despite the length of the road network, its\nquality and capacity are grossly inadequate for present and future demand for freight transport\nand passenger traffic.\n8. The NH network of 57,700 km carries about 40 percent of total road traffic.  However, 39\npercent of this national highway network is still of single-lane standard, 59 percent is two lanes,\nand the four-lane highways, account for only 2 percent.\n9. Over the last 10 years from fiscal year (FY) 1990/91 to 1999/2000, annual passenger\ntransport by road grew at the rate of 7.8 percent and freight transport by 7.6 percent, which is\nslightly higher than the growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) (7.5 percent) for the\nsame period. By 2001, passenger traffic is expected to reach about 3,000 billion passenger-km\nand freight traffic, 800 billion ton-km.\n3. Vehicle Fleet and Road Transport Industries\n10. The vehicle population grew from 300,000 in 1950/51 to an estimated 50 million in\n1999/2000. Buses and trucks accounted for 1 percent and 5 percent, respectively, cars and\njeeps  for  12  percent,  and  motorcycles  and  scooters  (two-wheelers)  for  68  percent;  the\nremaining  vehicles  were  mostly  autorickshaws  (three-wheelers)  and  agricultural  tractors.\nNationally, the number of automobiles has been growing at approximately 5 percent a year,\nwhereas heavy commercial vehicles have registered a growth rate of 6 percent over the last 10\nyears.\n11. India\u2019s automobile manufacturing industry has been regulated since independence. In\n1947, the Government declared that only indigenous firms operating according to an approved\nplan could manufacture motor vehicles. This led to the establishment of a vehicle manufacturing\nindustry basically using domestic capital with little use of foreign technologies. Deregulation\nstarted with the two-wheeler segment in mid-1980s. It was followed by opening up of passenger\ncar and commercial vehicle segments in 1990s to encourage the production of more fuel-\nefficient, safer, and better quality vehicles at reasonable prices. In 1996/97, 3.1 million motor", "3\nvehicles were manufactured in India, an increase of 114 percent over the 1992/93 level, due to\nthe unprecedented increase in manufacturing two- and three-wheeler vehicles \u2013 from 1.1 million\nto 2.6 million during the same period.\n12. The private sector almost wholly provides road freight operations. The national freight\nfleet increased from 963,000 in 1985/86 to 2,600,000 in 1999/2000. Light commercial vehicles\nincreased  much  faster  than  the  heavy  commercial  vehicles.  The  industry  has  a  multilevel\nstructure. Shippers usually contact transport companies that have financial capability to assume\nlegal liabilities associated with cargo haulage. Since these transport companies have limited\ntrucking fleet, most trucking services are provided with the use of trucks to be arranged by cargo\nbrokers. When transport companies receive order from shippers, they contact cargo brokers\nbased in the regions where the cargo originates. These brokers (usually individuals) will then\ncontact truck owners (who are again often individuals) or truck drivers, who often wait for\ncargoes at truck parking lots or along highways. Truck parking lots are usually found at the\noutskirts of cities, most of them had informally emerged and often are surrounded by small\nbuildings where cargo brokers are located. The performance of the trucking industry is poor\nbecause of (i) the high proportion of overage vehicles; (ii) lack of backhaul cargoes; and (iii) lack\nof loading/unloading facilities, which does not allow transshipment from larger to smaller trucks,\noften needed at the peripheries of major cities where truck bans are in force.\n13. The public and private sectors provide passenger services through road transport. Over\nthe years, the share of the public sector in the total fleet of buses has declined. While in 1980/81\nthe public sector held 45 percent of the total number of buses in the country, in 1995/96 its\nshare came down to 25 percent.\n4. Revenues/Expenditures and Road Fund\n14. The Central Government provides funds for developing and maintaining NHs from a\nyearly budgetary allocation, while the respective state governments provide funds for state\nhighways, and district and rural roads. Transport investments have accounted for about 13\npercent of total public sector spending under the Government\u2019s Seventh (FY1985-FY1990) and\nEighth (FY1992-FY1997) Five-Year Plan (FYP) periods. Expenditure on roads increased 250\npercent from Rs63,350 million under the Seventh FYP to Rs160,930 million under the Eighth\nFYP, although the road sector\u2019s share of total transport investment remained at about 22\npercent  under  both  periods.  Under  the  Ninth  FYP  (FY1997-FY2002),  the  transport  budget\nallocation increased by about three times from the Eighth FYP to Rs2,000,000 million, of which\nRs400,000 million (20 percent) is to be spent on roads.\n15. A central road fund in India has existed for years. Since its source of funds had been\nvery limited, the Central Government decided to revamp this fund into the Dedicated Road Fund\n(DRF). The major source of this fund is additional excise duties (called \u201ccess\u201d) of Re1 per liter of\npetrol or diesel. The former was introduced in 1998 and the latter in 1999 through the Central\nRoad Fund Ordinance. These new sources of funds are expected to bring Rs60 billion per\nannum  (equivalent  to  $1.3  billion)  of  funding  to  the  road  sector.  To  institutionalize  DRF,\nParliament  passed  the  Central  Road  Fund  Act  2000  in  November  2000.  According  to  its\nallocation formula and assuming Rs10 billion is raised from petrol and Rs50 billion from diesel,\napproximately Rs25 billion will be allocated for rural roads, Rs20 billion for NHs, Rs10 billion for\nstate highways, and Rs5 billion for railway crossings and other purposes. Unlike a typical road\nfund, which is primarily used for maintenance, DRF will be used mainly for developing the road\nnetwork (Supplementary Appendix B).", "4\n5.  Maintenance\n16. Over the years, NH network maintenance has not received adequate attention because\nof inadequate fund allocation. In the Ninth FYP, the budget allocation for NH maintenance was\nmore than doubled compared to that in the previous plan period. Notwithstanding this, the\nmaintenance shortfall, which was up to 48.3 percent in 1993/94, was only reduced to about 43.7\npercent in FY2000.\n17. NHAI, which is required to maintain NHs entrusted to it, currently does so through the\nPublic Works Departments (PWDs) or contracts it out to a private contractor (occasionally NHAI\ndoes it by itself). The maintenance cost has been covered by budgetary support from the\nCentral Government. Faced with rapid expansion in the road network entrusted to it, NHAI has\ndecided to explore the possibility of introducing an asset management concept to maintain and\nmanage its road network more systematically. It commissioned a study under World Bank\nfunding on the corridor management units (CMUs). A key element of the CMU concept is to\noperate and maintain the road network through a series of concessions to private contractors.\nA CMU is also responsible for ensuring the integrity of the right-of-way by maintaining fences\nand  markers,  taking  necessary  accident  prevention  measures  including  safety  signal  and\nequipment,  removing  obstacles  on  roads,  controlling  emission,  and  keeping  noises  within\nacceptable limits. If necessary, NHAI is given authority to introduce traffic management.  With\nthe recent completion of the study, two pilot CMUs will be established under the Third National\nHighway Project of the World Bank.\n6.  Road Safety\n18. The number and severity of road accidents in the country have been increasing. The\n1995 fatality rate (24 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles)2 was double that in 1982. Road fatalities in\n1999 reached 80,000 for the country, with NHs accounting for 34 percent of the total. Road\nsafety is a serious concern in India along all NHs. The sharp increase in the volume of traffic\nand overloaded trucks has aggravated the problem. Overcrowded buses pose another safety\nproblem. In New Delhi, public transport is not well regulated; buses account for 2 percent of the\ntraffic volume but are involved in 25 percent of the accidents. Law enforcement is very poor and\nresponsibility is divided among many district-level police wings. There is no highway patrol.\nEducation for drivers and other road users is not effective. Drivers of trucks and tractors lack\nproper  training  in  traffic  rules.  In  many  road  sections,  unauthorized  counterflow  traffic  is\nobserved along the fast moving lane, often resulting in fatal accidents. Traffic signs and lane\nmarkings are inadequate.\n19. Under ADB technical assistance (TA)3 on road safety, a system for identifying black\nspots on NHs was devised, and an accident investigation and prevention manual for highway\nengineers was prepared. Following this, the Road Safety Cell was established in MORTH to\ncollect, analyze, and interpret road accident statistics. This initiative is being continued through\nan ongoing World Bank-administered TA that will (i) produce a comprehensive road safety\nmanual covering the planning, design, construction, and maintenance aspects; (ii) review the\nIndian Road Congress norms on road safety and recommend improvements; and (iii) draw up\nsafety  guidelines  for  traffic  operations  during  road  construction.  The  Government  is  also\naddressing road safety issues through public information campaigns and road safety education\nprograms conducted by the road safety councils in the respective states.  For the first time, the\nGovernment\u2019s Ninth FYP has a dedicated budget provision for road safety, including specific\n                                                          \n2 Fatality rates for Japan, United States, and Western Europe range between 2 and 6. Among ADB\u2019s developing\nmember countries, the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019s fatality rate is 49; Malaysia, 7; Pakistan, 33; and Sri Lanka 20.\n3 TA 2001-IND: Road Safety, for $210,000, approved on 29 November 1993.", "5\nallocations  for  engineering  improvements,  traffic  control,  wayside  amenities,  and  highway\npatrolling schemes. In 1995, ADB also initiated a regional TA (RETA) on road safety,4 covering\nseveral developing member countries including India. The RETA assessed regional initiatives in\nroad safety and recognized that significant institutional progress had been made in India with\nthe  inclusion  of  road  safety  as  a  priority  area  for  activity  within  the  New  Delhi  regional\ninfrastructure.\n7. Environmental Issues\n20. Since 1991, the Government has gradually intensified its control over gas emission from\nvehicles.  First-stage control was introduced for petrol-powered vehicles in 1991 and for diesel-\npowered  vehicles  in  1992.  The  Government  plans  to  introduce  tougher  standards,\ncorresponding to Euro I requirements for passenger cars and commercial vehicles. Leaded fuel\nhas been gradually phased out from metropolitan cities since 1998 with the introduction of\nunleaded fuel. From December 1998, commercial vehicles over 15 years of age have been\nbanned from Delhi\u2019s center.\n21. ADB has been working with the Government to address environmental issues relating to\nthe  road  sector  such  as  preventing  of  environmental  degradation  during  construction  and\noperation  of  highways,  and  controlling  pollution  due  to  urban  traffic.  An  ADB  TA5  on\nenvironmental management prepared guidelines for highway projects; they are now used on all\nhighway improvement and reconstruction projects in India. The guidelines ensure that ADB\u2019s\nenvironmental standards are complied with. Under ADB\u2019s Second Road Project,6 a study of\nmeasures to control traffic pollution in urban areas was carried out. Consequently, the Central\nPollution Control Board updated its regulations for mass emissions and enforced them more\nstringently.\nB.  Government Sector Objectives and Plans\n22. Faced with chronic capacity shortage on major arterial links, the Government decided to\nundertake  a  radical  program  of  upgrading  key  NH  corridors  called  the  National  Highways\nDevelopment  Program  (NHDP).  A  key  component  of  NHDP  is  upgrading  the  golden\nquadrilateral, approximately 6,000 km of highway network connecting four major metropolitan\nareas (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Kolkata) and slated to be completed by the end of 2003.\nAnother component is upgrading the north-south and east-west corridors, 4,000 km and 3,300\nkm, respectively, to be completed by the end of 2007.7 NHDP calls for all of these corridors to\nbe upgraded to a minimum four-lane standard. Once NHDP is implemented, the focus will shift\nto improving access to major ports, the Port Connectivity Project, then to construction of a\nnational  expressway  network  and  rehabilitation  of  parts  of  the  NH  network  that  were  not\nincluded in NHDP.\n23. Construction costs for NHDP were estimated as approximately $13 billion. To finance\nthe program, NHAI intends to raise $4.4 billion through a levy on petrol and diesel (para. 15),\n$2.7 billion through financial markets, $1.4 billion through private sector participation in the\nproject, and the remaining $4.4 billion through external assistance. The Government\u2019s strategies\ninclude the revamping the road fund for development, issuing domestic bonds to tap the funds\nfrom India\u2019s capital markets, engaging the private sector in developing the road network, and\nusing international and bilateral assistance.\n                                                          \n4 TA 5620-REG: Regional Initiatives in Road Safety, for $600,000, approved on 4 January 1995.\n5 TA 2002-IND: Environmental Management of Road Projects, for $240,000, approved on 29 November 1993.\n6 Loan 1041-IND: Second Road Project, for $250 million, approved on 30 October 1990.\n7  The original target of 2009 was recently revised to 2007.", "6\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n24. Since 1988, ADB has extended four loans totaling $873 million and 22 TAs amounting to\n$8.9 million to the road sector in India. Apart from ADB, the World Bank and the Japan Bank for\nInternational Cooperation (JBIC) are also involved in the road sector. The World Bank has\nfinanced nine projects amounting to about $1,900 million to construct and rehabilitate rural\nroads, improve state highways, and widen NHs to four lanes. JBIC has provided five loans\namounting to $263 million equivalent to upgrade sections of NH2 and NH5 to four lanes and to\nconstruct a bridge across the Yamuna River at Allahabad-Naini. The World Bank has a pipeline\nof projects at various stages of processing. The projects include further loans for the Delhi-\nKolkata corridor as well as loans for state highways in a number of states. The World Bank\nintends to process three loans to the transport sector each year. ADB\u2019s assistance to the road\nsector  is  well  coordinated  with  the  World  Bank  and  JBIC  through  regular  consultation\n(Supplementary Appendix C).\nD.  Lessons Learned\n25. ADB\u2019s first loan project8 to improve highways in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Haryana,\nKarnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh was completed in March 1998, while the second\nloan  project  (footnote  6)  to  improve  national  and  state  highways  in  the  states  of  Andhra\nPradesh,  Karnataka,  Kerala,  Orissa,  Rajasthan,  Uttar  Pradesh,  and  West  Bengal  was\ncompleted in December 1999. Both projects, which were implemented by the respective state\nPWDs,  experienced  long  delays.  Project  completion  reports  (PCRs)9  for  the  two  projects\nidentified two major reasons: delay in establishing a project implementation unit (PIU) and\nrecruiting construction supervision consultants; and delay in preconstruction activities, such as\nland acquisition and clearance of utilities and trees due to difficulties in obtaining necessary\nadministrative clearances from relevant authorities. The PCRs recommended taking necessary\nactions to redress these problems. To further expedite the implementation, the PCRs further\nrecommended to (i) reduce the number of contract packages, thus increasing the size of each\ncontract; (ii) strengthen the contract management capability of executing agencies (EAs);  (iii)\nensure  acceptance  by  EAs  of  the  role  of  the  supervision  consultant  as  the  \u201cEngineer\u201d  in\naccordance with Federation Internationale des Ingenieurs-Conseils (FIDIC) conditions; and (iv)\nuse imprest account, and accord EAs direct access to the imprest account.\n26. ADB\u2019s third project to improve NHs in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana,\nRajasthan, and West Bengal was designed to overcome the problems experienced by the state\nPWDs in the earlier projects by making a specially created project unit within MORTH with\nresponsibility  for  project  implementation.  Project  implementation  responsibility  was  to  be\ntransferred at a later date, to NHAI once it became fully functional. The number of civil works\ncontract  packages  was  reduced  to  five  and  made  sufficiently  large  to  attract  the  more\nexperienced and better capitalized contractors. Despite these measures, the third project also\nexperienced start-up delays. For lack of Government budgetary allocation, NHAI became fully\nfunctional only in March 1995. In addition, the award of civil works contracts was delayed\nbecause  of  litigation  by  some  unsuccessful  bidders.  When  the  contracts  were  eventually\nawarded, while the entire project sites were not fully cleared of utilities and trees, NHAI ensured\nthat sufficient work force was available to the contractors to commence work. Setting aside the\nstart-up delays, NHAI implemented the third project well, with disbursements reaching as high\nas  $66  million  in  2000,  an  achievement  unique  for  a  road  project.  Most  of  the  problems\nassociated with the PWDs\u2019 projects (e.g., nonavailability and/or diversion of funds, delays in\n                                                          \n8 Loan 918-IND: Road Improvement Project, for $198 million, approved on 10 November 1988.\n9  Report numbers IN.198-99 (Aug.1999) for Loan 918-IND, and IN.266-00 (Nov. 2000) for Loan 1041-IND.", "7\npayments, delays in decision making due to bureaucratic process, lack of coordination among\nvarious agencies) were overcome by entrusting project implementation to NHAI.\n27. For  the  Surat-Manor  Tollway  Project,10  which  became  effective  in  November  2000,\ncontracts  have  been  awarded  for  both  civil  works  packages  and  consulting  services  for\nconstruction  supervision.  However,  contract  prices  for  civil  works  have  turned  out  to  be\nsubstantially lower than the estimates. While this is partly due to the strong competition among\nbidders, the overestimation of the project costs appears to be another reason for the difference\nbetween the estimated and contractual prices. The costs of civil works were estimated on the\nbasis of the Government\u2019s standard unit prices for construction.\n28. In the proposed Project, careful attention has been paid to overcome the shortcomings\nof previous ADB projects through the following implementation arrangements: (i) start-up delays\nwill be reduced by approving advance action for procuring civil works contracts and recruiting\nsupervision  consultants;  (ii)  the  land  acquisition  process  was  simplified  and  necessary\nadministrative authorities were delegated to designated \u201ccompetent authority\u201d; (iii) the clearance\nof  trees  and  utilities  from  the  right-of-way  will  be  a  condition  for  contract  award;  (iv)  the\nprequalification criteria were tightened and the contract package size made large enough to\nattract contractors with international experience; (v) NHAI agreed to accept the role of the\nsupervision consultants as Engineer in accordance with international best practice in contract\nmanagement; and (vi) the cost estimates were based on recent bid prices offered by contractors\nin several NHs projects, instead of on Government\u2019s unit prices. In addition, ADB is providing\nadvisory TA for strengthening NHAI\u2019s capability to manage contracts in accordance with FIDIC\nconditions.11\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n29. India is undertaking a huge program of highway upgrading (paras. 22 and 23) that will\ntake 10 years at a total cost of $13 billion. The Government has requested ADB to provide a\nseries of loans to cover part of the program. Given the potential scale of the lending, its\napproach  should  be  programmatic.  Projects  should  be  developed  in  a  sequential  and\nprogressive manner. A long-term strategy of ADB is to create an enabling environment for the\nefficient and sustainable development of the highway system so as to meet the needs of the\npublic for increased mobility and efficient cargo movement. Specific ways of intervening in the\nroad system will differ since each segment faces a different challenge.\n30. The road system of India can be grouped into four segments: key NH links, other NH\nsystem, state highways and road, and rural roads. A different agency oversees each segment of\nthe road sector: (i) NHAI, (ii) MORTH, (iii) state PWDs, and (iv) Ministry of Rural Development\n(MORD) (Table 1).\n                                                          \n10  Loan 1747-IND: Surat-Manor Tollway Project, for $180 million, approved on 27 July 2000.\n11 TA 3361-IND: Capacity Building for Contract Supervision and Management in the National Highways Authority of\nIndia, for $600,000, approved on 22 December 1999.", "8\nCoverage Traffic Carried\nSegment Agency\n(%) (%)\nKey national 0.5 25.0 NHAI\nHighways (NH)\nRest of the 1.5 15.0 MORTH\nNH system\nState highways 4.0 45.0 26 State PWDs\n& roads\nRural roads 94.0 15.0 MORD & PWDs\nTable 1: The Road System of India\n31. The medium- to long-term objectives of ADB\u2019s operations for each segment of the\nhighway system can be summarized as follows:\n1.  NHAI Segment\n(i)  Strengthen  institutional  capacity  for  project  implementation,  highway\noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  contract  management  while\nmaintaining the size of the organization small.\n(ii)  Further advance the public-private partnership concept.\n(iii)  Develop  more  sophisticated  financial  management  and  planning\ncapability  so  as  to  effectively  mobilize  necessary  funds  from  capital\nmarkets, both domestic and foreign.\n(iv)  Institute a stronger and transparent corporate governance.\n(v)  Transform NHAI into a more financially and managerially autonomous\nbody that should eventually evolve into a corporatized organization.\n2.  MORTH Segment\n(i)  Separate  planning  and  operational  functions,  and  redefine  the\nrelationship between MORTH and PWDs.\n(ii)  Secure transparent and equitable management of the road fund.\n(iii)  Strengthen financing capability, particularly for maintenance.\n(iv)  Reorient MORTH from an infrastructure developing to a policy planning\nministry so that it can address more effectively policy issues such as\nmodernized  trucking  services,  road  safety,  and  cargo  handling  for\nfacilitating transshipment from long-distance to pick-up trucks.", "9\n3.  State PWDs12 Segment\n(i)  Strengthen financing capability through a variety of mechanisms including\nstate-level road funds and public-private partnership approach.\n(ii)  Reengineer the current institutional arrangements for road development\nand  maintenance  by  redefining  the  role  of  PWDs,  separating  their\nplanning and operational functions, and establishing road development\ncorporations.\n4.  MORD Segment\n(i)  Streamline  interagency  relationship  (MORD,  PWDs,  and  district\ngovernments)  so  as  to  effectively  plan  and  implement  network\ndevelopment and maintenance.\n(ii)  Introduce a more objective methodology for selecting and prioritizing of\nrural road investments.\n(iii)  Institute a systematic method of maintenance with adequate budgetary\nsupport.\n32. Under  this  programmatic  approach,13  road  sector  operations  will  be  carried  out  as\ndescribed below. The approach is schematically presented in Figure 1.\n(i)  Develop an overall framework for providing assistance to India\u2019s road sector.\n(ii)  Develop medium-term road maps for the policy and institutional reforms for each\nsegment of the road sectors (key NHs, other NH systems, state highways/roads),\nand develop specific milestones that will trigger the next loan.\n(iii)  Under these road maps, ADB extends a series of loans to the various segments\nof the road subsector.\n(iv)  Policy dialogues will be conducted regularly to review the progress of policy and\ninstitutional reforms and assess the need for midcourse corrections to the road\nmaps.\n(v)  Project processing will be much more straightforward, focusing on examining\nwhether the milestones are implemented. Once this issue is cleared, the project\nprocessing activities will focus on examining the technical, financial, economic,\nenvironmental, and social viability of the projects.\n                                                          \n12 Focal states will primarily be considered, but nonfocal states will not necessarily be excluded.\n13 The approach should be distinguished from a program loan lending modality, which is essentially based on the\npolicy reform. The above loans are essentially designed as investment projects that will be prepared just like typical\nhighway projects, but with the policy reform elements to be implemented in a systematic, sequential, and coherent\nmanner.", "10\nYear 2001 Year 2002 Year 2003 Year 2004\nOverall Framework for\nproposed medium-term\ninterventions\n1.

Since  1988,  ADB  has  been  engaged  in  policy  dialogue  with  the  Government  and\nproviding TA programs on critical policy and institutional issues. The dialogue and related TA\nactivities, together with coordinated efforts by the World Bank and other aid agencies, have led\nthe Government to take a series of bold policy actions aimed at establishing an enabling\nenvironment for the sustainable development of the NH system in India. The reform actions to\ndate can be grouped into four categories: (i) corporate governance, (ii) enhanced financing\ncapability, (iii) improved project implementation capability, and (iv) facilitation of private sector\nparticipation.  The major reform actions by the Government taken to date are listed below.\n(i)  Strengthened corporate governance\n(a)  Separating the planning and operating functions of the Government by\nestablishing  a  specialized  agency  in  charge  of  NH  development  and\nmanagement  (NHAI  was  established  in  1988,  became  operational  in\n1995).", "11\n(b)  Delegating  broader  decision-making  authority  to  NHAI  so  that  it  can\ndecide on individual investment and procurement without going through\nthe lengthy process of obtaining approval from the Public Investment\nBoard  (PIB).  This  delegation  of  authority  was  made  possible  by\nincreasing NHAI\u2019s board members to include the members of PIB such as\nsecretaries  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  MORTH,  and  Planning\nCommission [2000].\n(c)  Authorizing the NHAI chairman to recruit its staff, both management and\nprofessional,  without  going  through  the  usual  recruitment  process  of\ngovernment officers [1997].\n(ii)  Improved financing capability\n(a)  Revamping  existing  current  road  fund  by  introducing  an  excise  duty\n(called \u201ccess\u201d) levied on petrol and diesel, which is expected to generate\nRs60 billion ($1.3 billion) per annum for the road sector [1998 and 1999].\n(b)  Approving NHAI\u2019s issuance of bonds to raise funds from domestic capital\nmarkets. Issuance was facilitated by exempting purchasers of the bonds\nfrom the capital gains tax [2000].\n(c)  Adopting the policy that, once a road is upgraded to a four-lane highway,\nthe  NH  could  charge  toll,  paving  the  way  to  future  recovery  of  the\nconstruction cost of the NH system [1997].\n(iii) Enhanced project implementation capacity\n(a)  Simplifying the century-old land acquisition procedure by amending the\nNational  Highway  Act.  Under  this  process,  land  acquisition  will  be\nsignificantly expedited and can be completed within a predictable period\nof time.\n(b)  Strengthening NHAI\u2019s capacity for dealing with environmental and social\nissues. A general manager in charge of environmental issues has already\nbeen assigned. In addition, ADB is providing TA to NHAI to establish a\nseparate unit for resettlement and social development within NHAI.14\n(iv) Increased private sector participation\n(a)  Issuing  and  implementing  a  policy  statement,  \u201cGuideline  for  Private\nSector  Participation  in  the  Road  Infrastructure\u201d  [1997].  The  guideline\nincludes a number of critical policy actions to facilitate the build-operate-\ntransfer  (BOT)  scheme,  including  (i)  tax  exemption  accorded  to  BOT\ninvestors (100 percent income tax exemption for the first five years and\n30  percent  exemption  for  the  next  five  years);  (ii)  government\ncommitment in all preparative actions including land acquisition, right-of-\nway clearance, and utilities removal; (iii) NHAI\u2019s provision of a minimum\namount of capital grant, in case that is needed to get a adequate numbers\nof contractors to bid for a project; (iv) foreign direct investments with up to\n                                                          \n14 TA 3365-IND: Capacity Building for Social Development, for $800,000, approved on 23 December 1999.", "12\n100 percent equity participation; and (v) duty-free import of modern high-\nperformance construction equipment.\n(b)  Amending the National Highway Act, authorizing private sector investors\nto  operate  a  part  of  the  NH  system  and  collect  tolls  under  the\nGovernment\u2019s concession scheme [1997].\n34. As seen above, significant progress has been made on major policy and institutional\nfronts, but a number of areas remain to be addressed. They include (i) establishing a medium-\nto long-term goal for NHAI, (ii) instituting more efficient highway maintenance systems, (iii)\nenhancing of the financing capability of NHAI, (iv) enhancing road safety, and (v) modernizing\nroad freight services.\n(i)  Establishment of a clear medium- to long-term strategic framework for NHAI.\nNHAI is still in a transitional stage. Starting with a dozen staff and a capital of\nRs7 billion in 1995, it has grown into an organization with 350 staff handling more\nthan Rs60 billion per year. Its operations are expected to further expand and\nbecome  more  complicated  due  to  the  introduction  of  alternative  financing\nmechanisms and the increased participation of the private sector.  Despite these\nchanges,  its  basic  way  of  doing  business  is  still  essentially  based  on  the\ntraditional \u201cagency system\u201d that had primarily been developed decades ago for\nentrusting civil works of the Central Government to state PWDs. NHAI receives\nproject  management  fees  (3  percent  of  the  costs  of  the  externally  assisted\nprojects,  and  9  percent  for  other  projects)  in  return  for  its  execution  of  the\nentrusted civil works. Beside this, NHAI does not have its own source of revenue.\nIt  does  not  retain  the  tolls  it  collects,  which  are  to  be  deposited  to  the\nconsolidated  account  of  the  Central  Government  (highways  are  not  NHAI\u2019s\nassets). This arrangement not only gives little incentive to NHAI for cost-effective\nhighway construction, but also makes it difficult for NHAI to transform itself into a\nmore independent entity that could mobilize the funds from the capital markets in\na more sustainable and cost-effective manner. Entering into the new phase of\nevolution, NHAI should set out a medium- to long-term vision of its eventual goal.\nThe proposed Project has incorporated a component designed to facilitate policy\ndialogue with the Government on the most appropriate form of the organization,\nand how NHAI is to be transformed into that new form.\n(ii)  Instituting more efficient highway operation and maintenance systems. This is a\nrelatively new area to NHAI. With increased highway assets available for service,\nO&M are becoming an increasingly important area. Given the limited human\nresources  in  NHAI,  the  most  effective  way  of  carrying  out  this  function  is\ncontracting it out to the private sector. The previously approved Loan 1747-IND\n(footnote 10) has incorporated this concept. The proposed Project is to further\nadvance this approach by incorporating an asset management concept (i.e.,\nCMU) as detailed in para. 17.\n(iii)  Enhancing the financing capability of NHAI. Recently NHAI decided to involve the\nprivate sector in BOT schemes, but many of these will be viable only if a grant or\nannuity is offered to the private sector.15 NHAI has also raised funds from the\ncapital  markets  through  bond  issues  made  possible  only  by  exempting  the\npurchasers from the capital gains tax. This tax exemption status is less likely to\nbe repeated in subsequent bond issues. Given the envisaged scale of fund\n                                                          \n15 Bridge or bypass or short section developments were made without offering grants and annuities.", "13\nmobilization through capital markets and also from the private sector, NHAI has\nto further strengthen its financing capability and diversify its financing schemes.\nThe proposed Project will assist NHAI with diversified and sophisticated financing\ninstruments including securitization of future revenue flow.\n(iv)  Advancing public-private partnership (PPP). Given the multi-purpose nature of\nNH systems in India, which entail both public and private goods elements, they\nshould be developed through the participation of the public and private sectors.\nIn this PPP approach, the Government does not pay more than the public goods\ncomponent. The current arrangement that the Government adopted for the BOT\nhighway  projects  presents  an  effective  mechanism  since  bidders  for  a  BOT\nproject compete with each other for the amount of the grant (either positive or\nnegative), and the results of bidding will be a good indication of the optimum\nbalance of the public and private goods elements. It was, therefore, agreed to\nreview the experience of the BOT operations during the Project midterm review\ncurrently scheduled for May 2003.\n(v)  Enhancing road safety. India has one of the highest traffic accident rates in Asia\ndue  to  a  number  of  factors,  including  inadequate  enforcement  of  safety\nregulations, ineffective vehicle inspection system, and inadequate safety training.\nThe most serious factor is the mixture of fast-moving and slow-moving traffic and\nuncontrolled pedestrian crossing. The proposed Project will address this problem\nby establishing a continual median to prevent counterflow traffic, separating fast\nand  slow  traffic,  and  providing  underpasses  and  overpasses  to  enable\npedestrians to cross roads.\n.\n(vi)  Modernizing road freight services. The upgraded NH system is designed for an\noperating speed of 100 km per hour. However, trucks currently run at a speed of\n40-50 km, particularly when carrying heavy-duty cargoes such as containers.\nUnless  trucking  services  are  modernized,  the  full  benefits  of  the  upgraded\nhighway  network  will  not  be  realized.  A  policy  for  the  modernization  of  the\ntrucking  services,  particularly  those  for  intermodal  operation,  should  be\ndeveloped and implemented. ADB and MORTH agreed to address this issue in\nfuture ADB activities.\n35. These policy and institutional issues will be addressed in close cooperation with the\nWorld Bank as has been done in the last several years.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n36. India\u2019s  highway  sector  has  long  suffered  from  lack  of  funding,  weak  project\nimplementation capability, poor policy coordination, and delays in decision making. Launching\nan  unprecedented  scale  of  a  national  highway  development,  the  Government  decided  to\naddress these decade-old institutional problems and issues. The Government has already taken\nactions to boost the source of funds for highway development and facilitate private sector\nparticipation in highway development and maintenance to fill up some of the financing gap\nneeded for NHDP development. While these actions have significantly contributed to resolving\nthe  problems,  even  more  fundamental  challenges  remain.  They  include  introducing  more\nsophisticated  financial  instruments,  diversifying  methods  involving  the  private  sector,  and\nenhancing  the  financial  and  managerial  autonomy  of  NHAI  with  the  eventual  goal  of\ncorporatization.  These  challenges  cannot  be  met  by  a  one-time  intervention;  they  require", "14\nconsistent and repeated interventions. ADB envisages launching a new initiative to address\nthese issues from a longer term perspective by undertaking a sequential and progressive\napproach for future lending in this subsector.\n37. Aside  from  the  longer  term  challenges,  the  Government  is  facing  the  immediate\nchallenge of upgrading key arterial corridors, particularly the golden quadrilateral (GQ). The\nwestern transport corridor (WTC) is the busiest part of the GQ, passing through Delhi, Haryana,\nRajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu states. Constructing an efficient,\ncontinuous transport linkage throughout the WTC will have a significant impact on overall\neconomic growth and also allow benefits from recent economic growth to spread to the poorer\nareas. The Surat-Manor Tollway Project (footnote 10) was the first loan ADB has provided to\nassist the upgrading of GQ. The proposed Project is the second in the series of assistance for\nupgrading GQ.\n38. Given the higher traffic volume in the WTC than in other parts of the GQ, the WTC was\nchosen to experiment a concept of public-private partnership. A development strategy was\ndeveloped under ADB\u2019s Project Preparatory TA.16 The WTC development plan identified that\napproximately 24 percent of the sections of WTC were viable as projects using private sector\nfunding of some form. The remaining 76 percent not found viable for private sector funding need\npublic sector funding (Appendix 3). Two sections were identified as pilot projects: (i) Jaipur\nbypass project using PPP funds, and (ii) Tumkur-Haveri project using public sector financing.\nFor  the  Jaipur  bypass  project,  ADB  provided  TA  to  enable  NHAI  to  proceed  with  a  PPP\napproach,\n39. For the publicly funded portion, ADB proposes to extend financial assistance to upgrade\nthe Tumkur-Haveri section of NH4. This Project was designed to incorporate a number of road\nsafety features such as median separation, service roads, bypass, underpasses, overpasses,\nand fencing. These features are unprecedented elsewhere on the GQ to date and will act as a\nmodel for safety awareness in designs of similar highways in India\u2019s highway sector.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n40. The Project aims to advance policy reforms in India to create an enabling environment\nfor the sustainable development of NH systems with substantial participation of the private\nsector.  The  policy  framework  (Appendix  4),  together  with  a  time-bound  action  plan,  was\ndeveloped and agreed upon with the Government. It will serve as a road map for future lending\noperations to the NH subsector in India (para. 32).\n41. Under  this  overall  framework,  the  proposed  Project  was  designed  to  achieve  four\nspecific objectives: (i) remove capacity constraints on a critical section of the Project highway;\n(ii) enhance road safety by introducing design features that will reduce traffic accidents and\nminimize  negative  impacts  of  road  construction  for  people  within  the  Project  highway;  (iii)\nenhance corporate finance capability of NHAI to facilitate its eventual transition to an efficiently\nmanaged autonomous entity, including possible corporatization; and (iv) increase private sector\nparticipation in the development and O&M of the NH systems.\n                                                          \n16 TA 2986-IND: Western Transport Corridor \u2013 Facilitating Private Participation, for $1 million, approved on 9\nFebruary 1998.", "15\n42. To realize the specific objectives, the Project includes investment, capacity-building, and\nproject implementation support components. The investment components will\n(i)  upgrade the existing two-lane single-carriageway highway to a four-lane divided\nhighway in the Tumkur-Haveri section of about 259 km on NH4;17 and\n(ii)  enhance  road  safety  by  incorporating  several  design  features:  a  divided\ncarriageway designed to prevent head-on collisions, service roads to separate\nslow-moving  and  fast-moving  traffic,  enlarged  cross-culverts  to  facilitate  road\ncrossing  of  pedestrians  and  farm  traffic,  overbridges  for  the  same  purpose,\nbypasses to separate through traffic from locally originated and destined traffic, and\nfences  to  prevent  unlawful  crossing  and  minimize  noise  pollution  in  populated\nareas.\nThe capacity building components will\n(i)  enhance  the  corporate  finance  capability  of  NHAI  by  (a)  facilitating  capital\nmobilization by securitizing future revenue and issuing bonds; (b) enhancing the\ntreasury function so as to maximize the yield to be raised from the available funds;\n(c) improving the financial reporting system so that potential investors can make\nwell-informed  decisions;  and  (d)  facilitating  the  transition  of  NHAI  into  a  more\nefficiently managed autonomous body such as a corporatized organization, by\ncomparing the relative merits of existing and alternative forms of organizations and\ndeveloping  a strategy for transforming the NHAI;\n(ii)  commercialize O&M for the Project section of NH4 by offering the O&M functions\nas  concession  to  the  private  sector  together  with  consulting  services  for  (a)\ndeveloping  O&M  tender  documents  for  a  private  concessionaire,  specifically\ndesigned for the Tumkur-Haveri section in line with the corridor management unit\nconcept; and  (b) providing assistance in bid evaluation and negotiation with a\nsuccessful bidder;\n(iii)  conduct  safety  audit  to  learn  from  experience  during  construction  and\nimplementation; and\n(iv)  establish a more rationally structured tolling system and increase public acceptance\nof tolls through effective public campaigns.\nThe last three activities are being funded under the ongoing Surat-Manor Tollway\nProject (footnote 10) (see para. 68).\nThe project implementation support components will\n(i)  provide construction supervision services for the investment components; and\n(ii)  provide environmental impact management training to staff of NHAI, contractors,\nand supervision consultants.\n                                                          \n17 Project road is between Km 75 (Tumkur) and Km 340 (Haveri) with exclusion of a bypass to Sira Town between\nKm 116 and Km 122.", "16\n1. Investment Components\n43. Upgrading Highways.  The Project will rehabilitate the existing highway and widen the\nentire section to a four-lane divided highway. Of the total project length of 259 km, 18.3 km will\nbe a new four-lane divided highway to avoid congested urban areas and to minimize the impact\non property and buildings, 2.7 km will be a new four-lane divided highway to realign a short\nlength of highway with substandard geometry, and 5.5 km will be a two-lane single carriageway\nto relieve the existing Hariyur bypass. The design speed will be 100 km/hour, but a reduced\ndesign speed of 80 km/hr will be adopted for the Harihar and Chitradurga bypasses due to right-\nof-way constraints. Traffic loading for pavement design was derived from traffic projections\ngenerated during the economic analysis of the project together with field investigation work. In a\nsignificant departure from the usual Indian practice, the existing pavement will not be retained\nbut will be milled off and reused in the lower layers of new pavement construction. This change\nis justified after evidence from previous NHAI projects raised questions as to the integrity of\nstructural overlays on old pavements that have a complex history of widening and overlaying.\nPavement designs for both reconstructed and new pavements were based on a 15-year life.\n44. Enhancing Road Safety. The design of the upgrading works contains a number of\nelements that are novel in Indian highway construction. During the design stage, a significant\neffort was made to incorporate features that will (i) enhance safety for the user, and (ii) minimize\ndisruption to communities through which the highway passes. Examples of the safety features\nare the adoption of limited access, in which traffic can only join the highway at interchanges via\n21 grade separated interchanges at major junctions and 13 at-grade junctions for minor roads;\nfencing to control pedestrian access; and service roads to separate local traffic from high-speed,\nlong-distance traffic. Major highways can become an impenetrable barrier to local communities\nthrough which the highway passes. To mitigate the inconvenience to local people and allow\npassage of agricultural vehicles and animals, overpasses and underpasses will be provided at\n63 locations. The overpasses and underpasses will not be connected to the main highway and\nthus will allow safe passage of local traffic without introducing conflict with the high-speed, long-\ndistance traffic. Where minor local roads run up to the main highway, service roads will lead\nlocal traffic to one of the major interchanges or junctions. As individual features, none of the\npreceding are completely new to India, but the extent and number that have been incorporated\nin this Project are unprecedented.\n2. Capacity-Building Components\n45. Enhancing Corporate Finance Capability. To maximize the value of the revamped\nroad fund, the Government recently decided that it will use the fund not only for paying the\nconstruction costs but also for serving debts incurred or to be incurred by bond issues. This will\nenable NHAI to raise approximately six times more funds from markets with the use of the same\namount of the cess money, but this will also require NHAI to mobilize funds from capital markets\nin a more aggressive manner (i.e., larger scale and better term). To do that, NHAI must be\nequipped with more sophisticated financial management and planning capabilities, particularly\nthose for bond issues.\n46. NHAI has already started this process by issuing seven-year domestic bonds with a\nput/call option after three years. The first issue in 2000 raised Rs5 billion ($111 million). The\nsecond bonds were issued in February 2001 as an on-tap issue. Both issues carry a triple A\nrating by virtue of their implicit government guarantee. There are plans to raise approximately\nRs120 billion ($2.5 billion) through a series of bond issues, but this is likely to exceed the\nabsorptive capacity of the domestic bond markets and will crowd out other institutions from\nIndian bond markets. Unless NHAI mobilizes funds from foreign capital markets, the current\nfinancing strategy will not be sustainable. Although NHAI has not yet considered issuing bonds", "17\nin foreign capital markets, it has to take a serious look at this possibility. That undertaking will\nrequire NHAI to disclose more financial information to the public so that potential investors can\nmake better informed decisions.\n47. Although this direct borrowing will bring a significant amount of funds to NHAI, these will\nnot be sufficient to implement the huge tasks mandated by the Government. It will be necessary\nfor NHAI to develop alternative financial instruments. Beside the usual BOT schemes (which\nNHAI has already been pursuing), securitizing the future toll revenue is also to be explored.\nNHAI has already established several special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) for the construction of\nhighway links connecting to major traffic generators such as ports. It plans to sell its shares in\nthese companies once SPVs demonstrate their revenue-generating capability. Initial public offer\nof these stocks should be made under an overall strategic plan.\n48. These changes call for NHAI to be equipped with sophisticated financial instruments.\nThe current form of the organization (an operational arm of the Government specializing in\nhighway development and maintenance) will not necessarily be best for this purpose. NHAI\nshould begin to examine an alternative form of organization from a more strategic and longer\nterm perspective. Policy dialogue should be initiated with the aim of forming a consensus\namong key stakeholders on the future direction of NHAI.\n49. As a tool to carry out policy dialogue with the Government, TA is proposed to enhance\nthe corporate finance capability of NHAI. The proposed TA will be carried out in two stages.\n50. The first stage activities are designed to meet NHAI\u2019s immediate need to strengthen its\ncapacity in the area of finance. More specifically, they will consist of support for (i) capital\nmobilization, (ii) the treasury function, and (iii) a financial reporting system.\n(i)  Support for capital mobilization will enable NHAI to develop a general strategy for\nfinancing road investments and evaluating alternative financial instruments both\ncurrently available and realizable in the medium term. The financial instruments\nthat NHAI currently considers are special-purpose vehicles (SPV), bond financing,\nand other forms of securitization. The relative costs for these instruments will be\ndetermined  and  the  potential  size  of  the  market  for  them  estimated.  Also  the\navailable mechanisms for credit enhancement will be explored including different\nforms of third-party guarantees. Criteria and analytical procedures for matching\nroad  projects  and  financing  options  will  be  developed  considering  explicit\nobjectives.  Specific  implementation  plans  will  be  developed  for  each  specific\nopportunity, together with the timetable for implementation.\n(ii)  Support for the treasury function aims to strengthen that function. Current practices\nin collecting tolls, revenues, and payments for construction, service contracts, and\ndebt  service  will  be  reviewed  to  ensure  reliability  in  meeting  obligations.  This\ncomponent will also develop a strategy for funds placement to maximize yield while\nensuring adequate liquidity. Performance measures will be developed to monitor\nthe effectiveness of funds placement. A financial planning model will be developed\nin which alternative investment options will be evaluated along with the projected\ncash flows related to construction activities, debt service, Government grants, cess\nrevenues, and operating revenues and expenditures. The model will be used to\nevaluate allocation of funds in terms of liquidity and return.\n(iii)  Support for financial reporting will enable NHAI to restructure its financial and\naccounting reporting system to provide the information required to reinforce efforts\nto raise financing in the capital markets, both domestically and internationally.", "18\nAccounting policies and standards should evolve as the financing operations of\nNHAI  become  sophisticated.  Thus,  the  consultant  must  develop  a  series  of\nrecommendations to enable NHAI to shift from current accounting practices to\nthose consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting Practices of India (GAAP-I),\nand,  then,  to  international  accounting  standards  (IAS)  (para.  71  gives  a  more\ndetailed discussion of NHAI\u2019s accounting policies and practices). Transition from\nthe  traditional  accounting  system  to  those  more  commercially  oriented  ones\nrequires  extensive  capacity  building  exercises  for  NHAI  staff.  Consultants  will\nprovide the necessary training.\n51. The  above  activities  will  be  preceded  by  a  review  of  the  current  legal  framework\nassociated with ownership of NHs (including the difference between entrusted, vested, leased,\nor owned. The activities will be supplemented by training for NHAI\u2019s staff in financial modeling\nexercises, and regional study tours to countries such as the People\u2019s Republic of China that\nhave introduced different models of securitization and raising of funds from the capital markets.\n52. The second-stage activities will focus on policy dialogues on the broader and longer\nterm issues with the active participation of relevant Government ministries and the World Bank.\nA major topic will be the future form of the organization, with emphasis on how to transform\nNHAI into a financially and managerially autonomous body such as a corporatized organization.\nThe main activities follow:\n(i)  review the results/progress of the World Bank study on institutional development;\n(ii)  review the experiences of other countries with regard to forms of organizations\nthat provide infrastructure through the public sector operating arm;\n(iii)  select possible alternative forms of organization and apply the strategic financial\nplanning model to compare the existing and alternative forms in terms of financial\nperformance;\n(iv)  develop  a  strategy  for  transforming  NHAI  into  an  efficiently  managed  and\nfinancially/managerially autonomous body; and\n(v)  hold a series of workshops on the future form of NHAI, with the participation of\nrelevant agencies and the World Bank .\n53. The activities wIll be carried out in coordination with the World Bank, which is currently\nassisting NHAI in institutional strengthening within the existing framework of the organization.\nThe ADB proposal will be carried out under a TA to be processed in conjunction with the\nProject.\n54. Commercializing O&M. The commercialization concept was originally incorporated in\nthe Surat-Manor Project, which is expected to be completed in 2003. During processing of the\nWTC Project, it was decided to make this concept consistent with the corridor management unit\napproach,  which  was  developed  and  will  be  tested  under  the  World  Bank-financed  Third\nNational Highway Project. It was further decided to engage one consulting firm for both the\nSurat Manor Project and the WTC Project to ensure the consistency of concession agreements\nin both projects. An outline paper for O&M concession (Supplementary Appendix D) has been\nprepared for the consulting services that will develop O&M tender documents for a private\nsector concessionaire including a concession agreement, and assist in bid evaluation and\nnegotiation with a successful bidder.", "19\n55. Conducting Safety Audit.  At various stages of the Project, a safety audit will be carried\nout to learn from experiences during construction and implementation. Lessons learned will be\napplied to future construction and improvement along the WTC (Supplementary Appendix E).\n56. Toll System Study. As the national highway network expands, an increasing number of\ntollbooths will be established along the highways to be managed by NHAI. To date, however,\nthe locations of tollbooths have been determined in a rather adhoc manner. As a results,\nhighway users feel frustrated because of the lack of conceptually acceptable tolling systems.\nThe basic regime of the current tolls was set based on a willingness-to-pay survey, but the\ncurrent level of tolls does not necessarily reflect that basis. They are too low to generate the\nlevel of funds necessary for the continuous development of the national highway system. Thus,\na rationally structured toll system needs to be instituted. Alternative pricing strategies should\nalso be developed. The proposed study will address those issues. Another important element of\nthe tolling system is the perception of tolls by the public that is not yet used to the concept of\npaying for the use of highways. Public campaigns aimed at increased acceptance of tolls will be\na strategic action to take for successful tolling operations for the national highway system. A\npublic campaign strategy will be developed and implemented through this TA with use of\nexperts of extensive knowledge and experience in public campaigning. The summary terms of\nreference (TOR) is in Supplementary Appendix F.\n3.  Project Implementation Support Components\n57. Construction Supervision. To enhance the efficiency and quality of construction works,\ntwo consulting firms will be engaged to supervise the construction of the project road (the TOR\nis in Supplementary Appendix G). The consultants will undertake the role of engineer as set out\nin the FIDIC conditions of contract, as would normally be the case for a major internationally\nfunded project.\n58. Environmental Management Training. To strengthen the capacity for environmental\nmanagement, NHAI will receive funds for training in environmental management. Trainees will\nbe contractors, supervision consultants, and NHAI environment officers in charge of this Project\nand the Surat-Manor Project (Supplementary Appendix H).\nC. Cost Estimates\n59. The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $378.0  million  equivalent,  including\nallowances for contingencies and interest during construction. The foreign exchange cost is\nestimated at $240.0 million, representing 63.5 percent of the total cost, while the local currency\ncost is estimated at $138.0 million equivalent, representing 36.5 percent (Table 2 and Appendix\n5).", "20\nTable 2: Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local\nItem Currency Currency Total\nA.

The Government of India has requested a loan of $240.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary\ncapital resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a\ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based\nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0 percent\n(the front-end fee will be capitalized in the loan), conversions options that may be exercised in\naccordance with the terms of the draft Loan Agreement, the Loan Regulations, and ADB\u2019s\nConversion  Guidelines,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan\nAgreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for the Government\u2019s\ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and\nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were the Government\u2019s own independent\ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice of ADB. The remaining\nproject  cost  of  $138.0  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs  will  be  covered  by  the\nGovernment (Table 3). The proceeds of the loan will be made available by the Government to\nNHAI promptly as required for the purposes of the Project. The Government\u2019s current policy of\nassistance to NHAI in this regard is a loan-grant ration of 20:80. The Government will bear the\nforeign exchange risk of the loan.\nTable 3: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Currency Currency Cost Percentage\nAsian Development Bank 240.0 - 240.0 63.5\nGovernment - 138.0 138.0 36.5\nTotal 240.0 138.0 378.0 100.0", "21\nE. Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Management\n61. NHAI will be the Executing Agency for the Project. The Project will be implemented by a\nspecially created project implementation unit (PIU), which will be located in Chitradugra, a town\nbetween Tumkur and Haveri. A general manager level staff will be assigned as project director,\nassisted by five deputy general managers or managers, each responsible for one contract\npackage. The activities of the PIU will be overseen by the chairperson of NHAI who will be\nassisted by a chief general manager in charge of NH4 development. Sufficient administrative\nauthority  will  be  delegated  to  the  PIU  for  effective  and  timely  decision  making  on  project\nimplementation matters.  Appendix 6 gives the organization structure of PIU.\n62. Given the length of Project roads, NHAI decided to engage two consulting firms to\nensure  adequate  construction  supervision.  One  firm  will  look  after  three  contracts  located\nbetween Tumkur and Chirtradugra, and, the other firm two contracts between Chitradugra and\nHaveri. The two consulting firms will act as Engineers for the Project. It was agreed with NHAI to\nsignificantly  expand  the  power  of  the  \u201cEngineer\u201d  so  as  to  ensure  a  more  objective  and\ntransparent processing of contract variations.\n2.  Implementation Schedule\n63. The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  48  months,  inclusive  of  procurement  and\npreconstruction activities (Supplementary Appendix I). It is expected to be completed by 30\nJune 2005. The schedule will allow for land acquisition and resettlement activities and the\nclearance  of  all  utilities,  trees,  and  any  other  obstructions  from  the  land  to  be  used  for\nconstruction activities.\n3.  Procurement\n64. Civil works will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement,\nfollowing international competitive bidding procedures. ADB has approved NHAI\u2019s request to\ndivide civil works into five packages. The contract packages are large enough to attract capable\ncontractors with international experience (the packages range from $27 million to $84 million). It\nwas also agreed that NHAI will not award any civil works contract until (i) the land and rights to\nland  required  for  the  Project  have  been  acquired;  and  (ii)  utilities,  trees,  and  any  other\nobstruction from the land to be used for construction activities relating to the contract have been\ncleared.  The contract packages and the mode of procurement are in Appendix 7.\n65. To expedite the process, ADB approved advance procurement action on 9 November\n2000 for prequalification, and on 3 January 2001 for subsequent procurement actions except for\nthe signing of contracts. Based on these actions, prequalification documents were approved on\n24 November 2000, and bidding documents on 9 April 2001. NHAI was advised that approval of\nadvance procurement does not commit ADB to finance the Project.\n4.  Consulting Services\n66. Consulting  services  will  be  required  for  (i)  construction  supervision,  (ii)  training  for\nenvironmental management, (iii) award of O&M services to concessionaires, (iv) toll system\nstudy, and (v) safety audit. Consultants for these services will be engaged in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for\nengagement of domestic consultants.", "22\n67. For construction supervision, two teams of consultants, comprising both international\nand domestic experts will be engaged. Staffing inputs will be 2,630 person-months (around 480\nfor international and 2,150 for domestic) with an estimated cost of approximately $14.0 million.\nOn 3 January 2001 ADB approved advance action for engaging these construction supervision\nconsultants on the understanding that such approval does not commit ADB to finance the\nProject. Invitation documents for construction supervision consultants were approved on 11\nJune  2001.  For  environmental  management  training,  one  international  and  three  domestic\nconsultants will be engaged. The estimated cost of this activity is $40,000. NHAI will send the\nTOR for consulting services to ADB for approval.\n68. For the consulting services for (i) award of O&M operations to concessionaires, (ii)\nsafety audit, and (iii) toll collection system study, loan proceeds of the Surat-Manor Project\n(Loan 1747-IND) (footnote 10) will be used since these activities were originally included in\nLoan 1747-IND, but need to be implemented with a broader scope. NHAI will submit the TOR\nfor these consulting services to ADB for approval.\n5. Disbursement\n69. The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement\nHandbook dated January 2001, as amended from time to time, and direct payment procedures\nwill be used for disbursement of payments. To facilitate the implementation of the Project\nthrough the timely release of funds, an imprest account may be established by the Government\nwith  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  for  the  Project.  The  imprest  account  will  be  managed,\nreplenished, and liquidated in accordance with the above Loan Disbursement Handbook. The\ninitial amount to be deposited in the imprest account is not to exceed 10 percent of the loan\namount.  Any  individual  payment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  statement  of\nexpenditures (SOE) method for reimbursement of certain eligible expenditures will not exceed\nthe equivalent of $100,000.\n6. Records and Accounts\n70. NHAI will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify works, goods and\nservices financed from the loan proceeds, the financing resources received, the expenditures\nincurred for the Project, and local funds. The project accounts will be set up in accordance with\nsound  accounting  principles  (Supplementary  Appendix  J  gives  the  detailed  financial\nmanagement system).\n71. NHAI uses accrual accounting, and transactions are recorded on a historical cost basis.\nThe financial statements are in a format prescribed by the Government, and are audited annually\nby the Controller and Auditor General of India (CAG). CAG requires NHAI to prepare a balance\nsheet and a profit and loss statement. At present, NHAI acts as an agent of the Government for\nthe purpose of developing NHs. Accordingly, NHAI does not own the road infrastructure assets.\nOn the balance sheet, road construction expenditure is shown as work in progress, but there is\nno accounting policy for retaining these assets on the books once they are completed. Toll\nrevenues  are  not  currently  treated  as  NHAI  income,  but  as  accounts  payable  (to  the\nGovernment). NHAI\u2019s main source of reported revenue is the management fee received from the\nGovernment  in  return  for  completing  the  entrusted  works.  As  long  as  NHAI  accounts  are\nprepared according to government requirements, they will differ from international accounting\npractices. As NHAI\u2019s financing activities are sophisticated, its accounting policies and standards\nneed to be upgraded in stages. A road map for modernizing of NHAI\u2019s accounting policies and\npractices was agreed upon during loan negotiations (Appendix 8). To facilitate implementation of\nthe road map, it was agreed to provide TA for modernizing the financial reporting system (para.\n50).", "23\n72. An independent auditor satisfactory to ADB will audit annually the project accounts and\nthe  financial  statements  of  NHAI.  The  audited  accounts  and  financial  statements  will  be\nsubmitted to ADB not later than six months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate.\n7. Project Supervision\n73. A project inception mission will be fielded soon after effectiveness of the proposed Project\nto initiate the implementation process. ADB staff will review the project progress annually. In\naddition to the regular review, a detailed midterm review will be carried out around May 2003.\nOne item to be assessed is the results of BOT projects along the western transport corridor to\nidentify appropriate models for private-public partnership arrangements. If the midterm review\nindicates  implementation  problems,  NHAI  and  ADB  will  agree  on  appropriate  measures,\nincluding changes in implementation arrangements, to ensure that the project objectives are met.\n8. Progress Reports and Project Benefit Monitoring\n74. To monitor execution of the Project, NHAI will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports\non implementation status. The reports will be based on the monthly and quarterly reports that\nsupervision consultants submit to NHAI. Within three months of the physical completion of the\nProject, NHAI will submit to ADB a project completion report covering details of implementation\ncosts and benefit monitoring and evaluation activities.\n75. With  the  assistance  of  the  supervision  consultants,  NHAI  will  undertake  project\nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Project Performance\nManagement System Handbook. The performance monitoring indicators (PMIs) agreed upon\nwith NHAI include\n(i)  volume/capacity ratio of the project road, for measuring capacity expansion;\n(ii)  travel time, for measuring increased efficiency of passenger transport;\n(iii)  traffic fatalities, for measuring increased road safety; and\n(iv)  length of the sections (a) to be developed, and (b) to be operated and maintained\nby the private sector along the WTC, for measuring the extent of private sector\nparticipation.\n76. Initial  values  and  target  values  for  each  PMI,  together  with  the  methodologies  for\ncompiling the date, are presented in Supplementary Appendix K.\nF. Executing Agency\n77. NHAI was set up under the National Highway Authority of India Act, 1988 (the NHAI\nAct).  Before this Act, the NH network had mostly been developed through the \u201cagency system\u201d\nin which civil works of the Central Government were delegated to state PWDs. However, this\nsystem did not work well since the Central Government did not have direct control over state\nPWDs and could not ensure the timely delivery of projects. Furthermore, in several cases the\nCentral Government had to defend itself before Parliament for acts of omission by PWD staff\nover which the Central Government agency did not have administrative control. These problems\nled the Central Government to establish its own operational arm under the oversight of the\nMinistry of Surface Transport, a predecessor of MORTH.", "24\n78. The NHAI Act was enacted in 1988, but NHAI became operational only in 1995. NHAI is\nmanaged by a board comprising a chairperson reporting to MORTH, five full-time members, and\nfour part-time members, all Government appointees. Its employees are public servants. The\norganization  has  200  managerial  and  professional  staff  and  150  supporting  staff.  The\norganization chart of NHAI is shown in Supplementary Appendix L.\n79. NHAI has responsibilities to develop, operate, and maintain the NH network and other\nfacilities entrusted in it by MORTH. NHAI\u2019s immediate mandate is to execute NHDP either by\nitself  or  through  the  use  of  the  private  sector.  It  is  also  responsible  for  developing  and\nmaintaining a dozen road links connecting ports and other key industrial centers. To carry out\nthese activities, NHAI has established several divisions, including those for implementing World\nBank, ADB, private sector, and its own projects. It conducts project development activities,\nincluding  identifying  and  formulating  projects,  feasibility  studies,  land  acquisition,\npreconstruction clearances of utilities and trees, and environmental protection.\n80. NHAI  has  limited  revenues  and  is  largely  dependent  on  capital  grants  from  the\nGovernment for its highway development program. It has also received maintenance grants\nfrom MORTH of around Rs1 billion. However, the NHAI Act states that it should act on business\nprinciples. NHAI may (i) \u201cinvest funds in the securities of the Government or in such other\nmanner as may be prescribed,\u201d (ii) \u201cborrow money from any source by the issuance of bonds,\ndebentures,  and  other  instruments  as  it  may  deem  fit  with  the  consent  of  the  central\nGovernment.\u201d  NHAI\u2019s recent financial statements are shown in Appendix 9.\nG. Social and Environmental Impacts\n81. A  social  and  environmental  screening  survey  was  carried  out  during  the  project\nfeasibility  study.  Participatory  processes  were  applied;  project  affected  peoples,  local\ncommunity leaders, village panchayat heads, state officials, and a sample of persons in the\nproject  influence  area  were  consulted  about  the  proposed  highway  improvements.  The\ncommunities were supportive of the Project owing to the significant economic benefits to be\ngenerated by highway improvement, and also because of the design features to maximize the\npositive impact of highway improvement on the local communities. The Project is expected to\nbenefit the local population by reducing the number of traffic accidents, which is significantly\nhigher in Karnataka State than the national average.\n82. Underpasses and overpasses will facilitate safe crossing of pedestrians and cyclists.\nFencing is expected to minimize accidents including those associated with these road users.\nNHAI will construct parallel service roads for local access. Bus stands and truck parking areas\nwill be developed at appropriate sites to facilitate rest and recreation during travel. Shops and\nconcessionaire  facilities  to  be  established  at  these  spots  will  provide  additional  income-\ngenerating opportunities to the local people. Project-affected persons will have first priority for\noperating food and other services. Road users will benefit from increased comfort, safety, and\nreduced travel time. Perceived negative impacts are related to noise. Fences at both sides of\nthe highway will trap the vehicle noise.\n1.  Environmental Impacts\n83. The  Project  is  in  environmental  category  B.  NHAI  consultants  prepared  an  initial\nenvironmental examination (IEE) during the feasibility study stage for the Tumkur-Harihar and\nalso for the Harihar-Haveri sections. The IEE indicates that the Project will not cause any\nsignificant adverse environmental impacts as the proposed highway improvements will not\ninvolve any realignment or major earthworks. There will be no disturbance to cultural/heritage\nareas, protected areas, wetlands, or other environmentally sensitive areas. A summary IEE was", "25\nprepared  and  submitted  to  ADB  (Appendix  10).  The  Project  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s\nEnvironmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Development Projects of 1993 and also\nwith the Environmental Assessment Requirements of the Asian Development Bank, 1998.\n84. An  environmental  management  action  plan  (EMAP)  was  prepared  for  NHAI  and\ncontractors to follow to minimize potential environmental impacts. The EMAP summarized the\nmitigation proposals and allocated the responsibility for implementing, testing, and monitoring\nduring the construction phase and the first five years of the operation phase of the Project. It\nwas also agreed that ADB will finance the cost of environmental management training under the\nproposed Project.\n2.  Resettlement\n85. A draft Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) was submitted to ADB (summary in Appendix\n11). According to the RAP and the subsequently provided information, the Project will acquire\n1,601 acres of land, of which 1,341 acres is agricultural land, 173 acres is nonagricultural land,\nand the remaining 87 acres are government land. Land acquisition will affect an estimated\n18,906  persons.  However,  because  of  strip  acquisition,  impacts  are  not  expected  to  be\nsignificant.  Compensation  will  be  paid  at  replacement  value.  The  Project  will  carry  out\nresettlement in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement and its Handbook on\nResettlement, 1998, as amended from time to time. Land acquisition will impact a total of 541\nprivately owned structures and affect 3,246 persons. NHAI indicated that no relocation sites\nwere required for housing as all affected persons wished to self-relocate.\n86. Acquisition of structures will affect 310 families and 1,860 persons without formal title to\nland. Informal dwellers, both in residences and shops, will be compensated for lost assets at\nreplacement cost and shifting assistance, and will be entitled to training if they choose to enroll.\nThey will be allowed to relocate as close as possible to their present location. The PIU will\ndevelop a vendors\u2019 market if more than 50 shopkeepers are affected. They will be allowed to\noccupy the market rent-free for the first six months. Detailed arrangements will be worked out\nduring implementation and from discussions with the vendors themselves. Encroachers who are\nprivate  owners  but  have  encroached  on  government  land  will  be  notified  to  remove  their\nstructures before civil works commence and allowed to salvage materials from the demolished\nstructures. Vulnerable families in this category will be assisted on a case-by-case basis to\nimprove  their  incomes,  and  compensated  at  replacement  cost  for  their  lost  assets.  Public\nutilities such as water tanks, bore wells, and water pumps; public buildings such as schools and\nhospitals;  common  property  resources;  and  boundary  walls  will  be  affected.  The  original\nalignment design was altered to minimize negative impacts, particularly land acquisition and\nresettlement; bypasses will be constructed to avoid heavily populated areas.\n87. NHAI confirmed that a summary of the draft resettlement plan (RP) has already been\ndisclosed. Affected persons have been given one month to respond with comments. Responses\nreceived  and  changes  incorporated  will  be  reviewed.  The  final  RP  will  be  translated  into\nKannada  and  made  available  at  the  commissioner\u2019s  office  in  each  district.  The  executive\nsummary, entitlement matrix, budget, and TORs for the Implementing Agency and monitoring\nagency will be translated and distributed at panchayat offices. To avoid an influx of informal\ndwellers and fraudulent claims during implementation, NHAI issued photo identification cards to\nall squatter occupants in March 2001.\n88. It was agreed that the NHAI will establish a resettlement unit (RU) to be headed by the\nProject  Director  in  charge  of  resettlement.  The  Project  Director  will  be  assisted  by  four\nresettlement officers who will be appointed to supervise local-level implementation, each looking\nafter  a  project  district.  To  the  extent  possible,  50  percent  of  personnel  engaged  from", "26\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) to assist in the resettlement offices will be women. The\nPIU  and  RU  will  be  trained  under  the  ongoing  ADB  TA  for  Capacity  Building  for  Social\nDevelopment (footnote 14).\nH.  Technical Assistance\n89. In conjunction with the Project, TA will be provided for implementing the proposed\ncomponent for enhancing corporate finance capacity of NHAI (paras. 45\u201353). The estimated\ncost of the TA is $900,000, of which ADB will finance $700,000 from the ADB-funded TA\nProgram, and the remainder will be financed by the Government. The TA consultants will be\nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other\narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The Executing Agency for\nthe TA will be NHAI. The TOR for the TA and costing for consulting services are presented in\nAppendix 12.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial and Economic Analyses\n1.  Financial Analysis\n90. The completed project highway will be operated as a toll concession. The financial\ninternal rate of return (FIRR) was calculated on the basis of the project capital costs, O&M\ncosts, costs of toll collection, and revenues from the toll operations over an assumed 20-year\nperiod. The toll rates used are based on NHAI\u2019s existing schedule of tolls indexed for inflation.\nPrevious willingness-to-pay surveys indicate that road users are prepared to pay the established\ntoll rates in return for better service and facilities. Since access to the project highway will not be\nfully controlled, only a portion of the traffic on the road actually pays tolls. The portion of the\ntraffic that will be tolled on different sections of the road will depend on the location of the\ntollbooths as well as the availability of alternate routes, both existing and to be developed as\npart of the rural road development program. The traffic surveys provided preliminary information\non the portion of the traffic that would likely be tolled (see Supplementary Appendix M for traffic\nforecast). This was 75 percent of the heavy commercial vehicles and 20 percent of the buses,\nautomobiles, and light commercial vehicles. The expected FIRR is 11.1 percent. A simulation\ndetermined  the  sensitivity  of  these  results  to  the  assumptions  regarding  traffic  levels,\npercentage of tollable traffic, and construction costs. The results indicate that the FIRR will be\ngreater than 9 percent with a probability of 95 percent. Details of the FIRR calculation and the\nunderlying assumptions are in Supplementary Appendix N.\n91. A separate cash flow analysis compared the projected inflows from toll revenues with the\nexpected cash outflows. The latter includes the costs for not only operations, maintenance, and\ntoll collection costs but also debt service. The latter includes the 20 percent ADB loan that will\nbe onlent from MOF to NHAI and the counterpart costs that will be financed by NHAI. The\nanalysis shows that the projected inflow from toll revenues will cover the expected costs for\nO&M and toll collection, but is not sufficient to cover debt service. The latter will have to be\ncovered through the revenue from the fuel tax. The crossover to positive cash flow is expected\nafter about 7-10 years of operation.\n2.  Economic Analysis\n92. The economic evaluation of the Project is based on the comparison of the with-project\nand without-project situations. Without the Project, the existing two-lane road will become more\nheavily congested and vehicle speeds will decline from the current levels. As the level of", "27\ncongestion becomes unacceptable, traffic will be diverted to local road networks where these\nare  available  or  growth  of  demand  will  slow  down  where  such  networks  are  nonexistent.\nIncreasing  conflicts  between  fast-  and  slow-moving  vehicles  will  lead  to  a  higher  rate  of\naccidents. The high level of utilization has already led buses and trucks to travel at night to\navoid traffic congestion and to accommodate curfews in larger urban centers. Night travel will\nincrease, leading to more accidents in the evening and to greater economic cost because of the\ninability to travel at the preferred time. Accelerated pavement deterioration through intensive\nuse will increase vehicle operating costs (VOCs) along the existing two-lane road.\n93. With  the  Project,  the  highway  will  be  widened  to  four  lanes,  which  should  provide\nsufficient capacity for the next 10-15 years and allow higher operating speeds and better\ndistribution of traffic during the day. The reduction in VOCs and travel time will be substantial.\nDespite the increase in average traveling speed, the reduction in accidents will be substantial\nbecause traffic in opposite directions will be separated by a median, thereby eliminating many of\nthe head-on collisions and other passing accidents. Comparison of reduced operating costs with\ntolls indicates that commercial vehicles will prefer the toll road to a two-lane alternative even\nwith a doubling of the tolls. Comparison of the value of time savings with the level of tolls\nsuggests that passenger traffic will prefer the toll road to a two-lane alternative even with a slight\nincrease in the real cost of tolls. The additional capacity will allow the current growth in traffic to\ncontinue unimpeded and will also generate additional traffic by offering producers the option of\ntightening their supply chains, commuters the option of longer commutes, and nonbusiness\ntravelers the opportunity to make more frequent shopping trips and visits to relatives and\nfriends.\n94. Economic evaluations were carried out for the eight project sections and for the Project\nas a whole. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for 30 years, which is\nthe estimated economic life of the project improvement. The only benefits included in this\ncalculation were the savings in VOCs, which include the costs of time for truck and bus drivers\nand their assistants, but not the value of time for other travelers. The economic costs included\ncontracted civil works, procurement of right-of-way, compensation for resettlement, and fees for\nconstruction supervision and project management as well as the additional costs for regular and\nperiodic  maintenance  of  a  four-lane  road  and  the  toll  collection  and  other  operation\nresponsibilities. The costs were calculated using a factor of 0.85 to eliminate taxes, duties, and\nsome price distortions.  Both costs and benefits were expressed in constant October 2000\nprices.\n95. Because of uncertainty regarding traffic projections and construction costs, a Monte\nCarlo simulation was used to test the project benefits and costs. Sensitivity parameters included\nthe  rates  of  population  and  macroeconomic  growth,  changes  in  vehicle  mix,  and  average\ncapacity and elasticity of demand relative to economic growth. The estimated value of the EIRR\nwas 38 percent. The simulation indicated a 95 percent probability that the EIRR would exceed\n36 percent (Appendix 13). The estimated savings in travel time for passengers, if included in the\nexpected EIRR, would add 3 percent. The savings due to fewer accidents, specifically fewer\nhead-on collisions are expected to add 1-2 percent to the computed VOC benefits.\n96. Up to 50 percent of the reduction in VOCs for heavy commercial vehicles and buses is\nexpected to be passed on to users due to the intense competition in providing these services.\nPart of the savings will be paid out as tolls and part will be retained by the operators to provide\nnewer equipment and to reduce load levels to meet the tougher regulations on traffic using the\nroad. Another part of the savings will go to persons organizing the movement of goods between\nrural  and  urban  areas,  but  again  competition  is  expected  to  limit  their  share.  For  light\ncommercial vehicles, which operate primarily in rural areas, the benefits will accrue in large part\nto the users as there is open competition among operators of these vehicles. The savings", "28\nenjoyed by automobiles will be passed on directly to the owners of private cars and their\npassengers less the tolls. The users of local taxis and two- and three-wheel vehicles are also\nexpected to benefit as the competition for providing these services is intense and much of the\njourney will be made without having to pay toll.\n97. In addition to the direct benefits of savings in VOC, shorter travel time, and fewer\naccidents, the Project is expected to generate a number of nonquantifiable benefits such as\nmore reliable transport services. The benefits to intercity traffic will include a fundamental\nchange in the nature of traffic due to a significant reduction in travel time, and increased comfort\nand safety.  It is expected that larger, more efficient trucks and tourist quality intercity buses will\nbe introduced. Efforts by NHAI to consolidate truck parking/service/brokering facilities will further\nreduce bus and truck operating costs for the towns and villages along the road; the Project will\nimprove access to the major urban centers and allow a more efficient distribution of goods and\nservices, including industrial and agricultural inputs. As the complementary rural road network is\ndeveloped, the Project will provide villagers with better access to urban markets for sale of their\nlocal produce.\nB. Poverty Impact\n98. The socioeconomic indicators of Karnataka State are a little above the national average.\nAccording to the consultant\u2019s report on poverty impact, conducted in 2000 on the basis of the\ngovernmental 1993/94 survey, the proportion of the population living below the poverty line\n(PBPL) in Karnataka is 33.2 percent, which is better than the national average of 36.0 percent.18\nThe poverty-related issue in this state is, however, not the absolute level of poverty, but the\nexistence of intrastate disparities. The PBPLs in the project areas range from 39.0 percent to\n49.7 percent, which is higher than the state average of 33.1 percent, and significantly higher\nthan those of the wealthier parts of Karnataka. A related poverty problem of the project area is\nthat the higher percentage of the population is classified to be scheduled castes (SCs) or\nscheduled tribes (STs), a most disadvantaged group of people in Indian society. They have\nsuffered  from  geographic  segregation  and  are  deprived  of  various  social  and  economic\nopportunities. SCs and STs account for approximately 30 percent of the population in the\nproject area, while the national average is around 20 percent. The higher percentage of PBPLs\nin the project areas is partially explained by the higher percentages of SC and ST. The project\narea is predominantly agricultural (57 percent of the population are engaged in agriculture, half\nof them as landless labor). Agricuture is followed by the manufacturing sector (13 percent) and\ntrade and commerce (12 percent), which are usually more remunerative. Trade and commerce\nactivities are often observed in townships along NH4 and its vicinity.\n99. The proposed Project should be regarded as part of the assistance to the Government\u2019s\noverall efforts to improve the entire road network consisting of national, state, district, and rural\nroads.  The  Government\u2019s  road  development  policy  is  comprehensive,  with  the  aim  of\nestablishing total connectivity within the nation. Its emphasis is not only on the NHs, but also on\ndevelopment  of  a  good  rural  road  network.  The  Prime  Minster  recently  announced  an\naccelerated development program for rural roads. Its target is to link all villages of more than\n1,000 population to major road networks by all-weather roads by the year 2003, and those of\nmore than 500 population, by the year 2007. Strong commitment by the Central Government\nwas indicated by the allocation of 41 percent of the DRF to rural roads, a significantly larger\namount than was committed to the NHDP (33 percent).\n                                                          \n18 The latest National Sample Survey in India conducted in 2000 and published in 2001 indicated that the national\naverage of the proportion of the population living below the poverty line declined from 36.0 percent in 1993/94 to\n26.0 percent in 1999/2000.", "29\n100. The  proposed  Project  is  expected  to  contribute  to  reducing  this  intrastate  poverty\ndiscrepancy in a slightly different manner in the short term and long term. In the short term,\nconstruction  works  and  tree  planting,  together  with  ensuing  maintenance  works,  will  bring\nimmediate  cash-earning  opportunities  to  the  rural  poor.  Since  the  poor  are  generally  not\nengaged in wage earning jobs and largely dependent on occasional and uncertain employment,\nthese opportunities are more important because of their direct impact on their earnings.\n101. More significant are the long-term effects of the Project on reducing intrastate disparities.\nImproved road networks will increase the economic opportunities of the rural communities by (i)\nenabling  villagers  to  shift  from  subsistence  farming  to  market-oriented  agricultural  surplus\nproduction; and (ii) permitting local communities, particularly rural youth, to move outside for\nbetter paying occupations such as those in manufacturing or trading. Improved roads will also\nprovide social benefits such as (i) improved access to health, education, and social services;\nand (ii) increased access to learning opportunities including information technologies, thus\nreducing the sense of isolation caused by physical remoteness from cultural and commercial\ncenters.\n102. Complementarity with other poverty-related programs also needs to be emphasized. For\ninstance, Karnataka has launched a social program called Swavalambana to provide the rural\nyouth with self-employment opportunities such as poultry raising and mushroom cultivation so\nas to facilitate their escape from a vicious cycle of poverty and lack of job opportunities. Another\nexample is the World Bank assistance for the Integrated Rural Water Supply and Environmental\nSanitation Project, which is to improve access to potable water. These programs will not be\nsustainable nor successful unless an improved road network is available. A proposed road\nimprovement program will increase the chances of success of these social programs (Appendix\n14 gives the poverty impact assessment).\nC.  Communicable Diseases and Other Social Dimensions\n103. Among the South Asian countries, India has the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS.19 About\n0.7 percent of the sexually active age group of 15-49 is HIV/AIDS infected, which translates into\n3.5 million people, a figure second only to South Africa, which has over 4 million.\n104. Because  of  the  seriousness  of  the  incidence  of  sexually  transmitted  diseases,  the\nGovernment has taken a series of actions with the assistance of international aid agencies. In\n1989, a medium-term plan for HIV/AIDS control was developed with the support of the World\nHealth Organization. A national HIV/AIDS project financed by the World Bank was approved in\n1992 and extended up to March 1999. On 15 December 1999, India launched the second five-\nyear National AIDS Control Project with a budget of $230 million, comprising $191 million from\nthe World Bank and $39 million from central and state governments. This World Bank project\naims at a decentralized, multisectoral approach to HIV prevention and care, with the specific\nobjectives of reducing the rate of growth of HIV/AIDS infection in India and strengthening the\ncountry\u2019s  capacity  to  respond  to  the  epidemic  through  cost-effective  prevention  and  care\ninterventions.\n105. One feature of India\u2019s HIV/AIDS infected population is its concentration in four states/\nterritories (Maharashtra, Manipur, Pondicherry, and Tamil Nadu), with other states having lower\nrates of infection. Situated between the states of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, Karnataka has\nbecome the fifth highly infected state. The influx of construction labor in the Project area may\nfurther increase opportunities for transmitting HIV/AIDS. It was agreed that NHAI will ensure that\ncivil works contractors provide HIV/AIDS prevention training to their construction workers. For\n                                                          \n19 Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.", "30\ntruck  drivers,  another  cause  of  HIV/AIDS  transmission,  Karnataka  State  AIDS  Prevention\nSociety (KSAPS) has been providing HIV/AIDS preventive programs with the assistance of\nUnited Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID), mobilizing a network of 25\nlocal NGOs. If further assistance needs are identified, KSAPS may request ADB to extend TA\naimed at reducing poverty in developing member countries.\n106. Another potential problem during the construction phase is child labor. It was agreed that\nNHAI will ensure that civil works contracts include a provision forbidding contractors to use child\nlabor. The construction supervision consultants will also ensure compliance with this provision.\nD. Risks\n107. A potential risk to the Project is the possible delays in implementation due to prolonged\nland acquisition. The scale of land acquisition required for this Project is not that extensive\ncompared with that for the usual highway projects. Over three fourths of the land necessary for\nmain carriageways are already available. Additionally required land is mostly for service roads,\nmost of which is open land where no structures exist and thus less likely to cause major\nacquisition problems. Furthermore, streamlined land acquisition procedure recently introduced\nby the National Highways Laws (Amendment), 1997 (the NH Act) will minimize the potential risk\nof implementation delay. The new procedure has enabled NHAI to proceed with land acquisition\nin  this  Project  in  a  more  expeditious  and  predictable  manner.  Based  on  the  NH  Act,  the\nGovernment has issued public notification (action under Section 3-A of the NH Act) to declare\nits intention to obtain land for public purposes. The deadline for filing objections (action under\nSection 3-C of the NH Act) has already passed for the entire land. Objections or concerns filed\nin  response  to  the  above  notification  have  already  been  resolved  or  properly  handled.\nDeclaration of acquisition (action under Section 3-D) will be published by 31 August 2001 for\nfour of the five total contracts for 203 km, and by 30 September 2001 for the balance stretch of\n59 km, covering one contract. In addition to this progress in the land acquisition process, NHAI\nhas assured ADB of expeditious implementation of land acquisition by agreeing that NHAI will\nnot award any civil works contract until after it (i) acquires or makes available on a timely basis\nthe land and rights to land, free from any encumbrances, required for the execution of the\ncontract; and (ii) clears on a timely basis the utilities, trees, and any other obstruction from the\nland to be used for construction activities relating to the contract.\n108. Another element that can potentially delay implementation is resettlement. This risk has\nalso been minimized by establishing a resettlement unit in the PIU whose staff will dedicate their\ntime  to  resolving  and  processing  all  resettlement-related  matters  including  the  payment  of\ncompensation. It was agreed that coordination mechanisms would be established at state and\ndistrict levels to resolve any resettlement-related issues that may occur.\nVI. ASSURANCES\n109. The Government and NHAI have given the following specific assurances, in addition to\nthe standard assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  Project  Execution.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  NHAI  is  delegated\nsufficient  administrative  and  financial  authority  for  the  expeditious\nimplementation of procurement and disbursement for the Project.\n(ii) Project implementation\n(a)  The PIU will be delegated sufficient administrative autonomy for effective\nand timely decisions on Project implementation matters.", "31\n(b)  NHAI  will  ensure  that  the  PIU  is  adequately  staffed  by  experienced\npersonnel at both managerial and professional levels for effective Project\nimplementation.\n(c)  NHAI will ensure that the PIU has a resettlement unit and, to the extent\npossible, 50 percent of the personnel engaged from NGOs to assist in the\nunit will be women.\n(d)  A high level committee will be set up by NHAI within three months of loan\neffectiveness  in  accordance  with  the  RAP.  The  committee  will  be\nresponsible  for  monitoring  the  implementation  of  the  RAP  and  the\nactivities of the PIU resettlement unit.\n(iii) Highway upgrading\n(a)  NHAI will not award any civil works contract until after it (i) acquires or\nmakes available on a timely basis the land and rights to land, free from\nany encumbrances required for the execution of the contract; and (ii)\nclears on a timely basis the utilities, trees and any other obstruction from\nthe land to be used for construction activities relating to the contract.\n(b)  NHAI will ensure timely administrative clearance for removal of utilities\nand  trees  from  the  Project  highway  as  required  for  the  speedy\nimplementation of the Project.\n(iv) Road safety\n(a)  NHAI will monitor the incidence of traffic accidents and report to ADB, in a\nformat satisfactory to ADB, during the project implementation period and\ntwo years after its completion.\n(b)  NHAI  will  carry  out  a  safety  audit  for  the  WTC  during  the  Project\nimplementation period and develop recommendations to be used on other\nparts of the national highway system by 31 December 2004.\n(v)  Commercializing  of  operation  and  maintenance.  NHAI  will  ensure  that  upon\ncompletion of the Project highway, its operation and maintenance are awarded to\nthe private sector under concession arrangements satisfactory to ADB.

The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) of India is responsible for granting\nenvironmental clearance (EC) for development projects including highways. In 1997, MOEF\nannounced exemption from EC for any highway improvement project on an existing alignment\nwith \u201cmarginal land acquisition\u201d, provided it did not pass through ecologically sensitive areas\nsuch  as  national  parks,  sanctuaries,  tiger  reserves,  and  forest  reserves.    In  1999,  MOEF\nannounced further that \u201cmarginal land acquisition\u201d means land acquisition not exceeding a total\nof 20 meters (m) wide on average, and that short realignments and bypasses would also be\nexempt if the cost of the realignments or bypasses alone did not exceed $10.9 million (Rs500\nmillion).\n2. As a matter of policy, MOEF requires a detailed environmental impact assessment (EIA)\nfor all highway projects costing more than Rs500 million, even if they are exempt from EC. The\npurpose of the EIA study is to identify environmental issues that have significant impact due to\nthe  improvement  of  an  existing  highway;  assess  impacts  related  to  project  locations,\nconstruction,  and  operations;  and  propose  suitable  mitigation  measures.  The  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) put the project highway in environmental category B and required an\ninitial environmental examination (IEE) to ensure that any environmental concerns of the Project\nare reviewed and considered. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) thus appointed\nits project design consultants to prepare an EIA, which was then revised into an IEE following\nADB format, to meet the environmental requirements of both MOEF and ADB.\n3. This summary IEE (SIEE) is based on a review of the EIA and information gathered by\nthe project preparatory technical assistance (see footnote 16 in page 14).\nB.  Description of the Project\n4.  The project highway is part of National Highway No. 4 (NH4) traversing Karnataka State\nand connecting the major ports of Mumbai and Chennai. The project will reconstruct and widen\nthe present 259 km single carriageway Tumkur\u2013Harihar\u2013Haveri section of NH4 passing through\nthe  Tumkur  and  Sira  Taluks  of  Tumkur  District,  the  Chitradurga  and  Hiriyur  Taluks  of\nChitradurga  District,  the  Davanagere  and  Harihar  Taluks  of  Davanagere  District,  and  the\nRannibennuer, Byadgi and Haveri Taluks of Haveri District.\n5.  It is proposed that, the existing single carriageway be widened by constructing two\nadditional lanes and a central median along the existing two lanes. Some 24 kilometers (km) of\nbypass is proposed at four congested urban areas while, in other less congested urban areas,\nconcentric widening with a narrow median is proposed to limit land acquisition.\n6.  Service/side roads running parallel to and within the NH4 right-of-way are proposed for\n75 percent of the project length to serve as collectors/distributors for local traffic, thus separating\nthe local slow-moving traffic from the fast traffic on the NH4.\n7.  The  project  will  be  implemented  under  five  concurrent  construction  contracts.  The\ncontracts are expected to be awarded in October 2001 with expected completion date of June\n2005.", "49\nAppendix 10, page 2\nC. Description of the Environment\n1.  Physical Environment\n8. The existing alignment of the project highway is located in the plains of the South\nDeccan  Plateau,  which  is  rolling  terrain  with  gentle  slopes  and  occasional  rocky  outcrop.\nGeologically the rock formation forms part of the Peninsular Shield and comprises Peninsular\ngneiss and upper Dharward schist. The route of the NH4 between Tumkur and Harihar falls\nwithin the Tungabhadra River subbasin. The project corridor is characterized by excessively\nwell-drained clayey soils with moderate to severe erosion potential. The soil in the Harihar\u2013\nHaveri section (Km 282-340) is predominantly clayey and black and is known as Black Cotton\nSoil as it is ideal for growing cotton. Its erosion potential is low.\n9. The region gets maximum rainfall during the southwest monsoon (June\u2013September),\nwith annual rainfall in the range of 600 millimeters (mm) to 1,000 mm. The temperature is\nmoderate  with  the  highest  rarely  exceeding  36\u00baC  and  the  minimum  rarely  below  17\u00baC.\nDepending on the season, the relative humidity varies from up to 87 percent in the morning to\nas low as 27 percent in the evening. The predominant wind direction is west, but southwest for\n20 percent and east for 26 percent of the year. The region has clear visibility of over 20 km for\n300 days a year on average.\n10. The  project  highway  traverses  numerous  drainage  channels  and  rivulets  of  the\nTungabhadra subbasin including the river itself. There are more than 400 drainage structures\nand six major bridges, which will need to be upgraded to provide cross drainage for the widened\nhighway. The rivers and drainage channels along the project route are dry for some 9\u201310\nmonths  of  each  year.  Rainfall  during  the  monsoon  is  stored  in  tanks/ponds  and  provides\nirrigation for crops and water for livestock for 2\u20133 months. Two of the tanks, Arasinakere and\nMatadakere, between Km 202\u2013204 have historic importance, with associated ancient religious\nbuildings.\n11.  Boreholes and wells are a prime source of water for the population in the corridor and for\nagriculture.  Groundwater extraction is significantly high in the taluka of Tumkur, which is\ncategorized as Dark, indicating groundwater utilization exceeds 85 percent of the reserve \u2013 a\ncritical status, with little scope for further exploitation.  Water levels below ground level during\n1978\u20131997 indicate a cumulative decline from 10 meters (m) to 15 m in this taluka. The\ngroundwater levels in the other talukas are categorized as Grey (utilization 80-50 percent of the\nreserve), or White (utilization less than 50 percent of the reserve) and therefore have potential\nfor extraction of water.\n12.  Water quality in the project corridor was monitored at the Tungabhadra River and at\nsampling stations located at bridge crossings, tubewells, and dug wells. The results indicate that\nthe pH value of the water in the river is 8.4, that at the other locations range from 7.2 to 8.2.\nDissolved oxygen was 5.1 milligrams (mg)/liter at the river and at the other locations 4.2 -o 6\nmg/liter.  Biological oxygen demand was 16 mg/liter at the river and 3.5-32 mg/liter at the other\nlocations. Total dissolved solids were 145 mg/liter at the river and 324-1,030 mg/liter at the\nother locations. The results show that the concentration of dissolved solids in surface water is\nwithin safe limits for aquatic life.  However, the biological oxygen demand in both surface water\nand groundwater needs conventional treatment and/or disinfection before the water is use for\ndrinking.", "50\nAppendix 10, page 3\n13. The  baseline  ambient  air  quality  was  assessed  at  nine  locations  close  to  human\nsettlements. The air quality parameters recorded were suspended particulate matter of 136\u2013260\nmicrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m\u00b3), respirable particulate matter of 40\u201372 \u00b5g/m\u00b3,  sulfur oxides\nof 18\u201342 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, nitrogen oxides of 11\u201336 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, carbon monoxide of 800\u20131,800 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, lead of\n0.008\u2013/0.015 \u00b5g/m\u00b3, and hydrocarbons of 0.6\u20132.1 \u00b5g/m\u00b3. The average air quality values are\nwithin the national ambient air quality standards set by the Central Pollution Control Board of\nIndia for residential and rural areas.\n14. Baseline ambient noise level monitoring was carried out at 14 stations along the project\ncorridor. The background ambient noise levels of 62\u201371 decibels (dB)(A) in daytime and 68\u201357\ndB(A) at nighttime exceed the maximum limits set by the Central Pollution Control Board of\nIndia for residential and commercial areas.\n15.  Agriculture accounts for 74 percent of land use in the project corridor.\n2.  Ecological Resources\n16. The project highway does not pass through forest reserves but passes through village\nforests  at  12  locations  in  Tumkur,  Sira,  and  Hiriyur  taluks.  The  village  forests  have  been\ndeveloped under various state government programs including social forestry by the Forest\nDepartment. In some stretches of the project corridor, trees are 40-50 years old and include\ngiant tamarind, neem, banyan, and peepal. In some sections, trees on both sides of the existing\nroad have formed a symmetrical canopy to give the appearance of a green tunnel. Giant trees\nfound  within  village  limits  are  observed  to  be  focal  points  for  social  interaction,  for\ncommunity/religious congregations, or for weekly markets.\n17. There are no reports of wild life species or endangered species in the project corridor.\n18.  There are no cultural heritage sites, sensitive or critical habitats, national parks, wild life\nsanctuaries, wetlands, or protected nature reserves along the project corridor.\n19.  No protected/declared archaeological sites or historical monuments are affected by the\nproject. A fort in ruins 30 m from the right-of-way near Aimangala (Km 178\u2013179) has historical\nsignificance, but is neither protected nor declared a monument and is not physically affected by\nthe project.\n3.  Human and Economic Development and Quality of Life Values\n20.  The 1991 census shows that 83 percent of the population in the five districts of the\ncorridor are rural (the All India average is 74 percent) and 17 percent are urban. Of these, 13\u2013\n21 percent are scheduled castes (the All India average is 16 percent) and 5\u201317 percent are\nscheduled tribes (All India average is 8 percent).\n21.  The physical infrastructure for education is generally inadequate and accounts for the\nliteracy level of 52\u201356 percent, which approximates the All India average of 52 percent.\n22.  Public health facilities are available, but medical infrastructure is not consistent. The\ninfant mortality rate is 51\u201374 per thousand compared with the All India average of 72 per\nthousand.", "51\nAppendix 10, page 4\nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1.  Earthworks\n23.  An  impact  of  any  major  highway  project  is  the  requirement  of  fill  material  for\nembankments (for this project some 13 million m3).  The project highway has been designed as\na widening scheme and the utilization of the existing road, and consequently the existing\nembankment, minimizes the earthwork requirement.\n24.  The construction contractor will be responsible for obtaining the borrow material, but the\ndesign consultants have identified the tank beds and dry highlands as acceptable and economic\nsources  along  the  corridor.  The  contractor  will  be  required  to  obtain  the  approval  of  the\nDepartment of Mines and Geology of the state for borrow from the dry highlands and the\napproval of the Minor Irrigation Department for borrow from the tank beds.\n25.  Where borrow is from tank beds, the contractor will be required to excavate uniformly to\nmaintain a smooth bed profile and to regrade the inlet channels for a distance of at least 100 m.\nIn the case of tank beds acquired for a highway project, the respective tanks are to be desilted\nin consultation with the Minor Irrigation Department, government of Karnataka, to maintain the\nexisting storage capacity. These measures will support the current state program to maximize\nreplenishment  of  groundwater  resources  by  improving  inlets  and  desilting  the  tanks.  The\nearthwork operations for the highway will only take place in the dry season when the tanks are\nalso dry; therefore there will be no impact on replenishment.\n26.  Where borrow is from dry highlands, the area will be reinstated by forming gentle slopes\nand planting trees.\n27.  The contractor will be required to construct gravel haul roads to and from the borrow\nareas and to suppress dust by regular spraying with water. The haul roads will be reinstated on\ncompletion of the works and left for use by the local community.\n2.  Aggregates\n28.  The quantity of aggregates for the pavement and for concrete is estimated to be 5 million\nm3. The contractor will be required to obtain these from quarries licensed by the Department of\nMines and Geology of the Karnataka government. Quarry operators will be required to comply\nwith the relevant legislation for occupational safety and to adopt adequate dust suppression\nmeasures.\n29.  The contractor will be required to construct single-lane haul roads from the quarries to\nthe site, if not already existing, and to suppress dust by regular spraying with water. The haul\nroads  will  be  reinstated  on  completion  of  the  works  and  will  be  left  for  use  by  the  local\ncommunity.", "52\nAppendix 10, page 5\n3.  Groundwater\n30.  The water required for construction is estimated to be some 32 m3 per kilometer per day.\nIt is anticipated that the contractor will sink boreholes to obtain this water and so will be required\nto obtain approval from the Ground Water Authority of Karnataka.\n31.  The water requirement represents about 10 percent of the average annual recharge of\ngroundwater and may result in some short-term impact to the aquifer, particularly in the Tumkur\ntaluka where existing demand exceeds 85 percent of the reserves. This will be mitigated, where\nnecessary, by constructing of additional percolation tanks, pits, and shafts to increase the rate\nof recharging in the monsoon season. NHAI will coordinate the mitigation work with the Ground\nWater Authority, which is currently implementing statewide monitoring and a replenishment\nprogram.\n4.  Water Bodies\n32.  Eight tanks fall within the proposed widened right-of-way. They will be considered for\ndesilting, in consultation with the Minor Irrigation Department, to maintain the existing storage\ncapacity/volume. Impact on the water bodies will not be significant.\n5.  Water Quality\n33.  The surface water drainage system for the project will comprise concrete-lined side\nditches that discharge into the nearest available watercourse or body.\n34.  The contractor will be required to provide adequate water supply, septic tanks, and\nsoakaway pits for the wastes from the labor camps and from plant, storage, and workshop\nareas. In addition, the petrol, oil, and lubricant storage areas will have impervious floors, oil and\ngrease in storm runoff will be trapped prior to final disposal into nearby watercourses.\n6.  Landscape and Planting\n35.  Approximately 20,500 trees will be felled within the proposed right-of-way. They are not\necologically or commercially significant, but are a visual benefit to road users and the adjacent\ncommunities.\n36.  For loss of forest, the Karnataka Forest Department requires that compensatory planting\namounting  to  double  the  trees  felled.  NHAI  will  provide  the  department  with  funds  for\nreplacement planting.\n37.  In addition, NHAI will do amenity planting within the new right-of-way and will appoint a\nspecialist consultant to prepare the landscape design for the project highway. The planting\ndesign will incorporate indigenous species that offer variety and visual interest, and require\nminimum maintenance after establishment. Shrubs will be planted on the median strip. NHAI will\nappoint a specialist to implement the planting and getting responsible for maintenance and\nwatering for three years when the plants are getting established.\n38.  The proposed planting will be denser than the existing and in the medium to long term\nwill significantly improve aesthetics and screening along the route.", "53\nAppendix 10, page 6\n7.  Land Use\n39.  The predominant land use in the acquired right-of-way is agriculture. The remaining\nareas are either dryland unsuitable for agriculture or commercial land.\n40.  Land acquisition has been restricted to 20 m wide on average, except at junctions,\nrealignments, and bypasses where acquisition is 60 m. In urban areas, land acquisition is\nlimited by the use of concentric widening with a narrow median. At four locations, bypasses will\nbe constructed to totally avoid significant demolition of houses and buildings.\n41.  Service roads/side roads parallel to the national highway will serve as connector and\nfeeder roads for the local communities. They will increase safety by separating the local slow-\nmoving traffic from the fast traffic on the main road and by limiting and controlling the junctions\nonto the main road. Cross movement of the local traffic between service/side roads on each\nside of the national highway will be accommodated in underpasses and box culverts and\nbridges  widened  to  provide  for  vehicles.  Causeways  at  watercourses  will  be  built  on  the\nservice/side roads.\n42.  These measures will ensure that the new dual carriageway will not keep the local\ncommunities apart and slow-moving local traffic need not join the fast-moving traffic on the new\nhighway.\n43.  During design development the public expressed concern regarding the impact of the\nproposed widening on two historical tanks near Chitradurga (Km 202\u2013204). As a result, the\ndesign  was  restricted  to  a  reduced  width  of  right-of-way,  thus  avoiding  the  need  for  land\nacquisition within these tank beds.\n8.  Noise\n44.  Traffic on the widened and improved road will flow more smoothly. As a result traffic\nnoise  will  become  a  component  of  ambient  noise,  which  is  less  intrusive  than  the  erratic\nincreases  in  noise  levels  associated  with  congested  single  carriageways  and  substandard\npavement designs. A noise model is being developed to predict noise levels for the project.\n45.  The survey of existing noise levels in villages and built-up areas generally shows the\nneed for noise attenuation. The proposed design therefore calls for concrete or masonry walls\n1.5 m high between the main carriageway and the service/side road.\n46.  At 32 locations, 2 m high walls will reduce noise for owners of specific buildings such as\nhospitals, schools, and health centers where noise levels already are at undesirable levels.\n47.  During construction, the contractor will be required to deploy plant and equipment not\nolder than five years and to regularly maintain them. Construction work in the urban and other\nsettlement areas will be restricted to daytime hours.\n9.  Vibration\n48.  The State Department of Archaeology identified the ramparts of a ruined fort at Aimangla\n(Km 178\u2013179) as having historical importance, though they do not comprise a protected or", "54\nAppendix 10, page 7\ndeclared monument. It is within 30 m of the existing right-of-way and may experience vibration\ndue to passing traffic.\n49.  To limit the vibration and its effect on the building, a 2 ms deep buried cutoff wall of\nloose-grained  sand  will  be  constructed  within  the  right-of-way.  This  type  of  mitigation  has\nsuccessfully attenuated vibration caused by trains in India.\n10. Air Quality\n50.  The draft IEE report indicates that implementing the Project is likely to improve air quality\nbecause vehicles on the project road will be able to travel at higher speeds with less emissions.\n51.  The air quality survey shows that 5 of the 16 samples exceed the threshold levels for\nsuspended particulate matter. The samples were from congested urban areas or at junctions\nwhere average traffic speed is 20\u201340 kilometer per hour (kph). With the project providing grade\nseparated interchanges and bypasses, it is expected that these average speeds will increase to\n80\u2013100 kph, with a resulting reduction in emission levels.\n52.  At  present,  properties  are  10\u201315  m  from  the  centerline  of  the  existing  road.  The\nproposed design increases the distance to 23.5 m in urban areas. Research in other countries\nindicates that concentrations of emissions decrease significantly with distance.\n53.  NHAI  consultants  are  developing  an  air  quality  model  to  more  accurately  predict\nemission levels for the Project and the resulting impact on the adjacent environment.\n11. Shrines\n54.  A small number of small shrines, idols, and tombs falling within the proposed right-of-\nway will be relocated in consultation with the local community leaders. Initial indications show\nthat there will be no objections to the proposals.\n12. Environmental Management Action Plan\n55.  The  NHAI  design  consultant  prepared  an  environmental  management  action  plan\n(EMAP)  which  summarizes  the  mitigation  proposals  and  assigns  the  responsibility  for\nimplementing, testing, and monitoring during the construction phase and during the first five\nyears of the operation of the project.\nE. Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n56.  The  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  of  NHAI  will  manage  and  monitor  the\nenvironmental elements of the five construction packages through the supervision consultants.\nSuitable provisions in this aspect have been made in the draft terms of reference.\n57.    The  contractors  will  be  required  to  appoint  their  own  environmental  officer  to  be\nresponsible  for  their  environmental  obligations  under  the  contract  and  for  their  general\nobligations  under  relevant  laws  and  regulations.  The  contractors\u2019  and  the  supervision\nconsultant's environmental officers will liaise on all matters relating to the environment.", "55\nAppendix 10, page 8\n58.  NHAI will also appoint a part-time environmental adviser who will have an audit role for\nthe environmental works and will advise on any matters that are outside the experience of the\ncontractors or the supervision consultants.\n59.  An accredited laboratory appointed by the contractor under the construction contract will\ncarry out sampling and testing. The contractor will be responsible for undertaking sufficient and\nadequate environmental testing to demonstrate to NHAI and to the environmental auditor that\nhe is complying with all his contractual and legal obligations.\n60.  NHAI  proposed  to  arrange  at  least  two  environmental  training  seminars  during  the\nconstruction period.  NHAI staff and the contractor will be required to attend.\nF. Findings and Recommendations\n61.  Reconstruction and widening of road are likely to have significant long-term benefits for\nall road users and for inhabitants of settlements near the road. Road users will benefit from\nreduced travel time, vehicle operating costs, traffic congestion, and road accidents and will save\nfuel. Local residents will have increased economic and employment opportunities, improved\naccess to services and facilities, reliable transport services for freight traffic, reduced noise\nlevels,  and  improved  air  quality.  The  provision  of  service/side  roads  interconnected  by\nunderpasses will remove the conflict between slow nonmotorized traffic and fast motorized\ntraffic for local residents and thereby make their daily lives safer.\n62.  Because the project is a widening scheme with an average additional land width of 20 m,\ndirect adverse impacts on the physical, biological, and socioeconomic environments will be few.\nAdverse impacts on the biological environment include reduced vegetation in the short term\nwhile the new planting is getting established. Negative socioeconomic impacts include possible\ndisruption of utility lines, accident risks during construction, risk of communicable diseases\ntransmitted through contact of residents with road workers and drivers of freight trucks, and\ndisruption of community cohesion and the social fabric.\n63.  The project is judged to have some environmental impact, but the mitigation proposals\nreduce their significance. There are no permanent long-term significant impacts and therefore\nthe project is assigned to category B. An EIA is not required.\nG.  Conclusions\n64. Reconstructing  and  widening  the  existing  highway  will  have  positive  impacts  by\nimproving regional transport links and increasing economic opportunities for local residents.\nThe adverse impacts of the project will be mitigated to acceptable levels based on the IEE\nprepared by the NHAI design consultants, which will be supported by the EMAP. The EMAP will\nbe  sufficiently  detailed  to  clearly  provide  for  enforceable  action  to  be  undertaken  by  the\ncontractor. It will also guide NHAI in protecting and conserving the environment while operating\nand maintaining the finished dual carriageway.", "56\nAppendix 11, page 1\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN\nA.  The Project\n1.  The western transport corridor (WTC), comprising National Highway No. 8 (NH8) and\nNH4, connecting Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Chennai, is one of the busiest corridors in\nIndia. The section between Bangalore and Mumbai falling within NH4 also has high traffic\nintensity.  To  decongest  this  stretch,  the  National  Highways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI)  with\nfinancial support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is preparing plans and designs to\nwiden and strengthen the 259-kilometer (km) stretch between Tumkur and Haveri on NH4 in\nKarnataka State.\n2.  The Project aims to remove capacity constraints and improve road safety on critical\nsections of the WTC between Tumkur and Haveri. Some stretches on the WTC are already four\nlanes, widening work is in progress on some sections, and plans for the remaining stretches\ninclude  development  by  other  sources  like  private  investment,  own  resources,  multilateral\nfunding, etc. Contracts for civil construction for the entire section are set for award by October\n2001, with completion by June 2005.\nB.  Project Area\n3.  The project highway starts at Km 75 (Tumkur) and ends at Km 340 (Haveri) of NH4 in\nKarnataka State. The existing NH is a two-lane single carriageway. It traverses 128 villages,\nwhich abut the project road in the districts of Tumkur, Chitradurga, Davangere, and Haveri. A\nfour-lane bypass to Sira town between Km 116 and Km 122 is being developed through NHAI's\nown resources; construction work commenced in August 2000. Similarly, the 30-km stretch\nbetween Bangalore and Neelmangla is already four-lane and the Neelmangla-Tumkur section is\nplanned for development through build-operate-transfer scheme.\n4.  The right-of-way (ROW) defined for the project is 60 meters (m) in the rural areas and 47\nm in the built-up areas. Existing ROW varies between 30 m and 50 m. The stretch consists\npredominantly of agricultural land and industrial centers at Tumkur and Davangere. The other\nmain built-up areas are commercial centers along the stretch.\nC.  Land Acquisition Policy Framework\n5.  The Land Acquisition Act of 1894, with amendments, governs land acquisition in the\ncountry as a whole. The act defines parameters for identifying and compensating for acquired\nlands in India. Although a national resettlement and rehabilitation policy is under formulation, the\ncentral  and  the  state  governments  have  developed  and  applied  resettlement  action  plans\n(RAPs) on a project-specific basis. For NHs, land acquisition is governed by the National\nHighways Act of 1956, which incorporates provisions of the 1894 Act. With a view to facilitate\nhighway  improvements,  the  NH  Act  was  amended  in  1997  and  the  procedure  for  land\nacquisition was simplified considerably.\n6.  The RAP for this Project is guided by ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement, approved\nin November 1995, and based on a full census of the project-affected persons (APs). The\ncensus was conducted in three rounds: first in April/May 1999, prior to finalizing alignment;\nsecond in June-October 2000 after finalizing the alignment; and third in December 2000 for the\nremaining (15 percent) APs. The objective of the RAP is to minimize the adverse impacts of", "57\nAppendix 11, page 2\nroad construction and improvement on the APs. The RAP identifies (i) the extent and nature of\nlosses of the APs, (ii) the policies and legal framework, (iii) provisions made for compensation\npayments and relocation, and (iv) accountability in implementing the RAP. The RAP has been\ndiscussed extensively with the APs and NHAI.\n7.  The basic principles on which the RAP was developed include (i) avoiding involuntary\nresettlement wherever feasible, (ii) minimizing of resettlement where population displacement is\nunavoidable, and (iii) ensuring that displaced people receive assistance so that they are at least\nas well-off as they would have been in the absence of a development project.  On the basis of\nthe rules and regulations at the state and national levels as well as policies and practices for\nresettlement planning and management in externally financed projects, compensation for the\nAPs will be in the form of either land or cash, or both.\nD.  Project Impact\n8.  A total of 541 privately owned structures will be acquired. As a result, 541 families and\n3,246 persons will be affected. Of the privately owned structures, 204 will be fully acquired and\n337 partially acquired. In addition, 310 families and 1,860 persons without title will be affected\nby the acquisition of 310 structures. The project will also acquire 1,514 acres of privately owned\nland, with effect on 3,151 families or 18,906 persons. Total acquisition of their lands will affect\n74 families. In addition to privately owned land, 87 acres of government land will be acquired by\nthe Project. A total of 27 government owned structures will be acquired. They include social\ninfrastructure such as schools, clinics, and government offices.\nE.  Entitlements\n9.  A  detailed  entitlement  matrix  was  developed  setting  out  the  losses,  compensation,\nentitlements,  and  accountabilities  associated  with  impacts  under  the  Project.  Land  losses\nsuffered by the APs have been categorized under two heads: (i) APs losing a part of their\nhouses, and (ii) APs losing entire houses. Provisions have also been made for loss of orchard\nlands and private factory lands. In general, compensation at market rates will be paid to persons\nlosing lands. Compensation for loss of structures has been computed at current construction\n(replacement) cost levels. Income losses will be compensated accordingly. The cut off date for\neligibility for entitlements is the date of completion of the census surveys for nonholders of titles\n(April-May 1999 for Tumkur-Harihar section and December 2000 for Harihar-Haveri section) and\npublication of notification under section 3A(i) of NHAI act for landowners.\nF.  Organizational Arrangements\n10.  NHAI is the Executing Agency for the Project. The project implementation unit (PIU) of\nNHAI will supervise all planning, implementing, and monitoring activities associated with the\nRAP. The unit will be headed by the project director of the level of general manager. The PIU\nwill have a resettlement cell for each district, which will be supported by district-level committees\ncomprising  representatives  of  district  administration,  revenue,  panchayats,  APs  and\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs).\nG.  Implementation of the RAP\n11.  NHAI will engage the services of NGOs to provide counseling to APs and assist in\nimplementing the RAP, particularly in disbursing compensation packages as prescribed in the", "58\nAppendix 11, page 3\nentitlement matrix. NGOs will play an important role in ensuring that legitimate grievances of the\nAPs are redressed and vulnerable groups among the APs are given special attention.\n12.  RAP implementation, including land acquisition, will be completed within 18 months from\nthe start of the Project.\nH.  Redress of Grievances\n13.  Grievance redressal committees (GRCs) will be formed at each district. APs who have\ngrievances at any stage of implementation of the RAP may submit their grievances to the GRC.\nThe GRCs will comprise the project director (NHAI); district commissioner or his representative;\nAP/Project  displaced  persons  (PDPs)  local  representative;  resettlement  officer  (NHAI);\ncompetent  authority  for  land  acquisition;  NGO  representatives;  and  panchayat/village  level\nrepresentatives.\nI. Budget\n14.  The budget, which includes land acquisition and resettlement costs and services of\nNGOs, is estimated at Rs750 million.\nJ.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n15. Monitoring will be continuous throughout implementation of the RAP. A high-powered\ncommittee comprising of secretary-level officers of state and NHAI will monitor the functioning of\nthe district-level committees and GRCs and also the overall implementation of the RAP. The\nPIU will submit quarterly progress reports to the NHAI headquarters, which will then submit\nthem to ADB. Monitoring will be carried out for three years from the date of the implementation\nof the RAP.\n16. A  suitably  qualified  external  agency  will  be  hired  to  monitor  and  evaluate  the\nresettlement activities.", "59\nAppendix 12, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nFOR ENHANCING THE CORPORATE FINANCE CAPABILITY OF\nNATIONAL HIGHWAYS AUTHORITY OF INDIA\nA. Background\n1. Faced  with  the  enormous  financing  needed  to  upgrade  a  13,000-kilometer  (km)  of\narterial national highway network, the Government of India decided to take a number of bold\npolicy actions to facilitate highway financing. The first major action was the establishment of a\ndedicated road fund (DRF) in 1998/99, which is expected to generate Rs20 billion ($444 million)\nper annum for the national highway segment. To maximize the leverage of the fund allocated\nfrom the DRF, the Government has further decided to let National Highways Authority of India\n(NHAI) to use the fund not only for direct payment for construction but also for debt services for\nbonds issued or to be issued. This would enable NHAI to raise approximately six times more\nmoney from the capital markets compared with the direct use of DRF money. However, this, in\nturn, requires NHAI to mobilize funds from capital markets in a more aggressive and diversified\nmanner  (a larger scale and better terms).\n2. In line with this Government decision, NHAI has already issued 7-year domestic bonds\nwith a put/call option after three years. The first issue, in 2000, raised Rs5 billion ($111 million)\nfor NHAI. The second bonds were issued as an on-tap issue in February 2001. Both issues\ncarry a triple A rating by virtue of their implicit government guarantee. There are plans for raising\nanother approximately Rs120 billion ($2.5 million) through a series of bond issues. While the\nfirst two issues were made through private placement, subsequent issues may need to be\nissued to a broader range of subscribers (public placement). These larger and sequential issues\nof bonds are likely to exceed the absorptive capacity of the domestic bond markets and would\ncause crowding out of other institutions from Indian markets. Unless NHAI seeks to mobilize\nfunds from foreign capital markets, the current financing strategy may not be sustainable. NHAI\nshould look more closely at the possibility of issuing bonds in offshore markets more closely.\nThis possibility will require NHAI to disclose more financial information to the public so that\npotential investors can make informed decisions.\n3. While this direct borrowing would bring a significant amount of funds to NHAI, it would\nstill not be sufficient to implement the huge tasks mandated by the Government. It will be\nnecessary for NHAI to develop other methods of financing from the capital markets. NHAI has\nalready been pursuing build-operate-transfer schemes and has begun to explore the possibility\nof securitizing the future revenue through special-purpose vehicles (SPVs). In fact, NHAI has\nalready established several SPVs for the construction of highway links connecting to major\ntraffic generators such as ports. It plans to sell its shares in these companies once they have\ndemonstrated their revenue-generating capability.\n 4. These new alternative financial instruments should be implemented under an overall\nfund mobilization strategy. Over the longer term, NHAI should examine alternative forms of\norganization that would enable it to pursue more sophisticated financing operations. The current\nform of NHAI (an operational arm of the government specializing in highway development and\nmaintenance) has imposed a number of constraints on its strategic option for fund mobilization.\nRelative merits and demerits of the current and alternative forms of organizations should be\ncompared in a systematic manner so as to identify the most suitable form of organization, which\ncould effectively perform NHAI mission mandated by the Government.", "60\nAppendix 12, page 2\nB.  Technical Assistance\n1.  Objective\n5. The primary purpose of the proposed technical assistance (TA) is to strengthen the fund\nmobilization and financial management capability of NHAI. The study also aims to facilitate the\ntransformation  of  NHAI  into  a  more  efficient  and  autonomous  organization,  including  the\npossibility of corporatization.\n2. Scope\n6. The proposed TA will be carried out in two stages to address the two objectives in\nsequence.\n7. The first stage activities are designed to meet the NHAI\u2019s immediate need to strengthen\nits fund mobilization and financial management capabilities. More specifically, it would consist of\nthree supports for: (i) capital mobilization; (ii) treasury function; and (iii) financial reporting\nsystem:\n(i)  Support for facilitating capital mobilization. This component would assist NHAI in\ndeveloping  a  general  strategy  for  financing  road  investments  and  evaluating\nalternative financial instruments both currently available and realizable in the\nmedium term. The financial instruments currently under consideration by NHAI\ninclude: special purpose vehicles (SPVs), bond financing, and other forms of\nrevenue  securitization.  The  relative  costs  for  these  instruments  would  be\ndetermined and the potential size of the market for these instruments would be\nestimated.  Also  the  available  mechanisms  for  credit  enhancement  would  be\nexplored  including  different  forms  of  third  party  guarantees.  Criteria  and\nanalytical  procedures  would  be  developed  for  matching  road  projects  and\nfinancing options based on explicit objectives.  Based on these analyses, specific\nopportunities  would  be  identified,  and  then  specific  implementation  plans,\ndeveloped for each specific opportunity.\n(ii)  Support  for  enhancing  the  treasury  function.  This  component  would  aim  at\ndeveloping  a  strategy  for  placement  of  funds  to  maximizing  the  yield,  while\nensuring  adequate  liquidity.  Performance  measures  would  be  developed  to\nmonitor performance of the funds placement. This component would also aim at\nstrengthening its treasury function in a more general manner. The procedures for\ncollection of tolls revenues and payments for construction, service contracts, and\ndebt service would be reviewed to ensure both reliability in meeting obligations. A\nfinancial planning model would be developed in which alternative investment\noptions would be evaluated along with the projection of cash flows related to\nconstruction activities, debt financing, government grants and Cess revenues\nand operating revenues and expenditures. The model would be used to evaluate\nvarious allocation of funds in terms of liquidity and return (which would also be\nutilized for comparing various development scenario in the second stage study).\n(iii)  Support for upgrading the financial reporting system. This component will aim at\nstrengthening  NHAI\u2019s  accounting  and  financial  reporting  system.  Accounting\nstandards and policies should evolve as NHAI\u2019s financing operations become", "61\nAppendix 12, page 3\nsophisticated. Since the current bond issues are still on a private placement\nbasis, the current Government-regulated financial statements of NHAI have been\naccepted by the market. However, as the scale of fund mobilization gets larger\n(NHAI should consider first the public issuance of bonds in domestic markets,\nthen issuance of bonds in offshore markets), accounting standards and policies,\ntogether with the level of information to be disclosed, need to be upgraded\naccording  to  the  road  map  for  modernization  of  accounting  standards  and\npolicies  (Appendix  8).  The  current  accounting  standards  and  policies  should\nmove to those consistent with, initially, Generally Accepted Accounting Practices\nof India (GAAP-I), and, then, with international accounting standards (IAS). The\nconsultant should assist NHAI in its process through (i) reviewing the current\ngovernment  regulations  over  NHAI\u2019s  accounting  practices  and  developing\nrecommendations on the necessary modifications to them; (ii) reviewing possible\nfinancing operations and identifying required accounting standards and the level\nof information disclosure for each type of financing operations; (iii) developing\ntwo sets of recommendations necessary for NHAI\u2019s accounting standards and\npolicies to be upgraded first to GAA-I, and then to IAS; (iv) adding necessary\nmodification to computer models to be developed with World Bank assistance so\nthat  NHAI  can  produce  the  necessary  financial  statements  according  to  the\nadopted accounting standards and policies; and (v) training NHAI\u2019s staff to build\nthe necessary institutional capacity for accounting and financial reporting.\n8. The above activities would be preceded by the review of the current legal framework\nassociated  with  ownership  of  the  national  highways  (including  the  difference  between\n\u201centrusted\u201d, \u201cvested\u201d, \u201cleased\u201d, or \u201cowned\u201d). The above activities will be supplemented by foreign\nstudy tours to those countries such as the People\u2019s Republic of China that has introduced the\nsecuritization and raising additional development funds from the capital markets.\n9. The second stage activities will focus on broader and longer term issues. A major topic\nwill be the future form of the organization with particular emphasis on how to transform NHAI\ninto  an  efficiently  managed  and  financially/managerially  autonomous  body  such  as  a\ncorporatized organization. The main activities will be the following:\n(i)   review the results/progress of the World Bank study on institutional development;\n(ii)   review the experiences of other countries with regard to forms of organizations that\nprovide infrastructure through the public sector operating arm;\n(iii)   select possible alternative forms of organization and apply the strategic financial\nplanning model to compare the existing and alternative forms in terms of financial\nperformance;\n(iv)   develop  a  strategy  for  transforming  NHAI  into  an  efficiently  managed  and\nfinancially/managerially autonomous body; and\n(v)   hold a series of workshops on the future form of NHAI with participation of relevant\nagencies and the World Bank.", "62\nAppendix 12, page 4\n3.  Required Qualification\n10. Different qualifications are required for the first- and second-stage activities. The first-\nstage activities requires extensive knowledge on (i) capital markets both in India and in other\ncountries; (ii) a variety of financing instruments including debenture, securitization of future\nrevenue  flow,  special-purpose  vehicles,  and  initial  public  offer;  (iii)  the  treasury  function\nincluding  fund  management;  (iv)  accounting  policies  and  standards,  both  Indian  and\ninternational; and (v) legal aspects including real estate law and public sector ownership issue.\nFor the second-stage activities, extensive knowledge and experiences are required with regard\nto enterprise reforms, legal aspects of the Government organization and corporate law, and the\nprocess of corporatization.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n11. The  activities  will  be  carried  out  under  a  technical  assistance  associated  with  the\nWestern Transport Corridor Project and through international consulting firms and/or a group of\nindividual  consultants.  The  consulting  services  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  the\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by ADB and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for\nengaging domestic consultants. The TA for both first and second stages will require 15 person-\nmonths of international consultants and 15 person-months of domestic consultants. The total\ncost of the TA is estimated at $900,000 equivalent, of which ADB will finance $700,000 under\nthe ADB-funded TA Program, and the Government the remaining $200,000.\n12. The TA is expected to be for 12 months. The first stage activities will commence in\nFebruary 2002 and be completed in September 2002, while the second stage activities will\ncommence in September 2002 and be completed in February 2003.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n13. NHAI will be the Executing Agency. It will establish a task force consisting of general\nmanager-level experts of NHAI in charge of financing and accounting, institutional development\nand planning, and headed by Member (Finance). The second stage report will be reviewed by\nrelevant ministries of the Government including the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.", "63\nAppendix 12, page 5\nTable A12.1:  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\nItems Cost ($)\nA.

General\n1. The economic evaluation of the Project was carried out for the with- and without-project\nscenarios.  In  the  without-project  scenario,  the  existing  two-lane  alignment  was  used.\nCongestion would increase steadily until practical capacities were exceeded.  Traffic would then\nbe  diverted  to  available  alternative  routes.  In  the  with-project  scenario,  the  new  four-lane\nalignment will allow improved traffic flow conditions, higher vehicle speeds, and shorter travel\ntime translating into lower vehicle operating costs (VOCs). A six-lane scenario was considered,\nbut the projected growth in traffic was not sufficient to justify this investment within the next 10\nyears. The project life was assumed to be 30 years during which additional capacity will be\nrequired.  For the purpose of economic analysis, growth in traffic was capped at the capacity of\nthe four-lane road, assuming that the additional traffic would be associated with the costs and\nbenefits of future investments.\nB. Costs\n2.    The economic costs of implementing the Project were estimated from the financial costs\nof civil works, physical contingencies, land acquisition for the right-of-way, and construction\nsupervision. The construction was assumed to require four years during which two of the four\nlanes  would  be  available.  Immediately  thereafter,  tolling  operations  would  begin.  Price\nescalation provisions, interest during construction, and taxes and duties were deducted from the\nfinancial costs to derive the economic costs. The financial costs were converted into economic\ncosts by using the factor of 0.85 to take into account taxes and the marginal costs for labor.\nFinancial operation and maintenance (O&M) costs were also adjusted by the same approach to\nobtain economic costs.\n3.    Both alternatives will require regular maintenance during the operation of the Project.\nThe maintenance costs were calculated as the difference between maintenance requirements\nfor the new four-lane alignment and for the existing two-lane alignment would require. The\nmaintenance costs for the new road are higher because of the additional two lanes and the\nhigher standard of road construction and maintenance. This road was assumed to receive\nperiodic maintenance every 7 years with a double overlay every 14 years. The existing road\nwould receive a more frequent periodic maintenance, every three years, but with a lower quality\noverlay.  The  toll  road  will  incur  additional  operating  costs  for  toll  collection  and  traffic\nsupervision. All costs and benefits were estimated in constant October 2000 prices.\nC. Benefits\n4.    The principal benefits of widening to a four-lane divided highway will be increased\ncapacity, low VOCs, and reduced travel time. Without the widening, traffic above the capacity of\nthe two-lane road would be diverted to more circuitous routes, if alternatives are available, or\nthe trips would not be made. Savings in VOC would be due to higher average operating speeds\nand reduced road roughness. The increase in speed is estimated to be about 20 kilometers per\nhour for buses and trucks in most sections, and higher for automobiles. The higher operating\nspeeds would reduce the VOC in terms of capital costs and the costs for drivers and assistants.\nRoad roughness would be greatly reduced because the volume of traffic would be well below\ncapacity and therefore damage would be less substantial.  No allowance was made for the\nadditional  reduction  in  roughness  due  to  better  quality  of  construction  and  maintenance\ndesigned for these roads.", "65\nAppendix 13, page 2\n5.  Considering vehicle and road characteristics, VOCs were calculated for six vehicle types\n(cars, utility vehicles/minibuses, buses, light commercial vehicles, heavy commercial vehicles,\nand multiaxle vehicles). The values were calculated using a variation on the HDM-III model\ndesigned for the Indian environment. This revised model, developed under an earlier Asian\nDevelopment Bank technical assistance, includes operating costs for vehicles common in Indian\nroads,  operating  speeds  commensurate  with  local  driving  habits,  and  road  deterioration\nrelationships based on experience with local roads. A sample of the vehicle costs computed for\nthe Tumkur-Sira section of the corridor are in Table A13.1.\nTable A13.1: Typical Operating Costs by Vehicle Type for Tumkur-Sira\n(Rs/vehicle-km)\nVehicle Type Car Bus HCV MAV\nWithout Project 3.78 12.73 13.06 21.93\nWith Project 2.21 6.44 7.21 14.87\nVOC Savings 1.57 6.29 5.85 7.06\n   Car= new technology Car, HCV = heavy cargo vehicle, MAV = multiaxle vehicle.\n6. For the without-project case, it was assumed that traffic on the road would continue to\ngrow and congestion increase until the practical capacity of the road was reached. At that point,\ntraffic would either be diverted to alternative routes, if these were available, or the trips would\nnot be made. In either case, the costs for the traffic that could not be accommodated would be\nequal to or greater than the cost for the traffic that would continue to travel the road. It was\nconservatively assumed that the benefits to this traffic would be the difference in VOC from\ntraveling on the four-lane road and traveling on the two-lane road when operating at capacity.\n7. The VOC saving were substantially greater than the tolls as shown in Table A13.2. This\nsuggests that owners of commercial vehicles will be willing to pay not only tolls but also much\nhigher tolls.\nTable A13.2: Ratio of VOC Savings to Tolls\nVehicle Type VOC/Toll\nBuses 3.5\nLight Truck 6.7\nHeavy 2-Axle Truck 2.7\nMultiaxle Truck 2.0\n8. Time  savings  for  passengers  were  not  included  in  estimating  benefits.  A  separate\ncalculation  was  made  assuming  a  value  of  time  equal  to  one  half  the  average  wage  for\npassengers.  A  higher  income  was  assumed  for  automobile  passengers  than  for  bus\npassengers. These savings were found to add only about 4-5 percent to the economic internal\nrate of return (EIRR). However, these time savings are important for automobile passengers,\nsince the decision to use a tolled road is presumably based on time savings rather than on", "66\nAppendix 13, page 3\noperating costs.1  The same applies to passengers on buses in their choice of an express\nservice. The comparison between tolls and time\nsavings  is  shown  for  Chitradurga-Davengere. Figure A13.a: Ratio of Time Savings\nThe average is about 1.60 for cars and 3.75 for to Tolls\nbuses.  This  demonstrates  that  even  if\npassengers had an alternative slower, untolled\ntwo-lane route comparable with the current road, 5\n4.5\nthey would prefer to take the tolled road. The\n4\nratio  increases  as  the  traffic  level  increases 3.5\n(Figure A13.a). 3\no\nati 2.5\nR 2\n9.  A number of benefits were not included 1.5\nin  this  analysis:  reduction  in  freight  logistics 1\n0.5\ncosts with reduction in travel time and the ability\n0\nto travel at convenient times, the benefits from 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014\ngenerated  traffic,  and  reduction  in  accidents. Year\nThe slow travel time between major cities limits Automobiles Buses\nthe growth in freight traffic. With increased travel\nspeeds, producers will have more options for outsourcing production, wholesalers and retailers\nwill be able to operate on tighter inventories and improve responsiveness to consumer demand,\nand transport operators will be able to rationalize the use of their fleets.  Some of these benefits\nare  captured  in  the  reduced  VOCs  but  the  benefits  that  result  from  structural  chains  in\nproduction and marketing of goods and improved supply chain management are not.  One of\nthese is the greater freedom in scheduling the time of travel. At present the traffic flow on the\ntwo-lane road is relatively constant throughout the day. Trucks prefer to travel at night partly due\nto the curfews in the major towns but also to avoid the other traffic on the roads. Intercity buses\nalso tend to travel at night. With an increase in road capacity, these trucks and buses will have\ngreater flexibility in choosing their travel times to meet the demands of their customers.\n10.  Also not included in the benefits is generated traffic. Freight traffic will increase as the\nreduced travel time and cost allow producers to increase the size of the market in which they\ncan compete. Nonbusiness passenger traffic will increase because the range of cities and\ntowns that can be visited on nonwork days will increase. Business trips will be longer as\ncommuting distances increase.  Little growth is expected from traffic diverted from other modes\nsince  rail  has  lost  most  of  its  market  to  road  transport  and  air  travel  remains  extremely\nexpensive.\n11.  The savings due to fewer in accidents are difficult to estimate because data on the\nnumber and type of accidents occurring along the western transport corridor are not readily\navailable. An estimate prepared from statistics collected as part of an earlier national road user\ncost  study  produced  the  results  in  Table  A13.3.  The  reduction  in  different  categories  of\naccidents could not be predicted. However, the divided road will significantly reduce the number\nof head-on collisions, which were assumed to cause about one half of the fatalities and serious\ninjuries. The estimated value of the savings was smaller than the savings in VOCs. They would\nadd only about 1 percent to the total benefits. The savings would be more substantial since\naccidents  tie  up  traffic  on  the  road  and  cause  significant  delays  throughout  the  year.\nFurthermore, the number of accidents would increase as the two lane road becomes more\ncongested. Finally, the value associated with these accidents is expected to increase as the\n                                                          \n1 Even out-of-pocket costs are difficult for road users to determine when comparing alternative routes.  Presumably\nthe decision to use tolled roads is based primarily on time savings.", "67\nAppendix 13, page 4\nvalues of vehicles, costs for injuries, and claims associated with loss of life rise faster than the\nrate of inflation. The savings will also be greater due to the efforts of NHAI to introduce better\nsafety  standards  and  to  enforce  laws  on  vehicle  operation.  These  factors  should  provide\nbenefits equal to 3-5 percent of the total.\nTable A13.3: Parameters for Accident Cost Estimates\nType of Accident Occurrence Average Cost\n(per km-year) (Rs\u2019000)\nFatal Accident 0.67 512.0\nSerious Injury 0.31 80.0\nMinor Injury 1.77 2.7\nVehicle/Property Damage 4.05 25.0\n12.  For estimating the EIRRs, benefits and costs were calculated for 30 years starting in\n2001. This period covers construction and economic life of the improvements under the Project.\nSeparate  sections  of  the  project  road  and  the  entire  Project  were  evaluated.  Because  of\nconsiderable uncertainty regarding to the project parameters, a simulation was prepared using\nthe VOC model. The parameters that were treated as stochastic included the forecasts of\ngrowth in gross domestic product and population, the elasticity of passenger and freight traffic,\nthe initial traffic volumes (reflecting problems in reliability and location of traffic counts), the\nchange in vehicle mix over time (for both freight and passenger vehicles), and construction\ncosts.

A domestic consultant engaged by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI)\nassessed in 2000 the probable consequence of upgrading the NH4 Tumkur-Haveri section on\npoverty the influence areas of the Project. The thrust was to understand and measure the\nimpact  of  the  Project  on  the  people,  particularly  on  the  economically  and  socially\nunderprivileged sections of the population, who generally constitute the poor and the very poor.\nB. Approach\n2. The Government of India recently launched a program to rapidly upgrade the entire road\nsystem comprising national highways (NH), state highways, and district and rural road networks.\nThe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB's) assistance to the Western Transport Corridor (WTC)\nProject is part of its contribution to the Government\u2019s overall efforts to upgrade the entire road\nnetwork. This study of the impact on poverty, therefore examined poverty impact issues from a\nbroader perspective, including the issue of rural connectivity and the project impact on the local\ncommunity including the scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe (ST), and women.\nC. The Project Area\n3. The 259-kilometer (km)-long Tumkur-Haveri highway is part of the NH4 in the southern\npart of India; it connects two major ports, Mumbai, and Chennai. Tumkur is situated 70 km north\nof Bangalore. The Tumkur-Haveri section starts at the north end of Tumkur (Km 75); traverses\nthe towns of Sira, Hiriyur, Chitradurga, Davangere, and Harihar; and ends on the north point of\nHaveri town (Km 340). The landscape is characterized by vast stretches of undulating plains\nwith sporadic ranges of low rocky hills. Areas are basically dry with occasional rivers running\nbetween hills. Most are open land often used as plantations and for other agricultural purposes.\nAround 5 percent of the land is forest area.  Project roads traverse a number of small towns and\nvillages.\nD.  Poverty Profile\n4. According to the consultant\u2019s study conducted in 2000, poverty incidence in Karnataka is\n33.2  percent,  which  is  lower  than  the  national  average  (36.0  percent).1  Poverty  presents\ncomparatively less problems in Karnataka, but the issue is the intrastate disparity in poverty\nlevel. Poverty incidence in the project districts range from 39.0 percent in Chitradurga to 49.7\npercent in Haveri (Table A14.1).\n                  \n1 The latest National Sample Survey in India conducted in 2000 and published in 2001 indicated that the national\naverage of the proportion of population living below poverty line has been reduced from 36.0 percent in 1993/94 to\n26.0 percent in June 1999/2000.", "70\nAppendix 14, page 2\nTable A14.1: People Below the Poverty Line in Karnataka, by District\n1993-1994\nDistrict Rural Urban Total\n% Rank % Rank % Rank\nBangalore 12.40 4 32.51 4 31.42 12\nBangalore Rural 42.20 15 26.69 2 38.17 13\nBelgaum 27.17 12 41.98 11 29.86 10\nBellary 43.75 16 46.86 13 44.50 16\nBidar 57.00 20 56.35 19 56.06 20\nBijapur 19.31 8 55.40 18 28.98 9\nChikkamangalur 11.11 3 27.80 3 15.61 3\nChitradurga a 40.11 13 36.64 7 39.00 14\nDakshina\n06.68 1 15.71 10 8.91 1\nKannada\nDharwad b 47.46 18 52.22 17 49.75 19\nGulbarga 45.81 17 45.94 12 45.54 17\nHassan 09.50 2 35.08 6 14.44 2\nKodagu 15.24 5 40.38 10 20.73 4\nKolar 47.93 19 50.71 16 48.45 18\nMandya 23.89 10 65.72 20 30.16 11\nMysore 26.64 11 33.82 5 28.94 8\nRaichur 18.72 7 50.00 14 25.11 6\nShimoga 16.06 6 50.66 15 25.56 7\nTumkur 42.18 14 36.98 8 40.64 15\nUttara Kannada 20.10 9 38.70 9 24.97 5\nState 29.88 40.20 33.16\na The old Chitradurga district included Davangere and Harihar sector.\nb The old Dharwar district included Haveri sector.\nSource: Human Development in Karnataka.\n5. The population breakdown along caste, sex, and rural/urban areas of the three districts\n(currently five due to the bifurcation of two districts) in Table A14.2 reveals significant number of\nthe disadvantaged such as the SCs and STs who form a major section of the poor. Households\nwith female heads are relatively more impoverished because of their greater vulnerability to\npoverty. Showing these sections is crucial in a study of the impact of the National Highway\nProject on poverty.\nTable A14.2: Demographic Details of the Project Districts\nof the National Highways Project\nArea Population\nDistrict (km2) Total Men Women Rural Urban SC ST\nTumkur 10,598 2,305,819 1,177,233 1,128,586 1,923,656 382,163 408,524 167,632\n(100) (51.0) (48.9) (83.4) (16.6) (17.7) (7.3)\nHaveri 4,851 1,269,213 655,426 613,787 1,065,448 203,765 167,004 61,169\n(100) (51.6) (48.4) (83.9) (16.1) (13.2) (4.8)\nDavanagere 6,018 1,559,222 803,083 756,139 1,118,714 440,508 302,344 155,600\n(100) (51.5) (48.5) (71.8) (28.3) (19.4) (10.0)\nChitradurga 8,388 1,312,717 672,849 639,868 1,095,247 217,470 285,621 222,763\n(100) (51.3) (48.7) (83.4) (16.8) (21.8) (17.0)\nTotal 29,855 6,446,971 3,308,591 3,138,380 5,203,065 1,243,906 1,163,493 607,164\n(100) (51.3) (48.7) (80.7) (19.3) (18.0) (9.4)\nKm2 = square kilometers, SC = scheduled caste, ST = scheduled tribe.\nNote:  Figures in parenthesis indicates percentages.

The\nlargest population of the poor and the very poor are SCs and STs who constitute the lowest\nrank in caste hierarchy. These vulnerable groups of the society are physically and socially\nsegregated from main villages have limited access to basic amenities, which are by and large\nlocated in the main village. The time of SC/ST use of the commonly used amenities differs from\nthat of the dominant groups of the village.\n7. The SCs and STs in the project districts account for 27.4 percent, which is higher than\nthe state average (21 percent). The poverty-related socioeconomic indicators (Table A14.3) are\nuniformly  higher  for  the  SC  and  ST  communities  regardless  of  the  extent  of  deprivation.\nAdequate health and educational infrastructure related to the socioeconomic profile of the\nregion is both a cause and consequence of development. The principal measures of health\nstatus include sex ratio and life expectancy at birth. Educational status is measured using\nliteracy and enrollment rates. Issues of equity remain critical: access to these basic facilities is\nuneven across the state and gaps in related infrastructure are wide.\nTable A14.3 Socioeconomic Indicators of the Project Districts\n1991\nReal  GDP  per Life Literacy Literacy\nDistrict Sex\ncapita (PPP$) Expectancy Male Female\nratio\nTumkur 867 959 60.64 66.5 41.9\nHaveri 881 936 62.78 a 64.5 39.4\nDavangere 961 942 61.92 b 66.8 44.4\nChitradurga 961 951 61.92 68.0 43.3\nState Average 1135 960 62.07 66.5 42.3\nGDP = gross domestic product, PPP = purchasing power parity.\n*Haveri was part of the old Dharwad district hence Dharwad data is used.\n       *Davangere was part of the old Chitradurga district, hence Chitradurga data is used.\nF.  Transport and Poverty\n8. The NH4 is primarily used for interstate traffic connecting the major cities enroute and\nalso for intrastate and local transport. The towns and villages located on the highway or close to\nit necessarily use the NH4 for all activities, including for going to the weekly markets. The\nvillages and towns located farther away from the NH4, however, are connected to the state\nhighway and the district roads. Often a section of the NH4 is used in commuting, particularly if\nthe commuters have to reach the district headquarters or the cities for their work. Maximum use,\nhowever, is by local traffic, popularly known as the route transport, connecting several villages\nto the taluk and district headquarters.\n9. In the weekly markets, the communities purchase and sell commodities. Particularly for\nthe poor, these markets provide the space for exchange of goods. The weekly market days are\ntimed soon after the poor receive their wages. The NH4 is also used to access district/large\ntown  hospitals  for  emergency  health  care.  During  migration  in  search  of  employment\nopportunities to the neighboring cities and states, the poor use the NH4. In most districts the\ncenters  of  higher  learning/vocational  training  centers  are  located  in  towns  and  district\nheadquarters; and therefore, increased connectivity will improve the access of the poor to these\ninstitutions. Vocational training centers are gaining popularity as they increase job opportunities\nfor the poor. Sometimes they are used for social and religious reasons.", "72\nAppendix 14, page 4\n10. Recognizing the importance of the rural road network to link villages with mainstream\ndevelopment, the Prime Minister recently announced an accelerated development program for\nrural roads. The target is to link all villages with population of more than 1,000 to major road\nnetworks by all-weather roads by 2003 and those of more than 500 population by 2007.\nG.  Poverty Programs\n11. The Government, independently as well as with bilateral or multi-lateral sources has\nundertaken various programs to address poverty. The most recent one is the special economic\nprograms to form self-help groups among rural women. The idea is to mobilize women and\nimprove their quality of life. The programs for reducing poverty are in four broad categories:\narea  development  programs,  special  economic  programs  (self-help  groups),  rural  energy\nprogram, rural water supply and sanitation programs.\n 12. The programs have good objectives but face serious limitations. In most cases, the\nbenefits arising from the schemes do not reach the most deprived sections of the society for\nthose reasons: information regarding the schemes is lacking; most of the infrastructure benefits\nare  both  spatially  and  socially  distant  from  them.  Poor  communication  networks,  including\nroads  and  the  irregular  and  limited  transport  facilities  aggravate  the  situation.  The  social\ndynamics  of  caste  and  class  hierarchies  along  with  unequal  gender  relations  are  major\nobstacles  in  the  flow  of  benefits  to  the  poor.  Lack  of  coordination  between  the  various\nimplementing departments of the government and other organizations prevents the schemes\nfrom reaching the marginalized. Hence, there is a need to create facilitating mechanisms, local\ncommunity networks, and, finally, the political will to ensure that the benefits reach the poor.\nH.  Community-Based Assessment\n13. A community-based assessment was carried out in nine villages located at varying\ndistances from the highway - up to a distance of 25 km on either side - and representing five\ndistricts: Tumkur, Chitradurga, Davanagere, Harihar and Haveri. The sample comprised 332\npeople: 228 men and 104 women. To collect information and gain insights into the probable\nimpact of the project on the communities, particularly the poor, participatory rural assessment\ntechniques were used These are interviews with primary informants, focus group discussions,\ntransect  walks,  participant  observation,  and  participatory  poverty  and  social  mapping.\nInformation was also collected from secondary sources.\n14. The major findings are summarized below.\n(i)  All sections of the society irrespective of caste and class supported the project\nplan  to  broaden  the  NH4  corridor.  They  expected  the  project  to  make  a\nsignificant impact on their lives by raising the standard of living and reducing\npoverty in their villages.\n(ii)  Road users including commercial operators, i.e., small businessmen and mini-\ntransporters, viewed the broadening of the NH4 as leading to improved linkages,\nreduction in travel time, decrease in the number of accidents, lower maintenance\ncosts,  easier  commuting,  rise  in  income,  and  increased  opportunities  for\ninvestment.", "73\nAppendix 14, page 5\n(iii)  The majority of the truck drivers, who are often individuals using trucks owned by\nothers and who are also generally classified poor, expected the higher number of\ntrips they make, lead to better social security, including compulsory insurance to\nbe borne by the truck owners.\n(iv)  For the agriculturists it meant improved transport linkages to big markets, leading\nto  higher  returns  for  their  produce,  increased  land  value,  and  a  change  in\ncropping pattern resulting in higher income. It also meant reduced cost of inputs\nand supplies, and transportation, that is efficient and safe.\n(v)  Local communities expected benefits to accrue to them through better access to\neducation and job opportunities. Expanding economic opportunities for the poor\nmeans better bargaining power to negotiate for higher wages.\n(vi)  For the dalits and women, the project will positively impact their livelihood by\nimproving their access to basic amenities like basic education and adequate\nhealth facilities, easy mobility, better employment opportunities with increased\nwages, and easy access to markets. It will increase the opportunities for setting\nup production units to create alternative employment for unemployed youth and\nwomen.\n(vii)  The  poor  SC/ST  communities  within  the  village  are  often  hamlets/colonies\ngeographically  and  socially  remote  from  the  main  village.  They  expect  that,\nunless conscious efforts are made to integrate them into the developmental\nprocesses, they cannot enjoy the potential benefits to be created by a better road\nnetwork,  nor  access  to  various  developmental  programs  initiated  by  the\ngovernments.\n(viii)  Elected representatives and local leaders were positive about the project and\nexpected the flow of improved services from the government and other agencies.\nI.  Impact on Poverty Reduction\n1.  Quantitative\n15. The poverty impact ratio was calculated, but due to limited information, the results of the\ncalculation were not adequately substantiated. Instead, more specific efforts were made to\nquantify some impact of the Project on poverty.\n16. The  construction  of  a  four-lane  road  between  Tumkur  and  Haveri  will  generate\nemployment for the population along the route. Unskilled labor will be employed directly in road\nconstruction  and  maintenance  and  indirectly  by  providing  material  and  services  to  the\nconstruction and maintenance activities. Unskilled labor for constructing a kilometer of the four-\nlane highway is estimated to amount to 2,175 person-days (Table A14.4). The road contractor\nwill bring along some of his unskilled labor from previous jobs, the rest will be obtained locally.\nThe percentage of local labor will depend on the cost to the contractor employing local labor. To\nreduce  this  cost  and  encourage  a  high  local  labor  component,  it  is  proposed  that  village", "74\nAppendix 14, page 6\norganizations be utilized to recruit labor and guarantee their performance.2 The additional labor\ngenerated during construction will prepare materials at quarry sites, transport materials to the\nsite, and provide food and other supplies for the workers. This is expected to add 33-50 percent.\nTable A14.4: Unskilled Local Labor for Construction\nItem Unskilled Activity Unit Output/ Average Person-\nPerson-Day quantity/km days/km\nTree felling and Cutting, stacking,  carrying no. 0.33 77 233\nCutting\nDemolishing Sorting demolished materials sq. 10 520 52\nbuildings\nDemolishing Sorting demolished materials m3 0.5 90 180\nbridges\nTack coat Clear surface m2 100 20,000 200\nConcrete Cleaning formwork, watering m3 4 1,000 250\nReinforcement Carrying, holding, tieing ton 2 1,050 525\nMastic coat to deck Cleaning, carrying m2 10 50 5\nPaving flags Carrying, mixing, tidying m2 5 100 20\nErosion apron Carrying, mixing, tidying m3 2 250 125\nStone pitching Carrying, mixing, m3 1 50 50\nTidying\nTopsoil Spreading, leveling m2 10 1,400 140\nMasonry wall Carrying, mixing, m3 1 300 95\nTidying\nFencing Carrying, tidying m 20 1,900 95\n  m = meter.\n17. The contractors responsible for road operation and maintenance will also require casual\nunskilled labor on a continuing basis for routine maintenance of the pavement, shoulders, and\nassociated civil works.  The level of employment will be lower but over a longer period, and will\ninvolve a higher proportion of local labor. It is estimated that the average annual level of\nemployment will be 2-3 person-years per km. In addition, there will be another 3-4 person-years\nevery seven years when periodic maintenance is conducted.\n                  \n2  Contractors are often reluctant to use local labor because they are viewed as unreliable.", "75\nAppendix 14, page 7\n18. The annual amount of unskilled labor required by the Project is expected to be about\n1,000 person-years during construction and 750 person-years thereafter. The distribution of\nthese jobs between the local residents above and below the poverty line will depend on the\nrecruitment effort. If equally distributed according to the population breakdown, this will amount\nto about 400 person-years during construction and 300 person-years thereafter for those below\nthe poverty line.\n19. In addition, considerable secondary employment will be generated to meet the needs of\nexpanded transport activity. This will mean expanding of services for truck drivers and bus\npassengers by including restaurants, fueling and vehicle repair facilities, and parking areas.\n2. Qualitative\n20. The principal benefit to the rural populations in the project area is the opportunities\nprovided through increased connectivity. However, the breadth of these benefits will depend on\nthe development of the rural road network. These roads are not in good condition and often do\nnot reach the poorest villages. The fuel taxes used to fund the NHAI development program will\nalso provide funds for developing of the rural network. This will allow the more isolated villages\nto be better connected to the taluk and district centers as well as the major cities. The benefits\nwill be substantial since the economic isolation of many of the poorer villages along the project\nroute will end.\n21. Improved  transportation  will  improve  the  distribution  of  social  services  from  the\nKarnataka government to the villages along the project road. This will include better support for\nthe local medical clinics and educational facilities. At the same time, village access to the\nhospitals and health-care facilities in the large towns and district centers for emergency health\ncare will improve.\n22. The communities located along and close to the NH4 use it for visiting the weekly\nmarket, where they buy and sell commodities. These markets provide the poor, the space for\nexchange of goods. Market days are timed soon after the poor receive their wages. The\nreduction  in  transport  costs  and  travel  time  will  allow  the  poor  to  seek  employment  in\nneighboring cities and states.\n23. In most districts the centers of higher learning/vocational training centers are in towns\nand  district  headquarters.  Increased  connectivity  will  improve  access  to  vocational  training\ncenters, which increase job opportunities for the poor. Centers are sometimes used for social\nand religious purposes.\n24. Approximately  three-quarters  of  the  local  workforce  are  currently  engaged  in  either\nagriculture or some form of manufacturing/processing. The road also offers a better connection\nto central markets for the sale of local agricultural and other resources.\nJ. Conclusion\n25. The  immediate  project  benefits  that  will  accrue  to  the  poor,  who  struggle  for  their\nlivelihood on a day-to-day basis will not be a large portion of the total benefits to the rural\npopulation.  This is not surprising, given the level of the poor\u2019s participation in rural economic\nactivity; however, the benefits will increase substantially over time. The short-term, immediate,\nvisible benefits are better articulated and include construction works, maintenance works, tree", "76\nAppendix 14, page 8\nplanting, provision of services, etc., that offer immediate income-earning opportunities to the\nrural poor. The wage income emanating from agriculture fluctuates over time due to seasonality\nof operations. However, the project will generate ample employment opportunities for skilled\nand unskilled labor during its implementation phase. The project will have positive externalities,\nwhich will improve the livelihood of the poor.\n26. More important are the long-term impacts of the project, which include the narrowing\ndown of intradistrict disparities and reduction of poverty. Providing the poor with better access\nto services and economic opportunities available in the larger towns and cities is a necessary\ncondition for economic development of poor communities. An improved road network, including\nprimary and feeder roads, will increase economic opportunities for the poor, the unemployed\nyouth, and women.
