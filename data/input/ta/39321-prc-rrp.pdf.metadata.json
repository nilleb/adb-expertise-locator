An initial environmental examination was undertaken. \nAssessment   \n \n \nProject Description  The Qinling Mountains are an internationally important biodiversity \nhot  spot  and  represent  about  70%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  biodiversity, \nincluding an estimated 300 giant pandas. The Qinling Mountains \nare central to soil and water management of the Yangtze and \nYellow rivers. The Project will improve biodiversity conservation \nand  management  by  restoring  forest  habitat,  improving \nendangered  species  management  and  providing  sustainable \nlivelihoods  for  the  population  of  the  project  area,  and \ndemonstrating the benefits to the rest of the Qinling Mountains \nand  other  similar  areas  in  the  PRC.  The  Project  will  provide \nsignificant  environmental,  economic,  and  social  benefits \nthroughout the project area. It will address underlying causes and \neffects of historical and contemporary resource degradation.  \n \nThe  project  area  is  458  square  kilometers  (km2),  about  45 \nkilometers  southwest  of  Xi'an,  the  capital  of  Shaanxi,  and  is \nidentified as the birthplace of the Taoist religion. The project area \nis  divided  into  a  plains  area  for  ecotourism  and  agriculture \ndevelopment,  and  a  mountainous  area  for  biodiversity \nconservation. It is home to about 20,400 people. The plains have \nabout 15,800 residents (77% of the total) who live on about 58 \nkm2 (13% of the total project area) bordering the northern end of \nthe project area. The poverty incidence is about 23%. This area \nalso includes the township of Louguantai; several Taoist temples; \nthe Qinling National Botanical Garden (QNBG) and nursery; the \nShaanxi  Animal  Rescue  Center  (SARC),  which  includes \nthreatened species of giant panda, golden monkey, golden takin, \nand  crested  ibis;  and  the  Louguantai  Forest  Farm.  About  71 \nmillion tourists visit Shaanxi province annually, of which about \n400,000  visit  the  project  area  and  about  1  million  visit  the\n  ", "ii \n  Qinling  Mountains.  The  larger  but  scarcely  populated \nmountainous area is called the Qinling Biological Conservation \nand  Demonstration  Area  (QBCDA),  where  the  management \nobjective  is  low-impact  development  that  supports  the \nconservation of biodiversity and provides sustainable livelihoods \nfor about 4,600 residents (23% of total) on about 400 km2 (87% of \nproject area). \n   \n  The Project will produce three primary outputs: (i) participatory \nbiodiversity  management  in  the  mountainous  area,  (ii) \nenhancement of biodiversity conservation in the plains area, and \n(iii) improved project management. Using sustainable financing \nmechanisms  for  biodiversity  conservation,  the  habitat  of  the \nmountainous area, QBCDA, will be improved to promote mixed \nforest  coverage,  and  flora  and  fauna  species  expansion.  The \nsmall population lives in scattered settlements in QBCDA and will \nbe encouraged to support biodiversity conservation objectives and \nminimize unsustainable farming and other activities. \n \n  The  Project  will  develop  biodiversity-based  attractions  that  will \ngenerate  funds  for  the  management  and  enhancement  of \nQBCDA. The commercial activities will involve a botanical garden, \nwildlife breeding and research (including a giant panda center \nsecond only to Sichuan province\u2019s Wolong Nature Reserve), and \nrelated ecotourism. QNBG will address a major weakness of the \nmany past biodiversity projects by ensuring sustainable financing \nusing  part  of  the  ecotourism  revenue.  Links  with  the  Qinling \nMountains  nature  reserves  and  an  increase  in  biodiversity \ncorridors will be pursued. \n   \nRationale  The Qinling Mountains is biologically rich with many endangered, \nthreatened, and endemic animal and plant species that need to be \nprotected.  The  Qinling  Mountains  have  about  25  national  and \nprovincial  nature  and  forest  reserves,  many  of  which  have \nreceived assistance from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), \nWorld Bank, and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).  \n \nThe geography is dominated by mountains, rivers, streams, and \nforests. The major environmental issues are related to land and \nenvironmental degradation, endangered animals and plants, the \npresence of some exotic tree species, and the need for long-term \nanimal and plant species regeneration and expansion as well as \nsustainable  conservation  and  preservation  management\ntechniques.  Other  issues  include  employment  and  income-\ngenerating  opportunities  for  the  inhabitants,  the  availability  of \nfinancing  for  biodiversity  conservation  in  the  project  area  and \nQinling Mountains, and basic rural services in the project area. \nAbout 37% of the population in the project area is poor, with \npoverty  increasing  markedly  from  Louguantai  south  into  the \nrugged mountain and forest terrain. \n \n ", "iii \n  Because of the prevailing poverty, the project area and nature \nreserves  in  Qinling  Mountains  are  subject  to  a  high  level  of \ncompeting land-use pressure. This is a major reason why the \nsustainable management of biodiversity resources is important to \nthe Shaanxi government, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nGEF,  and  WWF.  However,  the  financial  sustainability  of \nbiodiversity  conservation  is  precarious,  because  conservation \ncannot compete financially with other less environment-friendly \nforms of land use. Species diversity is largely a public good, and \nthe revenue generated from ecotourism often does not cover the \ncosts  of  creation  and  management.  To  improve  the  funding \nsituation,  protected  areas  must  generate  their  own  revenue. \nBecause of its favorable location in relation to Xi'an, the project \narea will be able to generate revenues to cover most, if not all, of \nits operational and management costs. \n   \nThe Project will pursue a market-based approach to biodiversity \nconservation, featuring sustainable revenue generation and use, \nalong  with  land  and  conservation  management.  Biodiversity \nconservation is a high priority of the Government, as reflected in \nthe  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010),  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironmental Protection\u2019s biodiversity strategy, and the Qinling \nMountains Ecosystem Function Conservation Plan. The Project \nwill strengthen the management of nature reserves in the Qinling \nMountains  through  integrated  approaches,  including  market-\noriented  measures  to  sustain  environmental  and  biodiversity \nobjectives while increasing rural incomes and reducing poverty. \nThe public sector is required to ensure preservation of the natural \nand cultural heritage sites in the project area. \n \n  The lessons from previous environmental projects in the PRC and \nShaanxi  province,  as  well  as  other  major  provinces  with \nbiodiversity activities including Sichuan and Yunnan, have been \nincorporated in the Project. The provincial government and the \nImplementing Agency (IA), QNBG, have strong commitment to \nand ownership of the Project. All major stakeholders have been \nextensively  consulted.  Linking  biodiversity  conservation  with \nrevenue generation in the project area and the Qinling Mountains \nis fully supported. The Project is well focused in terms of area \ncoverage, and the outputs are well defined, closely linked, and \nwithin the capacities of QNBG to effectively manage. The Shaanxi \nprovincial government (SPG) has successfully implemented three \nADB-financed  projects  in  environmental  protection,  roads,  and \nrailways. It has also successfully implemented 12 World Bank-\nfinanced projects in forestry, water, agriculture, poverty reduction, \nand  environmental  protection.  Several  of  these  projects  are \ncofinanced with GEF. Many of the successful features of WWF \nassistance  in  biodiversity  conservation  and  income  generation \nhave been included in the Project. \n   \n ", "iv \nImpact and Outcome  The  project  impact  is  sustainable  biodiversity  conservation  in \norder  to  protect  globally-significant  species  and  to  sustain \neconomic  growth.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  Project  is \nimproved and integrated biodiversity management that provides \nsustainable livelihoods for the population of the project area. The \noutcome will also be shared and demonstrated to the rest of the \nQinling Mountains. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The Project is estimated to cost $132.64 million, including taxes \nand duties of $5.65 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $40 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \n  provided under its London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year on undisbursed funds, and such other terms and \nconditions as set forth in the loan and project agreements. The \nGEF grant cofinancing of $4.27 million was endorsed by the GEF \nChief Executive Officer in July 2009. \n    \n  Total \nSource  % \n($ million) \nAsian Development Bank     40.00  30.2 \nGlobal Environment Facility      4.27  3.2 \nGovernment     88.37  66.6 \n  Total    132.64  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.   \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to SPG \nTerms  under the same terms and conditions as those of the original loan. \nThe interest rate will be at the same LIBOR-based rate paid by the \nPRC and will be subject to the same terms and conditions as the \nPRC loan. SPG will onlend to the IA (QNBG) under the same \nterms and conditions as the relending to SPG, including a 25-year \nloan with a 5-year grace period. The interest rate payable on the \nloan  would  be  subject  to  the  same  LIBOR-based  terms  and \nconditions as the loan to SPG. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 October 2015 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 April 2015 \nCompletion Date   \n   \n ", "v \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented by SPG, the Executing Agency, \nArrangements  through  the  Provincial  Development  and  Reform  Commission. \nSPG has formed a project leading group to provide policy advice \nand conflict resolution, and to approve work plans. SPG will be \nsupported by a project management office (PMO) comprising the \nProvincial  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  the  Shaanxi \nProvincial Finance Department, and the Shaanxi Forest Bureau. \nThe PMO will be responsible for the overall administration and \nmonitoring of the Project. QNBG will be the IA, which consists of \nthree  divisions  for  the  Shaanxi  Qinling  Botanical  Garden,  the \nSARC, and the QBCDA. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Shaanxi provincial government  \n   \nProcurement  All goods and works will be procured in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nContracts  for  goods  estimated  to  exceed  $1.0  million  and \ncontracts  for  works  estimated  to  exceed  $10.0  million  will  be \nprocured  using  international  competitive  bidding  procedures. \nContracts for goods and works estimated to cost less than the \ninternational competitive bidding values, but more than $100,000, \nwill be procured through national competitive bidding procedures, \nin accordance with the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law, 1999, \nsubject  to  clarifications  agreed  upon  with  ADB.  Contracts  for \ngoods  and  works  estimated  to  cost  $100,000  or  less  will  be \nprocured  using  shopping  procedures.  The  relevant  sections  of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be \nincluded in all procurement documents and contracts. \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will require 84 person-months of consulting services, \ncomprising  15  person-months  of  international  and  69  person-\nmonths  of  national  experts.  These  will  be  procured  in  two \npackages. Package A, which comprises six individual consultants \nfor 1 month each contracted by QNBG, will be financed by the \nGEF  grant.  Package  B,  comprising  78  person-months  of \nconsultants, will also be financed by the GEF grant. The PMO will \ncontract the package through a consulting firm using the quality- \nand  cost-based  selection  method  (80:20),  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \nProject Benefits and  The Project targets residents within the project area, of which \nBeneficiaries  about 4,600 live within QBCDA and 15,800 in the plains area. An \nadditional  23,400  residents  within  the  immediate  fringe  of  the \nproject area, especially those close to the plains area, will also \nbenefit. Within the project area, the poverty ratio is estimated at \n37% on a head count basis, or close to 40% on a household \nbasis. However, the incidence of poverty is over 70% in QBCDA, \ncompared with 23% in the plains area. Poverty will be reduced \nthrough (i) the creation of a significant number of jobs during \n \n ", "vi \n  construction, (ii) the generation of about 1,370 full-time jobs by \nQNBG, (iii) indirect economic benefits provided to QBCDA, (iv) \ndevelopment of home-based businesses, (v) development of 10 \nhome-stay community tourism enterprises, (vi) provision of better \nmountain  pathways  and  roads,  and  (vii)  social  infrastructure \nprograms. More than 90% of QBCDA residents are expected to \nbenefit directly from the Project. The major environmental benefits \ninclude  (i)  better  welfare  of  animals;  (ii)  the  advancement  of \nscience  related  to  endangered  species  recovery;  (iii)  genetic \nspecies  collection;  (iv)  public  awareness  and  conservation;  (v) \noverall conservation of biodiversity; (vi) better ecological functions \nfrom more and higher-quality forest cover; (vii) intangible benefits \nfrom the conservation of Taoist religious sites; and (viii) better \nenvironmental  quality  through  improvements  in  sanitation, \nwastewater, and management systems.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  Delays in construction would place significant pressure on the \ncash flow of QNBG. Recognizing this risk, the SPG has committed \nto  underwrite  the  cash  flow  with  counterpart  funds.  Weak \nmanagement and poor operation of the proposed investments will \nthreaten the financial viability of QNBG, which is assessed as \nadequate but not strong. All of the agencies consolidated into \nQNBG, including the Shaanxi Qinling Botanical Garden, SARC, \nand the Louguantai Forest Farm, have many years of biodiversity \nproject experience. QNBG is well staffed with experienced and \nqualified  personnel.  The  challenge  for  QNBG  will  be  to  work \ntogether  to  effectively  manage  all  project  activities  related  to \nhabitat  restoration,  species  regeneration,  botanical  gardens, \nSARC,  ecotourism,  and  income-generating  activities  for  poor \nresidents in the mountainous and plains areas. The SPG has \nagreed to strengthen QNBG by providing additional staff, start-up \nfunds, and sufficient staff training. QNBG will undergo institutional \nstrengthening through the use of consulting services, as well as \nthe  recruitment  of  expert  and  experienced  staff  in  biodiversity \nconservation,  ecotourism  promotion,  management,  and \nengineering. The financial sustainability of QNBG and the Project \nwill be ensured through ecotourism revenue generation sufficient \nto meet all projected operation and maintenance costs, plus the \nexpansion  of  biodiversity  conservation  activities  in  the  Qinling \nMountains. The design of the Project has factored in the potential \nrisks from invasive species and poor animal welfare by introducing \ninternational expertise and limiting QNBG to plant species from \nthe Qinling Mountains. The risks of food supply shortages and \nprice increases because of the resettlement of affected farmers in \nthe  plains  area  are  considered  minimal,  even  in  local  village \nmarkets.  The  risks  associated  with  agricultural  or  other \nencroachment on forest land are also considered minimal. QNBG \nis  adequately  staffed  to  enforce  regulations  regarding \nencroachment on forest land, and will employ local residents as \nforest monitors and ecotourism guides. \n \n ", "Map 1\n107 o 00'E 110o  00'E\nSHAANXI QINLING BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AND\nDEMONSTRATION PROJECT\nIN THE Fugu\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA \nShenmu\nINNER    MONGOLIA\nYulin K\n38o  00'N NINGXIA Dingbian HengshanYuxi He TuweiHe uye HHue(aYnegl loHew River) 38o  00'N\nJingbian Suide\nWubu\nWuqi Ansai XuyYQaanin nHcgehjiaunan Wudinge H S H A N X I\nZhidan e\nPPrroojveinctc iAarl eCaapital Yan  HYan'an Yanchang\ne\nCounty\nNational Road YAN'AN\nOther Road Fuxian Yichuan\nRailway\nRiver\nPrefecture Boundary Huanglung\nHuangling\nProvincial Boundary\nHancheng\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\nXunyi\nTongchuan\nPucheng\nBinxian\nFuping\nGANSU Longxian BAOJI Qianxian XIANYANG WEINAN Dali Huang He(YellowRiver)\nWeinan\nBaoji Xianyang Lintong\nXI'AN Luonan\nHENAN\nHuxian\nTaibai Shangluo\nFengxian Zhashuin Danfeng\nZhen'an\nShangnan\nLiuba Fuping\nHANZHONG\nNingshan\nChenggu\nYangxian\nShiquan\n33o  00'N Mianxian 33o  00'N\nHanzhong Hanyin\nXixiang Baihe\nAnkang\nANKANG\nHUBEI\nPingli\nN\nS I C H U A N\nQinling Biological Conservation 0 50 100\nand Demonstration Area\nKilometers\n107 o 00'E 110o  00'E\n09-3417a HR", "Map 2\nSHAANXI QINLING BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION AND\nDEMONSTRATION PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA \nLouguantai\nYanshengguan Dianzhen Dagu\nTayu\nJ\niu\nyu Louguantai Daoist Temple\n R T\niv ia\ner ny\nu\n R\nHoudongming iver Chiyu Gencyucun\nJioulong\nHouhuanghi Macha Qianyu\nWangmuling\nHouyu Lixin\nRiver Xinglong QINLING BIOLOGICAL\nuyu  CONSERVATION AND\nJi Jinlin DEMONSTRATION AREA\nHeping\nXingfeng\nSanhe\nT\nia\nn\ny\nu\n R\niv\ne\nr\nQinling National Botanical Garden Qinling\nShaanxi Animal Rescue Center and\nSatellite Center\nTownship\nVillage\nLouguantai Forest Farm\nLouguantai Hot Spring\nExisting Road N\nRiver\nProject Boundary\nProtected Area Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n09-3417b HR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and (ii) proposed administration of a grant from \nthe Global Environment Facility (GEF), both for the Shaanxi Qinling Biodiversity Conservation \nand Demonstration Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Shaanxi province is home to about 2.8% of the country\u2019s population, contributes about \n1.8% to its gross domestic product (GDP), and has about 2.1% of the PRC\u2019s land area (206,000 \nsquare kilometers [km2]). The rate of economic growth in the western PRC has lagged the \neastern provinces. Shaanxi province grew on average of about 7.5% per year during 1990\u2013\n2000, compared with a national average of about 10%. When coupled with population growth, \nGDP per capita in Shaanxi is only about 60% of the national average. Since 2000, Shaanxi has \ngrown  more  quickly,  equaling  or  exceeding  the  national  average  largely  because  of  the \nimplementation of the western development strategy under the country\u2019s 10th Five-Year Plan \n(FYP). During 2000\u20132007, Shaanxi\u2019s GDP grew on average of about 11% per year, faster than \nthe national average; and Shaanxi\u2019s per capita GDP was about 63% of the national average. Of \nthe 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and independent municipalities in the PRC, Shaanxi \nranks 16th in population size, 22nd in terms of the size of the economy and production base (as \nmeasured by GDP and industrial production), and 26th in GDP per capita.  \n \n3.   The capital, Xi'an, accounts for 21% of the population, but it produces more than 40% of \nthe province\u2019s GDP. The GDP per capita in the poorer rural counties of Shaanxi is less than \n30% of the national average, and 55 of the 88 counties are classified as poor. In 2008, the \naverage annual income of Shaanxi urban residents was CNY12,858 while the per capita income \nof the rural population was CNY3,136. Rural incomes are only 35% of the $1.25 per day \nbenchmark for extreme poverty and about 50% of the average provincial income. Low living \nstandards and high levels of poverty are a result of past natural resource degradation and a \ncause for ongoing degradation. Many of the counties classified as poor are in the Qinling \nMountains, including Zhouzhi County where the Project is located. \n \n4.   The success of the Shaanxi province under the 11th FYP (2006\u20132010) depends heavily \non protecting the biological and natural assets from which ecotourism products and services can \nbe developed. The main natural asset is the Qinling Mountains range, which is immediately to \nthe southwest of Xi'an and runs east-west, straddling the southern part of Shaanxi. More than \n90% of the range lies within Shaanxi province, where it forms a north-south divide and is a \nmajor climatic influence on the northern PRC and the water resources of the Yellow and \nYangtze rivers. The southern slopes contribute more than 50% of the water stored in the \nDanjiangkou Reservoir on the Han River, a tributary of the Yangtze River. The northern slopes \nsupply water to the Yellow River system, which flows to the dry northern parts of the country. \nThe Qinling Mountain range is the most valuable environmental and biological resource for \nfuture biodiversity conservation in Shaanxi. \n \n5.   The development of cities and counties, and the use of the Qinling Mountains forestry \nand  biodiversity  resources,  began  more  than  2,000  years  ago  during  the  Qin  and  Han \ndynasties. Currently, the Qinling Mountains support about 5 million residents, or about 14% of \nthe Shaanxi population. The Qinling Mountains, which consist of a temperate broad-leaved and \nmixed forest, is a global biodiversity hot spot supporting many endangered and endemic plant ", "2   \nand animal species.1 The endangered species include the giant panda, the global icon of \nconservation, and the only known wild population of one of the world\u2019s rarest birds, the crested \nibis (the national bird of Japan). The Qinling Mountains are characterized by very high levels of \nendemic biodiversity and a vertical spectrum of vegetation types. Of all the vegetation types in \nthe PRC, about 70% can be found in the Qinling Mountains.2 \n \n6.  The project area is in the Qinling Mountains, about 45 kilometers (km) from Xi'an, and \ncovers a rural area of about 458 km2 with about 20,400 people. The geography is dominated by \nmountains, rivers, streams, and forests. About 37% of the population is poor, with poverty \nincreasing markedly south of the plains into the rugged mountain and forest terrain. About \n15,800 people live in the 2-km strip of plains along the national 4-lane east-west highway (an \narea of about 58 km2) that borders the northern end of the project area. In this area, which is \nlargely dependent on agriculture, the poverty incidence is about 23%. This area also includes \nthe small town of Louguantai; several Taoist temples (Taoism was founded here); the Shaanxi \nAnimal Rescue Center (SARC), which includes the threatened species of giant panda, golden \nmonkey, golden takin, and crested ibis; the Louguantai Forest Farm (LFF); the Qinling National \nBotanical Garden (QNBG); and the Louguantai hot springs. Shaanxi wants to divide its tourism \nproducts into two major categories of attractions: historical and environmental. The strategy \nstresses the need to increase the value of each visitor, as opposed to increasing the number of \nvisitors. It lists 10 priority-tourism developments including QNBG.3 About 71 million tourists visit \nShaanxi province annually, of which about 400,000 visit the project area and about 1 million visit \nthe  Qinling  Mountains.  Based  on  survey  results,  an  additional  4,600  people  live  in  the \nmountainous interior, widely spread out in several villages in the 400 km2 Qinling Biological \nConservation and Demonstration Area (QBCDA). Poverty incidence in this area is about 70%.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Project Area Situation \n \n7.  The key problems affecting the Qinling Mountains and the project area include (i) loss of \nbiodiversity, (ii) low incomes and limited jobs for the poor inhabitants, and (iii) poor institutional \neffectiveness and coordination to manage biodiversity conservation and natural resources. The \nproblem  tree  analysis  is  in  Appendix  2.  The  major  problems  are  related  to  land  and \nenvironmental degradation, animals and plants (including forest) endangered or under threat, \nthe presence of some exotic or alien tree species, the need for long-term species regeneration \nand  expansion,  and  the  need  for  sustainable  conservation  and  preservation  management \ntechniques. The loss of biological resources, ecosystems, and habitats for rare and endangered \nspecies  is  strongly  correlated  with  habitat  loss  because  of  land  degradation.  As  such, \nbiodiversity conservation and habitat restoration in the Qinling Mountains and the project area \n                                                 \n1  Eight animal species are in class I, including the giant panda, golden monkey, golden takin, crested ibis, clouded \nleopard, and oriental white stork; and 34 animal species are in class II. The Qinling Mountains have considerable \nbiodiversity with more than 3,100 plant species and more than 600 animal species. The Qinling Mountains have \nWorld Wide Fund for Nature conservation status. \n2  More than 15 animal species are on the national priority protection  wildlife list, including the giant panda \n(Ailuropoda  melanoleuca),  golden  takin  (Budorcas  taxicolor),  golden  snub-nosed  monkey  (Rhinopithecus \nroxellana), crested ibis (Nipponia nippon), brown-eared pheasant (Crossoptilon mantchuricum), red panda (Ailurus \nfulgens), clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa), and giant salamander (Andrias davidianus). The Qinling Mountains, \nhome to about 20% of the People's Republic of China's (PRC) total wild panda population, has the highest giant \npanda population density in the country. Many important plant species are endemic (1,428 species), relic, rare, or \nendangered, including the ginkgo, one of the oldest tree species in the world. The Chinese mountain larch (Larix \nchinensis), oneflower kingdonia (Kingdonia uniflora), the important source-species of the cultivated peony (Paeonia \nsuffruticosa), the Mao-tai maple (Acer miaotaiense), and the Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) are also \nendangered and listed by the Government as protected species. \n3  The Qinling National Botanical Garden (QNBG) obtained national botanical garden status, and is one of only two \nsuch gardens in the PRC. The other is in Shanghai. \n ", "  3\nrequire interventions that respond to land degradation and its underlying causes. The practice of \nagriculture on sloped land is a continuous threat to biodiversity. Simultaneously, deforestation \nhas given rise to shrub lands and the replanting of exotic species that crowd out native tree and \nshrub species. However, many other less-severely degraded areas have options for restoring, \nsustaining, and enhancing the productive capacity of the land for mixed forests through the \nadoption of the appropriate controls and better land management measures. The Project will \naddress all these major problems. \n \n8.   Despite these problems affecting the Qinling Mountains and the project area, they offer \nmany  opportunities  to  address  biodiversity  loss,  low  incomes  and  limited  jobs,  and  poor \nmanagement of biological resources. Through ongoing and planned economic opportunities that \ndo not adversely affect the biodiversity conservation objectives, more visitors to the Qinling \nMountains may choose to visit the wildlife facilities, botanical gardens, hot springs, religious \nsites, and protected biodiversity areas, raising revenues and generating more jobs for residents. \nSecured land rights on community forest lands coupled with income-generating activities, such \nas those popularized in the Qinling Mountains by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), can \nlead  to  more  sustainable  and  environment-friendly  activities  of  QBCDA  and  other  Qinling \nMountains residents. More reforestation on community and state forestry lands of indigenous \nspecies will encourage the restoration of land to original conditions, which will lead to the \ngradual  proliferation  of  endangered  and  threatened  species  of  plants  and  animals.  More \neffective management and agency coordination of biodiversity including at the SARC, and the \ngradual  and  scientific  reintroduction  of  captured  animals  to  the  wild,  will  also  support  the \nregeneration of the natural environment. Better links and an increase in biodiversity corridors \ncan improve all nature reserves and forest reserves of the Qinling Mountains. Institutional and \ncommunity strengthening activities will encourage better planning, design, implementation, and \nmonitoring of infrastructure, forestry, agriculture, and income-generating activities. As a result, \nthe  project  area  can  generate  more  ecotourism  revenue,  as  well  as  jobs  and  income \nopportunities. Some of this additional revenue can be used for more effective and sustainable \nbiodiversity conservation in the Qinling Mountains and the project area. \n \n2.  Government Policies and ADB\u2019s Country Strategy  \n \n9.  The PRC aims to conserve 90% of key wild plants through state protection by 2010. To \nreverse land degradation, the Government instituted the Sloping Land Conversion Program \n(known as the \u201cgrain for green\u201d program) in 2000. The program provided grain, cash, and \nsaplings to farmers who convert their steep farmlands to grassland or woodland. The program \nhas been carried out on 600,000\u2013800,000 hectares (ha) in the Qinling Mountains, including a \nportion of the project area. The PRC ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity in January \n1993,  and  has  implemented  many  of  the  actions  required  by  the  convention  to  achieve \nratification. The Government also approved the Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan in June \n1994. The Government approved the first National Strategy for Plant Conservation in February \n2008 to document and conserve plant diversity, and to generate public awareness. The system \nof nature reserves and forest reserves in the Qinling Mountains has been expanded, particularly \nin eastern areas. The financing and management of the 25 nature reserves4 in the Qinling \nMountains have been significantly improved in the past few years.  \n \n10.  The Qinling Mountains are listed as one of the 11 most critical regions for biodiversity \nconservation in the PRC,5 and the Ministry of Environmental Protection nominated the Qinling \n                                                 \n4  This number covers 19 nature reserves that are administered by the Shaanxi Forest Administration and forestry \ndepartments and bureaus at the provincial and local government levels, and six smaller nature reserves managed \nby other government agencies such as water resources and the Environmental Protection Bureau.   \n5  State Environmental Protection Administration. 1998. China\u2019s Biodiversity: A Country Study. Beijing (it is now \nknown as the Ministry of Environmental Protection). \n ", "4   \nMountains Ecosystem Function Conservation Area (QMEFCA) as a national pilot program in \n2001. The strategies proposed to protect the Qinling Mountains include (i) establishing joint \nmanagement  with  forest  bureau  staff  and  villagers;  (ii)  establishing  biological  corridors  to \ncounter  the  impacts  of  highways  and  railways;  (iii)  strengthening  management  of  nature \nreserves and forest reserves along highways to counter illegal entry by villagers and livestock, \nand blockage of wildlife movements by fences installed to protect natural forests; (iv) enhancing \nthe administration of, and increasing investment in, nature reserves and forest reserves; (v) \nimproving tourism management; and (vi) diversifying village enterprises. \n \n11.   The Government has introduced subsidy programs to encourage voluntary resettlement \nout of the mountainous area. In 2007, the Shaanxi government announced a program to reform \nforest lands owned by the state and collectives to improve forest management by contracting \nmore user rights to farmers and other investors for up to 70 years. Such land-use policies will be \nessential to achieving the permanent forest cover that will enable households to improve their \nlivelihoods from lands that are too steep for cultivation. The New Socialist Countryside Policy of \n2006 emphasizes accelerating rural income growth, acknowledging that the persistent decline in \nnatural resources and the deteriorating environment need to be addressed.6  \n \n12.   The project area is included within the Southern Shaanxi Regional Strategy, which \nprioritizes  sustainable  economic  development,  conservation  and  protection  of  ecological \nresources and functions, and the need to build local enterprises to address rural poverty by \nlinking the rural poor to local value-adding industry and market chains. Tourism, including \necotourism, is also identified as an important element of the economic development strategy. \n \n13.   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy for the PRC (2008\u2013\n2010) supports poverty reduction and investment that improves the quality of life for those on \nlow incomes.7 It also provides assistance to protect natural resources and environmental assets, \nespecially those that have regional or even international significance. ADB\u2019s operations will \nsupport  the  Government\u2019s  policies  with  a  focus  on  improving  equity  and  environmental \nsustainability. \n \n  3.  External Assistance \n \n14.   Biodiversity  conservation  programs  have  been  well  supported  within  the  Qinling \nMountains  since  1985  when  the  first  World  Bank-GEF  protected  area  and  nature  reserve \nprogram was implemented (Appendix 3). The program sought to strengthen nature reserve \nmanagement capacity, and to introduce new approaches to conservation management built on \ndevelopment-partner collaboration. WWF has supported species management for the giant \npanda, habitat protection and restoration, capacity building programs, and rural livelihood and \necotourism programs in the Qinling Mountains with considerable success and influence. WWF\u2019s \nQinling Panda Focal Project emphasizes cooperation with nontraditional conservation forces, \nsuch  as  national  and  regional  government  projects  and  economic  development  activities \n(Appendix 3). The Government has implemented some related initiatives over the past decade \nwith ADB and other international partners. Related programs and projects that will offer valuable \nlinks and potential collaboration with this Project include the ongoing PRC-GEF Partnership on \nLand  Degradation  in  Dryland  Ecosysbtems,  and  the  Capacity  Building  to  Combat  Land \nDegradation  Project  cofinanced  by  ADB  and  GEF.8 Land  degradation,  especially  through \n                                                 \n6  Communist Party of China Central Committee. 2007.

The World Bank has successfully implemented 12 environmental improvement \nprojects in Shaanxi, while the International Fund for Agricultural Development has implemented \none project. Japan has also implemented one reforestation project in Shaanxi. The total value of \nthese projects exceeds $1 billion (Appendix 4). \n \n  4.  Lessons \n \n15.   The following lessons are derived from similar ADB projects: (i) provincial governments \nshould ensure strong ownership; (ii) an effective provincial-level leading group is necessary to \nprovide leadership and guidance; (iii) commercial operations should adopt a flexible approach, \nand be sensitive to changes in market demand and prices; and (iv) consultants must support \ninstitutional capacity building of the stakeholders involved, including project management. Key \nlessons from World Bank-funded projects (Appendix 3) include the need to (i) build in financial \nsustainability, (ii) involve local people, (iii) identify community forest rights and responsibilities in \nresource use, and (iv) establish supportive policies and incentives for resource conservation. \nKey  lessons  from  GEF\u2019s  experience  with  global  projects  and  activities  in  biodiversity \nconservation include the need to ensure stakeholder participation through user groups, village \nproject committees, and decentralization of project management. Close cooperation among \nmajor stakeholders, including local government agencies, nongovernment organizations, and \nlocal inhabitants, was found to be critical to project success. \n \n16.  The lessons from previous agriculture and environment projects in the PRC and Shaanxi \nprovince, as well as in other major provinces with biodiversity activities including Sichuan and \nYunnan  provinces,  have  been  incorporated  in  the  Project.  The  provincial  government  and \nQNBG, as the Implementing Agency (IA), have a strong commitment to and ownership of the \nProject.  All  major  stakeholders  have  been  extensively  consulted.  Linking  biodiversity \nconservation  with  revenue  generation  in  project  area  and  the  Qinling  Mountains  is  fully \nsupported. The Project is well focused in terms of area coverage, and the outputs are well \ndefined, closely linked, and within the capacities of QNBG to effectively manage.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The expected impact of the Project is sustainable biodiversity conservation to protect \nglobally-significant species and sustain economic growth. This will be measured by a reduction \nin degraded land and soil erosion, an increase in the area that protects endangered species, \nand an increase in rural incomes and employment. Livelihood diversification, including the ability \nof the rural poor to access higher-paying employment, will increase rural incomes and skills. \nBiodiversity conservation will be enhanced through habitat protection and restoration programs \nlinked to conservation forestry, stronger management, and species management programs \noutside their original location, and extensive awareness and education programs. \n \n18.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  Project  will  be  improved  and  integrated  biodiversity \nmanagement,  providing  sustainable  livelihoods  for  the  population  of  the  project  area.  The \noutcome will also be shared and demonstrated to the rest of the Qinling Mountains. The Project \nwill provide significant environmental, economic, and social benefits throughout the project area. \nThe Project will address underlying causes and effects of historical and contemporary resource \ndegradation. The main monitoring indicators will be (i) livelihood improvements for farmers and \nQBCDA residents, (ii) management plans prepared for at least five endangered species, (iii) \nincreases in quantity and quality of habitat within the project area, and (iv) contributions to well-\nmanaged conservation breeding programs. \n ", "6   \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n1.  Participatory Biodiversity Management in the Mountainous Area \n \n19.   This component will support (i) the demonstration of biodiversity conservation, and (ii) \nforest-based livelihoods for poor villages through restoration of about 7,000 ha of forest habitat \nsuitable for the indigenous flora and fauna. The mountainous area is not suitable for agriculture, \nbut has been used to grow some food on steeply sloping lands. Biodiversity conservation in the \nproject area and elsewhere in the Qinling Mountains will be financed with revenue from QNBG \n(including SARC) through an innovative revenue-sharing and redistribution program. QNBG will \ntransfer grant funds annually to QBCDA. QNBG will ensure that sufficient funds are available for \nQBCDA.9 \n \n20.  Demonstrating  Conservation  of  Biodiversity.  This  subcomponent  will  have  three \nmajor activities: (i) restoration of state forest land managed by the Shaanxi Forest Bureau \n(SFB),  (ii)  preparation  of  a  forest  management  plan,  and  (iii)  development  of  endangered \nspecies management programs. About 2,000 ha of habitat on state forest land will be restored \nfor ecological research, forest silviculture, understory planting, and canopy manipulation. State \nforest land is managed by SFB throughout the Qinling Mountains, and specifically by QNBG in \nQBCDA. The objective of habitat restoration is to transform the existing monoculture into mixed \nforest cover. Non-endemic species will not be introduced into the forest area. Existing non-\nendemic species will be identified and removed during the reforestation. QBCDA has been \nselected as a demonstration and training site for those working in other parts of the Qinling \nMountains. In effect, it will function as a field conservation training and demonstration area. \nMethods and skills will be developed and lessons disseminated from the area. A detailed forest \nand habitat management plan will be prepared consistent with the village development plans for \nQBCDA as a training program for agency staff in the Qinling Mountains. QNBG will work with \nlocal inhabitants to develop the plans and implement the habitat restoration programs in a \nparticipatory manner conducive to adoption of more sustainable livelihood activities. The local \ninhabitants, assisted by QNBG, will be responsible for habitat restoration management. QNBG \nwill provide training and employment to participating QBCDA inhabitants to restore mixed forest \nhabitat. The costs for land preparation, nurseries and seedlings, planting, establishment and \nmaintenance,  pest  control,  and  labor  will  be  financed  by  QNBG  under  the  Project.  GEF \nfinancing will support the conservation forestry programs.  \n \n21.   The Project will also develop at least five endangered species management programs \nthat will operate within and beyond nature reserve boundaries. Support will be provided to \nintegrate the management of SARC under QNBG. The SARC division of QNBG, in cooperation \nwith the SFB, will implement the endangered species recovery plans. The objectives of the \nplans are to (i) remove the target species from the endangered list,10 and (ii) progressively lower \nthe threat level from endangered to threatened. For example, the crested ibis foraging habitat in \nwetlands and rice fields would have to be restored in the project area and maintained to enable \nthe eventual release of captive birds into the wild. The integration will be developed through \nshared research, joint planning exercises, and sharing of data and experiences for controlled \nrelease programs. The demonstration model framework will be replicated in other parts of the \n                                                 \n9  Funds can be allocated for the following activities: (i) habitat development, 40% ($160,000); (ii) monitoring, 25% \n($100,000);  (iii)  livelihood  improvement,  25%  ($100,000);  and  (iv)  implementation  of  endangered  species \nmanagement plans, 10% ($40,000). As the revenue increases, the funds allocated to wider livelihood and \nconservation programs will increase, including support for the Qinling Mountains, such as grants for residents to \nwork in conservation and livelihood enterprises. \n10 The criteria for delisting species from the endangered species list include (i) decline of a population by less than \n20% over the last 20 years, (ii) a population of more than 10,000, and (iii) less than 20% probability of extinction in \nthe next 100 years. \n ", "  7\nprovince, as well as in other provinces in the PRC. The endangered species management \nprogram will use the project area as a field conservation research area from which monitoring \ncan be carried out and lessons can be disseminated throughout the Qinling Mountains. \n \n22.  Improved  Village  and  Forest-Based  Livelihoods.  The  Project  will  support  the \ndevelopment of about 5,000 ha of conservation forestry and agriculture on collective forest land \nin the mountainous area in cooperation with local inhabitants on a voluntary basis. This will be \nachieved through the provision of technical support, planting materials, and site management \ntechnologies, including shade planting to enhance light penetration and intercropping. Local \ninhabitants operate and manage the collective forest land after being granted long-term land- \nuse  rights.  Local  residents  will  receive  support  for  the  development  of  nurseries,  land \npreparation,  and  planting  and  tree  maintenance  costs.  Inhabitants  in  QBCDA  will  be \ncompensated for any losses incurred in replacing subsistence farming with more sustainable \nand  environment-friendly  forest  and  income-enhancing  activities.  QNBG  will  assist  local \ninhabitants with livelihood improvements that will encourage the replacement of unsustainable \nactivities.11 Mixed flora species that mature into natural forests will generate substantial benefits, \nincluding reduced soil and water loss, and forest and non-forest products. To help increase rural \nincomes, valuable medicinal plants and trees will also be promoted on a household scale. The \nProject  will  support  forest-based  production  systems  to  enable  policy  reforms  and  future \nreplication of successful models. The village development plans will identify collective forest \nlands that will be surveyed and demarcated. The SFB, along with Zhouzhi County and village \nleaders, will issue forest-user rights contracts to all households. During the planning process, \nvillage forestry associations will be formed through which the conservation forestry program will \nbe  implemented.  The  Project  will  introduce  environmentally  compatible  rural  technologies, \ninfrastructure, and business practices for villagers that choose to shift into forest management \nand ecotourism livelihoods. This will enable local residents to remain in QBCDA in a manner \nthat supports the forest conservation and biodiversity objectives. All 16 village communities in \nthe area have expressed support for the Project.  \n \n23.   QNBG will upgrade community infrastructure, including up to about 17.5 km of roads \nalong the Tianyu River and about 100 km of mountain pathways, to reduce travel time and \nensure access during bad weather. QNBG will also promote home-stays and other income-\ngenerating activities, which will directly benefit residents. This activity will be modeled after the \nsuccessful  WWF-supported  home-stays  and  income-generating  activities  in  several  nature \nreserves in the Qinling Mountains. Training and technical advice will be provided to farmers to \nencourage them to adopt these eco-friendly activities. QBCDA communities will also access \nproject  funds  on  a  grant  basis  for  small  home-based  business  development,  including \nsustainable forest production systems and other benign activities, such as beekeeping, and \nessential oil and medicinal plant production. Support will be provided for market research to \nensure viability and links to local value chains. Grants will also be available for villages and all \nhouseholds to develop alternative energy sources (biogas and solar), and water supply and \nsanitation schemes where these are identified during the village development plans. \n \n2.  Enhanced Biodiversity Conservation in the Plains Area \n \n24.  This component will support QNBG, a public sector enterprise, in enhancing biodiversity \nconservation through the development of botanical gardens, and rehabilitation of the animal  \n \n                                                 \n11 QNBG, in consultation with community leaders, will provide small income-generating grants to the households in \nthe Qinling Biological Conservation Demonstration Area (QBCDA) (totaling about 1,000 households) for such \nbusiness activities as beekeeping, poultry raising, handicraft making, establishment of small restaurants, and \nproduction of biogas digesters. The grants will not exceed CNY25,000 per household. \n ", "8   \nrescue center.12 QNBG will manage all operations in the project area, including biodiversity \nconservation in QBCDA. Through QNBG, the Project will (i) enhance public awareness of \nbiodiversity conservation; (ii) create off-farm jobs, especially for the poor population residing in \nand around the project area; (iii) expand and diversify the ecotourism industry in Shaanxi \nprovince; (iv) transfer a portion of QNBG\u2019s revenues to support biodiversity conservation and \nalternative  livelihood  development  activities  in  QBCDA;  and  (v)  support  QBCDA  activities \nthrough research and technological assistance. \n \n25.  The Shaanxi provincial government (SPG) has proposed a long-term plan for the project \narea, with ADB and GEF providing finance during 2010\u20132015. The SPG and the private sector \nwould provide financing for a longer second phase of gradual expansion, based on lessons \nlearned from the Project, to the wider Qinling Mountains. The Project is designed to (i) formulate \na long-term plan for the project area based on the successful models that will be demonstrated; \n(ii) reach an agreement with villages on land uses and forest management practices that will \nensure forest conservation and biodiversity; and (iii) establish sustainable levels of financing \nfrom  the  SPG,  ecotourism,  and  forest  management  enterprises.  This  would  allow  for  (i) \nexpansion of infrastructure for ecotourism in the project area, (ii) preparation of plans to improve \nbiodiversity  conservation  in  the  other  nature  reserves  and  forest  reserves  in  the  Qinling \nMountains, and (iii) incorporation of lessons learned from the Project. The Project will undertake \nconstruction of essential infrastructure, including internal site roads, drainage system, water \nsupply,  animal  exposition  and  display  areas,  animal  enclosures,  lighting,  water  supply \ninvestments, and integrating Taoist features into cultural developments with QNBG. \n \n26.  Botanical  Gardens.  QNBG\u2019s  botanical  gardens  will  consist  of  gardens  linked  by \nwalkways.  Public  education  and  awareness  displays  along  these  walkways  will  provide \ninformation on themes such as natural history, environment, and biodiversity. QNBG will also \nconstruct a major exhibition hall to represent aspects of natural history and a service reception \ncenter. The 18 contiguous botanical gardens and other infrastructure will cover about 269 ha. \nThe gardens will also be linked by walkways and a cable car to a series of Taoist and Buddhist \ncultural sites that will be restored or recreated.13 Taoism, Buddhism, and local culture and \nhistory will be displayed along the entrances to these sites. \n \n27.   Revenues will be generated from day visitors and the use of entry tickets along with \nprofits from attractions or services, including the cable car, restaurants, rental cars, temple sites, \nand an exhibition hall. The number of visitors to the gardens alone is expected to rise from \n350,000 in 2011 to about 478,000 on project completion to more than 1.2 million in 2020. \nForecasts indicate that revenue will increase from about CNY30 million to about CNY65 million \nin 2015 and about CNY158 million in 2035. Employment will increase from the current 40 to \nmore than 250 staff by project completion; as the number of visitors grows, employment could \nreach about 600. \n \n28.   Animal Rescue Center. QNBG\u2019s SARC operates from a 141-ha site within the LFF. The \nmain rescue center is a 6-ha area for animal pens for public viewing. The site is in disrepair and \nfacing significant animal welfare issues. The center attracts about 30,000 visitors per year. The \nProject will significantly expand SARC to reposition it as a center of excellence operating at \n                                                 \n12 The Shaanxi provincial government established QNBG in August 2007, as an amalgamation of the Shaanxi Qinling \nBotanical Garden, Shaanxi Animal Rescue Center, and the Louguantai Forest Farm, to facilitate the management \nand financing of improvements in QBCDA. QNBG will be under the supervision of the Shaanxi Forest Bureau. \nQNBG is fully operational and has three divisions: Botanical Garden, Shaanxi Animal Rescue Center, and QBCDA. \n13 QNBG and the Louguantai Taoist Temple will jointly undertake the restoration program. The temple will assist in \nthe identification of legitimate sites and design specifications. The temple will be required to ratify the final designs \nto the project management office before any ADB approval for the financing of these sites. This approval will \ninclude design and operational parameters, including the sharing of revenue. \n ", "  9\ninternational  standards  in  the  management,  display,  and  gradual  release  of  threatened \nindigenous species. The Project will modernize the center by (i) increasing the personnel and \ntheir capacity in wildlife conservation; (ii) achieving more efficient rescue of wild, endangered \nanimals and their gradual rehabilitation and release; (iii) developing a high-quality tourism site; \n(iv) increasing the quantity and quality of research into wildlife; and (v) creating an awareness \nand education program for visitors and local communities on wildlife and biodiversity. The \nProject will entail an increase in the area from 141 ha to 1,008 ha. The enlargement will include \nthe  development  of  satellite  sites  in  more  natural  environments  for  the  major  endangered \nspecies\u2014giant panda, crested ibis, and golden snub-nosed monkey. \n \n29.   At project completion, SARC will have about 70% of the forage area developed and will \nbe able to support about 80% of total planned numbers of iconic species. As numbers and the \nscience allow, SARC will undertake the controlled release of species from breeding centers. \nThe Giant Panda Breeding and Research Center will be expanded to include 10 nursery rooms, \n32 enclosures, a reception and display area, and a research and feed-growing area. The \nCrested Ibis Center will include the construction of a 140,000-square meter facility comprising \nan artificial wetland on which a large flight aviary will be constructed to enable nesting colonies \nto be established. The Golden Monkey Center will involve about 10 ha of forested land that will \nsupport about 30 animals. The number of visitors is projected to increase to about 430,000 by \nproject completion in 2013, and then increase to more than 1 million in 2030. Revenue will \nincrease to about CNY33.3 million by project completion, CNY63 million by 2015, and CNY130 \nmillion in 2035. SARC management will contract a commercial tourism operator. Current staff \nlevels of 28 full-time jobs will increase to 200 full-time jobs by 2013. \n \n3.  Improved Project Management \n \n30.  The component will comprise (i) strengthening the project management office (PMO) \nand IA, (ii) institutional strengthening, and (iii) a conservation replication and dissemination \nprogram.  Successful  practices  in  biodiversity  conservation  and  habitat  restoration  with \ncommunity  participation  and  livelihood  development  will  be  analyzed  and  documented  for \nreplication in the Qinling Mountains.  \n \n31.   Strengthened Project Management Office and Implementing Agency. The Project \nwill be implemented through a PMO that will support QNBG in coordinating implementation. The \nPMO will be supported with 11 newly recruited staff supplied and financed by the Shaanxi \nDepartment of Finance, the Provincial Development and Reform Commission, and the SFB. \nThe  Project  will  finance  staff,  office  facilities,  field  monitoring  equipment,  project  impact \n(including resettlement monitoring), and training. Fifteen professional job exchanges for up to 2 \nmonths are allocated\u201410 to staff of QNBG, the IA; 5 to staff of the SPG, the Executing Agency \n(EA) staff. Project procurement will be undertaken by the IA and will be administered by a local \ncompany contracted by the PMO. \n \n32.   Strengthened  Biodiversity  Safeguards.  The  Project  will  develop  options  for \nsustainable  management  and  development  to  safeguard  and  mainstream  biodiversity.  The \nProject will review policies and regulations, and develop recommendations for the Government \non  (i)  collective  forest  land  tenure  and  management,  and  (ii)  ecotourism  guidelines  and \nstandards.  The  studies  will  be  contracted  to  reputable  research  institutions  with  a  strong \nknowledge of the subject matters. QNBG will ensure that the recommendations of the studies \nare implemented to strengthen biodiversity conservation. \n \n33.   Conservation  Dissemination  Program.  The  Project  will  undertake  a  series  of \nparticipatory dissemination programs involving biodiversity experts from the Qinling Mountains, \nusing  the  project  area  as  a  basis  for  developing  and  testing  approaches  to  biodiversity \n ", "10   \nconservation. The SFB, with earlier support from WWF, has made important gains in landscape \napproaches to management of nature reserves, and in linking corridors with remaining forest \nand farm lands. Support will be provided to further define and test landscape planning and \nconservation management models for the Qinling Mountains. The models will be evaluated and \nthen used to prepare landscape management guidelines for the Qinling Mountains. Participants \nwill form a professional communication network to build a stronger professional cadre. The \nProject will assist stakeholders in developing an ecotourism master plan that can guide QNBG\u2019s \ninvestment program.  \n \n34.   Support will be provided for (i) the development of a data collection system, including \nprocurement  of  field  monitoring  equipment  (such  as  camera  traps  and  global  positioning \nsystems); (ii) data collection and interpretation of imagery; (iii) training for existing QNBG staff to \nenable them to form a field monitoring team; (iv) monitoring of biodiversity and habitats using \ngeographic  information  system  application  of  data;  and  (v)  dissemination  of  this  data  and \nanalysis  throughout  the  Qinling  Mountains.  The  dissemination  program  will  include  the \ncommunication  of  data,  analysis,  and  lessons  learned  from  the  Project  to  a  wide  set  of \nstakeholders within the Qinling Mountains. WWF may be considered for this activity because of \nits extensive monitoring program in the Qinling Mountains and its close association with the \nSFB. The baseline will be formed through a series of contracted field survey and research \nstudies  involving  (i)  vegetation,  (ii)  vertebrates,  (iii)  invertebrates,  (iv)  fish  and  aquatic \nbiodiversity, (v) amphibians, and (vi) soil microbial organisms.  \n \nC.  Activities Financed by the Global Environment Facility  \n \n35.   The GEF will provide $5 million to the Project. After deductions to recover the project \npreparation costs and a 10% management fee, the net GEF investment funds available to the \nProject will be $4.27 million. GEF funds will be used for the components that are directly related \nto strengthening the conservation of biodiversity in the project area and the Qinling Mountains. \nThe approach to using the GEF funds emphasizes the development of communication and \nshared information and lessons through (i) wider participation in conservation planning and \ndecision making; (ii) the demonstration of new management systems related to landscape-wide \nplanning; (iii) the development of species management plans in the Qinling Mountains; (iv) the \nadoption of new technologies, including monitoring and information systems; (v) the use of \nanalog forestry models; and (vi) the development of ecologically defined habitat restoration \nprograms. The GEF support will also help test innovative models for scaling up in other parts of \nthe Qinling Mountains and the PRC. \n \n36.   For assisting biodiversity management in the mountainous area (output 1), GEF and \nloan  funds  will  support  the  demonstration  of  biodiversity  conservation  (subcomponent  1), \nincluding (i) the preparation of a habitat and natural forest management plan; (ii) ecological \nresearch grants to develop the data sets and to test silviculture systems for habitat restoration; \n(iii) technical assistance in conservation forestry to support the habitat restoration programs; \nand (iv) programs for endangered species recovery, including field survey contracts, species \nrecovery management plans, and initial implementation of recovery implementation programs. \nTo assist project management (output 3), GEF funding will support (i) legal reform studies, (ii) \nlandscape conservation planning, (iii) field conservation monitoring, (iv) technical assistance for \nspecies and monitoring expertise, (v) monitoring baseline research contracts, (vi) job exchange \nopportunities for technical conservation staff, and (vii) a replication and awareness program. \n \nD.  Special Features \n \n37.   An important feature of the Project is the demonstration of biodiversity conservation in a \nsmaller and focused area, and its link to other Qinling Mountains conservation programs. The \nlink  includes  a  review  of  conservation  priorities  and  plans  for  the  Qinling  Mountains;  the \n ", "  11\ndemonstration  of  new  technologies  and  practices;  and  the  sharing  of  information  and \nopportunities for research, monitoring, and management. The institutional and organizational \nreforms in the project area mirror the major challenges to improving management in the wider \nQinling Mountains. The vast array of scattered and often overlapping organizational interests \nhave resulted in competitive behavior, lack of cooperation, resources wastage, and the dilution \nof skills in short supply. The consolidation of various agencies into one management entity for \nbiodiversity  conservation  represents  a  significant  achievement  that  could  be  replicated \nthroughout the PRC and internationally. \n \n38.  Another innovation is the demonstration model for financial sustainability of biodiversity \nconservation. The SPG has embarked on an ambitious program to use protected areas to \ngenerate revenue to help cover its costs for conservation establishment and management. In \nthis case, QNBG will respond to customer demand for rare animal experiences, and will expand \nthe market of natural attractions, such as the botanical garden, the animal center, the birthplace \nof the Taoist religion, and the remarkable landscape. The proposed model for transferring \nfinancial resources to the wider biodiversity conservation program will provide a sustainable \nfinancing mechanism that will not depend on continued donor or government support. The \ndevelopment of QNBG offers world-class and highly-demanded ecotourism opportunities linked \nto globally-iconic species. SARC will be developed as a world-class center for the care and \nwelfare of animals, and will be the conduit for expanding animal biodiversity throughout the \nproject area. The project area\u2019s proximity to Xi'an and the mass tourism market provide a good \nopportunity to establish links to the Shaanxi tourism market chain. The potential benefits from \necotourism are also expected to help reduce poverty in the project area. \n \nE.  Project Investment Plan  \n \n39.  The Project is estimated to cost $132.64 million, including taxes and duties of $5.65 \nmillion. The investment plan is in Table 1 and details are in Appendix 5. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.  Base Costb    \n  1.

Financing Plan \n \n40.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $40  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to finance about 30.2% of the project cost. The loan will have a 25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility for US dollar loans, a commitment \ncharge of about 0.15% per year on undisbursed funds, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the loan and project agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The GEF grant of \n$4.27 million will finance about 3.2% of the project cost. The remaining $88.37 million (66.6%) \nwill be contributed by the SPG as counterpart funds or from IA revenues. The financing plan is \nsummarized in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \nSource  Total    % \nAsian Development Bank  40.00    30.2 \nGlobal Environment Facility   4.27    3.2 \nGovernment  88.37    66.6 \n    Total  132.64    100.0 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n41.  The Borrower is the PRC, which will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to the SPG for \nonlending to the IA on the same terms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. The flow of \nfunds and onlending arrangements are shown in Appendix 6. The Chinese Academy for the \nAdvancement of Science, the SPG, and State Forestry Administration each will provide about \n28.5% of the counterpart funds for QNBG, while the remaining 14.5% will be provided by the \nXi'an municipal government. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n42.  The SPG will be the EA responsible for overall implementation of the Project. The SPG \nwill coordinate activities with the Shaanxi Provincial Finance Department and the SFB. The SPG \nhas formed a project leading group, chaired by a vice governor with representatives from the \nProvincial Development and Reform Commission, the Shaanxi Provincial Finance Department, \nSFB, the Shaanxi Audit Department, the Shaanxi Tourism Bureau, and the Xi'an municipal \ngovernment. The project leading group will provide policy advice and approve annual work \nplans. The SPG has also formed a PMO through the Provincial Development and Reform \nCommission which, upon project approval, will be provided with 11 full-time staff members. The \norganizational  chart  is  in  Appendix  7.  The  PMO  will  support  project  implementation  by \ncontracting a procurement agency to undertake the project procurement program on a fee-for-\nservice basis. The SPG has successfully used this approach previously for ADB and World \nBank  projects.  The  PMO\u2019s  major  tasks  and  responsibilities  include  (i)  overseeing  all \nimplementation matters; (ii) preparing annual work plans and budgets in consultation with the \nEA and IA; (iii) supervising procurement according to ADB guidelines; (iv) maintaining project \naccounts; (v) preparing and submitting to ADB applications for loan and grant fund withdrawals; \n(vi) monitoring physical and financial progress, including benefits and costs to beneficiaries; and \n(vii) ensuring adequate and timely counterpart financing. \n \n ", "  13\n43.  QNBG will be the IA for all components and activities. Its three divisions for the botanical \ngardens, SARC, and QBCDA will be responsible for (i) habitat restoration and reforestation; (ii) \nprocurement and provision of inputs for construction and habitat restoration; (iii) preparation of \nvillage  development,  habitat  restoration,  endangered  species,  and  landscape  management \nplans  in  a  participatory  manner  with  local  inhabitants;  (iv)  construction,  operation,  and \nmaintenance of the botanical gardens and SARC; (v) training of QNBG staff and QBCDA \ninhabitants  in  biodiversity  conservation,  forest  management,  project  implementation,  and \nfinancial management; and (vi) close consultation with the Louguantai Daoist Temple on all \ndesign  and  implementation  aspects  of  reconstruction,  and  improvements  of  religious  and \nhistorical relics and buildings. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n44.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years  from  April  2010  to  April  2015.  The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n45.  All  procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Contracts for goods estimated \nto  exceed  $1.0  million  and  contracts  for  works  estimated  to  exceed  $10.0  million  will  be \nprocured using international competitive bidding procedures. Contracts for goods and works \nestimated  to  cost  less  than  the  international  competitive  bidding  values,  but  more  than \n$100,000, will be procured through national competitive bidding procedures in accordance with \nthe PRC Tendering and Bidding Law, 1999, subject to modifications agreed upon with ADB. \nContracts for goods and works estimated to cost $100,000 or less shall be procured using \nshopping procedures. Details are in Appendix 9. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement documents and contracts. \nIn  accordance  with  ADB  procedures,  an  assessment  has  been  made  of  the  procurement \ncapacity of the SPG and other project agencies. The assessment concludes that the SPG and \nQNBG have adequate procurement experience in domestically- and ADB-financed projects. \nHowever,  their  staffs  will  need  training  on  financial  management,  and  ADB  procurement \nprocedures and requirements to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. For \nthis purpose, SPG and QNBG staff will be nominated to attend ADB-sponsored courses and \nseminars on procurement and project implementation. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n46.  Consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The Project will provide 84 person-months of consulting \nservices,  comprising  15  person-months  of  international  experts  and  69  person-months  of \nnational experts. These services will be procured in two packages. For package A, which will be \nfinanced under the GEF grant, QNBG\u2019s SARC division will select and engage six individual \nconsultants for 1 month each\u2014one international and one national expert for each of the giant \npanda, crested ibis, and golden monkey habitats and plans for effective conservation. For \npackage B, which will also be financed under the GEF grant, the PMO will select and engage a \nconsulting firm using the quality- and cost-based selection method (80:20) and the full technical \nproposal procedures. The consulting firm will provide expertise in biodiversity conservation, \nspecies  recovery  management,  ecotourism  planning,  village  development  planning,  animal \nexposition and breeding, wildlife veterinary services, species recovery and survey, conservation \nforestry, and geographic information systems. The terms of reference for consulting services are \nin Appendix 10. \n ", "14   \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n47.  The  Government  requested  retroactive  financing  for  procurement  and  construction \nactivities during 2009. The detail of activities to be procured and financed will be set out in a \nwritten request to ADB. The Government was advised that retroactive financing could only apply \nto up to 20% of the ADB loan for expenditures incurred prior to loan effectiveness but not earlier \nthan 12 months before the signing of the Loan Agreement. All contracts proposed for advanced \naction and retroactive financing will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n48.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with QNBG and SPG. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding \ndocuments for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB and GEF in connection \nwith the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of the QNBG, SPG, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice  providers  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  The  project  design  and  implementation \narrangements  provide  for  mitigating  corruption  risks.  Risks  associated  with  project \nmanagement, including procurement and disbursement, will be mitigated by (i) engaging an \ninternational consultant and a national consultant to advise and assist in the procurement of \ngoods and services, and the engagement of other consultants; (ii) introducing a dual signing \nsystem in which the civil works contractor awarded the contract will also sign an anticorruption \ncontract with the employer; and (iii) the PMO periodically inspecting the contractor\u2019s activities \nrelated to fund withdrawals and settlements. The SPG will ensure that the PMO establishes \nfinancial control and management arrangements in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2005)  and  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n49.  The  proceeds  of  the  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. To facilitate project implementation and the flow of funds, an imprest \naccount will be set up in a commercial bank acceptable to ADB upon loan effectiveness; a \nseparate imprest account will be opened for the GEF grant funds. The SPG\u2019s Department of \nFinance will manage both accounts. The initial advance to be deposited to the loan imprest \naccount will not exceed either 6 months of estimated expenditures to be financed from an \nimprest account or about 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The initial advance to be \ndeposited  to  the  grant  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  either  6  months  of  estimated \nexpenditures to be financed from an imprest account or 20% of the grant amount, whichever is \nlower. The direct payment procedures will apply for the large contracts. If the SPG initially funds \neligible expenditures from its own resources, the reimbursement procedure will be used. To \nexpedite funds flow and simplify the documentation process, the statement of expenditures \n(SOE)  procedure  will  be  used  for  liquidation  and  replenishment  of  imprest  accounts  and \nreimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $100,000  per  individual  payment. \nPayments exceeding the SOE ceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, or replenished based on full \nsupporting documentation. A financial management assessment of the SPG and QNBG was \nconducted (Supplementary Appendix D). The assessment concludes that they satisfy ADB\u2019s \n ", "  15\nfinancial  management  requirements,  and  that  they  have  satisfactory  financial  management \ncapability. The PMO will provide training on project and financial management. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n50.  All agencies involved in project implementation will maintain records and accounts that \nidentify  goods  and  services  from  loan  proceeds  and  the  GEF  grant,  financing  resources \nreceived, expenditures incurred, and use of local funds. These accounts will be established and \nmaintained  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles  and  internationally-accepted \naccounting standards. The PMO will review and consolidate these accounts, and have them \naudited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  practices  by  externally  appointed \nauditors of the Government or other auditors acceptable to ADB. The audit report will include a \nstatement verifying whether the funds disbursed by ADB were used for the purposes for which \nthey were provided, as well as the separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest account \nand SOE procedures. Copies of the audited accounts and auditor\u2019s report will be submitted to \nADB within 6 months of the end of each financial year. The PMO will prepare consolidated \nsemi-annual reports indicating progress made, problems encountered during the period, steps \ntaken  or  proposed  to  remedy  the  problems,  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  progress \nexpected for the following 6 months. In addition, SPG will provide to ADB a brief report 3 \nmonths prior to each semi-annual report summarizing contract awards, disbursements, and \nphysical progress to cover the 3 months under review. The loan and GEF grant will be covered \nin these reports. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the PMO will submit to \nADB a completion report that describes the achievements in relation to the Project\u2019s expected \nimpact, outcome, and outputs. QNBG will have its accounts audited and its financial statements \nprepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards by auditors acceptable to \nADB.  \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n51.  To monitor the progress of the Project in achieving the planned outcome and outputs, \nthe PMO will establish and maintain a project performance monitoring system (PPMS), which \nwill be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action regarding project design, \nschedules, activities, and development impacts. The PPMS will adopt the following agreed-upon \nindicators:  (i)  project  progress,  (ii)  enabling  framework  improvements  (policies  and  legal \nharmonization  and  clear  institutional  mandates),  (iii)  results  of  capacity  development,  (iv) \nprogress towards demonstration and pilot targets using participatory procedures, (v) beneficiary \nimpacts, (vi) related improvement to the sustainable financing of field conservation, and (vii) \nADB safeguards compliance. At project inception, the PMO, in consultation with QNBG and with \nthe  assistance  of  the  consultants,  will  develop  comprehensive  PPMS  procedures  to \nsystematically  generate  data  on  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  project  activities;  and  the \nsocioeconomic,  health,  and  environmental  indicators  to  measure  project  impacts.  This  will \ninclude individual and consolidated work plans, which, once approved, will form the basis for \nassessing progress and achievements. The PMO will refine the PPMS framework, confirm \nachievable targets, firm up monitoring and recording arrangements, and establish systems and \nprocedures no later than 6 months after loan effectiveness. QNBG will report baseline and \nprogress data at the requisite time intervals to the PMO, including resettlement monitoring \nresults and reporting on environmental management. The PMO will be responsible for analyzing \nand  consolidating  the  reported  data  through  its  management  information  system,  and  for \nreporting the outcome to ADB through quarterly progress reports. \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n52.  In  addition  to  regular  monitoring,  ADB  and  SPG  will  jointly  review  the  project \nperformance  at  least  once  a  year.  The  review  will  assess  implementation,  and  financial \n ", "16   \nperformance and progress towards achieving project outcome and outputs. It will also identify \nissues and constraints affecting implementation, and work out a time-bound action plan for their \nresolution. ADB and SPG will undertake a midterm review before the end of the third year to \nassess implementation status and take appropriate measures, including modifying the scope \nand implementation arrangements, and reallocating loan and grant proceeds, as appropriate, to \nachieve the Project\u2019s impact and outcome. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n53.  The population of some of the endangered species has declined rapidly. Under the \nProject, this population will slowly regenerate, expanding in numbers and coverage area. The \narea experiencing soil degradation and erosion will be reduced through forest expansion and \nbetter management. The Project seeks to achieve these objectives by including local villagers in \nthe improvement and management of forest lands. The residents in QBCDA will be provided \nwith user and management rights for 70 years. Further, they will receive grants and technical \nassistance to (i) establish analog forest systems, (ii) develop local value-adding industries for \nforest-derived products, (iii) establish home-stays, (iv) introduce alternate energy and water \nsupplies, and (v) improve access by upgrading the Tianyu River road and a network of mountain \npathways. The Project will substantially increase the production of non-forest products. An \nestimated  100  permanent  jobs  for  the  home-stays,  about  100  jobs  for  the  home-based \nbusinesses, and about 200 jobs for maintaining the conservation forest program on state land \nwill be generated. \n \n54.  In the project area, the plains area has been earmarked for revenue-generating activities \nbased on QNBG and the existing Taoist cultural sites. QNBG will generate resources that will be \ntransferred for investment into the sustainable biodiversity management within QBCDA and the \nQinling Mountains. QNBG will generate a significant number of jobs for local residents in the \nproject area and the surrounding fringe areas. Revenue-generating activities will be planned \nwith  safeguards  to  ensure  that  environmental  pollution  is  managed,  including  solid  waste, \nwastewater,  and  noise  and  air  pollution.  About  10,000  jobs  will  be  created  during  the \nconstruction phase, and an additional 870 permanent jobs will generated within the related \nagencies. These jobs will be awarded to local inhabitants wherever possible. The quality of life \nfor local inhabitants will be improved through access to safe drinking water, better sanitation and \nwastewater treatment, and biogas systems. \n   \nB.  Financial Analyses \n \n55.   Financial analyses were carried out for the botanical gardens, SARC, and the home-stay \nactivities  in  QBCDA.  The  home-based  businesses  and  the  conservation  forestry  livelihood \nactivities were not financially assessed because (i) the exact nature of the small businesses and \ntheir scale are uncertain, and (ii) the high proportion of public good benefits linked to habitats \nand improved ecological services is long term in nature. The botanical gardens, SARC, and \nhome-stays display financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) both before and after tax that \nexceed the weighted average cost of capital. QNBG may lack liquidity during the construction \nperiod, and the Government has agreed to underwrite this working capital requirement of QNBG \nduring this period. The before-tax FIRR for QNBG is 9.5%, while the post-tax FIRR is 8% \n(Appendix 11). An FIRR was not calculated for the Project as a whole. \n \nC.  Economic Benefits \n \n56.   Economic analyses were undertaken for the botanical gardens, SARC, home-stays, and \nthe Project as a whole. The quantified benefit stream was limited to the visitor and revenue data \n ", "  17\nfor each, and did not include the contribution to global species management, genetic collections \nfor  biodiversity,  cultural  and  religious  values,  and  scientific  contribution  to  biodiversity \nconservation.  Major  non-quantified  benefits  include  (i)  payment  for  the  establishment  of \nconservation forestry on about 7,000 ha in the mountainous area that will provide increased \njobs; (ii) shorter travel time because of better road and mountain pathway access; (iii) higher \neconomic output derived from alternative livelihoods through the provision of about 40 small \nbusiness development grants, about 10 home-stays, and about 100 household biogas systems; \nand (iv) better health from improvements in access to water, alternative sources of energy, and \nreduced fuelwood cutting. No economic benefits were quantified for the impacts and benefits \narising from the profit redistribution to the QBCDA program. The economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) for QNBG including SARC is 13.7%. The EIRR for the home-stay activity is 23.4%. No \nEIRR was calculated for biodiversity management in the mountainous area (output 1) because \nof the public good nature and uncertainty attached to the quantification of benefits. The benefits \nare substantial in terms of potential livelihood and environmental improvements in QBCDA and \nthe wider Qinling Mountains. The quantified EIRR for the total project is 10.9% however, there \nare additional substantial nonquantifiable environmental and other benefits (Appendix 11). \n \nD.  Environmental Benefits and Impacts \n \n57.   The Project is classified as category B, according to ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). A \nsummary  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  has  been  prepared,  including  an \nenvironmental  management  plan  and  environmental  monitoring  plan  (Appendix  12).  The \nmajority of the project impacts are environmentally beneficial, including improvements to long-\nterm  biodiversity  conservation  and  sustainability  in  the  Qinling  Mountains.  The  major \nenvironmental benefits include (i) improvement in the welfare of animals in SARC and QBCDA; \n(ii) advancement of science on endangered species recovery from SARC; (iii) the genetic \ncollection established at QNBG; (iv) public awareness and education regarding the Qinling \nMountains  and  biodiversity  conservation;  (v)  overall  conservation  of  biodiversity;  (vi) \nimprovement in ecological functions in QBCDA from more and higher-quality forest cover; (vii) \nintangible  benefits  arising  from  the  conservation  of  Taoist  religious  sites;  and  (viii)  better \nenvironmental quality through the provision of better sanitation, wastewater, and management \nsystems. Some adverse impacts may also occur, including (i) the introduction of nonnative \nplants into the botanical garden with the potential to become invasive species; and (ii) the \ngradual release of faunal species, such as the giant panda and the crested ibis, in the wild. The \npotential impacts have been assessed, and these will be mitigated to acceptable levels.  \n \nE.  Poverty Impact and Employment \n \n58.   The incidence of poverty is over 70% in QBCDA, compared with 23% in the plains area, \nwhere most of the people live. Poverty in QBCDA is highlighted by low grain availability per \ncapita of only 198 kilograms compared with 422 kilograms in the plains area. A survey found \nthat QBCDA\u2019s income per capita was about CNY600 in 2007, only 18% of the national average \nand 27% of Shaanxi\u2019s rural population average. The livelihood survey conducted under the \ntechnical assistance14 found that the stakeholders had extremely limited human capital, as \nreflected in the poor education levels among adults. The habitation in QBCDA are scattered (12 \npersons per km2 compared with 267 per km2 elsewhere in the project area) because of the \nmountainous and isolated conditions. Physical capital has improved with the road upgrading \nalong  the  Tianyu  River,  but  other  infrastructure  is  virtually  nonexistent  because  the  local \ngovernment had encouraged people to move out of the mountains. Access to formal banking \nservices is limited because of the lack of security, deposits, and access to banks. Many of the \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Dryland Farming in the \nNorthern Region Project. Manila (TA 4631-PRC). \n ", "18   \nQBCDA residents depend on subsidy payments from government programs. Households in the \nplains area are better off as they have access to physical infrastructure, especially roads; health \nand education services; more opportunities for off-farm employment; and access to productive \nland and markets for high-value crops, including kiwi fruit. A summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 13. About 1,200 households in QBCDA will receive benefits from \n(i) employment, (ii) opportunities to start small businesses, (iii) forest-use rights with supporting \nconservation forest plantings, and (iv) better access to water supplies and alternative energy \nsources. About 10,000 jobs will be created during project construction, with an additional 870 \ndirectly  employed  full  time.  Benefits  will  arise  from  more  ecotourism  and  economic \ndevelopment. The shift into forest-based livelihoods will provide long-term benefits.  \n \nF.  Gender and Development \n \n59.  Gender  roles  are  determined  by  a  combination  of  cultural  factors,  environmental \nconditions, education levels, and jobs. In the project area, income inequities create incentives \nfor rural workers to migrate to urban labor markets. However, because it is close to good roads \nand  to  county  towns,  female  laborers\u2014particularly  young  women\u2014share  the  available \nopportunities with men for off-farm jobs. Agricultural feminization is only slight in the developed \ncommercial and agricultural area. Young people in QBCDA tend to be mobile, and the group left \nbehind is older. In general, the Project will benefit women significantly and will not have an \nadverse impact on women or children. Women will benefit from the ecotourism facilities, and will \nhave greater access to information and jobs, and more opportunities for starting small income-\ngeneration  activities.  They  will  get  jobs  during  the  construction  of  QNBG.  As  part  of  the \nparticipation strategy, women will be prioritized for direct and indirect project benefits and for \nprotection against social risks. Special gender measures have been included in the resettlement \nplans. Gender-disaggregated indicators will be monitored in the PPMS. The Project will not \nhave significant negative impacts on women, and they will participate equally in project activities \nand  have  equal  opportunities  for  access  to  social  services,  training,  employment,  land \nrelocation, and beneficiary agreements. \n \nG.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n60.   A summary resettlement plan has been prepared (Appendix 14). For the construction of \nQNBG, 19.6 ha of land will be permanently acquired. The land acquisition will affect 115 \nhouseholds with 504 people. The houses of 143 households with 617 people totaling 19,319 \nsquare meters will be demolished, and these people will be relocated nearby in the same village \nof Dianzhen. QNBG  will pay compensation of about CNY28.9 million, including taxes and \nmanagement fees. QNBG will also lease the land-use rights for an additional 249.7 ha, affecting \nabout 3,780 people in 948 households (i.e., the entire village population). The village and the \nhouseholds will continue to own this land. QNBG will sign land-lease agreements with the \naffected groups of Dianzhen village to establish a 50-year land-use right for the botanical \ngardens. QNBG will make fixed annual payments to affected households for 50 years, plus \nannual  payments  based  on  gate  revenues  or  profit  when  the  botanical  garden  becomes \noperational. The improved village and forest-based livelihood improvement programs in QBCDA \nwill  be  implemented  with  the  16  villages  on  a  voluntary  basis.  No  adverse  impacts  are \nanticipated, but QNBG has assured the livelihoods of local inhabitants will be safeguarded.  \n \n61.   The upgrading and expansion of SARC will use an additional 1,008 ha of land, but most \nalready belong to LFF. Only 9 ha need to be acquired permanently from three villages for the \nconstruction of the Crested Ibis Center (2 ha), the Golden Monkey Center (3 ha), and the Giant \nPanda Breeding and Research Center (4 ha). The land acquisition will affect 30 households with \n125 people; 2.9 ha of land is dry farmland, 5.5 ha is sloped land, and 0.6 ha irrigated land. \nQNBG will pay compensation of CNY13.6 million to the affected villages.  \n ", "  19\nH.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n \n62.   Construction  delays  will  place  significant  pressure  on  the  cash  flow  of  QNBG. \nRecognizing this risk, the SPG has committed to underwrite the cash flow with counterpart \nfunds. Weak management and poor operation of the proposed investments will threaten the \nfinancial viability of QNBG, which is currently assessed as adequate but not strong. All of the \nagencies consolidated into QNBG, including the Shaanxi Qinling Botanical Garden, SARC, and \nthe  LFF,  have  many  years  of  biodiversity  project  experience.  QNBG  is  well  staffed  with \nexperienced and qualified personnel. The challenge for QNBG will be to work together to \neffectively manage all project activities related to habitat restoration, species regeneration, \nbotanical gardens, SARC, ecotourism, and income-generating activities for poor residents in the \nmountainous and plains areas. The SPG has agreed to strengthen QNBG with additional staff, \nstart-up  funds,  and  sufficient  staff  training.  QNBG  will  undergo  institutional  strengthening \nthrough the use of consulting services, as well as the recruitment of expert and experienced \nstaff in biodiversity conservation, ecotourism promotion, management, and engineering. The \nfinancial sustainability of QNBG and the Project will be ensured through the generation of \necotourism revenue sufficient to meet all projected operation and maintenance costs, plus the \nexpansion of biodiversity conservation activities in the Qinling Mountains. The design of the \nProject  has  factored  in  potential  risks  from  invasive  species  and  poor  animal  welfare  by \nintroducing  international  expertise  and  limiting  QNBG  to  plant  species  from  the  Qinling \nMountains. The risks of food supply shortages and price increases because of the resettlement \nof affected farmers in the plains area are considered minimal, even in local village markets. The \nrisks associated with agricultural or other encroachment on forest land are also considered \nminimal. QNBG is adequately staffed to enforce regulations regarding encroachment on forest \nland, and will employ local residents as forest monitors and ecotourism guides. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n63.   In addition to standard assurances, the Government, the SPG, and the IA have given the \nfollowing assurances that have been incorporated into the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Counterpart  financing.

The goal of the biodiversity program of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) is the \nconservation of biodiversity that provides its people a fair and equitable share of benefits from a \nbetter  utilization  of  generic  resources.  However,  increasing  population  pressures,  cultural \ntraditions, and economic development have degraded the PRC\u2019s biological resources. The large \npopulation combined with limited land and water resources have caused extensive loss of \nhabitats  to  meet  the  growing  needs  for  housing,  infrastructure,  farming,  logging,  fuelwood \ncollection,  and  livestock  grazing.  These  problems  are  also  characteristic  of  the  Qinling \nMountains. As a result, 804 species in the PRC are on the International Union for Conservation \nof Nature list of globally-threatened species. Of these, 442 are plants and 362 are animals. The \nPRC\u2019s own Red Data Book of threatened species includes a much larger total.  \n \nB.  Biodiversity Conservation \n \n2.  The project area and the Qinling Mountains have three types of protected areas: nature \nreserves, forest reserves, and ecological function conservation areas. The Qinling Mountains \nhas 27 nature reserves and forest reserves, and one ecological function conservation area. The \nnature reserves cover 557,298 hectares (ha) or nearly 10% of the total of 5 million ha. The \nShaanxi Forest Bureau, with support from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), planned and \nestablished  the  reserve  network  for  giant  pandas.  It  includes  five  well-established  nature \nreserves, nine recently-established nature reserves, five corridors, and five planned nature \nreserves. While the protected area system in the Qinling Mountains is excellent in its coverage \nof the upper elevations, the lower slopes that support forests and provide winter habitats for \nmany species, including the giant panda and the golden takin, have little protection.1 The \ndifficulty in protecting the lower slopes is that they have been settled and farmed for centuries. \nThe Project addresses the need to protect lower elevation habitats of the Qinling Mountains. \n \n3.  In March 2002, WWF launched its Qinling Giant Panda Project to protect the giant \npandas and their habitats in the Qinling Mountains. The Qinling panda population includes \nabout 300 pandas that are geographically and genetically isolated from other panda populations \nin Gansu and Sichuan provinces. Similar to the Asian Development Bank\u2013Global Environment \nFacility  (GEF)  project,  the  WWF  panda  project  seeks  balance  between  conservation  and \ndevelopment. WWF involves private sector investors to fund the development of new industries, \nactivities, and livelihoods for villagers to reduce or eliminate human-caused pressures on panda \nhabitats. WWF\u2019s panda project plans to achieve a 10% increase in the Qinling giant panda \npopulation by 2012, and a 20% increase in the area of protected panda habitats.  \n \n4.  The World Bank\u2013GEF China Nature Reserve Management Project began in 1995 and \nwas completed in 2002. The project focused on nature reserves of Poyang Lake in Jiangxi, \nShengnongjia in Hubei, Wuyi Mountain in Fujian, Xishuangbanna in Yunnan; nature reserves of \nChangqing, Foping, Niubeiliang, Taibaishan, and Zhouzhi in the Qinling Mountains, Shaanxi; \nand Wuyishan nature reserve in Jiangxi, and Changqing Forestry Bureau in Shaanxi. This \nproject drew on project experiences from other countries under the GEF pilot phase and from \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). The Project draws on the following related lessons from \n                                                 \n1  Li Diqiang, Song Yangling, and Ouyang Zhiyun. 2003.

Beijing:  China Land Press (in Chinese and English). \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \nthis project and ADB\u2019s 1991 Operations Evaluation Department\u2019s report on forestry:2 (i) the \nimportance of integrating the management of protected and unprotected natural forest areas \ninto regional forest management plans, (ii) the importance of developing restructuring programs \nfor inefficient state forestry enterprises, and (iii) the need to expand the protected area system \nand improve management technologies for forests with high biodiversity and environmental \nservices values. The community participation program supported under the Project incorporates \nlessons learned from several ongoing pilot activities in the PRC managed by NGOs and the \nGovernment, particularly (i) the importance of integrating local villagers into the assessment of \ncommunity needs through participatory rural appraisal techniques; and (ii) the need to establish \nclear, mutually-agreed contracts that identify the respective rights and responsibilities of nature \nreserve staff and local communities in resource use.  \n \n5.  The World Bank-financed Sustainable Forestry Development Project3 was approved in \n2002 and will be completed in 2009. It has three components: (i) plantation establishment, (ii) \nnatural  forests  management,  and  (iii)  protected  area  management.  GEF  and  Europe  Aid \nprovided cofinancing grants. Important lessons included the following: \n \n(i)  forestry needs to be fully integrated into land-use planning;  \n(ii)  successful management is only possible with a defined and enforced permanent \nforest area;  \n(iii)  decisions  on  forest  management  must  take  into  account  the  interests  of  all \nstakeholders; \n(iv)  all management options for forests, even total protection, have financial and \neconomic  costs;  the  options  selected  must  have  long-term  financial  and \neconomic sustainability;  \n(v)  alternative  resource  control  systems,  such  as  decentralization  and  co-\nmanagement with government agencies, local communities, the private sector, \nNGOs, and others, should be supported;  \n(vi)  effective policy analysis and development should be prioritized, because policy \nand market failures have been more serious than technical problems of forest \nmanagement, silviculture, and conservation;  \n(vii)  support  for  commercial  forestry  plantation  development  should  continue  to \nreduce pressure on natural forests and expand domestic wood supply; and \n(viii)  the GEF program should be expanded, because biodiversity resources warrant a \nlarger share of international support than is currently received. \n \nC.  Threats to Biodiversity Conservation \n \n6.  General threats to biodiversity in the Qinling Mountains were identified in 19984 as (i) \nintensive commercial timber harvesting near nature reserves, (ii) agricultural encroachment, (iii) \nillegal harvesting of natural resources, (iv) fragmentation of nature reserves by construction of \nnational highways and reduced potential for gene exchange, and (v) unregulated development \nof tourism. In 1998, logging was banned in natural forests nationwide. While this stopped \ncommercial logging (except in forest plantations), it did not regulate household use of timber for \nconstruction, cooking, and/or heating. Extensive household use of timber remains a threat to \nnature reserves nationwide, because villagers live within or near all nature reserves.

Farming on the steep slopes \ncaused soil erosion that washed away valuable soils and choked waterways. The Government \ninstituted the Sloping Land Conversion Program (or \u201cGrain for Green\u201d program) beginning in \n2000. The program provides grain, cash, and saplings to farmers who convert their steep \nsloping farmlands to grassland or woodland.5 The program has been implemented on 600,000\u2013\n800,000 ha in the Qinling Mountains. To counter the other threats, strategies were proposed to \n(i) establish co-management with villagers living in and around nature reserves; (ii) establish \nbiological corridors to counter the impacts of highways and railways; (iii) restrict illegal entry by \nvillagers and livestock, and blockage of wildlife movements by fences installed to protect natural \nforests; (iv) improve the management of ecotourism; and (v) diversify village enterprises. \n \n7.  Each of these strategies has been implemented to some extent. Co-management is \nnow standard operating procedure in Taibaishan and Foping nature reserves in the Qinling \nMountains, and seems to be working well. The impact of these co-management policies has \nbeen that the villagers now consider protection of nature reserves and natural resources not \nonly as their right and responsibility but also their most reliable means of achieving higher \nstandards  of  living.  Biological  corridors  have  been  established  in  part  by  an  aggressive \ncampaign by the Government and WWF to establish new nature reserves. Two significant \nissues appear to remain with respect to links between critical habitats. These are reforestation \nprojects of the 1950s and 1960s that involved two nonnative species of larch (Japanese Larch \nLarix kampfera and North China Larch Larix princi), which have grown in mono-species stands \nthat block natural colonization by other species. The result is large expanses of forest that lack \nunderstory vegetation and have little floristic diversity. These are referred to as \u201cgreen deserts\u201d \nby ecologists because, from a distance, they appear as beautiful natural forests, but on closer \ninspection, they are ecologically barren. The inability of bamboo and other plants to colonize \nthese plantations precludes their use by pandas and many other species. The exotic trees were \nplanted to compensate for prior excesses in timber exploitation, but now stand in the way of \neffective nature conservation. The second outstanding issue related to links between habitats is \nthe growing number of highways and railways through the Qinling Mountains, especially the \nassociated chain-link fences that restrict animal movements and migration for giant pandas, \nclouded leopards, and golden takins. Resolution of this issue might require a combination of (i) \nmodification of the fences, (ii) construction of wildlife underpasses and overpasses, and (iii) \nstronger management of those nature reserves alongside rail and road corridors. \n \n8.  Virtually all stakeholders in the PRC conservation note that funding is seldom adequate \nfor anything more than paying salaries. Nature reserves in the PRC receive about one-eighth of \nthe world's average budget allocation per unit area ($113 vs. $893 per square kilometer [km2]), \nand even less than the average allocation for reserves in developing countries ($157 per km2). \nProvincial and local reserves receive even less ($57 per km2). In general, nature reserves \nreceive  government  funding  for  about  one-third  of  their  spending  requirements  only.  The \nbalance must be met by entrepreneurial efforts that are often antagonistic to the conservation \nmandate of the reserves. Regulation of tourism is needed to ensure that natural resources are \nnot further degraded in the interest of economic gain. \n \n                                                 \n5  Xu Jintao, E.

Introduction \n \n1.  Financial and economic analyses were undertaken for the project components. The \nProject has three components. The first component supports a number of activities in the \nprotected biodiversity area called the Qinling Biological Conservation and Demonstration Area \n(QBCDA)  and  the  wider  Qinling  Mountains,  including  (i)  habitat  reestablishment  and \nendangered species management for which project costs have been estimated and benefits \nassessed in qualitative terms; and (ii) support for residents to transition to new and more \nsustainable  livelihood  options,  including  home-stay  ventures,  road  and  mountain  pathway \nimprovement, small family-based business development, and the creation of rights to collective \nforest land to be planted into analog forest systems. Project costs have been estimated and \nbenefits estimated for representative businesses related to essential oils, medicinal plants, and \nthe home-stays. No benefits have been quantified for the shorter transport and travel times, and \nimproved water and energy supplies. The second component provides support to biodiversity \nconservation. The Implementing Agency is the Qinling National Botanical Garden (QNBG), \nwhich  will develop  the  botanical garden  and  also  consolidate  the Shaanxi  Animal  Rescue \nCenter (SARC) and QBCDA. For QNBG, project, financial, and economic costs and benefits \nhave been assessed based on the associated revenue receipts. The third component includes \nproject management support for (i) institutional arrangements, (ii) institutional strengthening, \nand (iii) conservation replication and awareness. The first two subcomponents are treated as \noverhead,  while  the  third  is  a  public  good  and  global-value  set  that  is  assessed  only  in \nqualitative terms. \n \nB.  Key Assumptions \n \n2.  The economic and financial analyses are in constant 2009 prices. The project life is \ncalculated to end in 2035. For the financial analysis, a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) \nof 2.6% is used. The financial analysis is based on cash items with noncash items, such as \ndepreciation and amortization of intangible assets, separated from operating costs. Most of the \nfinancial analyses are based on the net cash flow before the payment of corporate tax to \nremove the influence of differing taxes based on the overall tax position of each enterprise. \nDomestic price escalations are assumed to be 0.8% for 2009, 1.0% for 2010, 1.5% for 2011, \n2.0% for 2012, and 2.0% for 2013 onwards; while international price escalations are assumed to \nbe 1.9% for 2009, 1.0% for 2010,  0.0% for 2011, 0.3% for 2012, and 0.5% for 2013 onwards. \nPhysical contingencies are (i) 5% for civil works, materials, surveys, and studies; (ii) 10% for \nresettlement costs; and (iii) 2% for training. The economic analysis uses the domestic price level \n(not the world price level) as the numeraire or reference point for converting financial prices into \neconomic  prices.  Financial  prices  were  converted  to  economic  prices  by  removing  taxes, \nsubsidies, and market distortions. Sales taxes were removed from operating costs and/or cash \noutflow and a factor of 0.95 was applied to the nonwage purchases of the revenue-earning \nentities. This is consistent with a sales tax rate of about 5%. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.8 \nhas been applied to casual and unskilled labor costs. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was \nused for construction, and botanical tree and garden planting costs. Upgrading of road and \nmountain pathways used a standard conversion factor of 0.84 for casual labor. \n \nC.  Project Assessment \n \n3.  In addition to the quantified benefits that have been incorporated into the financial and \neconomic assessments, the Project will generate many benefits that have not been quantified. \nMost of these benefits fall into two major categories: (i) environmental and ecosystem benefits; \nand (ii) quality of life, cultural, religious, and heritage values. Together, these are significant \n ", "44  Appendix 11 \nbenefits  that  add  further  justification  for  the  Project,  whose  primary  impact  is  to  develop \nsustainable conservation of biodiversity. Included in these categories are (i) benefits accruing \nfrom the improvements in the welfare of animals in SARC and in QBCDA; (ii) benefits from \nendangered-species recovery from SARC; (iii) benefits from the genetic collection established at \nQNBG; (iv) benefits arising from public awareness and education with respect to the Qinling \nMountains and biodiversity conservation; (v) benefits in the overall conservation of biodiversity; \n(vi) improvement in ecological functions in QBCDA from more and higher-quality forest cover; \n(vii)  intangible  benefits  arising  from  the  conservation  of  Taoist  religious  sites;  and  (viii) \nimprovements in environmental quality through the provision of better sanitation, wastewater, \nand management systems. Further tangible but not quantified benefits are generated for the \ncurrent  4,600  residents  of  QBCDA.  These  include  (i)  payment  for  the  establishment  of \nconservation forestry over 7,000 hectares that will provide jobs; (ii) shorter travel time because \nof improved road and mountain pathway access; (iii) higher economic output derived from \nalternative livelihoods, as represented by medicinal plants, essential oils, biogas systems, and \nhome-stay tourism; and (iv) better health from improvement in access to water, alternative \nsources of energy, and reduced fuel wood cutting. \n \n1.  Component 1: Participatory Biodiversity Management in the Mountainous \nArea \n \n4.  The Project will gradually improve the population of endangered flora and fauna species \nin  QBCDA  by  increasing  mixed  forest  coverage  and  creating  the  incentives  for  species \nregeneration. Forest expansion and improved management will also reduce soil degradation \nand erosion. The production of non-timber forest products that increases forest pathways will be \nimproved. Local communities in QBCDA are keen to participate in the Project and assist with \nforest management and species regeneration. They are also eager to improve livelihoods and \nquality of life through ecotourism home-stays and village development planning. Community-\nbased ecotourism home stays for medium- to high-value clients will be developed to support the \ngrowing demand for overnight accommodation in wild or natural environments. The financial \nanalysis indicates a financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 19.1% for a 4-room home-stay that \nwill employ 8\u201310 people full time. The financial model assumes 40% occupancy, increasing to \n50% after 10 years, and stabilizing at that level with an average tariff per night of CNY150. The \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) for a single home-stay is 23.4%, indicating that the \nhome-stay  is  economically  justified.  Community  infrastructure,  including  17.5  kilometers  of \nroads along the Tianyu River and about 100 kilometers of mountain pathways, will be upgraded \nto reduce travel times and ensure access during adverse weather. No estimates have been \nmade of the time savings. Grants are proposed for either villages or households to develop \nsocial infrastructure, especially alternative energy sources (biogas and solar) and water supply \nschemes. The benefits have not been quantified. \n \n5.  The investment in component 1 is estimated to generate about 10,000 jobs during the \nconstruction phase of the Project, and about 450 from 2015. These levels of employment are \nsignificant and suggest that close to 33% of QBCDA households could receive an additional \nwage after the construction period. Equally important, the conservation forestry program could \naffect more than 70% of QBCDA households through participation in planting programs and \nobtaining secure tenure to collective forests.  \n \n2.  Component 2: Enhanced Biodiversity Conservation in the Plains Area \n \n6.  QNBG will derive its revenue from the botanical garden division and the SARC division. \nIt will generate total revenue of CNY127.5 million by 2015, and CNY250 million by 2025. \nBenefits were estimated based on a visitor profile for the botanical garden, starting from the \n ", "Appendix 11        45 \ncurrent level of 350,000 and increasing at an average rate of 5.3% over the life of the analysis. \nFor SARC, the visitors are projected to start from 280,000, and grow at 15% per year. The total \nnumber of visitors is expected to reach about 800,000 by 2013, which is a conservative estimate \ngiven the higher rates of growth for tourism, including ecotourism in Shaanxi province. Entry \nfees of CNY50 per visitor were used in the analysis.  \n \n7.  The FIRR for the QNBG division is 9.5% before tax and 8.0% after tax. Sensitivity \nanalysis was conducted on the financial rates of returns for shifts in revenue and costs, and \nfound to be robust (Table A11.1). The EIRR of the QNBG division was estimated to be 10.9%. \nThe EIRR is sensitive to the movement in revenue and costs (Table A11.2). Given the difficulty \nin  revenue  forecasting,  a  careful  reassessment  of  the  investment  and  the  underlying \nassumptions is needed. A conservative estimate was taken for visitor numbers. The QNBG \ndivision is a viable investment, but the risk of commercial failure during the first 5\u201310 years is \nconsiderable. Experienced commercial management, cost reviews, and more market research \nare important risk management strategies. \n \nTable A11.1: Qinling National Botanical Garden Division Financial Sensitivity Analysis \nFinancial Internal Rate of Return (%) \nItem \nBefore Tax  After Tax \nBase Case  9.5  8.0 \nInvestment Cost and Implementation Delay (10% increase)  8.7  7.2 \nEcotourism Revenue (10% decrease)  8.0  6.6 \n   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable A11.2: Qinling National Botanical Garden Division Economic Sensitivity Analysis \nItem  Economic Internal Rate of Return (%) \nBase Case  10.9 \nInvestment Cost and Implementation Delay (10% increase)  10.0 \nInvestment Cost (20% increase)  9.4 \nEcotourism Revenue (10% decrease)  9.3 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n8.  For the SARC division, the FIRR was estimated to be 16% before tax and 13.5% after \ntax, both of which are well above the WACC. The income transfer to QBCDA based on 8% of \nthe net profit will produce a contribution of $160,000 in 2013 and reduces the post-tax FIRR to \n12.75%. The financial viability was found to be robust under scenarios involving up to 30% \nmovement of current projections (Table A11.3). Strengthening management will reduce the risks \nattached to the operation of SARC. The EIRR of SARC is 17.9%, based on the net cash flow for \n\u201cwith project\u201d and \u201cwithout project\u201d scenarios. The EIRR was found to be robust up to 20% \nmovement in either the costs or revenue streams. Given the conservative visitor numbers, the \ninvestment as forecast is considered to be economically feasible (Table A11.4). \n \nTable A11.3: Shaanxi Animal Rescue Center Financial Sensitivity Analysis \nFinancial Internal Rate of Return (%) \nItem  Before Tax   After Tax  \nBase Case  16.0  13.5 \nInvestment Cost (30% increase)  13.6  11.5 \nEcotourism Revenue (30% decrease)  10.5  8.7 \n                       Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n \n \n ", "46  Appendix 11 \nTable A11.4: Shaanxi Animal Rescue Center Economic Sensitivity Analysis \nItem  Economic Internal Rate of Return (%) \nBase Case  17.9 \nInvestment Cost (40% increase)  14.5 \nEcotourism Revenue (20% decrease)  13.6 \nEcotourism Revenue (30% decrease)  11.8 \n   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n9.  The combined QNBG divisions have an estimated FIRR of 12.1% before tax and 10.2% \nafter tax. The FIRR declines to 9.3% after the inclusion of shareholder payments for QNBG \nresettlement and the transfer of funds to the conservation investment program in QBCDA and \nthe Qinling Mountains.

The EIRR for the combined enterprises is estimated to be 13.7% and is considered to be \neconomically justified (Table A11.6). These benefits do not include the intangible benefits linked \nto  species  conservation,  awareness  and  education,  and  the  scientific  knowledge  to  be \ndeveloped from QNBG and SARC. The beneficiaries include the domestic and international \ntourists who will visit the ecotourism sites and enjoy the facilities and services, and will learn \nmore  about  the  Qinling  Mountains  resources,  history,  culture,  and  religions.  The  target \nbeneficiaries within the project area will receive jobs generated by constructing and operating \nthe facilities.

Summary of Project Assessment \n \n11.  The Project results in significant economic and environmental benefits. Indirect benefits \ninclude the supply of goods and services by local businesses and households, and contracts to \nvillage groups and small businesses to conduct biodiversity conservation activities. Another set \nof benefits is the value that people place on improvements to the Qinling Mountains. To some \ndegree, these benefits can be quantified and given monetary values through willingness-to-pay \nsurveys and through the donations that private individuals, foundations, corporations, and other \ngroups may provide to accelerate government and international efforts to restore the Qinling \nMountains.  \n \n12.  The estimated EIRR for the whole project is 10.9%. The EIRR is sensitive to price \nchanges. Additional nonquantifiable benefits relating to biodiversity conservation, ecological \nfunction improvement, and rural livelihoods benefits are significant and will further increase the \noverall  economic  performance.  The  investment  is  considered  economically  feasible  and \nenvironmentally sound, and these benefits will make the EIRR for the entire Project within the \nacceptable range. \n ", "4  8  Appendix 12            \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n1.

This summary initial \nenvironmental  examination  (SIEE)  was  prepared  based  on  the  Qinling  National  Botanical \nGarden (QNBG) environmental impact assessment (EIA) report1 prepared in accordance with \nthe regulations of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). These reports comply with Asian \nDevelopment Bank requirements for category B projects. \n \nA.  Project Description \n2.  The project area is on the northern slope of the Qinling Mountains, about 45 kilometers \n(km) from Xi'an, comprising an area of 458 square kilometers with about 20,400 people. The \nQinling Mountains is an internationally-important biodiversity hot spot and represents about 70% \nof the PRC\u2019s biodiversity, including an estimated 300 giant pandas. The Qinling Mountains is \ncentral to soil and water management linked to the Yangtze and Yellow rivers. The Project will \nimprove  biodiversity  conservation  and  management  by  restoring  forest  habitat,  improving \nendangered species management, and providing sustainable livelihoods for the population of \nthe project area, and demonstrating the benefits to the rest of the Qinling Mountains and other \nsimilar areas in the PRC. The Project will provide significant environmental, economic, and \nsocial benefits throughout the project area. The Project will address underlying causes and \neffects of historical and contemporary resource degradation. It will have three primary outputs: \n(i) participatory biodiversity management in the mountainous area, (ii) enhanced biodiversity \nconservation in the plains area, and (iii) improved project management. Using sustainable \nfinancing mechanisms for biodiversity conservation, the habitat of the protected area, Qinling \nBiological Conservation and Demonstration Area (QBCDA), will be improved to promote mixed \nforest coverage, and flora and fauna species expansion. The small population that lives in \nscattered  settlements  in  QBCDA  will  be  encouraged  to  support  biodiversity  conservation \nobjectives and stop unsustainable farming and other activities. \n \n3.  Plains Area. This area consists of a 2-km wide strip of predominantly flat land along the \nnorth side of the Qinling Mountains that is developed for ecotourism, agricultural, and residential \npurposes. The population is about 15,800. The Project will support the following: \n \n(i)  QNBG. The activities proposed under this subcomponent include building 18 \nspecialized gardens and other infrastructure, covering about 269 hectares (ha); \none  greenhouse  of  600  square  meters  (m2);  two  main  exhibition  halls;  and \nresearch facilities and infrastructure, including irrigation system, drinking water \nsupply, wastewater treatment, solid waste management, roads, and cableway. \nThis component also includes restoration of 18 Taoist religious buildings and \ntemples.  The  number  of  annual  visitors to  the  gardens and  Shaanxi  Animal \nRescue Center (SARC) is projected to be 478,000 by 2015. \n(ii)  SARC. The proposed SARC development will expand from the current 141 ha to \n1,008 ha. The expanded SARC is being designed to promote animal welfare and \ncaptive breeding of at-risk species. These functions are linked to ecotourism \ndevelopment,  as  well  as  to  the  adoption  of  new  innovative  approaches  for \nrescuing, protecting, and improving the living conditions of endangered and rare \nwild animals. The proposed activities include (a) building an animal hospital, a \nrescue and emergency department, a zoology research lab, and a dormitory for \nexperts; (b) breeding and raising bases for giant pandas, crested ibis, and golden \nmonkeys, and other artiodactyls, as well as forage bases for the above animals; \n                                                 \n1  The Shaanxi Qinling Botanical Garden and the Shaanxi Animal Rescue Center completed by Xi'an University of \nArchitecture and Technology, May 2007. \n ", "Appendix 12        49 \n(c) establishing animal protection and exhibition facilities; and (d) constructing \ninfrastructure, including internal roads and paths, and a wastewater treatment \nplant. \n \n4.  QBCDA.  QBCDA  consists  of  steep  land  with  a  population  of  about  4,600  persons \ndispersed over about 400 square kilometers. The Louguantai Forest Farm previously managed \nthe area, which had large areas that were heavily logged. More remote areas retain high-\nbiodiversity values. The Project will support habitat rehabilitation for biodiversity conservation. \nQBCDA has a number of isolated communities practicing unsustainable agriculture on steep \nslopes that will be assisted to develop more sustainable livelihoods and adopt more appropriate \nland-use practices. The long-term vision for QBCDA is to develop and enhance the ecological \nsustainability of natural resources and ecosystems to increase biodiversity. Models developed in \nthe management of QBCDA will be extended with financing to nature reserves in the Qinling \nMountains.  \n \nB.  Description of the Environment \n5.  More than 90% of the Qinling Mountains has been degraded through inappropriate \nfarming, logging, overuse of natural resources, destructive mining operations, and pollution from \nsolid waste and agro-chemicals over many decades. As a result, the water resource quality is in \nserious decline. The project area has two major rivers, the Tianyu and Jiuyu rivers. The water \nquality of Tianyu River meets the class I water standard\u2014water from natural sources, except \ncoliform  bacteria,  which  is  associated  with  the  discharge  of  human  and  animal  waste. \nGroundwater from Dianzhen village adjacent to the site of the botanical garden meets the class \nIII quality standard for groundwater, except ammonia and coliform. The high ammonia may be \nassociated with the agricultural activities.   \n \n6.  The Qinling Mountains is biologically rich, with many endangered rare or endemic plant \nand animal species, including the giant panda, golden takin, golden snub-nosed monkey, and \ncrested ibis (the national bird of Japan). The mountains are characterized by very high levels of \nendemic biodiversity found in temperate and subtropical ecosystems, as well as a vertical \nspectrum of vegetation types; 70% of all vegetation types in the PRC are represented. In the \nproject area, six species are globally threatened, including four amphibians and two reptiles. \nTwo species of fish are vulnerable, one of which is protected in Shaanxi, the other is listed in the \nnational red data book as class II. Noted species of concern in the Tianyu River include the \nManchurian  trout,  the  giant  salamander,  and  the  soft-shelled  tortoise.  The  project  area  is \nincluded in the Qinling Mountains Ecosystem Function Conservation Area (QMEFCA) within the \nhigh-priority Central Conservation Zone of Qinling Water Resources and Biodiversity Function \nZone.  The  proposed  activities  in  this  Project  are  consistent  with  the  requirements  of  the \nQMEFCA.  Under  the  proposed  QMEFCA  framework,  the  Shanxi  Environmental  Protection \nBureau  prepared  and  approved  the  Shaanxi  Qinling  Mountains  Northern  Slope  Ecological \nEnvironment  Protection  Plan  in  March  2007.  The  Project  conforms  to  the  development \nstandards stated in the plan. The population of the project area has living standards well below \nprovincial averages.   \n \nC.  Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n7.  QNBG. Potential adverse impacts associated with the QNBG include (i) those arising \nfrom road and cableway construction; (ii) impacts of exotic species on indigenous species; (iii) \nimpacts on local water resources from water supply extraction; (iv) wastewater and solid waste \nimpacts; and (v) impacts to landscape, culture, and religion. A total of 33.5 km roads will be \nimproved (including about 13 km of roads in the plains area and 17.5 km of the road in \nQBCDA), and a cableway will be constructed for QNBG. Potential adverse impacts from road \n ", "50  Appendix 12 \nand other construction activities would affect soil, water resources, and air quality. Potential \nimpacts on the soil by road construction are from soil erosion and soil contamination. Mitigation \nmeasures against soil erosion during construction will include appropriate engineering design \n(batter  slopes,  compaction  levels,  installation  of  culverts,  etc.),  planting  of  vegetation, \nconstruction of appropriate storm water drainage, and limiting off-corridor vehicle movements. \nMitigation against loss of agricultural land includes (i) where possible, not locating construction \ncamps and material storage areas on agricultural land, and using preexisting hardstand storage \nareas;  (ii)  where  this  is  impossible,  rehabilitating  agricultural  land  after  completion  of \nconstruction,  and  removing  the  construction  camps  and  material  storage  areas;  and  (iii) \nconfining  construction traffic  to  the  existing  road  corridor.  Mitigation  measures against soil \ncontamination  will  include  (i)  appropriate  storage  of  hazardous  materials  (including \nhydrocarbons), and hazardous and nonhazardous wastes; (ii) provision of an oil interceptor for \nall vehicle wash-down activities; and (iii) disposal of all hazardous wastes and nonhazardous \nwastes  at  local  municipal  waste  disposal  facilities;  there  will  be  no  site-specific  landfills \ndeveloped for the Project. The potential impact on water resources along the alignment includes \nhydrocarbon leaks and sewage discharge from construction camps. Sanitary wastewater from \nthe construction camps will be collected and disposed at nearby municipal treatment facilities. \nSanitary wastewater will not be disposed untreated in adjacent waterways. Hydrocarbon leaks \nwill be mitigated through appropriate storage and handling of hydrocarbon in work camps, \nincluding secondary containment and provision of spills cleanup equipment.  \n \n8.  The specialized gardens will involve more than 1,000 species of plants. Exotic species \npossibly invading QBCDA is a threat. QNBG will develop and implement an environmental risk \nassessment for biosafety as part of the detailed design. QNBG will receive water from two \nsources. About 1,405 tons per day (t/d) of surface water will be taken from the Tianyu River \n(less than 1% of total flow) for the irrigation system (west part). About 252 t/d of groundwater will \nbe extracted from a well near the Tianyu River. Given the sufficient precipitation and surface \nwater  recharge  in  the  area,  the  demand  is  not  significant  and  potential  impacts  can  be \nminimized  by  site  selection,  water  saving,  and  a  monitoring  program.  About  201  tons  of \nwastewater and 1.51 tons of solid wastes will be produced daily. Secondary sewage treatment \nwill be constructed to treat sewage up to the national irrigation standard, and discharge will be \nused for grey water irrigation purposes. Solid waste will be collected and sorted for recycling on-\nsite, and then trucked to the municipal solid waste treatment facility. Reconstruction of the eight \nhistorical culture sites ranging from 200 m2 to 3,600 m2 will add to local cultural values. The \npublic and religious groups will be consulted on the design and style of these reconstructions to \nensure the building designs are acceptable.  \n  \n9.  SARC. Potential impacts will include (i) soil erosion, (ii) source water protection, (iii) loss \nof vegetation, (iv) water pollution, and (v) waste disposal. Of the expanded area, 85% will be \nused for forage bases to plant bamboo and other suitable plants and fruits for the animals. This \noperation will be favorable for water and soil conservation. However, 64 ha of land will be \nconverted for animal breeding and raising. Development of infrastructure facilities in these \nbases may create soil erosion during construction. The soil erosion will be effectively controlled \nby sound planning, good engineering, and integrated management. Water pollution associated \nwith  SARC  would  mainly  occur  in  the  main  area  and  the  satellite  centers.  A  secondary \nwastewater treatment facility with a capacity of 300 t/d is designed for treating wastewater \ngenerated by animals and visitors. The sewage generated in the satellite centers is relatively \nsmall and scattered, and is currently sold to local farmers. The treated effluent will be used for \nirrigation, and none will be discharged directly into the surface water. Solid waste management \nand the potential impacts from road construction will be managed in a similar way as proposed \nfor QNBG. \n \n ", "Appendix 12        51 \n10.  QBCDA. QBCDA will be managed for the primary purpose of biodiversity conservation. \nThe long-term vision for QBCDA is to develop and enhance the ecological sustainability of \nnatural  resources  and  ecosystems  to  enable  biodiversity  to  be  increased,  managed,  and \nsecured. The long-term status of QBCDA involves better coverage and quality of forest to \nincrease the habitat for the Qinling Mountains biodiversity. The reforestation and silviculture \ndevelopment proposed, while on a large scale, is not expected to have any negative effects and \nwill be managed through the preparation of a habitat and forest management plan for QBCDA. \nThe project management office (PMO) and QNBG will screen any small business development, \nincluding home-stay tourism and forest-product processing.  \n \n11.  The provision of social infrastructure is linked to water and solar energy, and ecotourism \nactivities. These will be mitigated by the following environmental considerations:  \n(i)  the design should be consistent with the landscape and will include sustainable \npractices to reduce environmental impact; \n(ii)  low energy consumption technologies for lighting will be utilized;  \n(iii)  biodegradable solid waste will be converted into compost that can be used on \nsite. Nonbiodegradable waste would be collected and removed for disposal in the \nmunicipal landfill or recycled; \n(iv)  water supply is expected to come from a local spring source (quality tested); \n(v)  for sewage and wastewater, septic tanks combined with on-site small biological \ntreatment will be applied;  \n(vi)  existing footpaths will be used for walking trails; because there are few users, no \nupgrading or surfacing of paths will be required; and \n(vii)  the ecology, home-stay, and other micro-scale resource-based tourism activities \nwill be managed under an environmental monitoring plan.  \n \n12.  Some road and mountain pathway improvement will also be conducted, including the \ncanyon  road  (17.5  km)  and  mountain  paths  (100  km).  Potential  adverse  impacts  are  (i) \nuncontrolled vehicles and visitors; (ii) construction requiring earthworks; (iii) possible blockage \nof wildlife movement; (iv) impacts during construction (wildlife disturbance and temporary or \npermanent displacement); (v) riverbank erosion by increased traffic, unintentional wildlife, and \nhabitat  disturbance;  and  (vi)  other  construction-associated  impact.  Mitigation  measures  will \ninclude (i) careful site (alignment) design to avoid encroachment into the sensitive wildlife area; \n(ii) controlled attendance at the QNBG entrance and implementation of an access management \nplan; (iii) no construction between dusk and dawn, and avoidance of excessive noise; and (iv) \nreplanting and afforestation along the road and riverbanks to minimize soil erosion and protect \nhabitat.  Construction  mitigation  measures  for  the  roads  component  will  be  the  same  as \ndescribed for the QNBG.  \n \nD.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n13.  Institutional Requirements. The Shaanxi provincial government, the Executing Agency \nfor the Project, will have overall responsibility for ensuring that all environmental standards and \nprocedures  are  followed.  Under  the  supervision  of  Provincial  Development  and  Reform \nCommission, the Implementing Agency, QNBG, will be responsible for the implementation of all \ncorresponding environmental mitigation measures and for monitoring programs recommended \nin  its  EIA  and  this  SIEE.  Before  project  construction,  QNBG  will  form  an  environmental \nmanagement unit (EMU) for environmental management and operation, including environmental \nsupervision  of  contractors.  The  EMU  will  ensure  the  implementation  of  the  environmental \nmanagement plan and environmental monitoring plan during construction and operation of the \nProject. The construction contractor will designate an environmental representative, who will be \n ", "52  Appendix 12 \nresponsible  for  the  environmental  management  of  construction  activities  during  project \nconstruction.  \n \n14.  Environmental  Management  and  Monitoring  Plan.  The  summary  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP), included in this SIEE, is based on the full EMP included in the EIA \nreports. The PMO will translate the SIEE, including the summary EMP, into Chinese. The PMO \nwill ensure that the SIEE (including summary EMP) and the full EMP in the corresponding EIA \nare included in all contractors bidding documents and operating contracts. The EMU will be \nresponsible for implementing the EMP during project construction and operation. The EMU will \nensure  that  the  EMP  is  updated  periodically  during  construction.  The  Project  will  utilize \nappropriately  qualified  environmental  monitoring  service  providers  for  conducting  the \nenvironmental monitoring duties specified in this SIEE. The environmental monitoring agency \nwill conduct the monitoring program and submit monitoring reports to the (i) PMO, (ii) Shaanxi \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau, (iii) QNBG, and (iv) Asian Development Bank semiannually \nduring construction.  \n \nE.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n15.  Public consultation consisted of issuing questionnaire surveys to affected persons and \nholding workshops with relevant stakeholders. Two public consultative surveys were conducted \nduring project preparation, consisting of (i) 24 valid respondents from 30 questionnaires during \npreparation  of  the  EIA,  and  (ii)  97  valid  respondents  from  101  questionnaires  during  the \nsupplementary EIA study. The surveys are considered to have sufficient representatives in the \nproject area. Two workshops were also held with a panel of 47 participants, including provincial \nand local government representatives. Leaders of the townships and villages in the vicinity of \nthe project area, academy, and nongovernment organization representatives, such as the Xi'an \noffice of the World Wide Fund for Nature, were fully involved in the workshops. Information \nregarding the Project was also disseminated to the public through media and QNBG\u2019s website. \nThe  public  participation  has  played  an  important  role  in  the  EIA  and  project  design.  For \nexample, the width of the road from Jinniuping to Caihulu via Shouyangshan has been reduced \nfrom 6 meters to 1.5 meters with a saving of about $1.7 million. These adjustments will not only \nsave the project cost but reduce the potential environmental impact on the fragile ecosystem in \nthe project area and contribute to a sustainable and cost-effective investment. \n \nF.  Conclusion \n \n16.  The analysis undertaken in this SIEE indicates that the majority of the Project\u2019s impacts \nis environmentally beneficial, and will have a large and positive impact on securing long-term \nbiodiversity  conservation  and  sustainability  in  the  Qinling  Mountains.  Some  minor  adverse \nimpacts are associated with the Project, mainly related to construction activities. All of these can \nbe mitigated by appropriate measures. Therefore, no further EIA is required. \n \n ", "  Appendix 13          5  3\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nCountry/Project Title: People\u2019s Republic of China/Shaanxi Qinling Biodiversity Conservation and Demonstration Project \nLending/Financing  Department/  East Asia Department/ \nProject based \nModality:  Division:  Agriculture, Environment, and Natural Resources Division \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) Country Partnership Strategy 2008\u20132010 for the People\u2019s Republic of China a (PRC) \nhighlighted ADB\u2019s priorities which are in line with the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) and stresses its continual efforts to \nsupport the Government to (i) sharpen its fight against poverty; and (ii) achieve the Millennium Development Goals, including \npolicy work in such areas as social protection, strengthening the role of nongovernment agencies in reducing poverty, and \ncooperating with development partners to advance policy dialogue on the changing nature of poverty in the PRC. Nationally, \nthe majority of the poor live in the central and western provinces, which lag behind the eastern provinces in achieving the \nMillenium Development Goals. In these regions, poverty is rural and strongly correlated to access to land and the incidence of \nland degradation. Growth has outpaced environmental sustainability in many of these areas and the environment has become \na major constraint to sustained economic development. Environmental protection, ecosystem restoration, and biodiversity \nconservation are the key priorities in the western development strategy. The majority of ADB\u2019s lending to the interior provinces \nseek to create a climate for pro-poor economic growth. Ongoing ADB-financed policy work is addressing poverty-related \nissues in health, education, social protection, nutrition, land degradation, access to clean drinking water, and sanitation in \nrural areas. The Poverty Partnership Agreement, signed by the Government and ADB in September 2003, sets out strategies \nand interventions for poverty reduction. The Government and ADB will continue to (i) cooperate on a broad range of activities \nrelated to policy and regulatory reform, and capacity building in the environment sector; and (ii) support projects to address \nenvironmental problems. Projects will be designed so that the poor capture some of the environmental benefits. To sharpen \nthe poverty focus of its environmental work, the Government and ADB are addressing land degradation by supporting the \nimplementation  of  the  10-year  PRC-Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  Partnership  for  Land  Degradation  in  Dryland \nEcosystems. \n \nThe Project directly contributes to these objectives by introducing biodiversity management models, which promotes market-\ndriven biodiversity conservation and provides sustainable livelihoods for the population of the project area that can be \ndemonstrated for, and replicated in the wider Qinling Mountains. The Project promotes the participation and empowerment of \nrural communities and sustainable livelihood by means of (i) improved agricultural and other technologies; (ii) value addition; \nand (iii) non-extractive use of natural resources using commercial enterprises in such areas as ecotourism, Chinese herbal \nmedicines,  non-timber  forest  products,  biodiversity  conservation  services,  and  innovation  in  public\u2013private-community \npartnerships. \n \nThe project area is within the Qinling Mountains and is a highly-complex area of different geographic features, settlement \npatterns and densities, and multiple and overlapping land use and related management rights among forestry and other \ngovernment agencies, Zhouzhi County, and various townships, villages, and households. The total registered population in \nthe project area is about 20,400 including 3 townships and 30 administrative villages. No ethnic minorities are living in the \nproject area. Poverty is widespread both in the Qinling Mountains and the project area based on the national poverty \nbenchmark, with small-scale agriculture on steep slopes, very limited infrastructure throughout the rugged and isolated \nvalleys, and few links to the modern economy. Zhouzhi County is directly under Xi'an City. Its total area is 2,974 square \nkilometers, including 2,200 square kilometers of mountain area in the Qinling Mountains that takes up 74% of the total land \narea, cultivated land covers 60,000 mu (land measurement) and forestland 196,600 mu. Gross domestic product/capita in \nZhouzhi County is estimated to be only 50% of the provincial average, 30% of the average for the total country, and only 20% \nof the average for the Xi'an urban districts. Zhouzhi County is well below the provincial and national averages in virtually all of \nthe main socioeconomic indicators\u2014retail sales per capita, gross fixed investment, household savings, and fiscal capacity. \nNet farmer per capita income in Zhouzhi County was only CNY1,317 in 2005, which was only 40% of the national average, \nand 64% of the provincial average in that year. Despite its low household incomes and levels of development, Zhouzhi County \nis not a national or provincial poverty county under national or provincial programs. However, about 17% of the Zhouzhi \nCounty population reportedly is below the poverty line, and 103 out of 379 administrative villages in the county are considered \nto be poverty villages. Poverty levels are particularly high in the mountain areas where 60% of the population is below the \npoverty threshold. Mountain areas account for about 74% of the county\u2019s land area, 60% of its poverty population, but only \n10% of the total population. \n \n \n \n \n ", "54  Appendix 13 \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nPoverty in the project area remains significant. Using the poverty line of Shaanxi province of CNY865 per capita per year \nresults in 21 villages out of 30 being poor. A survey done in 2005 by the Provincial Poverty Reduction Office shows that a total \nof 7,586 people in both ex-situ and in-situ are counted as poverty population covering 1,889 households. Further splitting the \npoverty populations into the protected and mountainous Qinling Biological Conservation and Demonstration Area (QBCDA) \nand the commercial and agricultural area in the plains or flat lands, higher poverty incidence occurs in QBCDA. About 4,600 \npeople or 23% of the total population in the project area live in QBCDA, of which about 73% is poor. By contrast, of the \n19,800 residents in the plains area, about 27% is poor. The poverty ratio in the overall project area is about 37%. The project \npoverty classification fits the \u201cgeneral intervention\u201d as less than 50% of the population comprises the poor among project \nbeneficiaries. \n \nPoverty analysis was undertaken using formal field surveys and participatory key informant discussions throughout the project \narea. Institutional consultation was undertaken regarding the ongoing efforts and experiences in poverty reduction in the \nprovince. The design of interventions on improving rural livelihoods and poverty reduction will result in improvements through \nincreased incomes while conservation of the environment, a strong and growing ecotourism sector through construction of an \ninternational standard Qinling National Botanical Garden (QNBG), an expansion of the Animal Rescue Center (Shaanxi \nAnimal Rescue Center [SARC], which is part of QNBG), reconstruction of several temples with the cooperation of the \nLouguantai Daoist Temple, as well as associated alternative livelihood opportunities and training for more sustainable \nlivelihoods through higher incomes, job creation, and small business opportunities. \n \n2. Design Features \nA social and poverty assessment was carried out in compliance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Incorporation of Social Dimensions \nin Bank Operations (1997). The assessment included a rural livelihood assessment which confirmed disparate growth rates \nbetween sectors resulting in large income inequities between rural and urban residents, and between different rural areas. \nThe causes of poverty in the project area are complex, but these are associated with land degradation and the harsh human \nliving conditions. The following causes were identified during the household survey and the assessment exercises: (i) \npervasive small-scale agriculture on steep slopes, threatened by wild animals; (ii) limited infrastructure; (iii) limited alternatives \nfor other livelihood activities; (iv) unsustainable land conversion program, and no alternative job and income opportunities for \nsurplus labor; (v) poor access to social services such as education and health care with few links to the modern economy; and \n(vi) traditional agricultural practices are used as the main exit from poverty, which leads to limited solutions for high poverty \nlevels and can further degrade the environment. \n \nThe National Poverty Reduction program is still being implemented in QBCDA. Specific alternative livelihood activities as well \nas improvements to infrastructure such as roads, water supply, etc., will directly benefit these communities, reduce their \nreliance on low-productive sloped land farming, and provide increased access to income-generating activities. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \nKey Issues. The villages in the biodiversity conservation area, QBCDA, are poorer and with less social services and \neconomic opportunities than the villages in the northern plains section of the project area that has more tourism and \nagriculture with substantially more population. The population in QBCDA of about 4,600 will be targeted for employment \nopportunities in ecotourism and forest replanting on community forest land. These villagers have experienced substantial out-\nmigration  of  younger  people  seeking  more  lucrative  employment  opportunities.  The  remaining  population  practices \nunsustainable agriculture on steep slopes that is environmentally harmful to the biodiversity of QBCDA. Under the Project, \nthese villagers will receive (i) direct employment benefits; (ii) paid land conversion programs supporting conservation forest \nplantings; and (iii) opportunities to start small businesses, and improved access to water supplies and alternative energy \nsources. It is expected that villagers in QBCDA will voluntarily move out of agriculture and into forest-based livelihoods that \nwill provide long-term benefits. The Project will provide more sustainable alternative livelihoods. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \nConsultation with stakeholders, beneficiaries, and directly-affected people has been undertaken and will continue during the \ndesign  and  implementation  of  the  Project.  Detailed  discussion  with  the  Xi'an  City  government,  the  line  agencies, \nrepresentatives of QNBG and other investors, cultural and ecotourism operations, and groups of rural residents were held. \nThe project management office (PMO) under the Executing Agency, the Shaanxi provincial government, was established. The \nleading group is chaired by the Governor, and will coordinate and enlist the support of involved and concerned agencies to \nensure smooth implementation. The group will also play its role as a steering committee. The PMO is engaging 11 staff and \nlinks closely to the existing QNBG. In addition, the ongoing PRC-GEF Partnership on Land Degradation will provide an \nopportunity to build capacity in project planning and implementation. The PMO has provided assistance in making local \nexperts from different disciplines available to work with the Project. \n ", "Appendix 13        55 \n \nA participatory and consultative methodology was adopted to undertake the social analysis and rural livelihood survey during \nthe project preparatory technical assistance. It involved (i) a formal questionnaire survey of 200 households; (ii) discussions \nwith project stakeholders; (iii) key informant interviews in rural communities; (iv) a series of stakeholder workshops; and (v) \ninterviews  with  key  government  staff,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  women.  During  project  implementation,  the \nparticipation of stakeholders will be further supported and deepened. An institutional framework is included, which will provide \nfurther opportunity for participation in both planning and implementation. Institutional capacity building will be undertaken early \nin the project design to facilitate successful operation of the Project. The resettlement plans include consultation and \nparticipation during implementation. Participatory village development planning will further enhance the participation of \nbeneficiaries. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nVillagers in QBCDA will be involved and will participate fully in the village development plans and the implementation of \nconservation forestry activities on community forest land. Resettlement by QNBG will be conducted with full participation of \naffected villagers near Dianzhen village. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. Gender roles are determined by a combination of cultural factors, occupations, environmental conditions, \neducation levels, and employment opportunities. In the project area, income inequities create incentives for rural workers to \nmigrate to urban labor markets. However, due to its close location to good roads and to both county town and township \ncompounds, female laborers, particularly young women, share the available opportunities with men for off-farm jobs. Only \nslight agricultural feminization in the developed commercial and agricultural area is observed, while in QBCDA, young people \ntend to be mobile and the group left behind is older. There is high illiteracy among women in some QBCDA villages. \n \n2.  Key Actions.

As part of the participation \nstrategy, priority will be given to women for direct and indirect project benefits and for protection against social risk. Special \ngender measures have been included in the resettlement plans. Gender disaggregated indicators will be monitored in the \nproject performance management system. The Project will not have significant negative impacts on women, but a proposed \ngender plan will ensure equal participation of women in project activities and equal opportunities of women for access to \nsocial services, training, employment, land relocation, and beneficiary agreements. \n \nIII.

People's Republic of China: Country Partnership Strategy 2008\u20132010. Manila. \nb  ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) defines resettlement as \u201csignificant\u201d where 200 or more people experience \nmajor impacts. Major impacts are defined as involving affected people being physically displaced from housing and/or losing \n10% or more of their productive, income-generating assets. \n \n ", "Appendix 14             57 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \n1.  The Project has three components or activities that could cause resettlement impacts: (i) \nthe Qinling National Botanical Garden (QNBG), (ii) the Shaanxi Animal Rescue Center (SARC), \nand (iii) the forest conservation in the Qinling Biological Conservation and Demonstration Area \n(QBCDA). Each subcomponent was investigated and it was found that only two required a \nresettlement  plan\u2014QNBG  and  SARC.  The  other  two  subcomponents  do  not  involve \nresettlement  impacts.  The  Implementing  Agency  is  QNBG,1 which  is  responsible  for  the \nbotanical gardens, SARC, and QBCDA. \n \n2.  QNBG. QNBG is planned to cover an area of 269.3 hectares (ha), or 4,039.5 mu,2 of \ncollective land that is currently owned by Dianzhen village. QNBG plans to acquire up to 427 \nmu3 of land for the main buildings and other infrastructure, and to lease the remaining 3,612.5 \nmu of garden areas from the villagers who will become shareholders in the QNBG company.  \nFor the initial stage, 293.63 mu of land will be permanently acquired, including (i) 133.0 mu of \nirrigated land, (ii) 42.2 mu of dry farmland, (iii) 29.7 mu of orchards, (iv) 42.9 mu of housing land, \nand (v) 45.83 mu of uncultivated land. The land acquisition will affect 115 households with 504 \npeople. In addition, 19,319 square meters of houses will be demolished, which will affect 143 \nhouseholds with 617 people, who will be relocated to the main residential section of the village. \nSupporting infrastructure, including walls (3.54 kilometers [km]), power lines (0.96 km), telecom \nlines (01.125 km), 1 well, and 7,150 trees. QNBG will pay compensation of CNY51.7 million, \nincluding  taxes  and  management  fees.  The  affected  farmers  will  receive  lump  sum \ncompensation payments for permanently acquired land and housing. QNBG will lease the land-\nuse rights on 3,612.5 mu of farmland, which will affect 948 households with 3,780 people. \nHowever, village and the households will continue to own this land. QNBG will sign land-lease \nagreements with the affected groups of Dianzhen village to establish a 50-year use right for the \nbotanical gardens. QNBG will make fixed annual payments to affected households for 50 years, \nplus annual payments based on gate revenues or profit when the botanical garden becomes \noperational.  QNBG  will  also  employ  more  than  250  people  after  full  development,  and \npreference  will  be  given  to  these  shareholders  for  jobs.  This  way,  local  villagers  will  be \nadequately compensated for interim incomes losses, and will earn wages and income from \npayments as QNBG generates more revenues from new visitors to QNBG and SARC. \n \n3.  SARC. SARC will be expanded from 141 ha to 1,008 ha, but most of the land area \nalready belong to the owner, the Louguantai Forest Farm, which manages 18,780 ha of forest \narea. The expansion will require 9 ha of collectively owned land in three small parcels to be \nacquired permanently for the construction of (i) the Crested Ibis Center (2 ha), (ii) the Golden \nMonkey Center (3 ha), and (iii) the main research center (4 ha). This land acquisition involves \nminor impacts on three villages: East Louguantai, Qiandongming, and West Louguantai. The \naffected land includes 2.9 ha of dryland, 5.5 ha of slope land, and 0.6 ha irrigated land, which \nwill affect 30 households and a total of 125 people. QNBG will pay compensation of CNY13.65 \nmillion, including taxes and management fees. The affected farmers will receive lump sum \ncompensation payments for land that is permanently acquired. \n \n4.  Forest  Conservation  in  QBCDA.  This  subcomponent  includes  better  sustainable \nmanagement and conservation of natural resources, including forestry and wildlife habitat. The \nresidents of QBCDA will be directly involved in this program, development of 5,000 ha of \nconservation forestry, and ecotourism-based business development. All of these programs will \n                                                 \n1  A public sector entity has been established consisting of QNBG, SARC, and the Louguantai Forest Farm, and this \nentity manages QBCDA. \n2  15 Chinese mu = 1 hectare (ha). \n3  Initially, only 293.63 mu is to be acquired. The remainder will be purchased as the botanical gardens expand. \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \nbe voluntary. Villagers will benefit from higher agro-forestry incomes, more secure land-use \nrights on collective forest land, and employment in new ecotourism businesses. There is no \nneed for land acquisition. Any local road or village road improvements would be done along \nexisting alignments for environmental reasons. \n \n5.  Existing Socioeconomic Conditions. The incidence of poverty in QBCDA is more than \n70%, compared with 23% for the narrow northern strip of land in the project area where the \ngreat majority of the population reside. Poverty in QBCDA is highlighted by low-grain availability \nper capita of only 198 kilograms, compared with 422 kilograms in the other area. QBCDA \nincome per capita is only 18% of the national average. The livelihood survey conducted under \nthe technical assistance4 found that the stakeholders had extremely limited human capital and \nadults were poorly educated. The residents in QBCDA are sparsely scattered in 16 villages (12 \npersons per square kilometer compared with 267 per square kilometer elsewhere in the project \narea). The mountain environment has limited the development of social capital, and the local \ngovernment has encouraged out-migration to solve poverty. Recently, the physical capital has \nimproved  with  road  upgrading  along  the  Tianyu  River,  but  other  infrastructure  is  virtually \nnonexistent. Although the natural capital is extremely rich, much of the land are degraded and \nthe  forest  resources  can  no  longer  be  exploited  by  the  local  residents.  Many  of  these \nhouseholds  depend  on  subsistence  agriculture  and  subsidy  payments  from  government \nprograms. The narrow strip of good farmland just north of the Qinling Mountains supports \n15,800 residents. They are mainly engaged in farming, but many obtain most of their income \nfrom tourism-related businesses. These households are significantly better off as they have \naccess to (i) physical infrastructure, especially roads; (ii) health and education services; (iii) \nmore opportunities for off-farm employment; (iv) access to productive land and markets for high-\nvalue  fruit  crops,  including  kiwi  fruit;  and  (v)  land  for  renting  to  commercial  enterprises. \nHowever, households that are entirely dependent on farming remain relatively poor. \n \n6.  Summary of Project Impacts. To avoid or minimize land acquisition and resettlement, \nlocal officials, village committees, and affected persons were consulted during project feasibility \nplanning and resettlement plan preparation. Most of the lands to be used for the Project already \nbelong to the Louguantai Forest Farm. This has minimized the need to acquire collectively \nowned land. However, to preserve the forest resources, commercial ventures would only be \nlocated on the plains north of QBCDA. This necessitated the acquisition of some farmland for \nthe botanical gardens and some small parcels of land for SARC. The impacts on the Dianzhen \nvillage would be serious. For this reason, a land-shareholding agreement was proposed that \nwould allow these villagers to benefit directly from the Project. In total, the Project requires \npermanent land acquisition of 28.6 ha, of which 17.2 ha is farmland; this will cause partial land \nloss (50% on average) for 629 persons. The Project will require the displacement of only 143 \nhouses with 617 persons, who will be compensated and relocated nearby. An additional 3,780 \npersons will receive shareholding agreements for the lease of their farmland. \n \n7.  Legal Framework and Resettlement Principles. For people unavoidably affected, the \nresettlement objective is to achieve equal or better income and living standards in line not only \nwith  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  laws  and  regulations  but  also  the  Involuntary \nResettlement  Policy  (1995)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  PRC  laws  and \nregulations provide the legal basis for the Project, primarily the Land Administrative Law, the \nDecision on Reinforcing Reform in Land Administration (State Council [2004] No.28), and the \nPRC Ministry of Land Resources Guidelines on Improving Land Acquisition and Relocation \nRegulations (Document [2004] No. 238). In addition, Shaanxi province and Xi'an municipality \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of China for Preparing the Dryland Farming in the \n  Northern Region Project. Manila (TA 4631-PRC). \n ", "Appendix 14        59 \nhave formulated related documents for implementing the new regulations. All these documents \nhave provided the essential policy and procedural basis contained in the resettlement plans. For \nthis Project, the following resettlement principles were adopted:  \n(i)  involuntary resettlement should be avoided or minimized where feasible;  \n(ii)  compensation and entitlements provided for the affected persons should be able \nto at least maintain or improve their \u201cpre-project\u201d standard of living;  \n(iii)  no  matter  whether  they  have  legal  entitlements,  all  affected  persons  will be \ncompensated and assisted;  \n(iv)  where  land  per  capita,  after  land  acquisition,  is  not  sufficient  to  maintain \nlivelihood, compensation by cash or through land replacement and other income-\ngenerating activities will be provided for;  \n(v)  all  affected  persons  will  be  adequately  informed  on  eligibility,  compensation \nmode and standards, livelihood and income restoration plans, and project timing, \nand will be involved in resettlement plan implementation;  \n(vi)  no  land  acquisition  will  take  place  unless  replacement  land  or  sufficient \ncompensation are given to affected persons;  \n(vii)  the Executing Agency and an independent third party will monitor compensation \nand resettlement operations; \n(viii)  vulnerable groups will receive special assistance to ensure they are better off;  \n(ix)  all affected persons should have the opportunities to benefit from the Project;  \n(x)  resettlement  plans  should  be  combined  with  overall  county  and  township \nplanning; and \n(xi)  implementing agencies should provide adequate and timely funds, including any \nobligations in excess of the resettlement plan budget estimates. \n \n8.  Compensation  and  Rehabilitation  Plans.  Land  compensation  will  be  paid  to  the \naffected village and/or affected persons, and the resettlement subsidy and other compensation \nfor individual asset loss will be paid to the affected persons. Villagers who lease their lands will \nreceive annual payments from QNBG for the 50-year lease period. Households to be relocated \nwill receive compensation at replacement cost for the lost structures and attachments without \nconsideration of depreciation. The affected household can rebuild their houses by themselves \nwith free house plots provided by the village. Affected persons can salvage the structural \nmaterials, and a moving subsidy will also be provided. The new section of the village for \nrelocating the 143 households has been designed based on modern standards with good \nstreets, water supply, drainage, electricity, and communication lines. The local government will \ncontribute funds for village infrastructure. The detailed programs of restoration and relocation \nhave been set out in each resettlement plan to mitigate the resettlement impacts for affected \npersons  and  to  restore  their  living  standards  according  to  the  economic  characteristics  of \naffected villages. People can choose the options according to their own requirements. The \nProject will not have any impacts on ethnic minorities. Any affected persons will be identified \nand provided preferential treatment to ensure their rehabilitation. Assistance measures include \nprovision of training and employment for project construction and operation (including 50% \nwomen), and other employment information for jobs in the area.  \n \n9.  Resettlement  Costs  and  Funding.  The  estimated  cost  for  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement is about CNY38.04 million, including contingencies and land taxes. In addition, \nQNBG will make annual payments for 50 years ranging from CNY1.5 million in 2011 to CNY4.4 \nmillion in 2025 for leasing the land from Dianzhen village. Detailed measurement surveys will be \nconducted in each village, and the compensation contracts will be negotiated and signed with \nvillage committees, households, and enterprises. The resettlement costs are included as part of \ntotal project cost and will be funded by QNBG and guaranteed by the Shaanxi provincial \n ", "60  Appendix 14 \ngovernment. Affected persons have been informed about the key elements of land acquisition \nand resettlement through consultation during the planning stage and distribution of resettlement \ninformation booklets. During meetings, interviews, focus group discussions, public consultation \nworkshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  local  representatives  participated  in  the \nplanning, and concerns were integrated into the resettlement plans.  \n \n10.  Resettlement Implementation and Monitoring. The project management office (PMO) \nis responsible for overall coordination of resettlement planning, supervision, monitoring, and \nreporting.  QNBG  will  establish  a  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  unit  for  supervising \nimplementation,  continuing  public  consultation,  responding  to  grievances,  and  reporting \nprogress. The main responsibility for administration of land acquisition, compensation, and \nresettlement  is  Zhouzhi  County.  The  grievance  redress  procedures  are  set  out  in  the \nresettlement plans. The resettlement implementation schedules were prepared based on the \nfeasibility study and construction timetable. Internal and external monitoring of resettlement \nimplementation  will  be  required.  QNBG  and  the  PMO  will  handle  internal  supervision  and \nmonitoring to ensure compliance with the provisions of the resettlement plan. The PMO will \nengage an independent agency, acceptable to ADB, for external monitoring and evaluation. The \ndetailed requirements and terms of reference for external resettlement monitoring are stipulated \nin the resettlement plans. External monitoring reports will be forwarded directly to the PMO and \nADB, and will be uploaded to the ADB website. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20091001134239+08'00'", "Subject": "Proposed Loan and Administration of Grant", "Author": "tcb", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "shaanxi qinling biodiversity conservation, global environment facility, shaanxi province china, prc biodiversity conservation projects, prc globally-significant species protection, biodiversity management improvement, adb project 39321", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20091027155604+08'00'", "Title": "Shaanxi Qinling Biodiversity Conservation and Demonstration Project "}}
