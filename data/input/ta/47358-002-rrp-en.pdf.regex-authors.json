", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Independent State of Samoa for the Enhancing Safety, Security, and Sustainability of Apia \nPort Project. \n \n2.  The project will improve the efficiency, safety, and environmental sustainability of the \nseaport in Apia, Samoa. It will upgrade terminal infrastructure to enhance safety and capacity, \nstrengthen existing breakwater to enhance resilience to climate change and severe storms, and \nconstruct a customs facility with a new container x-ray scanner to enable effective border \nmanagement. The project will also support gender-sensitive green port initiatives (GPIs) to \npromote clean and sustainable port operations and management. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Regional context and maritime transport challenges. Samoa lies south of the equator, \nabout halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand, in the Polynesian region of the Pacific Ocean. \nIt has a population of about 200,000, an estimated nominal domestic product of $835.8 million in \n2018, and a land area of 2,820 square kilometers, which consists of the two large islands of Upolu \nand Savai\u2019i as well as eight small islets.1 The main island of Upolu is home to nearly three-quarters \nof Samoa\u2019s population, and to the capital city, Apia. Given the geographical isolation from major \ninternational markets, maritime connectivity is critical to the economy, which heavily depends on \nagricultural exports, and imports of basic commodities. \n \n4.  The port is the country\u2019s only international maritime gateway. It was first constructed with \nNew Zealand grant aid in 1966. Between 1988 and 2015, the Government of Japan provided \nassistance for various port improvements, such as construction of the original breakwater in 1988, \nrehabilitation after cyclone damage in 1992, and wharf extension to accommodate cruise liners in \n2015. In  2018,  the  port  handled  37,091  twenty-foot  equivalent  units  (TEUs)  of  containers, \nincluding 4,470 TEUs for transshipment and 15 cruise liners. By 2035, the container demand is \nprojected to increase to 51,534 TEUs, including 5,153 TEUs for transshipment and 20 cruise \nliners. Although the port has sufficient berth capacity, the capacity of its terminal is inadequate, \none tugboat is past its design life, and the breakwater is so damaged that it is inadequate to \nwithstand climate change impacts and natural disasters. Trade facilitation is suboptimal because \nthe customs processing system is inefficient. Moreover, coordinated efforts at the port to tackle \nenvironmental  issues  for  long-term  sustainability  are  lacking.  The  proposed  project  will \ncomplement earlier donor efforts in four main areas. \n \n5.  Safety  and  capacity.  Technical  assessments  estimated  that  1.9  hectares  of  gross \ncontainer terminal area are required to meet projected container demand by 2035. The current \neffective gross container terminal area is only 1.4 hectares because of leases to non-port \nactivities, the container-handling flow is inefficient because of damaged areas within the port \nterminal, and the location of utilities is suboptimal. The project will repair the damaged areas of \nthe wharf deck, upgrade the lighting, provide suitable pavement and additional reefer container \ncapacity, and reconfigure the layout of the container terminal for greater efficiency. \n \n6.  Currently, the vessels calling at the port are served by two tugboats (Tafola and Atafa) \nthat are insufficiently powered to meet even current requirements. Tafola is past its design life \n(30 years) and poses navigational safety concerns. Atafa has up to 5 years left in its design life, \n                                                \n1  Samoa Bureau of Statistics. 2019. http://www.sbs.gov.ws  \n \n ", "2 \nafter which a replacement would be needed. Ideally, two higher-powered tugboats should replace \nboth vessels. However, due to funding constraints, a phased approach will be taken to first replace \nTafola under the project.2 \n \n7.  Port operations are also constrained by seasonal waves entering the harbor basin during \nthe wet season (November\u2013April), which makes berthing unsafe.3 The project will implement a \nwave-monitoring system and develop an early-warning system to enhance navigation safety at \nthe port. \n \n8.  Resilience to climate change and natural disasters. Samoa has historically suffered \nfrom disasters triggered by cyclones, earthquakes, and associated tsunamis. The breakwater at \nthe port is currently damaged, and wave modeling revealed that it will suffer severe damage \nduring a 100-year storm event.4 It is essential to enhance the resilience of the breakwater to \nprotect the port and enable it to operate in the aftermath of disasters to receive vessels carrying \naid and emergency supplies. The project will rehabilitate and upgrade the existing breakwater to \nwithstand the 100-year design storm condition and a 50-year sea level rise. It will also implement \nnon-structural  measures,  such  as  formulating  a  multihazard  disaster  preparedness  plan \n(MHDPP), to mitigate disruption of port operations in the aftermath of a disaster event. \n \n9.  Border security and trade facilitation. Currently, customs examination at the port \ninvolves manual inspection of containers in an open area with limited space. Smuggling of illicit \ndrugs  and  weapons  through  sophisticated  concealment  is  a  growing  concern.  Catering  to \nincreasing trade through the port would require enhanced border security and trade facilitation.5 \nSamoa\u2019s Customs Legislation requires introduction of a non-intrusive inspection equipment as a \ntool to streamline and strengthen border security. The project will provide a new container x-ray \nscanner and related facilities. The Government of New Zealand is currently providing long-term \nsupport to the Ministry for Revenue (MFR) to develop capacity-building programs on border \ncontrol. Once the new container x-ray scanner is in place, the Government of New Zealand would \nsupport  MFR in implementing a modern risk-based, intelligent customs management system as \npart of its ongoing capacity development program. \n \n10.  Gender-sensitive green port. At present, there is a lack of coordinated effort at the port \nto manage the environment and optimize operational and energy efficiency. This undermines the \nlong-term sustainability of port operations. The project will develop a green port policy (GPP) and \npilot GPIs to promote more environmentally sustainable practices at Samoa Ports Authority \n(SPA). This will be developed based on an audit of SPA\u2019s performance against green port \nindicators from international best practice and maritime conventions (footnote 3). It will also \ninclude gender analyses to ensure that the GPP and GPIs address any particular impacts of port \noperations on women communities. Further, the project will promote greater participation of \nwomen employees in SPA\u2019s technical management roles to operationalize the GPP and GPIs, by \nproviding  training  opportunities  on  state-of-the-art  environmental  management  practices. \nCollectively, this is well aligned with the government\u2019s vision in the Samoa Transport Sector Plan \n(2014\u20132019) of delivering sustainable transport networks that support Samoa\u2019s economic and \nsocial development and enhance the quality of life for all Samoans. \n \n                                                \n2  Atafa will be considered for replacement as soon as other funds are identified. \n3  A feasibility study was conducted, and a preliminary green port concept developed, under Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). 2015.

Maritime transport projects in the Pacific often face start-\nup delays and cost overruns, or issues with the detailed design and procurement. To improve \nproject readiness and reduce the risk of cost overrun, the detailed design and the preparation of \nthe main civil works package are currently underway and expected to be completed by the fourth \nquarter of 2019. An independent peer reviewer (IPR) was engaged to review and ensure the \nrobustness of the design.6 The cost estimates allow for an adequate level of physical contingency. \nConstruction was assumed to take place over two seasons to account for possible interruptions \nduring the wet season. \n \n12.  Sustainable Infrastructure and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. The GPIs to be piloted under the \nproject are aligned with ADB\u2019s commitment to support the protection and restoration of marine \necosystems and improve the sustainability of port infrastructure development (para. 10). It can \nserve as demonstration project, to be replicated for greater benefits to other developing countries \nin the Pacific.

Output 2: Preparedness and resilience of port operations to climate change and \nnatural hazards enhanced. The project will reconstruct the damaged breakwater by reshaping \nthe existing core, replacing the quarry layer and rock underfill, and replacing the existing units \nwith larger, 48-ton units. This will increase the breakwater height by 2.5 meters and the width by \n32 meters. An MHDPP for Apia Port will be delivered, covering seismic and extreme storm events. \n \n16.  Output 3: Border security and trade facilitation capacity enhanced. The project will \nprocure a new container x-ray scanner. It will also construct a new customs examination facility, \nwhich will accommodate the new container x-ray scanner. \n \n17.  Output 4: Gender-sensitive green port initiatives piloted. The project will deliver a \ngender-sensitive GPP and will pilot at least three gender-sensitive GPIs. Green port practices will \nbe mainstreamed into the SPA operations (para. 10). \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n18.  The project is estimated to cost $75.03 million (Table 2). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are in the project administration manual (PAM).11 The civil \nworks for the ports represent the major expenditure under the project. \n \nTable 2: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem    Cost \nA.

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $62.26 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. The summary financing \nplan is in Table 3. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to civil works, equipment, \nconsulting services for construction supervision and GPIs, and individual consultants to support \nthe project management unit (PMU). The government will finance recurrent costs of the x-ray \nscanner and tugboat, taxes and duties, and contingencies. The government has given assurances \nthat it will mobilize funding resources should there be any shortfall in ADB financing.  \n                                                \n11 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nTable 3: Summary Financing Plan \n  Amount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nSpecial Funds resources (ADF grant)  14.79  19.7 \nSpecial Funds resources (ADF DRR financing)  7.47  10.0 \nSpecial Funds resources (Concessional Resources Regional Pool)  40.0  53.3 \nGovernment of Samoa  12.77  17.0 \n    Total  75.03  100.0 \nADF = Asian Development Fund, DRR = disaster risk reduction.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.   \n \n20.  The costs of disaster risk reduction (DRR) measures to enhance the disaster resilience of \nthe breakwater are estimated at $22.8 million. Since the DRR activities address climate-related \ndisaster risks and considered the impacts of climate change on extreme weather events, the DRR \nactions also contribute wholly to climate change adaptation, of which 100% is funded by ADB.12 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency, and the implementing \nagencies will be SPA and the MFR. MOF will provide overall oversight and coordination through \nits project steering committee. SPA will lead the PMU in day-to-day project management in line \nwith ADB\u2019s guidelines and in coordination with the project steering committee. SPA will procure \nthe civil works and consulting contracts, and SPA and the MFR will procure the equipment, in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and \nGuidelines for the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursement under \nthe grant will follow ADB\u2019s Loan and Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to \ntime). SPA and the MFR will ensure compliance in timely submission of audited project financial \nstatements to ADB. \n \n22.  Subject to satisfactory performance, availability of suitably qualified and experienced staff, \nand receipt of an acceptable proposal, the executing agency will directly contract, via single-\nsource selection, Beca International Consultants Ltd to provide construction supervision services \nfor the project, as further described in the PAM.13  \n \n23.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe PAM. \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspect  Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2019\u2013September 2023 \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2023 \nEstimated grant closing date  31 March 2024 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project steering committee \nChief Executive Officer, MOF (chair) \nSPA, MFR, MWTI, MPE, MFAT, MNRE, MOP, SSC, ADB \n(ii)  Executing agency  MOF \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  SPA and MFR \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  3 contracts  $53.5 million \n                                                \n12 The incremental DRR cost is derived from the total cost of reconstructing the breakwater to higher climate and \ndisaster resilience standards, less the estimated cost of basic repairs to the existing standard.

The project will provide additional consultants to supplement the PMU throughout the \nconstruction period. This includes a project implementation consultant, project manager, and a \nsocial safeguards and gender expert. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  The design to rehabilitate the damaged breakwater is the most cost-effective, is supported \nby the IPR, and takes into consideration a 50-year sea level rise (0.4 meter) and the 100-year \nextreme storm event. The reconstruction of the breakwater will take place in at least two phases \nto avoid the wet season. The risk of damage to the breakwater under extreme seismic events was \nassessed.  Both  the  detailed  design  consultant  and  the  IPR  concluded  that  it  would  be \nuneconomical and impractical to fully mitigate the seismic risks using structural measures.14 The \nproject team will develop alternative nonstructural measures, such as an MHDPP. On the \nlandside, repairs will be done to various damaged sections of the wharf deck, the fuel line, and \nelectrical duct lids. The lighting will be upgraded to provide safe operating standards. New reefer \nfacilities will be provided to meet the forecast requirements. The design also includes new \nstormwater drainage and three classes of heavy-duty pavement to ensure cost-effectiveness \nwhile maintaining operational flexibility. The container terminal layout will be reconfigured with \nnew fencing, to enhance safety and efficiency. For efficiency, the port component and the small \ncivil works to construct the customs examination facility will be packaged as a single civil works \npackage. \n \n26.  For the trade facilitation component, the project will finance the procurement of a container \nx-ray  scanner  that  meets  the  minimum  regulatory  standards  set  by  the  World  Customs \nOrganization. The supply contract for the container x-ray scanner will include a 2-year warranty \nperiod and the provision of training, and the government will finance a 5-year maintenance \ncontract with the supplier after the end of the warranty. To avoid potential damage from outdoor \noperations, a new customs examination facility will be constructed to house the new scanner \noperations. \n \n27.  The level of project readiness is high, since the detailed designs of the breakwater, port \nterminal, and the new customs examination facility are at an advanced stage, funded by the \nproject design advance facility. The bidding documents for the equipment and civil works are \nexpected to be ready in the early fourth quarter of 2019. \n                                                \n14 The IPR was engaged under the project design advance facility. \n ", "7 \n28.  The 30-year old tugboat (Tafola) has exceeded its operational lifespan and needs to be \nreplaced as soon as possible. Currently, it is operating on only one of its two engines, and steel \ncorrosion is evident throughout the vessel. Any repairs would be costly and provide limited \nextension to its service life. The tugboat supply contract will include a 2-year warranty period and \nthe provision of training, and the government will finance a 5-year maintenance contract with the \nsupplier after the end of the warranty. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n29.  The project will allow SPA and the MFR to ensure that basic operating needs are met and \nthat the movement of people and goods across Samoa\u2019s border is safe and secure. Improved \nmaritime infrastructure will ensure that the port is resilient to climate change and can remain \noperational in the aftermath of disasters triggered by natural hazards such as cyclones. \n \n30.  To assess the project\u2019s economic viability, standard cost\u2013benefit analysis is inapplicable \nbecause of the basic-needs nature of the components. Significant benefits arise from safety, \nsecurity, and resilience to climate change and natural hazards, which cannot be fully quantified \nfor comparison with investment costs since substantial damage is expected if the breakwater \nwere to be damaged. The potential damages would severely impact shipping lines and the \neconomy since Apia Port is the primary international gateway and serves as economic lifeline to \nSamoa. The potential breach of safety if vessel navigation took place without operational tugboats \ncould result in devastating impacts on passenger and cargo vessels. For the customs component, \nit is necessary to bring Samoa\u2019s customs in line with minimum international standards by \nstrengthening border security. \n \n31.  A basic-needs perspective or one of basic public goods and services provision is more \napplicable since it considers that the without-project scenario would negatively impact livelihoods \nif the population were unable to import basic goods. The detailed scope of port components was \nverified and confirmed by the IPR as being the cost-effective. A cost-effectiveness analysis was \napplied to evaluate the project following ADB guidelines.15 The assessment confirms the need for \n(i) reconstruction of the breakwater instead of patch repair; (ii) essential deck and yard repairs \nand strengthening of pavements, including lighting, renewal of the electrical supply network, and \nprovision of sufficient standby generation; (iii) provision of the container x-ray scanner; and (iv) \nimmediate replacement of the tugboat that is past its design life. \n \n32.  A financial analysis and financial capacity assessment was undertaken following ADB \nguidelines.16 Although the port components was found to be financially unviable, and hence \nunattractive for private sector investment, the financial sustainability analysis confirms that the \nincome from overall port operations would be sufficient to cover recurring expenses for the \nmaintenance of the new infrastructure. However, the pre-mitigated financial sustainability risk was \nsubstantial because of the risk of inadequate spending on asset maintenance by SPA, and the \nMFR\u2019s reliance on government funding for maintenance of the new x-ray scanner, leading to \npossible degradation of the assets. Therefore, SPA and MFR have agreed to  the following \nmitigating measures: (i) assurances designed to require SPA to establish a separate reserve fund \nearmarked for maintenance of the assets provided under the project and (ii) assurances requiring \nthe MFR to implement cost recovery charges to cover the recurring  maintenance requirements \nof the new x-ray scanner and customs facilities. \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n ", "8 \nC.  Governance \n \n33.  The assessment of state-owned enterprise governance concluded that SPA\u2019s governance \nis  largely  consistent  with  international  best  practice.  Areas  of  strength  include  the  overall \ngovernance framework, board independence, strategy setting, and the role of the chief executive \nofficer. Since many of the reforms are recent, SPA and the government need to show sustained \ncommitment to implementing them effectively. The biggest challenge to SPA\u2019s governance comes \nfrom the overlapping oversight by two ministries and the cabinet, and the ambiguities this creates. \nSeparate technical assistance will be provided to support the legal reforms needed to solve this, \nand to develop a policy that better insures SPA against disasters triggered by natural hazards.17 \n \n34.  The financial management assessment concluded that SPA has adequate capacity to \nundertake the financial management of ADB-financed projects. Although this would be ADB\u2019s first \ninvestment project in the ports and customs subsectors of Samoa, SPA has completed its fourth \nport project financed by the Government of Japan since the 1990s. The pre-mitigated financial \nmanagement risk was assessed as substantial, mainly because of the lack of experience with \nADB-funded projects. The risk to financial management is mitigated by the fact that SPA has in-\nhouse staff with experience in ADB procedures. Also, the newly established PMU comprises \npermanent staff from both SPA and the MFR. The project will provide additional support from \nconsultants experienced in project implementation and safeguards. MOF, the executing agency, \nis experienced in handling several ongoing ADB and other donor-funded projects. MOF, SPA, \nand the MFR also received training on ADB\u2019s financial management requirements in the first \nquarter of 2019. \n \n35.  The project procurement risk assessment concluded that both SPA and the MFR have \nlimited  resources  and  experience  to  support  the  preparation,  procurement,  and  contract \nsupervision of development-partner-financed infrastructure projects. This risk is being mitigated \nby the ongoing project design advance, and will be further mitigated during project implementation \n(Table 4). Procurement and engagement of consulting services will be conducted in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and the Guidelines for \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n36.  Integrity due diligence on SPA identified no significant integrity risks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government, MOF, \nSPA, and the MFR. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described \nin the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n37.  Climate and disaster resilience of the lifeline port, and efficiencies delivered by customs \nreform will boost the competitiveness of trade, particularly Samoan exports. This will stimulate the \neconomy, generate local employment, and increase domestic and international trade. The tourism \nand construction industries would benefit as well and create more domestic jobs for both skilled \nand nonskilled labor. \n \n38.  The project is classified some gender elements. Proactive gender design features focus \nprimarily on upskilling and employment for women through (i) a gender audit of SPA to ensure \nmore gender-sensitive and responsive ways of working, and to encourage more women into the \nworkplace, particularly in technical and management positions; (ii) gender analysis and actions in \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2019.

Safeguards \n \n39.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.20 \n \n40.  Environment (category B). The environmental assessment identifies the impact from \nbreakwater reconstruction as loss of about 10,000 square meters of highly modified benthic \nhabitat of low ecological value; such impacts are considered minor. Impacts on the western reef \nor on the movement of turtles are not anticipated. Risks associated with the x-ray scanner will be \nmitigated by installing the equipment in a specially designed building with screens, and by training \nstaff. Provided the measures included in the environmental monitoring plan are implemented, the \nproject impacts are considered to be minor. The PAM details the institutional arrangements \nproposed to ensure the implementation of environmental safeguards during the project. \n \n41.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). No physical or economic displacement will result \nfrom the project. The project will be implemented within the existing port area, which belongs to \nSPA. Two existing private lessees in the port area will be affected due to termination and non-\nrenewal of their expired lease. SPA negotiated with the lessees in accordance with their existing \ncontract and the lessees will not experience significant impacts. The due diligence also confirmed \nthat no legacy issues exist that would require corrective actions on the site. All key stakeholders \nwere consulted and will continue to be consulted during implementation. \n \n42.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The port development is not expected to have any \nimpacts  on  indigenous  peoples  considered  as  distinct  and  vulnerable  because  of  their \nendogeneity. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n43.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nGovernance and financial management \nSPA\u2019s internal audit function does  As an interim measure, the audit committee will hold meetings with the head \nnot report directly to the audit  of internal audit, without management present, at least once a year. \ncommittee. \n                                                \n18 Examples may include the upskilling of women on state-of-the-art environmental practices in areas such as air and \nwater quality management. The GPP will also address the impact of, for example, marine, air, and noise pollution on \nwomen in the communities surrounding the port. Examples of gender aspects in the MHDPP may include increased \nleadership responsibilities and training opportunities for women; gender-sensitive early-warning systems, and \nassurance that information related to disasters is gender-sensitive and discussed with women in nearby communities; \ncollection of sex-disaggregated post-disaster data; and training on tackling gender-based violence and trafficking \nafter a disaster. \n19 New Zealand is currently supporting the MFR in developing capacity-building programs on border control; this will \nextend to building the capacity required for incorporating the x-ray scanner operations into the new risk-based \ncustoms management system. \n20 ADB.
