INTRODUCTION \n1.  In 2013, the Government of Kazakhstan asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide  policy  advice  to  develop  the  insurance  subsector.  Several  teleconferences  during \nDecember 2013\u2013April 2014 confirmed the scope of the technical assistance (TA), which is \nincluded in the country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016.1 Support for the subsector was \nprioritized  during  the  discussions  concerning  the  new  partnership  framework  agreement.2 \nDuring the 9\u201311 April 2014 fact-finding mission, the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK), the \ngovernment\u2019s executing agency, confirmed with ADB the proposed impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.3 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In 2013, Kazakhstan had an insurance market penetration of 0.8% of the country\u2019s gross \ndomestic  product,  which  is  low  compared  with  the  global  average  of  6.3%  and  emerging \nmarkets average of 3.0%. Insurance spending per capita is also low\u2014in 2013, the insurance \ndensity  rate  equaled  $101  per  capita,  compared  with  the  global  average  of  $652.4 Most \ninsurance activity is limited to urban areas, concentrated around Astana and Almaty. Although \nthe subsector is small, it has been growing significantly, with total assets of T521 billion ($3.4 \nbillion) in 2013. Premiums reached T253 billion ($1.4 billion) in 2013, a 20% increase from the \nend of 2012. Premium growth is associated with the government\u2019s health and pension reforms \nand a growing economy that has boosted per capita incomes and insurance demand. \n \n3.  The  country  has  34  licensed  insurance  companies  (including  7  life  insurers)  and  \n14 registered insurance brokers. The subsector is moderately concentrated, with the three \nlargest  companies  holding  40%  of  assets.  These  insurers,  however,  are  very  small  by \ninternational standards, and unable to benefit from economies of scale.5 Two of the insurers are \nstate-owned. Foreign insurers are practically nonexistent, with two insurers recently leaving the \nmarket. Due to their small market capitalization, insurance funds are insufficient to underwrite \nand they retain significant proportions of large corporate risk on their balance sheets. As a \nresult, almost 90% of the corporate risk is reinsured outside Kazakhstan. \n \n4.  Nonlife insurance dominates, with over 50% of the gross premium coming from voluntary \nnonlife insurance (including close to 20% from property insurance, which dominates the nonlife \nsegment).  Compulsory  insurance  includes  motor  third  party  liability  and  worker\u2019s  accident \ninsurance,  and  represents  less  than  25%  of  the  gross  written  premium.  Life  insurance  is \nrelatively  new  and  underdeveloped,  contributing  25%  of  gross  written  premium.  Creating \nattractive life insurance products has been a major challenge, as high inflation has reduced real \nreturns on investments. Inflation was 18.8% in 2007 but fell to a historically low 5.1% in 2012, \nincreasing slightly to 5.8% in 2013\u2014a level where consumers can be expected to increase their \ndemand for savings and insurance products. Demand for retirement annuity products has been \ngrowing. However, the relatively new life insurers have limited market experience to support \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: Kazakhstan, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n2  The Government of Kazakhstan signed a partnership framework agreement with ADB on 2 May 2014 to effectively \ncombine funds from the National Sovereign Wealth Fund with ADB resources to help meet 2030 national \ndevelopment goals. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 August 2014. \n4  Swiss Reinsurance Company. 2014. World Insurance in 2013: Steering Towards Recovery. Sigma 3. Zurich. \n5  Many are captive insurance companies, established with the specific objective of insuring risks emanating from \ntheir parent group. Sometimes they also insure the risks of the group\u2019s customers. \n ", "2 \n \ntheir mortality and underwriting assumptions and to build reserves. As a result, life insurers may \nunderestimate  insurance  risks  in  their  pursuit  of  short-term  profitability.  The  life  insurance \nsubsector is forecast to continue growing. \n \n5.  Despite Kazakhstan\u2019s vulnerability to earthquakes and floods, residential property is not \ninsured against natural disasters. Catastrophic insurance does not exist and most insurers have \nno reliable quantitative estimates of their peak risk exposure, leaving them financially vulnerable \nto catastrophic events. Few insurance companies buy catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance \nprotection, leaving them vulnerable to substantial losses if a reinsurer defaults. The introduction \nof a law on mandatory property insurance against all natural and man-made catastrophes is \ncurrently under discussion, and is a priority product for the government.6 \n \n6.  Reinsurance activity remains a key concern for the regulator given the significant share \nof reinsurance that takes place outside of Kazakhstan and the difficulty of monitoring these \nactivities. Without large local reinsurance companies, most risks are ceded to reinsurers outside \nof the country (mainly Russian and European companies).7 In many cases, the primary insurer \ncedes all, or virtually all, of the risk of loss to a reinsurer who also controls the underwriting \nand/or claim-handling process (fronting process). Similarly, Kazakhstan insurers accept inward \nreinsurance premiums from foreign companies on a reciprocal basis. Since foreign reinsurers \nare not licensed or monitored by Kazakh regulators, concerns focus on reinsurance placements \nwith  or  from  institutions  with  low  credit  quality  and  without  adequate  transparency.  The \nsupervisor  lacks  the  capacity  and  resources  to  monitor  ceding  company  transactions, \nparticularly for risks being reinsured through entities in offshore jurisdictions.8 New regulations \nwere introduced in 2012 to increase domestic risk retention. As of 1 October 2013, only 25.2% \nof the insurance premium was ceded by way of reinsurance to foreign insurers and reinsurers. \nRating requirements have also been increased for the placement of risk with foreign reinsurers.9 \nThe new requirements encourage domestic insurers to work with large reinsurers and increase \nthe domestic share of reinsurance, but concerns remain. \n \n7.  NBK is responsible for insurance regulation and supervision. Most of the regulations are \nmodeled on European Union directives. Consolidation of the insurance industry is under way, \nincluding tightening the prudential regulatory regime. Kazakhstan\u00b4s participation in a customs \nunion with Belarus and the Russian Federation, as well as the ratification of the protocol on the \ncreation of a single insurance market for the Eurasian Economic Community member countries, \nare driving forces for harmonization of insurance legislation and unification of insurance markets \nby 2019. Protocols and procedures for cross-border supervision of branches, subsidiaries, and \ninsurance intermediaries through supervisory colleges are likely to be established.10 This will \n                                                \n6  The World Bank is in discussions with the government to provide some support for risk definition, data collection, \nand modeling for a number of risks. \n7  As of October 2012, over 80% of risks were ceded to foreign reinsurers (NBK. 2013. Financial Stability Report. \nAlmaty). High risks in the oil and gas subsector, energy sector, and mining in Kazakhstan, which have the largest \nshare of collected insurance premiums, cannot be insured by domestic reinsurance companies because of their \ninsufficient solvency. For those risks, reinsurance by foreign companies with good financial soundness and \nsolvency is needed. \n8  The ceding company is an insurance company that passes part or all of its risks from its insurance policy portfolio \nto a reinsurance firm. \n9  In cases where the rating of a foreign reinsurer is lower than A, the domestic insurance company has to first \nexhaust local capacity by offering the risk to 10 local reinsurers and the balance, if not fully placed, can be placed \nwith a foreign insurer. \n10 In general, \u201csupervisory colleges\u201d refer to multilateral working groups of relevant supervisors formed for the \ncollective purpose of enhancing effective consolidated supervision of an international insurance group on an \nongoing basis. \n ", "3 \nhelp avoid the unintended consequences of regulatory arbitrage, while preserving the stability of \nthe insurance market. \n \n8.  The Financial Sector Development Strategy 2020 (approval expected at the end of \n2014) includes key strategic directions for developing the insurance subsector. The document \nhighlights,  among  others, the  need to (i)  improve  the  industry\u2019s  capitalization  and  stability \nthrough phased introduction of the Solvency II supervisory approach,11 (ii) improve the efficiency \nof reinsurance, (iii) streamline the list of compulsory schemes, and (iv) increase the availability \nof statistical insurance data and actuarial capacities to ensure adequate reserves. \n \n9.  The  insurance  subsector  has  growth  potential  but  faces  several  major  challenges. \nConstraints include (i) fragmented market structure, with many insurers not having the critical \nsize  to  build  adequate  risk  pools,  underwrite  contracts,  and  innovate;  (ii)  weaknesses  in \nregulation and supervisory capacity, and in consumer protection, which undermine confidence \nand trust, and the sound development of the market; (iii) grossly underdeveloped life insurance \nsubsector, dominated by annuities; (iv) catastrophic insurance, which is rarely sold or reinsured \nfor the risks taken; (v) limited availability of professionally qualified staff, including in insurance \ncompanies; and (vi) limited development of other segments of the finance sector allowing for \nlong-term investments, which results in insurance companies having difficulty finding profitable \nplacements  for  their  funds.  Key  development  issues  to  be  addressed  by  the  TA  include \nenhancing the regulatory framework and the capacity of the insurance supervisor and market \nparticipants.12 \n \n10.  Greater penetration of insurance services is fundamental to diversifying the Kazakh \nfinance sector, improving capital allocation and increasing the resilience of the finance sector to \neconomic shocks and uncertainty. Insurance growth will help with long-term financing for areas \nsuch as infrastructure. Through a better allocation and management of risks, a sound insurance \nsubsector will help increase economic and social welfare, by protecting individuals from risk and \nuncertainty. It improves the ability for risk-taking, further encouraging entrepreneurial decisions \nand longer-term larger investments, which stimulate economic growth.  \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be greater outreach of insurance achieved, as measured by insurance \npenetration and insurance density. The outcome will be a strengthened policy and regulatory \nframework for insurance supervision and product design, with NBK adopting at least three of the \nproposed changes for the regulatory framework by 2016. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  Output  1:  Risk-based  supervision  strengthened.  The  TA  will  assist  in  drafting \nregulations and related monitoring tools to strengthen the use of a risk-based supervision \napproach to ensure more efficient use of supervisory capacity. \n                                                \n11 Solvency II is a European Directive to harmonize the European Union insurance regulation. It is considered world-\nleading standards. Regulation focuses mainly on three areas: (i) new set of minimum capital requirements and \nvaluation techniques to reduce risk of insolvency, (ii) requirements for governance and risk management and \neffective insurance supervision, and (iii) disclosure and transparency requirements.  \n12 Under the partnership framework agreement, ADB, the government, and NBK are discussing additional work in the \ninsurance subsector to address the remaining constraints. \n ", "4 \n \n \n13.  Output 2: Reinsurance, and group and cross-border supervision improved. The TA \nwill  review  regulatory  and  market  practices  related to reinsurance  and  other forms  of  risk \ntransfer, and group and cross-border supervision. The TA will help draft and revise regulations \nand legal acts aligned with international standards, and establish protocols to cooperate and \nexchange information with other national supervisors. The TA will also support drafting of the \napplication  for  NBK  to  become  a  signatory  of  the  International  Association  of  Insurance \nSupervisors multilateral memorandum of understanding.13 \n \n14.  Output 3: National Bank of Kazakhstan staff capacity to regulate and supervise \nthe insurance subsector improved. The TA will support training and workshops to strengthen \nskills  in  prudential  supervision  (off-site  and  on-site)  with  specific  reference  to  solvency, \nreinsurance (including dealing with entities in offshore jurisdictions), cross-border supervision of \ninsurance  and  reinsurance  entities  and  intermediaries,  investments,  and  measures  against \nmoney laundering and the financing of terrorism. The TA will assist in developing manuals and \nguidelines for these areas, including risk indicators and early warning systems. \n \n15.  Output 4: Actuarial database for insurance product design strengthened. The TA \nwill provide assistance to improve the regulatory model for compulsory insurance products, \nreview  premiums,  assess  the  appropriateness  of  statistical  databases,  and  provide \nrecommendations based on international best practice. The TA will provide support to the \nSociety of Actuaries of Kazakhstan to update mortality and disability tables. \n \n16.  Key assumptions include (i) the demand for insurance products will increase in line with \nincreased  quality  of  the  insurance  subsector;  (ii)  the  government  remains  committed  to \ninsurance reforms and implements reforms prioritized to improve market development; and  \n(iii) regulators, insurance companies, and other key stakeholders interact regularly to discuss \nmarket  developments.  Risks  include  concerns  that  deterioration  of  the  external  or \nmacroeconomic environment may delay reforms and public interest in insurance. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $940,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and $500,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund.14 The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space, \nvenues for workshops, translation, logistics support, and other in-kind contributions. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will be implemented from December 2014 to November 2016. NBK will be the \nexecuting agency and will appoint a TA coordinator.  ADB\u2019s Public Management, Financial \nSector and Trade Division of the Central and West Asia Department will administer the TA. The \nTA will require 34 person-months of consulting services\u2014three international consultants for a \n                                                \n13 The International Association of Insurance Supervisors multilateral memorandum of understanding establishes a \nformal basis for cooperation and information exchange among the signatory jurisdictions regarding the supervision \nof insurance and reinsurance companies and insurance groups where cross-border aspects arise. This includes \nrequesting and providing information on operation of insurance companies supervised by all signatory authorities \nhaving legitimate interests. \n14  To be disbursed on a front-loading basis. Established by ADB. Financing partner: the Government of Luxembourg. \n ", "5 \ntotal of 12 person-months, and two national consultants for 22 person-months. The consultants \nwill be recruited as individual consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). ADB will engage a team of individual \nconsultants rather than a firm as this will facilitate (i) faster mobilization of consultants, (ii) \ngreater ADB staff control in selecting and managing individual consultants, and (iii) greater \nflexibility in engaging experts specializing in international regulatory best practices on insurance. \nThe consultants will have expertise in insurance regulation and supervision, and actuarial work. \nThe  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference  are  in  Appendix  3.  Disbursements  will  be  made  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n19.  The TA activities will be monitored through regular consultations, including inception and \nreview  missions,  and  tripartite  meetings  with  relevant  stakeholders.  Activities  will  also  be \nmonitored through periodic reporting from consultants, including monitoring of outputs, activities, \nand  indicators  listed  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework.  Consultant  reports  will  be \npresented in workshops and seminars organized for the validation of findings. Reports will be \nmade available on the ADB website and published, if warranted. An evaluation of performance \nand outcomes will be carried out at the end of the TA and reflected in a TA completion report. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Kazakhstan for Enhancing Insurance Market Efficiency and Outreach, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nGreater outreach of  Insurance penetration  NBK annual reports  Demand for insurance \ninsurance achieved   increased to 1.2% of gross  Insurance company  products will increase in \ndomestic product by 2019  reports  line with increased \n(baseline 2013: 0.8%)    quality of insurance \nInsurance density  Sigma World Insurance  subsector. \nincreased to $120 per  Report (Swiss Re)  Risk \ncapita by 2019 (baseline  The external or \n2013: $101)  macroeconomic \nenvironment \n   \ndeteriorates, delaying \n    reforms and public \ninterest in insurance. \nOutcome      Assumption \nStrengthened policy  NBK adopted at least three  NBK policy and  The government \nand regulatory  of the proposed regulatory  regulatory documents  remains committed to \nframework for  changes by November  continuing its insurance \ninsurance supervision  2016  reforms. \nand product design \nOutputs      Assumption \ni.  1.
