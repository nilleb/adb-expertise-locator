INTRODUCTION \n1.  At the request of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) included policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) for a Performance Evaluation \nModel for the Urban and Rural Subsistence Security System in the TA program for the PRC \nduring the country programming mission in November 2011. ADB approved the TA concept \npaper on 7 May 2012 and undertook a fact-finding mission later that month, reaching agreement \nwith  the  government  regarding  the  TA\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  terms  of  reference  for \nconsulting  services, cost  estimates, financing  plan,  and  implementation  arrangements. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Market-oriented economic reforms after 1978 have significantly improved the economic \nwelfare of many people in the PRC. The PRC\u2019s social protection system has tried to keep pace \nwith these changes and address the evolving social welfare needs generated by rapid reform. \nDuring the earliest years of economic reform, the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MOCA) provided \nsocial relief support to rural residents who lacked labor capacity and lived in dire poverty. \nHowever, as economic restructuring, urban growth, and migration accelerated, new forms of \npoverty emerged in urban areas. Those affected included retrenched state enterprise workers \nwithout social insurance entitlements and unemployed rural\u2013urban migrants. In response, some \ncivil affairs agencies in the coastal and industrial cities of  Dalian and Shanghai pioneered \ninnovations for minimum living standard support. In the late 1990s, these pilot city schemes \nreceived national recognition as part of the national government\u2019s effort to expand the urban \nsocial protection system. \n \n3.  Dibao (a national minimum living standard guarantee scheme) was introduced in all \nurban areas in 1999. Each locality calculated its poverty line in accordance with its local fiscal \ncapacity. Local civil affairs staff then identified households below the line based on means-\ntested per capita household wage and nonwage income to receive dibao cash transfers that \ncould raise their incomes to the poverty line. The scheme expanded from covering 2.8 million \npeople in 1999 to 23.1 million in 2010, easing the worst effects of urban poverty. Its initial \nsuccesses led to the adoption of a similar subsistence guarantee approach in rural areas \nbeginning  in  2007.  By  July  2011,  the  rural  dibao  program  covered  52.2  million  people, \nsupported with funds from national and local governments. \n \n4.  The performance of the social protection system can be further enhanced by rectifying \nexclusion and leakage issues.2 Dibao cash transfers remain low, and the scheme\u2019s coverage \nand effectiveness are hampered by ineffective targeting mechanisms with significant leaks to \nthe nonpoor. As a result, while the scheme has decreased the intensity of poverty, it has not \nreduced  poverty  as  much  as  expected.  This  is  explained  by  two  exclusionary  factors:  (i) \neligibility criteria are not directly determined in accordance with surveys, and (ii) means-tested \ntargeting remains ineffective. Studies suggest that only 28%\u201351% of dibao-eligible families have \nbeen benefited from the scheme, and those on average received only a quarter of the amount to \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 May 2012. \n2  World Bank studies have documented both exclusion and leakage issues in World Bank. 2007.

The  highlighted  problems  reflect  a  need  to  improve  the  targeting,  indexing,  and \nperformance evaluation mechanisms. A dibao management information system (MIS) is needed \nto address (i) public and agency confidence in system efficiency and transparency, (ii) user \nsatisfaction levels, and (iii) greater social and economic inclusion of vulnerable groups. More \neffective  targeting  of  individual  dibao  recipients  will  require  more  accurate  methods  for \nassessing incomes, particularly those derived from multiple activities and locations or from \ninformal sources. Some earlier dibao pilots explored community-based assessment methods as \na means to increase targeting accuracy, transparency, coverage, and social assessment of \ndibao  provision.  These  pilots  included  activities  involving  local  civil  society  or  nonprofit \norganizations (NPOs) and individual dibao recipients, in addition to trained local MOCA staff.4 \nFrom the early 2000\u2019s, support for government contracting of social services to NPOs has been \nincreasing, and this model of dibao system innovation should be explored further. However, \nbefore this can occur, local MOCA staff will require guidelines and training on MIS use and NPO \ncontracting. \n \n6.  The development of a more effective targeting system will be essential to address the \nweaknesses of the dibao system. The introduction of a dedicated MIS will adequately respond \nto the challenges; in several countries where a similar MIS was introduced, coverage increased \nto up to 80% of eligible families. Better targeting will be especially crucial in light of the 2012 \nincrease in the rural poverty line, which has raised the number of rural people classified as poor \nby 100 million. Moreover, the TA will contribute to the implementation of the guidelines in the \n12th Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015, which call for significant upward adjustment in the dibao \nsystem. \n \n7.  The TA directly supports the strategic goals of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) \nfor the PRC, 2011\u20132015.5 The CPS calls for strengthening the social inclusion orientation of the \ncountry program and its social dimensions through promoting social services, such as social \nprotection, to meet economic and social development challenges. The TA also builds on the \nfindings of Urban Poverty Strategy Study II,6 Strengthening the Antipoverty Effects of Social \nAssistance,7 and the ongoing Building Equitable Opportunities into Social Assistance.8 The TA \non strengthening antipoverty effects explored local financing options and identified the need to \naddress performance monitoring through further applied research. \n \n                                                \n3  Q.

This district-level pilot became a Dalian city wide \npolicy initiative and was also replicated by 10 other cities.  \n5 ADB. 2012.

Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be improved efficiency, inclusiveness, and household-level \nimpact of the PRC urban and rural subsistence social protection system. The outcome of the TA \nwill be an improved method for dibao targeting and tracking, which can form the basis for further \ngovernment-funded testing, expansion, and refinement. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA outputs will be (i) a tested and documented MIS and performance evaluation  \nguidelines with criteria and indicators to improve the targeting of subsistence security subsidy \ndisbursements for urban and rural low-income households, and the tracking and monitoring of \noutcomes by government agencies and civil society partners developed and introduced in a \nbilingual  policy  note  and  other  internal  agency  recommendation  reports  that  outline  the \nstrengths of the MIS and performance evaluation guidelines and identify opportunities for wider \napplication; (ii) a documented pilot for better information provision and analysis, targeted and \nincentivized  urban  and  rural  dibao  recipients,  and  tracked  and  monitored  outcomes  by \ngovernment agencies and contracted NPOs; (iii) training materials and staff trained in the \nutilization  of  the  MIS  and  performance  evaluation  guidelines;  (iv)  a  pilot  NPO  contracting \nprocess  for  participatory  dibao  information  dissemination  and  analysis,  improved  recipient \ntargeting and incentivization, and tracked and monitored dibao provision and recipient trends; \nand  (v)  dissemination  of  TA  findings,  survey  data,  questionnaires,  and  other  research \ninstruments, as appropriate, in seminars and through other mechanisms.  \n \n10.  TA outputs will be developed through four linked and phased components. Component 1, \nlasting  6  months,  will  comprise  preparatory  research  to  (i)  review  rural  and  urban  dibao \nperformance evaluation procedures and practices through a desk survey, a multiprovince field \nsurvey and workshop; (ii) identify international best practices; and (iii) review initial findings; \nidentify initial survey sites, proposed methodologies, project teams, and anticipated outputs; and \n(iv) develop a draft dissemination and transparency strategy and present a draft report on dibao \nperformance evaluation in a multi-stakeholder workshop. \n \n11.  Component 2, lasting 16 months, will conduct a workshop and develop field-tested dibao \nMIS and performance evaluation guidelines that include criteria and indicators, and an indicator \nweighting methodology. It will also conduct a small pilot experiment in government contracting \nto  NPOs  for  improved  and  participatory  information  dissemination  and  analysis,  recipient \ntargeting,  monitoring  by  government  and  NPOs,  and  incentivization  to  enhance  the \ntransparency of dibao operation and targeting performance. \n \n12.  Component 3, lasting 15 months, will  (i) conduct a learning and documentation visit in \nseveral countries to analyze subsistence security system performance evaluation procedures \nand practices and present findings in a workshop; (ii) incorporate lessons into, and refine, the \ndraft MIS and performance evaluation guidelines; and (iii) prepare draft training materials for \nuse in the pilot locations. \n \n13.  Component 4, occurring during the same time period as component 3, will (i) train \nagency staff from field survey and pilot locations to assemble data and test the efficacy of the \ndraft MIS and performance evaluation guidelines; (ii) conduct a final workshop to review pilot \ntest results and finalize operational guidelines for the MIS, performance evaluation guidelines, \n ", "4   \nassociated training materials, and selection criteria and contracting processes for any future \nNPO participation in dibao information dissemination and analysis, targeting and incentivizing, \nand  tracking  and  monitoring  of  dibao  provision  and  recipient  trends;  (iii)  finalize  MIS  and \nperformance evaluation guidelines and associated findings, training materials in appropriate \nlanguages  for  dissemination;  (iv)  finalize  and  disseminate  TA  findings,  survey  data, \nquestionnaires, and other research instruments, as appropriate, in seminars and through other \nmechanisms;  and  (v)  conduct  a  dissemination  conference  on  findings  and  policy \nrecommendations,  including  for  wider  application  of  improved  MIS  and  pilot  performance \nevaluation guidelines. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).  \n \n15.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office, \noffice supplies, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 26 months from 1 August 2012 to 1 October 2014. \nMOCA will be the executing agency for the TA and its Department of Social Assistance (DSA) \nwill be the implementing agency. The DSA will designate a TA focal point and establish and \nchair a TA steering committee group to invite representatives from its related departments, as \nwell as from the State Council (the Legal Affairs Office, the Development Research Center, and \nthe Leading Group for Poverty Alleviation and Development); the Ministry of Labor and Social \nSecurity; the selected survey, pilot, and experiment localities; and relevant civil society service \nproviders and key national researchers in the field. Members of the TA steering committee will \nbe regularly consulted and invited to participate in TA activities. The steering committee will \nreview the inception and workshop reports, and participate in the final conference. \n \n17.  MOCA  will  provide  (i)  a  suitably  furnished  TA  office  with  computers,  utilities,  and \ntelecommunication access (including telephone, fax, and broadband internet connection); (ii) \nmaterials, maps, data, and documents as required under the TA; (iii) travel and monitoring costs \nfor government officials to visit action-research sites for periodic discussion of findings and to \nremunerate and provide per diems to counterpart staff; and (iv) the cost of office utilities for the \nconsultants. MOCA will designate a TA focal point with strong spoken and written English, and \nwill  facilitate  all TA  activities  and  links  to  local government  and  providers  to  support their \neffective implementation. \n \n18.  In  consultation  with  MOCA,  ADB  will  recruit  national  and  international  experts  as \nconsultants,  short-term  resource  persons,  and  task-specific  experts.  The  international  and \nnational consultants will be selected and engaged on an individual basis in accordance with \nADB\u2019s procedures for recruitment of individual consultants. Individual consultants will be chosen \nbased on their academic qualifications and relevant work experience. \n \n19.  ADB  will  establish  an  advanced  payment  facility  with  MOCA  to  facilitate  the  TA \nimplementation, subject to MOCA\u2019s capacity to complete the activity and liquidate the advance. \nThe proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n ", "  5 \n \n20.  A total of 23 person-months of individual consulting services (1 international consultant \nfor 2 person-months and 3 national consultants for a total of 21 person-months) will be required. \nTo promote full acceptance of the outcomes of the TA, the consultant team will be responsible \nfor  producing  the  TA  outputs  and  deliverables  in  a  timely  and  effective  manner  and  for \norganizing and carrying out all TA activities in close consultation with MOCA as the executing \nagency,  the  DSA  as  the  implementing  agency,  the  TA  steering  committee,  and  other \nresponsible provincial and local government departments and agencies. The outline terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n21.  TA support for workshops may include costs related to the venue, equipment rental, \ntranslation,  printing  and  copying,  food  and  nonalcoholic  beverages,  transportation,  lodging, \nlogistics and administrative support, and other agreed expenditures with prior agreement from \nADB. In line with standard ADB procedures, the TA will not support DSA\u2019s management fees or \nrelated costs such as staff salaries and allowances and the use of DSA resources (such as \noffice accommodation), which will be provided as part of the counterpart contribution. \n \n22.  Dissemination  of  research  findings  and  policy  suggestions  will  occur  through  (i)  a \nbilingual synthesis report comprising the main findings and policy recommendations, which will \noutline the strengths of the MIS, the performance evaluation guidelines, and the contracted \nNPO participatory pilot and opportunities for wider application; (ii) an associated bilingual policy \nnote summarizing the main recommendations of the TA for dissemination through government \nchannels and technical meetings; (iii) other internal agency recommendation reports outlining \nthe  strengths  of  the  MIS  and  the  performance  evaluation    guidelines,  and  identifying \nopportunities  for  wider  application;  (iv)  associated  seminars  and  publicity;  and  (v)  a  final \nconference and report that presents TA recommendations for MOCA and other national and \nlocal decision makers.
