INTRODUCTION\n1. The Government of Malaysia requested Bank technical assistance (TA) to prepare\nthe Daro-Mukah Coastal Zone Development Project in the State of Sarawak. A Bank TA Fact-\nfinding Mission visited Malaysia in September 1995 and reached an understanding with the\nGovernment on the objectives, scope, terms of reference (TOR) and implementation\narrangements of the proposed TA. The Mission confirmed that the proposed TA is accorded\nhigh priority by the Government and is consistent with the Bank's operational strategy for\nMalaysia. The TA is included in the 1995 Country Program for Malaysia'.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Daro-Mukah area, located along the west coast of Sarawak, is one of the least\ndeveloped regions of Malaysia. The Project area comprises approximately 625,000 hectares (ha)\nextending from Daro and the Batang Lebaan in the south to Mukah and Balingian Subdistrict in\nthe north. It extends inland to the Sibu-Bintulu Highway (see Map). It is located in the coastal\nareas of Sibu Division (Sibu, Dalat, Mukah Districts), with a small area (Daro District) in Sarikei\nDivision. It comprises a narrow (< 1 kilometer (km) wide) sandy coastal strip, extensive peat\nswamps (70 percent of the area) extending up to 30 km inland, narrow raised levees along both\nsides of the large rivers that dissect the area, and small areas of rolling land with strongly\nleached mineral soils adjacent to the Sibu-Bintulu highway.\n3. The major economic activities in the area are agriculture (sago, oil palm, pepper,\npaddy, coconut, and rubber) [60 percent], coastal fishing (25 percent), logging (10 percent), and\nmills (5 percent) processing sago, palm oil, and timber. Many of the agricultural and fishing\nactivities are for subsistence purposes or sale to small local markets. Indigenous forests\ncomprise about 50 percent of the area. 2 Peat swamp forest is the dominant forest type with\nsmall areas of mangrove forests and mixed dipterocarp hill forests on the rolling land. Areas\ndesignated as Permanent Forest Estate comprise 332,000 ha, of which 226,000 ha is designated\nas Protection Forest, 83,000 ha as Forest Reserves, and two areas (TG Bud  and Lassa-Matalau)\ncomprising 13,000 ha as Nature Reserves.\n4. Current fisheries activities are mainly small-scale prawn, terubok,3 jellyfish, and\ncrab fishing. Important prawn fisheries lie off the mouth of the Rajang River. Sibu and Mukah are\nthe major fishing centers and contain the main fisheries infrastructure including cold stores,\nfish/prawn processing and boat-building facilities. The Bank-funded Sabah/Sarawak Fisheries\nInfrastructure Development Project4 is located at Mukah.\n5. The Project area is one of high environmental sensitivity because of the large\nareas of wetland, swamp forest, shallow coastal water supply areas, fragile peat and sandy\ncoastal soils; risk of salt water incursion; and breeding areas for prawn and  terubok fisheries.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in May 1995.\n1\t Sarawak SPLl, Interagency Study Team Lower Rajang-Mukah Integrated Agricultural Development Project\nStudy, 1994.\n3\t A local species of herring.\n4\t Loan No. 563-MAL: Sabah/Sarawak Fisheries Infrastructure Project in the amount of $20.6 million, approved\nin December 1981 and closed in March 1991.", "2\nShifting cultivation occurs in about 14 percent of the area, mainly on rolling land near the Sibu-\nBintulu Highway.\n6. Approximately 60,000 people live in the project area. They are concentrated along\nthe coastal strip and the rivers. Mukah is the largest town with 12,000 people. Ethnic groups\ncomprise the Melanaus (65 percent), Iban (30 percent), and Chinese and Malays (<5 percent).\nThe Melanaus are mainly coastal fishermen and part-time farmers settled in villages along the\ncoast and rivers. The Iban live along the inland parts of the rivers and are mainly subsistence\nfarmers, practicing shifting cultivation.\n7. Household income is below the poverty level' in 30-50 percent of the population\nthroughout the area, with hard-core poverty levels of 3-9 percent 2. Poverty is highest among\nthe [ban. Out-migration (3.7 percent per year) of young people, particularly males, in search of\nemployment has resulted in a higher female/male ratio, creating a need for development\nactivities to focus on women's employment opportunities. Out-migration also limits the labor\nsupply for plantation or other agro-industry development in the area.\n8. High priority has been given to the development of the Daro-Mukah area in the\nGovernment's 6th and 7th Malaysia Plans. The state Government's strategy is to develop\ninfrastructure (roads, electrification, water supply, marketing, agricultural and fisheries\ninfrastructure, small-scale port development, drainage, and flood mitigation) to stimulate both\npublic and private sector investment in agricultural, fisheries, and forestry activities. Infrastructure\ninvestment scheduled for the 7th Malaysia Plan includes the construction of the remaining\nsections of the Bintulu-Daro coastal road, bridges, rural electrification, rural water supply, and\nprovision of other public services.\n9. A number of agricultural development schemes are ongoing or planned. These\ninclude 7,000 ha of drainage schemes under the Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID) for\npaddy and cash and tree crop (coconut, cocoa, rubber) production; and 27,000 ha of sago palm\nplantations on deep peat soils under the Land Custody and Development Authority of Malaysia\nand oil palm plantations under the Federal Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority and\nMuka Plantation Industries. A new industrial zone is also being developed at Mukah. The\nSarawak Fisheries Development Study3 has identified the continental shelf and river estuarine\nsystems of the Project area as having the potential for further development of prawn,  terubok,\njellyfish, crab fisheries, and fish processing activities.\n10. A private sector firm is currently undertaking a forest development plan that\nincludes the Project area. The German Technical Cooperation Agency (GTZ) is also preparing\na Forest Management Plan for Sarawak, including the Project area. The Danish Cooperation on\nEnvironment and Development has proposed a major coastal management project that includes\nSarawak, but final Federal Government approval is still pending.\nThe official poverty line for Sarawak (1993) is RM495 ($198) per month per household of 5 persons. The\nhard-core poverty line is RM248 ($99) per month.\nUniversiti Kebangsaan Malaysia \"Poverty Study of Selected Areas of Sarawak' December 1994.\nMinistry of Agriculture, 1994. \"Sarawak Fisheries Development Study\".", "3\n11. A number of diverse development projects, both from the public and the private\nsector, are in various stages of planning and implementation, and they need to be integrated into\na cohesive master plan with short-and long-term action programs. The proposed TA is\nenvisaged to undertake such integration and, further, to identify the priority areas for immediate\ndevelopment.\n12. The rationale for an investment Project is to raise the level of economic\ndevelopment of East Malaysia toward that achieved in Peninsular Malaysia, and to reduce the\npockets of poverty that still remain in East Malaysia. Given the low population density, limited\nlabor supply, environmental sensitivity, and range of ethnic groups, the Project will emphasize\nrural development planning and the protection of environmentally sensitive areas, followed by\nprovision of infrastructure as leverage to initiate economic development. In line with Government\nstrategies, commercial agricultural development will be left largely to private sector initiatives.\n13. The Government's objectives in developing the Project area are to (i) provide basic\ninfrastructure (road and water management structures) to facilitate development of the\nagricultural sector within the Project area; (ii) diversify the economic base and generate\nemployment opportunities to maximize income and improve the quality of life of the population;\n(iii) commercialize the existing traditional agriculture subsector to maximize farm productivity; (iv)\nlower the incidence of rural poverty; (v) manage local resources on a sustainable basis,\nespecially to reduce shifting cultivation practices; and (vi) ensure greater contribution of the\nProject area to the state economy.\n14. These objectives are consistent with the Bank's crosscutting concerns of reducing\npoverty, improving the status of women, and protecting the environment, and the Bank's\nstrategic objectives of capacity building and human resource development and\ncreating/strengthening productive capacity, infrastructure, and services. Environmental\nconsiderations and integrating women in development will be a key part of the Project design.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n15. The overall goal of the Project is to carry out environmentally sound economic\ndevelopment, particularly targeting poverty reduction in the Project area. The objectives of the\nTA are to: (i) formulate a framework master plan (FMP) for the coastal zone of the Daro-Mukah\narea, for the period 1996-2010; (ii) consolidate and harmonize the existing plans and programs\nto make them consistent with FMP; (iii) carry out a feasibility study for selected high-priority\nagriculture, fisheries, forestry and infrastructure subprojects; and (iv) prepare a cohesive project\nproposal for the design and implementation of subprojects. Details are given in the Project\nframework (Appendix 1).\n16. The objectives of the ensuing investment Project will be to (i) increase the income\nand employment opportunities of the target beneficiaries, particularly women; and (ii) reduce\npoverty among small farmers and fishermen. Its expected outputs are the (i) implementation of\nhigh-priority agricultural, fisheries, forestry and infrastructure development projects designed in\nthe feasibility study; (ii) strengthening of district planning and project management capacity; and\n(iii) facilitation of private sector investment in the Government's infrastructure development area.", "4\nB.\t Scope\n17. The TA will be conducted in two parts. In Phase 1 (6 months) a master plan for\nthe Project area including refined selection criteria for the subprojects will be prepared.' In\nPhase II (4 months) a feasibility study will be conducted to formulate a project that is acceptable\nto the Government and suitable for external financing. Phase I will (i) review previous and\nongoing studies in the Project area, including the prefeasibility study for the Lower Rajang-\nMukah Integrated Agriculture Development Project (IADP) carried out by the Government in\n1992; (ii) conduct a rapid rural appraisal and mobilize local communities to participate in and\ncontribute to the planning process; (iii) collect all relevant information on existing and proposed\ndevelopment plans and programs in the Project area; (iv) identify the key opportunities for and\nconstraints to private sector participation in the Project area; (v) formulate a long list of priority\nagriculture, fisheries, forestry, and infrastructure subprojects and conduct prefeasibility-level\nanalysis on such subprojects; (vi) prepare a draft master plan for the period 1996-2010;\n(vii) organize a workshop and finalize the plan after consultation and feedback from stakeholders\nand interested private sector entrepreneurs; and (viii) prepare an interim report with the results\nof the Master Plan, and recommendations to proceed with Phase 11, if feasible.\n18. Based on the findings in Phase I, Phase II will (i) prepare the feasibility studies on\nselected high-priority agriculture and infrastructure investment components or subprojects, which\ncould form the basis for a cohesive project package; (ii) conduct social and environmental\nimpact assessments of these components or subprojects; (iii) assess the institutional capability\nof the proposed implementing agencies, and formulate an institutional strengthening program,\nif required; (iv) identify Project linkages to all complementary programs particularly in the private\nsector; and (v) prepare a Project proposal containing sufficient information for consideration by\nthe Government and the Bank.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n19. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,200,000 equivalent, comprising\n$600,000 in foreign exchange cost and $600,000 in local currency equivalent (Appendix 2). It is\nproposed that the Bank provide a TA grant to cover the entire foreign exchange cost of\n$600,000. The local cost component for domestic consultants, counterpart services, office\nfacilities, secretarial support, surveys and studies, amounting to $600,000 equivalent, will be\nborne by the Government, out of which the equivalent of $165,000 covering the cost of the\ndomestic consultants will be executed under a separate contract between the Government and\nthe domestic consultants.\n20. Subject to the results of the TA study and based on available information, the\nestimated Project cost will be up to $100 million with a maximum of 40 percent of foreign\nexchange. It is currently envisaged that the Project will include agriculture, fisheries, forestry,\ninfrastructure, and capacity-building components, the details of which will be designed during\nPhase II of the TA. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit\nthe Bank to financing any ensuing Project.\nThe indicative selection criteria include minimum disturbance of the environment, maximum impact on\npoverty reduction and the ethnic groups, availability of labor and satisfactory financial and economic returns.", "5\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n21. The TA will be implemented over a period of 10 months. The Executing Agency\nfor the TA will be the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, while the Sarawak State Planning Unit\n(SPU), whose performance in implementing similar studies has been satisfactory, will be the\nimplementing agency. A Steering Committee responsible for providing guidance on policy and\ncoordination issues will be formed under the chairmanship of the Federal Economic Planning\nUnit, and a Technical Committee responsible for the technical aspects will be chaired by SPU.\nSPU will appoint a senior staff member as counterpart Liaison Officer for the TA. The\nGovernment will provide local counterpart liaison staff from relevant departments. At the end of\nPhase I, the implementing agencies for the proposed loan will be identified and will take a more\nsubstantive role in guiding and assisting the feasibility study in Phase Il. The TA will operate out\nof a Project site at Mukah (to be fully refurbished by the Government) and a suboffice at Daro.\n22. An international consulting firm will be engaged in accordance with the Bank's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to the Bank. The\ninternational consulting firm, in addition to other duties, will be responsible for the overall\nsupervision of eight domestic consultants to be engaged under a separate contract between the\nGovernment and such domestic consultants. It is anticipated that a total of 41 person-months -\n22 for five international experts and 19 for eight domestic experts - will be necessary to carry\nout the TA. The five international consultants will have expertise in the following fields; rural\ndevelopment planning, indigenous people/community development, economics/marketing,\nagriculture, and environment; while eight domestic consultants in the field of civil engineering,\nforest management, fisheries, rural sociology, tree crop, environment, livestock, and soil.\nAppendix 3 gives the detailed TOR for the TA. Appendix 4 gives an indicative staffing schedule.\nThe TA is scheduled to be completed in December 1996.\n23. The consultants will prepare an inception report within one and a half months after\nthe TA commencement, an interim report at the end of the sixth month of services, and a draft\nfinal report at the end of the tenth month. Tripartite meetings among the Government, the Bank,\nand the consultants will be held to discuss the inception, interim, and draft final reports. The final\nreport will be submitted within one month of the final tripartite meeting.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n24. The President, acting under the authority delegated to him by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of Malaysia\nin an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 for the purpose of the Daro-Mukah\nCoastal Zone Development Project, and hereby reports his action to the Board.", "Appendix 1\nMALAYSIA: TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nDARO-MUKAH COASTAL ZONE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Measurable Indicator Means of Important Assumptions\nVerification\n1.\t Sector/Area Goals\n(i)\t Average rural (i)\t National and (i)\t Environmentally\n1.1\t Increase rural incomes. household incomes state statistics sensitive and\nequal to at least the (ii)\t Baseline survey, economic\n1.2 Reduce remaining pockets national average by benefit development areas\nof poverty in the Project 2001. monitoring can be physically\narea.
