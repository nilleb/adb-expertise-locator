THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \nA.  Ensuing Project Rationale \n \n1.  The proposed loan will address the key issue of high cost of transport across Manila and \nmore specifically on the major transport corridor of the Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA), \nby  reducing  travel  time,  increasing  passenger  throughput;  improving  connectivity  between \ndifferent transport modes and the surroundings areas; and improving the ability of government to \nmanage and operate the various transport systems that run along EDSA in a more efficient and \neffective way. The indicative loan amount of $500 million will improve all major transport modes \nalong EDSA, Metro Rail Transport Line 3 (MRT-3), buses, and private vehicles, as well as improve \npedestrian facilities. The transaction technical assistance (TRTA) and proposed loan are included \nin the country operations and business plan.1  \n \n2.  Manila Traffic. The traffic conditions in Manila are deteriorating, resulting in economic \nloses and social costs to all. The government has developed an overarching plan to improve the \ntransport situation through both large infrastructure projects and system operations improvements. \nThe National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) is preparing the Roadmap for \nTransport Infrastructure Development for Greater Capital Region, with the help of the Government \nof Japan, which build on the previous five transport plans for the city. Key to the plan is the \ndevelopment of large infrastructure such as the Mega Metro Subway, commuter rail service, \nexpressway connections, and additional bridges across the rivers. The proposed loan is directly \naligned with the Manila transport plans and will augment the major infrastructure proposals \nthrough support for system management and operations improvement, notably along the main \ntransport corridor in the city. The assistance can address many of the challenges facing the city \ntransport system and the flexibility to adapt to the changing circumstances and priorities of the \ngovernment. \n \n3.  EDSA is the major transport corridor in the National Capital Region (NCR). The \ncorridor serves all main modes of transport and suffers severe congestion. The congestion is \ngetting worse, resulting in economic loss, social and gender exclusion, and deteriorating air \nquality and road safety. Urgent action is required to improve EDSA and reduce the cost of \ntransportation to allow continued and sustainable development of the city. \n \n4.  The economic engine of the Philippines. In 2016, NCR accounts for 36.6% of the \ncountry\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP).2 Congestion on EDSA is estimated to cost \u20b12.4 billion \na day.3 \n \n5.  The primarily transport corridor. EDSA serves as the main corridor for several sub-\nmodes: MRT-3, the highest volume transit line in the city;4 provincial buses (main route in and out \nof the city); city buses (busiest bus corridor in the city); and private vehicles (highest traffic volume \nin the city). EDSA is evolving as an urban clearway to serve large demand for travel. In addition, \nthis is currently the only high capacity road which links the expressway systems north and south \nof the city. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Philippines, 2017\u20132019. Manila. \n2  Philippine Statistics Authority. Database 2017. Manila. \n3  NEDA. 2014. Roadmap for Transport Infrastructure Development for Metro Manila and Its Surrounding Areas. Manila. \n4  MRT-3 is a 19.6 kilometer (km)-line with 13 stations, starting from North Avenue station in Quezon City and ending \nin Taft Avenue station in Pasay City. \n ", "  Appendix 3  17 \n6.  Inefficient use of road space. The current traffic volumes on EDSA at Guadalupe Bridge \nare 166,000 two-way passenger car unit per day. Th growth in traffic on EDSA has been limited \ndue to capacity restraint, it operates at or near to capacity for over 16 hours a day; traffic volume \nto capacity ratio is estimated to range from 0.8 to 1.1. There are 15,000 buses per day on EDSA \n(crossing Guadalupe Bridge) which currently operate at around 60%~70% of capacity, suggesting \nthere are too many buses for the bus demand. MRT-3 currently carries 400,000 passengers per \nday, and is operating at about 80% of its\u2019 current capacity and about 40% of its ultimate capacity. \nMRT-3 has capacity to carry around one million passengers per day with additional rolling stock \nand signal system improvements to increase travel speed and train frequency.  \n \n7.  Poor public transport facilities. EDSA has low standard transport facilitates, especially \nfor public transport users. The access and egress from MRT-3, light rail transit (LRT) 1, and bus \nstops and/or stations are of very low-quality. Also, the public transport interchange locations \nbetween EDSA and key cross routes are very poorly served. These poor facilities result in unsafe, \ninconvenient, difficult, and more expensive trips for public transport users. \n \n8.  Poor public transport integration. EDSA has the main metro systems, with MRT-3 and \nnorthern parts of LRT-1 running along the road. In addition, there are interchanges with the \nsouthern sections of LRT-1 and LRT-25 crosses EDSA in Cubao. The proposed Mega Manila \nSubway project will run parallel to EDSA for about 2/3 of its length, and must be included as part \nof any holistic solution for improving the overall transport system in the EDSA corridor. Historically, \nmany systems were planned in isolation, with limited dedicated interchange facilities provided, \nthus, reducing the overall benefits of the public transport system. \n \n9.  Poor traffic management and road operations. EDSA does not have a uniform number \nof lanes and the merging and diverging adds to the congestion. The U-turns, while banning left \nturns and thus removing the need for signalized junctions, add to travel distances and/or time and \nadd to overall congestion. EDSA also suffers from encroachment by economic enterprises along \nmuch of its length, dramatically reducing the capacity and operational efficiencies of the road. In \naddition, many vehicles \u2018stand-by\u2019 on EDSA, notably buses, taxis, delivery vehicles, and courier \nservice motorbikes. This is highly inefficient use of the limited road space. Such activities \ncompound the congestion and creates a poor user experience for all road users. \n \n10.  Dangerous road conditions. The high traffic volumes and poor traffic management result \nin a high number of accidents, although these are normally classified as minor due to the slow \nspeeds. Access/egress to and from EDSA is very poor for pedestrian and public transport users. \nPoor access/egress to and from EDSA causes unsafe and uncomfortable trips for pedestrian and \npublic transport users. In addition, pedestrian environment is vulnerable to the intensified rainfalls, \nwhich is anticipated due to climate change. The congestion and inefficient transport systems are \ncontributing to a very unhealthy environment with high levels of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, \nand particulate matter resulting from vehicle emissions, the highest levels in the country. \n \n11.  High cost of transportation. A poor transport system is several impacting the economic \ndevelopment and growth of Metro Manila. Transportation costs for freight are very high due to \nincreased travel times resulting from sever congestion and it is normal for users of EDSA to \nexperience a 3\u20134 hour commute each day. The poorest in society are paying up to 30% of their \ndisposable income on transport or transport related costs. The congestion is resulting in missed \neconomic opportunities for business and people alike. Inefficient transport system is resulting in \n                                                \n5  LRT-2 is a 13.8 km-line with 11 stations starting from Santolan Station in Pasig City and ending in Recto station in \nManila. \n ", "18  Appendix 3 \nhigh levels of pollution with EDSA having the highest levels of hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, \ncarbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and toxics in the country, as well as high contributions of \ngreenhouse gases. \n \n12.  Institutional issues and jurisdiction. EDSA passes through six cities of Metro Manila \nand  is  under  the  control  of  the  Department  of  Public  Works  and  Highways  (DPWH)  for \ninfrastructure and the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) for traffic management, while \nthe  Department  of  Transportation  (DOTr)  is  responsible  for  public  transport  planning  and \noverseas operations. Each of the cities, together with MMDA, is responsible for traffic and land \nuse enforcement along EDSA. There is no consistent approach to the maintenance, operation, \nmanagement, or enforcement of traffic rules or operation of road space. Traffic management and \nroad safety on EDSA is almost non-existent. A clear institutional structure and well-defined roles \nand responsibilities are required to successfully implement the proposed loan.  \n \n \nB.  Proposed Ensuing Project \n \n13.  Integrated transport solutions. To improve the economic activity and competitiveness \nof business in Metro Manila the proposed loan will address the congestion experienced on EDSA \nthrough, an integrated solution\u2014 one that improves overall performance, while serving each of \nthe transport sub-modes that run along, or connect to the transport corridor. The solution must \nensure full integration with other proposed improvements in the wider corridor, notably the \nongoing work on Mega Manila Subway, C5 improvements as well as the North Luzon Expressway \n(NLEX)\u2013South Luzon Expressway connector projects. Any transport project addressing Metro \nManila transport problems will also be taken into account for integrated solutions. \n \n14.  System and management improvements. The overarching objective of the assistance \nis to improve economic competitiveness of business in Metro Manila and reduce the social burden \nof transportation costs and time loss. Easing the traffic flow and increase overall capacity \nthroughput along EDSA, and improving connectivity between public transport modes and access \nto the surrounding areas will allow both goods and people to travel more efficiently. Well-aligned \ninstitutional structures with powers and mandate to deliver are required. The project is the first \nphase in a series of assistance that is being considered by ADB to provide continued and ongoing \nsupport to address the traffic conditions in Manila. \n \n15.  The proposed project will address each main mode of transport: public transport, private \nvehicles, and pedestrians. Integrated, cross agency solutions will be delivered that will ensure \neach transport mode is improved and that road space allocation is provided in accordance with \nneed. The project will also improve connectivity to and from EDSA both to the local central \nbusiness district areas along the corridor, as well as with connecting transport modes and services. \n \nC.  Indicative Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n16.  Ensuing project impact. The project will be aligned with the following impact: economic \ncompetitiveness improved.6 \n \n17.  Ensuing  project  outcome.  The  project  will  have  the  following  outcome,  cost  of \ntransportation reduced.7 \n                                                \n6  NEDA. 2017. Philippine Development Plan 2017\u20132022. Manila. \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "  Appendix 3  19 \n \n18.  Ensuing project outputs. The project has three outputs, which will address the problems \nthrough an integrated suite of interlinked outputs. The project will include the following outputs: \n \n19.  Output  1.  Pedestrian  access  and  interchange  facilities  improved.  Improved \npedestrian and interchange facilities between public transport services, and the surrounding \ncatchment areas and new transport infrastructure will ensure the attractiveness of public transport \nand maintain a suitable mix of transport modes. This output is likely to form one of the core \nprojects for early delivery under the proposed loan.  \n \n20.  Output 2. Public transport operations improved. EDSA, being the primary public \ntransport corridor in Metro Manila, must increase its carrying capacity to meet the growing \ndemand  for  travel  and  improve  public  transport  services  and  operations.  Operational \nimprovements are required for all major public transport modes, LRT-1, MRT-3, city bus services \nand provincial bus services, as well as the proposed subway line. Bus reform will ensure that \nsupply meets demand, and that competition between bus services is removed from the street \nthrough modern, performance-based franchising arrangement. Design features catering for all \nusers will be included to ensure suitable travel environment for those with disabilities, women, the \nelderly and the youth. Operation support may also be provided while preparing these facilities. \nAny related transport infrastructure and facilities may be identified and prepared as required for \nintegrated solutions. \n \n21.  Output  3.  Traffic  management  and  institutional  oversight  improved.  A  traffic \nmanagement system will be developed for EDSA. The system will provide real time system \nmanagement  for  the  reformed  lane  operations  of  EDSA.  Traffic  management  and  traffic \nengineering solutions will be provided to address the number of lanes, to keep merging and/or \ndiverging traffic to a minimum, to cater for all major turning movement requirements, and eliminate \nencroachment along EDSA. The output will also include a communication and outreach program, \nwhich will outreach to those directly or indirectly affected by the project. Women's participation in \nboth the traffic management system and the outreach activities will be promoted. \n \nD.  Proposed Financing Plans and Modality \n \n22.  The total project cost is $525.0 million. The tentative financing plan for the project is \nprovided in Table 1. ADB will provide financing in an amount equivalent to $500.0 million from an \nordinary capital resources loan (including taxes and duties), to help finance civil works, goods and \nequipment, and consulting services for project implementation and capacity development. The \ngovernment will provide $25.0 million. A sector loan is proposed as the lending modality as the \nassistance will support the broader needs of urban transport improvements for each of the outputs \nthat can be demonstrated on the EDSA corridor and replicated in other parts of Metro Manila and \nother highly urbanized areas across the Philippines. Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $75.0 \nmillion. ADB will finance 100% of mitigation costs. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n23.  The TRTA will help the government to prepare the project and design the reform program, \nas well as help develop the capacity of key agencies to implement the ensuing project.8 \n                                                \n8  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 November 2017. \n ", "20  Appendix 3 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n24.  Output 1. Core and non-core subprojects on pedestrian access and interchange \nimprovements prepared. To support the proposed sector loan the first output of the TRTA will \nprepare the core project, the pedestrian access and interchange facilities in the Ortigas area. A \nconsultant firm will be hired to prepare all necessary documents for the core project, including: (i) \nproject scope, (ii) cost estimates, (iii) project viability assessment, (iv) financial arrangements, (v) \nimplementation structures, (vi) safeguard requirements for resettlement, environment and social \naspects, (vii) approvals as required, and (viii) bidding documentation. For the pedestrian access \nprojects that are not part of the core project a firm will be hired to prepare the necessary \ndocumentation. The same firm for output 1 would be required undertake this output. The initial \nstage of the work would be to agree suitable locations for pedestrian improvements along EDSA. \nOnce a firm set of locations is agreed by government the work would entail project preparation \nactivities including: (i) project scope, (ii) cost estimates, (iii) project viability assessment, (iv) \nfinancial  arrangements,  (v)  implementation  structures,  (vi)  safeguard  requirements  for \nresettlement, environment and social and gender aspects, (vii) approvals as required, and (viii) \nbidding documentation  \n \n25.  Output 2. Preparation of measurers and implementation arrangements to improve \npublic transport operations improved. The public transport subprojects for bus and MRT-3 \nimprovements will include rolling stock, signals, and station improvement for MRT-3, bus reform \nfor all PUVs on EDSA, including a new franchising mechanism and a fleet renewal program. For \nboth  MRT-3  and  bus  full  feasibility  studies,  project  evaluation,  safeguard  documentation, \nimplementation and contracting arrangements will be prepared under the TRTA.  \n \n26.  Output 3. Capacity development assessment, traffic management and institutional \noversight requirements assessed and actions for improvement prepared. A frim will be \nrecruited to prepare the traffic management program for EDSA, including (i) traffic management \nplanning and design concept for EDSA, (ii) traffic management improvement facilities such as \nnew lane markings, improvement of interchanges, sidewalks, and traffic management center, (iii) \ntraffic management and monitoring facilities and (iv) a program for the development and training \nof a traffic management unit. \n \n27.  The project will require close collaboration and joint working of several government \nagencies and local government units. A project management unit (PMU) will be established during \nthe project preparation activities that will ensure timely agreements are reached. The PMU will \nalso be used for project implementation to allow for capacity development of urban transport \nsystem improvements and management. \n \n28.
