INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In 2018, the environment ministers of the countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS)  endorsed  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Core  Environment  Program  Strategic \nFramework and Action Plan.1 Building on the success of phases 1 and 2 of the Core Environment \nProgram (CEP), the knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) aims to support the \nimplementation of the action plan. The TA will create enabling conditions to generate knowledge \nand leverage investments in (i) climate and disaster resilience and low carbon transitions, (ii) \nnatural resources and ecosystem services, and (iii) green technologies and financing.2  \n  \n2.  The  TA  is  strongly  aligned  with  Strategy  2030  operational  priorities  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), including (i) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster \nresilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; and (ii) fostering regional cooperation and \nintegration.3 It is also aligned with other operational priorities such as addressing remaining \npoverty  and  reducing  inequities,  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality,  promoting  rural \ndevelopment and food security, and strengthening governance and institutional capacity. The TA \nis included in the country operations business plans of the GMS countries.4 The TA will help GMS \ncountries implement nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement on Climate \nChange and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 2, SDG \n5, and SDG 13.5 Through enhancing capacities and enabling policies, demonstrating innovative \nactivities, and catalyzing private sector opportunities, the TA will help develop climate-friendly \nprojects in the GMS regional investment framework and help the GMS realize its overarching \nvision of an integrated, prosperous, and equitable subregion.6  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Depletion of natural assets and decline in environmental quality. Economic growth \nand prosperity of GMS countries are largely dependent on intensive use of the subregion\u2019s \nabundant natural resources.7 However, the subregion is rapidly depleting its natural assets such \nas land, forest, water, and wetlands; and ecosystem services and environmental quality are \ndeclining. Degradation of the environment and destruction of infrastructure caused by extreme \nweather events result in capital losses and erode development gains in production, market \nlinkages, employment generation, livelihoods, and social and gender equity. Further, a decline in \necosystem services, including a regulatory or buffering role against natural hazards, increases \nvulnerability to climate change and disasters. \n                                                \n1  ADB.  2018.

Increase in climate change vulnerability and greenhouse gas emissions. Nearly 41% \nof climate-induced disasters since 2000 occurred in the Asia and Pacific region, more than in any \nother region in the world. Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam have been identified \namong the 10 most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change.8 Adverse impacts of \nclimate change and transboundary climate risks in the GMS on rural infrastructure, communities, \nand ecosystems are projected to be severe. In Thailand and Viet Nam, for example, ADB has \nprojected climate change to reduce rice yields by 50% and gross domestic product by 7% by 2050 \nif no concerted actions are taken.9 Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per capita in the GMS have \nmore than doubled since 2001 and are increasing at a faster rate than in any other region, \nbecause of growing dependence on fossil fuels to meet energy and transport demands and \ncontinuing deforestation and land use changes. Indeed, GMS countries identified deforestation \nand  land-use  change,  coupled  with  increasing  energy  use  in  agriculture,  industry,  and \ntransportation, as the main factors for rising GHG emissions in the subregion (footnote 5).  \n \n5.  Degradation of natural landscapes and growing pollution. The deterioration of natural \nresources and environmental quality has reduced GMS economies\u2019 resilience to climate risks. \nNatural asset losses in the GMS are valued at 10%\u201312% of annual gross domestic product.10 \nFragmentation and degradation of habitats and landscapes, exacerbated by climate change, \nincrease such losses. Habitat fragmentation can reduce biodiversity by 13%\u201375% and impair \nessential ecosystem functions and services by decreasing biomass and altering nutrient cycles.11 \nDegradation of landscapes is especially rampant in border areas because of cross-border illegal \nexploitation of forest resources and population movements along porous borders. Transboundary \napproaches for landscape management, which consider physical features of the landscape along \nwith internal and external socioeconomic and sociopolitical drivers that affect land and natural \nresource use, are critical to address challenges that extend beyond traditional administrative \nboundaries. Likewise, the push for industrial development and agricultural intensification has \nsignificantly increased air, water, and soil pollution. Exposure to air and water pollution costs \nabout 9 million lives annually, mostly in developing Asia.12 Fertilizers, pesticides, and sediment \nare the main sources of agricultural pollutants that degrade and contaminate soil, groundwater \naquifers, and surface water; and directly impact the food chain. In addition, unsustainable \nmanagement  of  waste  (food  waste,  e-waste,  and  plastic  waste)  throughout  value  chains \ncontribute to high levels of pollution in ecosystems, with adverse impacts on human health.  \n \n6.  Low adoption of innovative technologies and financing deficits. Low technical know-\nhow, limited adoption of climate-resilient and low carbon technologies, and limited funding have \ncontributed to resource-use inefficiencies and vulnerabilities across GMS value chains. The GMS, \nmore than other regions, lacks consistent and comprehensive information on using innovative \ntechnologies to address climate change and environmental sustainability, and institutions that can \nfacilitate technology transfer. Further, current levels of investments in green infrastructure and \ntechnologies in GMS are well below the needs, and available financing to address climate and \ndisaster risks is also extremely limited. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations Catalytic \nGreen Financing Facility, established in April 2019, aims to mobilize $1 billion to provide loans \nand necessary TA for sovereign green infrastructure projects such as sustainable transport, clean \nenergy, and resilient water systems.  \n                                                \n8  D.

Regional cooperation in the GMS is critical to address the challenges in (i) promoting \nenabling policies and regulatory frameworks; (ii) strengthening capacities of diverse stakeholders, \nincluding  the  private  sector;  and  (iii)  demonstrating  advanced  technologies  and  financing \ninstruments. Effective management of climate change and environmental risks to communities, \nassets, and supply chains will also require innovative partnerships, with a focus on project \nincubation and scaling up, strategic planning and policy advice, and knowledge support. Regional \ncooperation is also crucial in adopting integrated solutions that bring together actions aimed at \nresilience building, GHG mitigation, and environmental sustainability. \n \n8.  The CEP phases 1 and 2, combined with the efforts of the other development partners, \nprovide a sound basis for further promoting subregional cooperation on environmental knowledge \nsharing and dialogue; climate and environmental policy initiatives and analytical work for better \ngovernance, efficiency, and equity; and the search for potential climate change and environmental \nmanagement transactions and inputs to prepare project concept papers and flagship knowledge \nproducts. Key achievements under CEP Phase 1 (2006\u22122011) included implementing a flagship \nproject\u23afthe  Biodiversity  Conservation  Corridors  Initiative\u23afto  identify  and  protect  core \nbiodiversity  areas  under  threat  and  improve  the  environmental  planning  capacity  of  GMS \ncountries through conducting strategic environmental assessments.13 In Phase 2 (2012\u20132019), \nthe CEP expanded assistance to cover broader landscape and planning support for economic \ncorridors, environmental impact assessments, and land use modeling; reduce carbon dioxide \nemissions in road freight; and provide solutions to build climate resilience of rural communities.  \n \n9.  Under both phases, the CEP has facilitated regional knowledge exchange and learning \nby working closely with ADB sector and country operational teams; agriculture, energy, and \ntransport agencies in the GMS countries; and development partners.14 While CEP was credited \nwith generating transformative effects in enhancing multisector multi-stakeholder engagement \nacross the GMS, further work is needed to better integrate environmental and climate change \nconsiderations into development planning and investment projects to achieve an environmentally \nfriendly and climate-resilient GMS Economic Cooperation Program.15 \n \n10.  The GMS Working Group on Environment (WGE), at its 24th annual meeting in April 2019 \nin Kunming, People\u2019s Republic of China, prioritized six themes and sought support from ADB and \nother development partners.16 The priorities include (i) building climate and disaster resilience; \n(ii) facilitating low carbon transitions; (iii) promoting climate-smart landscapes; (iv) enhancing \nenvironmental quality through pollution control and sustainable waste management; (v) deploying \ndigital technologies for climate actions and environmental sustainability; and (vi) financing low-\ncarbon and climate-resilient infrastructure and technologies, including demonstrating climate and \ndisaster risk financing instruments. \n \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2005.

The GMS WGE consists of senior government officials from the environment ministries of each of the six \nGMS countries. The WGE, under the framework of the GMS program, sets the strategic direction and provides inputs \nfor implementation of GMS CEP Strategic Framework and Action Plan. WGE reports to the GMS ministers at the \nGMS ministerial meetings and the GMS summit. The organizational and reporting structure of GMS and WGE is in \nAppendix 4 of the GMS CEP Strategic Framework and Action Plan (footnote 1). \n \n \n ", "4 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: climate compatibility and environmental \nsustainability of economic growth in the GMS improved (footnote 1). The TA will have the following \noutcome: climate resilience, green growth, and environmental quality in the GMS enhanced.17 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  The TA will take a holistic approach and enhance ADB\u2019s value addition by promoting high-\nlevel technologies, novel knowledge products, and integrated solutions. The TA will also support \nenabling policies to support private sector investments. By thoroughly assessing how each GMS \ncountry is responding to various challenges, the TA will deliver three outputs, while minimizing \nrisks encountered in past and ongoing efforts, and drawing upon lessons and good practices from \nsimilar efforts in other countries.18  \n \n13.  Output 1: Climate and disaster resilience enhanced, and low carbon transitions \nfacilitated. This output will help countries accelerate adaptation and disaster risk reduction efforts \nthrough (i) creating a gender-responsive policy platform on climate and disaster resilience to \nsupport  implementing  national  adaptation  plans  and  national  disaster  risk  reduction  plans; \n(ii) strengthening government staff capacity to mainstream climate and disaster resilience in \nplanning and to climate-proof infrastructure investments in priority vulnerable sectors such as \nagriculture, water resources, and transport; and (iii) supporting gender-responsive and socially \ninclusive studies on community- and ecosystem-based adaptation and disaster risk management \ninitiatives, including early warning systems, to scale them up in larger investments. The TA will \nassess the role of indigenous adaptation practices and opportunities in enhancing community and \necosystem resilience and blending them with modern technologies. The TA will also (i) document \nlessons learned from activities implemented in GMS countries; (ii) study global and regional good \npractices; and (iii) demonstrate new or modified approaches and document lessons learned from \nthem. The TA, in close cooperation with the private sector, will facilitate low carbon transitions \nthrough (i) identifying policies and measures to effectively implement climate investment plans for \nagriculture, energy, and transport, which are aligned with nationally determined contributions; (ii) \nstrengthening  capacities  for  monitoring,  reporting,  and  verifying  climate  actions;  and \n(iii) conducting demonstrations on low carbon agriculture and green freight, while exploring \ntransactions in greening the tourism sector. \n \n                                                \n17 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n18 As short-term investment priorities tend to override long-term environmental sustainability concerns, the TA will \nextend assistance to and involve planning and finance ministries, in addition to environmental ministries. As \ngovernment interest in borrowing to address climate change and environmental issues is still limited in the GMS, the \nTA team will proactively collaborate with the private sector to increase its awareness of climate and environmental \nrisks to long-term sustainability. Because of declining overseas development assistance for environmental protection \nin the GMS, especially by development partners that were involved in previous phases, the TA team will mobilize \nresources from a broader network of potential funding sources, including ADB\u2019s own trust funds. Building capacities \nof the GMS countries to effectively use environmental assessment, planning, and management tools is a long-term \nprocess that would require considerable additional resources and commitment by national development agencies. \nWhile the program\u2019s past focus on knowledge sharing and capacity building will continue, future efforts need also to \nfocus on field demonstrations to strengthen technical and institutional capacities and assess options to create an \nenabling policy environment to mobilize and de-risk private sector investments. \n \n \n ", "5 \n \n14.  Output  2:  Climate-smart  landscapes  promoted  and  environmental  quality \nenhanced. Aligned with the objectives of the United Nations Decade of Landscape Restoration \n2021\u22122030 and the ADB Oceans Financing Initiative, this output will strengthen regulations and \nbuild capacities to adopt landscape approaches in managing natural resources,  enhancing \necosystem  services,  and  improving  environmental  quality.19 The  sub-output  on  promoting \nclimate-smart  landscapes  will  deploy  nature-based  solutions  to  manage  at  least  three \ntransboundary landscapes through (i) improving land use management systems; (ii) designing \ninnovative compensation mechanisms for ecosystem services and reducing emissions from \ndeforestation  and  forest  degradation;  and  (iii)  enhancing  the  capacity  of  institutions  and \ncommunities,  including  women  and  other  vulnerable  groups,  in  integrated  landscape \nmanagement  through  targeted  training  workshops  on  landscape  conservation,  forest  fire \nmanagement, and natural regeneration of forests assisted by communities. The sub-output on \nenhancing environmental quality through pollution control and waste management will (i) build \ninstitutional  capacities  for  strategic  environmental  planning,  environmental  quality  data \nmanagement, and guidelines on air, water, and soil pollution control and remediation; (ii) provide \npolicy support for implementing a circular economy and waste management; and (iii) conduct \ndetailed studies and prepare concept papers for investments to address air and water pollution, \nincluding plastics. \n \n15.  Output 3: Green technologies and financing instruments demonstrated. This output \nwill promote the use of innovative technologies and financing instruments in close collaboration \nwith the private sector. The sub-output on deploying advanced technologies for climate action \nand environmental sustainability will identify good practices for strengthening technology policies  \nand demonstrate the application of high-level digital technologies such as the Internet of Things,20 \nartificial intelligence, robotics, and drones for (i) monitoring climate actions, (ii) monitoring and \nmanaging  pollution, (iii)  managing forests  sustainably,  and  (iv)  implementing  early  warning \nsystems to facilitate adaptation. It will enhance capacities of communities, public institutions, and \nthe private sector to use digital technologies. The sub-output on demonstrating innovative climate \nand disaster risk financing instruments will (i) assess enabling conditions to deploy innovative \nfinancing instruments, and access environmental finance through national entities, in partnership \nwith international organizations and the private sector; (ii) demonstrate climate and disaster risk \nfinancing instruments (e.g., blended finance, community resilience credit lines, and insurance); \nand (iii) strengthen the capacity of financial institutions to support green technologies and \ninfrastructure.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $5.0 million, of which (i) $2.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6); and (ii) $3.0 million will be financed \non  a  grant  basis  by  the  Climate  Change  Fund.21 The  six  GMS  governments  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. \nBased on the TA\u2019s progress and needs, additional funds may be provided annually or in alternate \nyears, including from cofinancing sources and ADB-administered trust funds. The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2019.

Staff from resident missions will be closely involved in the \nimplementation and invited to selected WGE meetings. In each GMS country, WGE focal point \nand a national government staff will oversee the implementation of all TA activities, through a \nletter of intent, with support from the consulting team. ADB will select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants and provide staff to act as resource persons in the workshops. Consultants will screen \nall activities to ensure minimal or no adverse social or environmental impacts as per the ADB \nSafeguards Policy Statement (2009). Engagement of consultants and procurement of goods and \nequipment will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its \nassociated project administration instructions or staff instructions. Any goods and assets procured \nwill be turned over or disposed following ADB procedures. \n \n18.   The TA will publish knowledge products, including gender-specific reports, targeted at \ngovernment officials, researchers, and development partners for the WGE annual meetings and \nenvironment ministers\u2019 meetings. The TA will publish a limited number of copies of selected \nreports in English and the local language, as needed. The TA will develop climate change and \nenvironment information portals and the GMS secretariat will maintain them at the GMS website.23   \nThe TA will create online communities on social media platforms and deactivate these online \ncommunities within 3 months after the TA completion date.
