THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Kiribati for the Road Rehabilitation Project. \n \n2.  The project will rehabilitate 27.5 kilometers (km) of main road and 6 km of principal \nfeeder and access roads on the atoll of South Tarawa. By improving the very poor condition of \nthe country\u2019s most important road, which joins the airport with the seaport of Betio through the \nadministrative  capital  of  Bairiki  and  runs  the  length  of  an  extremely  narrow  and  densely \npopulated area that is home to more than two-fifths of Kiribati\u2019s people, the project will make the \nnation\u2019s transportation system more efficient and add to its overall quality of life. The World \nBank and the Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility (PRIF) will cofinance the project with the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The  pressures  of  high  population  growth  underlie  many  of  Kiribati's  development \nchallenges. They are most pronounced in South Tarawa, where 42% of the population lives and \nwhich attracts migrants with opportunities for cash employment, diverse consumer goods, and \naccess to essential social services. The seaport islet of Betio, for example, has an estimated \n2,588 people per square kilometer or half of the population density of Tokyo, Japan. This has \nput South Tarawa\u2019s land and fresh water resources, its public health, education, water, and \nelectricity services, and its roads under severe strain.  \n \n4.  Kiribati\u2019s growth potential is constrained by (i) the small land area of its 33 islands which \nare  dispersed  over  3.5  million  square  kilometers  of  ocean;  (ii)  its  remoteness  from  major \nmarkets, which makes its external transport costs high; (iii) its extreme vulnerability to natural \nforces,  including  climate  change  and  rising  sea  levels;  and  (iv)  the  scarcity  of  its  natural \nresources. Because the public sector accounts for 50% of gross domestic product and provides \naround two-thirds of formal sector employment, government expenditure tends to drive the \neconomy. \n \n5.  The development priorities set out in the Kiribati Development Plan 2008\u20132011 are \neconomic growth and poverty reduction, along with creating a sustainable environment, and \nbetter  governance  and  infrastructure.  The  plan  aligns  with  ADB's  core  specializations  of \ninfrastructure and environment, including climate change, under Strategy 20201 as well as its \ndrivers  of  change\u2014private  sector  development  and  good  governance  and  capacity \ndevelopment.  The  Kiribati  country  partnership  strategy  2010\u20132014  aims  to  support  the \ngovernment in three key plan areas\u2014economic growth and poverty reduction, the environment, \nand infrastructure.2 Poverty reduction is to be achieved by promoting economic opportunities \nthrough more efficient public financial management and creating more and better access and \ndelivery of sustainable infrastructure services. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  ADB. 2010. Country Partnership Strategy; Kiribati, 2010\u20132014. Manila. ", "2 \n6.  The transport, power, water supply, and sanitation infrastructure necessary for economic \ndevelopment is generally in bad condition in Kiribati and poorly managed. Good infrastructure is \nneeded in the population and potential economic growth centers to upgrade services and lower \nthe economy\u2019s cost structure. Many of these services are delivered inefficiently and incur high \ncosts but are provided to users at below-cost prices. Substandard infrastructure raises business \ncosts and contributes to poverty by restricting job creation. The lack of basic public services is a \nmain cause of hardship and poor health outcomes in Kiribati. When services are inadequate or \ninaccessible, willingness to pay is undermined and service provision spirals downward. The \ngovernment is limited in its ability to increase public investment. \n \n7.  The country\u2019s small network of main and minor roads is about 800 km long, of which 133 \nkm are sealed. South Tarawa has 41.6 km of sealed roads and Kiritimati 84 km. The remaining \nroads, mostly unsealed, are distributed among the other inhabited islands and atolls. Kiritimati\u2019s \nnetwork is relatively lightly used and in good condition compared with the South Tarawa roads, \nwhose rapid deterioration under heavy traffic has national economic and social significance.  \n \n8.  Prolonged wet weather and ever heavier traffic volumes have accelerated road damage \non South Tarawa in the past year and, while parts of the network were rehabilitated in 2008, the \nremaining sections of paved roads have reached the end of their economic life. This profoundly \naffects the lives of the entire population, virtually all of whom live close to and depend in many \nways on the main road. Average travel speed is reduced to 20 km per hour and vehicles are \nforced to navigate large, deep depressions that fill with water during the rainy season. Taxi \noperators have reportedly stopped services to avoid further damage to vehicles. In the dry \nseason, dust along unpaved sections causes upper respiratory tract problems. Large pools of \nstagnant water present another public health risk as breeding grounds for mosquitoes. South \nTarawa residents cannot escape these problems. The atoll is generally no more than 100 \nmeters wide and almost all of them live, work, or study in dwellings, small businesses, and \nschools that line either side of almost its entire length.  \n \n9.  Road use in South Tarawa has grown 4% annually in recent years, with 6,000 vehicles \nnow travelling the busiest roads in Betio and Bairiki each day, 40% of them privately owned \nminibuses that provide public transportation. The government hires these minibuses and uses \nits own buses to transport government personnel to and from work at a cost of about A$1.5 \nmillion per annum. The few heavy vehicles, including fuel tankers and container transports, \ncontribute  significantly  to  erosion  of  the  road edges  but the  pavement  is generally  strong \nenough because the underlying coral gravel is solid.  \n \n10.  Fragmented  and  ineffective  governance  arrangements  have  contributed  to  the \ndeterioration of South Tarawa\u2019s road network. The police department is responsible for vehicle \ninspections although regulations are outdated, as well as for licensing drivers and safety. Town \ncouncils collect annual vehicle licensing fees and set fares for public transport but the fees are \nvery  low  and  the  councils  are  responsible  only  for  maintaining  feeder  roads.  Little  or  no \nmaintenance is performed on either the main or feeder roads. The Ministry of Public Works and \nUtilities  (MPWU)  is  supposed  to  maintain  the  main  roads  but  receives  an  overall  annual \nmaintenance  appropriation  that  includes  other  activities  and  is  insufficient.  Maintenance  is \ninadequate and reactive.  \n \n11.  A lack of routine drainage maintenance and a failure to make timely pothole repairs have \nallowed formerly paved sections of the road to be reduced to a gravel surface. No periodic \nmaintenance or resealing has been done. The roads, moreover, are more than 20 years old and \nwould be overdue for rehabilitation even after proper care.  \n ", "3 \n \n12.  To ensure proper maintenance in the future, the project can make use of an opportunity \nto rationalize the management and financing of the road sector in South Tarawa. The road \nnetwork is small but vehicle traffic is heavy and the tolls collected yearly on the system\u2019s Betio \nCauseway exceed what is needed to fund annual maintenance of all of the atoll\u2019s roads. The \ncauseway maintenance fund has a balance of A$2.5 million from accumulated toll revenue. \nFurther  maintenance  funding  could  be  made  available  by  raising  fuel  taxes  and  annual \nregistration fees, both of which are low. \n \n13.  Through  capacity  building  and  institutional  reform,  the  project  will  ensure  that \nmaintenance is adequately performed and financed and that the rehabilitated roads remain \nserviceable for at least 20 years. \n \n14.  The project has been jointly prepared by ADB and World Bank staff in coordination with \nthe New Zealand Aid Programme, which has current projects for infrastructure development and \ncapacity building in South Tarawa. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The project\u2019s impact will be an improvement in socioeconomic conditions for the people \nof South Tarawa. The outcome will be their access to a safe, sustainable, well-maintained road \nnetwork. The outputs will be (i) the rehabilitation or upgrading of the road network in South \nTarawa, and (iii) trained and equipped community-based enterprises for road maintenance.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n16.  Output 1. The South Tarawa road network will be rehabilitated and upgraded. The civil \nworks will be procured under a single civil works contract and will comprise the following \ninvestment components:  \n \n(i)  Rehabilitation of paved roads. The road from St. Anne to the airport (21.5 km), \nincluding the Temaiku spur (about 2.8 km), will be rehabilitated. Rehabilitation \nand upgrading will include reconstruction and strengthening of the pavement, \ndrainage improvements, and provision of such safety features as speed humps \nand footpaths. \n(ii)  Repairs to paved roads in Betio and Bikenibeu. In 2008, the Government of \nJapan financed the reconstruction of the paved road network in Betio. Since \nthen,  localized  pavement  failures  have  occurred,  mainly  due  to  inadequate \ndrainage. These will be repaired under the project and additional drainage will be \nbuilt.  \n(iii)  Sealing of feeder roads. About 6 km of priority unsealed urban feeder roads \nwith high traffic volumes will be upgraded and sealed.  \n(iv)  Rehabilitation of Betio Causeway. The pavement on the causeway (about 3.2 \nkm) will be rehabilitated and the bridge deck will be repaired. \n \n17.  Output 2. The project will establish community-based road maintenance groups with the \ncapacity to maintain the road network. The civil works contractor will employ and train persons \nselected  by  the  MPWU,  which  will  be  the  implementing  agency,  in  consultation  with  the \ncontractor, community groups, town councils, and relevant stakeholders. Technical assistance \n(TA)  will  prepare  and  deliver  training  programs  not  provided  by  the  contractor,  including \naccounting  and  business  management  (para.  25).  The  training  in  maintenance  practices \n ", "4 \nprovided by the contractor will be hands-on and monitored by the contract supervising engineer \nto ensure that it is effective. The civil works contract will include a 2-year defects liability period \nduring which routine maintenance will remain the responsibility of the civil works contractor but \nwill be undertaken by the community-based maintenance groups, which the contractor will \nengage  under  a  performance-based  contract.  The  MPWU  will  assume  responsibility  for \nmaintenance when the defects liability period expires but will also engage the community-based \nmaintenance  groups  for  this  work  under  performance-based  contracts.  Major  periodic \nmaintenance or repair of storm damage will not be covered by these contracts and will be \nundertaken by MPWU. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n18.

The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR7,621,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project,3 including taxes and duties.4 \nThe loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Interest during construction will be capitalized. \n \n20.  In addition to ADB financing of the equivalent of $12 million, the Government of Kiribati \nwill provide $1.05 million to be drawn from user tolls on the Betio Causeway. The Government \nof Australia is expected to provide $3.75 million toward the cost of the civil works on a grant \nbasis through the PRIF. The government has also requested a loan of $16.0 million from the \nInternational Development Association resources of the World Bank. The PRIF will also finance \n                                                \n3  Including transportation and insurance charges. \n4  The amount of taxes and duties to be financed (i) is within the thresholds identified in the Kiribati country \npartnership strategy 2010\u20132014, (ii) does not represent an excessive share of the project investment plan, (iii) is \nmaterial and relevant to the success of the project, and (iv) applies only to ADB-financed expenditures. \n ", "5 \nassociated TA for capacity development ($0.86 million). The World Bank will manage the PRIF \nfinancing (Table 2).  \n \n21.  ADB will finance the cost of consultants\u2019 services to facilitate advance action on the \nrecruitment of consultants for design and supervision services. The government, ADB, the \nPRIF, and the World Bank will finance the cost of civil works in the proportions set forth in the \ndetailed cost estimates (Appendix 2).5  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  12.00    35.70 \nCofinanciers       \nWorld Bank  16.00    47.50 \nPacific Region Infrastructure Facility  4.61    13.70 \nGovernment  1.05    3.10 \n  Total    33.66    100.00 \nSources: Asian Development Bank and World Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The implementation arrangements applicable to the ADB loan are summarized in Table \n3 and described in detail in the project administration manual (footnote 5).  \n \n23.  The  procurement  under  ADB  financing  will  be  carried  out  in  compliance  with  ADB \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) with such modifications and \nwaivers as ADB will have agreed to for this project. ADB and the World Bank are setting up \narrangements to cooperate and coordinate their efforts for joint financing and implementation of \nthe  project  in  consultation  with  the  government.  For  this  purpose,  ADB  is  developing,  in \nconsultation  with  the  World  Bank,  a  memorandum  of  understanding  to  lay  out  the  basic \nprinciples and procedural aspects of collaboration during the implementation of the project. In \nview of the limited number of global suppliers likely to be interested in a geographically isolated \nproject of this size, it is not feasible or desirable to split the works into separate physical \ncomponents or contracts with different suppliers. It is therefore more efficient and economical to \nprocure the civil works under a single contract that will be cofinanced jointly with the World \nBank, PRIF, and the government. To enable joint cofinancing of this procurement package, ADB \nBoard of Directors\u2019 waiver of member country procurement eligibility restrictions is sought to \npermit participation of bidders from non-ADB member countries and/or procurement of goods \nand services from non-ADB member countries. In addition, considering the joint nature of the \nfinancing and significant fiduciary and reputation risks involved, firms and entities sanctioned by \neither of ADB or the World Bank will be debarred from participating in contracts which are jointly \nfinanced. \n \n24.  Consulting services. A firm of consultants will be recruited for design and construction \nsupervision. Because recruitment delays can delay project implementation and the MPWU lacks \ncapacity for this activity, ADB will, at the government\u2019s request, select the firm to expedite the \nprocess.6 The Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED), the executing agency, \nwill enter into a contract with the selected firm. \n                                                \n5  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  Due to lack of capacity for undertaking consultant recruitment, the MFED asked ADB to undertake selection on its \nbehalf. Advance action on consultant recruitment will reduce the implementation period by an estimated 6 months. \nConsultants will be fielded by 6 January 2011. \n ", "6 \n \n25.  Associated Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility-financed technical assistance. \nUnder an associated TA financed by the PRIF and managed by the World Bank, the project will \nhelp the government develop better institutional arrangements for managing Kiribati\u2019s road \nassets, making the land transport sector more efficient, and using funds effectively.  It will \nsupport a review of the existing arrangements in the sector and the design and implementation \nof a road map for restructuring. This process will include (i) identifying the options for reforming \nthe related ministries; (ii) identifying options for recovering and allocating the cost of maintaining \nroads, including the use of revenues from vehicle import duties, fuel taxes, and registration fees; \nand (iii) preparing associated legislation. A second component will support a road safety action \nplan  and  the  reinvigoration  of  an  existing  but  nonfunctional  Road  Safety  Committee. \nMicroenterprise road maintenance groups will be established and trained under a third TA \ncomponent.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n26.  Design and construction. Project design and construction pose no significant technical \nissues. Project preparation included a comprehensive road safety audit of all of South Tarawa\u2019s \nroads and the recommendations that emerged will form the basis of the detailed engineering \ndesigns.8 The key challenge will be a scarcity of local material for road construction. Beach \nmining of local coral gravel is unacceptable because of potential environmental damage through \ncoastal erosion. The project will import aggregates instead. The most likely source is Nauru \nwhere the restoration of areas that have been mined for phosphates is to be financed in part by \ncrushing and exporting limestone pinnacles left behind in the extraction process. This material \noffers an added advantage, in that it is better for this rehabilitation work than coral. Because the \nrapid pavement deterioration on the road has resulted mainly from poor drainage, the drainage \ncomponent of the project will need to be carefully designed.  \n \n27.  Climate change. The road runs near the edge of the lagoon for most of its length. A rise \nin sea level and increased erosion represent the most significant threats to its sustainability. \nCoastal protection work is ongoing under the second phase of the World Bank-financed Kiribati \nAdaptation Project 9 and a third phase is planned. The drainage design will take into account \nthe  possible  risk  posed  by  heavier  rainfall  in  future  years.  Because  some  future  climate \nscenarios also forecast longer and more intense droughts, the project will consider directing \nrunoff to soak pits to increase groundwater. \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n28.  Economic impact. The economic internal rates of return calculated for the rehabilitation \nof all the project road sections, using the World Bank Highway Development and Management \nModel, lie between 24% and 105% and average 45.3% overall. 10 These high rates of return \nreflect the heavy traffic of up to 6,000 vehicles per day on the existing road system and its poor \ncurrent condition. Economic internal rates of return for road safety improvements have not been \ncalculated since the specific safety activities will be defined during project implementation. \nBased on prior experience, however, road safety improvements generate a high rate of return \nthat usually exceeds those for rehabilitation.  \n \nC.  Governance \n29.  Financial governance. Kiribati\u2019s procurement practices have no systematic mechanism \nfor collecting data on the use of open competition, make no public disclosure of contracts \nawarded, and lack procurement regulations. The use of expenditure commitment controls varies \nbetween ministries but is generally insufficient. Although financial laws and regulations have \nbeen updated periodically since their original enactment in the mid-1970s, they do not reflect \ncurrent  business  practices  or  modern  public  financial  management.  Understanding  and \ncompliance with existing regulations is also weak. Internal audit is weak, does not have its own \nmandate, and is not actively involved in systems monitoring. \n                                                \n8  World Bank. 2010. Report of the Road Safety Audit on Tarawa, Republic of Kiribati. Sydney. \n9  Phases 1 and 2 of the Kiribati Adaptation Project have been implemented by World Bank and supported by World \nBank, the Global Environmental Facility, the Australian Agency for International Development, and the New \nZealand Aid Programme, the Japan PHRD Climate Change Fund, the United Nations Development Programme \n(UNDP). A parallel project by the European Union also involves coastal protection work. \n10 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \n30.  A public expenditure and financial accountability assessment conducted in Kiribati in \nearly 2010 identified weaknesses in budget accuracy, significant delays and quality issues in \nrecording and reporting financial information, and deficiencies in internal controls and audit. \nBased on this assessment, the project will use only direct disbursement procedures and an \nexternal  auditor  will  be  engaged  for  the  annual  audit  of  project  accounts.  The  single \nprocurement by international competitive bidding for the civil works contract will be managed by \nthe design and supervision consultants, with close oversight from ADB and the World Bank. \n \n31.  ADB has explained and discussed its Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwith  the  government,  the  MFED,  and  the  MPWU.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n32.  The project will directly benefit the entire population of South Tarawa for whom the road \nis a vital shared communal asset. As the lone vehicular transport route on the atoll, the road \nprovides access to the airport, the port, local wharves, markets, churches, nongovernment \norganizations,  businesses,  and  government,  education,  and  health  services.  It  sustains \neconomic development, links communities, and is also the main thoroughfare for pedestrians. \n \n33.  Private car owners, bus and truck operators, freight handlers, retailers and wholesalers, \nutility  providers,  public  transport  users,  motorcyclists,  cyclists,  pedestrians,  residents, \nbusinesses, and the government will all benefit directly from the project. It will reduce roadside \ndust, thereby improving air quality, leaving homes, shops, and vehicles cleaner, and reducing \ndamage to equipment. It will make bus travel more convenient and pleasant and provide safer \nbus stops and bus shelters that protect travellers from sun and rain. New footpaths will improve \npedestrian safety and cut back reliance and spending on vehicle transport. The project design \nwill minimize damage to roadside trees, which provide shade and shelter from sun and rain. \n \n34.  The port area of Betio, which the project road serves, is the site of a prostitution industry \nthat presents the risk of HIV/AIDS transmission. While the current HIV/AIDS rate in South \nTarawa is reported to be low, the port is a hub for international fishing vessels and an estimated \n30% of the sexually active population has a sexually transmitted infection. There is a risk that \ninfection rates will increase. The project will conduct an HIV/AIDS information and education \ncampaign for the contractor\u2019s employees, subcontractors, consultants, and communities near \nthe project site. The Kiribati Country Coordinating Mechanism has been established by the \ngovernment  to  coordinate  HIV/AIDS  activities  including  voluntary  counseling  and  testing \nfacilities.  The  civil  works  contract  will  contain  a  provisional  sum  to  cover  the  cost  of  the \ninformation and education campaign. The Kiribati Country Coordinating Mechanism will work \nwith  the  contractor  to  identify  an  appropriate  nongovernment  organization  to  deliver  the \ninformation and education campaign. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n35.  In preparing the project, due diligence has been conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n ", "9 \n36.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  and  an  initial  environmental \nexamination has been prepared.11 The main potential impacts include (i) disturbance from dust \narising from  loading,  unloading,  and transportation  of  construction  materials;  (ii)  noise;  (iii) \nerosion  and  sedimentation  from  exposed  surfaces  during  construction  that  may  affect  the \nlagoon environment; (iv) risks from the use and disposal of hazardous materials such as used \nfuel and lubricants; and (v) increased risk of accidents from increased vehicle movements. \nDetailed  mitigation  measures  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project,  as  outlined  in  the \nenvironmental management plan. A national environmental specialist to be engaged for 4.5 \nperson-months will monitor the implementation of this plan during the 18 months of construction.   \n \n37.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is classified as category B. No buildings are to be \nrelocated and no economic crops affected. To the extent possible, the rehabilitated roads will be \ndesigned  for  construction  on  the  current  road  alignment.  New  bus  bays  and  drainage \neasements will be outside of this area but people who may be affected will be consulted during \nthe design to determine where best to locate these facilities to minimize resettlement. Any \nresettlement that may be  required  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance with  the  resettlement \nplan.12 The World Bank will finance the cost of the related TA for updating land and economic \ncrop  valuation.  Few  areas  are  expected  to  require  land  acquisition  for  resettlement.  If \nacquisitions prove necessary, the Ministry of Environment, Land and Agriculture Development, \nwhose surveyors will be supported by those of the design and construction supervision teams, \nhas been assessed to have adequate capacity to implement the resettlement plan.  \n \n38.  Indigenous persons. The project is classified as category C. The people of South \nTarawa are from a single ethnic group. There are no customary, cultural, economic, social, or \npolitical institutions that set South Tarawa apart from the rest of Kiribati society. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n39.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin  the  risk  assessment  and risk  management  plan.13 The  risks  can  be  managed  and  are \nmitigated by the design of the project. The intended benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nIncreased prices for fuel and raw materials lead to  Cost overruns, particularly at civil works bidding \ncost overruns.  stage, will be mitigated by reducing the project \nscope prior to awarding the contract.  \nThe government provides insufficient funding for  The civil works contractor will be responsible for \nroad maintenance.  maintenance  for  an  extended  defects  liability \nperiod  of  2  years,  ensuring  that  any  poor \nconstruction exposed by a second wet season is \nrepaired. \nTechnical  assistance  will  help  the  government \nestablish  a  dedicated  road  fund  from  user \ncharges  and  will  train  community-based  road \nmaintenance groups. \nThe  Government  of  Kiribati  lacks  capacity  to  A single design and supervision consultant will \nimplement the project, including the preparation  provide  support  to  the  MPWU  and  the \n                                                \n11 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n12 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n13 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nof quality and timely financial reports to ADB.  government in implementing the project, including \nprocuring the civil works contractor. \nDirect  payment  methodology  will  be  used  for \ndisbursements. \nThe project will provide training to key staff in the \nMPWU and the MFED. \nADB and the World Bank will conduct regular \nreview missions. \nAn external auditor will be hired to conduct the \nannual audit of the project. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MFED = Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, MPWU = \nMinistry of Public Works and Utilities. \nSources: ADB and World Bank assessments. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n40.  The government and the MFED have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement,  as \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual and the loan agreement. \n \n41.  The government and the MFED have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n42.  Subject  to  compliance  with  conditions  for  loan  effectiveness  set  forth  in  the  loan \nagreement, the loan shall become effective only if funding from the World Bank and the PRIF \nhas been secured. ADB may suspend or cancel its loan if the World Bank and/or PRIF funding \nis suspended or withdrawn. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n43.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n  \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR7,621,000 to the Republic of \nKiribati for the Road Rehabilitation Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace period \nof  8  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n(ii)  the proposal set forth in paragraph 23 of this report that procurement (a) in \ncountries  that  are  not  developing  member  countries  of  ADB  or  developed \nmember countries of ADB that have contributed to ADB's relevant Special Funds \nresources, and (b) of goods and services produced in such countries, be eligible \nfor financing under the Road Rehabilitation Project.  \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n19 November 2010  \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nThe socioeconomic  The average incidence  Kiribati National Statistical  The government \nconditions of the  of basic needs poverty  Office and United Nations  sustains policies \npopulation of South  in South Tarawa  Development Programme  conducive to \nTarawa have improved.  reduced from 24.2%  household income and  economic growth \n(2006) to 18% by 2016  expenditure surveys  and poverty \n  (carried out at 5-year   reduction.  \n  intervals)   \n     \nStable public  Tarawa town councils or   \ntransportation costs,  successor organization for \nafter accounting  for  fare regulation \nfuel cost fluctuation   \n(base cost $0.90 per  Public transport operators \nstage in 2010, fuel cost \nA$1.09 per liter, 2010) \nOutcome      Assumptions \nThe population has  Increase in average  Project specific surveys by  Implementation of \nsustainable access to a  travel speed from 20  project consultants  the World Bank-\nsafe, well-maintained  km per hour to 40 km    financed TA for \nroad network in South  per hour by April 2013     institutional reform in \nTarawa.      the road sector and \nDecrease in road  Police and Ministry of  for establishment of \ncasualties from 7 per  Health statistics collated in  a sustainable road \nyear (2007) to 5 per  the annual report of a road  maintenance \nyear (2013)  safety council   financing \n    mechanism is \nAdequate financing for  Government accounts  successful. \nroad maintenance     \n(base $1,000 per km,  Implementation of \ntarget $1,500 per  the World Bank-\nkilometer by 2013)  financed TA for road \nsafety is successful. \n \nThe MPWU provides \nefficient support for \nimplementation. \n \nRisk \nThe government is \ncomplacent about \nroad condition after \nrehabilitation and \nneglects \nmaintenance. \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
