The Government of Thailand has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to support the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) in mainstreaming \nenergy efficiency measures in Thai municipalities. A TA grant in the amount of $500,000 is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s assistance program for Thailand in 2008, and the country partnership strategy \nidentifies support for energy efficiency and clean energy initiatives as core areas of cooperation \nbetween the Government and ADB.1 A fact-finding mission was undertaken from 4 to 8 August \n2008 to consult with PEA and other key stakeholders on the desired scope and expected results \nof the TA. Based on initial cost estimates, ADB\u2019s climate change steering committee endorsed \nthe mission\u2019s request to increase the grant amount of the proposed TA to a total of $1 million.2 \nThis  report  reflects  the  findings  of  the  mission  and  the  understanding  reached  with  the \nGovernment and PEA on the scope, impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \ncost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA.3 The TA design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Thailand is a net importer of energy. The proportion of Thailand\u2019s energy imports as a \npart of total imports grew to the unprecedented level of 18% in 2007, up from 12.9% in 2001. In \n2007, approximately 60% of Thailand\u2019s energy demand was met through imported sources at a \ncost of about $27 billion. While crude oil accounts for more than 80% of Thailand\u2019s energy \nimports, the fastest growing energy import in recent years has been coal, which is primarily the \nresult of the rapid expansion of independent power producers. A breakdown of Thailand\u2019s \nenergy imports is in Appendix 2. The Government is acutely aware that access to secure \nsources of energy is essential for sustaining economic growth, productivity, and competitiveness.  \n \n3.  In an effort to improve national energy security, the Ministry of Energy has introduced a \nnumber of measures to reduce Thailand\u2019s dependency on energy imports and to promote \ngreater energy efficiency. A core objective is to lower the country\u2019s energy elasticity\u2014the ratio of \nenergy consumption to gross domestic product (GDP)\u2014from its current high level of 1.4 to 1.4 In \nother words, a 1% increase in GDP generates a 1.4% increase in energy demand. Short-term \nenergy conservation measures and efficiency improvements aim to reduce Thailand\u2019s energy \nelasticity to 0.85 to 1 by 2011. The longer-term energy elasticity target is 0.6 to 1 by 2020. \n \n4.  The  Government  has  introduced  a  range  of  supply-  and  demand-side  policies  and \nprograms to expand domestic energy sources and reduce consumption levels. On the supply-\nside, the Ministry of Energy has a stated policy objective that renewable energy projects such as \nwind, solar, biomass, biogas, and micro-hydro will comprise 8% of Thailand\u2019s overall generating \ncapacity  by  2011.  In  support  of  this  objective,  the  Renewable  Portfolio  Standard  of  2003 \nrequires  the  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of  Thailand  to  ensure  that  renewable  energy \nsources are at least 5% of new generating capacity during 2008\u20132010.5  \n                                                 \n1  The TA is also aligned with ADB\u2019s new long-term strategic framework and its emphasis on improving energy \nefficiency as a means to realize environmentally-sustainable growth for the region. ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: \nLong-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. Manila. \n2  The climate change steering committee endorsed the allocation of $1 million from the Multi-Donor Clean Energy \nFund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, on a grant basis, to finance the TA. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 November 2008. \n4  By comparison, the energy elasticity is estimated to be 0.8 to 1 for the United States and 0.95 to 1 for Japan. \n5  The structure of Thailand\u2019s electricity supply industry known as a single-buyer model where the state-owned \nenterprise\u2014the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand\u2014is a major power producer, a single buyer, and the \noperator of the transmission network. Under this single-buyer arrangement, the Electricity Generating Authority of \n ", "2   \n \n5.  On  the  demand  side,  the  Energy  Conservation  and  Promotion  Act  of  1992  is  the \nprincipal regulatory framework for energy efficiency programs in Thailand. Under the act, the \nEnergy Efficiency Revolving Fund (EERF) was established in 2003 to stimulate investments in \nenergy efficiency projects.6 The EERF provides capital at no cost to participating Thai banks \nwhich, in turn, provide low-cost loans for energy efficiency projects. As of mid-2008, the EERF \nhad  financed  more  than  200  energy  efficiency  projects  totaling  nearly  $300  million  in \ninvestments, yielding an estimated $110 million in energy savings per year. The projects funded \nby the EERF have predominantly been private factories and, to a lesser extent, buildings, such \nas hospitals and hotels. \n \n6.  While  demand-side  management  for  energy  conservation  is  gaining  traction  in \nThailand\u2019s industrial, commercial, and residential sectors, efforts to promote energy efficiency \nmeasures at the municipal level have been lacking. The EERF, for example, has not financed \nany municipal energy efficiency projects. Additionally, energy service companies in Thailand \nprimarily market their services to private clients who own industrial and commercial enterprises. \nWhile the Clinton Climate Initiative has launched a building retrofit program in partnership with \nthe  Bangkok  Metropolitan  Administration,7  mainstreaming  energy  efficiency  measures  in \nsecondary  cities  can  yield  additional  energy  and  cost  savings,  improve  Thailand\u2019s  energy \nsecurity, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n7.  Because  PEA  provides  electricity  services  to  more  than  1,000  cities  and  towns \nthroughout Thailand, it can play a key role in promoting energy efficiency at the municipal level.8 \nMore than 65% of all electricity consumed in Thailand is within PEA\u2019s service area. In terms of \ngeographical coverage, PEA distributes electricity to 99% of the country and has more than 900 \nsuboffices throughout 73 provinces. Municipalities across the country are increasingly seeking \nPEA\u2019s advice on retrofitting public buildings to conserve energy and reduce electricity costs.9 \nBecause PEA provides significant subsidies for municipal street lighting, it has a strong financial \nincentive to replace outdated and inefficient lighting systems.10   \n \n8.  The potential for municipal building retrofits and street lighting improvements to save \nenergy and yield financial benefits to both municipalities and PEA provides the cornerstone for \njoint efforts to mainstream energy efficiency measures. Preliminary estimates suggest that a \n10% improvement in the energy efficiency of municipal buildings and public street lighting would \nresult in annual electricity cost savings of $27 million. A 20% gain in energy efficiency would \nyield annual cost savings of $53 million. This 10%\u201320% reduction in electricity consumption at \nthe municipal level is about 6%\u201313% of the total value of Thailand\u2019s annual electricity imports.  \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \nThailand is the only buyer of electricity from multiple suppliers, i.e., the independent private power producers and \nneighboring countries. The distribution and retailing functions are the exclusive responsibility of two state-owned \nenterprises\u2014the Metropolitan Electricity Authority and PEA. \n6  The EERF is managed by the Ministry of Energy\u2019s Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency.  \nAfter nearly 6 years of operation, the size of the EERF has grown to $126 million. \n7  The Clinton Climate Initiative is working with energy service companies and banks to design and finance retrofit \nprojects for both municipal and privately owned buildings in the city of Bangkok. \n8  PEA is a state-owned enterprise under the Ministry of Interior that distributes and sells electricity in a service area \nthat encompasses the entire country with the exception of Bangkok, Nonthaburi, and Samut Prakarn provinces, \nwhich are serviced by the Metropolitan Electricity Authority. \n9  In Thailand, this savings in energy costs directly translates into additional fiscal capacity for municipalities, thereby \nproviding financial resources to cover other municipal expenses. \n10  It is estimated that PEA provides an annual subsidy of $20 million for electricity used in municipal street lighting. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.   Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is designed to improve Thailand\u2019s energy security and decrease the rate of \ngreenhouse gas emissions by promoting energy efficiency initiatives in Thai municipalities. A \nkey outcome will be the strengthened capacity of PEA and municipalities to identify, design, \nfinance, and implement energy efficiency measures. The pilot energy efficiency projects to be \nlaunched under the TA will include retrofitting municipal buildings and upgrading public street \nlighting. The TA outputs will include (i) design and implementation of pilot municipal energy \nefficiency projects, (ii) innovative project financing arrangements; (iii) a plan for expanding and \nscaling-up of municipal energy efficiency projects throughout Thailand, and (iv) capacity building \nfor PEA and municipalities to replicate and mainstream energy efficiency measures. \n   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The methodology of the TA is based on four key activities that will directly contribute to \ndesired outputs and outcomes. One municipality will be selected from each of PEA\u2019s four \nservice regions based on predefined criteria.11 In each of the four participating municipalities, \nthe consultants and counterpart staff from PEA and the local municipality will identify potential \npilot energy efficiency projects in two categories: (i) retrofitting municipal buildings; and (ii) \nupgrading public street lighting.12 The results and lessons from the demonstration program will, \nin  turn,  serve  as  the  basis  for  replicating  municipal  energy  efficiency  projects  and  for \nstrengthening the capacity of PEA and municipalities to mainstream energy efficiency measures. \nThe four key activities of the TA are described below. \n  \n11.    Design  and  Implement  Pilot  Municipal  Energy  Efficiency  Projects.  Upon  the \nselection of the four municipalities to participate in the TA, the consulting team and PEA staff \nwill identify potential energy efficiency pilot projects in each municipality. Project selection will be \nbased on initial techno-economic studies that assess the potential for achieving energy savings \nand financial benefits from implementing energy efficiency measures. The pilot energy efficiency \nprojects will then be subject to detailed design and feasibility assessments that will involve \nconducting energy audits, recommending specific investments, calculating payback periods, \nand identifying how management changes and no-cost or low-cost options can reduce energy \nconsumption and yield financial savings. A methodology and indicators for measuring and \nverifying the benefits of energy efficiency projects will be defined, along with a time-bound \nimplementation  plan.  The  demonstration  program\u2019s  components,  costs,  benefits,  and \nimplementation arrangements will be incorporated into a demonstration program agreement to \nbe signed by PEA officials and the mayors from each participating municipality. The consulting \nteam  and  PEA  will  proceed  to  implement  the  pilot  energy  efficiency  projects,  undertake \nmonitoring and verification, and document the process into a handbook for future replication in \nother Thai municipalities. \n \n                                                 \n11 Such criteria will include, but not be limited to, a municipality\u2019s demonstrated interest and willingness to participate, \nits ability to provide counterpart human and financial resources, its level of outstanding receivables with PEA, and \nthe capacity of PEA\u2019s local area office to provide implementation support. \n12 Preferred municipal buildings will be central administration buildings; retrofits will focus on improvements to lighting \nand air conditioning systems, including the installation of switches and voltage regulators coupled with a staff \nawareness campaign. The upgrading of municipal street lighting will include the replacement of inefficient lighting \ntechnologies such as fluorescent lights, incandescent bulbs, and low-pressure mercury vapor lamps in central city \nareas; a demand-side management component will include the installation of timers and voltage regulators. \n ", "4   \n12.  Structure  Innovative  Project  Financing  Arrangements.  The  consulting  team  will \nstudy  various  financing  models  appropriate  for  energy  efficiency  investments  in  Thailand, \nincluding the possibility of PEA serving as an intermediary for such financing. This analysis will \nascertain potential sources of concessional funding, including bilateral agencies and the Ministry \nof Energy\u2019s EERF. After reviewing applicable legal and regulatory provisions that may pertain to \nthe financing structure, the consultants will undertake consultations with PEA, municipalities, \nand other relevant parties and come to an agreement on the most efficient financing model. \nConsideration will also be given to the possibility of using grant funds sourced from the TA to \nreduce the incremental cost of more efficient technologies. Grant funds will be made available \non a cost-sharing basis with PEA and the municipalities, and serve to reduce the financial risk of \nparticipating  in  the  demonstration  program.  Once  the  appropriate  financing  structure  is \ndetermined, its specifications will be formally presented to PEA and municipal counterparts, and \nincorporated into the demonstration program agreement.  \n \n13.  Prepare a Plan for Replicating Municipal Energy Efficiency Projects. Laying the \nfoundation for replicating energy efficiency projects in Thai municipalities across the country is a \ncore  objective  of  the  TA.  Four  regional  workshops  will  be  conducted  to  showcase  the \nachievements and lessons from the pilot energy efficiency projects to municipalities in the four \nPEA service regions, as well as to government agencies, consultants, academic institutions, \nand other interested parties. The workshops will also be used to solicit input on replicating and \nscaling-up municipal building retrofit and street lighting improvement projects throughout the \ncountry. A national workshop will be held for mayors and other municipal officials to prepare for \na  nationwide  rollout  of  the  municipal  energy  efficiency  program.  Taking  into  account  the \nfeedback received at the various workshops, the consulting team will develop action plans and \nidentify potential funding sources for (i) replicating the municipal building retrofit program and \n(ii) scaling-up  the  public  street  lighting  improvement  program.  Because  the  upgrading  of \nmunicipal street lighting throughout the country will yield significant energy savings and reduce \nthe need for PEA to subsidize the cost of inefficient lighting systems, it may be possible to \nobtain  carbon  credits  through  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism.13 In  this  context,  the \nconsultants  will  examine  the  feasibility  of  preparing  a  nationwide  public  street  lighting \nimprovement  program  and  reducing  investment  costs  through  the  Clean  Development \nMechanism. \n \n14.  Strengthen the Capacity of the Provincial Electricity Authority and Municipalities \nto Mainstream Energy Efficiency Measures. This activity will emphasize a learning-by-doing \napproach in which the consulting team will work directly with counterparts from PEA and the \nmunicipalities to promote hands-on learning. Drawing upon the experiences and lessons from \nimplementing the demonstration programs, the consultants will prepare a business plan for \ninstitutionalizing and sustaining PEA\u2019s energy efficiency advisory services for municipalities. The \nbusiness plan will include an analysis of the municipal market for energy efficiency advisory \nservices,  an  organizational  structure  for  an  energy  efficiency  advisory  services  unit,  an \nassessment  of  staffing  and  skill  requirements,  a  marketing  plan,  a  listing  of  necessary \nagreements with clients, a budget for the next 5 years, potential sources of income, and the \napprovals and permits that may be necessary. In addition, the TA will support the preparation of \na communications and outreach program to promote energy conservation initiatives among \nresidential customers, commercial building owners, and to small- and medium-sized enterprises.  \n \n                                                 \n13 The Clean Development Mechanism is an arrangement under the Kyoto Protocol allowing industrialized countries \nwith a greenhouse gas reduction commitment to invest in projects that reduce emissions in developing countries as \nan alternative to more expensive emission reductions in their own countries. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,450,000 equivalent, of which $1,000,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund14 under the Clean Energy Financing \nPartnership Facility, and administered by ADB. The Government will finance the remaining \n$450,000 equivalent in-kind through the provision of counterpart staff, consultancy services, \noffice accommodation, and other support facilities and services. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3.   \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  PEA  will  be  the  executing  agency  (EA)  for  the  TA.  PEA  will  establish  a  project \nmanagement unit to be staffed by a project director and other PEA personnel with expertise in \nfinance, engineering, procurement, law, and public outreach. In each of the four participating \nmunicipalities,  dedicated  teams  from  PEA\u2019s  local  area  offices  and  from  the  municipal \nadministrations will be established to assist with data collection and the implementation of the \npilot projects. Energy efficiency equipment and technologies will be purchased in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), and handed over to \nthe EA and participating municipalities at no cost upon project completion. \n \n17.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  by  a  team  comprising  two  individual  international \nconsultants and a national consulting firm. The international consultants will consist of a team \nleader, who is an energy efficiency expert, and a project finance specialist. The firm will provide \na  multidisciplinary  team  comprising  eight  specialists.  ADB  will  engage  the  consultants  in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nThe international consultants will be selected on an individual basis and the national consulting \nfirm will be selected using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection method. Outline terms of \nreference for all of the consultants and specifications for deliverables are in Appendix 4.  \n \n18.  It is estimated that the duration of the TA will be 24 months, commencing in March 2009 \nand ending in February 2011. The first 12 months will be used to design and implement the \ndemonstration program, months 13\u201320 will entail data collection on the energy and financial \nsavings from the pilot energy efficiency projects, and months 21\u201324 will be used for conducting \nworkshops, finalizing the action plans for replicating municipal energy efficiency projects, and \npreparing the final reports. The individual international consultants will mobilize prior to the \nnational consulting firm to coordinate with PEA staff on setting up the project management unit \nand clarifying its functions, selecting the four participating municipalities, and undertaking initial \nassessments of the potential energy savings and financial benefits resulting from potential pilot \nenergy efficiency projects.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of Thailand to be financed on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund \nunder the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility for Mainstreaming Energy Efficiency \nMeasures in Thai Municipalities, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n14 Contributors: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nImprovement in  Energy elasticity target of 0.6 to 1  Energy statistics compiled by  Institutional and financial \nThailand\u2019s energy  achieved by 2020, representing a  the Ministry of Energy  support from the Ministry of \nsecurity and a  reduction from the current level of    Energy and PEA  \ndecrease in the rate  1.4 to 1.   \nCoordination and \nof greenhouse gas     \ncooperation between PEA \nemissions   A reduction of at least 2% in  Country-level compound \nand municipalities \nThailand\u2019s CO2/GDP indicator by  indicators compiled by the \n2020, as benchmarked against the  International Energy Agency   \n2006 level of 0.42.
