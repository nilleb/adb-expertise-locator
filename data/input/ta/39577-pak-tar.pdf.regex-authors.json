The Government of Pakistan has requested an Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan for \na second phase of the ongoing Bahawalpur Rural Development Project (BRDP).1 The proposed \nloan is included in the 2007 loan program in the Country Strategy and Program (CSP) Update \nfor Pakistan 2006\u20132008. The provincial government of Punjab has initiated preparatory works \nfor a second\u2013phase project in early 2005 and is carrying out its own feasibility study. To support \nthe Punjab government in preparing the loan project, ADB Management cleared a concept \npaper for a project preparatory technical assistance (TA) in September 2005.2 ADB conducted \nthe Fact-Finding Mission during 10\u201318 October 2005 to consult with the concerned provincial \ndepartments, local government authorities, local nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and \nBRDP beneficiaries. The Mission elaborated goals, impacts, outcomes, scope, implementation \narrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  of  the  TA,  based  on \nconsultations, which were agreed to with the Government. The TA design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The former Bahawalpur Division3 consisting of three districts (Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar, \nand Rahim Yar Khan) in southern Punjab is one of the least developed regions in Pakistan. \nBasic infrastructure is insufficient in the rural area where 78% of the 8.93 million population in \nthe three districts live. Many development indicators of the area, such as literacy, road access, \nvillage electrification, telephone connections, and infant mortality rate, are poor by provincial \nnorms.4 The region constitutes the cotton-wheat zone, which has the highest poverty incidence, \nestimated at 56% in 2002, among the agroclimatic zones of Pakistan.5 Bahawalpur and Rahim \nYar Khan are categorized as \u201chigh deprivation districts\u201d and Bahawalnagar is categorized as a \n\u201cmedium deprivation district\u201d in the Punjab Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, October 2003.6 \nThe  baseline  survey  carried  out  under  the  BRDP  in  1999\u20132000  estimated  that  54%  of \nhouseholds in the project area fell below the poverty line. The percentage has decreased over \nthe project period to 49% in 2005, as estimated by the benefit monitoring and evaluation (M&E) \nstudies. Inadequate basic infrastructure is a major constraint to economic growth and poverty \nreduction in the area. Skewed land distribution in the cotton-wheat zone and lack of nonfarm \nemployment opportunities also contribute to limited chances for landless and marginal farmers \nto exit from poverty.  \n \n3.  The ongoing BRDP has been addressing lack of rural infrastructure (roads, irrigation, \nelectrification) and promoting social mobilization for community-based development in this poor \narea. In total, 600 kilometers (km) of rural roads will be improved (492 km has been completed \nto date), 475 villages will be electrified (391 to date), 684 watercourses have been improved, \nand 560 community organizations, including 192 women\u2019s organizations, have been mobilized \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1996.

The BRDP has \nbeen implemented successfully, except for start-up delays in the initial 3 years until 1999. The \nM&E surveys estimate that about 1.2 million people have benefited from the BRDP through \nimproved  infrastructure  and  community-based  income-generating  activities.  In  particular, \nwomen\u2019s community activities have made significant changes in the attitude of women in this \nconservative rural area, involving poor women in training, nonformal education, and income-\ngenerating activities. It is reported that some women\u2019s community organizations expanded their \nactivities  on  their  own  initiative,  and  organized  NGOs  to  help  other  groups.  The  BRDP \ninterventions are highly regarded among the target people and local governments on account of \nthe participatory approach, efficient implementation, and effective outcomes.  \n \n4.  The midterm impact study carried out in December 2001 reported quantitative impacts. \nOn average, (i) 425 people directly benefited from each kilometer of rural road rehabilitation; \n(ii) 117 people directly benefited and 1,102 people indirectly benefited from each subproject for \nsmall-scale infrastructure, with incremental annual income of PRs3,234 ($55.7) per household \nand an economic internal rate of return of 18% for each investment; (iii) 49 households per \nvillage were newly connected to the power supply, which contributed to incremental financial \nassets of about PRs1,000 ($16.7) per household as a result of increased income opportunities; \nand  (iv) 293  people  benefited  from  the  improvement  of  each  watercourse,  with  annual \nincremental  income  of  PRs1,857  ($31.1)  per  household.  The  study  also  carried  out  a \nparticipatory assessment of qualitative impacts of the four components and showed that the \nbeneficiaries  recognized  significant  or  highly  significant  positive  impacts  on  their  livelihood \nactivities. \n \n5.  The  experience  and  lessons  from  BRDP  implementation  show  that  (i) adequate \npreparation of the project implementation arrangements and full support of the provincial, district, \nand subdistrict (tehsil) governments are essential for timely implementation of project activities; \n(ii) although the selection criteria for subprojects that require at least two thirds of beneficiaries \nto be below the poverty line were generally adequate in reaching poor people, focusing more on \npoverty-stricken  pockets  in  the  area  will  improve  effectiveness;  (iii) provision  of  core \ninfrastructure (roads and electrification) can effectively benefit the targeted poor population; and \n(iv) due to the vastness of the project area (45,588 km2) and rural population (6.97 million in \n2004), the impacts of BRDP on the regional macroeconomy are less visible, leaving a large \nscope for further development activities. The dispersed BRDP activities over the large area \nwere caused mainly by considering a balanced distribution of subprojects among 14 subdistricts \nin the project area. As a result, despite the BRDP interventions, the project area remains \nbackward  in  terms  of  development  indicators  and  density  of  infrastructure,  compared  with \nprovincial averages. \n \n6.  Because of the achievements of the ongoing BRDP, the existence of vast remaining \nundeveloped  rural  areas,  and  strong  requests  from  local  governments,  the  Government \nrequested  ADB  to  provide  further  assistance  to  finance  a  follow-on  phase  II  project.  The \nproposed project is consistent with ADB\u2019s current CSP for 2002\u20132006 that supports sustainable \npro-poor growth for rural development and employment generation as one of the three specific \nintervention  areas.  The  CSP  Update  for  2006\u20132008  approved  in  September  2005  also \nemphasizes lending for infrastructure development. \n \n7.  The Government is strongly committed to poverty reduction, focusing on the poor and \nproviding them with increased economic opportunities and greater access to physical and social \n ", "  3\nassets as expressed in its poverty reduction strategy,7 as well as in the partnership agreement \nwith ADB.8 The provincial poverty reduction strategy assigns priority to addressing rural poverty \nthrough higher financial allocations, improving physical infrastructure and access to physical \nassets, and balanced regional development. The proposed project, therefore, is consistent with \nthe poverty reduction strategies of the federal and provincial governments, as well as that of \nADB. \n \n8.  Apart from the nationwide poverty reduction programs, such as the Kushal Pakistan \nProgram,  Pakistan  Poverty  Alleviation  Fund,  and  Civil  Community  Board,  there  exists  no \nspecific project or program on the scale of the BRDP in the project area. Rural infrastructure is \nbeing provided by the ADB-financed Punjab Community Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \nProject9 and the Government-funded National Program for Improvement of Watercourses. Only a \nfew rural roads in the project area are being improved or will be improved under the Punjab Road \nSector Development Project.10 Delivery of local government services is being supported through a \nseries of ADB program loans that support, among others, decentralization of the administration \nsystem.11  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The ensuing Bahawalpur Rural Development Project, Phase II (BRDP II) will reduce \npoverty by providing backward rural areas with basic infrastructure, such as roads and electricity \nand promoting community-based social and economic activities. The TA will help the provincial \ngovernment of Punjab prepare a project design report for BRDP II that contains the rationale, \nscope, cost estimates and financing plan, implementation arrangements, resettlement planning \ndocuments, and social and environmental assessments to ensure that the project is technically \nsound,  economically  viable,  financially  sustainable,  and  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \nrequirements. The project area will remain the same as that of the BRDP, covering the entire 14 \nsubdistricts in the three districts comprising Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur, and Rahim Yar Khan.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  will  build  upon  the  provincial  governments\u2019  feasibility  study  and  will  be \nimplemented on the basis of extensive consultations undertaken with the rural population and \nthe achievements realized under the BRDP. Under BRDP II, the project interventions will focus \nmore on the most poverty-stricken pockets, rather than equally distribute activities over the \nproject area. The design will also be consistent with the decentralized local government system, \ncompared with the BRDP that was designed prior to devolution. Project preparation work under \nthe  TA  will  be  guided  by  the  following  principles:  (i) the  focus  is  on  addressing  the  key \n                                                 \n7  Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, December 2003, http://www.adb.org/Documents/Poverty/pa_pak.pdf \n8  Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement between the Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the \nAsian Development Bank, September 2002, http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2004/cr0424.pdf \n9  ADB. 2002.

The TA will focus on the envisioned BRDP II interventions, which will include three \ncomponents:  (i) improvement  of  core  rural  infrastructure, (ii) promotion  of  community-based \neconomic and social activities and small-scale infrastructure development, and (iii) institutional \nstrengthening. The first component will include improvement and upgrading of existing rural \nroads and village electrification.12 The second component will include community mobilization, \ncapacity building for enhancing skills, a nonformal literacy program for women, and provision of \nmatching seed investment for income-generating activities, and small-scale infrastructure, such \nas brick pavement of short roads, and minor water supply and sewerage facilities. Women, \nlandless tenants, and sharecroppers will be particular targets of this component. The third \ncomponent will include project management, and capacity building of district authorities for \nplanning, implementation, and operation and maintenance of rural infrastructure, and other \nservices such as veterinary services. The scope of the ensuing project will be elaborated during \nthe TA. The subproject selection criteria that have been applied to the BRDP will be reviewed \nfor their relevance and effectiveness in addressing poverty reduction, and will be modified to \nmeet the changing needs and environment. Appendix 2 gives the initial poverty and social \nanalysis of BRDP II. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $375,000 equivalent. ADB will finance a total of \n$300,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nThe Government will provide the remaining cost of $75,000 equivalent. Detailed cost estimates \nare in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing project. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 5 months, commencing in January 2006 and ending in \nJune 2006. ADB will engage individual consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of \ndomestic  consultants.  All  procurement  under  the  TA  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. The TA will require 15.0 person-months of consulting services: 10.0 international \nand 5.0 domestic. The TA will be led by an international rural development specialist with \n                                                 \n12 Improvement of  watercourses that was a component of the BRDP is being undertaken under the ongoing \ngovernment-funded National Program for Improvement of Watercourses, and therefore, would not be considered \nunder BRDP II. \n ", "  5\nexperience in working for poverty-focused rural development projects in Pakistan and/or other \nSouth Asian countries. Two additional international consultants will provide inputs in the fields of \nsociology and resettlement, and economic analysis and project financial planning.

The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  are  in \nAppendix 4.  \n \n14.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Planning and Development Department of \nthe government of Punjab (P&DD). The responsibility for TA implementation will be delegated \nfrom P&DD to the project management unit (PMU) of the BRDP, which is under P&DD. The \nPMU will be responsible for coordinating with other departments of the provincial government \nand district governments, while coordination with the federal government will be made through \nP&DD. The PMU will provide necessary support to the TA consultants in performing their work, \nincluding office space, and access to information and project field sites. The project director of \nthe BRDP will serve concurrently as project manager for the TA, and PMU staff will serve as \ncounterpart  staff  who  will  work  together  with  the  consultants  to  implement  the  TA.  The \nGovernment has agreed to (i) appoint one qualified staff as a full-time TA coordinator and \nsupporting staff as required; (ii) provide transportation means within Bahawalpur town and for \nfield work; (iii) provide office space within the PMU, utilities, furnishings, and communication \nfacilities for the consultants; (iv) assist the consultants in collecting data and information needed \nto carry out their assignments, and in conducting consultation meetings and workshops; and \n(v) prepare rural road development and M&E plans that will constitute a part of the project \ndesign report (PDR). Equipment procured under the TA will be turned over to P&DD and will be \nutilized for implementing the ensuing project. \n \n15.  The TA will deliver (i) a work plan containing a list of work items, milestones, and their \ntime frame within a week of the start of the services; (ii) an evaluation report of the BRDP that \nassesses  relevance,  efficacy,  efficiency,  and  sustainability,  and  lessons  learned  and \nimplications for the design of the follow-on project, within 1.5 months of the start of the study; \n(iii) an outline project design and subproject selection criteria report for each component, within \n2.5 months of the study; (iv) a draft PDR containing the project rationale, design and monitoring \nframework,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  operation  and  maintenance  plan, \nresettlement planning documents, social and environmental assessments, and all other works \nundertaken under the TA, within 4 months of commencing the services; and (v) a final PDR, \nwithin 1 month after receiving Government and ADB comments on the draft report. The reports \nwill be submitted to ADB, PMU, and P&DD in hard and soft copies.

Many \nsocioeconomic indicators of the area, such as literacy ratio, road length per area, village electrification rate, telephone \nconnection rate, rate of population with safe water supply, are below the provincial averages. The region constitutes \nthe cotton-wheat zone, which has the highest poverty incidence, as high as 56%, among the agroclimatic zones in \nPakistan (October 2003). The ongoing Bahawalpur Rural Development Project (BRDP) has been successfully \naddressing  lack  of  rural  infrastructure  (roads,  irrigation,  electrification)  and  promoted  social  mobilization  for \ncommunity-based development in this poor area.
