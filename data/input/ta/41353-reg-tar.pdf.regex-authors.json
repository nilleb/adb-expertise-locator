The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) is one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing subregions \nin  economic  development.  Investments  in  infrastructure,  especially  transport  corridors,  are \nimproving physical connectivity and regional integration, while cross-border agreements are \nfacilitating  the  movement  of  goods  and  people  across  borders.  Improved  connectivity  and \nregional integration also mean increased vulnerability to the spread of HIV, especially along \nnewly developed transport corridors, in cross-border areas and new economic corridors.  \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has a commitment to promoting economic growth \nand poverty reduction in the GMS through the three \u201cCs\u201d\u2014improving connectivity, enhancing \ncompetitiveness, and promoting community.1 Consistent with this strategy, ADB financing for \ninfrastructure projects in the GMS is increasing, particularly in road-related economic corridors. \nRecognizing the links between connectivity and the spread of HIV, ADB is also committed to \nfighting HIV in the region, particularly as that risk may be heightened by the development of \ntransportation and other infrastructure.2  \n3.  The commitment to economic development, poverty reduction, and HIV prevention in the \nGMS is shared by the Government of Australia.3 Given ADB\u2019s experience with the design and \nimplementation of HIV prevention packages in association with infrastructure development, \nparticularly  in  road  construction,  the  Government  of  Australia  is  partnering  with  ADB  to \nstrengthen and expand these activities in the GMS. The proposed technical assistance (TA) will \nsupport  HIV  prevention  activities  to  be  implemented  in  connection  with  ADB-financed \ninfrastructure projects. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4  \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The  HIV  epidemic  is  well  established  in  the  GMS.  While  the  epidemic  varies  in \nprevalence and nature between countries, it continues to threaten economic growth and poverty \nreduction across the region. HIV prevalence is highest in Cambodia (1.9% among those 15\u201349 \nyears)  and  Thailand  (1.4%)  and  increasing  in  Viet  Nam  (0.5%),  driven  largely  by  sexual \ntransmission and injecting drug use. Within countries, HIV hot spots are common, especially \nalong land and water transport routes. The Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) \nremains a low-prevalence country (0.1%) but with a steadily growing epidemic and particular \nvulnerability in transport corridors and cross-border areas.5 \n5.  Migration, mobility, and the spread of HIV are closely linked. Mobile men with money\u2014\ncommonly referred to as \u201cthe 3Ms\u201d\u2014are a major force in the ongoing spread of HIV in the \nregion. HIV is spread through high-risk behaviors such as unprotected sex and the sharing of \ncontaminated needles by injecting drug users. Increases in HIV prevalence have been observed \nalong major transport routes, in cross-border areas, and in regions experiencing high seasonal \nand long-term population mobility. Large infrastructure projects, including the building of airports, \nrailways, ports, power infrastructure, and roads, offer economic opportunities that attract migrant \nworkers, commercial retailers, and entertainment industries to previously remote communities. \nMany contributing factors make the workers and populations associated with infrastructure \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Although these factors vary with the sociocultural and \neconomic context, some common risk situations are:  \n(i)  Construction  personnel. Loneliness and disconnection from community and \nfamily; disposable income that can readily be used on sex, alcohol, and drugs; \naccessibility of sex workers (formal and informal).  \n(ii)  Truck drivers. Separation from families and home for extended periods; long \nwaiting times for clearances in border areas; accessibility and availability of sex \nworkers; use of drugs to cope with the long hours of driving.  \n(iii)  Female sex workers. Unequal bargaining power to negotiate condom use; few \nalternative income opportunities; lack of knowledge to prevent infection; lack of \naccessible health facilities for sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and \ntreatment;  lack  of  protection  from  authorities;  vulnerability  of  being a  female \nmigrant or being mobile. \n(iv)  Local  communities around  construction  sites. Loss of livelihoods, loss of \nincome, and displacement due to resettlement; opportunities for transactional sex \nwith  migrant  workers  for  material  benefits  (e.g.,  clothes,  food);  disruption  of \ntraditional values and social systems, particularly in ethnic minority areas. \n6.  Possible  HIV  prevention  interventions  that  can  be  implemented  with  infrastructure \nprojects include: educational and behavior change communication campaigns; social-marketing \nof condoms; testing and case management for STIs; voluntary counseling and testing for HIV; \nharm reduction options for injecting drug users (e.g., needle exchange programs); capacity \ndevelopment  of  government  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  local \norganizations; and anti-trafficking and safe migration initiatives, particularly for women. The \ninterventions must be multisectoral and responsive to differences in risk related to gender and \nethnic groups.  \n7.  Over the past 15 years, ADB has supported several HIV prevention projects in the GMS, \nsome of them in association with infrastructure projects. Outputs have ranged from economic \nanalyses of the poverty impact of a growing epidemic6 to support for community-based HIV \nprevention actions in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam with a focus on sites and areas that \nreceive transient mobile populations or long-term migrants, large construction sites, and source \ncommunities of migrants.7 In more recent years, GMS projects have supported the development \nof  targeted  prevention  messages  to  ethnic  minority  communities  especially  in  remote  and \ncross-border  areas,8 a  youth-focused  project  in  Viet  Nam,9 and  a  regional  communicable \ndisease control project.10 The projects have expanded the knowledge base for actions in these \nareas  and  provided  ADB  with  experience  in  effective  regional  and  country-level  HIV \nprogramming.  \n                                                 \n6  ADB and UNAIDS. 2004.

In 2007, ADB reviewed its program of HIV activities and developed a new GMS HIV \nstrategy and framework to guide future operations (see footnote 2). The strategy identifies \nADB\u2019s comparative advantage in the GMS to be HIV prevention in the context of infrastructure \ndevelopment. As a major financier of infrastructure in the subregion, ADB has the obligation to \nmitigate  the  HIV  risks  associated  with  infrastructure  development  and  the  opportunity  to \ncontribute strategically to fighting HIV in the subregion. While previous interventions delivered \ngood results and evaluations were positive, the proposed initiative adopts a more focused, \ncoherent, and programmatic approach that is more directly linked to, and closely aligned with, \nthe overall GMS program and core infrastructure operations. This enhanced effort to integrate \nHIV prevention actions into major infrastructure projects builds on previous GMS experience \nand seeks to better target affected communities, the construction workforce, and ultimately road \nusers. This work is complemented by other TA work on practice reviews and the piloting of new \napproaches11 and collaboration with development partners to improve practices and advocate \nmore integrated and streamlined approaches.12  \n9.  To date, HIV prevention actions have been largely confined to the construction period. \nFinancing for pre- and post-construction initiatives has not been available, given the nature of \nADB loan operations. Initiating actions in the pre-construction period, such as resilience-building \nmeasures  in  local  communities,  will  strengthen  risk  mitigation  efforts  during  construction. \nSimilarly, HIV prevention programs should continue in a modified form in the post-construction \nperiod, when the risks and target groups change as roads come into use and migration and \nother economic opportunities grow. The proposed TA will enable ADB to extend support for HIV \nprevention initiatives beyond the construction period to include the pre- and post-construction \nphases. Further, it will enable the development of knowledge, skills, and in-country capacity for \ndesigning  and  implementing  sustainable,  comprehensive,  multisectoral  HIV  prevention \nresponses in the context of infrastructure development projects. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The proposed regional TA will contribute to achieving Millennium Development Goal \n(MDG) 6, Target 7, to \u201chalt and begin to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS\u201d in the GMS by 2015.13 \nThe outcome will be a reduced incidence of HIV transmission and prevalence of other STIs in \ncommunities  and  population  groups  directly  associated  with  ADB-financed  infrastructure \ndevelopments in the GMS. Key outputs will be: (i) enhanced leadership support and institutional \npolicies  for  addressing  HIV  risks  in  the  context  of  infrastructure  projects;  (ii)  improved \nawareness of  HIV,  AIDS,  and  STI  among  key  target  groups  in the  infrastructure  settings; \n(iii) improved access to HIV and STI prevention commodities; (iv) reduced incidence of HIV risk \nbehaviors among key target groups; (v) improved access to HIV and STI treatment and testing; \nand (vi) improved surveillance and associated knowledge products.  \n                                                 \n11 ADB.  2006.

The principles guiding all risk mitigation actions highlight the importance of working \nthrough the national AIDS authority (or its equivalent) and supporting cross-border collaboration \nand evidence-based design (Appendix 2). The collection of gender-disaggregated data at the \ncommunity  level  will  facilitate  appropriate  targeting  of  vulnerable  groups  including  ethnic \nminorities. A gender action plan is in Appendix 3. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The proposed activities under the regional TA are grouped into two components: (i) HIV \nprevention interventions associated with infrastructure projects; and (ii) knowledge management, \nmonitoring, evaluation, and regional coordination.  \n  1.  Component 1: HIV Prevention Interventions in the Infrastructure Sector \n13.  This component will support a set of distinct subprojects associated with ADB-financed \ninfrastructure projects in the GMS. The subproject sites represent a range of HIV risk contexts in \nthe pre-construction, construction, and post-construction phases in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and \nViet Nam. An indicative list of subprojects is in Appendix 4. With more funding, the scope could \nbe expanded to other infrastructure subsectors, such as energy.14 \n14.  Activities will be designed to ensure a targeted, site- and risk-appropriate HIV mitigation \nresponse in association with each construction project. While the emphasis and allocation of \nresources will vary with the risk environment, the proposed TA subprojects will generally consist \nof the following four areas of activity: \n(i)  Advocacy  and  capacity  building. Targeting stakeholders at the local level, \nincluding government leaders, health services, and local NGOs in border areas \nwith information and skills-building opportunities. \n(ii)  Information,  education,  and  behavior  change  communications. Targeting \nthe  workforce  of  infrastructure  projects,  sex  workers,  road  users,  and  local \ncommunities. The activities will be aimed at increasing awareness and changing \nbehaviors  in  relation  to  HIV  and  STI  transmission,  and  providing  preventive \ncommodities (e.g., condoms) through social-marketing and other mechanisms. \n(iii)  Strengthening of medical services. Including measures to improve quality and \naccess to HIV and STI testing, and treatment and care services, for construction \nworkers,  sex  workers,  and  affected  communities,  as  well  as  HIV  and  STI \nmonitoring and surveillance where necessary. \n(iv)  Monitoring  and  evaluation. With attention to collecting data consistent with \nnational monitoring systems and disaggregated according to gender and ethnic \nminority  group,  to  refine  actions  as  projects  move  from  pre-construction  to \nconstruction and then to the post-construction period. \n15.  Detailed  designs,  with  a  subproject-specific  design  and  monitoring  framework  and \ngender framework, will be developed in stages and subject to peer review as part of the annual \nreviews  with  the  Government  of  Australia.  NGOs  are  expected  to  be  key  implementation \npartners. The subprojects listed in Appendix 4 include the following, among others: 15 \n                                                 \n14  The Government of Australia has indicated that, with satisfactory progress, additional funding may be provided to \nexpand the scope of the TA. \n15  Detailed designs for subprojects (i) and (ii) are available in Supplementary Appendixes A and B. \n ", "  5\n(i)  LAO:  Northern  Economic  Corridor  (Loan  1989).16 Road  upgrading  was \ncompleted in 2007 and included an HIV mitigation package implemented during \nthe  construction.  The  subproject  expands  this  package  with  condom \nsocial-marketing and targeted information campaigns in the post-construction \nperiod, to address emerging risks, particularly in the cross-border areas. \n(ii)  LAO/VIE: East\u2013West Corridor (Loan 1727/1728).17 The road construction was \nfinished in 2006 and included some HIV prevention activities for construction \nworkers and local communities. The proposed subproject will target road users \nespecially truck drivers, sex workers and their clients, and affected communities \nin  the  corridor  and  cross-border  area.  Activities  will  include  information \ncampaigns and enhanced health services. In communities where women and \nethnic minorities are at particular risk, interventions will be aimed at effecting \nbehavior change in the post-construction phase. \n2.  Component  2:  Monitoring,  Evaluation,  Knowledge  Dissemination,  and \nRegional Coordination \n16.  Component 2 will focus on coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and the production \nand  dissemination  of  knowledge  products  with  the  implementation  of  the  component 1 \nsubprojects.  The  HIV  prevention  interventions  associated  with  the  Cambodia/Viet  Nam: \nSouthern  Coastal  Corridor  Project 18  and  Lao  PDR:  Northern  GMS  Transport  Network \nImprovement Project,19 both cofinanced by the Government of Australia, will also be part of this \ncomponent. Reports on lessons learned during the design and implementation will be prepared, \nand outputs will support national and regional forums with key stakeholders and cross-border \ncollaboration.  Participants  at  the  forums  will  include  representatives  of  the  national  AIDS \nagencies and ministries of health and transport, NGOs, and other development partners. These \nforums will not duplicate other related regional forums but will complement and expand these in \nrelation  to  HIV  prevention  and  infrastructure  development.20 The  outputs  will  be  aimed  at \nimproving  practices  and  the  institutional  knowledge  and  structures  for  long-term  program \nsustainability through national policy and resource commitments in these areas. An indicative \nlist of subprojects and activities and the associated cost plan is in Appendix 4. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The proposed TA is estimated to cost $6,000,000. The TA will be financed with a grant \nfrom the Government of Australia to be administered by ADB.

Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the Executing Agency, and the proposed TA will be implemented through \nthe Social Sectors Division (SESS) of the Southeast Asia Department (SERD) from June 2008 \nto December 2011. Subprojects associated with infrastructure projects will be administered by \nthe Infrastructure Division of SERD with technical support from SESS staff and consultants. The \nspecific designs of subprojects under component 1 will be included in annual work programs, to \nbe  reviewed  and  agreed  on  in  accordance  with  the  agreement  between  ADB  and  the \nGovernment of Australia. A no-objection letter will be obtained before the start of TA activities in \nthe territory of the participating countries. \n19.  Consultant services will be required to develop, coordinate, and implement the proposed \nTA activities. SESS staff will oversee project implementation with support from a program \ncoordinator and a program assistant. A total of 60 international and 54 national person-months \nof individual consultant inputs, including inputs from monitoring and evaluation and gender \nspecialists, will be required. The consultant inputs are outlined in Appendix 6. To implement the \nsubproject activities, ADB will hire organizations or individual consultants, depending on the \ndesign of the subproject, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time), and procure goods and other services for the proposed TA \noperations according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nIV.
