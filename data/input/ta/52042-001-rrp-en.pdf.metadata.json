THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridors 2, 3, \nand 5 (Obigarm\u2013Nurobod) Road Project. \n \n2.  The project will improve connectivity and safety along the Obigarm\u2013Nurobod road by \n(i) constructing about 30 kilometers (km) of climate-resilient, two-lane highway between Obigarm \nand Tagikamar and about 30 km of all-weather village access roads, and increasing road safety \nawareness; (ii) strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Transport (MOT) on road \nasset management; and (iii) enhancing women\u2019s access to economic opportunities.1 The project \nexpands efforts of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners to \nupgrade the country\u2019s national highway network along key economic corridors. It will enhance \ninclusive economic growth and regional connectivity. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Regional  connectivity.  Tajikistan  is  landlocked  and  bordered  by  Afghanistan,  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan. The country has a gross \ndomestic product per capita of just $822, and about 30% of the population still lived below the \npoverty  line  in  2018.  Tajikistan  depends  heavily  on  its  road  transport  corridors  to  support \ninvestment, job creation, trade, and ultimately economic growth and poverty reduction. Almost \n70% of the population lives in rural areas, in a largely mountainous territory (90%) where only \n10% of the land is suitable for cultivation. The road transport subsector suffers from low quality, \nlong travel times, and poor reliability. Four Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nregional corridors (2, 3, 5, and 6) cross parts of Tajikistan, offering the opportunity for Tajikistan \nto enhance its connectivity and trade competitiveness. \n \n4.  Road subsector policy context. The development of the transport sector in Tajikistan is \nguided by the government\u2019s National Development Strategy and the Transport Sector Master \nPlan,2 and implemented through the State Program on Transport Sector Development, 2010\u2013\n2025. The Transport Sector Master Plan, developed with ADB assistance, is the basis for the \ngovernment\u2019s strategic sector planning. As such, it provides a framework for coordination among \ngovernment  bodies  and  development  partners.  The  State  Program  on  Transport  Sector \nDevelopment includes a list of short-, medium-, and long-term investments that is regularly \nreviewed and updated. \n \n5.  Tajikistan is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and has high exposure to natural \nhazards.3 In particular, mountainous areas face adverse and worsening conditions as a result of \nclimate change, with increased frequency of extreme precipitation events, avalanches, landslides, \nand mudflows. Accordingly, the government has prioritized and committed to reducing the risks \n \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided transaction technical assistance for the project: ADB.

Subsector performance. The road network under the MOT\u2019s jurisdiction totals 14,220 \nkm, comprising 3,348 km of international roads (24%), 2,128 km of national roads (15%), and \n8,744 km of local roads (61%). While most (85%) of the international roads are in good or fair \ncondition, about 48% of the national roads are in poor condition. The road network was largely \nconstructed  before  the  1970s,  and  the  rapid  increase  in  traffic  on  some  arterial  roads  is \nintensifying pressure on aging transport infrastructure. Travelling through and within Tajikistan \ncan be time-consuming, uncomfortable, and expensive, and disproportionately affects women\u2019s \naccess to jobs, markets, and public services. \n \n7.  The government has made recent efforts to improve road maintenance programming \nthrough the progressive development of a road asset management system under ADB and World \nBank financing. ADB has further supported the piloting of four performance-based maintenance \n(PBM) contracts that has increased participation of the private sector and improved maintenance \npractices. Apart from construction and PBM contracts, opportunities for private sector participation \nin  the  road  subsector  appear  to  be  rather  limited.  The  MOT  now  intends  to  gradually \ninstitutionalize road asset management system and PBM approaches to enable upscaling and \nalignment with the government\u2019s planning and budgeting processes. With regards to road safety, \nthe World Health Organization estimated that there were 1,577 road traffic fatalities in 2016, which \ncorresponds to about 18.8 fatalities per 100,000 people, compared with 15.4 fatalities per 100,000 \npeople in the Kyrgyz Republic.5 The government is in the process of developing guidelines on \nsafe arterial road design and implementing a national road safety program ($10 million) to improve \npriority road sections where crashes are occurring.6  \n \n8.  The backbone of the national road network has been largely improved with assistance \nfrom ADB and development partners.Since 1998, ADB has financed 10 transport projects totaling \n \nabout $600 million, most of which have been implemented by the Project Implementation Unit for \nRoads Rehabilitation (PIURR) under the MOT. ADB\u2019s investments have significantly contributed \nto (i) improving about 950 km of international and national roads on CAREC corridors and 350 \nkm of rural roads, (ii) strengthening capacities on road safety and asset management, and (iii) \nenhancing cross-border infrastructure and performance (particularly at the border with the Kyrgyz \nRepublic). ADB, together with development partners, will continue assisting the government in \nimplementing the Regional Road Safety Strategy for CAREC Countries and advancing the asset \nmanagement agenda through continuous policy dialogue and priority sector reforms.7 \n \n9.  Obigarm\u2013Nurobod  road.  The  Obigarm\u2013Nurobod  road  section  of  the  existing  M41 \nhighway is located at the confluence of CAREC corridors 2, 3, and 5. This 75-km-long road \nconnects Dushanbe to the northeast region of Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, and carries \nabout 2,000 vehicles per day. The existing road will be inundated once the Rogun hydropower \nplant reservoir has filled to operating levels. The realignment of this road section is not part of the \nRogun hydro power plant project. A bypass road must be completed and opened to traffic by \n \n4  ADB. 2018.

No other part of Tajikistan\u2019s national \nhighway network can provide for this traffic, and the only alternative route would entail a deviation \nof about 320 km. \n \n10.  The  government  has  requested  the  assistance  of  ADB,  the  Asian  Infrastructure \nInvestment Bank (AIIB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and \nthe OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) to construct a safe and climate-resilient, \ntwo-lane road restoring connectivity between Obigarm and Nurobod. The road has been divided \ninto three sections: (i) the Obigarm\u2013Tagikamar section is about 30.0-km long and includes two \ntunnels of 1.6 km and 1.7 km and village access roads (section 1; hereinafter referred to as project \nroads; to be financed by ADB and OFID); (ii) the Tagikamar\u2013Nurobod section is about 44.0-km \nlong and includes one 2.6-km tunnel, one long temporary bridge, and village access roads \n(section 2; to be financed by the EBRD); and (iii) a 760-meter (m) long bridge and its approaches \n(section 3; to be financed by the AIIB). \n \n11.  Strategic fit. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and supports four of its \nseven operational priorities: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities (para. 41); \n(ii) accelerating progress in gender equality (para. 42); (iii) tackling climate change, building \nclimate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability (para. 29); and \n(iv) fostering regional cooperation and integration (para. 3).8 Improving the project road is a \ngovernment priority, as reflected by its inclusion in the country operations business plan for \nTajikistan, 2019\u20132021.9 The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nTajikistan,  2016\u20132020,  which  aims  to  improve  physical  connectivity  and  enhance  regional \nintegration.10 The project will also contribute to the goals of CAREC 2030 and the forthcoming \nCAREC Transport Strategy, 2030 by improving connectivity and competitiveness along three key \neconomic corridors.11 \n \n12.  Lessons learned. The country assistance program evaluation for Tajikistan, 1998\u20132013 \nrated ADB\u2019s transport sector and trade facilitation successful.12 Out of the last three project \ncompletion and validation reports (2014 and 2018), two projects were rated successful while one \nproject was rated less than successful. Lessons from completed and ongoing projects include the \nneed to (i) foster climate change and disaster risk activities into the country development agenda; \n(ii) enhance the integration of road safety, gender-sensitive, and socially inclusive features in \nproject designs; and (iii) prioritize sustainability of investments and continue strengthening the \nMOT\u2019s capacities. These lessons have been incorporated into the design of the project in synergy \nwith ADB and other development partners interventions. \n \nB.  Project Description \n13.

The project will have the following \noutcome: connectivity and safety along the Obigarm\u2013Nurobod road improved.13 \n \n14.  Output  1:  Project  roads  constructed,  and  road  safety  awareness  increased. \nThis output will include the construction of (i) about 30 km of climate-resilient, two-lane highway \nbetween Obigarm and Tagikamar; and (ii) about 30 km of all-weather village access roads that \nwill serve 11 villages. The project roads will include safety facilities fitted for the elderly, children, \nwomen, and differently abled. This output will also include the development of a gender-sensitive \nroad safety awareness campaign targeting roadside villages and schools. \n \n15.  Output 2: The MOT\u2019s institutional capacity on asset management strengthened. \nThis output will include (i) the development of tailored tolling options and preparation of priority \nand viable tolling projects; (ii) the development and dissemination of annual statistics and \nanalytics on the road network under the MOT\u2019s jurisdiction; and (iii) training of selected MOT and \nGovernment Automobile Road Establishment staff (50% of whom will be women) on tunnel \noperation and management, including climate change and disaster risk management. \n \n16.  Output 3: Women\u2019s access to economic opportunities enhanced. This output will \ninclude (i) designing and implementing a women\u2019s entrepreneurship program, (ii) training women \non  business  development  and  financial  management,  and  (iii)  facilitating  access  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s targeted grants for women entrepreneurs. The delivery of this output will involve \nclose  coordination  with  the  National  Committee  of  Women  and  Family  Affairs,  and  local \nauthorities. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n17.  The size of ADB\u2019s transport sector portfolio, coupled with its leading role in the CAREC \ntransport  program,  has  positioned  ADB  to  successfully  support  the  government\u2019s  sector \nstrategies, policies, and projects. A number of knowledge products were developed through ADB \nregional and advisory technical assistance projects, including the Transport Sector Master Plan \n(2011), which laid the groundwork for the development of the State Program on Transport Sector \nDevelopment, 2010\u20132025 (para. 4). \n \n18.  Through the project, ADB will help the government in (i) ensuring that adequate features \non  gender,  climate  change  adaptation,  disaster  risk  management,  and  road  safety  are \nincorporated into the engineering design; (ii) structuring the project and mobilizing cofinancing \nresources ($230 million) to  ensure  effective  and  timely  implementation  of the  project;  and \n(iii) advancing the road asset management agenda to improve sector sustainability (para. 34). \n \nD.

ADB  will  finance  the  expenditures  in relation  to  civil  works,  consulting \nservices, and contingencies. The government has also requested OFID to provide a loan of \n$40 million, which will exclusively cofinance the works contract for the construction of the \nObigarm\u2013Tagikamar road section as collaborative cofinancing. ADB will not administer the OFID \nloan. Each cofinancier will manage, in close coordination, its own pro rata share of disbursements \nfor payments related to the cofinanced contract. \n \n21.  The government will contribute $28.1 million to cover taxes and duties, land acquisition \nand  resettlement  costs,  incremental  administrative  costs,  and  financing  charges  during \nimplementation. ADB and OFID will not finance taxes. The government has agreed to secure all \ncounterpart funds required for the smooth and effective implementation of the project, including \nany shortfall of funds or cost overruns, and to ensure that all such funds are released in a timely \nmanner. \n \n22.  In addition, the government has requested loan financing from the EBRD ($150 million) \nand the AIIB ($40 million) to help finance the construction of other sections of the Obigarm\u2013\nNurobod road (para. 10).

The project\u2019s procurement readiness is high, given that the three main contracts \nwill be procured through advance contracting.16 The government has been advised that advance \ncontracting does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2019\u2013June 2024 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2024 \nEstimated grant closing date  31 December 2024 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  Ministry of Transport \n(ii)  Implementing unit  Project Implementation Unit for Roads Rehabilitation \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding  1 contract  $125,000,000 \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  2 contracts  $5,850,000 \nIndividual consultant selection  1 contract  $75,000 \nLeast-cost selection  1 contract  $75,000 \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting will be applied for civil works and consulting services. Any \napproval of advance contracting will not constitute a commitment by ADB to \nfinance the project. \nDisbursement  The grant proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: ADB. \n \n25.  ADB and OFID will cofinance a single works contract for the construction of the project \nroads. ADB will be the sole financier of the consulting services contracts. Universal procurement \nwill only apply to the single cofinanced contract. All contracts will be procured in accordance with \nthe ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations \nfor ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) will apply for the ADB and OFID cofinanced section. During project implementation, ADB \nand OFID will jointly supervise and monitor the environmental and social aspects of the road \nconstruction. A memorandum of understanding will be signed between ADB and OFID, which will \nset out the terms and conditions under which cofinancing will take place with respect to the road \nconstruction. \n \n26.  A project coordinating committee (PCC) will be established and will meet regularly to \nreview project overall progress across all three road sections and help resolve any issues related \nto project interfacing. While the PCC will serve as a coordinating platform, it will not have an \noversight role with regard to the project\u2019s specific legal or contractual matters. The government \n \n15 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 A bid for civil works was invited in August 2019 and a bid for expressions of interest for consulting services in \nSeptember 2019. \n ", "7 \nwill  set  out  the  PCC\u2019s  roles  and  responsibilities  in  cooperation  with  project  cofinanciers. \nThe project management consultant (PMC) team will include a technical advisor and contract \nmanagement specialist who will provide technical and secretarial support to the PCC. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n27.  Road design. The road alignment will follow an alignment that was defined originally in \nthe 1980s. Design alternatives to minimize the number and length of tunnels and bridges were \nconsidered and assessed. Reflecting the difficult terrain, the design of the Obigarm\u2013Tagikamar \nroad section provides for two tunnels (total length of 3.3 km) and six bridges (total length of 470 \nm). The road cross-section will be nominally two traffic lanes each 3.5-m wide with 2.5-m surfaced \nshoulders. This cross-section will be adequate for the traffic of about 6,500 vehicles per day that \nis projected to use the road up to the end of the economic evaluation period in 2048. Road \npavements will be flexible with asphaltic concrete surfacing. The tunnel, road, and bridge designs \nhave been prepared in accordance with appropriate design standards and take into account the \nadverse climatic conditions that exist in the project area. \n \n28.  Road safety. The road design meets internationally accepted standards and practices in \nterms of road safety, and the design review team included an international road safety specialist. \nRoad safety audits will be carried out before and during construction, and prior to final acceptance \nof the completed road. The road safety audits will be conducted in close coordination with the \ntraffic police and relevant government agencies. The road design also reflects consultations with \ncommunities living adjacent to the road, which have resulted in the inclusion of several village \naccess roads and crossing places for people and livestock, with appropriate signs and markings. \n \n29.  Climate change. A detailed climate risk assessment was conducted for the project road \nfor the period to 2050 to ensure that the design specifications are adequate for future climatic \nconditions (footnote 15). The frequency and magnitude of avalanches, floods, and landslides are \nlikely to increase, and about 5% of the project road drainage systems were found to have \npotentially  insufficient  capacity  under  future  extreme  precipitation  events.  These  drainage \nstructures will be reviewed by the construction supervision consultant (CSC) during project \nimplementation and their dimensions will be increased as appropriate. \n \n30.  The technical due diligence confirmed that the project road\u2019s technical design, alignment, \ncross-section, bridges, tunnels, drainage structures, pavements, and climate and road safety \nprovisions are appropriate for a road of this standard in this location, and for the volume of traffic \nthat is projected to use it. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n31.  The economic analysis of the project was undertaken using the highway development and \nmaintenance model and in accordance with ADB guidelines.17 Since the project is part of a \ncoordinated initiative involving multiple financing agencies (para. 10) and benefits are contingent \non completion of all sections, the economic analysis considered the 75-km road in its entirety. \nThe incremental benefits of reductions in vehicle operating costs, travel times, and emissions \nwere compared with the initial investment costs and changes in operation and maintenance costs \nover  a  30-year  appraisal  period,  comprising  5  years  for  implementation  and  25  years  for \n \n17 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "8 \noperation. Benefits which accrue to otherwise suppressed traffic (because of overly lengthy \ndiversions) were taken into account, as this is a main economic rationale of the project. \n \n32.  The project was found to be highly economically viable, with a benefit\u2013cost ratio of 3.7, an \neconomic internal rate of return of 24.6%, and a net present value of $605 million at a 9.0% \ndiscount rate. Sensitivity tests confirmed that the economic viability of the project is robust against \n(i) project cost increases of up to 366%, (ii) decreases in benefits of up to 27%, (iii) exclusion of \nbenefits  pertaining  to  trip  suppression,  (iv)  a  scenario  with  no  diversion  to  Karamyk,  and \n(v) a 2-year delay in project completion. The project will also help expand the regional benefits \nand cross-border spillovers supported by other ADB-assisted projects, including the improvement \nof (i) the Karamyk border crossing point at the Kyrgyz border,18 (ii) the Dushanbe\u2013Uzbekistan \nborder road,19 and (iii) the Dushanbe\u2013Kurgonteppa road.20 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n33.  The project is nonrevenue generating, although tolling options will be explored at the road \nnetwork level. The project road will be maintained under the government\u2019s maintenance program. \nAn assessment of the MOT\u2019s road asset management practices and capabilities was carried out \nduring  project  preparation.  During  2010\u20132019,  the  annual  budget  for  winter  and  routine \nmaintenance doubled, from TJS34.0 million to TJS68.0 million. The compounded growth rate for \nthe winter and routine maintenance budget was 7.2%, with an average annual inflation rate of \n6.7%.  The  annual  average  incremental  maintenance  costs  associated  with  the  project  are \nestimated to be in line with the current expenditure on international highways (about $2,000 per \nkm).  However,  the  current  budget  allocation  is  insufficient  to  meet  the  overall  network \nmaintenance needs, especially in relation to periodic maintenance. \n \n34.  Recognizing the need to further expand its revenue base, the government has sought \nassistance from development partners to gradually (i) set up a road asset management unit within \nthe MOT, (ii) establish a dedicated road maintenance fund, and (iii) introduce tolling on selected \nhighway sections. The government has agreed with ADB and development partners to develop \nand implement a 5-year road map (2020\u20132024), including the abovementioned measures, to \nimprove road maintenance and asset management across the road network.21 The road map will \nbe translated into a government decree (or other appropriate government action acceptable to \nADB), which should be adopted by June 2020. \n \n35.  The sustainability analysis concluded that, if these issues are addressed, the MOT has \nsufficient human and financial capacity, within the government\u2019s budgetary procedures, to meet \nrecurrent expenditures to adequately operate and maintain the project roads over the economic \nlife of the project. \n \n \n18 ADB. 2013.

The financial management assessment was undertaken in May \n2019  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.22  The  overall  inherent  risk  has  been  assessed \nsubstantial,  mainly  reflecting  the  findings  of  the  2017  public  expenditure  and  financial \naccountability assessment on country-specific risks related to internal audit. The overall control \nrisk has been assessed moderate because of (i) the slow improvement of process formalization \nand record keeping practices and (ii) the lack of regular internal audit by the MOT. The combined \npremitigation  financial  risk  assessment  is  therefore  assessed  substantial.  The  financial \nmanagement assessment further concluded that, if these issues are addressed, the PIURR has \nsufficient and appropriate financial management capacity to implement the project. The PIURR \nwill maintain adequate and separate project records and accounts, which will be audited annually \nby an independent auditor. \n \n37.  Procurement. A project procurement risk assessment (PPRA) was undertaken in April \n2019 in accordance with ADB guidelines.23 The PPRA considered the PIURR\u2019s capacity with \nregard to organization and staffing, information management, procurement practices, complaint \nand dispute resolution mechanisms, and accountability measures. The PPRA concluded that the \nprocurement risk is moderate because of (i) the growing portfolio of externally funded projects \nthat may lead to insufficient staffing within the PIURR and (ii) record management systems and \nprocedures that need further improvement. The PPRA concluded that, if these issues are \naddressed, the PIURR has sufficient and appropriate procurement capacity to implement the \nproject. \n \n38.  Procurement arrangements were made to achieve the best value for money. For the civil \nworks, because of the relatively limited size of the highway section (30 km), procurement will be \nconducted for one contract package (comprising all project roads) through open competitive \nbidding using the one stage, two envelope method and to be awarded to the lowest evaluated \nsubstantially  responsive  bidder.  For  each  of  the  main  consultant  services  (construction \nsupervision and project management services), the quality- and cost-based selection approach \n(90% for quality and 10% for cost) will be used. \n \n39.  Institutional capacity. The MOT and PIURR have an adequate understanding of ADB\u2019s \nprocurement and financial management policies and procedures as a result of the sizable portfolio \nof ADB-assisted transport operations (para. 8). The PIURR will be assisted during project \nimplementation by the PMC, the CSC, and relevant MOT departments.  \n \n40.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government, the MOT, and the PIURR. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 14). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n41.  Socioeconomic  surveys  and  gender  assessment  were  carried  out  during  project \npreparation, and a summary poverty reduction and social strategy was prepared.24 The project \narea can be characterized as a series of isolated mountain villages where the major economic \nactivities are agriculture and animal husbandry. Almost every household has some land and \n \n22 ADB. 2009. Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note. Manila; and ADB. 2005. Guidelines for the Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects.

At  jamoat  (subdistrict)  level,  official  data  shows  a  poverty  rate  of  about  13.5%. \nCommunity consultations revealed that the actual rate was likely much higher, as the process for \nregistering as a poor household is administratively cumbersome. The project will directly benefit \nabout 3,500 households located in seven roadside villages by improving access to jobs, markets, \nand public services while reducing road traffic fatalities and injuries. \n \n42.  The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The project will address the \ngender issues identified during project preparation, which include enhancing connectivity of the \nvillages through all-weather village access roads, increasing road safety features and awareness, \nand enhancing women\u2019s access to job and training opportunities. A gender action plan (GAP) was \nprepared in consultation with project beneficiaries and government officials.25 The GAP will \ninclude activities supporting (i) gender-responsive and socially inclusive design features across \nall infrastructure built under the project, (ii) affirmative measures to enhance women\u2019s access to \neconomic opportunities, and (iii) sex-disaggregated monitoring and reporting of project progress \nand achievements. The PMC team will include a gender specialist who will assist the PIURR in \nimplementing and monitoring the GAP. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n43.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategorization is A for environmental impacts, B for involuntary resettlement impacts, and C for \nindigenous  peoples.26  All  safeguard  documents  were  prepared  based  on  meaningful \nconsultations with affected people and communities endorsed by the government authorities, and \ndisclosed  on  the  ADB  website  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Access  to  Information  Policy.27 \nA stakeholder engagement plan was also developed during project preparation and will be further \nupdated throughout project implementation.28 \n \n44.  Grievance redress, monitoring, and reporting procedures have been agreed with the \nPIURR and specified in all safeguard documents. During project implementation, all safeguards \ndocuments will be updated as necessary, reviewed by ADB, and publicly disclosed. The project \nincludes adequate resources to implement and monitor environmental and social mitigation \nmeasures. The MOT and PIURR are experienced in implementing road projects with significant \nsocial and environmental impacts. The PIURR will be assisted by the CSC and PMC to manage \ngrievances and ensure compliance with the project\u2019s safeguard requirements, and will prepare \nsemiannual safeguards monitoring reports for ADB\u2019s review and disclosure. \n \n45.  Environment (category A). An environmental impact assessment and an environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) were prepared and disclosed on the ADB and MOT websites on 19 July \n2019. The main anticipated site-specific impacts during construction include air and surface water \npollution, noise and vibration, soil erosion, soil material disposal, loss or degradation of natural \nhabitat, occupational health and safety, relocation of utilities, and traffic disruption. The relatively \nshort-term nature of these impacts mean that generally impacts will not be significant if the EMP \nis implemented correctly. During the operation phase, the main anticipated residual impacts \ninclude those from noise on the overall landscape. An impact assessment was also conducted \nfor the village access roads. Adequate mitigation measures and monitoring requirements have \nbeen included in the EMP and will be implemented through the civil works contract and monitored \nthrough the CSC and PMC contracts. The EMP will be updated into a site-specific EMP by the \n \n25 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n27 ADB. 2018.

No physical works \nwill be allowed prior to approval of the site-specific EMP by the CSC and PIURR. \n \n46.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). A land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) \nwas prepared and disclosed on the ADB and MOT websites in August 2019. The census carried \nout during project preparation identified 62 households (502 people) that will be affected directly \nby land acquisition for the project. Nine households with 68 people will experience severe impact \non  their  livelihoods.  These  include  four  households  losing  their  residential  buildings,  one \nhousehold losing more than 10% of its productive agricultural land, three petrol station workers \nlosing their employment, and one business losing its main building and operating business. A total \nof 29 households have been classified vulnerable. All affected people will receive adequate \ncompensation in accordance with the provisions included in the LARP. The village access roads \n(typically 5-m wide) will be designed to the extent possible on their existing alignments to have \nminimal resettlement impacts. An impact assessment was conducted for the village access roads \nbased on a preliminary design, and was included in the LARP. When the detailed design is \nfinalized, a LARP addendum will be prepared, approved, and implemented prior to displacing \naffected people and commencing the works. \n \n47.  Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no indigenous peoples in the project area \nas defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n48.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.29 The project risks are considered \nmanageable through the prescribed mitigation measures. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigation Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nInsufficient allocation of  The government, with support from the project cofinanciers (Asian Development \nfunds to maintain the  Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and \nproject roads and  Development, and OPEC Fund for International Development), has agreed to \nfacilities  develop and implement a 5-year plan to improve road maintenance and asset \nmanagement across the road network. The government and the Asian Development \nBank have agreed on a covenant to ensure that the project road and facilities will \nreceive timely and adequate maintenance. \nLack of coordination to  A project coordination committee will be established prior to mobilization of the works \nfacilitate and manage the  contractors. The committee will meet regularly to review the overall project progress \ninterfacing of road  and resolve any issues that are relevant to the overall project across all three road \nconstruction  sections. These issues may be related to technical, safeguards, contractual, or \nschedule, aspects, or any other activities that could impact the successful \nimplementation of the overall project. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n49.  The government, MOT, and the PIURR have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  requirements,  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and grant documents.
