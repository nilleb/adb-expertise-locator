INTRODUCTION \n1.  Timor-Leste has requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help \ncoordinate capacity development and investment planning across infrastructure and to mobilize \nfinancial resources needed for infrastructure investment. The technical assistance (TA) will \nrespond to this request by helping Timor-Leste prepare and begin implementation of a long-term \nstrategic plan for its Ministry of Public Works (MPW). Fact-finding took place in October 2012.1 \nThe  government  has  concurred  with  the  TA\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework of the TA is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Timor-Leste has initiated a new development phase based on converting revenue from \noffshore petroleum into human and physical capital. Efforts are being guided by the Timor-Leste \nStrategic  Development  Plan  (SDP),  2011\u20132030.  The  plan  identifies  an  ambitious  list  of \ninfrastructure projects, and calls for the front-loading of implementation during its first 5 years.2 \nA  national  electrification  program  is  nearing  completion, two  additional  telecommunications \noperators have been licensed to expand telecommunication services and reduce prices, and \nmajor investments are under way or in preparation for most other infrastructure sectors. More \nthan $3 billion in infrastructure investment has been budgeted for 2012\u20132017.3 \n3.  The surge in infrastructure investment is placing large demands on the government\u2019s \ninfrastructure agencies and their qualified staff, who are in short supply. At the same time, \nTimor-Leste has embarked on an assertive upgrading of human capacity through additional \nskills. The departure of experienced Timorese for further studies has the immediate effect of \nadding to skill shortages.  \n4.  The government is outsourcing key activities to ensure that infrastructure services are \ndelivered despite capacity shortages within government agencies. Outsourcing is made feasible \nby the financial resources provided by petroleum revenue, and is essential if the development \ngoals  of  the  SDP  are  to  be  achieved.  The  SDP  provides  for  the  use  of  public\u2013private \npartnerships (PPPs) where they offer value for money; the PPP policy and law are in place, and \npathfinder PPPs are in preparation. \n5.  Reforms  have  been  made  to  facilitate  the  surge  in  infrastructure  investment.  The \nConselho de Administra\u00e7\u00e3o do Fundo Infraestrutura (infrastructure fund council), chaired by the \nPrime Minister and including key ministers, has been established to provide overall leadership \nto  infrastructure.  The  council\u2019s  secretariat\u2014the  Major  Projects  Secretariat\u2014oversees  new \nbusiness processes adopted for major projects. The secretariat also has a planning role for the \ninfrastructure sectors, is responsible for PPPs, and is the executing agency for all loan-financed \nprojects. The procurement of projects costing more than $1 million is the responsibility of the \nnew National Procurement Commission, which is assisted by an independent procurement \nagent, and the recently established National Development Agency is engaged in the approval \nand quality control of infrastructure projects.  \n6.  Under the new business processes, line agencies implement major projects, and have \nadded responsibilities for mid-sized projects (i.e., projects costing from $0.25 million to $1 \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 November 2012. \n2  Government of Timor-Leste. 2011. Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan, 2011\u20132030. Dili. \n3  An overview of the status of the infrastructure sectors is provided in ADB. 2012. ADB Dili Bulletin. July. \n ", "2   \nmillion).4 To improve efficiency, in July 2012 the Ministry of Infrastructure was separated into \ntwo ministries: the MPW and the Ministry of Transport and Communications. \n7.  Development partners have responded by aligning their activities with the SDP and \nscaling up by their support for infrastructure. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 is \nhelping the government fast-track development by supporting the upgrade of the country\u2019s \ninfrastructure and complementary initiatives.5 Other key development partners in infrastructure \ninclude the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), the European Union, the \nInternational Finance Corporation, Japan International Cooperation Agency, the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, and the World Bank. \n8.  The  government\u2019s  new  approach  to  major  projects  is  still  being  refined.  There  is \nconsiderable room for improvement via the clarification of sector plans and the responsibilities \nof agencies, and by streamlining project preparation (e.g., combining approvals) and key steps \nin  project  administration  (e.g.,  the  processing  of  contractor  claims).  The  expansion  in \ndevelopment support is creating extra demands by bringing their systems and processes into \nuse. In keeping with the international commitments to aid effectiveness, these need to be \nintegrated with the new government systems. For example, project management units need to \nbe seamlessly integrated within ministries, and potential conflicts in procurement practices need \nto  be  avoided.  In  this  increasingly  complex  environment,  a  clear  vision  of  best  practices, \nprocesses, and systems is needed to ensure sound infrastructure investment. \n9.  These rapid changes are taking place against a record of poor sustainability. Many \nrehabilitated assets have fallen into disrepair well before the end of their design life. Unless \nsustainability is improved, some of the current surge in investment spending may be wasted. \nAchieving sustainability will rest on the strengthening of government agencies, building the \ncapacity of their staff, ensuring adequate recurrent cost financing and sound operating and \nmaintenance practices, and securing broad ownership of new initiatives.  \n10.  The  major  road  upgrades  supported  by  development  partners  include  extended \nmaintenance contracts, thereby outsourcing this essential function. With ADB support, a short \nperiod of operation and maintenance is being combined with the upgrade of the water and \nsanitation systems in two district capitals. While these approaches offer quick solutions, a long-\nterm solution is still needed. \n11.  The governance arrangements for the providers of power, water and sanitation, port, \nand airport services are a further challenge. Service providers lack the autonomy needed to \noperate along business lines; e.g., they are dependent on the government budget for funding, \nstaff are employed under standard civil service arrangements, and regulatory and operating \nroles are yet to be separated. Some operate as sections of a ministry. Modernized management \napproaches  that  provide  incentives  for  and  an  ability  to  achieve  efficiency  improvements, \nsubject to checks and balances, would increase the returns from the facilities they manage. \n12.  Although the need for TA for infrastructure agencies is increasing, key ADB TA projects \nare winding down: Infrastructure Project Management; Strengthening Major Public Investments \n(which supports the Major Projects Secretariat); and the Results-Based Project Management for \nPacific Developing Member Countries.6 Even with the ADB TA for Strengthening Water Sector \n                                                \n4  Special arrangements are in place for small infrastructure projects (i.e., projects costing up to $0.25 million). \n5  ADB. 2011.

Technical Assistance ", "  3 \nManagement and Service Delivery and assistance available from other development partners, \nthe overall value of TA for infrastructure agencies is declining.7 \n13.  The new investment projects supported by development partners can meet some of the \nneeds. For example, they can provide opportunities for on-the-job training for inexperienced \nprofessionals, and trial ways of streamlining of systems and processes. Externally supported \nprojects  have  a key  role  to  play  as  a  catalyst  of  change.  But  such support  needs  to  be \ncomplemented  by  a  higher-level,  strategic  perspective  that  provides  overall  guidance  to \ninfrastructure management. This complementary support can only be provided through TA, \nwhich  is  essential  to  ensure  that  the  surge  in  infrastructure  investment  will  meet  quality \nstandards, provide value for money, and be sustainable. \n14.  The TA will strengthen the higher-level systems and processes needed for effective and \nsustainable infrastructure management. The TA will help the MPW prepare a long-term strategic \nplan that will set out the results targeted in the road transport, water and sanitation, and power \nsectors, and how these targets will be achieved. The plan will emphasize capacity development. \nAssistance will also be provided to guide implementation and monitoring of the strategy.  \n15.  The TA will be the first of two phases of support. The proposed second phase will \nsupport implementation of priority initiatives of the MPW strategic plan, and will be prepared as \nthe strategic plan nears completion. The second phase will also consider replicating the support \nin other infrastructure agencies where assistance is needed. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The impact will be the delivery of sustainable roads and bridges, water and sanitation, \nand  power  infrastructure.  Performance  will  be  measured  by  budget  execution  rates,  the \nprovision of adequate funds for maintenance of major roads, and the initiation of infrastructure \nPPPs. The outcome will be strengthened infrastructure management by the MPW. Performance \nwill be measured by progress in implementing the long-term strategic plan for the MPW, which \nwill be prepared with the support of the TA. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  The TA will provide two outputs: (i) a long-term, results-based strategic plan for the \nMPW,  and  (ii)  an  operational  capacity  development  framework.  The  strategic  plan  will  be \nconcluded by the end of 2013, and will integrate the capacity development framework. The TA \nwill subsequently support the initial implementation and monitoring of the strategic plan and the \ncapacity development framework. The TA will focus on infrastructure investments larger than \n$0.25 million. \n18.  The MPW strategic plan will help implement the Timor-Leste SDP and the MPW action \n                                                                                                                                                       \nto the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for Strengthening Major Public Investments.

Manila (TA 7981-TIM). \n ", "4   \nplan for 2013\u20132017 prepared in response to the program of the fifth constitutional government.8 \nThe SDP and MPW action plan focus on what is to be done, and provide only general guidance \non how it will be done. They need to be backed up by a management approach focused on \nresolving hurdles to success in implementation and in achieving sustainability. This will be put in \nplace through the MPW strategic plan. \n19.  The MPW strategic plan will articulate the major development challenges and desired \nresults for roads and bridges, water and sanitation, and power. It will identify sector priorities, \nand spell out in broad terms the projects, programs, and other interventions needed to achieve \nthe priorities. Gaps that need to be filled will be identified. For example, the MPW strategic plan \nis expected to identify the system changes needed to make investment sustainable (e.g., the \nestablishment of maintenance regimes, independent management structures for utilities, and \nuser charging policies).  \n20.  The capacity development framework is a critical input to the MPW strategic plan. To \ngive sufficient emphasis to capacity development, it will be prepared through a separate but \nlinked  process.  The  framework  will  set  out  how  the  MPW  and  its  staff  can  develop  the \nknowledge,  abilities,  and  systems  necessary  to  implement  a  results-based  management \napproach and improve performance. It will help staff develop new capacities that will allow them \nto cope with change at a personal level and empower them to be part of a new, higher \nperformance agency. A baseline assessment of capacity and a map of the sequenced actions \nrequired  to  help  agencies  and  individual  staff  achieve  the  target  level  of  capacity  will  be \nprovided. \n21.  Progress against the MPW strategic plan and the capacity development framework will \nbe  reported  publicly  to  enhance  the  public  accountability  of  infrastructure  investment  and \nfacilitate the engagement of external stakeholders. The frameworks will provide a vehicle to \nincorporate key issues into infrastructure planning, such as the achievement of gender equity. \nThey  will  also  provide  a  focus  for  development  coordination  to  improve  alignment  and \nharmonization  in  the  infrastructure  sectors,  with  all  development  partners  encouraged  to \nparticipate in their preparation and application. \n22.  Key assumptions of the TA include strong ownership and input by the MPW and other \ninfrastructure agencies in preparing a strategic plan for the MPW, and the capacity of the \ngovernment\u2019s  planning  and  budget  systems  to  accommodate  results-based  management \napproaches.  The  TA  also  assumes  that  a  consensus  will  emerge  on  the  best  long-term \napproach to capacity development, and that stakeholders including development partners are \nactively engaged. The key risks are that high project workloads will divert attention from new \nmanagement  approaches,  and  that  new  approaches  to  infrastructure  management  prove \ndifficult to integrate with established operating practices. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n23.  The TA is estimated to cost $510,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and office accommodation and other in-kind \ncontributions. A cost estimate and financing plan is provided in Appendix 2. \n                                                \n8  Presidency  of  the  Council  of  Ministers.  2012.  Program of  the  Fifth  Constitutional  Government:  2012\u20132015 \nLegislature. Dili. ", "  5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n24.  The MPW, through its Directorate of Corporate Services, will be the executing agency. \nThe MPW will provide overall guidance to the TA and ensure alignment with the government\u2019s \nplans. ADB will be the implementing agency. ADB\u2019s Special Office in Timor-Leste will be the \nfocal point for the TA and be responsible for coordinating TA activities on a day-to-day basis.  \n25.  The TA will require up to 38 person-months of consulting services, provided by a team \nleader (national, full-time, 24 person-months), a capacity development adviser (international, \nintermittent, 4 person-months), a results-based management adviser (international, intermittent, \n4 person-months), and engineer(s) (national, intermittent, total of 6 person-months). The team \nleader will establish reporting and coordination arrangements with the MPW. The two advisers \nwill provide most of their input by the end of 2013, and return periodically to Timor-Leste to \nassist  in  implementation  and  monitoring.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  individual \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. \n26.  To  provide  for  flexibility  and  timeliness  in  recruitment,  international  and  national \nconsultants will be selected and engaged by ADB on an individual basis in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements \nunder the TA will be  made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n27.  The TA will collaborate with other development partner activities, most notably those of \nAusAID,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  the  World  Bank,  and  the  International \nFinance Corporation. A coordination committee, cochaired by the key infrastructure agencies \nand development partners, will be established to guide support for capacity development and \nresults-based  management  in  the  infrastructure  sectors.  The  team  leader  will  assist  this \ncoordination committee by acting as its secretariat. Where elements of the MPW strategic plan \nare being put in place or implemented through other development assistance, such as ADB \nsupport for the water and sanitation sector, the TA will play a secondary role. \n28.  The TA will support awareness-raising events for stakeholders within government and \npublic awareness-raising events for stakeholders outside government. These events will provide \nan opportunity to explain TA activities to stakeholders; receive feedback on performance; and \ndisseminate  good  practices,  knowledge  products,  and  lessons.  The  government  website, \nnotably the Timor-Leste Transparency Portal, will also be used as a key vehicle for information \ndissemination.9 To assist monitoring and evaluation, quarterly updates on TA progress and \nissues will be submitted by the team leader to the MPW and ADB. Other partners supporting \nrelated initiatives will be invited to participate in the midterm and final reviews of the TA. \n29.  The TA will commence on 15 January 2013 and be completed on 31 December 2014. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n \n30.

Overview \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) consultants will help the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) \nprepare a long-term strategic plan that will set out results targeted in the road transport, water \nand  sanitation,  and  power  sectors,  and  how these targets  will  be  achieved.  The  plan  will \nemphasize  capacity  development.  The  TA  consultants  will  also  help  the  MPW  guide \nimplementation and monitoring of the strategy. \n2.  Support for preparing the strategic plan will draw on the successful trial of the managing \nfor development results approach with the National Directorate for Water Supply of the Ministry \nof Infrastructure.1 The TA consultants will help the MPW work with other line agencies and \ncentral agencies engaged in infrastructure in a process developed through the TA for Results-\nBased Project Management for Pacific Developing Member Countries.2  \n3.  The TA consultants will support adoption of a broad concept of capacity development, \nsuch as that presented in the Practical Guide to Capacity Development in a Sector Context of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), which describes capacity development as the process of \nchanging toward results.3 The guide highlights that, as capacity development takes place in \npeople and organizations, it has to be owned and cannot be imposed on them. In addition, as \ncapacity  development  must  arise  from  the  environment  or  from  internal  factors,  external \npartners cannot \u2015do\u2016 capacity development of others; they can only support or help to create the \nright external incentives for capacity development processes. \n4.  The TA consultants will draw on the capacity development framework outlined in Closing \nCapacity Gaps in Timor-Leste, specifically the six steps to capacity development.4 It will also \ndraw on the insights from the staged capacity building model of the Australian Agency for \nInternational  Development  (AusAID).5 The  capacity  development  framework  will  pay  close \nattention  to  lessons  from  ADB  assistance  to  Timor-Leste,  including  those  from  AusAID\u2019s \nindependent review of the Infrastructure Project Management TA.6 \n                                                \n1  Managing for development results helps organizations align internal policies, practice, and behavior with targeted \nexternal results. The approach can be separated into three stages: (i) being clear about the results that an \norganization has to deliver, the problems that face it, and the gaps in its performance; (ii) identification of the \nchanges an organization has to make to deliver results\u2019 and (iii) implementation of a change management process, \nwhich is monitored to improve the management of the organization and to improve performance.
