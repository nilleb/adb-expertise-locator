I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Gansu  Tianshui  Urban  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Project.1 \n \n2.  The project aims to promote balanced and environmentally sustainable urbanization, \nand to improve living conditions in Tianshui, a second-tier city in Gansu province, PRC. It will \nsupport the restructuring and expansion of the Qinzhou district heating network; construction of \nurban roads and bridges, and related services such as better flood control; and stronger urban \nmanagement capacity.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Gansu  province  has  the  PRC's  second-lowest gross  domestic  product  per  capita\u2014\nTianshui municipality\u2019s 3.6 million inhabitants include 640,000 urban dwellers in Qinzhou and \nMaiji districts with an estimated urban poverty rate of 13.5% (2009).3 Development barriers \ninclude  poor  infrastructure  and  Gansu's  remote  inland  location.  Transport  links  are  being \nimproved  through  expressway  and  rail  construction,  and  in  July  2009  the  State  Council \napproved the establishment of the Guanzhong-Tianshui Economic Zone (GTEZ). By 2020, the \nGTEZ is intended to become the northwest PRC's economic backbone. Specific objectives are \nthe  promotion  of  economic  reform,  creation  of  an  open  economic  zone,  and  transport \nimprovements  for  all,  thereby  attracting  investment  and  corporations.  Tianshui\u2019s  urban \npopulation will increase as rural migrants seize economic opportunities in the GTEZ. The influx \nof industries and migrants will pressure Tianshui\u2019s infrastructure. \n \n4.  Although positioned as an economically developed, environment-friendly, and livable \ncity, Tianshui faces urban development challenges. These include poor district heating and air \nquality, seasonal flooding, and inadequate urban transportation. The rationale for the project is \naddressing these urban development challenges and so enabling Tianshui to meet urbanization \npressures and maximize GTEZ-related benefits. \n \n5.  District heating. The many small-scale boilers of Tianshui\u2019s Qinzhou district are energy-\ninefficient.  During  winter,  pollutants  from  these  coal-fired  boilers  and  single-family  heating \nstoves lessen air quality. Poor service quality and limited heating coverage especially affect \nwomen and the urban poor\u2014for instance, women are more likely to have higher exposure to \npollutants from heating stoves. Inefficiencies also undermine the financial sustainability of the \nTianshui  Heating  Company  (THC),  Qinzhou  district\u2019s  main  heating  provider.  The  China \nHuaneng Group intends to pipe recycled wastewater to a combined heat and power plant (CHP) \nto be constructed outside Tianshui.4 After cooling the CHP\u2019s boilers, the recycled hot water will \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The project was prepared through ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the \nGansu Tianshui Urban Infrastructure Development Project. Manila (TA 7344-PRC). \n3  Bulletin on 2009 Tianshui National Economic and Social Development Statistics provided by the Tianshui Municipal \nStatistics Bureau. By comparison, 4.2% of the PRC's rural population was living below the national poverty line in \n2008 (ADB. 2010. Basic Statistics 2010. Manila). \n4  China Huaneng Group will finance and construct the CHP and transmission pipelines, which have been deemed \nassociated facilities for the purposes of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The Tianshui Municipal \nGovernment is coordinating with the China Huaneng Group on construction timing and assurances have been \nagreed regarding these arrangements. ", "2 \n \nbe returned to Qinzhou district for winter heating. With the support of the proposed project, the \nTianshui Municipal Government (TMG) will commission new distribution capacity, close 199 \ncoal-fired  boilers,  and  restructure  the  heating  sector.  This  will  improve  energy  efficiency, \noperational effectiveness, and quality of district heating services. The proposed reforms will \nsubstantially increase district heating coverage, reduce annual coal use by 252,000 tons, and \nlower annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 428,000 tons. \n \n6.  Flood  control.  Beyond  air  pollution challenges,  the Xi  and Wei  rivers  converge  in \nTianshui and flood seasonally. The project will promote climate change adaptation through flood \ncontrol measures\u2014the annual probability of seasonal flooding along the Chengji road flood \nembankment is expected to fall from 10% to 1%.  \n \n7.  Urban  transport. Further, Tianshui's urban population grows by over  4% annually. \nInadequate facilities for public transport and nonmotorized transport (NMT), and poor traffic \nmanagement and traffic safety worsen slow urban road development. The project will construct \nroad  and  bridge  infrastructure,  and  related  services,  to  improve  transportation for  all. The \nproposed holistic road design and road safety audit, urban transport planning system, and \nmanagement  and  maintenance  will  improve  safety,  traffic  and  parking  control,  and  driving \nbehavior.  These  measures  will  boost  transport  efficiencies  and  safety,  improve  Tianshui\u2019s \nlivability and ability to benefit from the GTEZ, while coping with more industry and a larger \npopulation. \n \n8.  Strategic fit and sector experience. The project will support the PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-\nYear Plan, 2011\u20132015, which targets energy conservation, carbon dioxide emission reductions, \nand regional development, particularly in the western region. The project components comprise \npart of the 2020 Tianshui City Master Plan, which the Gansu Provincial Government approved \nin July 2009, and TMG investment programs. The project also aligns with the PRC country \npartnership  strategy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).5 It  conforms  to  ADB\u2019s Water \nPolicy,6 which encourages water conservation, including wastewater reuse. It supports ADB\u2019s \nurban  sector  strategy  and  the  PRC's  urbanization  strategy,  which  promote  rural\u2013urban \nintegration  and  infrastructure  investments  in  dynamic  settlements.  It  also  supports  ADB\u2019s \nClimate Change Program7 through reduced GHG emissions from coal-fired heating boilers and \nlower vehicle emissions per trip. ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative8 will inform the design of \nurban  road  components  and  related  institutional  and  capacity  development  assistance,  for \ninstance  through  support  to  improve  facilities  for  NMT.  ADB-financed  urban  development \nprojects in the PRC generally perform well. This will be ADB's third urban development project \nin Gansu province, and the first foreign-financed urban development project in Tianshui. The \nproject design reflects lessons from previous ADB-financed urban development projects in the \nPRC, including the need for early support on ADB policies and procedures\u2014interventions have \nbeen  particularly  effective  when  they  were  part  of  well-conceived  and  broader  urban \ndevelopment  master  plans  and  sector  master  plans,  and  were  accompanied  by  capacity \nbuilding to strengthen management and implementation capacity. \n \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2008\u20132010. Manila. ADB\u2019s existing strategy \nidentifies urban infrastructure development as a priority investment sector. Sustainable and low environmental \nimpact urban development is expected to continue to be a focal area in the new country partnership strategy \n(2011\u20132015) that is under preparation. \n6  ADB. 2001.

The project has the following demonstration features: (i) Multiple \nwastewater reuse\u2014in an innovative application of circular economy (reduce, reuse, recycle) \nprinciples, Tianshui\u2019s wastewater will be recycled and piped to a CHP, where it will be used for \ncooling purposes. The resultant hot water will be piped back to Qinzhou district, where it will be \nused during the winter season for district heating. (ii) Increased affordability of heating\u2014reusing \nwastewater for district heating will reduce the need for municipal subsidies, enable tariff levels to \nbe held constant in the medium term, and improve affordability for the poor. (iii) Holistic urban \nroad design and road safety audit\u2014a holistic approach to urban road design will improve access \nto NMT facilities. An audit of selected project roads and bridges will ensure infrastructures are \ndesigned and constructed to best-practice road safety requirements. (iv) People-centric urban \ntransport planning\u2014an urban road network planning system based on a geographic information \nsystem will improve TMG\u2019s ability to plan and manage the urban road network to meet rapidly \nevolving urban development and traffic demands. Planning and management systems will be \nestablished for NMT and parking, including prioritizing integrated facilities for pedestrians and \nbicycles  and  as  feeders  to  public  transport,  and  regularizing  street-parking  policies  and \nenforcement.  (v)  Urban  infrastructure  management  and  maintenance  system\u2014this  will \nsignificantly  enhance  road  maintenance  planning,  prioritization,  funding,  and  monitoring. \n(vi) Grievance-redress mechanism\u2014mandated by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), \nthe environment-related project grievance-redress mechanism was designed through intensive \nconsultation with the authorities and the public. The resultant structures and procedures have \nbeen embraced and are already used as a model for other ADB-financed projects in the PRC. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The project\u2019s impact will be better living conditions in Tianshui municipality. The intended \nproject  outcome  is  improved  heating,  transport,  and  flood  control  services  in  Tianshui \nmunicipality. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.

DUE DILIGENCE \n16.  The  project  will  directly  benefit  about  670,000  people  in  Tianshui  municipality  by \nimproving living conditions, reducing airborne pollution, improving protection from flooding and \nassociated hazards, and improving urban transport connectivity.11 \n \nA.  Technical \n17.  The  project\u2019s  heating,  flood  control,  and  road  components  will  be  designed  to \naccommodate seismic events. Mitigation measures will be designed into cut and fill slopes, \nbuilding foundations and structures, road pavements, and other infrastructure. Holistic road \ndesign and safety design considerations will be incorporated into road components, including \nenhanced traffic markings and signage, pedestrian lanes, bus stops, protection barriers, and \nstronger safety education and traffic safety management. The flood control component will also \nsupport  climate  change  adaptation\u2014the  Chengji  road  and  flood  control  embankment  was \nrealigned to minimize potential landslide risk. A detailed description of components is in the \nPAM. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n18.  The  economic  analysis  evaluated  technical  options  and  confirmed  that  the  project \ncomponents are the least-cost options in support of Tianshui\u2019s long-term development plans. \nThe  economic  internal  rates  of  return  were  computed  at  15.2%  for  the  district  heating \ncomponent, 16.2% for the Chengji road and flood control component, and 18.2% for the urban \ntransport improvement component, all of which exceed the economic opportunity cost of capital \nof 12%. The results are robust relative to the normal range of sensitivity analyses. Economic \ncosts include (i) capital costs such as land acquisition and resettlement, and environmental \nmitigation  and  monitoring  costs;  (ii)  project  management  and  institutional  strengthening; \n(iii) physical  contingencies;  and  (iv)  operation  and  maintenance  costs.  Economic  benefits \nidentified for the district heating component include (i) savings from greater energy efficiency \nthrough  reduced  coal  consumption,  (ii)  environmental  improvement  resulting  from  lower \nenvironmental costs due to reduced pollutant emissions, and (iii) incremental economic benefits \ncomputed as the difference between the centralized district heating system proposed for the \nproject and the existing small-community heating boilers. Economic benefits identified for the \nChengji road and flood control component and urban transport improvement component include \n(i) flood risk reductions, (ii) savings in vehicle operating costs, (iii) time savings, (iv) accident \ncost reductions, and (v) emission reductions. Not readily quantifiable benefits such as better \nhealth and increased employment were not included.12 \n                                                \n11  The project beneficiaries include 640,000 urban residents of whom about 87,000 or 13.5% are poor. District \nheating will benefit 345,000 people, and urban roads and flood control will benefit 671,200 people. There will be \n345,300 common beneficiaries. \n12 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n \n19.  A financial cost\u2013benefit analysis of the revenue-generating district heating component \nconfirmed financial viability by concluding that the component\u2019s financial internal rate of return \n(9.1%) exceeded the weighted average cost of capital (1.85%). Heating tariffs currently account \nfor about 2.2%\u20133.8% of an average household\u2019s income and for about 1.7%\u20133.9% of a poor \nhousehold\u2019s income (post-subsidy),13 which is considered acceptable in view of better services \nand  related  health  benefits.14 Moreover,  affordability  is  expected  to  improve  as  household \nincomes increase while medium-term heating tariff levels are held constant. A sensitivity and \nrisk analysis revealed that the component\u2019s financial internal rate of return is most sensitive to \nchanges  in  revenues  (mainly  tariffs)  and  operating  costs  (predominantly  hot  water  offtake \ncharges, which will comprise about 76% of operating costs). Hence, maintaining tariff levels and \ncontrolling offtake costs will be crucial in ensuring the component\u2019s financial viability. A financial \nanalysis of THC evaluated existing tariff and cost-recovery arrangements and concluded that \nfull-cost recovery is unrealistic in the short term, without ongoing TMG subsidies. However, the \nproject will help transform THC\u2019s cost structure, enabling the company to achieve financial self-\nsustainability in the medium term. The Tianshui Urban Construction & Investment Group will \ncontribute counterpart funding, service loans, and shoulder operation and maintenance costs for \nthe nonrevenue-generating components. A fiscal analysis revealed that, although TMG\u2019s debt \nlevel has increased in the past 5 years in line with economic development, it remains relatively \nlow at less than 20% of total annual fiscal expenditures. The analysis also indicated that TMG\u2019s \ncontributions to the project will not exceed 4.0% of annual expenditures, with total estimated \ncontribution of 1.6% of total fiscal expenditures over the project construction period (2011\u2013\n2015).  Therefore,  the  nonrevenue-generating  components  are  considered  financially \nsustainable and affordable. A financial management assessment concluded that, while TPMO, \nTianshui Urban Construction & Investment Group, and THC have strong financial management \ncapacity  and  large  project  management  experience,  they  are  relatively  inexperienced  in \nmanaging ADB projects. Hence, the capacity development component will provide ongoing \nsupport and training on ADB policies and procedures during project implementation. \n \nC.  Governance \n20.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the TMG, TPMO, implementing agencies, and their project implementing units. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM, including providing \nsupport and training on ADB policies and procedures, engaging a tendering agent to strengthen \nprocurement, and involving the Tianshui Discipline Investigation Bureau in procurement. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n21.  Poverty  and  social  benefits.  A  poverty  and  social  assessment  that  included  a \nhousehold survey, community and focus group discussions, and key informant interviews was \nconducted during project preparation. Gansu is one of the PRC\u2019s poorest and least-developed \nwestern provinces and has been prioritized in national development plans. The project will \ndirectly benefit over 640,000 urban residents, of whom approximately 13.5% are poor, and \nabout 30,000 rural residents in three towns surrounding the city\u2019s urban areas by improving \nliving conditions, public health standards, and Tianshui\u2019s urban environment. The project will \ncreate 1,466 full-time jobs during the construction stage and 658 follow-on, multiplier-effect jobs. \n                                                \n13 Minimum living guarantee system recipients (low-income households) are eligible for a CNY250 annual heating \nsubsidy, which is paid by the Tianshui municipal and Qinzhou district governments. Presubsidy heating tariffs \naccount for about 3.2%\u20135.4% of a poor household\u2019s income. \n14 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \nEmployment  targets  for  vulnerable  groups  and  women  are  included  in  the  design  and \nmonitoring  framework  and  loan  assurances.  Air  quality  and  traffic  improvements  through \nprovision of district heating services, development of the urban road network and improvements \nin NMT, and road safety and transport planning will enhance public health and safety. Improving \nthe urban road and bridge network will boost public access and mobility and reduce time \nburdens. A social development action plan and a gender action plan (GAP) have been prepared \nand will be implemented by TPMO and implementing agencies during project construction. The \nheating component will improve air quality and district heating access, but the closure of 199 \nsmall  heating  boilers  will  also  result  in  323 formal  workers  losing their  positions  and  439 \nseasonal positions being lost. A labor reemployment plan for these workers has been prepared \nthrough extensive consultation. It is supported by a loan assurance and will be implemented by \nTPMO and the implementing agencies.15 \n \n22.  Gender benefits. The project has been designed for classification as effective gender \nmainstreaming, and a GAP has been prepared and agreed. Analysis of the survey and focus \ngroup discussion data reveal that women are disproportionately affected by air pollution from \ninefficient boilers and use of home-heating stoves, and the time burden of caring for family \nmembers suffering from respiratory illnesses. Women are also largely responsible for paying \nutility bills and managing the impact of increased costs on household budgets. Improvements to \nthe urban transport network and attention to the needs of women in the planning of public \ntransport, pedestrian, NMT access, and road safety programs will also provide positive benefits \nby  reducing  time  burdens  and  increasing  access,  mobility,  and  safety.  The  GAP  includes \nspecific targets for women in employment, participation, and capacity-building opportunities, and \nis supported by a loan assurance and consultant support for implementation and monitoring. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n23.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  environment  category  A.  The  project \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) has been circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and \nwas posted on the ADB website on 20 December 2010. It concludes that the project has \nsubstantial  environmental  and  socioeconomic  benefits,  and  that  its  potential  environmental \nimpacts can be mitigated through the implementation of the environmental management plan \n(EMP) for the project. The completed domestic EIAs (in Chinese), based on extensive public \nconsultations, comply with ADB\u2019s policies and requirements, including ADB's Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). The methods and standards applied in the preparation of domestic EIAs for \nthe project components are in accordance with the guidelines of the Ministry of Environmental \nProtection,  and  also  meet  national  and  provincial  laws  and  regulations.  Although  adverse \nenvironmental impacts are anticipated during the construction and operation of the project\u2014\npotential soil erosion, geological hazards, health and safety concerns caused by asbestos if no \nproper protection measures are taken, and increased traffic noise\u2014mitigation measures and the \nproject  EMP  are  expected  to  lessen  these  potential  impacts.  During  construction,  special \nattention will be paid to soil erosion protection, protection of surface water quality, occupational \nand community health and safety, and adequate disposal of de-construction waste. During \noperation, special attention will be paid to traffic noise, geological hazards such as mud- and \nlandslides, and risks of spills during transportation of hazardous and toxic goods on project \nroads and bridges. The project\u2019s district heating component will significantly contribute to energy \nsaving and GHG emission reductions, as well as improving residents\u2019 living conditions and the \nlocal environment; the urban transport component will help the city establish an efficient, safe, \nand sustainable urban transport system that includes facilities for public transport, pedestrian \n                                                \n15 The resettlement plan for the Qinzhou district heating network component includes the labor reemployment plan. \n ", "9 \ncrossings, traffic management, and landscaping, which will benefit the local economy and local \nresidents, and will contribute to vehicle emission reduction; and the flood control component will \npromote the river embankment to the 100-year flood protection standard so that the entire urban \narea will be adequately protected from flooding. The Tianshui Environmental Protection Bureau \nwill support the executing agency and the implementing agencies in implementing the project \nEMP. Capacity building in environmental management will be provided for the executing agency \nand  the  implementing  agencies.  The  executing  agency  disclosed  relevant  environment \ninformation to the affected people through consultations during April\u2013October 2010, and the \nresults and findings were used to modify the domestic EIAs and the project design. \n \n24.  Resettlement. The project is classified as resettlement category A, since construction of \nthe project\u2019s subcomponents will necessitate significant land acquisition and resettlement. In \ntotal, the project will affect 17 village committees or community committees, 2 towns, 2 street \noffices, and 2 districts of Tianshui City.16 A total of 1,041.32 mu17 of land will be permanently \nacquired and 170 mu of land will be temporarily occupied during project implementation. The \nmain land loss relates to construction of the Chengji road and flood control facilities. Land \nacquisition will affect 1,225 households and 5,593 persons. A total of 66,249 m2 of houses and \nbuildings will be demolished, adversely impacting 416 households, 1,567 persons, and 70 small \nenterprises or institutions. These affected persons will benefit from the project through, for \ninstance, improved air quality and transport access. The TPMO and the two implementing \nagencies  will  assume  the  overall  responsibility  of  planning,  implementation,  financing,  and \nreporting on land acquisition and resettlement activities. Two resettlement plans have been \nprepared for  the  project,  have  been  endorsed  by  the  executing  agency  and  implementing \nagencies, and have been disclosed to affected people in local languages. The resettlement \nplans will be updated based on the final design and detailed measurement survey, disclosed to \naffected  persons  in  local  language  and submitted to  ADB for review  and  approval  before \nawarding civil works contracts. A grievance procedure has been established for the affected \npersons. The TPMO will submit an internal monitoring report semiannually to ADB  on the \nprogress of resettlement implementation. The TPMO will also employ an external monitoring \ninstitute or firm that will submit semiannual monitoring reports to ADB during resettlement \nimplementation, and annually for 2 years after resettlement completion. \n \n25.  Indigenous peoples. The project is classified as indigenous peoples category C, as the \nproject areas have low numbers of ethnic minority residents (1.58% of the population) who are \nintegrated economically and socially into the broader society. No adverse impacts from actions \nsuch as resettlement or land acquisition, particularly on ethnic minorities, were identified. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n26.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.18 The project has no unusual technical risks. \nThe project\u2019s integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh costs and risks. \n \n \n                                                \n16 ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) trigger for involuntary resettlement changed the terminology of \"affected \npersons\" to \"displaced persons\", which is defined as persons who are physically and/or economically displaced as \na result of involuntary acquisition of land or involuntary restrictions on land use or on access to legally designated \nparks and protected areas. In the PRC, although the resettlement plans maintain the original terminology of \n\"affected persons\u201d, the definition is equivalent to ADB's definition of \"displaced persons\u201d. \n17 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 m2).  \n18 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nHot water is not available to  (i) ADB will closely monitor CHP preparations through regular \nthe newly developed district  communications and review missions. \nheating network because  (ii) Funds for the district heating component will not be disbursed until \nCHP construction is either not  the CHP and transmission pipelines have been approved. \napproved or is delayed.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n27.  The government and TMG have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants \nfor the project, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n28.  Disbursement of loan proceeds for output 1 will be conditional on (i) approval of the CHP \npreapproval application, (ii) provision to ADB of the approved feasibility study reports and EIAs \nfor the CHP and transmission pipelines, and (iii) TMG engaging a licensed institute to conduct \nan asbestos risk assessment for all small boilers affected by the project. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n29.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$100,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Gansu Tianshui Urban Infrastructure \nDevelopment Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n7 June 2011 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and   \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact       \nBetter living  By 2020 (baseline year 2009)    Assumption \nconditions in  in Tianshui municipality    GTEZ develops effectively and \n \nTianshui  Average annual per capita  Statistics published  accelerates Gansu province's \nmunicipality  disposable income of urban  annually by the Tianshui  socioeconomic gains under the \nhouseholds increases by 6% per  Statistics Office  Twelfth Five-Year Plan. \nannum from CNY9,932.     \n   \n \nAverage of 20% reduction in air  Annual environmental  Risk \npollutants SO , NOx, and PM   monitoring report of the  Development pressures exceed \n2 10\nfrom 0.068, 0.039 and 0.082  Tianshui EPB  planned infrastructure \nmg/m3 during heating seasons  developments. \nOutcome  By 2016 (baseline year 2009)     \nImproved  in Tianshui municipality    Assumptions \n \nheating,  Heating-related carbon dioxide  Annual environmental  Government commitment and \ntransport, and  emissions reduced from  monitoring report of the  support for infrastructure \nflood control  1,082,200 to 654,400 tons per  Tianshui EPB  development continues. \nservices in  annum     \nTianshui      Project facilities are properly \nAnnual probability of seasonal  PCC issued by the \noperated and maintained. \nmunicipality \nflooding along Chengji flood  Tianshui HURCC   \n \nembankment reduced from 10%    Risks \nto 1%    Actual economic growth and \n \n  population increases are far \nDefined point-to-point traveling  PCC issued by the \nfrom estimates. \ndistances are reduced by 82%  Tianshui HURCC  \nfrom 17.8 km to 3.2 km.a      \nActual heating demands are far \n   \n1,466 jobs during project  PCC issued by the  from estimates.  \nimplementation and 658 jobs  Tianshui HURCC   \nCosts are much higher than \nduring operation are created, \nforeseen. \nwith 30% targeted for women, \nand 15% for the poor. \nOutputs  By 2016 (baseline year 2009)     \n1.
