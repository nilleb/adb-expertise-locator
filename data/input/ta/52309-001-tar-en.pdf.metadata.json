INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support efforts of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  develop  human  capital  to  advance  and share  knowledge for \ninnovation and technology adoption and diffusion in its developing member countries (DMCs).1 \nAligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, the TA emphasizes promoting the use of innovative technology, \nstrengthening knowledge services, and using a country-focused approach to accelerate and \nsustain economic development in the DMCs by addressing the increasingly complex development \nchallenges facing Asia and the Pacific.2 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the 2019 and 2020 management-approved results-based work plan \nof the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department. It is in line with the President\u2019s \nPlanning Directions for 2019 to deliver quality operations by incorporating new approaches, \nknowledge  creation  and  exchange  with  clients,  advanced  technologies,  collaboration,  and \ninnovation.3 This TA is anchored in and will support the implementation of the Korea-Asia and \nPacific Tech Corp (KTC) Program, which underlines the cooperation agreement ADB signed in \nMay 2018 with the Ministry of Strategy and Finance of the Republic of Korea.4 The KTC Program \nwill engage experts from Asia and the Pacific, including the Republic of Korea, to help build \ncapacity in ADB\u2019s DMCs to learn new skills and adopt innovation. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Developing countries have experienced slower efficiency gains and technology absorption \nthat could undermine their progress on the Sustainable Development Goals.5 A 2014 ADB study \nindicated that developing economies in Asia significantly lag behind advanced nations on the four \nknowledge economy pillars: innovation, education and skills, information and communications \ntechnology, and the economic incentive and institutional regime.6 This has affected their ability to \nmaximize technological breakthroughs because of (i) high costs in tapping innovation, (ii) the \nconcentration of technology and innovation among a few firms in select sectors and countries, (iii) \nreliance on external expertise because of the lack of local technical and skilled resources, and (iv) \nconstraints in attracting affordable and skilled partners to customize the technologies. The \ngovernment\u2019s role in providing an enabling environment to use better technology, spur innovation, \nand build human capital is key to helping DMCs achieve and sustain long-term economic growth.7 \n \n4.  ADB can offer these DMCs the opportunity to leverage the right technologies and develop \ntheir absorptive capacity by (i) improving human capital formation, i.e., innovation capacity, with \nfinancial, institutional, and governing mechanisms; and (ii) attracting skilled and experienced \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 November 2019. \n2  ADB. 2018.

This TA focuses on providing capacity to DMCs on innovation and technology through \nknowledge immersion. The TA defines \u201cinnovation\u201d as change that adds value to DMC clients, \n\u201cadvanced technology\u201d as systems and processes that adopt to and reflect the latest trends in \naddressing development challenges, and \u201cknowledge immersion\u201d as an approach for learning in \nwhich embedded experts work with clients over a sustained period to create and transfer \nknowledge, customize knowledge to local needs, and build local capacity. Knowledge immersion \ncan occur through  \n(i)   consulting  focused  on  transferring  knowledge  through  personalization,  e.g., \ninteraction, and codification, e.g., documents, repositories, and databases; and  \n(ii)   knowledge absorption through instruction, e.g., deductive and programmed, and \nexploration, e.g., trial and error and high learner control.  \nThe potential for knowledge immersion is greatest for DMCs in South Asia and Southeast Asia \nbecause they require support to convert to a knowledge-based economy through innovation \n(footnote 7). For instance, India and Indonesia have low technological readiness even after \nseveral programs focused on innovations, suggesting that the benefits of innovative activities are \nnot shared with peers.10 Middle-income countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia have high \ndemand for knowledge-intensive operations from ADB.11 For example, Teach for Philippines, a \nlocal  nongovernment  organization  that  works  with  the  government  to  recruit  teachers  and \nmodernize teaching techniques, is seeking an expert to develop an end-to-end data management \nand client relationship portal. \n \n6.  Through knowledge immersion, DMCs can learn from developed countries\u2019 experience in \nachieving high-income status through systematic knowledge-based economic development. The \nRepublic  of  Korea  has  supported  ADB  DMCs  through  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and \nKnowledge Partnership Fund since 2006. The fund financed knowledge sharing in ADB projects \nsuch as Myanmar\u2019s e-Government master plan, Bangladesh\u2019s information technology parks for \nemployment and innovation, and the Asia Leadership Program regional knowledge sharing \nthrough communities of leaders. The program demonstrated that active learning through field \nvisits and simulation exercises is far more effective than passive learning through keynote \nspeeches and panel presentations.12 \n \n7.  Strongly aligned with the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund \nobjectives, the TA proposes to access this fund to (i) mobilize experts to support identified \ndevelopment needs in DMCs and associated projects and (ii) capture and share emerging best \npractices and lessons to help scale up and replicate innovation. Knowledge immersion will help \nbuild the necessary local human capital skills and facilitate knowledge sharing to develop long-\nterm local capacity in DMCs, initially targeted for South Asia and Southeast Asia DMCs. \n \n8  A.

The TA is aligned with the following impact: use of innovative technologies in DMCs \npromoted  (footnote  2).  The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome:  DMCs\u2019  capacity  to  adopt \ninnovation and technology advancements in development priorities enhanced.13 The outcome will \nbe achieved through the following outputs. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output  1:  Knowledge  immersion  in  developing  member  countries  supported. \nKnowledge immersion involves (i) matching knowledge gaps with appropriate expertise, and (ii) \ndeploying expertise to DMCs to help with long-term knowledge creation and transfer. The TA will \nidentify specific knowledge gaps in consultation with the operations departments, the resident \nmissions, and the sector and thematic groups. ADB will engage experts for at least 1 year initially \nwith the KTC Program, based on specific DMC needs. Like the embedded technical advisors\u2019 \nprogram14 of the Global Green Growth Institute and the United Nations Volunteers Program,15 the \nTA will adopt a formal onboarding process to familiarize experts with the DMCs by working \nalongside national consultants and project staff. Offboarding will require experts to document their \nwork to retain knowledge and help build the capacity of DMC officials. The TA defines offboarding \nas an exit management process for the experts which include capture and sharing of their tacit \nknowledge. Potential sectors where experts will be fielded are education (Teach for Philippines), \ninformation and communications technology, and transport. \n \n10.  Output  2:  Replicable  practices  and  lessons  disseminated.  The  TA  will  capture \nexperiences gained from knowledge immersion and emerging best practices and share them \nthrough various media, including blogs, videos, and case studies. This information will also be \nhoused  in  and  disseminated  through  appropriate  platforms,  such  as  workshops.  This \ndissemination will help build evidence on knowledge immersion\u2019s success and draw interest from \nother countries that are willing to share their innovation and technology and provide resources to \nbuild capacity in the DMCs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nRepublic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB, through the Knowledge Advisory Services Center (SDCC-KC) of the Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department, will administer the TA and will be the executing \nagency. SDCC-KC will implement the TA in close coordination with the operations departments, \nresident missions, and sector and thematic groups to identify (i) innovation and technology gaps \nin DMCs and (ii) the appropriate expertise to support TA implementation. SDCC-KC will draft \n \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n14 Global Green Growth Institute Partners. https://gggi.org/partners/  \n15 United Nations Volunteers. https://www.unv.org/ \n ", "4 \ndetailed terms of reference with the counterpart agency from the DMC. SDCC-KC will develop a \nreporting  mechanism  and  templates  (including  an  evaluation  form  for  outputs)  to  ensure \ncomprehensive  support  for  DMCs  in  adopting,  implementing,  and  diffusing  innovation. \nParticipating DMCs will be asked to provide their no objection before the implementation of any \nactivity financed by the TA. \n \n13.
