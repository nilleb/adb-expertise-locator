THE PROPOSAL \n \n  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People's Republic of China (PRC) for the additional financing of the Heilongjiang Green Urban \nand Economic Revitalization Project.  \n \n  The overall project remains timely and essential for providing strategic and comprehensive \nsupport to multicity non-coal diversification. It aims to revitalize the economy and improve urban \nlivability through (i) a financial intermediation component (FIC), linked to a business development \nservices (BDS) subcomponent, to strengthen the capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs) and enable private sector development; and (ii) investment project components that \nenhance regional public goods by cleaning up the environment from coal-mining impacts, reduce \npollution, and improve urban infrastructure and public services for people in the coal-dependent \ncities of Hegang, Jixi, Qitaihe, and Shuangyashan (project cities) in eastern Heilongjiang Province \nin northeastern PRC.1 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance to \nprepare the project.2 The government requested additional financing to help fund outputs 3, 4, \nand 5 (paras. 14\u201316), to cover the gap left when originally planned cofinancing did not materialize. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n  The project cities were important bases for coal mining and electricity production in the \nPRC, particularly between 1949 and 2013.3 Their fundamental reliance on coal mining and related \nindustries made their economies vulnerable, especially when coal prices dropped steeply in 2013. \nChanging global and domestic energy and climate change policies also contributed to rapid \neconomic decline, wage reductions, unemployment, urban poverty, and population loss in the \nproject cities.4 In 2014, the project cities had an average per capita gross domestic product of \nCNY26,600, 33% lower than the average rate in Heilongjiang Province, which in turn was about \n16% below the national average.  \n \n  The project cities suffer from environmental degradation (pollution of soil, water, and air) \ncaused by more than 60 years of coal mining. This, along with inadequate urban infrastructure \nand  services\u2014e.g.,  water  supply,  wastewater  management,  drainage,  and  district  heating \nsystems\u2014makes  for  poor  livability.  Project  cities  lack  adequate  road  maintenance,  public \ntransport, bus lanes, bus stops, and sidewalks; and urgently need road rehabilitation. Some rivers, \nespecially in Hegang and Jixi, flood during heavy storms, have narrow channels, and are polluted \nby sediments and untreated discharge of domestic and industrial wastewater.  \n \n  Value added by ADB assistance. ADB helped identify and comprehensively tackle key \neconomic development challenges through non-coal diversification, sustainable and inclusive \nprivate sector development, and job creation. It enabled a holistic investment project that will \ngenerate cross-sector synergies. It prepared a diversification road map and an SME development \nand  financing  program  to  leverage  ADB  funds  and  strengthen  the  local  finance  sector.  It \ncontributes  to  regional  public  goods  by  preparing  initial  mining  remediation  strategies  and \n                                                \n1  ADB has engaged in policy dialogue and provided project support for urban environmental improvement and water \npollution prevention for more than 20 years in Heilongjiang Province. \n2  ADB.  2015.

ADB assessed the climate risk and \nproposed adaptation measures that are included in the overall project.  \n \n  Strategic fit. The project builds on more than 20 years of partnership between ADB and \nHeilongjiang Province, including several strategic priority projects such as reducing pollution and \nflood risk in the Songhua River Basin with both public and private sector support.5 It supports \ngovernment  strategies  to  revitalize  the  PRC\u2019s  challenged  northeastern  region.  Through  its \nstrategic  and  holistic  approach,  the  project  will  support  the  (i)  13th  five-year  plans  of  the \ngovernments of the PRC, Heilongjiang Province, and project cities to transform the economy and \nimprove financing of new industries and SMEs;6 (ii) Transformation Development Planning of \nCoal Cities in Heilongjiang Province, 2014\u20132020 by assisting SMEs in non-coal pillar industries \nsuch as green food processing, graphite high-tech materials and products, machinery, tourism, \ntrade,  and  logistics;  and  (iii)  the  National  New-Type  Urbanization  Plan,  2014\u20132020  by \nstrengthening small and medium-sized cities.7 The project aligns with ADB policies, notably the \n(i) Strategy 2030 and its operational priority of livable cities by (a) providing integrated solutions \nto four cities to show their transformation from coal-based to diverse, green, and livable cities;   \n(b) enhancing resilience to climate change shocks and stresses, e.g., reducing flood risk and \nincreasing water safety; (c) strengthening institutions by building institutional knowledge and \ncapacity; and (d) sharing best practices and innovation experiences both for replication in the \nPRC and for cooperation among developing member countries;8 (ii) country partnership strategy, \n2016\u20132020  for  the  PRC  by  supporting  socially  inclusive,  environmentally  sustainable,  and \neconomically  competitive  urban  development; 9  and  (iii)  various  operational  plans  and \nenvironment operational directions.10 \n \n  The  current  project  was  approved  on  5  December  2017  and  declared  effective  on                  \n4 September 2018. It is performing well and meets all criteria to be eligible for additional financing \nbecause (i) it is rated on track under the project performance system; (ii) each safeguard covenant \nis being complied with; (iii) the delivery of expected outputs is rated successful given that the initial \nactions\u2014such as advanced contracting and retroactive financing,11 disbursement of an initial \nadvance of $20 million to the advance account, subsequent liquidation and replenishment of \n$9.63 million, and the preparation of the detailed engineering design and bidding documents\u2014\nare progressing as planned; and (iv) the management of risks is rated successful since all the \nrisks in the Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan were managed successfully. By June \n2019, with 27.30% of the project time elapsed, physical progress stood at about 19.00%, and loan \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2008.

Eight \ncontracts totaling $22.88 million have been awarded. \n  \n  The government requested ADB to provide additional financing to cover the financing gap \nthat emerged when originally planned cofinancing by the European Investment Bank (EIB) did \nnot materialize despite EIB\u2019s earlier indication of interest. The proposed additional financing was \nincluded as a 2019 firm project for $150 million (\u20ac133.929 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources in the country operations business plan for the PRC, 2019\u20132021 to help finance \noutputs 3, 4, and 5. The project remains consistent with the country partnership strategy (footnote \n9), and additional financing is essential to fully deliver the outputs and outcome. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) economy revitalized and diversified, \nand non-coal industries in the cities of Hegang, Jixi, Qitaihe, and Shuangyashan developed \n(footnote 6); and (ii) living environment, safety, and public health in the cities of Hegang, Jixi, \nQitaihe, and Shuangyashan improved (footnote 7). The project will have the following outcome: \nnon-coal economic activities and urban livability in project cities increased.12 The impact and \noutcome of the overall project will remain unchanged from the current project. \n \n  The comprehensive revitalization approach of the overall project is expected to help stop \nthe out-migration of young and qualified workers, draw new individuals and companies to the \nnewly attractive project cities, and retain existing residents. The project will directly benefit         \n2.73  million  urban  residents  through  (i) stronger  SME  competitiveness  and  job  creation  in \nimproved non-coal industrial parks; (ii) a positive environment and public image through mining \nremediation; (iii) better water supply, sewers, district heating, flood protection, roads, road safety, \nand public transport; (iv) greater environmental and traffic safety awareness through public \neducation programs; and (v) closer cooperation between project cities in tourism promotion, \nlogistics and trade, supply chain integration, and SME support using smart city applications. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n  The overall project outputs will remain unchanged from the current project. Details are in \nthe design and monitoring framework, in the project administration manuals (PAMs), and in the \nprocurement plan.13 \n \n   Output 1: Capacity for business development services and integrated project \nplanning and management developed. The project will support project management and \ncapacity development to ensure successful diversification and project sustainability in the areas \nof (i) project planning, procurement, and financial management; (ii) BDS for SMEs and local SME \nbureaus;  (iii) human  resources  and  skills  development;  (iv) smart  city  cluster  cooperation;             \n(v) planning and implementation of mining remediation; (vi) flood risk management, climate \nresilience,  and  sponge  city  planning;  (vii) design,  construction,  and  operation  of  water, \nwastewater, and drainage systems; and (viii) sustainable urban public transport and road safety. \n \n  Output  2:  Sustainable  investment  in  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and \naccess to finance in project cities improved. The project will establish an SME financing \n                                                \n12  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n13 Project Administration Manual: Investment Project Components (Section A) [PAM (Section A)], and Project \nAdministration Manual: Financial Intermediation Component and Business Development Services Subcomponent \n(Section B) [PAM (Section B)] (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \nplatform, using the FIC, to mobilize domestic financing. The platform will offer (i) cofinancing loans \nfor SMEs by financial intermediaries in which the ADB loan component is subordinated, (ii) a first-\nloss cash collateral facility to mobilize commercial guarantees and ease access to commercial \nfinancing for investments and longer-term working capital, and (iii) entrusted loans for high-priority \nprojects for local governments. The FIC will be linked to the BDS subcomponent (output 1). \n \n  Output 3: Key infrastructure and facilities for small and medium-sized enterprises \nin  non-coal  industrial  parks  in  project  cities  constructed.  The  additional  financing  will \naugment the current loan to help build and make operational key infrastructure and facilities, \nincluding  (i) roads  with  advanced  safety features  and  associated  utility  pipes;  (ii) industrial \nwastewater treatment plants (WWTPs); and (iii) facilities for SMEs, start-ups, and for training. \n \n  Output 4: Remediation and environmental cleanup from mining impacts in project \ncities improved. The additional financing will augment the current loan to help develop mining \nremediation strategies, prepare investment plans, and implement pilot projects as models for \nreplication. In Hegang, remediation of an open-pit mine will involve grading, clay lining, topsoil \ncover, vegetation, environmental management, and monitoring. In Jixi, a former mining area and \nwaste-rock  dumpsite,  and  initiate  construction  and  operation  of  a  subsidence-monitoring \ncenter. In Qitaihe  and  Shuangyashan,  waste-rock  dumpsites  and  subsidence  areas  will  be \nremediated and reused as open spaces. \n \n  Output 5: Integrated urban infrastructure and services in project cities improved. \nThe additional financing will augment the current loan to help enhance urban livability and \nattractiveness through improved, spatially integrated infrastructure and services: (i) Hegang\u2014\nriver rehabilitation, drainage system, sustainable urban and public transport, urban greening, and \ndistrict heating; (ii) Jixi\u2014integrated improvements to the core area of Hengshan District and West \nJixi, including river rehabilitation, urban roads, water supply, wastewater management, and \ndrainage  system;  (iii)  Qitaihe\u2014water  supply,  wastewater,  and  public  transport  systems \nimprovements; and (iv) Shuangyashan\u2014sustainable urban transport through key road links, \nwater supply, sewer, and drainage systems. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n  The overall project is estimated to cost $1,011.0 million equivalent (Table 1). The amount \nwas reduced from $1,021.0 million after an update of foreign exchange rates and because the \ninterest cost will be lower if the total loan amount is lower. Detailed cost estimates by expenditure \ncategory and by financier are included in the PAM (Section A). The major expenditure items for \nthe overall project are civil works, procurement and installation of equipment, FIC costs, and \nconsulting services. Additional financing will help finance outputs 3, 4, and 5. \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \nAdditional  Overall \nCurrent  Additional  Financing  Projectb \nAmounta  Financing  ($ million  ($ million \nItem  ($ million)  (\u20ac million)   equivalent)  equivalent) \nA.

Table 2, footnote b of the approved report \nand recommendation of the President indicates that cofinancing is subject to EIB approval. The allocation and \nwithdrawal of loan proceeds items of the current project in the project administration manual (Tables 15a and 15b) \nwere revised to reflect reallocation between cost categories, removing amounts from the ADB\u2013EIB joint cost category. \ne  The government counterpart amount for each city was recalculated, and increased in accordance with the shares in \nthe reduced total loan amount: (ia) Hegang\u2014$96.04 million equivalent; (iia) Jixi\u2014$71.69 million equivalent; \n(iiia) Qitaihe\u2014$118.00 million equivalent; and (iva) Shuangyashan\u2014$89.29 million equivalent. \nf   Cofinancing and subborrower counterpart contributions are estimated based on a 70:30 debt\u2013equity structure and \nagreed cofinancing ratios with the financial intermediaries for the three financial products. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  The  implementation  arrangements  remain  unchanged.  The  Heilongjiang  Provincial \nGovernment (HPG) is the executing agency and continues to supervise, coordinate, and manage \nthe project. The Heilongjiang Finance Department opened an advance account for the current \nproject, and will establish and maintain a second account in the form of a subledger for the \nadditional financing. The government requested an initial advance of $20 million for the current \nproject in 2018 and will continue to manage the advance account\u2014and now also the subledger\u2014\nand to support financial management. The municipal governments of Hegang, Jixi, Qitaihe, and \nShuangyashan are the implementing agencies, and each established and operates (i) a project \nleading group headed by the mayor or vice mayor, (ii) a local project management office (PMO) \nunder the municipal development and reform commission, and (iii) project implementation units \n(PIUs) in the participating agencies to implement the subcomponents.  \n \n  The updated implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in \ndetail in the PAM (Section A).14 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  March 2018 (current project) / March 2020 (additional financing)\u2013February 2023 \nEstimated completion date  28 February 2023 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 August 2023 \n   \n                                                \n14 PAM (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nAspects  Arrangements \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Heilongjiang PLG  \n(ii)  Executing agency  HPG, under HDRC\u2019s leadership and with HAD, HFD, and HIITC participation \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  HMG, JMG, QMG, and SMG, each with a local PLG and PMO \n(iv)  Implementation units  Project cities\u2019 concerned departments \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  5 contracts  $51.94 million \nNational competitive bidding  47 contracts  $419.21 million \nConsulting services  QCBS (2 contracts)  845 person-months  $12.91 million \nCQS (5 contracts)  148 person-months  $1.18 million \nICS (6 contracts)  16 person-months  $0.17 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  A goods contract for Hegang\u2019s intelligent transport system ($1.41 million) and a \nadvance contracting  civil works contract for Shuangyashan\u2019s Xinxing Avenue link ($21.40 million) were \nimplemented as advance contracting and retroactive financing for the current \nproject. Consulting services were also considered as advance procurement of the \ncurrent project. Retroactive financing will be provided for eligible expenses \nincurred not more than 12 months prior to date of the loan agreement. Total \nretroactive financing will not exceed 20% of the loan amount. \nDisbursement  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB, as per the PAM. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CQS = consultants\u2019 qualifications selection, HAD = Heilongjiang Audit Department, \nHDRC = Heilongjiang Development and Reform Commission, HFD = Heilongjiang Finance Department, HIITC = \nHeilongjiang Industrial and Information Technology Commission, HMG = Hegang Municipal Government, HPG = \nHeilongjiang Provincial Government, ICS = individual consultants selection, JMG = Jixi Municipal Government, PAM = \nproject administration manual, PLG = project leading group, PMO = project management office, QCBS = quality- and \ncost-based selection, QMG = Qitaihe Municipal Government, SMG = Shuangyashan Municipal Government. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n  The current project and the proposed additional financing remain technically feasible and \ncomply with PRC and international engineering standards, local regulations and conditions, and \nstrategic and sector priorities. Design options were compared, and the best possible technologies \nwith the least environmental, social, and cost impacts were selected. The proposed capacity \ndevelopment aims at the successful implementation and sustainable operation of the project.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n  Economic  analysis.  The  original  economic  analysis  for  all  investment  loan \nsubcomponents, prepared following ADB guidelines, was updated.15 The economic viability of the \noverall project was reconfirmed under various sensitivity scenarios. Benefits considered include \n(i) improved water supply, wastewater management, and sanitation; (ii) improved flood protection \nand avoided damage; (iii) increased savings in vehicle operating costs and travel time; and \n(iv) improved public health with less productivity losses and reduced medical costs. Additional \nbenefits include more SME employment, reduced carbon emission through mining remediation, \nincreased  carbon  sequestration  from  afforestation,  and  less  exposure  to  pathogens.  The \neconomic internal rate of return was recalculated at 15.4% (above the 9.0% economic opportunity \ncost of capital); it drops to 14.3% if the capital cost increases by 10.0%, to 15.3% if the operating \ncost increases by 10.0%, to 14.0% under a 10.0% benefit decrease, to 12.8% when combining \nthese assumptions, and to 15.2% if benefits are achieved with a 1-year delay. \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila; ADB. 1998. Guidelines for the Economic \nAnalysis of Water Supply Projects. Manila. \n ", "8 \n   Financial analysis. The original financial analysis carried out for all revenue-generating \nsubcomponents was updated to reflect the change of financier and loan terms, a lower loan \namount and lower total interest and financing charges, and foreign exchange rate fluctuation. \nMost assumptions and costs are unchanged, and the project remains financially feasible. The \nfinancial internal rate of return was recalculated in real terms at 2.96% for the Hegang Luobei \nWWTP, 3.43% for Hegang\u2019s district heating, 2.67% for the Jixi WWTP, 7.44% for Jixi\u2019s water \nsupply, and 3.45% for Qitaihe\u2019s water supply. These rates exceed the weighted average costs of \ncapital of 0.86% for the Hegang WWTP, 2.01% for Hegang\u2019s district heating, 1.50% for the Jixi \nWWTP, 1.17% for Jixi\u2019s water supply, and 2.16% for Qitaihe\u2019s water supply. The rates remain \nrobust under various sensitivity scenarios. Fiscal analysis concluded that the project cities are \nlikely  to  require  support  from  the  provincial  government  to  meet  shortfalls  in  counterpart \ncontributions, as well as for debt servicing and operation and maintenance of project facilities. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n  The financial management risk for the overall project is still moderate because the PMOs \nand PIUs have limited experience with ADB-financed projects. This risk will be mitigated through \nproject implementation support as described in the risk management plan and summarized in \nTable 4. ADB and consultants provided training on safeguard implementation, procurement, and \ndisbursement. A financial management action plan is provided in the PAM (Section A). \n \n   The procurement risk for the overall project remains moderate. Given its experience with \nADB projects, HPG will supervise the less experienced PIUs. The procurement arrangement is \ndeemed adequate, since a tendering agency and consultants under output 1 will provide support \nduring  implementation.  Procurement  under  the  additional  financing  will  also  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  as  per  the  current  loan \narrangement. \n \n  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith HPG and the governments of Hegang, Jixi, Qitaihe, and Shuangyashan. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (Section A, footnote 14). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n  The overall project will contribute to poverty reduction by supporting SME development \nand job creation, and by improving infrastructure and services, public health, sanitation, and living \nconditions. The project will create 1,853 skilled and 5,430 unskilled jobs during construction, and \n398 skilled and 138 unskilled jobs during operation. The PMOs will prioritize vulnerable groups, \nsuch as women and the poor, for employment and training. A social and gender action plan was \nprepared to ensure that positive benefits of the project accrue to beneficiaries. \n \n   Gender benefits. The overall project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. \nWomen are affected by unemployment and poor urban services, and consider improvements in \nroad safety and public transport as important benefits to their well-being and quality of life. The \nsocial  and  gender  action  plan  will  improve  women\u2019s  employment  opportunities;  provide \nconsultation and participation opportunities; and proactively help prevent and respond to sexual \nharassment, exploitation, and abuse during project construction and operation. It will raise \nawareness on environmental protection, road safety, and flood risk management through public \neducation. The FIC will provide loans to SMEs and start-up companies owned and/or managed \nby women. Social development and gender specialists will support project implementation. \n \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n \n  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS,  2009),  the  safeguard \ncategories for the additional financing are C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous peoples, since it requires no change in scope, while the safeguard categories for the \noverall project are as shown in paras. 30\u201333.16 Meaningful consultations on safeguards and on \nthe grievance redress mechanism have taken place and will continue. \n  Environment (overall project: category A). An environmental impact assessment and \nenvironmental management plan\u2014prepared in compliance with the SPS, and disclosed on the \nADB website on 22 May 2017\u2014remain valid for the overall project.17 Overall, the project will \ngenerate positive impacts on the environment. Impacts during construction include earthworks \nand movement, treatment of soil, polluted river sediment, and contaminated soil from coal \nprocessing. Temporary impacts are on soil, surface water, air, and community safety, but will not \ncause loss of valuable ecology or physical cultural resources. Impacts during operation include \nan increase in traffic on project roads. The environmental management plan (EMP) includes \nmeasures to avoid and/or mitigate impacts during construction and operation, and deal with \npotential subsidence and leachate release at mining remediation sites. Site-specific EMPs were \nprepared based on the original EMP, and included in tender documents and contracts for ongoing \nand  planned  works.  Implementation  and  monitoring  are  in  compliance  with  the  SPS,  no \ngrievances  and  no  health  or  safety  incidents  were  identified  or  reported,  and  an  internal \nmonitoring report was disclosed on the ADB website. Safeguard training was provided to PMOs \nand their safeguard officers. \n \n  Involuntary resettlement (overall project: category A). Four resettlement plans were \nprepared in line with government laws and regulations on involuntary resettlement and the SPS. \nAbout 318 households (1,075 persons) will be permanently affected by impacts on collective farm \nland (908.37 mu).18 Impacts on households and annual per capita income are found to be \nmarginal with loss at no more than 10%. About 296 households (700 persons) will be affected by \nhouse  demolition  and  relocation.  About  6  organizations  (1,530  workers)  and  10  stores \n(32 persons) will be affected by impacts on structures. HPG engaged a start-up consultant to \nsupport the updating and monitoring of the resettlement plan, and is engaging an external \nmonitoring agency. The resettlement plan for Shuangyashan was updated specifically for the \nXinxing Avenue\u2013Railway Bridge component in January 2018, while the preparation of updated \nresettlement plans reflecting the detailed designs for the three other project cities is ongoing. Each \nPMO has designated resettlement staff and a functional grievance redress mechanism. The \nproject implementation consultants initiated capacity building support to PMO staff on involuntary \nresettlement. An internal monitoring report was disclosed on the ADB website. \n \n  Indigenous peoples (overall project: category C). Ethnic minorities account for less \nthan 4% of the population in project cities. Due diligence confirmed that ethnic minorities will \nbenefit equally from the project, and no negative impact on indigenous peoples will arise from the \noverall project. \n \n                                                \n16 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories \n17 The environmental impact assessment incorporates results from ADB and domestic reports, including consultant \nreports, domestic feasibility studies, domestic environmental impact assessments, and climate risk and vulnerability \nassessments. The domestic safeguard documents were prepared in compliance with the PRC Law on Environmental \nImpact Assessment (2016), the Technical Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment (HJ 2.1 -2016), and \nother PRC regulations and guidelines. \n18 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement for land area (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n ", "10 \nF.
