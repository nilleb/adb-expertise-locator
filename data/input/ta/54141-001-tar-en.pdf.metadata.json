INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Strengthening  Policy \nFormulation and Implementation will help the Government of Bhutan build its institutional capacity \nin the areas of policy formulation and implementation for effective debt management and robust \nmacroeconomic coordination, including private sector participation. \n \n2.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  two  operational  priorities  of  Strategy  2030  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB):1 (i) operational priority 1: addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities, including spatial disparities; (ii) operational priority 2: accelerating progress in gender \nequality; and (iii) operational priority 6: strengthening governance and institutional capacity \nthrough  innovative  and  sustainable  solutions  to  strengthen  the  country\u2019s  capacity  in \nmacroeconomic coordination and debt management. The TA is also included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan, 2020\u20132022.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Slowing growth. Bhutan\u2019s impressive annual average economic growth of 7.0% since \nthe late 1980s has slowed in the last 2 years (3.8% growth rate in FY2018 and 4.4% in FY2019).3 \nIn 2020, Bhutan\u2019s economy was expected to rebound from two consecutive years of lackluster \ngrowth,  but  these  prospects  were  dampened  by  the  impact  of  the  coronavirus  disease            \n(COVID-19) pandemic. ADB\u2019s lower-bound estimates for gross domestic product project growth \nto slide by 5.0 percentage points to 1% in FY2020.  The high growth until 2017 was primarily \ndriven by public sector-led hydropower development, which contributed about 25% to growth and \nwas a major source of government revenue.4 However, the capital-intensive and low-employment \nelasticity nature of the sector has not been able to drive private sector growth or employ the \nincreasing young and educated population entering the job market. Additionally, the high import \ncontent of hydropower construction has resulted in a large external imbalance and high foreign \ncurrency debt, at more than 100% of gross domestic product. To diversify away from hydropower, \nthe government intends to and has undertaken initiatives to strengthen its macroeconomic \ncoordination and improve policy and regulatory reforms for private sector development.  \n \n4.  Public sector domination. The dominance of the public sector in the economy is \nreflected  in  the  large  number  of  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  and  government-linked \ncompanies. SOEs generate about 40% of government revenues and almost half of all jobs outside \nagriculture. In contrast, the private sector remains underdeveloped and predominantly engaged \nin low-scale, low-productivity investments. This is in spite of the government introducing reforms \nand providing incentives to improve the regulatory environment for business operations. Limited \nplatforms are available to initiate policy dialogue and carry out analysis aimed at improving the \nease of doing business, in which Bhutan needs drastic improvement. Such platforms would \naccelerate private sector growth and enhance the contribution of the private sector in the country\u2019s \ndevelopment process. \n \n \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 September 2019. \n3  Government of Bhutan, National Statistics Bureau.

Although the government\u2019s effectiveness in macroeconomic \ncoordination and public financial management has improved over the years, the overall efficiency \nand effectiveness of the public sector remains low. The government does not have a sound \nmacroeconomic model to track and forecast key macroeconomic variables and an early economic \nwarning system that can ensure timely macroeconomic policies and decisions. Further, the \nvertical  and  horizontal  coordination  mechanism  between  the  central  agencies  and  local \ngovernments is weak in terms of macroeconomic forecasting and planning. Public servants have \nlimited expertise to carry  out macroeconomic forecasting, which is exacerbated by lack of \nresearch and data. Even when data are available, the government\u2019s capacity to use data to \nanalyze reform options and model distributional impacts is limited. Bhutan\u2019s declining overseas \ndevelopment  assistance  and  the  limited means  to  earn convertible  currency  indicates that \nfinancing debt service may be a challenge for the country. The government\u2019s debt management \nsystem, which is the foundation of efficient public debt management, is stand-alone and outdated. \nIt has not kept up with the changing technology and needs urgent upgrading to ensure efficient \npublic debt management. \n \n6.  Private sector lags behind. Bhutan urgently needs to refocus its policy framework to \nmeet the requirements of a country about to graduate from least developed country status, in \nwhich the private sector is expected to play an increasing role. The government will have to \nmaintain the momentum of reform efforts to enable greater private sector participation. It needs \nto  undertake  sound  analytical  work  to  study  various  policy  issues  and  options,  based  on \nexperiences from other countries, and adapt them to Bhutan\u2019s need. It also needs to create \nplatforms for private sector engagement to facilitate discourse on policy options and encourage \nstakeholder participation in policy formulation. \n  \n7.  Government strategy. The twelfth plan, 2018\u20132023 has ambitious targets for economic \ngrowth  and  job  creation,  while  minimizing  social  and  climate-related  vulnerabilities.5  The \ngovernment is undertaking reforms to strengthen domestic resource mobilization efforts, including \nthe adoption of a public financial management strategy that places priority on mobilizing domestic \nrevenue to compensate for declining external grants. It is also committed to building adequate \ncapacity for these reforms to yield results and contribute toward achieving Bhutan\u2019s development \nagenda of green sustainable and equitable socioeconomic development. This is evident from the \nTwelfth  Five  Year  Plan\u2019s  national  key  result  area  1,  which  focuses  on  strengthening \nmacroeconomic coordination, sustaining fiscal sustainability, and strengthening public financial \nmanagement. \n  \n8.  ADB experiences and lessons. In 2012, ADB supported the government with TA for \nEnhancing Development Management for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth.6 The TA supported \nthe  government  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  to  (i)  strengthen  analytical  skills  for \nmacroeconomic  management  and  project  implementation,  and  (ii)  enhance  knowledge  of \nsocioeconomic assessment and impact evaluation studies. Lessons and evaluation of the TA \ninterventions indicate the need for continued capacity strengthening in macroeconomic analysis \n(including enhancing private sector participation) and macroeconomic forecasting, fiscal planning, \nand  effective  debt  management  to  enhance  the  effectiveness,  efficiency,  and  success  of \ndevelopment projects and programs. \n \n \n \n5   Government of Bhutan, Gross National Happiness Commission. 2019.

Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  Bhutan\u2019s  macroeconomic  coordination \nstrengthened (footnote 5). The TA will have the following outcome: macroeconomic planning and \ndebt management improved.7 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Macroeconomic forecasting and debt management system strengthened. \nWhile  macroeconomic  forecasting  is  key  to  sound  economic  decisions,  long-term  fiscal \nsustainability requires adequate debt management. Under this output, the TA will support the \nMOF to enhance its capacity for macroeconomic forecasting. An initial capacity assessment of \nthe MOF will be carried out and, based on the assessment, customized trainings will be conducted \nfor MOF officials in empirical modeling and forecasting, including analytical framework and tools \nfor modeling and quantitative analysis. The current debt management system, established under \nthe Commonwealth Secretariat\u2019s Public Debt Management Programme, will be augmented and \nupgraded to a web-based relational system.8 The existing stand-alone system will be migrated to \na more robust and cloud-based system called Meridian, developed by the Commonwealth \nSecretariat\u2019s Debt Management Unit for its member countries, and will provide multiple access to \nreal-time data with options for automatic upgrades. Officials of the Department of Macroeconomic \nAffairs (DMEA) will be provided on-the-job training to operate the system. \n \n11.  Output 2: Integrated knowledge management and institutional capacity-building \nprogram in research and analysis improved. The TA will provide resources for more informed \npolicy making by establishing a knowledge base through research and analytical studies. It will \nfacilitate wider discussion of policy issues nationally, and provide the government with a forum to \nsolicit the views and insights of international experts through seminars and workshops. It will build \non the results of previous ADB TA for Enhancing Development Management for Sustainable and \nInclusive Growth (footnote 6) and will support in (i) providing assistance for policy research and \nanalysis, data collection, and information dissemination, including the assessment of SOEs, \nreview of the National Pension and Provident Fund, and sustainable tourism development; (ii) \ncreating a forum for policy dialogue and analysis to foster constructive policy dialogue between \nthe government and the private sector to enhance private sector development; and (iii) building \nthe capacity of select government agencies to improve the economic policy reform agenda by \nproviding training in evaluating policy reforms, providing feedback on policy implementation, and \nanalyzing and responding to regional and global economic challenges. The training programs will \nbe conducted both within and outside the country, based on the availability of experts and \ninstitutions. If the COVID-19 situation does not improve, trainings will be conducted through \nalternative methods using online platforms, and consultants will carry out studies using alternative \nworking arrangements. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $830,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6).
