INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen Mongolia\u2019s climate \nchange adaptation capacity and community resilience to climate change through three outputs \ndesigned to build the knowledge and capacity of the Climate Change Research and Cooperation \nCenter (CCRCC) under the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET), support integration of \nMongolia\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) into policies and projects, and improve \nengagement of civil society in climate change adaptation initiatives.1 The TA is included in the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) country operations business plan for Mongolia, 2021.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Socioeconomic profile and climate-related risks. Mongolia is extremely vulnerable to \nthe effects of climate change, ranked 67th out of 181 in the 2020 ND-GAIN Index.3 It is also among \nthe most heavily coal-dependent countries in Asia. Greenhouse gas emissions come primarily \nfrom  the  energy  (50.1%)  and  agriculture  (48.5%)  sectors.  Greenhouse  gas  emissions  are \nprojected to increase from 25.8 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2010 to 74.3 million tons by 2030 \nin a business-as-usual scenario.4 From 1940 to 2015, average temperatures increased by 2.2\u00b0C, \ntriple the global average and already beyond the 2\u00b0C set by the Paris Agreement to limit global \nwarming.5 Since 1940, annual precipitation has decreased by 7%, seasonal rainfall patterns have \nbecome erratic,6 and the frequency of extreme weather events such as dzud has increased.7 \n \n3.  Climate  change  impacts.  Climate  change  and  environmental  degradation  present \nsevere risks to (i) water resources management, (ii) biodiversity conservation and ecosystem \nrestoration, and (iii) tourism. Because of the increase in average national temperatures, water \nresources have become more vulnerable to droughts; from 2005 to 2015, about 600 lakes dried \nup (footnote 5). Glacier loss in Mongolia, estimated at 28% since 1940, is expected to continue \nwith the increase in frequency and severity of heatwaves. Water-related disaster risks, including \nriver and flash flooding, are increasing. Flash flooding alone accounted for 24% of deaths caused \nby natural hazards between 2004 and 2015 (footnote 5). Projected climate changes will also have \nkey implications for biodiversity and ecosystems threatening Mongolia\u2019s protected areas, such as \nthe Khuvsgul Lake National Park.8 The combined impacts of climate change and overgrazing is \nalso contributing to the decline of pasture productivity and herding livelihoods. For tourism, climate \nchange may result in greater damage to infrastructure (such as roads and camps), increased \noperation costs for running tourism infrastructure, and decreased number of visitors. Climate \nchange also disproportionally impacts vulnerable rural communities, especially women and youth, \nwho have fewer options for income diversification and other approaches to help offset the impacts \nof climate change. \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 September 2021. \n2  ADB. 2020.

Capacity and institutional challenges to address climate change adaptation. In \ncollaboration  with  key  development  partners,9 the  government  has  launched  the  National \nAdaptation  Plan  process. 10  To  enable  cooperation  and  coordination  among  concerned \ngovernment agencies, private business entities and local environmental civil society organizations\u2019 \n(CSO), the CCRCC was established under the MET in 2020. The CCRCC\u2019s mandate is to ensure \nimplementation  of  Mongolia\u2019s  climate  policies  and  its  NDC  commitments  under  the  Paris \nAgreement, by (i) conducting research, (ii) providing strategic guidance, (iii) promoting civil society \ninitiatives, and (iv) piloting innovative solutions from the private sector. However, three main \nissues constrain CCRCC\u2019s ability to deliver on its mandate and be fully operational. As a newly \nestablished and self-funded state-owned enterprise, CCRCC lacks (i) the financial and technical \ncapacity11 to conduct effective climate risk assessments and report on NDC adaptation actions; \n(ii) strategic coordination and planning ability across line ministries on adaptation measures and \nclimate finance reporting in the natural resources sector;12 and (iii) mechanisms, selection criteria, \nand monitoring tools to engage with local environmental CSOs to support local adaptation and \nresilience initiatives.13  \n \n5.  Government strategy and focus on climate change adaptation. The government has \nadopted a series of policies to mitigate and adapt to climate change. These include the National \nAction Program on Climate Change (2011\u20132021),14 the National Green Development Policy \n(2014\u20132030),15 and Sustainable Development Vision 2030.16 In 2020, the government submitted \nits updated NDCs with a higher mitigation target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 22.7% \nby 2030.17 The government has also finalized the NDC implementation plan, which prioritizes \nsector-specific mitigation and adaptation measures (footnote 4). Areas of national priority for \nadaptation  planning  in  Mongolia  include  arable  farming,  water  and  forestry  resources \nmanagement,  and  biodiversity.18 National  efforts  to  strengthen  climate  change  adaptation \nmeasures and targets will also be key to achieving Mongolia\u2019s obligations as a signatory to the \nParis Agreement and following the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference on Climate \nin 2021. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: adaptation and resilience to climate risks in \nMongolia improved (footnote 15). The TA will have the following outcome: government\u2019s strategic \nplanning capacity for climate change adaptation in the environment and natural resources sector \nimproved and resilience of communities to climate change strengthened.19 The outcome of the \nTA will be achieved by delivering the following interlinked outputs. \n \n \n9  Mongolia joined the NDC partnership in 2017. \n10 Launched in 2019 by the Green Climate Fund and the United Nations Environment Fund. \n11 The total number of staff is 19 and none of them were formally trained to conduct NDCs reporting on climate change \nadaptation, climate vulnerability and risk assessments.  \n12 NDC implementation financial needs are estimated to be $11.5 billion, including $5.2 billion for adaptation. \n13 About 703 nongovernment organizations are registered under the Mongolian Environmental Civil Council. \n14 Government of Mongolia. 2011.

Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Climate Change Research and Cooperation Center capacity to manage \nclimate change risks and strategic planning enhanced. Under output 1, activities will include: \n(i) develop a strategic business and action plan to improve knowledge, operational and technical \ncapacity of the CCRCC; (ii) support the CCRCC in procuring office and technical equipment to \nassist its day-to-day operations (including information and communications technology hardware \nand software, and office furniture, as needed); (iii) develop guidelines on climate risk assessment, \nclimate-related  financial  risk  management,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  track  the \neffectiveness of adaptation measures and pathways for NDC reporting; and (iv) based on these \nguidelines, provide training for trainers on climate risk assessment; climate-related financial risk \nmanagement; gender mainstreaming; and monitoring, reporting, and verification to guide project \nofficers in effective NDC reporting and valuation of climate adaptation projects. \n \n8.  Output 2: Guidance for integrating Nationally Determined Contribution adaptation \ntargets into policies, strategic planning, and projects developed. Under output 2, activities \nwill include (i) identify suitable adaptation measures to be prioritized in the three subsectors, (a) \nwater resources management, (b) biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration, and (c) \necotourism, in alignment with ADB's lending portfolio; 20 (ii) develop pre-feasibility studies that can \nlead to a pipeline of projects in selected aimags (provinces), to strengthen public policies for \nclimate change adaptation and promote blended finance mechanisms;21 (iii) design a capacity-\nbuilding program for national climate focal points and ministerial representatives (including in \nwater,  environment,  agriculture,  and  finance)  on  conducting  climate  vulnerability  and  NDC \nadaptation  assessments  and  mainstreaming  gender  in  adaptation  projects,  report  on  the \nimplementation of NDCs and prepare biennial transparency reports in compliance with the \nmonitoring, reporting, and verification arrangements under the Paris Agreement;22 (iv) integrate \nNDC adaptation targets into comprehensive land management and local adaptation plans of \nselected aimags in project areas; and (v) share lessons learned with other development partners \nand ADB developing member countries. \n \n9.  Output 3: Environmental civil society organizations engaged in the design and \nimplementation of adaptation initiatives. Under output 3, activities will include (i) procedures \nfor selecting, awarding, monitoring, and evaluating CSO initiatives to be funded23 in selected \naimags in three subsectors will be developed;24 (ii) the CCRCC and ADB will jointly publish and \nmanage the call for proposals and will form a steering committee to screen, select, and award the \nCSO initiatives; (iii) the CCRCC will engage a selected batch of CSOs in the development of a \npipeline of adaptation projects under output 3; and (iv) ADB Youth for Asia and its network of \n \n20 Measures can include water savings and water treatment technologies, hydrological and water quality monitoring \nsystems, flood early warning systems, water allocation plans, valuing mechanisms for ecosystem services protection \nand nature conservation, and promotion of ecotourism as an alternative source of income for local livelihoods. \n21 These pre-feasibility studies will form the basis for identifying viable business models and supporting mechanisms. \n22 The focus of the training program will be to enhance focal points' capacity to carry out adaptation assessments and \nNDC reporting and planning; design related policies; and improve coordination across ministries and governance \nlevels to act on climate change, in compliance with the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris \nAgreement.  \n23 A total of $300,000 of the TA budget will be allocated to fund CSO initiatives jointly selected by CCRCC and ADB. \nEach CSO will be allocated about $10,000 each (for a maximum of 30 CSOs). This support will provide funding \nsupport to environmental CSOs for initiatives to raise awareness and foster community engagement on issues related \nto building local resilience to climate change. \n24 Three aimags (Arkhangai in southern Mongolia, Bayanhongor in the west, and Selenge in the north) were preselected \nas areas for CSO activities based on their geographic vulnerability to climate change impacts and local capacity and \nfinancing gaps. The final selection of aimags will be made during the TA inception phase. \n \n ", "4 \nyoung professionals will organize an intergenerational youth-led climate change awareness and \naction for community resilience campaign.25 \n \n10.  Added value. The TA will create synergies with ADB's lending portfolio in Mongolia, \nincluding the Sustainable Tourism Development Project (Phase 2);26 and the Aimags and Soums \nGreen  Regional  Development  Investment  Program.27 The  TA  will  also  generate  regional \nknowledge spillover under a One ADB approach with other initiatives, such as the NDC Advance \nplatform,28 the Regional Flyway Initiative, and the Natural Capital Lab.29 The TA activities will \nmainly contribute to operational priority 3 of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: tackling climate change, \nbuilding  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability;  and \noperational priority 2: accelerating progress in gender equality.30  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7), and (ii) $600,000 will be financed \non  a  grant  basis  by the  Climate  Change  Fund.31 The  key  expenditure  items  are  listed  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n12.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of remuneration and travel \nexpenses of counterpart staff, access to relevant government data and studies for the TA \nconsultants\u2019 use, use of meeting rooms, access to internet, office facilities for counterpart staff, \nprovisions of studies and documents for the TA activities, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA. The Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Division \nof ADB\u2019s East Asia Department will coordinate the implementation of the TA in close collaboration \nwith the Mongolia Resident Mission and the Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment.  ADB  will  select,  supervise,  and  evaluate  the  TA  consultants  throughout \nTA implementation. \n \n14.  MET will be the executing agency and provide oversight, coordination, and guidance for \nthe  TA  implementation.  The  CCRCC  will  serve  as  the  implementing  agency  and  will  be \nresponsible for coordination of the TA activities and delivery of outputs and liaison with other \n \n25 The youth population (aged 15\u201324 years old) in Mongolia represents about one-third of the population and is \nparticularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Acknowledging the potential of young people to lead climate \naction campaigns, the campaign aims to (i) increase awareness of youth on climate change, specifically climate \nfinancing, carbon pricing, green jobs, gender mainstreaming, and adaptation strategies; (ii) elevate voice and vision \nof youth on climate action and NDCs; and (iii) support youth-led adaptation projects. \n26 ADB.
