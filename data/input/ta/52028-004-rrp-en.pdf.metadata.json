THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the Jharkhand Urban Water Supply Improvement Project. \n \n2.  The  project  will  support  urban  service  improvement  and  policy  initiatives  of  the \nGovernment of Jharkhand (GOJ) to contribute to improved quality of life under the Jharkhand \nVision and Action Plan 2021.1 The project will complement ongoing efforts of the GOJ for water \nsupply infrastructure and service improvement and institutional reforms under various national \nflagship programs.2 The project will finance water supply infrastructure investments in four \nproject towns: the state capital of Ranchi, and the economically and socially backward towns of \nHussainabad, Jhumri Telaiya, and Medininagar. It will also address capacity and institutional \ngovernance issues in the sector for sustainable urban service delivery. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  State  economy  and  urbanization. Jharkhand state is rich in minerals and natural \nresources, resulting in the presence of big industrial areas with the opportunity for further \ndevelopment because of encouraging government policies. The state has seen strong and \nsteady growth since 2015. However, based on 2011 census data, it is less urbanized (24.05%) \nthan the national average (31.20%), although its urbanization rate is projected to catch up with \nother Indian states after 2030. The state is categorized as a low-income state, as its per capita \nincome of \u20b979,873 was less than the national average of \u20b9134,432 in fiscal year (FY) 2020. The \nstate\u2019s  multidimensional  poverty  index  (percentage  population  in  multidimensional  poverty) \nbased on data for the years 2015 and 2016 was 46.5% compared to India\u2019s 27.9%.3 \n \n4.  Sector issues. The water supply services in Jharkhand are below national service level \nstandards  because  of  low  coverage,  with  intermittent  and  unsafe  water  supply.  The  weak \nfinancial resources and human resource capacity constraints of urban local bodies (ULBs) are \nthe  main  limitations,  leading  to  low  investments  in  new  and  improved  infrastructure,  poor \noperation and maintenance (O&M), and deterioration of assets.4 These result in poor quality of \nlife  of  inhabitants,  constrained urbanization  and  growth,  and  low  competitiveness  of  cities. \nAccess to basic services like water supply is critical to women and other vulnerable populations\u2019 \nwellbeing, and the lack of this access exacerbates women\u2019s drudgery and time poverty. The \nproject towns get on an average 3\u20134 hours of daily water supply at 10\u201335 liters per capita per \nday (lpcd). The coverage of piped water supply is about 30% for Ranchi and less than 20% for \nthe  other  project towns.  The  nonrevenue  water  in currently  limited  project  service  area  is \nestimated at 45% because of physical and commercial losses. Urban infrastructure is at risk \nfrom disasters caused by natural hazards and future climate change impacts, which include \nincreasing variances in temperature, and high-intensity storms, which may all disrupt intended \nservice delivery. \n \n1  GOJ. 2014. Jharkhand Vision and Action Plan 2021. Ranchi. \n2  The national flagship programs launched by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs include the Atal Mission for \nRejuvenation and Urban Transformation, Smart Cities Mission, and Swachh Bharat Mission. \n3  UNDP and OPHI. 2019. Global Multidimensional Poverty Index 2019.  \n4  On average, statewide coverage of piped treated water supply is below 25% (national average: 70%), the quantum \nof water supplied is 56 liters per capita per day (lpcd) against a benchmark of 135 lpcd, daily water supply is 3.7 \nhours, and estimated nonrevenue water is 45% against a benchmark of less than 15%. \n ", "2 \n5.  Urban governance. The state has 43 ULBs, which includes four project towns, are \ngoverned by the Jharkhand Municipal Act of 2011.5 Only 57.8% of the urban population (or \n13.9% of the total population) of the state that falls under these 43 ULBs, is governed by elected \nmunicipal administrations; the remaining population is governed by institutions appointed by the \nGOJ. ULBs are responsible for service delivery of all key functions such as water supply, \nsewerage, solid waste management, roads, urban planning, and building permissions. The \nUrban Development and Housing Department (UDHD) is the administrative department for the \nurban sector in Jharkhand and oversees the ULBs and other state-level entities in urban sector. \nOverall, Jharkhand\u2019s institutional structure is harmonized, but key state institutions are new and \nwould require support in building capacity in project design, implementation, and management.6 \n \n6.  Financial situation of urban local bodies. The revenue base of ULBs mainly consists \nof property tax, user charges, and fees for renting out public space for advertisements. ULBs\u2019 \nown sources of revenue in Jharkhand are much lower compared to those in other states of India \nin spite of significant property tax reforms undertaken in the state.7  The financial assessment of \na mix of ULBs in Jharkhand for FY2017 indicates that the average per capita own-source \nrevenue was \u20b9251, while the all-India average was \u20b92,360. Similarly, the average per capita \nexpenditure was \u20b9544, while the all-India average was \u20b92,702.8 The reasons for low revenue \nare  (i)  low  tax  rates  and  user  charges,  (ii)  low  tax  collection  efficiency,  and  \n(iii)  poor  service  coverage  resulting  in  lower  user  charges.  All  ULBs have migrated to  an \naccrual-based double-entry accounting system, and annual financial statements have been \npublicly disclosed since FY2013. The credit rating of 41 ULBs shows only Ranchi has received \nan investment-grade rating in the lowest slab.9 \n \n7.  Urban institutional capacity. The ULBs in Jharkhand lack adequate permanent staff \nand rely mainly on a small number of contractual staff. Technical staff are limited to junior or \nexecutive engineers on deputation from other departments. Most of the services, including \naccounts, are outsourced through short-term service contracts. Lack of adequate municipal staff \nis also reflected in the poor utilization of funds. Also, ULBs do not use information technology in \naccounting, asset management, and service provision. There is low participation rate of urban \nfemales (6.6%) in the workforce, which is below the national average (14.7%).10 \n \n8.  Government urban programs. The GOJ is committed to enhancing the quality of life of \nits  urban  inhabitants  by  developing  sustainable  cities  that  are  spatially,  economically,  and \nsocially  inclusive  (footnote  1).  The  UDHD  has  developed  urban  strategies  and  policies  to \nprovide  100%  basic  infrastructure  to  the  urban  population  by  2030,  thereby  making  cities \nefficient,  productive,  and  inclusive.  The  key  focus  areas  include  providing  access  to  safe \n \n5  The 43 ULBs comprise the following: 7 municipal corporations, 2 notified area committees of Jamshedpur and \nMango (which is in transition to become a municipal corporation), 1 municipality, 18 nagar parishads (city councils), \nand 15 nagar panchayats (town councils). \n6  Jharkhand Urban Infrastructure Development Company Limited is the key state institution involved in urban \ninfrastructure relevant to this project, which is responsible for implementing urban projects and handing over the \ncompleted assets to ULBs. \n7  Property tax reforms consisted of (i) governance reforms by amendment in the Jharkhand Municipal Act (2011) and \nProperty Tax Rules (2013), and introduction of Property Tax Collection and Recovery Rules (2017); (ii) introduction \nof public\u2013private partnerships in tax collection and monitoring; (iii) integration of tax and nontax revenue; and (iv) \nspreading of awareness through continuous information, education, and communication campaigns. \n8  ADB. 2019.

The budgetary allocation for the urban sector in the \nstate\u2019s budget has more than doubled since FY2016, which reflects the state\u2019s prioritization of \nthe urban sector.11 Private investment in the sector is unlikely because of the lack of benchmark \ndata on water supply system performance and low tariffs for cost recovery. However, the project \nis designed for short- to medium-term private sector engagement in O&M of the assets. \n \n9.  Alignment with ADB and country priorities. GOJ is investing significantly in urban \ninfrastructure including strengthening of urban institutions and building staff capacities under \nnational flagship programs. GOJ is seeking additional support for these activities from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and other multilateral agencies.12 The project will be ADB\u2019s first urban \nproject in the state and aims to develop urban infrastructure for improved service delivery and \naddress capacity and institutional governance issues. The project targets critical investments in \nselect towns, as increasing water supply service coverage more rapidly is the topmost priority of \nthe GOJ during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.13 The state is already taking \nsteps to improve sanitation in the project towns and has requested ADB\u2019s continued support in a \nsubsequent loan for sewerage and fecal sludge and septage management projects, which are \nunder  planning  stage.14 The  project  will  support  the  operational  priorities  (OPs)  of  ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2030  for  making  cities  more  livable  (OP  4),  and  strengthening  governance  and \ninstitutional capacity (OP 6).15 The project also contributes to addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities (OP 1) and accelerating progress in gender equality (OP 2) by improving \nwater supply in economically and socially backward areas. The project supports building climate \nand disaster resilience and enhancing environmental sustainability by designing water supply \ninfrastructure with climate resilient features (OP 3). The project is closely aligned with ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022, which envisages inclusive growth of low-\nincome states.16 \n \n10.  Lessons.  ADB  will  bring  its  experience  in  implementing  physical  infrastructure \ndevelopment, institutional capacity building, and urban sector reforms in other states of India \nand other countries to develop sustainable infrastructure. Considering that Jharkhand is a low-\nincome state with limited capacity, the project will build upon ADB\u2019s experience and lessons \nthrough (i) ensuring high project readiness with contracts worth 50% of the project cost  already \nawarded,  and  the  balance  contracts  are  in  advanced  stages  of  tendering;  \n(ii)  incorporating  a  5-year  O&M  period  in  all  construction  contracts  to  ensure  continuous \noperation  by  the  private  sector  while  staff  members  of  ULBs  get  trained  on  sustainable \n \n11 The budgetary allocation for the urban sector was \u20b914 billion for FY2016, and \u20b929.7 billion for FY2020. \n12 The  World  Bank  approved  the  Jharkhand  Municipal  Development  Project  on  12  December  2018  with  a \ncommitment amount of $147 million. Dhanbad and Khunti towns are covered under this project. \n13 The state has a moderate number of COVID-19 cases (about 1% of the total cases in the country as of June 2021). \nHowever, the state experienced significant economic impacts because of lockdown in 2020 and slow economic \nrecovery thereafter. \n14 The sewerage system is under construction in part of Ranchi. Fecal sludge and septage management (FSSM) is \ntendered out in Jhumri Telaiya. Consultants are engaged for the preparation of detailed project reports for \nsewerage and/or FSSM system in other towns. As per Jharkhand\u2019s FSSM Policy (2017), a comprehensive \nsewerage system is planned for eight big towns (including Ranchi), while FSSM projects are planned for state\u2019s \nother towns, including the other three project towns. \n15 ADB. 2018.

Relevance to pandemic mitigation. The project is highly relevant to mitigating the \ncauses of epidemics and pandemics similar in nature to the COVID-19 pandemic, as it will \nestablish a water supply system essential for safe sanitation and hygiene.17 Public awareness \ncampaigns and focus group discussions will be conducted under the project through behavior \nchange activities focusing on water conservation, sanitation, health, and hygiene. As the GOJ \nand ULBs are looking to the post-COVID-19 pandemic recovery efforts, the project will provide \nemployment  opportunities  for  both  unskilled  and  skilled  labor,  including  for  the  poor  and \nvulnerable during construction and O&M, and will also stimulate the local economy. High project \nreadiness, a 7-year implementation period, and sufficient contingencies provide an adequate \ncushion for potential implementation delays and cost increases associated with COVID-19. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impact: sustainable cities that are spatially, \neconomically, and socially inclusive developed (footnote 1). The project will have the following \noutcome: water supply services and urban governance in project towns improved.18 \n \n13.  Output 1: Water supply infrastructure in four project towns improved. The project \nwill finance water supply infrastructure investments in four project towns. The investments \ninvolve construction and 5 years of performance-based O&M of piped water supply systems in \nproject towns comprising (i) four water treatment plants with a combined capacity of 275 million \nliters  per  day,  meeting  the  Indian  drinking  water  quality  standard  (IS:10500);  and  (ii)  940 \nkilometers of water distribution network connected to about 115,000 households to provide \ncontinuous water supply, with the share of nonrevenue water reduced from the current level of \n45% to 20%. The water supply will have universal coverage, including households (a) below \npoverty line, (b) comprising scheduled caste and/or scheduled tribe members, and (c) with \npersons with disabilities in the project areas. \n \n14.  Output 2: Institutional capacity for sustainable urban service delivery and urban \ngovernance  improved.  The  physical  investments  will  be  complemented  with  targeted \ninstitutional and financial reforms and capacity building to create an institutional framework for \nthe ULBs in Jharkhand to replicate and follow. These include: \n(i)  a sustainable water sector asset management strategy, including a volumetric tariff-\nbased user charges policy prepared and implemented in project towns;19 \n(ii)  an urban reforms policy on strengthening own-source revenues of ULBs prepared \nwith three key actions implemented in project towns; \n(iii)  information  technology-enabled  systems  for  water  service  delivery  and \nadministration adopted in Ranchi through the use of a supervisory control and data \nacquisition (SCADA) system for water supply operation; and mapping of assets, \nproperties, and revenue database on geographic information system; \n(iv)  training  of  relevant  staff  on  (a)  design  and  implementation  of  urban  services, \nincluding response to climate risks; (b) institutional development, urban governance, \n \n17 World Health Organization. 2020.

The project will provide vocational training \nfor employable job skills in construction and O&M of water supply assets to at least \n100 community members (including 50 women). \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n15.  The project will introduce innovative technologies, such as recycle of filter backwash \nwater in water treatment, use of a SCADA system for water supply operation and geographic \ninformation system-based asset management in Ranchi for efficient service delivery. These \ninterventions will be introduced for the first time in a state where water supply service delivery is \nat a nascent stage. The proposed institutional strengthening and governance improvement \nactivities are aligned with the reforms being undertaken through national flagship programs \n(footnote  2)  and  other  development  partners  (footnote  12).  The  project  will  support  the \npreparation of a sustainable water sector asset management strategy, including a user charges \npolicy for O&M cost recovery across ULBs in Jharkhand. 21 The project will further support the \npreparation  of  an  urban  reforms  policy  framework  to  enhance  own-source  revenues  and \nresource mobilization by ULBs in Jharkhand. There will be a growing focus on providing tap \nwater for all households by 2025 under recently launched national flagship program (Jal Jeevan \nMission). The project will establish a model for continuous water supply with policy reforms and \na contractual framework for sustainable operation, which will be documented and disseminated \nfor replication by Jharkhand and other low-income states in India under Jal Jeevan Mission.22 \nThe service level benchmark and revenue data, coupled with institutional and governance \nreforms, will pave the way for future private sector participation in urban services, including the \nopportunity for ADB\u2019s involvement in the next phase of investment. \n \nD.

Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity is 15.75 years, and the \nmaturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per year. \n \n18.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation \nto (i) civil works, equipment and goods, and consultants; (ii) O&M costs during the first 3 years \nof the O&M period (excluding power costs);24 and (iii) physical and price contingencies. The \n F\nGOJ will provide $48 million to the investment costs of the project to finance (i) taxes and duties, \n(ii) incremental recurrent costs, (iii) financing charges during implementation, and (iv) part of the \ncivil  works  and  contingencies  and  will  provide  the  loan  and  counterpart  funds  to  the \nimplementing agency as a grant. The GOJ has assured ADB that it will meet any financing \nshortfall to support the full achievement of the project outputs. \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)  112.0  70.0 \nGovernment of Jharkhand  48.0  30.0 \nTotal  160.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n19.  Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $5.64 million (use of energy-efficient pumping and \nphysical loss reduction in water distribution system), and climate adaptation is estimated to cost \n$7.548 million (use of flexible expansion joints along selected segments of the distribution \nnetwork to enhance network stability in the event of extreme flood, control of volume of water \nthrough instrumentation and automation, use of flow meters, recycle of filter backwash water \nand institutional capacity development to raise awareness on climate change). ADB will finance \n$4.54 million of mitigation costs and $6.115 million of adaptation costs. The use of energy-\nefficient pumping and physical loss reduction in water distribution system is expected to reduce \nelectricity  consumption  from  pumping  requirements,  resulting  in  reduced  greenhouse  gas \nemissions.25 \n \n \n24 If the 5 years performance-based O&M coverage is crossing the loan closing date due to delayed construction, \nthen ADB loan financing of O&M cost will be less than 3 years. \n25 The estimated greenhouse gas emission reduction of 8,640 tons of carbon dioxide per year was calculated using \nthe International Financial Institutions Technical Working Group\u2019s harmonized grid emission factor of 673 grams of \ncarbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour for India. \n ", "7 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The  UDHD,  acting  through  Jharkhand  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Company \nLimited (JUIDCO), will be the executing agency, responsible for overall strategic planning, \nguidance, and management of the project. JUIDCO, as the implementing agency, will establish \na project management unit (PMU) and four project implementation units (PIUs) with fulltime staff \nto  monitor  project  implementation.26 JUIDCO  has  appointed  consultants  for  construction \nsupervision and project management. A separate consulting firm is engaged under the project \n(as a PMU consultant) for carrying out overall reporting and monitoring compliance with ADB \npolicies and regulations, including safeguards. \n \n21.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 23). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  June 2021\u2013May 2028 \nEstimated completion date  31 May 2028 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 November 2028 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Empowered committee \nDevelopment commissioner (chair) \nHeads of Finance Department, Planning Department and UDHD of \nGOJ (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  UDHD acting through JUIDCO \n(iii)  Implementing agency  JUIDCO \n(iv)  Implementing unit  One project management unit in Ranchi (16 staff) \nFour project implementation units (29 staff) \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding  1 contract  $76.00 million \n(internationally advertised) \nOpen competitive bidding  4 contracts  $52.70 million \n(nationally advertised) \nRequest for quotations  10 contracts  $0.80 million \nConsulting  QCBS (80:20) (3  742 person-months  $1.87 million \nservices  contracts)  504 person-months  $0.50 million  \n378 person-months  $1.60 million \nIndividual consultants (20)  551 person-months  $1.00 million \nRetroactive  Advance contracting is for the procurement of works and consulting services under the project. \nfinancing and  Retroactive financing will apply to up to 20% of the loan amount for the above contracts incurred prior \nadvance  to the effectiveness of the loan agreement but not earlier than 12 months prior to the signing of the \ncontracting   loan agreement. \nDisbursement  Disbursement of the loan proceeds will follow ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as \namended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between the Government of India, \nGOJ and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GOJ = Government of Jharkhand, JUIDCO = Jharkhand Urban Infrastructure \nDevelopment Company Limited, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, UDHD = Urban Development and \nHousing Department. \nSource: ADB. \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n22.  ADB  conducted  technical  due  diligence  for  all  subprojects,  including  review  of  the \ndetailed project reports, design parameters, and cost estimates to ensure that these subprojects \n \n26 The PIUs are to be located in Hussainabad, Jhumri Telaiya, Medininagar and Ranchi. \n ", "8 \nare feasible and that there are no significant risks during implementation.27 ADB also reviewed \nthe designs of the subprojects to minimize environmental and social safeguards risks, and \nmaximize project benefits. All the cost estimates of the subprojects have been updated to 2021 \nprice level. The water supply system for project towns incorporates house service connections, \nincluding installation of water meters. The project design has incorporated climate- and disaster-\nresilient measures based on a climate risk assessment and disaster maps for the state and \nproject  areas.  The  water  treatment  plants  are  equipped  with  an  online  quality  monitoring \nsystem, which tracks various stages of the treatment process and is connected to the SCADA \nsystem. All the civil and mechanical and electrical work installations are designed considering \nhigh flood levels, as well as extreme dry seasons because of climate change impacts. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n23.  Economic analysis. The economic rationale for the government\u2019s intervention is sound, \nas the project aims to provide stronger and more sustainable urban basic services focusing on \nwater supply. The economic analysis evaluated the economic viability of interventions proposed \nunder the project.28 The estimated economic internal rates of return of the subprojects ranged \nfrom 10.4% to 22.2%, while the combined economic internal rate of return was estimated at \n13.3%,  higher than  the  economic  opportunity cost  of  capital  estimated  at  9.0%,  indicating \nsignificant economic returns. Sensitivity analysis also revealed satisfactory results, except under \nthe scenario of all downside risks occurring together, i.e., (i) capital cost overrun of 20%,  \n(ii) O&M cost overrun of 20%, (iii) decline in estimated benefits of 20%, (iv) 1-year delay in \nimplementation,  and  (v)  a  change  in  benefit  composition  to  non-incremental  at  80%  and \nincremental  at  20%.  The  project  is  expected  to  further  increase  its  economic  viability  if \nunquantifiable benefits like environmental improvements are considered. \n \n24.  Financial analysis. The ULBs will own the water supply assets, and new assets created \nunder the project will be handed over to respective ULBs for O&M. Financial analysis was \nconducted for the project in accordance with ADB guidelines.29 The analysis revealed that the \nproject will not generate enough revenues for full O&M cost recovery through the existing tariff \nstructures.30 All project town ULBs receive revenues from taxes, user charges, and external \ngrant resources. The revenue enhancement for provision of sustainable water services in the \nlong run is proposed to be through (i) implementation of volumetric water tariffs, (ii) periodic \nrevisions of water tariffs, (iii) improved tariff collection efficiency, and (iv) overall enhancement of \nown-source revenues. The revenue gap until full O&M cost recovery is achieved will be filled \nwith other sources of revenue and the GOJ\u2019s financial support. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n25.  The poor financial health and weak staff capacity of the ULBs are common issues that \napply to Jharkhand as well, and they pose a high risk for the project\u2019s financial sustainability. \nThe  ULBs  of  the  project  towns  were  evaluated  on  their  own-source  revenues,  collection \nefficiency, and dependence on GOJ support. This analysis took into consideration the financial \nresources required to operate and maintain the existing assets, incremental funds required to \noperate and maintain the additional assets created under this project to deliver the services at \n \n27 The subprojects include: (i) Hussainabad water supply, (ii) Jhumri Telaiya water supply, (iii) Medininagar water \nsupply, (iv) Ranchi intake works, and (v) Ranchi water supply. \n28 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 ADB. 2019. Financial Analysis and Evaluation: Technical Guidance Note.

The  financial  projections  show  that  the \nproject ULBs would need the GOJ\u2019s support to cover their O&M expenditure for the initial period \nuntil the policy reforms bear tangible results. The project will therefore finance O&M of physical \ninfrastructure during the initial 3 years of operation. Similarly, the capacities of ULB staff will be \ndeveloped during the initial 5 years of O&M period for subsequent sustainable operation. As \npart of institutional strengthening and governance reforms, a sustainable water sector asset \nmanagement  strategy,  including  volumetric  tariff-based  user  charges  policy  for  O&M  cost \nrecovery, will be prepared. An action plan will be developed with measurable and progressive \nmilestones to help monitor improvements in fiscal performance of the ULBs and the GOJ. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n26.  A financial management assessment has been conducted for JUIDCO in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  guidelines. 31  The  assessment  found  that  JUIDCO  has  adequate  financial \nmanagement capacity to (i) record the required financial transactions, (ii) provide reliable annual \nfinancial reports, and (iii) safeguard the financial assets. The assessed pre-mitigation financial \nmanagement risk is substantial mainly because of the following: (i) JUIDCO has no experience \nin implementing ADB-financed projects, (ii) some accounts staff positions are still vacant in the \nPMU and the PIUs, (iii) noncompliance issues were identified in the entity\u2019s external audit, and \n(iv) there is scope for improving the efficiency of JUIDCO\u2019s internal audit function. These risks \nwill be mitigated through (i) filling the vacant accounts positions in the PMU and PIUs, (ii) \nproviding continuous training on ADB\u2019s financial management requirements and disbursement \nprocedures, (iii) ADB financial management staff will be part of ADB project implementation \nteam to monitor the financial management action plan and financial covenants included in the \nloan  agreement,  (iv)  including  comprehensive  financial  information  in  the  quarterly  project \nprogress reports submitted to ADB, and (v) strengthening JUIDCO\u2019s internal audit function.  \n \n27.  All  procurement  of  goods,  works  and  consultant  services  will  adhere  to  the  ADB \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). Value for money shall be achieved using \nthe contract modality with 5 years of performance-based O&M built into the works contracts. \nThe use of electronic procurement shall promote transparency and efficiency in the procurement \nprocess. \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the GOJ and the UDHD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n29.  The project design is pro-poor, socially inclusive, and gender responsive. The project \naims to provide universal, safe piped water supply through connections to 115,000 household, \nincluding  below  poverty  line  and  vulnerable  households.  These  include  households  in  the \nproject area with scheduled caste, scheduled tribe members, and persons with disabilities. The \nproject  will  give  preference  to  poor  and  vulnerable  persons,  including  women,  in  project \nconstruction  work  and O&M-related  activities. A  stakeholder  consultation  and management \nsupport consultant will be responsible for helping to organize skill training and consultations, \n \n31 ADB. 2015. Financial Management Technical Guidance Note: Financial Management Assessment. Manila. \n ", "10 \nand public awareness campaigns during project implementation. A separate budget is allocated \nin the loan for these activities. The strategy for water charges for O&M cost recovery will be \ndeveloped considering affordability for the poor and vulnerable. \n \n30.  Gender. Gender analysis carried out by ADB reveals that women and girls are primarily \nresponsible for water collection, management, and household sanitation, and that they spend \nmore time than men on water management, which constrains their ability to engage in skills \ndevelopment  and  income-generating,  social,  and  leisure  activities.  Through  the  household \nconnections, the project will directly address the water crisis in the project towns and women\u2019s \ntime poverty in fetching poor quality water from bore wells, hand pumps, and tankers. The \nproject is categorized effective gender mainstreaming, and a gender action plan (GAP) has \nbeen prepared, which includes a monitoring framework supported by adequate human and \nfinancial resources for implementation. Responding to the gender equality issues identified, the \nGAP  aims  to  (i)  provide  certified  vocational  training  for  community  members;  (ii)  raise \nawareness  of  the  benefits  of  household  water  supply  for  residents,  including  women;  (iii) \nleverage the capacities of women\u2019s self-help groups representing the poor living in slums as \ncommunication and change agents; and (iv) build capacities of JUIDCO, PMU, PIUs and ULBs \non gender in urban infrastructure and impact assessment. The GAP is in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.32 \n \n32.  Environment (category B). Subprojects are mostly located in and around urban areas \nwhere there are no notable environmentally sensitive areas or physical cultural resources. \nJUIDCO has conducted initial environmental examinations (IEEs) and prepared five IEE reports \nfor subprojects including corresponding environmental management plans (EMPs). The IEEs \nwill be further reviewed once detailed site studies and engineering designs are completed. The \nIEEs  will  be  disclosed  in  language  and  form  understandable  to  stakeholders  and  project \ncommunities.  Findings  of  the  IEEs  demonstrate  that  subprojects  are  not  likely  to  cause \nsignificant adverse environmental impacts that are irreversible, diverse, or unprecedented. The \nenvironmental impacts during construction and operations are site-specific, short in duration, \nand can be avoided and/or mitigated through design considerations and by measures identified \nin  the  EMPs.  Stakeholder  engagement  and  consultations  were  carried  out  during  project \npreparation and will be continued throughout implementation. Environmental grievances will be \nhandled following the grievance redress mechanism as explained in PAM (footnote 23). The \nstaffing to address environmental safeguards compliance comprise of one full-time manager \n(environment) already appointed in PMU, and one full-time assistant manager (environment) are \nbeing appointed in PIUs. All statutory clearances and no-objection letters will be obtained prior \nto award of contracts. The safeguards and EHS orientation will be provided to the contractors \nbefore start of construction. The contractors are required to submit site-specific EMPs, and \nappoint environment, health, and safety officers prior to commencement of works to ensure \ncompliance  with  local  laws,  and  regulations  on  labor  and  workers.  The  PMU  will  prepare \nsemiannual environmental monitoring reports for ADB\u2019s review and disclosure. \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). Following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, \nJUIDCO has prepared a resettlement and indigenous peoples plan for Ranchi\u2019s water supply \n \n32 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "11 \nsubproject. Due diligence reports have been prepared for four subprojects, where no potential \ninvoluntary impacts are expected. All these documents will be disclosed to affected persons in \nthe local language. The land required for construction of various subproject components is \ngovernment owned. The GOJ\u2019s Land Revenue Department will transfer the land ownership to \nthe UDHD, and a no-objection certificate will be provided to JUIDCO for utilizing the land for all \nsubprojects  before  the  commencement  of  civil  works.  Temporary  livelihood  impacts  to  49 \nshopkeepers during construction are expected in Ranchi. JUIDCO will provide compensation for \ntemporary loss of income and assistance prior to the start of civil works. The social safeguards \ndocuments will be updated during the final detailed design and detailed measurement survey. \nThe proposed mitigation measures and safeguard planning documents are adequate to address \nthe assessed temporary livelihood impacts. The PMU will prepare semiannual social safeguard \nmonitoring reports for ADB\u2019s review and disclosure. The social safeguards staffing consists of a \nfulltime social safeguards officer appointed at the PMU and four fulltime social safeguards \nofficers  being  appointed  in  the  PIUs.  Capacity  building  will  continue  to  be  provided  to \nsafeguards staff of the PMU and PIUs.  \n \n34.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  B). The project shall have positive impacts on the \nscheduled tribes. All scheduled tribe households will benefit from the project and requirements \nfor meaningful consultation will be ensured. Only five shopkeepers from scheduled tribes will \nexperience temporary loss of income during pipe laying and road construction for a maximum \nperiod of 15 days in Ranchi, and compensation will be provided accordingly. According to 2011 \ncensus data, Jharkhand had a population of 32.99 million, of which 8.65 million were members \nof scheduled tribes.33 A scheduled tribe population of 218,798 in the project towns will benefit \nfrom the project. The indigenous peoples impacts have been assessed as positive and the \ncombined resettlement and indigenous peoples plan document for Ranchi is prepared.34 \n \n35.  Disasters  and  climate  change.  A  comprehensive  climate  risk  and  vulnerability \nassessment (CRVA) has been carried out to assess associated potential risks of climate change \nimpacts and vulnerability of project components.35 The project has a climate risk category of \nmedium, with potential contributions to climate adaptation and mitigation finance. Based on the \nCRVA findings, mitigation measures to address climate change-related impacts are built into the \ndesign. The project infrastructure is subjected to climate change from variation in temperature \nand precipitation. Additionally, floods from storm surges and potential inundation may also \nimpact service delivery, and the design takes into account enhancement of the stability of water \ndistribution system through use of flexible expansion joints. The CRVA confirmed that the \nproject water source is adequate to meet the future water demand and is not threatened by \nimpacts of climate change. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n36.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.36 \n \n \n \n \n33 The proportion of the scheduled tribes are (i) 0.27% in Hussainabad, (ii) 0.45% in Jhumri Telaiya, (iii) 1.66% in \nMedininagar, and (iv) 20.21% in Ranchi. \n34 Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples Plan for Ranchi (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nLow financial capacity of ULBs constrains  The GOJ and project ULBs will prepare and implement strategic plans \nsustainability of the services  for full O&M cost recovery, including the adoption of a volumetric tariff, \nan increase in collection efficiency, and a reduction in nonrevenue \nwater.
