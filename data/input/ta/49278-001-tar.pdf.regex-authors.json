INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Mongolia requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to strengthen public hospital autonomy. A fact-finding mission took place in Ulaanbaatar \nin August 2015, and ADB reached an agreement with the government on the impact, outcome, \nand  outputs  of the  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA),  as  well  as  its  cost  and \nfinancing,  the  implementation  arrangements,  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting \nservices. Concept clearance was obtained on 22 October 2015. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Poor quality of health services in public hospitals is considered a major constraint. The \npublic sector accounts for 78% of total hospital beds and 80% of total hospital admissions, and \nabsorbs nearly 70% of the national health budget.2 International experience and best practices \ntend to confirm that the lack of autonomy in decision making in public hospitals, especially in \nrelation  to  financing,  human  resources  management,  and  procurement,  is  an  important \ndeterminant of poor health service delivery.3 The Ministry of Health and Sports (MOHS) tends to \nmicromanage public hospitals by defining the hospitals\u2019 strategies; allocating and regulating \ntheir budgets; appointing their executive management; managing their human resources; and \nhandling the procurement of all major equipment, drugs, and supplies.4  \n \n3.  Public hospitals are financed from the state budget, the health insurance fund, and user \nfees.  Hospital  managers  are  constrained  by  rigid  financing  procedures  that  lead  to  major \ninefficiencies. For instance, hospital managers are not allowed to reallocate resources between \ncost categories without obtaining permission from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), which can \ntake considerable time and  effort.  Savings  at  the  end  of the fiscal  year  are  automatically \nreturned  to  the  Treasury,  discouraging  hospital  managers  from  becoming  more  efficient. \nHospital managers also lack the means to reward staff for good performances since not even \nsavings  can  be  used  to  supplement  salaries. This results  in  less motivated  staff  and  low \nperformance of public hospitals, including poor quality of services.5 Public hospitals mostly \nserve poor and low-middle-income people, who make up about 60% of the total population \n(higher-income citizens tend to seek care from private hospitals or abroad), so improving public \nhospital management will primarily benefit the poorer and lower-middle-income groups. \n \n4.  The government has made some initial attempts to reform hospital management. The \nrevised Health Law (2011) has provisions for the establishment of hospital management boards \nin state-owned, tertiary-level hospitals.6 However, because of changing priorities and lack of \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 November 2015. \n2  Government of Mongolia, Ministry of Health and Sports. 2015. Health Indicators 2014. Ulaanbaatar. \n3   A. Harding and A.S. Preker, eds. 2003. Innovations in Health Service Delivery. Washington, DC: The World Bank. \nPoor performances of public hospitals are explained by the incentive system the hospital faces, in which autonomy \nof decision making plays an important role. Preker states that incentives result from, first, pressures originating \nfrom  the  external  environment,  and  second,  the  hospital\u2019s  managerial  instruments.  External  pressures  are \ngovernment oversight, organized purchasing (e.g., health insurance), market pressures, and governance from the \nowners of the hospital. Managerial instruments are reflected in the authority or autonomy given to its managers, the \nmarket environment created by the provider payment mechanism and exposure to competition, the extent to which \nthe hospital keeps its surpluses and is responsible for its losses and debts, accountability mechanisms, and the \nextent to which social functions of the hospital are explicit and fully funded. \n4  The Ministry of Health was renamed MOHS in December 2014. \n5  Government of Mongolia, Ministry of Health. 2005. Health Sector Strategic Master Plan 2005\u20132015. Ulaanbaatar. \n6  Tertiary hospitals are regional diagnostic and treatment centers located in aimags (provinces), and state general \nand specialized hospitals in Ulaanbaatar. \n ", "2   \ntechnical capacity of MOHS, no regulations and operational tools exist that would help improve \ngovernance and management of financial and human resources, and aid the implementation of \nhospital autonomy. Implementation of hospital autonomy in a few tertiary-level public hospitals \nin 2011 resulted in merely adding another administrative layer\u2014the management board\u2014which \ncomplicated hospital administration since hospitals continued to operate under the direct control \nof MOHS. MOHS ceased this attempt in 2013. \n \n5.  Overall,  Mongolia  is  developing  a  policy  environment  to  improve  quality  of  health \nservices through the introduction of competition and market elements in the management of \npublic hospitals.7 This objective is in line with the implementation framework of the Health \nSector Strategic Master Plan, 2005\u20132015, to ensure transparency, accountability, autonomy, \nand  appropriate  delegation  of  authority  in  public  hospitals.8 In  July  2015,  the  government \nsubmitted  to  Parliament  a  package  of  draft  legislation  proposals,  which  aims  to  improve \ngovernance  (enhanced  decision-making  power)  and  management  of  public  hospitals  in  a \ncomprehensive way.9 These new pieces of legislation will be closely interconnected with the \nrevised Health Insurance Law (approved by Parliament in January 2015), which enables the \nhealth insurance organization to act as the main purchaser of health services. Autonomy of \nhospitals is a precondition to a sound purchasing process, since it allows hospitals to negotiate \nwith the health insurance organization.  \n \n6.  The capacity of MOHS and other central and local government agencies to engage in a \nbroad hospital reform process needs to be strengthened. This will require a phased approach to \nhospital autonomy with built-in mechanisms to learn from the implementation process and \nreadjust implementation tools as required. Senior hospital management staff, board members, \nand selected community representatives will require substantial capacity upgrades if they are to \nlive up to their new responsibilities in managing autonomous facilities. The capacity of MOF to \noversee and monitor hospital financing reform will also need to be reinforced.  \n \n7.  ADB has supported government efforts to improve sector governance and strengthen \nhealth financing and health insurance under the Third Health Sector Development Project and \nthe  ongoing  TA  for  Strengthening  the  Health  Insurance  System,  which  resulted  in  a  high \nconsensus among stakeholders on key policy reforms in the health sector, including provider \nand purchaser split, autonomous status of providers, health insurance as a strong purchaser, \nand pooling of funds; and fair competition between public and private providers.10 The Third \nHealth Sector Development Project also assisted the government in identifying factors that \ninfluence  hospital  efficiency  (i.e.,  lack  of  flexibility  in  financial  management,  centralized \nprocurement, and high turnover of personnel) and supported the government in revising the \nHealth Law (2011).  \n \n8.  Based on this momentum, the government has requested ADB support to (i) further \nadvance the regulatory framework for hospital autonomy, (ii) build capacity of the government \nand hospital staff to manage hospitals within the improved legal environment, and (iii) provide \ntechnical support for the gradual implementation of hospital autonomy. \n                                                \n7  Government of Mongolia. 2012.

The impacts will be public hospitals\u2019 management performance improved, and autonomy \nof general and specialized hospitals in managing financial and human resources ensured. The \noutcome will be autonomy in pilot hospitals strengthened and decision to expand autonomy \nnationwide taken. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  An extensive review of international and national experiences will help in developing a \nconceptual framework and a strategic implementation plan for hospital autonomy based on \nextensive consultations with stakeholders. Readiness for implementation of hospital autonomy \nwill be ensured through intensive development of institutional and human resource capacity. A \nphased action plan for hospital autonomy will be implemented in five selected facilities. Hospital \nperformance will be monitored and evaluated, and lessons will serve for the formulation of policy \nrecommendations for further improvements of hospital autonomy. \n \n11.  Key activities of the TA will be organized under four outputs: \n(i)  Output  1:  Regulatory  environment  for  hospital  autonomy  analyzed  and \ndeveloped. This output will support MOHS in consulting with stakeholders on the \ndevelopment  of  a  conceptual  framework  and  a  strategic  plan  for  phased \nimplementation of hospital autonomy in Mongolia. This plan will be approved by \nthe cabinet. The framework will include ownership, governance, management \nfunctions,  financing,  human  resources,  and  social  responsibility  related  to \nregulations on running public hospitals as enterprises, and will be based on an \nanalysis of best international practices and careful selection of most suitable self-\ngoverning principles for Mongolia. Recommendations on policy and regulatory \nchanges to increase the performance of autonomous hospitals will be developed. \nThe activities of this output will follow a wide participatory approach, so a series \nof consultative and consensus-building meetings will be organized.  \n(ii)  Output 2: Institutional and human resource capacity for hospital autonomy \nstrengthened. This output will focus on strengthening institutional and human \nresource capacity based on a training needs assessment. Training programs for \nMOHS and other central and local government agencies will aim to strengthen \ntheir capacity for the new supervisory and regulatory tasks, while a series of \nmanagement  training  sessions  for  hospital  staff\u2014including  hospital  board \nmembers, directors, managers, and selected community representatives\u2014will \nfocus on exercising the delegated decision-making rights in the areas of finance, \nprocurement,  human  resources,  and  operational  management.  Training  will \nfollow a competency-based approach, which will include task analysis, defining \ntraining objectives, methodology, and development of training materials.  \n(iii)  Output 3: Hospital autonomy implementation piloted. This output will pilot-\ntest the implementation of the approved hospital autonomy framework. The pilot \nwill  be  carried  out  in  five  selected  hospitals,  including  secondary  (aimag \n[provincial]  and  district  general  hospitals)  and  tertiary  hospitals  (regional \ndiagnostic and treatment centers, and specialized hospitals). A time-bound action \nplan and monitoring and evaluation tool for hospital performance and operations \nwill  be  developed  for  each  of  the  selected  hospitals  to  enable  successful \nimplementation of autonomy in the pilot phase. The pilot implementation process \n ", "4   \nwill be supported by the proposed TA. Based on the lessons from implementing \nthe output, additional recommendations to improve the policy design and for full \nimplementation of the hospital autonomy framework will be provided. \n(iv)  Output 4: Public awareness on hospital autonomy increased. The TA will \ndevelop  a  plan  and  implement  an  advocacy  campaign  to  increase  public \nawareness on hospital autonomy with a specific focus on target groups. The TA \nwill  also  prepare  and  implement  a  plan  for  community  consultation  and \nparticipation to monitor the activities of hospitals selected for implementation of \nhospital autonomy. A knowledge product and policy recommendations based on \nimplementation results will be developed and disseminated at the end of project \nimplementation. \n \n12.  The key risk is that the priorities of the government change after the 2016 election, \nlessening its interest in hospital autonomy. The implementation of the TA could also be hindered \nif Parliament delays the passage of the Medical Care Act and other supporting laws. Finally, \ncentral government officials\u2019 resistance to hospital autonomy could be another risk. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000, of which $1,100,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of office accommodation for the project implementation unit (PIU) \nand other consultants, venues for meetings, counterpart staff and allowances, access to data, \nmiscellaneous administrative expenses, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  MOHS will be the executing agency of the TA and will designate a senior staff member \nas the TA focal point. MOHS will set up and chair a technical working group at the onset of TA \nimplementation  with  participation  of  all  key  stakeholders  (MOF,  Ulaanbaatar  City  Health \nDepartment,  Ministry  of  Population  Development  and  Social  Protection,  Social  Insurance \nGeneral Office, Mongolian Hospital Association, and consumer representatives). The TA will be \nimplemented over 24 months, tentatively from 1 April 2016 to 31 March 2018.   \n \n15.  In dialogue with MOHS, ADB will recruit a consulting firm using quality- and cost-based \nselection with a ratio of 90:10 and a simplified technical proposal to provide 21 person-months \nof international and 20 person-months of national consulting inputs, including experts in hospital \nautonomy, governance, health and hospital management, and capacity building. In addition, two \nnational consultants will be recruited individually to help develop and implement an advocacy \nplan and public campaign (2 person-months), and a community participation plan (4 person-\nmonths). A PIU will be set up to assist project implementation and day-to-day organizational and \ntechnical matters. A project coordinator (24 person-months) and an administration and finance \ncoordinator (27 person-months), who will be part of the PIU, will be recruited as individual \nconsultants by ADB and paid from TA funds. The consulting firm, national individual consultants, \nand coordinators will be hired in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). The terms of reference (Appendix 3) outline their tasks \nand reporting requirements. \n \n16.  The PIU will be responsible for procuring the office equipment under the supervision of \nMOHS in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to \ntime). MOHS will retain the equipment upon TA completion. TA funds will be disbursed in \n ", "  5 \naccordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). To assist implementation, ADB may establish an advance payment facility for the \nexecuting agency to support certain agreed cash expenditures, including workshops, training, \nseminars and conferences, and implementation of field work and survey activities, with details of \nthe proposed activities, including cost estimates, submitted through the executing agency to \nADB for approval. ADB may also make certain direct payments (e.g., for workshop venues). \n \n17.  TA achievements will be disseminated to policymakers, the private sector, civil society, \nand the media, for instance by means of workshops, publications, and through the local media. \nAdvocacy activities and a plan for community consultation and participation to support hospital \nautonomy will be implemented. A final conference, with the participation of all stakeholders will \nbe  held  and  a  knowledge  product  (policy  brief)  will  be  prepared  to  capture  the  policy \nrecommendations for the government resulting from hospital autonomy implementation. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,100,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Mongolia for Strengthening Hospital Autonomy, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n Impacts the TA is Aligned with \nPublic hospitals\u2019 management performance improved (The Implementation Framework of the Health \nSector Strategic Master Plan, 2006\u20132015)a \n \nAutonomy of general and specialized hospitals in managing financial and human resources ensured \n(The Government Action Plan, 2012\u20132016)b  \n   Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  a.
