ADB also supports \nthe main principle of universal access in the Okinawa Charter1\u2014that everyone should be able to \nparticipate  in,  and  no  one  should  be  excluded  from,  the  benefits  of  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT). The Pacific developing member country (PDMC) leaders are \naware of the critical importance of ICT and regional cooperation, and they envisage2 \u201ca regional \ncommunity  in  which  the  processes  of  work,  commerce,  learning,  social  interaction,  and \ngovernment  are  facilitated  and  enhanced  by  ICT,  enabling  all  citizens  to  take  part  in \nopportunities brought by the global information economy.\u201d \n \n2.  Electronic rural (e-rural) is a term that describes the use of ICT to promote a more \nefficient and cost-effective rural sector, facilitate more convenient services to isolated rural \nareas, allow greater access to information (especially on markets), facilitate social inclusion, and \nmake rural sector policies and activities more transparent and accountable. In January 2004, \nthe Fact-Finding Mission for regional technical assistance (TA) for E-Rural Demonstration in the \nPacific visited Honolulu3 and the Fiji Islands. An understanding was reached on the TA purpose, \nkey activities, consultants\u2019 terms of reference, cost estimates and financing, and implementation \narrangements.4 The TA framework is given in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  PDMCs are vulnerable to natural disasters, most have few resources, almost all are \nremote, and many have insufficient population to benefit from economies of scale.5 Poverty in \nthe Pacific is not about lack of food. It is mainly the lack of income opportunities and access to \nbasic services such as health and education that are highly information-based or information \nrich.6 \u201cThe nature and causes of poverty are complex and multidimensional. The most critical \nfactor in breaking the cycle of poverty is empowerment that comes from access to information \nand knowledge.\u201d7  \n \n4.  The main challenge for PDMC governments is to deliver basic social services in rural \nareas. Here ICT can play a pivotal role. ICT costs are decreasing and performances are \nincreasing  dramatically.  Furthermore,  ICT  is  scalable,  i.e.,  its  use  can  develop  with  the \nincreasing purchasing power of the users.8  \n \n5.  In  May  2003,  ADB  approved  TA  6107-REG:  Preparing  a  Pro-Poor  Subregional  E-\nGovernment Project for Providing Basic Service Delivery to Remote Communities in the Pacific. \nThe objective is to assist PDMCs in assessing their e-government needs or demands and \nimplementation capacity, mainly with reference to basic social service delivery to remote and \ndisadvantaged communities. The TA will also identify and formulate a regional pro-poor e-\n                                                 \n1  Global Information Society. 2000.

Among the findings of TA 6107 is that, for implementing e-government services, the \nwidespread availability of Internet access offers considerable potential for improved low-cost \ncommunication  technologies,  such  as  e-mail,  voice-over-Internet-protocol  (VOIP)  telephony, \nand file transfer. However, remote locations falling outside the revenue areas of commercial \nproviders traditionally have difficulties with such communication; last-mile solutions have been a \nproblem even in countries with otherwise adequate urban access capacity as in Fiji Islands, \nPapua New Guinea, and Samoa. Land and maritime transport are increasingly difficult and \nexpensive,  and  are  insufficient  ways  of  accessing  essential  information  or  services.  Rural \nvillages are forced to look for more cost-effective and reliable methods of communication, not \nonly in normal circumstances, but also in life-threatening situations such as natural disasters. \nThe feasibility of using e-mail and VOIP as primary sources of communication is now viable. \nResearch done for TA 6107, which aimed at providing e-government and social services, has \nidentified two major impediments to providing such communication technology to remote areas: \nthe expense of repairs and maintenance (which is related to cost recovery), and the regulatory \nenvironment. \n \n7.  ICT is becoming more and more reliable and affordable. Communication satellites cover \nthe whole Pacific area. The least-cost solution to provide Internet access to remote rural areas \nwould be a multiple-access very small aperture terminal network made up by a control station \n(the hub) broadcasting the signal to the satellite and down to each point of presence (POP). \nMultiple access technology allows each POP to receive a share of the total bandwidth available \nat the satellite, thus minimizing operating costs. The hub is connected to a data backbone, \nallowing  each  POP  to  connect  to  the  Internet  and  use  any  Internet-protocol  (IP)-based \napplication such as e-mail, web, or voice. A single hub can manage thousands of POPs. \nMoreover,  the  reach  of  connectivity  could  be  expanded  locally  around  the  POPs  through \nwireless local loop (WLL) to reach buildings and nearby users.9 While the hub is expensive, it \ncan handle transmissions from a large number of POPs which are relatively inexpensive;10 \nconsequently, there are potential economies of scale to gain by maximizing the number of \nPOPs feeding through a single hub. In this regard, the ideal system for the Pacific would be a \nvery small aperture terminal network covering several countries with the POPs in each of the \ncountries feeding through a single hub.11 \n \n8.  The impact of ICT in remote areas of several developing countries has transformed need \ninto demand.12 The rapid technological advances in ICT have been mirrored by an equally \ndramatic  reduction  in  costs.  This  combination  of  improved  technology  and  lower  costs  is \nconducive to e-rural development.  \n \n9.  There are  several success stories worldwide  in providing e-government services to \nremote  communities,  each  with  its  business  cost  recovery  or  sustainability  model.  The \n                                                 \n9 This solution is used by the National Informatics Center in India. It now has more than 2,200 national POPs, many \nof which serve nearby centers. For more information, see URL http://home.nic.in/htm/nicnet.htm. \n10 A hub costs approximately $1 million. A POP can cost as little as $1,000. The operational cost is directly related to \nthe total number of POPs and the cost of the bandwidth (space segment) they share.  \n11 The cost of leasing space segments from a satellite-based service provider is declining, but the cost is still beyond \nmost remote communities' ability to pay. More POPs can have better negotiation capacity with the service \nproviders. In fact, due to the significant economies of scale (footnote 10) with a sufficient number of POPs, the \nindividual cost per POP can decrease from a hundred dollars to a few dollars. With more than 300-400 POPs, the \nunit cost of a 24-hour connection can decrease to less than $2 per POP per day. \n12 Demand is ability and willingness to pay to satisfy a need. \n ", "    3\nGovernment of Egypt has established a network of 700 \u201cInformation Technology Clubs,\u201d seen \nas information distribution outlets for e-government-based services.13 In Ukraine, the financial \ncost-recovery model developed allows entrepreneurs to open telecenters in rural schools where \nthe entrepreneurs can operate the centers commercially outside school hours. In Kerala, India, \nthe Keltron Information Kiosks provide public access to the Internet and e-government services \nthrough public-private partnership. In Bangladesh, the Grameen Cyber Society uses ICT to \nprovide rural community women with primary education and additional skills development.14  \n \n10.  Improved ICT effectiveness has reached a point where it is now feasible to use ICT in \nremote  rural  locations  throughout  the  Pacific.15  In  the  Pacific  region,  however,  the \nappropriateness, effectiveness, and sustainability of delivering basic social services to remote \ncommunities through ICT are largely undemonstrated.16 This regional TA will complement the \nongoing TA 6107, which is preparing the feasibility study for a possible regional e-rural loan. \nThis regional TA and the proposed project are preparatory for the loan and support each other. \nThe first phase of TA 6107 has confirmed that to prepare the loan, there is a need for an e-rural \ndemonstration in the region.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The goal of this TA is to improve the enabling environment for economic growth and \npoverty reduction in rural areas in the Pacific by improving access to basic communication. The \npurpose is to demonstrate the use and effectiveness of ICT solutions to reduce isolation in \nremote rural locations in the Pacific by improving access to basic communication and, through \nit, provide the opportunity to enhance governance, health, education, social inclusion, and \ndisaster mitigation and alleviation. The TA will produce a final workshop and a comprehensive \nfinal  report  on  the  potential  application  of  ICT  to  provide  affordable  information  and \ncommunication access for and to remoter communities in the Pacific. The main outputs follow: \n \n(i)  Demonstrator locations identified and selected. Based on the findings of TA \n6107 and written expressions of interest from representatives of each country \ninvolved, at least two suitable demonstration locations will be identified. Each \nlocation will include at least one urban and one representative rural POP. \n \n(ii)  E-rural system(s) installed. In collaboration with the main stakeholders, an \neasy-maintenance, low-power POP\u2014and a WLL if applicable\u2014will be installed in \neach selected location on a time-limited trial basis. \n \n(iii)  E-rural applications implemented. To promote rapid uptake and expanded \nusage  of  the  demonstration  sites,  the  TA  will  assist  in  identifying  and \nimplementing potential applications, such as the submission of periodic reports \n                                                 \n13 See web site http://www.egypt.gov.eg/english/services/ \n14 See web site http://www.grameentelecenter.org. \n15 In the Pacific region, the demand (as well as the population) is more limited and dispersed, making e-rural services \nless viable and sustainable. \n16 A success story in providing information access to rural communities in the Pacific is the People First Network \n(PFnet) in Solomon Islands (it will be soon replicated in Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea-Bougainville). PFnet, \nestablished in 2001, uses HF (SW) band wireless radio technology. The solution has high start-up costs and works \nexclusively  point-to-point.  However,  connectivity  (recurring)  costs  are  minimal  at  the  expense  of  bandwidth \navailability, limited to ~ 2 kbps. See web site www.peoplefirst.net.sb. \n ", "4  \nby government and nongovernment agencies, the transfer of data and files, and \nthe use of e-mail and VOIP for official and non official communications. \n \n(iv)  Business and management model(s) developed. The TA will evaluate interest \nin and the commercial feasibility of providing user-paid public access to the \nsystem through local communities, churches, utilities, and businesses. The TA \nwill also review the need for standard back-office policies in the demonstration \nsites, such as conditions of use, payment for services, access management, \netc.17 \n \n(v)  Knowledge-sharing platform established. Demonstrations of usability, cost, \nand overall functionality of the system will be offered to decision makers and \nregulators  for  their  information  and  understanding.  To  facilitate  subsequent \nimplementation  of  the  e-rural  network,  the  TA  will  establish  a  platform  for \nknowledge-sharing, lesson learning, and mentoring across the network, based on \na technical web site, frequently asked questions, and a panel of experts. \n \n(vi)  Capacity created and monitoring program implemented. The TA will assist in \nevaluating the institutional capacity of the recipient locations. Moreover, the TA \nwill design and implement a capacity-building and monitoring program to ensure \nappropriate use of the technology being demonstrated, content management, \nand monitoring of the resulting activities. \n \n(vii)  Lessons learned and recommendations shared with the stakeholders. The \nTA will produce a comprehensive report and a final workshop to present to and \ndiscuss with the stakeholders the lessons learned from the e-rural demonstration. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will build on the findings, achievements, and interest generated through TA \n6107.  The  TA  activities  will  include,  but  will  not  be  limited  to  (i)  reviewing  candidate \ndemonstrator locations and identifying at least two remote locations [para. 11(i)] to demonstrate \nthe  proposed  information  distribution  technology;  (ii)  installing  and  testing  the  POPs  and \nassociated equipment, e.g., with at least one computer per location, and connection to or \ninstallation of the power supply system in the selected demonstrator locations; (iii) providing \ntemporary connection for at least one site through a POP, via WLL, to major users in the area, \nincluding schools or health centers; (iv) providing temporary connection (between 6 and 8 \nmonths)  of  the  POPs  to  a  satellite  data  service;  (v)  identifying  potential  applications  and \nsupporting their implementation; (vi) developing back-office and site management functionality; \n(vii) operation and maintenance, i.e., training the operator and building capacity in the local \ncommunity;18 (viii) establishing mechanisms for future information-sharing and mentoring; (ix) \nmonitoring the system and identifying lessons to be learned, thereby improving the sustainability \nof the system and its suitability for replication at other sites; and (x) holding of a final TA \n                                                 \n17 There is not one-fits-all e-rural business model (para. 9). Furthermore, the Pacific region is not homogeneous. The \nlocation-specific business model has to be identified in a participatory manner in terms of local geographic, \nhistorical,  demographic,  social,  and  economic  specificities,  including  the  presence  of  local  champions  and \ncoordinators, including women, who can empathize with the users. \n18 The local operators are location-specific. In some countries and locations, the local councils have the capacity to \nproperly manage the proposed system. In others, private operators (e.g., shops or small tourist resorts) or other \nnonstate actors (e.g., churches or women groups) could be more effective. \n ", "    5\nworkshop and producing a comprehensive final report on this e-rural demonstration in the \nPacific.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $230,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB's TA funding program. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Pacific Department will execute the TA. A national implementing agency (IA) will \nassist with implementation activities in each participating PDMC. \n \n15.  ADB will engage 11 person-months consulting services (3 person-months international, \nand  8  person-months  domestic,  on  an  individual  basis)  from  consultants  with  relevant \nexperience in all aspects of the specified scope of work. The TA will require 2 person-months of \na principal ICT international consultant, 1 person-month of international short-term consultants, \nand 8 person-months of domestic consultants. The TA will also require short-term visits to \nmonitor the use of the ICT demonstration units. The individual consultants will be engaged in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The international consultants will have \nexpertise in technical and project planning for ICT, consulting with a variety of stakeholders, and \nimplementing strategies. The domestic consultants will have expertise in ICT and social and \ncommunity development, with emphasis on participation and monitoring, and project monitoring \nand evaluation. The detailed terms of reference is in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over a period of about 9 months. It is expected to begin in \nOctober 2004 and to be completed by June 2005. Within 4 weeks after the TA starts, the team \nleader will submit a brief inception report summarizing the initial findings, identifying specific \nissues, and suggesting changes to the methodology and program, if any. Within 8 months after \nthe TA starts, the team leader will submit a draft final report for comments by ADB and IAs. \nSubsequently, the team leader will make all the recommended changes and submit the final \nreport within 9 months after the TA starts. The TA will produce design and analytical results that \nfully comply with all relevant ADB policies. The team leader will submit three copies of all \nreports to ADB and six copies to IAs in both hard copy and electronic files.19 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.
