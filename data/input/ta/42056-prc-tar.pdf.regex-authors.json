During  the  2007  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested technical assistance (TA) from Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to assist with the design and implementation of a national sulfur dioxide (SO ) trading \n2\nsystem. The TA concept paper was approved on 2 April 2008, and a reconnaissance mission \nwas fielded on 12 March 2008.1 A Fact-Finding mission was held from 26\u201330 May 2008, and it \nresulted in an agreement with the Government on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements, and financing plan of the TA project. The TA project design and monitoring \nframework are in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Economic growth in the PRC has averaged more than 9.5% annually for the past two \ndecades. Growth in the PRC now accounts for about 15% of global economic growth, up from \n3% in 1980. By 2010, the economy is expected to double from its 2000 level, and is expected to \nquadruple by 2020. Energy demand has grown in parallel with the growing economy. Since \n2000, annual electricity consumption growth has averaged about 13%. The current growth in \npower generation capacity is unprecedented; installed generation capacity has increased at an \nannual average of more than 8% over the past two decades. In both 2006 and 2007, 105 \ngigawatts (GW) of new capacity were installed in each year. These increases represented a \nrecord annual increase for any country (one year capacity addition alone is equivalent to the \nentire installed capacity of Africa). As the economy grows further, it is anticipated that electricity \ndemand will continue to grow rapidly. Currently, energy demand in the PRC is the second \nhighest in the world, and is projected to overtake the leader, the United States (US), by 2011. It \nis projected that the PRC will account for 20% of global energy demand by 2030.2 Annual per \ncapita electricity consumption has risen dramatically in recent decades, from 340 kilowatt-hours \n(kWh) in 1983 to 1,840 kWh in 2005. As per capita income continues to rise, consumption is \nalso expected to increase.  \n \n3.  The PRC energy sector is heavily dependent on coal; approximately 69% of the PRC's \nprimary energy supply is from coal, and 82% of electricity is generated from coal. The PRC is \nwell endowed with coal; it has the third largest proven coal reserves in the world. It is the world\u2019s \nlargest coal producer as well as the largest consumer. Coal production accounted for 38% of \nglobal production in 2005; this figure is projected to increase to 49% by 2030. Coal demand \nincreased from 446 million tons of coal equivalent (Mtce) in 1980 to 1,563 Mtce in 2005, and is \nprojected to increase to 3,462 Mtce by 2030. It is expected that the PRC will remain heavily \ndependent on coal for power generation for the foreseeable future. Emissions from coal-fired \npower generation, particularly SO  and oxides of nitrogen (NO ) are a significant contributor to \n2 x\nair pollution and the primary cause of acid rain. Approximately 48% of cities fail to meet the \nnational air quality standards.3 Acid deposition causes deterioration in public health, reduced \nagricultural productivity, damage to infrastructure, and ecosystem degradation. Coal-fired power \ngeneration accounts for about 52% of the nation\u2019s SO  emissions (2005). Acid rain falls on one-\n2\nthird of the country and is estimated to annually cause $4 billion in crop damage and $0.9 billion \nin material damage (footnote 3).  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 April 2008. \n2  International Energy Agency. 2007. World Energy Outlook. Paris Cedex 15, France. \n3  World Bank. 2007. Cost of Pollution in China: Economic Estimates of Physical Damage, Conference Edition. \nWashington, DC. \n ", "2   \n \n4.  SO   emissions  in  the  PRC  gradually  decreased  throughout  the  1990\u2019s,  primarily \n2\nattributed to (i) Government policies mandating the use of low-sulfur coal in power generation, (ii) \nprograms resulting in the closure of small boilers, and (iii) slower electricity demand growth as a \nresult of the 1997 financial crisis. However, unprecedented growth in the energy sector since \n2002 has led to steadily increasing SO  emissions. The 10th Five Year Plan (2000\u20132005) \n2\ntargeted an SO  emission reduction of 10%; instead, emissions increased by 27%, primarily \n2\nbecause of a 64% expansion in coal-fired generation capacity. In 2005, total SO  emissions in \n2\nthe PRC were 25.9 million tons, the highest in the world. \n \n5.  In response, the Government has introduced a number of measures to reduce SO  \n2\nemissions, including (i) mandating installation of flue gas desulfurization units in power plants; \n(ii) closing  small,  inefficient  boilers;  (iii)  strengthening  regulations  regarding  coal  washing; \n(iv) requiring increased use of low-sulfur coal; and (v) introducing total emission control policies. \nAs of 2000, only 2% (5 GW) of thermal generation capacity had flue gas desulfurization units \ninstalled. By the end of 2007, this percentage had increased to 48.7% (270 GW), and it is \nprojected to increase to 60% by 2010. Power generation in the PRC has historically been \ndominated by small, inefficient generating units, which tend to lack sophisticated emission-\ncontrol equipment. In 2005, 29.4% of installed capacity was from units less than 100 MW, \nhowever, this share is expected to decrease due to (i) mandated policies on closing small \nboilers (25 GW were decommissioned in 2006 and 2007), and (ii) dominance of larger units for \nnew installations. The 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) has established a mandatory SO  \n2\nemission reduction target of 10%. Reaching this target will be a major challenge, as generation \ncapacity is projected to increase by 45% during the same period. In 2006 emissions increased \n1.7%, to 25.94 million tons; however, in 2007 emissions decreased by 6.6%, to 24.23 million \ntons.4 To encourage sustainable reductions in SO  emissions, the Government is proposing that \n2\na  market-based  SO   trading  system  be  utilized  to  complement  command-and-control \n2\ninstruments.  \n \n6.  The introduction of an SO  trading system provides a market-based mechanism to \n2\nmanage SO  emissions at the least economic cost. The Government sets a national emissions \n2\ncap, then establishes an emission trading platform based on emission allowances allocated to \nSO  emitters. Emission sources with excess reductions can then trade their allowances. The \n2\ntrading system operates to identify least-cost emission reductions. This cap-and-trade system \ncomplements existing policy initiatives to reduce SO  emissions.  \n2\n \n7.  The PRC is a suitable country for establishing a national SO  trading system because \n2\n(i) emissions  from  readily  monitorable  point  sources  (i.e.,  power  plant  stacks)  constitute  a \nrelatively high percentage of total emissions, (ii) there is a wide range of marginal control costs \nbetween emission sources, (iii) the Government has shown a strong commitment to controlling \nSO  emissions, and (iv) important lessons have been learned through a number of pilot SO  \n2 2\ntrading projects. SO  trading has been successfully introduced internationally, notably in the US, \n2\nwhere it was introduced by the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) under the Acid \nRain Program. The US experience confirms that SO  trading can be an effective market-based \n2\nmechanism that efficiently allocates resources to lower the overall cost of system compliance. \nThe USEPA estimates that SO  trading has reduced the cost of compliance with the SO  \n2 2\nemissions cap from $7 billion\u2013$9 billion to $1 billion\u2013$1.5 billion per year. \n \n                                                 \n4  Ministry of Environmental Protection. 2008. China Environmental Statistics. Beijing. ", "  3\n8.  However, there are a number of barriers to the successful implementation of an SO  \n2\ntrading system, including (i) a lack of established trading platforms (i.e., emissions trading \nsystem and allowance tracking systems); (ii) a relatively low level of installation of continuous \nemission monitoring equipment on power plant emission stacks, resulting in relatively poor-\nquality compliance data; (iii) inconsistent reporting formats from power plants, (iv) difficulties \nwith emission verification and compliance; and (v) large variations in implementation capacities \nat the provincial government and power plant levels. \n \n9.  The promotion of SO  trading aligns closely with the Government\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan \n2\ntarget  of  reducing  SO   emissions.  Support  for  establishing  an  SO   trading  system  is  also \n2 2\nconsistent with ADB's (i) long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020) priority of  \n\u201cenvironmentally sustainable growth\u201d,5 and (ii) PRC country partnership strategy (2008\u20132010) \nstrategic pillar of \u201cresource efficiency and environmental sustainability\u201d.6 ADB has been actively \nsupporting SO  emission reduction in the PRC. In 2004, ADB supported one of the first pilot \n2\nprojects of an SO  trading scheme in Taiyuan City.7 ADB also extended a loan for Anhui \n2\nProvince8 that targeted industrial retrofits to reduce SO  emissions. ADB currently has six \n2\nongoing loans in the PRC energy sector, resulting in an annual reduction of 66,000 tons SO  \n2\nwhen the projects become fully operational.  \n \n10.  Pilot SO  trading projects at the city and provincial levels in the PRC have provided \n2\nvaluable  lessons  for  developing  a  national  trading  scheme.  The  pilot  project  in  Taiyuan \ndemonstrated the need for establishing a robust regulatory framework prior to implementation of \nthe trading scheme, and for allowing sufficient time to test the emission trading and tracking \nsoftware.  The  pilot  projects  have  also  clearly  demonstrated  the  necessity  for  transparent \nemission reporting guidelines to allow emitters to gauge potential impacts to business, and the \nnecessity for a high degree of support from provincial and local governments. The PRC has a \nTotal Emissions Control program that specifies a national SO  emission target and allocates \n2\ntargets to provincial and municipal levels. Once the trading platform is available, regulations will \nbe issued by the Government to require emitters to meet the target through the cap-and-trade \nsystem. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact of the TA will be improved environmental conditions through reduced SO  \n2\nemissions, and the outcome will be the establishment of a national SO  trading system.  \n2\n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2008.

Component 1: Emission Tracking System and Allowance Tracking System \n \n13.  Component 1 will assist the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) to develop the \nSO   trading  system  by  establishing  an  emission  tracking  system  (ETS)  and  an  allowance \n2\ntracking system (ATS). The ETS is an electronic reporting system that collects, reviews, and \nmanages emission data from emission sources. The ATS is a separate electronic reporting \nsystem that collects, validates, and manages emission allowance transactions undertaken by \nemission sources. Data from both the ETS (tracking source emissions) and the ATS (tracking \ntrade of allowances) are required for operation and compliance monitoring of the emission \ntrading  system.  It  will  include  (i)  development  of  operational  manuals;  (ii)  development  of \nrelevant ETS and ATS software suitable for use in the PRC, based on existing software used for \nthe US SO  trading system; (iii) training of relevant officials in the operation of ETS and ATS \n2\nsoftware; and (iv) pilot testing of ETS and ATS software on selected power plants. The manuals \nand software developed will complement the existing regulatory framework. \n \n  2.   Component 2: Emission Monitoring, Verification, and Reporting Standards \n \n14.  An  emissions  trading  system  requires  clear  and  practical  compliance  guidelines  to \nensure consistency in implementation and equitable distribution of emission allowances. To \nsupport implementation of the emissions trading system, component 2 will support the drafting \nof power plant emission monitoring, verification, and reporting standards for the SO  trading \n2\nsystem, including but not limited to (i) monitoring-equipment requirements; (ii) requirements for \ninstallation  and  maintenance  of  monitoring  equipment;  (iii)  procedures  for  stack-emission \nmonitoring; and (iv) procedures for recording, storing, and reporting emissions data.  \n \n  3.   Component 3: Capacity Development and Information Dissemination \n \n15.  Component 3 will consist of a series of workshops held in three regional centers to build \ncapacity and increase awareness of the newly developed proposed SO  trading system. The \n2\nworkshops will target staff from the local environment protection bureaus (EPBs) and power \ngenerating companies. The workshops will enhance the understanding of the objectives and \nbenefits  of  the  proposed  system,  and  will  discuss  the  details  of  the  system's  operations, \nstakeholder responsibilities, trading procedures and principles, and proposed implementation \nschedule. The workshops will also provide a venue for the local EPBs to learn about the \nexperiences of the SO  trading system in the pilot trading centers. \n2\n \n16.  The main deliverables from the TA will be (i) an SO  trading system consisting of ETS \n2\nand ATS software; (ii) operational manuals for the SO  trading system; (iii) SO  emission \n2 2\nmonitoring,  verification,  and  reporting  standards;  and  (iv)  three  information  dissemination \nworkshops. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $700,000, of which $500,000 will be financed by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. Counterpart financing will consist of in-kind contributions equivalent ", "  5\nto $200,000 in the form of office space, facilities, and salaries of counterpart staff. Details of the \ncost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over a 1-year period from January 2009 to January 2010. \nThe MEP will be the Executing Agency for the Project. International and national consultants will \nbe  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The consultants\u2019 services will be provided through a consulting firm \nselected after the submission of simplified technical proposals and the use of quality- and cost-\nbased  selection  methods  (quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20).  Software  design  companies  for \ndevelopment of the ETS and ATS software will be provided through consultants\u2019 qualifications \nselection; the selection criteria will include the ability to extend continuing service for debugging \nand updating the software during the initial years of the implementation of the national SO  \n2\ntrading system. \n \n19.  Equipment  will  be  financed  under  the  TA  and  will  be  procured  by  international \nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). This equipment will be handed over to the Executing Agency upon completion of the TA \nproject. Coordination among the consultants will be managed by the Executing Agency through \nthe Foreign Economic Cooperation Office (FECO), which will act as the project management \noffice.  The  estimated  allocation  of  consulting  services  will  be  2  international  consultants \n(combined 4 person-months), and 4 national consultants (combined 24 person-months). The \ninternational consultants will consist of (i) an SO  trading specialist, and (ii) an emissions \n2\nmonitoring specialist. The national consultants will consist of (i) a senior SO  trading specialist, \n2\n(ii) an SO  trading specialist, and (iii) two emission monitoring specialists. The USEPA will \n2\nprovide implementation support for component 1 and component 2.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.
