INTRODUCTION \n1.  In the past 20 years, the governments of Central and West Asia (CWA) have carried out \nsignificant educational reforms to align their education systems to the needs of their changing \neconomies and help them integrate into the global economy. Despite their achievements, CWA \ncountries face challenges in boosting their global and regional competitiveness. A report from \nthe  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  showed  that \nunderdeveloped education and training systems represent one of the three major challenges to \nimproving competitiveness in these economies.1 Some CWA countries are at the middle-income \nlevel.  If  they  are  to  maintain  their  growth  rates,  they  need  to  become  knowledge-based \neconomies, diversify, innovate, and develop manufacturing and services.  \n \n2.  The governments of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan have requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) to \nsupport sector assessment and capacity building in education and skills development, in order \nto enhance the countries\u2019 competitiveness. This regional capacity building TA grant of $1.0 \nmillion has been designed in response to these needs and to the Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020.2 The TA will also support ADB\u2019s policy dialogue on the education sector in this subregion. \nThe TA impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost estimates and financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for initial consultants were agreed with the respective \ngovernments during TA fact-finding in September-October 2014. 3 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Since  1991,  ADB\u2019s  developing member  countries  (DMCs)  in the  CWA  region  have \nundertaken a range of economic and social reforms to support their transition to a market \neconomy. While the existing human capital base in most CWA countries has a number of \nstrengths, such as high literacy rates and high primary enrollment rates, challenges remain. \nThese include skills shortages, reliance on imported labor in some countries and significant \noutmigration for work in other countries, unemployment, and underdeveloped research and \ninnovation capacity. As a result, these DMCs are less competitive. In secondary education, key \nchallenges  include  low  public  spending  per  student;  low  quality  of  education;  rural\u2013urban \ndisparities in learning outcomes; a shortage of qualified teachers (especially in rural areas); and \nsignificant drop-out, repetition, and non-attendance rates. While governments have pursued \neducation sector reforms, these changes have not led to a better quality of education, as \nreflected in the performance of some CWA countries in international student achievement tests. \nAs  an  example,  Azerbaijan  ranked  64th  among  65  countries  that  participated  in  OECD\u2019s \nProgram of International Student Achievement in 2009.  \n \n4.  A number of policy areas need attention, such as modernizing the curriculum, textbooks, \nand  teaching  materials;  improving  student  assessment,  teacher  training,  and  school-based \nmanagement; strengthening governance and financing; improving results orientation in policy \nplanning; and monitoring and evaluating sector performance. In Armenia, university entrants \nhave tended to choose academic programs in humanities and social sciences, rather than \nscience, technology, engineering, and math, leading to skills shortages.  Countries need to \nstrengthen career guidance in secondary education to encourage students to enroll in science, \n                                                \n1  OECD.  2011.

Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 5 September 2014. \n ", "2   \ntechnology, engineering, and math programs. Azerbaijan is shifting to a 12-year school system \nto align it with international standards, and this requires significant reforms and a phased rollout \nof  the  changes.  In  Uzbekistan,  the  role  of  information  and  communication  technology  in \neducation is being increasingly emphasized, and teacher competencies in this area need to be \nstrengthened. \n \n5.  Although  many  CWA  countries  have  started  improving  technical  and  vocational \neducation and training (TVET) systems, the challenges that remain are considerable. Given the \nskills shortages in most CWA economies, better skills diagnostics are required to meet current \njob requirements, anticipate future demands for labor, and improve competitiveness. TVET \nsystems need to be modernized to identify and meet market demand by developing closer \npartnerships with the private sector. Countries need a more systematic approach to evidence-\nbased policy making, including the regular conduct of tracer studies of TVET graduates and \nemployer  surveys,  and  development  of  quality  assurance  and  qualifications  systems. \nStrengthening TVET systems, combined with labor market policies, provision of employment \nservices, and entrepreneurship training, can contribute to a decrease in youth unemployment \nand improvements in national competitiveness and productivity. Gender aspects of education, \ntraining,  and  labor  market  outcomes  are  also  a  key  crosscutting  issue  in  this  subregion. \nArmenia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan have achieved gender parity in secondary education. \nHowever, educational choices at the postsecondary level and labor market outcomes exhibit \ngendered patterns, with women overrepresented in humanities and social science programs \nand in lower-paying public sector jobs (health and education), and men dominating in technical \nfields of study and in higher-paying jobs, including manufacturing, computer sciences, and \nconstruction. Changes need to be made so as to improve women\u2019s employability and salaries. \n \n6.  Lack of capacity in the government limits opportunities to improve education systems. To \nharness human capital, education leaders in CWA countries need to promote policies that \naddress  relevance,  quality,  access,  and  equity,  and  improve  education\u2019s  link  to  economic \ndevelopment and labor market needs. CWA countries can also benefit from capacity building in \neducation sector evidence-based policy making, research, and knowledge approaches.  \n \n7.  In  the  past,  ADB  has  supported  education  sector  development  in  selected  CWA \ncountries. Given the persistent challenges in education and skills development, and the growing \nrelevance  of  and  demand for  ADB  assistance  in  education  advisory  support  and  capacity \nbuilding, the TA has been designed to respond flexibly to individual country needs. Using an \nincremental approach to engagement with CWA countries in the education sector, the TA \nfocuses on three CWA countries\u2014Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan.4 These countries were \nselected based on their specific request for TA support in the education sector.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA impact will be improved education and skills development systems aligned to \nemployment requirements in Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan. Performance indicators for \n2022 include (i) an increase of 10% in the number of skilled employees entering the workforce; \nand (ii) an increase in employer satisfaction with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of new \nemployees. The outcome of the TA will be the increased knowledge and capacity of Armenia, \n                                                \n4  A  no-objection  in  writing  will  be  obtained  from  the  governments  of  the  participating  countries  before  the \ncommencing or financing of proposed activities in the participating countries. \n ", "  3 \nAzerbaijan, and Uzbekistan to adopt appropriate policies and investments for education and \nskills development. The performance indicator is updated national education and TVET sector \nplans, reflecting the strengthened analytical and planning capacities of government agencies \ninvolved in education and skills development.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Output 1: Thematic analytical studies and knowledge products completed. The TA \nwill support studies in two priority subsectors in the three participating countries. Under output 1, \neach country will select from these two subsectors a total of three topics for assessment on the \nbasis of specific country needs. The first subsector is \u201cAchieving Education Quality,\" with a \nfocus on the quality, access, equity, and relevance of basic and secondary education. The \ntopics  may  include  the  following:  (i)  educational  management;  (ii)  cost  effectiveness  and \nefficiency of education financing; (iii) results-based planning and effectiveness of the education \nmanagement information systems; (iv) pre-service and in-service teacher training; (v) teacher \ncertification;  (vi)  curriculum  reform  and  provision  of  learning  and  teaching  materials;  (vii) \nassessing learning outcomes; (viii) information and communication technology for education, \nincluding teacher training, affordability, and use in the classroom; (ix) teaching of science, \ntechnology,  engineering,  and  math;  (x)  fostering  non-cognitive  skills  in  students;  and  (xi) \naccreditation, inspection, supervision, and monitoring of progress in educational institutions.  \n \n10.  The second subsector is \u201cModernizing Vocational Education,\u201d which may include the \nfollowing topics: (i) integration of TVET, labor market policies, and employment services for \nyouth  and  adults;  (ii)  industry  involvement,  occupational  standards,  national  qualifications \nframeworks, entrepreneurship, and enterprise-based training; (iii) skills demand mapping and \nforecasting; (iv) inclusive growth and skills development for disadvantaged groups, including \nshort-term and informal training; (v)  addressing demand for skilled workers in the growing \nsectors, including extractive industries; (vi) TVET governance, management, and coordination; \n(vii) regional cooperation and skills development, including assessing regional demand for a \nskilled  workforce;  balancing  the  regional  and  national  demand  for  and  supply  of  skills; \ndeveloping methods for reducing the risks of a mismatch; and developing regional indicators \nand benchmarks related to relevance, equity, and efficiency in reorganizing and optimizing \nTVET  systems;  (viii)  public\u2013private  partnerships  in  education  and  innovative  financing \nmechanisms; (ix) information and communication technology for TVET, including online and \ndistance learning; and (x) training programs to support low-carbon and green growth. \n \n11.  An initial desk review will be conducted for the three priority topics selected by each \nparticipating country. This review will include the governments\u2019 education sector development \nstrategies;  success  factors  and  lessons  from  ADB  and  other  development  partner-funded \nprojects  in  CWA  countries;  capacity-building  programs  provided  by  ADB  and  other \norganizations; employer, labor market, and household surveys; a review of impact evaluation \nstudies  related  to  education  and TVET, gender  assessments,  and  other  relevant material. \nSurveys and focus group discussions will include gender dimensions. The desk review will be \nfollowed by a visit to each participating country to meet with key stakeholders, including policy \nmakers and private sector and industry representatives, to validate the desk review findings. \nThis consultation will help to clarify constraints to improvement in the education and skills \ndevelopment  sector,  including  capacity  gaps  and  critical  strategic  issues,  and  to  identify \ninnovative areas where ADB can provide support.  \n \n12.  The TA will support the preparation of working papers and knowledge products that \nreflect the thematic issues and common concerns identified through the studies. The knowledge \n ", "4   \nproducts will focus on good practice and innovative solutions. They will be disseminated to \nrelevant government agencies, educational institutions, and other stakeholders, and will be \ndiscussed in workshops and seminars. Assistance from ADB to support the development of \nspecific education projects will be explored. The analytical work can provide valuable input to \ncountry program strategies for the participating countries. Under the TA, an advisory group of \neducation and labor market experts will be established, with the experts being engaged as \nresource persons. Periodic consultations will be carried out with the members of the advisory \ngroup, including during workshops and through online discussion panels.  \n \n13.  Output 2: Capacity-building programs developed and delivered. The TA will deliver \nat least three subregional and national seminars and capacity-building programs for education \npolicy makers in the participating countries. The topics covered will be identified through the \nanalytical work under output 1 and through policy discussions with key stakeholders. The topics \nwill address shared emerging issues and concerns, such as developing relevant education \npolicies  and  strategies  and  upgrading  TVET  systems  for  better  employability.  Other  CWA \ncountries that are already receiving or have requested ADB education support will be invited, on \na selective basis, to engage in the consultation process and share their experiences. Seminars \nwill provide an opportunity to improve cooperation by bringing together key policy makers from \neducation, labor, finance, and other relevant ministries, and other key stakeholders (private \nsector representatives and members from academia and research institutions) to exchange \nideas and learn from each other.  \n \n14.  Capacity building will be achieved by drawing on the expertise of policy makers from \ndeveloped  and  developing  ADB member  countries  or consultants  with  a  significant  policy-\nmaking  background.  Capacity-building  activities  will  be  held  in  host  institutions  in  the \nparticipating countries and in other facilities where needed. The TA will fund the travel expenses \nof resource persons and a limited number of participants from each country who meet the \neligibility criteria that will be developed under the TA. Participating CWA countries may send \nadditional eligible participants, who will need to pay their own travel costs and related expenses. \nThe TA will explore the delivery of capacity development programs through videoconferencing \nfacilities  at  resident  missions,  online  and  blended  learning,  and  other  cost-effective \ntechnological platforms. The TA will bring together a wide range of stakeholders in the countries \nto create public space for informed dialogue, stronger ownership, and more innovative solutions \nin education. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, with the Public Management, Financial \nSector, and Trade Division of the Central and West Asia Department acting as the focal point \nand coordinator of consultant inputs. The division will consult on TA-related issues with relevant \nresident missions, other divisions within the Central and West Asia Department, and with the \neducation community of practice. A national steering committee, which will be set up in each \nparticipating country, will comprise representatives of the ministries responsible for education \nand skills development and the private sector. Each steering committee will endorse (i) three \n ", "  5 \nstrategic priorities for assessment, (ii) work plans, and (iii) capacity-building plans. The design \nand monitoring framework will be used to monitor implementation progress (Appendix 1).  \n \n17.  ADB inputs will include consulting services and training. All consultants under the TA will \nbe recruited on an individual basis. Individual consultant recruitment is proposed for all positions \nto facilitate selection of the best combination of thematic experts in the shortest time, and to \nenable tailoring of TA support to each country\u2019s sector reform policies. The TA will require 23 \nperson-months of international and 35 person-months of national consulting services to (i) carry \nout surveys and assessments, (ii) prepare working papers, conduct consultations on the results, \nand  discuss  follow-up  actions,  and  (iii)  prepare  and  deliver  capacity-building  activities. \nConsultants are expected to have considerable experience in education and skills development. \nThe TA will also use short-term resource persons to provide specific expertise as needed. The \noutline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  Consultants and resource persons will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The TA will be \ndisbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). The TA is expected to begin in February 2015 and to be completed \nby February 2017. Good practice and lessons will be disseminated through policy dialogue with \nrelevant institutions, and in seminar and training materials and knowledge products published \nunder the TA. The TA will be implemented in close cooperation with the participating countries, \nresident missions, and Japanese embassies in the participating countries. \n \nIV.
