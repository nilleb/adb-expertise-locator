INTRODUCTION\n1. During the Bank's Country Consultation mission to Sri Lanka in March\n1990, Government representatives stressed the need for diversifying the country's\neconomic base through the provision of suitable infrastructure for creating\ninvestment, employment and income opportunities. For this purpose, the\nGovernment proposed to set up an Export Processing Zone (EPZ) -at Koggala in the\nSouthern Province and requested Bank Technical Assistance for a feasibility study\nof the proposal. In tlay 1990, a Bank Mission followed up the request. In June\n1990, a Fact-Finding Mission visited: Sri Lanka to formulate the Technical\nAssistance for the Koggala Export Processing Zone Study.\n2. The Mission met with officials of the Government, the representatives\nof the Greater Colombo Economic Commission, private sector entrepreneurs and\nvarious multilateral andbilateriai agencies, and visited the sites of existing\nEPZs near Colonibo and the planned site for the Koggala EPZ. This report is based\non the discussions and information obtained during the Mission. The proposed\nTechnical Assistance first appeared in the AD8 Business Opportunities in June\n1990.\t - -\nII. BACKGROUND\nA.\t Economic Setting - Performance and Prospects\n3.. The Sri Lankan economy responded modestly to the measures taken by\nthe. Government in 1977 to enhance the country's economic activity through greater\nprivate sector participation, particularly in. the industrial sector. The large\npublic investment program started by the Government at about the same time\nprovided a stimulus for growth. However, since the mid-1980's, there has been\na decline in the economic performance due to structural constraints, civil\ndisturbances (since 1983), deterioration in the terms of trade and weak economic\nmanagement.\n1. . Notwitstanding the decline in the economic performance, Sri Lanka's\nbasic capacity for growth remains strong, and the country still has considerable\nnatural and human resources. The new Government formed in March 1989 has clearly\nindicated its commitment to growth-oriented adjustment reforms, while emphasizing\nits concern for more equity in the distribution of the benefits of development.\nThe most serious constraints on the country's economic development have been\nstructural in nature, and include: a large investment-savings gap and a\nconsequent heavy reliance on foreign borrowings; a narrow agricultural export\nbase resulting in trade and current account imbalances; a large and Inefficient\npublic sector; and various constraints on the private sector. To remove these\nconstraints and to achieve a higher level of sustainable growth, the Government\ndrew us macroeconomic stabilization and medium term adjustment programs with\nassistance from IMF and the World Bank.\t The adjustment programs emphasize\t -\nprivate sector participation, and equitable growth.\n5. Since the last. quarter of 1989, the level of social unrest has\ndeclined particularly in the.south of-the country. This has offered opportunity\nfor the Government to undertake reconstruction and rehabilitation and implement\nits reforms in the: region. -\nDisclaimer : the PDF file attachment may not contain the complete text index.

The development of Sri Lanka's industrial sector is\nconsidered essential for providing employment to a large and growing labor force\nand the need to broaden the economic base from its narrow concentration on\nplantation crops. Until 1977, industrial development was based on policies\nemphasizing import-substitution and state interventions which resulted in low\neconomic growth and balance-of-payments problems. A shift in policies in 1977\ndid not alter the importance the Government assigned to industrial sector\nde.'elopment. In fact, under the policies introduced in 1977; the Government\nexpected to achieve industrial growth and employment even more rapidly by\nenhancing the exposure of the economy to market forces, by encouraging industries\nwith an export- potential, and by developing an industrial sector that could\nwithstand international competition.\t -\nA review of the industrial sector shows that the Government's\ndevelopment objectives have not been achieved fully. Contributing less than\n15 per cent of GOP and providing employment to only 10 per cent of the country's\nlabor force, manufacturing remains a relatively small-.sector of the economy,\ndespite a high level of protection. The major factors underlying the sector's\nsmall contributionto growth are: Ci) preponderance of poorly performing Public\nManufacturing Enterprises (PMEs); (ii) a high rate of effective protection;\n(iii) business environment which has discouraged private investors, with its\ncumbersome bureaucratic procedures and licensing requirements; and (iv)\nlimitations on foreign private- investment which is restricted by regulations and\ntaxes such as a 100 per cent tax on transfer of jquity shares to foreigners.\n8. With due recognition of the constraints on industrial development,\nthe recent (1987) reports of the Industrial Policy Committee (IPC) and the\nPresidential Tariff Commission (PlC) have addressed the key issues involved and'\nmade several recommendations. The IPC proposes, that barring few exceptional\ncases, all PMEs be sold to the private sector. The IPC and PlC reports also\nre-commend reduction in the average rate of effective protection (from 100 per\ncent to about 50 per cent), as well as reduction in the dispersion of effective\nprotection across sectors. As a-first step, the 1988 budget brought the maximum\nnominal tariff of 100 per cent down to 60 per cent, stipulated a minimum tariff\nof 5 per cent, and eliminated all import licensing requirements excepting those\nneeded on health or security grounds.\n9.\t The Government is taking steps to improve the business environment\nand the private sector's confidence. In the 1990 budget, three measures\nannounced by the Government are noteworthy: (i) lifting of all restrictions on\nforeign equity participation except in specifically reserved areas and\nelimination of 100 per cent tax on transfer of equity shares to foreigners; (ii)\nreforming the quota allocation system to exporters of garments with a view to\neliminating trade in unused quotas. Effective July 1989, quotas for garment\nexports to the United States and the European Community were made fully\ntransferable, and the annual increase in quotas negotiated with importing\ncountries will be auctioned from the quota year 1990-1991; and (iii) the\nappointment of a high-level committee to look into industrialists' recurrent\ncomplaints regarding cumbersome and time-consuming bureaucratic processes.\nDisclaimer : the PDF file attachment may not contain the complete text index.

In its drive to develop an export-oriented economy, Sri Lanka has\nintroduced a number of export promotion measures and developed a range of fiscal\nincentives. The primary objectives of the export promotion schemes are:\nproviding exporters duty-free access to imported inputs; providing inducements\nto export activities; and providing exporters access to credit on attractive\nterni. The Greater Colombo-Economic Commission (GCEC) was established in 1978\nfor the establishment and promotion of EPZs. There are a number of schemes in\nplace to ensure that firms that produce for export can gain inputs at world\nprices: first, the EPZs operated by the GCEC enables exporters in the zones to\nobtain imported inputs as well as machinery and equipment free of customs duty;\nsecond, the Manufacture-in-Bond Scheme permits duty-free imports meant for re-\nexport directly into factory premises owned by exporters; and third, the Custom\nRebate Scheme is a system of general rebates granted to raw materials and\npackaging materials for the processing of non-traditional exports.\n11. There are a number of fiscal measures and other forms of\nassistance to \u2022exporters designed to encourage export activities. First,\nunder the Investment Relief scheme, those individuals purchasing shares in\ndesignated higt-priority industries are allowed to deduct the amount of the\npurchase from taxable income. Second, a five-year fufl tax holiday is applicable\nto profits derived from the export of manufactured goods. Those manufacturers,\nwho have a net foreign exchange earnings of 50 per cent or more of the value of\nexports, are eligible for an additional five-year half tax holiday. Third,. the\nExport Development Investment Support Scheme is intended to reward exporters for\npast export performance and to encourage them to invest in further expansion of\nexport activity. tn addition, there are schmes for supply of credit to\nexporters before and after shipment. The medium- to long- term credit takes the\nform of concessionary refinancing of up to 70 per cent of the amount advanced\nby commercial banks. Finally, there are services provided to cover exporters\nagainst non-payment by overseas buyers, issue bank guarantees for preshipment.\nor postshipment financing to cover against commercial default, and issue export\nperformance guarantees.\n12. Presently, there are two EPZs located near Colombo, one at Katunayake\nadjacent to the international airport and the other at Blyagama. The Katunayake\nEPZ has been in operation since 1978 and there are currently about 70 factories\nunder commercial operation and an additional 12 factories are under construction.\nThe Biyagama EPZ, established in 1 g84, has about 24 factories currently in\noperation and a further eight factories are expected to begin construction\nshortly. Available information on the EPZs as of May 1990, suggests that these\nEPZS have played an important role in facilitating the implementation of the\nGovernment's export-oriented industrial strategy: of the total number of\nprojects approved, about 60 per cent have been implemented in the EPZs; the ratio\nof foreign to local investment incurred is approximately 50:50; over 62,000\ndirect jobs have been created to date; and cumulative investment and export\nearnings during the period 1978-1990 amounted to Rs 16.1 billion and Rs 48.5\nbillion, respectively.\n13. In the light of positive experience gained from these EPZs which are\nreaching saturation and are expected to be fully utilized by 1992, and\nconsidering the lead time required for developing a new industria' site, the\nGovernment considers it timely to undertake a detailed feasibility study of a\npossible tird EPZ at Koggala.\t The. site seiction at Koggala is based on a\nDisclaimer : the PDF file attachment may not contain the complete text index.

The provision of infrastructure and export schemes\napplicable to industrialists/exporters, require careful assessment in terms of\nthe costs involved in providing incentives and In relation to the potential net\ngains to the economy as a whole. The techno-ecoriomic feasibility of establishing\nthe Koggala Export Processing Zone (KGEPZ) therefore needs to be evaluated in\nthe broader context of socioeconomic, industry and trade policies. \t The\nidentificationand evaluation of policy issues would facilitate the incorporation\nof appropriate measures in the planning and implementation of the KGEPZ. A\nregional impact analysis is. also needed. Further, it is necessary to identify\nthe means through which appropriate backward linkagescould be established to\nlocal resource-based industries and the hinterland of the Southern Province.\nThe policy issues involved in making the Industrial sector export-oriented would\nba clarified by the proposed technical assistance.\nhr.

INTRODUCTION\n1. During the Bank's Country Consultation mission to Sri Lanka in March\n1990, Government representatives stressed the need for diversifying the country's\neconomic base through the provision of suitable infrastructure for creating\ninvestment, employment and income opportunities. For this purpose, the\nGovernment proposed to set up an Export Processing Zone (EPZ) -at Koggala in the\nSouthern Province and requested Bank Technical Assistance for a feasibility study\nof the proposal. In tlay 1990, a Bank Mission followed up the request. In June\n1990, a Fact-Finding Mission visited: Sri Lanka to formulate the Technical\nAssistance for the Koggala Export Processing Zone Study.\n2. The Mission met with officials of the Government, the representatives\nof the Greater Colombo Economic Commission, private sector entrepreneurs and\nvarious multilateral andbilateriai agencies, and visited the sites of existing\nEPZs near Colonibo and the planned site for the Koggala EPZ. This report is based\non the discussions and information obtained during the Mission. The proposed\nTechnical Assistance first appeared in the AD8 Business Opportunities in June\n1990.\t - -\nII. BACKGROUND\nA.\t Economic Setting - Performance and Prospects\n3.. The Sri Lankan economy responded modestly to the measures taken by\nthe. Government in 1977 to enhance the country's economic activity through greater\nprivate sector participation, particularly in. the industrial sector. The large\npublic investment program started by the Government at about the same time\nprovided a stimulus for growth. However, since the mid-1980's, there has been\na decline in the economic performance due to structural constraints, civil\ndisturbances (since 1983), deterioration in the terms of trade and weak economic\nmanagement.\n1. . Notwitstanding the decline in the economic performance, Sri Lanka's\nbasic capacity for growth remains strong, and the country still has considerable\nnatural and human resources. The new Government formed in March 1989 has clearly\nindicated its commitment to growth-oriented adjustment reforms, while emphasizing\nits concern for more equity in the distribution of the benefits of development.\nThe most serious constraints on the country's economic development have been\nstructural in nature, and include: a large investment-savings gap and a\nconsequent heavy reliance on foreign borrowings; a narrow agricultural export\nbase resulting in trade and current account imbalances; a large and Inefficient\npublic sector; and various constraints on the private sector. To remove these\nconstraints and to achieve a higher level of sustainable growth, the Government\ndrew us macroeconomic stabilization and medium term adjustment programs with\nassistance from IMF and the World Bank.\t The adjustment programs emphasize\t -\nprivate sector participation, and equitable growth.\n5. Since the last. quarter of 1989, the level of social unrest has\ndeclined particularly in the.south of-the country. This has offered opportunity\nfor the Government to undertake reconstruction and rehabilitation and implement\nits reforms in the: region. -\nDisclaimer : the PDF file attachment may not contain the complete text index.

The development of Sri Lanka's industrial sector is\nconsidered essential for providing employment to a large and growing labor force\nand the need to broaden the economic base from its narrow concentration on\nplantation crops. Until 1977, industrial development was based on policies\nemphasizing import-substitution and state interventions which resulted in low\neconomic growth and balance-of-payments problems. A shift in policies in 1977\ndid not alter the importance the Government assigned to industrial sector\nde.'elopment. In fact, under the policies introduced in 1977; the Government\nexpected to achieve industrial growth and employment even more rapidly by\nenhancing the exposure of the economy to market forces, by encouraging industries\nwith an export- potential, and by developing an industrial sector that could\nwithstand international competition.\t -\nA review of the industrial sector shows that the Government's\ndevelopment objectives have not been achieved fully. Contributing less than\n15 per cent of GOP and providing employment to only 10 per cent of the country's\nlabor force, manufacturing remains a relatively small-.sector of the economy,\ndespite a high level of protection. The major factors underlying the sector's\nsmall contributionto growth are: Ci) preponderance of poorly performing Public\nManufacturing Enterprises (PMEs); (ii) a high rate of effective protection;\n(iii) business environment which has discouraged private investors, with its\ncumbersome bureaucratic procedures and licensing requirements; and (iv)\nlimitations on foreign private- investment which is restricted by regulations and\ntaxes such as a 100 per cent tax on transfer of jquity shares to foreigners.\n8. With due recognition of the constraints on industrial development,\nthe recent (1987) reports of the Industrial Policy Committee (IPC) and the\nPresidential Tariff Commission (PlC) have addressed the key issues involved and'\nmade several recommendations. The IPC proposes, that barring few exceptional\ncases, all PMEs be sold to the private sector. The IPC and PlC reports also\nre-commend reduction in the average rate of effective protection (from 100 per\ncent to about 50 per cent), as well as reduction in the dispersion of effective\nprotection across sectors. As a-first step, the 1988 budget brought the maximum\nnominal tariff of 100 per cent down to 60 per cent, stipulated a minimum tariff\nof 5 per cent, and eliminated all import licensing requirements excepting those\nneeded on health or security grounds.\n9.\t The Government is taking steps to improve the business environment\nand the private sector's confidence. In the 1990 budget, three measures\nannounced by the Government are noteworthy: (i) lifting of all restrictions on\nforeign equity participation except in specifically reserved areas and\nelimination of 100 per cent tax on transfer of equity shares to foreigners; (ii)\nreforming the quota allocation system to exporters of garments with a view to\neliminating trade in unused quotas. Effective July 1989, quotas for garment\nexports to the United States and the European Community were made fully\ntransferable, and the annual increase in quotas negotiated with importing\ncountries will be auctioned from the quota year 1990-1991; and (iii) the\nappointment of a high-level committee to look into industrialists' recurrent\ncomplaints regarding cumbersome and time-consuming bureaucratic processes.\nDisclaimer : the PDF file attachment may not contain the complete text index.

In its drive to develop an export-oriented economy, Sri Lanka has\nintroduced a number of export promotion measures and developed a range of fiscal\nincentives. The primary objectives of the export promotion schemes are:\nproviding exporters duty-free access to imported inputs; providing inducements\nto export activities; and providing exporters access to credit on attractive\nterni. The Greater Colombo-Economic Commission (GCEC) was established in 1978\nfor the establishment and promotion of EPZs. There are a number of schemes in\nplace to ensure that firms that produce for export can gain inputs at world\nprices: first, the EPZs operated by the GCEC enables exporters in the zones to\nobtain imported inputs as well as machinery and equipment free of customs duty;\nsecond, the Manufacture-in-Bond Scheme permits duty-free imports meant for re-\nexport directly into factory premises owned by exporters; and third, the Custom\nRebate Scheme is a system of general rebates granted to raw materials and\npackaging materials for the processing of non-traditional exports.\n11. There are a number of fiscal measures and other forms of\nassistance to \u2022exporters designed to encourage export activities. First,\nunder the Investment Relief scheme, those individuals purchasing shares in\ndesignated higt-priority industries are allowed to deduct the amount of the\npurchase from taxable income. Second, a five-year fufl tax holiday is applicable\nto profits derived from the export of manufactured goods. Those manufacturers,\nwho have a net foreign exchange earnings of 50 per cent or more of the value of\nexports, are eligible for an additional five-year half tax holiday. Third,. the\nExport Development Investment Support Scheme is intended to reward exporters for\npast export performance and to encourage them to invest in further expansion of\nexport activity. tn addition, there are schmes for supply of credit to\nexporters before and after shipment. The medium- to long- term credit takes the\nform of concessionary refinancing of up to 70 per cent of the amount advanced\nby commercial banks. Finally, there are services provided to cover exporters\nagainst non-payment by overseas buyers, issue bank guarantees for preshipment.\nor postshipment financing to cover against commercial default, and issue export\nperformance guarantees.\n12. Presently, there are two EPZs located near Colombo, one at Katunayake\nadjacent to the international airport and the other at Blyagama. The Katunayake\nEPZ has been in operation since 1978 and there are currently about 70 factories\nunder commercial operation and an additional 12 factories are under construction.\nThe Biyagama EPZ, established in 1 g84, has about 24 factories currently in\noperation and a further eight factories are expected to begin construction\nshortly. Available information on the EPZs as of May 1990, suggests that these\nEPZS have played an important role in facilitating the implementation of the\nGovernment's export-oriented industrial strategy: of the total number of\nprojects approved, about 60 per cent have been implemented in the EPZs; the ratio\nof foreign to local investment incurred is approximately 50:50; over 62,000\ndirect jobs have been created to date; and cumulative investment and export\nearnings during the period 1978-1990 amounted to Rs 16.1 billion and Rs 48.5\nbillion, respectively.\n13. In the light of positive experience gained from these EPZs which are\nreaching saturation and are expected to be fully utilized by 1992, and\nconsidering the lead time required for developing a new industria' site, the\nGovernment considers it timely to undertake a detailed feasibility study of a\npossible tird EPZ at Koggala.\t The. site seiction at Koggala is based on a\nDisclaimer : the PDF file attachment may not contain the complete text index.
