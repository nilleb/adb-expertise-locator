To further its decentralization policy for local government units (LGUs), the Government \nof Kingdom of Thailand (the Government) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide technical assistance (TA) to facilitate commercial borrowing by local government units \n(LGUs). A Fact-Finding Mission that was conducted from 9 to 11 August 2004 reached an \nunderstanding with the Government on the TA objectives, scope, financing, and implementation \narrangements.1 Appendix 1 provides a TA framework. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Over 80% of Thailand\u2019s economic growth is generated in the urban regions, and the \ndemand for urban infrastructure is greater than it has ever been. However, investment in urban \nareas is only a fraction of what is required to sustain these engines of the country's growth. \nTraditionally, financing and implementation of utility and infrastructure services in Thailand have \nbeen a function of the central Government. Such financing has included budget-funded projects \ndelivered by central Government agencies, the use of state-owned enterprises to raise financing \nunder a sovereign guarantee, and capital grants to LGUs. Following the Constitution of 1997 \nand the Decentralization Act of 1999, the scene is now changing. LGUs are expected to play a \nmuch greater role in providing urban infrastructure and services. The Decentralization Act of \n1999 aims to significantly change local public expenditure arrangements. Specifically, the Act  \nmandates that the total revenue of local administrations is to be at least 20% of the revenue of \nthe national Government by 2001 and 35% by 2006. The total revenue of LGUs was almost \n21% of the central Government's revenue in FY2001, and is projected to be around 22.5% in \nthe current fiscal year (FY2004). The targets are being met through massive revenue sharing \nand intergovernmental grants. LGU locally generated revenue accounts for less than 10% of its \ntotal. Traditional revenue sources for LGUs include a basic property tax, land tax, billboard tax, \nanimal slaughter levies, and nontax revenues such as fines and utility tariffs. \n \n3.  While the reallocation of resources to LGUs will no doubt assist them in meeting their \nnew obligations, they will need to raise additional finance to meet the considerable investment \ndemand that accompanies urbanization. There is now increasing attention to the concept of \nsubsovereign debt as a means to fill the investment gap for urban infrastructure and services. A \nnew Public Debt Management Act currently before Parliament includes a provision prohibiting \nthe central Government from providing sovereign guarantees to subsovereign borrowing. It is \nanticipated that sovereign guarantees, when available, will be offered only on commercial terms \nin the future. \n \n4.  Previously, revenue sharing and allocation of grants had been based on a combination \nof criteria, such as population and locally generated revenue. Now, the entitlement for each \nLGU for its share of revenue sharing and intergovernment grants is not fixed under law. Instead, \nthe Decentralization Act of 1999 empowers the Government\u2019s Decentralization Committee to \nissue notifications setting criteria, procedures and conditions to allocate revenue and grants \namong LGUs. Various laws establishing LGUs also allow them to supplement their revenue \nthrough borrowing, but they are required to seek permission from the Ministry of Interior for each \nspecific borrowing. Notwithstanding this provision, borrowings by LGUs have so far not been \nencouraged, except for programs specially arranged by the central Government, such as the \nLocal  Development  Fund  and  the  World  Bank-funded  Regional  Urban  Development  Fund \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 2 November 2004. ", "2    \n(RUDF). These programs have very limited impact on LGU finance. Also, although LGUs have \nlegal authority to incur debt, there are some unresolved uncertainties over the precise definition \nof components of borrowing structures normally used by private commercial lending sources, \nwhether in the commercial bank market or long-term bond market. Laws establishing LGUs \nmandate that they must honor their financial obligations regardless of whether they have set \naside budget allocations for these obligations. A clear and well-articulated regulatory framework \nis essential for the future of subsovereign debt in Thailand. \n \n5.  The reliance of LGUs on the central Government for funding and technical expertise has \nundermined the development of management and financial and management capacity within \nthe LGUs. While the RUDF has assisted some LGUs in preparing and managing projects, fiscal \nplanning and management, financial reporting and resource mobilization, the project borrowings \nhave been small, and more remains to be done particularly for medium to larger scale LGU \nproject borrowings. That said, although LGUs undoubtedly could benefit from capacity building, \nit would be more appropriate for them to consider outsourcing at least a designated portion of \nthe work. For this to happen, the LGUs would need training in contracting out of works and the \nongoing management of such contracts. \n \n6.  A weak regulatory framework, together with weak LGUs with limited capacity to generate \nrevenue, has not been conducive to the entry of the commercial market into the subsovereign \ndebt area. However, some government-owned institutions, such as the Krung Thai local Bank \nand the Government Savings Bank, have made some minor interventions for facilities such as \nmarkets, but the cited constraints have so far prevented any significant intervention. To improve \nconfidence  in  the  commercial  market,  LGUs  need  to  build  capacity  and  demonstrate \ncommitment to resource mobilization reform. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The TA will develop sustainable access of local governments to private commercial \nlending  and  bond  markets.  The  objectives  are  to  (i)  strengthen  the  capacity  of  local \ngovernments in financial reporting and project planning and execution; (ii) assess existing LGU \naccounting and auditing practices and suggest improvements consistent with best international \npractices, realistically phased in so as to be sustainable; (iii) develop and implement detailed \nrules governing government borrowing from commercial lenders and issuance of bonds, with \nsuch rules to support enforceable security structures and removal of unnecessary deterrents to \npurchase of local government bonds by major investor classes; and (iv) identify and structure \ntwo pilot projects for bond issuance for distribution to a multiple and diversified private investor \nbase. The local government capacity-building objective will include communication with private \nmarket  participants  such  as  rating  agencies  and  accountants.  The  TA  will  build  on  the \nsuccesses achieved by the public sector RUDF model, particularly in LGU financial reporting, \nproject  planning  and  execution.  Policy  dialogue  with  both  the  World  Bank  and  RUDF  will \nexamine the lessons learned from the RUDF model. The TA will contribute to the building of a \nprivate market credit culture, which recognizes and rewards local governments able to transmit \nprofessionally assembled transparent information to markets regularly.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The  TA  will  have  five  components.  Component  A:  Context  assessment  of  local \ngovernments, component B: Capacity building for selected local governments, component C: \n ", "                                                                                                                                            3\nFramework to govern local governments borrowing, component D: Market assessment, and \ncomponent E: Pilot projects preparation.  \n \n9.  Component A will identify the local governments to be assisted. Selection criteria will be \ngeared  to  prioritize  local  government  project  borrowers  judged  to  have  good  near-term \nborrowing execution potential. This component will also focus on definition of practices for \naccounting and auditing of selected LGUs and identification of deficiencies (if any) in national \nstandards  that  would  impede  ultimate  conformance  with  international  public  accounting \nstandards.  Finally,  this  component  will  start  with  written  and  verbal  communication  of \nsuggestions for upgrading such standards, which will require extensive consultation with the \nInstitute  of  Certified  Accountants  and  Auditors  of  Thailand  and  with  a  sampling  of  local \ngovernment officials.  \n \n10.  Component  B  will  assist  the  selected  local  governments  to  prepare  for  borrowing. \nProject execution assistance will not only consider needs in project design and implementation \nbut also focus on structure and implementation of revenue mechanisms (enterprise operating \nincome, user fees, special taxes, etc.). Preparation for borrowing will also serve to improve \nfinancial reporting practices and organization of other data needed for disclosure to private debt \nmarket participants, building on the financial reporting practices already being used by LGUs \nwho are borrowers from the RUDF and moving such practices closer to international public \naccounting standards. Component B will include a focus on delivery of accounting and auditing \nreports. Training for bookkeeping and accounting practice will be primarily in the form of  \"on the \njob training\" using accounting manuals for the designated LGUs with minimal reliance on formal \nseminars or conferences.  \n \n11.  Component C will first identify weaknesses in legal protection for borrowers, investors, \nand guarantors. Solutions to identified issues will be discussed with relevant offices of the \nGovernment  including  the  Public  Debt  Management  Office  (PDMO),  Department  of  Local \nGovernment, and Office of the Attorney General. Primary legislation generally supports LGU \nborrowings from commercial sources but there is a need for more specific implementation \nregulations/second-tier legislation.  \n \n12.  Component  D  will  include  the  study  of  at  least  four  major  classifications  of  bond \ninvestors (commercial banks, pension funds, insurance companies and retail individuals) via \nsurveys  and  other  research.  Major  incentives  and  deterrents  to  investors  groups  will  be \nidentified. Suggestions to mitigate major deterrents will be developed. Of particular importance \nwill be countermeasures to the present practices of some government agencies to offer below-\nmarket financing terms, thereby \"crowding out\" private investors from the market. During this \npart of the TA, one or more external credit rating agencies experienced in servicing the local \ngovernment market in a commercially viable manner will be engaged. To support this objective, \nthe TA will fund \"shadow credit ratings\" for local governments that have completed component \nB activities and have indicated a  willingness to participate in such a ratings process.  \n \n13.  Component E will require ADB to select, for possible support, two pilot projects for \ndetailed bond issue preparation. Tasks will include financial structuring, development of legal \ndocumentation  and  market  surveys  to  facilitate  diversified  and  broad  investor  participation \nduring the time of bond sale.  \n \n14.  In  terms  of  sequencing,  component  A  activities  will  precede  relevant  component  B \nactivities. There will otherwise be considerable latitude to run all components of the TA in \nparallel except for component E, which will need to await substantial completion of all other \n ", "4    \ncomponents. To assess the results of the TA activities, a series of performance indicators will \nbe established as a baseline at the start of the TA and will be monitored throughout its duration.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $960,000 equivalent, comprising $460,100 in \nforeign exchange and $499,900 equivalent in local currency. All the foreign exchange cost and \n$209,900 equivalent in local currency cost, amounting to $670,000 equivalent will be financed \nby ADB on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. ADB financing will cover consulting \nservices, workshops, reports, administration support, reports and contingencies. The remaining \nlocal currency cost of $290,000 equivalent will be met by the Government, and will cover \nremuneration of counterpart staff at the central, provincial, and LGU levels, and the provision of \noffice accommodation and utilities. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  PDMO within the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency for the TA. \nThe TA will involve coordination and liaison with a number of other government agencies \nincluding the Department of Local Administration within the Ministry of Interior, Office of the \nDecentralization  Committee  under  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  Office  of  the  National \nEconomic and Social Development Board, Comptroller General Department within the MOF, \nOffice of the Auditor General, and Attorney Generals Office. PDMO will establish a project office \nto house the consultants and administrative support funded under the TA.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over  24 months, starting in March 2005 with completion in \nFebruary 2007. The TA will require approximately 29 person-months of consulting services in \nthe fields of accounting, legal and tariff recruited through a firm. Full technical proposals will be \nrequired (with about 16 person-months international and 13 domestic). Rating agency services \nwill  be  contracted  separately  through  a  biodata  selection  process  for  firms.    One  of  the \ninternational  consultants  will  be  the  team  leader,  responsible  for  all  aspects  of  TA \nimplementation. The firm will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and using the QCBS method and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nengaging  domestic  consultants.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  are  in \nAppendix 3. All procurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for \nProcurement. \n \n18.  Project  reports  will  include  an  inception  report  including  the  work  plan  and  key \nmilestones (at the end of month 1) and quarterly progress reports, culminating in a final report at \nthe end of the project. A number of special activity reports will be prepared, based on inputs \nfrom specialists and consultants. They will be referenced and included in the progress and final \nreports. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $670,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Thailand for Commercial Financing for Local Government Units, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "  Appendix 1  5                            \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Indicators  Monitoring  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary \nand Targets  Mechanisms  Risks \n       \nGoals     \n   \nIncreased access by Local  One or more LGUs access  Milestones of each \nGovernment Units (LGUs) to  the market.  technical assistance \ndebt finance from commercial  (TA) component are \nbanks and bond markets (the  met. \nmarket) for local development \n \n       \nPurpose       \n      Assumptions \nEstablish accounting practices  Opinion from designated  Audit statement signed  There is market \nacceptable to the market  third party auditor that    acceptance. \n  defined accounting     \n  practices as consistent with     \n  international best practices     \n  for local government     \n  accounting     \n       \nEstablish financial and  Investment grade credit  Rating notification  LGUs sustain the \nmanagement systems  rating from shadow credit    systems. \nacceptable to international credit  rating process     \nrating agencies.       \n      Risk \nDefine and address the  Clean bond counsel  Written statement from  Political will may not \nweaknesses in the framework  opinion for LGU borrowers  domestic bond counsel  exist. \nthat governs LGU borrowing in     \nthe market   \n \n       \nOutputs       \nComponent A: Context       \nAssessment of Local       \nGovernments       \n      Assumptions \nIdentify eligible LGUs to  6 LGUs are selected and  Progress report  Sufficient number of \nparticipate in the TA  letters of commitment    cities meet qualification \n  signed.    criteria \n       \nConduct diagnostic study  List of recommendations  Official letter from the  Recommendations are \ncomparing LGU accounting  receives a \u201cletter of no  Institute  acceptable to the \npractices in Thailand with best  objection\u201d from the Institute    Institute. \npractice  of Certified Accountants     \n  and Auditors of Thailand \n \n       \nComponent B: Capacity       \nBuilding for Selected Local       \nGovernments       \n      Assumptions \nDevelop an accountant training  Adoption of bookkeeping  Audited accounts  LGUs and their staff \ncourse  systems and release of    sustain the new \n  audits for first trial period    systems and skills. \n       \nContinued on next page \n ", "6   Appendix 1   \nPerformance Indicators  Monitoring  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary \nand Targets  Mechanisms  Risks \n       \nAssess needs, strategy to  Preparation of project  Transaction document  Information can be \nstrengthen capability, knowledge  transaction document    obtained. \nand database covering general  specific to each LGU     \nLGU management, general LGU  (requiring disclosure of     \neconomic tax base, and project  LGU and project data)     \nexecution and operational       \ncapability       \n      Risk \nAssess pricing arrangement  LGU adoption of cost -

The technical assistance will consist of five components.  The consultants\u2019 tasks are \nlisted under each component. \n \nA.  Context Assessment of Local Governments (Component A) \n2.  The consultants for component A will carry out these specific tasks: \n(i)  Undertake a desk review of all (LGU) applicants and recommend not more than \n12 candidates to be assisted via capacity-building exercises. Complete the desk \nreview within 1 month. \n(ii)  Advise on criteria to be used in the selecting 6 LGUs from the original list of 12. \nIn preparing such criteria, consider an LGU's realistic ability to issue bonds and \ninitiate project construction by the end of calendar year 2006 or at the beginning \nof calendar year 2007. Detailed criteria will include but will not be limited to \nassessment of an LGU's track record in executing projects to date, adequacy of \nfinancial reporting systems whether from the Regional Urban Development Fund \n(RUDF) or other sources, general feasibility of project(s) proposed to be funded, \nrevenue source of repayment, and economic and tax base strength of the LGU \njurisdiction and project(s) suitable for minimum bond issue amount. Also assess \nhistorical and current evidence of continuity of management through election \ncycles and changes of elected officials. \n(iii)  Suggest whether the implementing LGU should be at the provincial, municipal, or \ndistrict/subdistrict administrative organization level. \n(iv)  Meet with each LGU to conduct interviews and collect information necessary to \nmake recommendations for ranking LGUs according to specific criteria. Should \nany  LGU  be  unable  to  provide  necessary  information  or  feedback  within  a \nprescribed period, it may not be feasible to include it in the rankings, and \n(v)  Deliver to ADB the final rankings grid within 8 weeks, along with a narrative \nevaluation comparing LGUs in each category. \n \nB.  Capacity Building for Selected Local Governments (Component B) \n3.  The consultants will carry out these specific tasks: \n(i)  Assess the existing reporting culture for LGUs, identifying specifically the areas \nthat need improvement in record keeping and reporting needed to meet best \ninternational  practices.  Incorporate  in  this  assessment  financial  reporting \npractices being used by LGU borrowers from RUDF. The objective of separate \nbusiness unit accounting for significant water and wastewater activities is an \nimportant component of the assessment. \n(ii)  Following  identification  of  deficiencies  in  financial  reporting  practices  of  six \ndesignated  LGUs,  organize  an  informal  consultative  working  group  meeting \namong representatives of major public accounting firms in Thailand to study the \nmeans for addressing relevant impediments in national accounting standards for \nLGUs. With selected LGU representatives from among the six LGUs and other \ncarefully selected LGUs including, if feasible, representatives from the Bangkok \nMetropolitan  Administration  (BMA),  informally  canvass  the  suggested \nimprovements in standards (which result from such consultations). \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n(iii)  Suggest  the  best  means  for  LGUs  to  adopt  the  use  of  international  public \naccounting standards. Suggest a phase-in of standards if necessary. \n(iv)  Determine whether cash basis, accrual basis, or some form of modified accrual \nbasis accounting would be the most appropriate financial reporting practices for \nthe selected LGUs. \n(v)  Organize  informal  discussions  with  interested  public  accountants  regarding \nrelevant aspects of auditing of the selected LGUs and  draft terms of reference  \nto be used for hiring of auditors by selected LGUs. The main objective of this task \nis  to  encourage  the  development  of  municipal  accounting  practices  within \nreputable public accounting firms. \n(vi)  Conduct on-the-job training sessions with each of the selected LGUs for book \nentry record keeping, and organize training support manuals and materials. \n(vii)  Assist each LGU with preparing first financial statements for a 6-month period,  \npreferably on an audited basis but, if unaudited, using standard practices for \nunaudited statements. \n(viii)  Develop a database as a  supplement to financial statements that can be used \nfor a comprehensive rating agency information presentation package. Include \ninformation on the local economy, tax base, management, employees, and other \nkey areas. Draw on one or more templates using best practices from other \ncountries for information disclosure documents. \n(ix)  Work with one or more rating agencies selected by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide shadow ratings.  For LGUs that complete audited statements \nand databases on schedule, information can be submitted for a \"shadow rating\". \nAssist LGUs in preparing information packages for such rating agencies and in \nanswering follow-up inquiries. \n(x)  Carry out a general assessment of alternatives for broadening and diversifying of \nthe  LGU  revenue  base  to  ensure  that  estimated  revenues  are  adequate  to \nprovide creditworthy debt service coverage ratios. \n(xi)  Prepare general recommendations for realistic improvements to existing revenue \ncollection  systems  with  specific  attention  to  sources  of  revenue  to  repay  or \nsecure debt repayment. \n(xii)  If  the  debt  finance  security  structure  is  anticipated  to  include  primary  or \nsecondary reliance on tariffs, assess tariff structures to ensure that they can \nrealistically cover estimated operating and maintenance costs, depreciation, and \ndebt  service  coverage  ratios.  Assess  the  effective  means  used  by  LGUs  to \nsurvey user willingness to pay. To the extent possible, explore means of relying \non  financial  structures  without  major  revenue  assumptions  based  on  tariff \nincreases to be implemented on a deferred or back-ended basis. \n(xiii)  Undertake a general review and assessment of each LGU's management and \noperations  and  its  capacity  for  project  execution  and  operations.  Include  an \nassessment of the need to outsource one or more detailed components of project \nexecution responsibility if such outsourcing is fundamental to the success of \nproject execution. For example, if wastewater projects were to be considered, it \nwould be necessary to review LGU experience with wastewater treatment plants \nor  other  similar  projects  to  assess  maintenance  capacity  and  suggest \nmanagement  outsourcing  to  compensate  for  any  major  perceived  capacity \nshortfall. \n(xiv)  Prepare  a  general  feasibility  review  of  project  plans  and  management  with \nresulting identification of specific factors for each LGU, which could impede or \ncreate major delays.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \n(xv)  Review basic LGU governance at board and management levels.
