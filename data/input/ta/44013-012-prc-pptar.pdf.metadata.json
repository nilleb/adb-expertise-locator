The Government requested ADB for assistance in financing the proposed Shanxi Energy \nEfficiency  and  Environment  Improvement  Project.  However,  SPG  informed  ADB  that  the \nfeasibility study and environment assessment of the proposed subprojects have not yet been \nfinalized,  thus  limited  information  is  available  at  the  moment.  This  situation  presents  an \nopportunity for fielding selected experts to assist the implementing agencies of subprojects in \nimproving the project design and familiarizing with ADB\u2019s requirements and procedures. A \nproject preparatory technical assistance (TA) is required to conduct the due diligence on several \naspects of the proposed loan (para. 9 of main text).  \n \nB.

Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n \n3.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $650,000 equivalent. It is proposed that ADB \nfinance $550,000 equivalent on a grant basis from the TA special fund-Others. The Government \nwill provide the balance of local costs, equivalent to $100,000, to cover in-kind counterpart costs \nand services for counterpart staff, office space, furniture, administrative support services, and \nlocal (city) transport and logistics costs.

Consulting Services \n4.  An  early  start  in  the  implementation  of  the  subprojects  is  critical  to  ensure  that \nimplementation activities are started during the non-heating season in 2013. Thus, in order to \nmeet  this  requirement,  immediate  start  of  data  collection  and  preliminary  assessment  of ", "3 \nproposed subprojects\u2019 documents will help identify, at an early stage, critical issues to be \ninvestigated and ensure that good quality project documentation necessary to meet the loan \nprocessing schedule is produced. The TA will thus be implemented in two stages, Part 1 (data \ngathering and preliminary assessment) and Part 2 (detailed assessment). Part 1 can commence \nimmediately while the consultant selection process for Part 2 is still ongoing. For Part 1, four \nindividual national consultants (total of 8 person-months) will be recruited by ADB in accordance \nwith the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). For Part 2, \na consulting firm will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time) through quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod (with a quality-cost ratio of 80:20) using simplified technical proposal. Part 2 will require \na total of 10.5 person-months of international and 24 person-months of national consulting \nservices.  The  required  positions  and  person-months  are  indicated  in  Table  A5.3.  The \nprocurement  of  equipment  by  consultants,  under  the  TA,  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). These equipment shall be turned over to the \nexecuting agency upon TA completion.
