The Asian Development Bank (ADB) 2003 Country Strategy and Program for the Islamic \nRepublic of Pakistan includes the provision of advisory technical assistance (TA) for capacity \nbuilding  for  rural  development  of  the  Federally  Administered  Tribal  Areas  (FATA).1  The \nGovernment of Pakistan requested the TA to strengthen the planning and management capacity \nof key FATA development institutions, and FATA community-based organizations (CBO) to \nmore effectively plan  and implement rural development activities including the FATA Rural \nDevelopment Project, proposed for ADB financing in 2004. The ADB Fact-Finding  Mission \nvisited Pakistan during 17 April\u20131 May 2003 and reached preliminary understanding with the \nGovernment on the objectives, scope, and implementation arrangements of the TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Development in the FATA significantly lags behind that of the adjoining settled districts \nof the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and the country as a whole, as reflected in the \nregion's weak socioeconomic indicators. Government estimates are that as much as 60% of \nFATA households are below the poverty line. The region has a literacy rate of 17.4% and a \nprimary school participation rate of 41.3%, which are significantly lower than the national \naverages of 45% and 77%, respectively. A mere 44% of the population has access to clean \ndrinking water, as compared with 75% for the neighboring NWFP.  \n \n3.  Key endogenous factors accounting for the limited pace of development include (i) \nlimited availability of development funds; (ii) limited or nonexistent participation of civil society in \ndevelopment activities because of local administration managing the tribal affairs mostly through \ntraditional community leaders (maliks); (iii) an ineffective centralized decision-making process \nfor planning and implementing projects; (iv) limited or nonexistent monitoring of activities and \noutputs; and (v) generally weak capacities of the government line departments working in the \nFATA  for  planning,  implementing,  and  monitoring  development  interventions.  In  addition, \nfundamental governance and values issues impact the development process in the FATA. The \nissues  include  limited  transparency,  accountability,  commitment,  empathy,  and  equity  (in \nparticular for marginalized segments of society including women and the poor). The TA will \nfocus specifically on the capacities of government line departments, and the proposed FATA \nRDP will address, to the extent feasible, the full range of aforementioned endogenous factors.  \n \n4.  Until mid-2002, FATA administration was managed by the NWFP Government. Along \nwith the provincial government, the FATA Development Corporation (FATA DC)2 also undertook \nlimited development work (in the areas of irrigation, industries, and minerals) in the FATA. \nCommencing in early 2002, the system of governance in the FATA has been changing as part \nof Government policy to bring the region into the mainstream economy and body politic. Among \nthe changes was the abolition of the FATA DC in May 2002, under a federal cabinet decree, as \npart of the reorganization process, and the creation of the Governor's Secretariat for FATA (the \nSecretariat)  in  June  2002.  The  Secretariat,  established  by  the  governor  of  NWFP  (the \nGovernor),  has  been  tasked  with  coordinating  and  funding  FATA  development  efforts.  In \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 27 March 2003.  \n2 The FATA DC was established in the early 1970s within the Federal Ministry of States and Frontier Regions \n(SAFRON), which is the federal ministry with oversight responsible for FATA affairs. \n \n ", "2 \naddition,  various  FATA-dedicated  line  departments  that  formerly  were  within  the  NWFP \ngovernment structure have been consolidated under the Secretariat.3 \n \n5.  A diagnostic study of the capacity of key levels of the FATA-specific government bodies \nin Peshawar and in Bajaur Tribal Agency identified major problems and constraints, including, \nbut not limited to the following: (i) planning, monitoring and evaluation capacities are limited; (ii) \nline departments focus on reactive decision making as against the need for proactive actions; \n(iii)  little  or  no  information  is  provided  to  the  line  departments  in  the  FATA  on  resource \navailability for making short- and medium-term plans; and (iv) there are few accountability \nchecks on the working of line departments. In addition, community development is not a priority. \nThere is limited focus on facilitating beneficiary participation in development activities, linkage of \nline  departments  with  communities  is  limited,  and  development  information  is  not  made \navailable to communities, resulting in distrust among farmers about government organizations. \n \n6.  The planning and development functions include preparation of development schemes in \na consolidated form. Planning of development activities in the FATA is undertaken at the agency \nlevel and at the head offices of the FATA line agencies. The recent reorganization leading to the \ncreation of the Secretariat has also led to decentralization of project preparation. Projects with \ninvestments up to about PRs40 million ($700,000) are prepared and approved by the Agency \nDevelopment Sub-Committee, whose functions include (i) preparation of project documents \n(known as PC-1), (ii) planning and prioritization of development schemes, (iii) assessment of the \nfeasibility of proposed schemes, and (iv) project performance monitoring. There are no planning \nand monitoring units at the head office level of the line departments working in the FATA. Thus \nthe Secretariat-based line departments perform limited or no monitoring of activities undertaken \nin the FATA. The tribal agency-level staff of the line departments undertake some monitoring \nlocally. This includes monitoring of achieving the targets of government project documents (PC-\n1s) inputs and activities and not of outputs and achieving objectives.  \n \n7.  The Secretariat-based Finance Department makes nondevelopment allocations for each \nline  department  in  the  FATA.  Line  department  heads  in  the  FATA  then  appropriate  the \nallocations made by the Secretariat Finance Department among individual functioning units and \nthis  is  communicated  to  individual  units  as  well  the  office  of  the  Accountant  General. \nAppropriations are based on \u201cdemands\u201d prepared earlier by the department heads for each unit. \nThe financial management functions of line departments at the head office include preparation \nand consolidation of budgets; maintenance of accounts; and records relating to provident fund, \npensions, and gratuities. Although the financial flow of funds are well established, the relevant \nstaff require a clear understanding of the procedures and timely submission of demands for \nfunding and follow-up of releases of funds from the Accountants Office. \n \n8.  Discussions with key officials in the Secretariat and the tribal agencies resulted in \nrecommendations that the TA address weaknesses related to planning, implementation, and \nmonitoring, as well as strengthening of sector-specific technical skills, and the effective use of \ninformation communication technology (ICT) systems. In view of the needs expressed and an \nassessment of the situation, there is significant scope for successful impact from the TA for \n                                                 \n3 The Secretariat was created  to oversee the affairs of FATA, including development efforts. It is headed by a \nsecretary to the governor, NWFP, and includes the following FATA-related line department directorates and head \noffices that were previously within the NWFP government: finance, planning and development, works and services, \nlocal government and rural development, agriculture and extension, livestock and dairy development, health, \neducation, environment and forest, and the former FATA DC departments of irrigation, industries and minerals. All \nhave been shifted to one physical location within the premises of the Secretariat. \n ", "    3 \nplanning, monitoring, and managerial strengthening of the professional staff of line agencies \nworking  in  the  FATA  and  responsible  for  broad-based  development  in  the  region,  and \nimplementation of the proposed FATA RDP. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The TA purpose is to develop and facilitate among FATA officials and other stakeholders \nrelevant skills, knowledge, and attitudes to achieve strategic objectives and to facilitate effective \nrural development in the FATA. A particular focus will be on strengthening the capabilities of the \nline  agencies  working  in  the  FATA  to  plan,  design,  manage,  monitor,  and  evaluate  rural \ndevelopment projects, with particular regard to the proposed loan-financed FATA RDP. This \nincludes  agency  and  Secretariat-based  staff.  The  departments  involved  include  those  in \nplanning and development,4 finance, livestock and dairy development; agriculture extension; \nlocal government and rural development; forestry department\u2019 and works and services. A logical \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n10.  Expected outputs include (i) development of a more effective approach to planning and \nmanagement that is appropriate to the institutional and resource capacity of the Secretariat and \nagency-based staff; (ii) strengthened coordination strategies and arrangements to optimize the \neffectiveness  of  development  activities  in  the  region;  and  (iii)  strengthened  financial \nmanagement  systems  and  procedures  covering  planning,  budgeting,  and  cash  flow \nmanagement  and  systems  and  procedures  to  monitor  financial  and  implementation \nperformance.  \n \n11.  Capacity-building efforts will also be undertaken to enhance the competence of select \nCBOs working in the three target FATA agencies. Efforts will focus on strengthening managerial \nand facilitation capacities of the CBOs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will have the following main activities: \n \n(i.)  Planning and monitoring. Key staff responsible for the preparation of PC-1s, \nmonitoring, and reporting will be selected for training in planning, monitoring, and \nevaluation. The target group will be selected from the agency planning cells and \nrelevant line departments in the three tribal agencies, as well as the Secretariat-\nbased  Finance  Department  staff  and  department  heads.  Training  will  be \nconducted through learning-by-doing, case studies in participatory workshops, \nand some formal classroom training. Accordingly, the TA will identify available \ntraining facilities and prepare training material and modules. Available training \nfacilities  include  but  are  not  limited  to  the  Pakistan  Academy  for  Rural \nDevelopment,  National  Rural  Support  Programme,  Institute  of  Management \nSciences,  University  of  Peshawar,  and  Sarhad  Rural  Support  Programme's \nHuman Resource Development Center. Local technical experts will be hired as \nneeded to provide additional subject matter specialized training. \n \n                                                 \n4 The proposed agency planning cells within the local government and rural development offices in the FATA will \nrepresent the Planning and Development Department of the Secretariat. \n ", "4 \n(ii.)  Financial  management  and  budgeting.  The  financial  and  budgeting \nprocedures and rules of business are well laid out but require familiarization for \ndecision makers within the Secretariat and FATA-based line departments. Short-\nterm training will be provided in finance, budgeting, and auditing procedures for \nthe  development  and  the  nondevelopment  fund  releases  and  reporting  of \nexpenses.  \n \n(iii.)  Familiarization with ADB policies, procedures, and guidelines. The TA will \nfamiliarize the Secretariat and relevant FATA-based line department staff with \nADB's  safeguard  policies  and  procedures,  guidelines  and  procedures  for \nprocurement,  consultant  selection  procedures,  project  financial  management, \netc. \n \n(iv.)  CBO  strengthening.  CBOs  in  the  FATA  are  not  necessarily  development \nfocused or professionally managed. Their present forms and structures need to \nbe identified and then built to a level leading to community participation in \ndevelopment projects. This is a task for the  long-term TA provided under the \nFATA RDP. However, for short-term measures could be taken for identifying \nsome NGOs and their services that can be used for strengthening CBOs. \n \n(v.)  Stakeholders  consultations  and  participation.  Decision  making  seldom \ninvolves consultations with or participation of beneficiaries (including women) and \nline department field workers at the grass roots level. A case study approach for \ntraining line department professional staff of the tribal agency and Secretariat \nlevels should  be followed, as well as other relevant training and sensitization \napproaches. Requisite workshops conducted at the field level would benefit from \nthe participation of the grass roots field workers of line departments. \n \n(vi.)  Information,  communication  technology  (ICT).  The  TA  will  identify \napproaches to address needs, provide training requirements, and contract ICT-\nrelated organizations.  \n \n13.  Training will be undertaken through participatory workshops and classroom training. Key \npersonnel to be responsible for project management, especially for the proposed FATA RDP, \nwill be identified for intensive on-the-job training during TA implementation. The TA also will \ndevelop course modules, materials, and manuals to be used by the trainees and refined for use \nby the proposed FATA RDP. All training activities must be recorded, trainee performance  \nmonitored and evaluated, and recommendations made for staff replacement, as necessary. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $605,000 equivalent, consisting of $143,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $462,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide \n$465,000 equivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $322,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis under ADB's TA funding program. \nThe Government will provide the remaining local currency cost of $140,000 equivalent, mainly \nfor counterpart staff and other support services, office accommodation and facilities, equipment, \nand local transport. Detailed cost estimates are found in Appendix 2. \n ", "    5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  To ensure the success of up-front capacity building, the Government must put in place \ndedicated counterpart staff units. This institutional arrangement is crucial, as even if there are \nchanges in personnel later, some of the experience and learning will be retained and trickle \ndown.  Indeed,  appointment  of  a  project  director  and  establishment  of  a  core  project \nmanagement unit will be a condition for negotiations on the loan for the proposed FATA RDP, \nscheduled for approval in 2004. Accordingly, early establishment of the unit is essential so that \nthe  appointed  staff  can  directly  interact  with  the  TA  consultants  and  undertake  the  rural \ndevelopment project preparatory work. \n \n16.  The Secretariat will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and will (i) be responsible for \noverall  coordination  with  ADB,  (ii)  provide  full  administrative  and  technical  support  to  the \nconsultants, (iii) coordinate all project activities with the relevant FATA Agencies, and (iv) \nprovide  for  the  consultants  requisite  office  space  with  appropriate  communication  means. \nCooperation will be maintained, where necessary, with any consultants under the proposed \nFATA RDP. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months, commencing in April 2004 and ending in \nSeptember 2005. ADB will recruit, under the quality- and cost-based selection method and \nusing the simplified technical proposal, a firm or consortium of international and domestic \nconsultants  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. A total of 6 \nperson-months of international (institutional and local governance expertise) and 29 person-\nmonths of domestic experts (in project management; training; financial management; planning, \nmonitoring, and evaluation; community development; and ICT) will be required. Allocations are \nalso made for additional training needs, to be identified during TA implementation, for which \nlocal technical experts will be hired as needed by the TA team on a daily rate basis. These \nallocations are for 100 person-days. Finally, block allocations are provided for in-country training \ninstitutes for training needs identified during the TA implementation. Appendix 3 provides the \noutline terms of reference for consulting services. Equipment will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n18.  The consultants' reporting requirements will include (i) a brief inception report within 3 \nweeks of TA commencement, (ii) quarterly progress reports, (iii) a draft final report summarizing \nthe achievements of the TA, and (iv) a final report based on revisions to the draft final report. \nThe team leader and deputy team leader will be responsible for preparing and submitting the \nrequisite  reports  to  the  Government  and  ADB.  In  the  course  of  TA  implementation,  the \nconsultants will organize training programs and workshops in Peshawar and the tribal agencies, \nas appropriate. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $465,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for Capacity Building for Rural Development of the Federally \nAdministered Tribal Areas, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nGoal       \nEnhance local government  1.
