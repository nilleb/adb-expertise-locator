Asian cities and countries recognize the need to improve their air quality, as reflected in \na number of key strategic documents: (i) Framework for Environmentally Sustainable Cities,1  \nadopted in December 2003 by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member \ngovernments; (ii) Regional Implementation Plan for Sustainable Development in Asia and the \nPacific  Region,  2006\u20132010,2  adopted  by  the  Meeting  of  Ministers  at  the  Fifth  Ministerial \nConference on Environment and Development in Asia and the Pacific in March 2005; and (iii) \nAichi  Statement  on  Environmentally  Sustainable  Transport,3  adopted  in  August  2005  by \nrepresentatives  from  ASEAN,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  Republic  of  Korea,  and \nMongolia. All these documents acknowledge the importance of a regional approach to air quality \nmanagement (AQM) in Asia and the major role that regional organizations such as ADB can \nplay in this effort.4 \n \n2.  The regional technical assistance (TA)5 will help Asian cities and countries reduce air \npollution more speedily by intensifying efforts to develop AQM capacity. An important step is \nintegrating AQM into the strategies, policies, programs, and projects of developing member \ncountries (DMCs) and development agencies such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \n3.  The TA is based on a needs assessment to determine the priorities for regional AQM. \nThe assessment was part of the evaluation of the Clean Air Initiative for Asian Cities (CAI-\nAsia).6 Local stakeholders representing government and nongovernment organizations from \nPRC, Indonesia, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam were consulted during a CAI-Asia \ncoordination meeting in Bangkok, July 2005. The design and monitoring framework of the TA is \nin Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Air pollution continues to threaten the environment, quality of life, and people\u2019s health in \nurban Asia. While some cities have stabilized the levels for some parameters such as sulfur \ndioxide  (SO ),  total  suspended  particulates  (TSP),  and  particulate  matter  less  than  10 \n2\nmicrometers in diameter (PM ), pollution levels in most cities are still above World Health \n10\nOrganization (WHO)-recommended guidelines and national air quality standards.7  \n \n5.  To improve AQM in Asian cities, ADB, World Bank, and other development agencies \nestablished  CAI-Asia  in  2001,8  a  regional  multisector  network  with  over  120  institutional \nmembers and more than 700 individual members. The first phase of CAI-Asia (2001\u20132004) saw \n                                                 \n1  Available at www.aseansec.org/framework.htm. \n2  Available at www.unescap.org/mced/mom/ and \nwww.unescap.org/mced/documents/presession/english/SOMCED5_5E_RIP.pdf. \n3  Available at www.uncrd.or.jp/env/est/regional_est_forum/first_regional_est_forum_top.htm. \n4 AQM includes the measurement of air quality through air quality monitoring; evaluation of air quality data; \nformulation of air quality improvement strategies; and prevention or control of emissions from mobile, stationary, \nand area sources. \n5  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 2 September 2005. \n6  Available at www.cleanairnet.org/evaluation. \n7  The briefing paper and graphs compiled by CAI-Asia on air quality trends are available at \nwww.cleanairnet.org/caiasia/1412/article-59689.html. \n8  CAI-Asia receives funding from development agencies and its private sector members. Development agencies \nfund CAI-Asia projects such as the Partnership for Sustainable Urban Transport in Asia, cofinanced by the \nSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and the Shell Foundation. The private sector \nmembers pay annual membership fees. Information on CAI-Asia, its membership, and its activities is available at \nwww.cleanairnet.or/caiasia.  \n ", " \n2  Appendix 1 \nefforts to set up its organizational structure, and activities were mostly aimed at knowledge \nmanagement, capacity building, and advocacy of the need to develop and implement integrated \nAQM strategies. A number of pilot programs aimed to generate new knowledge on air pollution, \nits impact, and its management.9 In the second phase (2005\u20132007), attention will shift to (i) \nstrengthening the implementation of AQM programs, (ii) promoting preventive approaches to \nmanage air pollution, and (iii) strengthening local ownership for and involvement in AQM.10  \n \n6.  This TA builds on several ADB projects.11 The main lessons learned from them are that \n(i) real and lasting improvements in urban air quality require policy changes and supportive \ninvestment projects; (ii) local multisector networks of stakeholders are important to promote \nownership and implementation of AQM policies, and to ensure continuity of AQM efforts initiated \nor  catalyzed  by  AQM  investment  projects;  and  (iii)  policy  reforms  in  AQM  are  long-term \nprocesses  and  require  substantial  local  awareness  raising,  knowledge  management,  and \nstakeholder networking. \n \n7.  While  ADB  has  developed  a  strong  profile  in  addressing  water  and  solid  waste \nmanagement, it has provided only limited support for AQM and sustainable urban transport. \nADB must develop a more balanced approach to improving the urban environment, with greater \nattention to urban AQM. Multilateral development organizations such as ADB are well placed to \nprovide  lending  and  nonlending  assistance  to  catalyze  the  introduction  of  better  AQM \napproaches  and  environment-friendly  technologies.  The  East  and  Central  Asia  Regional \nDepartment has started to include air quality issues in the PRC road sector, and the Southeast \nAsia Regional Department is implementing the Metro Manila Air Quality Improvement Sector \nDevelopment  Program  and  the  TA  for  Indonesia  for  Preparing  the  Urban  Air  Quality \nImprovement Sector Development Program. Other regional departments will be enabled to \nincorporate air quality components into their loans and TA projects if (i) information on air quality \nand effective air quality interventions is readily available, (ii) institutional responsibilities for AQM \nin DMCs are properly assigned, and (iii) AQM policy frameworks in DMCs are adopted.   \n                                                 \n9  Support was provided through ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance for Clean Air Initiative for Asian Cities. Manila. (TA \n6016-REG, approved on 19 December 2001, for $150,000) and ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Better Air \nQuality Management in Asia. Manila. (TA 6144-REG, approved on 28 November 2003, for $300,000). \n10  The  CAI-Asia  Strategy  (2005\u20132007)  and  the  Business  Plan  (2005\u20132006)  are  available  at \nwww.cleanairnet.org/strategy and www.cleanairnet.org/businessplan. \n11  This TA builds on previous and ongoing work carried out under ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for Action Plans \nReducing Vehicle Emissions. Manila. (TA 5937-REG, approved on 26 September 2000, for $900,000); ADB. 2001. \nTechnical Assistance for Clean Air Initiative for Asian Cities. Manila. (TA 6016-REG, approved on 19 December \n2001, for $150,000); ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the South Asian Subregional Economic Cooperation \nCountries for Regional Air Quality Management. Manila (TA 6159-REG, approved on 19 December 2003, for \n$400,000); and ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to Indonesia for Preparing the Urban Air Quality Improvement \nSector Development Program. Manila (TA 4361-INO, approved on 20 July 2004, for $700,000). TA 5937-REG \nresulted in policy guidelines to reduce vehicle emissions in Asia, and a number of studies and action plans, which \nhave resulted in follow-up action by ADB in Indonesia, and by the United States Asia Environmental Partnership \nprogram in Viet Nam. In other cases, such as the study on compressed natural gas versus ultra-low sulfur diesel in \nMumbai, a substantive impact was made on shaping the policy debate on this topic. TA 6016-REG established \nCAI-Asia, which is co-funded by 10 private sector firms. A website has been set up and a successful internet-based \ndiscussion group established. CAI-Asia established a capacity-building program\u2014Clean Air Training Network for \nAsia (CATNet-Asia). Four pilot projects have been initiated: (i) Public Health Impact of Air Pollution in Asia, (ii) \nReducing Diesel Emissions in Bangkok, (iii) Cost of Refinery Upgrading for Diesel Refineries in Asia, and (iv) \nPartnership for Sustainable Urban Transport in Asia. TA 6159-REG established a national air quality network in \nNepal and Bhutan; laid the groundwork to establish similar networks in Bangladesh and India; created air quality \ndatabases in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal; and facilitated the formulation of integrated AQM system \nstudies and town-based air quality action plans in all four countries. TA 4361-INO will help prepare the urban air \nquality improvement sector development program to strengthen enforcement strategies and the framework of \nurban AQM in Indonesia. \n \n ", "  3\n \n8.  Previous efforts to strengthen AQM in Asia focused mostly on local sources of air \npollution. Evidence increasingly points to the link between local, national, regional, and global \nair pollution.12 Urban AQM will need to take account of the impact of transboundary air pollution \non cities\u2019 air quality.13 The potential links between efforts to improve regional and local urban air \nquality must be fully optimized. Growing awareness of the impacts of climate change could \nstrengthen AQM. Many conventional pollutants such as carbon monoxide and black carbon \nworsen urban air pollution and global warming. A co-benefit approach, which combines efforts \nto  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  local  urban  air  pollution,  can  obtain  additional \nresources for and greater acceptance of AQM policies and measures. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The TA supports efforts by countries and cities in Asia to improve AQM.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The project impact will be stabilized air pollution levels in major Asian cities, with some \ncities improving air quality for selected parameters.14 The project will help local, national, and \nregional organizations stabilize or partly improve air quality over the next 5 years. Improvements \nin air quality are expected to be mostly for TSP, PM , and SO . Ozone (O ) and oxides of \n10 2 3\nnitrogen (NOx and NO ) are not expected to improve because Asian cities are motorizing \n2\nrapidly, and stabilizing these pollutants at current levels can be considered a positive result.15   \n \n11.  The expected outcome will be the better integration of AQM into the strategies, policies, \nprograms,  and  projects  of  DMCs  and  development  agencies  such as  ADB.  This  outcome \nreflects the project\u2019s orientation toward two main groups of clients: (i) decision makers in DMCs \nresponsible  for  planning  and  implementing  AQM  policies,  programs,  and  projects;  and  (ii) \ndevelopment agencies, which are important partners for DMCs in strengthening AQM. The \nproject outcome will have been achieved if (i) the status and importance (relevant inclusion and \nmainstreaming)  of  AQM  in  strategy,  policy,  and  regulatory  documents  of  DMCs  and \ndevelopment agencies have increased;16 (ii) more AQM-related programs and projects are \nsupported by bilateral and multilateral agencies than in 2000\u20132004; and (iii) ADB engagement in \nAQM-related topics upon TA completion is greater than in 2000\u20132004. \n \n                                                 \n12 WHO. 2004. Report  on  the  WHO/UNEP/ADB  High-Level  Meeting  on  Health  and  Environment  in  ASEAN  \nand  East  Asian  Countries.  Available:  http://www.wpro.who.int/NR/rdonlyres/B4F13E59-1008-451A-ABB6-\n6F2B951F8BA8/0/High_Level_Meeting.pdf. \n13 Emissions from regional air pollutants such as sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, ammonia, tropospheric ozone, heavy \nmetals, black carbon, and persistent organic pollutants give rise both to local impacts and also regional effects after \nlong-range transport. It is encouraging to know that efforts are under way, coordinated by UNEP, to develop \nregional approaches and agreements to prevent or reduce transboundary air pollution. \n14 The TA will target the following priority countries: Bhutan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and \nViet Nam. Local AQM networks in PRC, Indonesia, and Philippines are expected to take part in the TA\u2019s capacity \nbuilding and coordination activities. \n15  A  briefing  paper  and  graphs  compiled  by  CAI-Asia  on  air  quality  trends  are  available  at \nwww.cleanairnet.org/caiasia/1412/article-59689.html.  \n16 \u201cMainstreaming\u201d means that AQM is reflected in policies and strategies of development agencies and, where \nappropriate, becomes part of country strategies and of the lending and nonlending pipeline. \n ", " \n4  Appendix 1 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will have two main outputs, which are linked: (i) AQM knowledge management \nsystems  institutionalized,  and  capacity  and  networking  for  AQM  strengthened  regionally, \nnationally, and locally;17 and (ii) more AQM activities in DMCs and development agencies, and \nstrengthened  implementation  of  AQM  programs  and  projects.  Knowledge  collected  and \norganized under the first output as well as the capacity generated through the local networks will \nbe mobilized to develop and implement additional AQM activities in the second output. This \napproach supports the 2005\u20132007 strategy of CAI-Asia, which also emphasizes the need to \nfocus more on implementing AQM policies and projects.18 \n \n13.  The key activities include (i) drafting project concept papers and proposals for ADB and \nother potential financing institutions and developing a pipeline of AQM projects; (ii) developing \nor updating AQM strategies in partnership with CAI-Asia local networks; (iii) facilitating policy \ndialogue on AQM; (iv) establishing the Environment Knowledge Hub (eKH) in cooperation with \nthe  United  Nations  Environment  Programme  (UNEP);  (v)  benchmarking  AQM  capability  in \nselected Asian cities; and (vi) mainstreaming AQM in ADB and other development agencies\u2019 \noperations (e.g., country strategies, lending and nonlending operations). The activities planned \nfor each output are listed in Appendix 1. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The budget for the project is $655,000. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Finland and \nadministered by ADB.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will start in December 2005 and run for 18 months. The TA will be executed by \nADB  through  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  (RSDD).  ADB  will \ncoordinate closely with CAI-Asia in implementing the TA.19 A team, headed by the Environment \nand  Social  Safeguard  Division  of  RSDD,  will  coordinate  with  the  restructured  energy, \nenvironment, governance, health, regional cooperation, and transport committees in ADB;20 the \nregional  departments;  and  resident  missions  in  DMCs  where  the  TA  will  implement  AQM \nprojects.  \n \n16.  The  TA  will  focus  on  selected  cities  and  countries  in  Asia  faced  with  air  pollution \nproblems and willing to (i) share air quality data and related information with the eKH; (ii) adopt \na multisector approach, working with different sectors to develop, update, or implement AQM \nstrategies; and (iii) invest their own resources to set up or strengthen an AQM system. \n                                                 \n17 CAI-Asia has been helping UNEP develop the Environment Knowledge Hub (eKH). The eKH is proposed to be a \nvirtual focal point, a storehouse of information about the environment in Asia and the Pacific region. UNEP is \ncollaborating with other partners on its five major components: air, biodiversity, energy, land, and water. The CAI-\nAsia secretariat, hosted by ADB, has been tapped as the main partner for the air component. AQM knowledge \nmanagement will be institutionalized nationally and locally through the local CAI-Asia networks. \n18  The  CAI-Asia  strategy  for  2005\u20132007  (http://www.cleaniarnet.org/strategy)  focuses  CAI-Asia\u2019s  efforts  on  (i) \nstrengthening the implementation of AQM programs, (ii) promoting preventive approaches to manage air pollution, \nand (iii) strengthening local ownership for and involvement in AQM.  \n19 A founding member of CAI-Asia, ADB hosts the CAI-Asia secretariat in its headquarters in Manila, Philippines. The \nindividual consultants engaged to implement the TA will form part of the CAI-Asia secretariat in ADB. \n20 These restructured committees are part of the recently established communities of practice, which aim to improve \nsectoral and thematic coordination across departments. \n ", "  5\n \n17.  To ensure coordination and synergy with AQM activities of other major multilateral and \nbilateral  organizations  and  to  promote  the  sustainability  of  individual  project  activities  and \noutputs, partnerships will be developed with international organizations such as UNEP, United \nNations Centre for Regional Development (UNCRD), and World Bank.21 \n  \n18.  To promote participation by all local stakeholders, especially local governments, and to \nenhance ownership of the policies and project concepts developed, ADB will cooperate with the \nlocal multisector networks established by CAI-Asia. The local networks involve all sectors, \nincluding local governments. They perform important roles in (i) information management, (ii) \ncapacity  building,  (iii)  regional  policies  and  standards,  (iv)  pilot  projects,  (v)  formulation  of \nnational AQM strategy, and (vi) national and regional workshops on AQM. These networks have \nbeen established in PRC, Indonesia, Nepal, Philippines, and Sri Lanka; networks are being \nestablished  in  Pakistan  and  Viet  Nam.22  In  2006,  CAI-Asia  plans  to  establish  more  local \nnetworks in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Malaysia, Mongolia, and Thailand.  \n \n19.  The TA results will be disseminated through the CAI-Asia website, which has about \n1,300 visitors per day, and the CAI-Asia listserv, an e-mail discussion forum on AQM with more \nthan 700 subscribers. The TA results will be communicated to the countries covered by the TA \nduring  regular  meetings  of  CAI-Asia,  such  as  those  of  the  executive  council,  the  general \nassembly, and the workshops on better air quality. The interim results of project activities will be \npresented at the workshop on better air quality 2006 in Yogyakarta, Indonesia.  \n \n20.  The TA requires international consultant inputs in institutional development and AQM for \n12 person-months, and domestic consultant inputs for a total of 80 person-months in local \nnetwork  development,  AQM  and  co-benefits,  sustainable  urban  transport,  knowledge \nmanagement, and stationary sources. An outline of the terms of reference is in Appendix 3. The \nconsultants will form part of the CAI-Asia secretariat hosted by ADB. The consultants will be \nengaged by ADB as individuals in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by \nAsian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $655,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Government of Finland for Rolling Out Air Quality Management in Asia, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n21 Examples of these are the envisaged cooperation with UNEP on the establishment of the eKH, which will help \ninstitutionalize the knowledge management activities on AQM, and cooperation with UNCRD on developing \nnational policy frameworks for sustainable urban transport. \n22 For more information on CAI-Asia local networks, please visit http://www.cleanairnet.org/localnetworks. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nAir pollution levels have  \u2022  Improvements of up  \u2022 CAI-Asia, UNEP, eKH   \u2022  AQM sufficiently \nstabilized in major  to 10% in air quality  prioritized by local and \nAsian cities, with some  trends for SO , TSP,  national governments \n2\nimproving air quality for  PM  compared to   \n10\nselected parameters  2005.
