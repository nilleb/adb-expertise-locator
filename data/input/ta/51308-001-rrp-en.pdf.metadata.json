THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor: Power Sector Investment Project. The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Institutional Capacity Building of Tamil \nNadu Transmission Corporation Limited (TANTRANSCO), and if the Board approves the proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The  proposed  project  will  strengthen  power  transmission  connectivity  between  the \nsouthern part of the Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor (CKIC) and the northern part of the \nCKIC by augmenting the 765 kilovolt (kV) and 400 kV networks. This will allow more power \nincluding renewable energy to be evacuated from new generation facilities in the south CKIC to \nthe  energy  hungry  north  CKIC.  The  project  will  also  enhance  the  institutional  capacity  of \nTANTRANSCO by (i) supporting the implementation of a financial restructuring plan (FRP) to \nrestore the financial sustainability of TANTRANSCO; (ii) facilitating the introduction of gender \nsensitive  workplace  practices;  and  (iii)  building  TANTRANSCO\u2019s  capacity  to  monitor  the \nenvironmental and social impacts of power transmission projects. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Government development policies. In 2018, Tamil Nadu had the second largest economy \namong Indian states with a gross domestic product of $250 billion. Industry accounts for a relatively \nhigh share of the state economy of 34%, compared with 26% for the national economy. Services \naccount for 53% of the state economy, dominated by information technology; exports of services \nfrom the state totaled $15 billion in 2018. The agriculture sector accounted for 13% of the state \neconomy. State gross domestic product growth averaged 7% annually over 2014\u20132018.1 \n \n4.  The Government of Tamil Nadu has identified availability of quality infrastructure including \na reliable power supply, as a key prerequisite for further economic development of the state. The \nstate  government  is  also  committed  to  developing  industrial  corridors  to  link  industrial  and \ncommercial hubs such as Chennai and Coimbatore with less developed rural areas to promote \nbalanced development and poverty alleviation in rural areas. In this context, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) has been assisting the state government in developing the CKIC as a key component \nof the state\u2019s economic development strategy. The CKIC covers 23 of the state\u2019s 32 districts and \n70% of the state population.2 \n \n5.  The Government of Tamil Nadu is prioritizing the Chennai\u2013Tiruchirappalli area in the \nnorthern part of CKIC for development of the manufacturing industry, while targeting the Madurai\u2013\nThoothukudi area in the southern part of the CKIC for development of renewable energy-based \npower generation because of the availability of wind and solar resources. Although Tamil Nadu has \na relatively low incidence of poverty compared with the rest of the country, scarce water resources \nand arid conditions contribute to relatively high incidences of poverty in the southernmost districts \n \n1  PRS Legislative Research. Tamil Nadu Budget Analysis 2019\u20132020. (accessed 19 February 2019). \n2  ADB. 2019. Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor Comprehensive Development Plan Main Report. Manila. \n ", "2 \n \nof the CKIC.3 Development of renewable energy in the relatively poor southern districts will \ncontribute to poverty alleviation, economic development, and employment creation.  \n6.  State government energy sector strategy. Tamil Nadu, which accounts for nearly 9% of \ntotal electricity sales in India, is the third largest electricity consuming state in the country. As of \nMarch 2019, Tamil Nadu had installed generation capacity of 30,024 megawatts (MW), including \n8,367 MW of wind power capacity and 2,444 MW of solar power capacity. Tamil Nadu has the \nhighest installed renewable energy capacity among Indian states\u2014renewable energy contributed \nto 23% of the state\u2019s total generation requirement as of March 2019.4 \n \n7.  Tamil  Nadu  has  achieved  100%  household  electrification.  Per-capita  electricity \nconsumption in the state was about 1,372 kilowatts (kW) in fiscal year (FY) 2019, higher than \nIndia\u2019s national average of 1,075 kW, mainly driven by high electricity usage by industries. It is \nexpected that industry and commercial enterprises will account for most of the future growth in \nelectricity demand. Because of its success in developing its rich renewable energy resources. \nTamil Nadu has become an energy-surplus state. The state government is keen to position Tamil \nNadu as an exporter of electricity through the interstate transmission network to meet other states\u2019 \ndemand for power. \n \n8.  It is expected that peak demand for electricity in Tamil Nadu will reach 25,000 MW by \n2025, from 15,487 MW as of March 2019. The state government\u2019s Vision Tamil Nadu document \nenvisages generation capacity reaching 50,000 MW by 2025, up from 30,024 MW as of March \n2019.5 This will involve adding 10,000 MW of wind and solar power capacity during 2019\u20132025. It \nis expected that Tamil Nadu will make a significant contribution to helping India achieve the national \ntarget of adding 175,000 MW of renewable energy capacity by 2022 under India\u2019s commitment to \nthe  United  Nations  Framework  for  Climate  Change.  The  state  government  has  identified \nstrengthening the power transmission grid with adequate redundancy (spare capacity) as being vital \nto integrating large-scale renewable capacity with the power grid. \n \n9.  The state government unbundled the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB)6 in 2010 to form \ntwo separate state-owned companies: (i) Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation \nLimited  (TANGEDCO),  responsible  for  generation  and  distribution;  and  (ii)  TANTRANSCO, \nresponsible for transmission. The main objective of the unbundling was to enhance the commercial \norientation of power utilities and improve their corporate governance. As the sole transmission \nlicensee of the state, TANTRANSCO owns and operates the transmission network at voltages in \nthe range of 110 kV\u2013765 kV. \n \n10.  The state government established the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission \n(TNERC) in 1999 to facilitate tariff-setting on sound economic principles. However, the state \ngovernment has continued to set the tariffs for several consumer segments (farmers and poor \nhouseholds) below cost-recovery levels on socioeconomic grounds, contributing the difference to \n \n3  The percentage of people living below the poverty line in India is 21.9% (2012), while for Tamil Nadu the figure is \n11.9% (2012). However, in terms of highest poverty incidence, the southern district of Ramanthanpuram is ranked \n9th (with rural poverty incidence of 17.8% in 2012) out of 32 districts in Tamil Nadu.

Vision Tamil Nadu: Strategic Plan for Infrastructure Development in Tamil Nadu. \nChennai. \n6  TNEB remains as the holding company of TANGEDCO and TANTRANSCO.  \n ", "3 \nTANGEDCO as a revenue subsidy. However, these revenue subsidies have not been sufficient \nto meet the gap between the approved tariff for subsidized consumers and the cost of supply. \n \n11.  The state government absorbed TANGEDCO\u2019s liabilities of \u20b9230 billion ($3.5 billion) in \n2017 as part of the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) scheme promoted by the central \ngovernment.7 TANGEDCO has committed to improving its commercial and financial performance \nin return for debt relief provided by the state government, and has committed to eliminating the \ngap between  cost of supply  and aggregate revenues realized (including for approved revenue \nsubsidies). However, progress to date has not been satisfactory mainly because of delays in filing \nfor annual tariff revisions by TANGEDCO. The state government has assured that submissions \nwould be made for tariff revisions to TNERC on annual basis starting FY2021. \n \n12.  Transmission constraints to be addressed. The districts in the southern CKIC are \nexpected to contribute 9,000 MW of added generation capacity during FY2019\u20132025. This \nincludes 6,000 MW of renewable energy capacity, of which 2,060 MW are under construction as \nof March 2019. The existing transmission network capacity is inadequate to reliably evacuate \npower from these new renewable-energy-based plants in the southern CKIC. \n \n13.  As the demand for electricity and supply of renewable energy increase, the frequency and \nduration of curtailment of renewable-energy-based plants are likely to increase in the absence of \na strengthened transmission network. This may deter further development of renewable energy \nin the region. This may also result in suboptimal operation of the power system (i.e., continuing \nto operate more expensive thermal power plants while curtailing the use of cheaper renewable \nenergy sources). Therefore, in the absence of a strengthened transmission network, the economic \ncost of supplying electricity would increase, and greenhouse gas emissions would rise. \n \n14.  The  project  will  establish  an  extra-high-voltage  (765  kV)  transmission  link  between \nVirudhunagar and Coimbatore to transfer the expected added generation capacity of 9,000 MW \nby 2025 in the southern CKIC to Coimbatore, which is a major industrial center. The project also \nincludes the construction of a 400 kV/230 kV pooling substation at Ottapidaram and associated \n400 kV transmission lines to pool power generated at renewable and thermal power plants in \nThoothukudi  District  in the  southern  CKIC  and  transmit  that  power to  the  765 kV/400  kV \nVirudhunagar substation. TANTRANSCO considered several alternative network configurations \nto meet the expected demand for transmission capacity and verified through engineering studies \nthat the proposed solution is the optimum design configuration. \n \n15.  Restoring  the financial  sustainability  of Tamil  Nadu Transmission  Corporation \nLimited. The project also seeks to restore the financial viability of TANTRANSCO by addressing \nlegacy issues emanating from the allocation of liabilities and accumulated losses of the TNEB to \nits  successor  entities  (TANTRANSCO  and  TANGEDCO)  during  the  unbundling  process. \nTANTRANSCO has been allocated a disproportionate share of liabilities of TNEB that were \naccrued for financing cash-flow deficits and recurrent losses before 2010. \n \n16.  These loans have no corresponding transmission assets, hence, TNERC has not allowed \nTANTRANSCO  to  recover  debt  service  cost  of  these  loans  through  transmission  tariffs. \nTANTRANSCO has been compelled to borrow from commercial sources to bridge the resultant \ncash-flow deficit. Consequently, TANTRANSCO has fallen into a debt trap whereby it is compelled \n \n7  Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana is the financial turnaround and revival package for electricity distribution \ncompanies (DISCOMs) initiated by the Government of India to find a permanent solution to improving the weak \nfinancial status of DISCOMs.  \n ", "4 \n \nto keep borrowing more money to service its debt yet lacks additional revenue sources to recoup \nits debt-service obligations. \n \n17.  Another issue is that TANTRANSCO has not been able to contribute 30% of its capital \nexpenditures as equity (30% is the expected equity contribution in transmission tariff methodology \nadopted by TNERC). Therefore, the depreciation provision allowed in transmission tariff by \nTNERC is not adequate to meet the debt service payments. As of 31 March 2019, the total \nunsustainable  liabilities  (to  external  creditors)  that  TANTRANSCO  cannot  service  through \ntransmission tariffs was estimated to be \u20b957.3 billion ($806 million). \n \n18.  During project preparation, ADB assisted the government of Tamil Nadu in preparing a \nfinancial restructuring plan (FRP) to address this long-standing issue and restore the financial \nviability of TANTRANSCO. The project administration manual (PAM) describes the FRP and the \ndraft loan agreement reflects key aspects of FRP as covenants.8 \n \n19.  The FRP consists of the following key features: (i) an equity injection from the government \nof Tamil Nadu over 3 years starting from FY2021 to settle the unsustainable liabilities owed to \nexternal creditors; (ii) adjusting intercompany liabilities owed to TANGEDCO; (iii) extending the \nrepayment  period  of  TANTRANSCO\u2019s  remaining  loans  to  12  years;  (iv)  rationalizing \nTANTRANSCO\u2019s future annual capital expenditures to ensure 30% of capital expenditure is \nfinanced with equity and internal cash generation; and (v) filing petitions for annual transmission \ntariff revisions with the TNERC. \n \n20.  Implementation of the FRP will enable TANTRANSCO to reach financial viability by 2024. \nIn addition to supporting the FRP, the financial management action plan (FMAP) described in the \nPAM recommends several measures to improve corporate governance. The attached technical \nassistance (TA) will support these measures.9 Implementation of the FRP and the FMAP will \nensure that TANTRANSCO will become financially viable and will be able to finance its capital \nexpenditures beyond 2024 using commercial sources and internal cash generation, without \nrequiring government equity support. \n \n21.  Alignment  with  Strategy  2030.  The  project  is  closely  aligned  with  the  operational \npriorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 to (i) tackle climate change and promote renewable energy by \nimproving transmission connectivity from the renewable-resource-rich southwest region of Tamil \nNadu to load centers in Chennai and Coimbatore; (ii) strengthen governance and institutional \ncapacity through implementation of the FRP and the FMAP; and (iii) promote gender-sensitive \nworkplace practices and enhanced career opportunities for female staff.10 \n \n22.  ADB  value  addition.  Because  of  legacy  issues  related  to  the  establishment  of \nTANGEDCO and TANTRANSCO, both companies are saddled with unsustainable levels of debt. \nThe government of Tamil Nadu has shown a keen interest to collaborate with ADB to resolve this \nissue. ADB has engaged in high-level policy dialogue with the Government of Tamil Nadu to \nrestore the financial viability of TANTRANSCO in a fiscally sustainable manner. ADB assisted the \nGovernment of Tamil Nadu to develop a comprehensive FRP, to be implemented with ADB \nsupport under this project.  \n \n8  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10 ADB. 2018.

TANTRANSCO, the executing agency, has yet to gain experience in commissioning and \noperating 765 kV transmission assets, although it is one of the few state utilities in India authorized \nto invest in this type of asset. ADB has financed 765 kV transmission lines and substations \nimplemented  by  the  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India.11 The  project  incorporates  ADB\u2019s \nexperience  and  lessons  learned  through  those  projects  with  respect  to  technical  design, \ncontract management, and safeguard issues including accurately aligning transmission line \nroutes at the outset to minimize safeguard-related issues during project implementation. ADB \nwill use satellite technology to ensure the accuracy of the transmission line alignment and \nminimize environmental and social impacts. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n24.  The project is aligned with the following impact: industrial development and renewable \nenergy utilization in Tamil Nadu enhanced (footnote 5). The project will have the following \noutcome: power supply in the CKIC increased in a financially sustainable manner.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n25.  Output 1: Transmission link from southern Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor \nto load centers in northern Chennai\u2013Kanyakumari Industrial Corridor established.

Output 3: Financial and institutional capacity of Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation \nLimited improved. This output will (i) assist TANTRANSCO in implementing the FRP to restore \nits financial sustainability; (ii) support the implementation of the financial management action plan \n(FMAP)  to  improve  the  financial  management  capacity  and  corporate  governance  of \nTANTRANSCO; (iii) facilitate the introduction of gender-sensitive workplace practices within \nTANTRANSCO; and (iv) enhance the capacity of TANTRANSCO to monitor the environmental \nand  social  impacts  of  transmission  projects.

Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $131.9 million and climate adaptation is estimated \nto cost $24.5 million. ADB will finance 100% of mitigation costs and 100% of adaptation costs.13 \nThe climate mitigation finance was estimated based on the share of renewable energy transmitted \nby the project financed transmission assets. The climate adaptation cost is estimated based on \nthe incremental cost of transmission lines to withstand higher wind speeds (wind zone 4).  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n32.  The government of Tamil Nadu will execute the project, acting through TANTRANSCO, \nthe  state-owned  transmission  utility.  As  the  executing  agency  and  implementing  agency, \nTANTRANSCO will have overall responsibility for executing the investment project and for its day-\nto-day implementation. The Government of India will channel the ADB loan proceeds to the \ngovernment  of  Tamil  Nadu,  which  will  then  on-lend  those  funds  to  TANTRANSCO.  The \ngovernment  of  Tamil  Nadu  is  also  expected  to  make  counterpart  funds  available  to \nTANTRANSCO  as  equity  investments  to  augment  TANTRANSCO\u2019s  capital  base.  The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM \n(footnote 8).  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2019\u2013December 2024 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2024 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2025 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Department of Energy, Government of Tamil Nadu; and Board of \nDirectors, TANTRANSCO \n(ii)  Executing agency  TANTRANSCO \n(iii) Implementing agency  TANTRANSCO \n(iv) Implementation unit  TANTRANSCO\u2019s Head Office in Chennai is responsible for \nContract Management.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n33.  The proposed transaction TA will finance output 3 of the project. At the government\u2019s \nrequest, TANTRANSCO will be the executing agency and implementing agency for the TA. The TA \nwill be implemented over 24 months from 1 December 2019 to 30 November 2021 (footnote 9).  \n \n34.  The TA will (i) support implementation of the FRP and the FMAP by providing financial \nanalysis expertise to TANTRANSCO, and supporting the preparation of a gap analysis of existing \naccounting practices and the requirements for adoption of Indian Accounting Standards; (ii) \nsupport TANTRANSCO to undertake a needs assessment to identify interventions to make \nTANTRANSCO a more gender-sensitive workplace, and support implementation and monitoring \nof some of these measures; and (iii) enhance the capacity of TANTRANSCO to monitor the \nsafeguard aspects of transmission investment projects, including investments under the project. \n \n35.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000, of which $650,000 will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  TANTRANSCO  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space and other in-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n36.  ADB staff undertook due diligence of the project to establish the need for proposed \ntransmission network strengthening in the context of expected additions of new generation \ncapacity in the southern CKIC and the anticipated demand increase in the northern CKIC. \nTANTRANSCO  Planning  Department  undertook  power  system  studies  to  assess  different \nnetwork configurations and identify the least-cost option of providing transmission connectivity \nbetween the southern and northern CKIC. The Central Electricity Authority of India has reviewed \nand approved the technical substation designs, including the addition of shunt reactors to maintain \nvoltages at desired levels during low-load periods. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n37.  The transmission pricing regime (the aggregate revenue requirement approach) in India \nand in Tamil Nadu is based on the cost-plus principle which means that tariffs are based on all \neligible costs of the transmission utility plus a reasonable return on portion of equity financing of \ncapital investments. As TNERC has approved the project as an eligible capital investment project, \nits financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is guaranteed under the prevailing regulatory regime. \nThe FIRR does not depend on utilization levels (i.e. actual power flow of transmission assets \nfunded under the project or an approved capital cost increase by the regulator). On this basis, the \nestimated FIRR of the project is 3.3%, compared with the project\u2019s weighted average cost of \ncapital of 2.98%. ADB staff performed an analysis to assess the sensitivity of the FIRR to adverse \nchanges in key variables, including (i) capital cost increase not allowed by the regulator; (ii) \nincrease in operation and maintenance costs; and (iii) delay in project completion. The results of ", "9 \nthe sensitivity analysis confirmed that the project\u2019s financial viability is robust under likely adverse \nscenarios.14 \n \n38.   ADB staff conducted the economic analysis of the project in accordance with ADB \nguidelines. The analysis evaluated the costs and benefits in FY2019 constant prices for a period \nof 29 years starting from FY2019 until FY2047. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was \ncalculated  by  comparing  the  with-project  and  without-project  scenarios.  The  project  is \neconomically viable with an EIRR of 13.47%, and the project\u2019s expected net present value is \n$2.38 billion at an economic discount rate of 9% per year. The sensitivity of the EIRR was \nassessed with respect to the scenarios considered for the FIRR, plus a reduction in renewable \nand thermal generation capacity. The results of the sensitivity analysis are described in the \neconomic analysis and confirmed that the project\u2019s economic viability is robust under likely \nadverse scenarios.15 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n39.  The financial management risk is substantial mainly because of corporate governance \nissues with respect to the project  executing agency (TANTRANSCO). These relate to (i) \nconcerns about its financial viability (paras. 15\u201317); (ii) the absence of independent directors; \nand (iii) the absence of an internal auditor. The FRP to be implemented by the end of FY2024 \nwill restore the financial viability of TANTRANSCO. The government and TANTRANSCO have \nagreed to appoint an internal auditor by the end of FY2020 to improve corporate governance. \n \n40.  TANTRANSCO operates under a robust legislative framework and is subject to annual \naudits by the comptroller and auditor general of Tamil Nadu. Its operations and tariffs are \nregulated by TNERC, and it has experience with the disbursement and procurement processes \nand  procedures  of  international  development  agencies  such  as  the  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency  and  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW.  However,  ADB \nassessed the overall pre-mitigation financial management risk of TANTRANSCO as substantial \nbecause of low levels of computerization and automation in accounting and financial reporting, \nsubstantial unreconciled interunit and intercompany balances, the lack of a completed fixed \nassets registry, and a weak internal audit system. \n \n41.   ADB and TANTRANSCO have agreed upon a time bound FMAP, as described in the \nPAM  and  the  financial  management  assessment.16 The  FMAP  will  mitigate  the  financial \nmanagement risk.  ADB has prepared a separate project financial management manual to \nimprove the financial management of proceeds of ADB loan funds. \n \n42.  TANTRANSCO  has  well  developed  procurement  systems  which  comply  with  its  own \nprocurement policy as well as the Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998, the Tamil Nadu \nTransparency in Tenders Rules, 2000, and the Government of India\u2019s General Financial Rules, \n2005. It has experienced professionals in its Transmission (Electrical) and Transmission (Civil) \nDepartments who have extensive experience in delivering projects of similar size and complexity \nusing Open Competitive Bidding (OCB). The existing procurement processes are governed by \nregulations that require robust documentation which are archived and easily accessed and has \nthe capability to provide data to support contract negotiations, dispute resolutions, and required \n \n14 The results of the sensitivity analysis are in the Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n15 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \naudits. The existing procurement processes and systems in place are considered adequate to \nsatisfy any Asian Development Bank (ADB) requirements with only minor adjustments.  The \nprocurement activities under the project have been substantially completed and the overall \nprocurement risk is assessed to be \u201cmoderate\u2019.  \n \n43.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time to time) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and TANTRANSCO. ADB undertook integrity due diligence and \nthere were no adverse findings. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM. TANTRANSCO will consult ADB\u2019s Standard Bidding Document for the \nProcurement of Plant\u2014Design, Supply, and Installation to ensure value-for-money in procurement. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n44.  The project will contribute to the overall economic development of the state by ensuring a \nmore reliable, more competitive power supply for industry and services. This will in turn spur \ninclusive economic growth by generating employment and improving livelihoods. The project will \npromote renewable energy development in an underdeveloped region of the state. \n \n45.  Gender. The project is classified as having some gender elements. It presents limited \nopportunities for gender mainstreaming because of the nature of the project. However, gender-\nfocused discussions undertaken at TANTRANSCO indicate that scope exists to introduce gender-\nfriendly working conditions and practices at the utility, particularly in its field offices. These may \ninclude but not be limited to workplace facilities that respond to gender-based needs, including \nseparate and convenient lavatories, resting rooms, and recreation and medical facilities for women. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n46.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.17 \n \n47.  Environment (category B). The project is categorized as environmental category B as \nthe project will not pass through any environmentally or ecologically sensitive area. Following \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  TANTRANSCO  has  prepared  an  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE), including an environmental management plan to minimize adverse impacts \nduring project construction and operation. The technical design ensures that the electromagnetic \nfields are within safe limits at the ground level. There are no associated facilities as per the \ndefinition of associated facilities in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Induced impacts because \nof power generation capacity additions in the project impact areas are described in the IEE. \nTANTRANSCO has undertaken meaningful consultations with communities in the project impact \nareas.  The  IEE  has  been  disclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  website.  Although  TANTRANSCO  has  the \ninstitutional  capacity  and  experience  to  manage  environmental  risks  through  its  General \nConstruction Circle (GCC) Madurai, ADB will provide additional capacity building support through \nthe  attached  TA.  If  unanticipated  environmental  and  resettlement  impacts  occur  during \nimplementation, TANTRANSCO will prepare a corrective action plan or update the IEE and/or \nenvironment management plan to address and mitigate the issues. The GCC will supervise, \nmonitor, audit, and report to ADB through semiannual environmental monitoring reports. \n \n \n17  ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. Manila.  \n ", "11 \n48.  Involuntary resettlement (category B).  TANTRANSCO has carefully designed the \nsubstations and transmission line alignments to avoid all structures and minimize land acquisition \nand involuntary resettlement. The substations will be built on land owned by TANTRANSCO and \nwill not involve land acquisition. The 522 kilometres of project transmission lines will have mostly \ntemporary impacts but will also have permanent impacts on trees and tower footprints. No \nhouseholds  will  be  physically  displaced  or  lose  10%  or  more  of their  productive (income-\ngenerating) assets. TANTRANSCO has prepared a resettlement plan in compliance with Indian \nregulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \nMitigation  measures  and  budgetary  provisions  are  in  place  to  provide  compensation  at \nreplacement cost, commensurate to the impacts, and to restore livelihoods. TANTRANSCO will \nmonitor implementation of the resettlement plan and submit semiannual monitoring reports to ADB. \n \n49.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project area is not inhabited by indigenous \npopulations therefore, the project will not impact indigenous peoples. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n50.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.18 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nUnexpected fiscal constraints and  Approval of the FRP and implementation of its key actions are \nchanges in the government of  covenanted in the loan agreement.
