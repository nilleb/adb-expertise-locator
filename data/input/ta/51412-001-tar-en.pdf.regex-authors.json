THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide project preparation support \nand capacity building for two ensuing projects in Mongolia on Developing Cross-Border Economic \nZone (CBEZ) and Regional Improvement of Border Services (Additional Financing). The ensuing \nprojects will support Mongolia\u2019s trade and economic objectives with a focus on developing the \ncountry\u2019s strategic border areas. A similar set of safeguards, financial management, economic, \nand other technical assessments is required. The TA is included in the country operations \nbusiness plan for Mongolia, 2019\u20132021.1  \n \n2.  Development challenges. However, Mongolia\u2019s geographic isolation, vast and sparsely \npopulated  land  area,  and  landlocked  position  pose  substantial  challenges  to  the  country\u2019s \ndevelopment. Inadequate and poorly maintained infrastructure result to high trade and transport \ncosts making Mongolia\u2019s exports uncompetitive. Despite Mongolia\u2019s adoption of a liberal trade \npolicy, weak trade facilitation on Mongolia\u2019s side of the border results in delays and poor supply \nchain management.2 \n \n3.  Government strategy. Recent economic downturn highlighted the need to develop a \nmore resilient and diversified economy that delivers sustainable growth. The TA and its ensuing \nprojects are consistent and aligned with Mongolia\u2019s Sustainable Development Vision 20303 and \nAction Plan of the Government of Mongolia in 2016\u20132020.4 These include actions to: (i) boost the \noperations of free economic zones and support foreign and domestic investments; (ii) promote \ntrade and manufacturing at international trade zones and border port areas; (iii) improve the \nborder  points  and  near  border  infrastructure;  and  (iv)  intensify  economic  integration  and \ninfrastructure networks and create enabling conditions for foreign trade.   \n \n4.  Key problems and issues at the borders. Several border crossing points (BCPs) of \nMongolia are part of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) corridor 4 which \nconnects Mongolia with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Russian Federation (Russia).5 \nHowever, underdeveloped infrastructure and adverse weather during winter impede efficient road \ntransport along the routes. In 2017, the Corridor Performance Measurement and Monitoring \n(CPMM) Report documented that inbound traffic at the Zamyn-Uud BCP coming from Tianjin in \nPRC takes more than a day to cross the border. Waiting due to shortage of railway wagons, \nmarshalling, transfer of materials and technical inspection contribute to the delay. Meanwhile, \ninfrastructure, facilities and equipment at two strategic BCPs identified by the Government, \nnamely, Bichigt bordering the PRC in the East and Borshoo bordering the Russia in the West, are \ncurrently outdated and inadequate to maintain border clearance and immigration protection \nstandards.   \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018.

Ulaanbaatar. \n5  Subcorridor 4a lies in western Mongolia and provides a transit route between the Russian Federation to the PRC.  \nSubcorridor 4b is the most active and covers the key north\u2013south railway of more than 1,000 km, providing an \nimportant transit and import\u2013export route to the PRC. Subcorridor 4c is the route to the east that connects \nUlaanbaatar to Chifeng, a major PRC railway node, and Jinzhou, a seaport in the northeastern region of the PRC. \nThe route is designed to alleviate Mongolia\u2019s sole reliance on Tianjin, the nearest seaport, for its commercial \nshipments.  \n ", "2 \n \n \n5.  As  early  as  1995,  the  Government  introduced  free  zones6 to  promote  economic \ndevelopment in border areas and support Mongolia\u2019s transition into a market economy. However, \nthe three free zones established so far in Altanbulag (Selenge aimag [province]), Zamyn-Uud \n(Dornogobi aimag), and Tsagaannuur (Bayan-Ulgii aimag), have limited or no investment and \noperations. Underdeveloped infrastructure and facilities, weak capacity and poor policy and \nplanning coordination, have weakened the investment attractiveness of these free zones despite \nthe strong political support and strategic locations. \n \n6.  Efforts were sought to reinvigorate and expand the development of the free zones \nincluding through the amendment of the Law of Mongolia on Free Zones in 2015. In April 2018, \nthe Government also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the PRC to develop CBEZ \nwhich covers the free zones of Zamyn-Uud and  Erlian in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. \nSuch zones are increasingly becoming part of economic corridor development among CAREC \ncountries. Furthermore, the Government signed a trilateral plan to develop an economic corridor \nwith the PRC and Russia which aims to strengthen transport, logistics and trade connectivity while \npromoting Mongolia\u2019s position as a transit country.  \n \n7.  Existing and potential regional arrangements further present opportunity to enhance \nMongolia\u2019s linkage with the global and regional value chains. For instance, Mongolia\u2019s exports \nenjoy generalized system of preferences from the European Union and preferential tariffs under \nan economic partnership agreement with Japan.7 Mongolia is considering free trade agreements \nwith the Eurasian Economic Union, the PRC, and Republic of Korea. Mongolia is an active \nmember of regional cooperation and integration (RCI) initiatives such as the CAREC Program \nand the Greater Tumen Initiative.8  \n \n8.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support.  The  Country  Partnership  Strategy  for \nMongolia, 2017\u20132020 emphasizes the need to improve physical connectivity and trade facilitation \nto enhance the competitiveness of the Mongolian economy (footnote 2). Prior and ongoing ADB \ninvestment and technical assistance focused on improving transport connectivity, trade facilitation \nand border management. A regional logistics development project, which was completed and \noperational in October 2018, provides multimodal facilities for road-to-road, road-to-rail, and rail-\nto-rail transshipment and modern customs and quarantine facilities to connect Mongolia\u2019s road \nand rail links in Zamyn-Uud to the PRC.9 An ongoing project aims to improve inspection and \ncontrol systems of Mongolian border authorities (in Dakhan-Uul, Altanbulag, and Zamyn-Uud) to \nincrease agri-food trade;10 while another projects will support the upgrade and improve border \nfacilities and equipment at key BCPs including Altanbulag and Zamyn-Uud.11  \n                                                \n6   Free zone means a part of the territory of Mongolia, deemed to fall outside the customs territory for the purposes of \ncustoms duties and other taxes, adopting a special treatment of business activity (Article 3, The Law of Mongolia on \nFree Zones, as amended and restated on 12 February 2015).  \n7  Under the Japan-Mongolia economic partnership agreement which entered into force in June 2016, 5,700 types of \ngoods from Mongolia and 9,300 types of goods from Japan are exempted or with gradual elimination of customs \nduties. Agricultural products, textiles and leather products, and heavy industrial products from Mongolia also enjoy \npreferential tariff conditions in Japan.  \n8  An  intergovernmental  cooperation  mechanism  among  Mongolia,  the  PRC,  Republic  of  Korea,  and  Russian \nFederation, supported by the United Nations Development Programme. \n9  ADB. 2016.

The ensuing projects to be supported by the TA will not only enhance economic activity in \nMongolia but improve trade and investment linkages with its neighboring countries, particularly, \nwith the PRC and Russia. Such will support implementation of Mongolia\u2019s agreements with the \ntwo countries and as a spillover, promote development of regional value chain within the CAREC \ncorridor 4. Specifically, the CBEZ project will help facilitate the development of export-oriented \nproduction, transport and logistics services in the Mongolia CBEZ in the Zamyn-Uud and improve \ntrade and tourism services with the PRC in Erlian. This TA is also linked to the subproject on \nErlian CBEZ infrastructure development which is part of the proposed RCI projects in the PRC.12  \n \n10.  The Regional Improvement of Border Services project (Additional Financing) will upgrade \nand improve facilities and border equipment at two BCPs, i.e., Bichigt and Borshoo, which are \nanticipated to become increasingly functional gateways for cross-border trade as well as cross-\nborder people-to-people exchanges.  \n \n11.  The TA directly supports the implementation of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priority \nof fostering RCI.13 It is aligned with the framework of CAREC 2030 Strategy14 which aims to \nsupport CAREC countries including Mongolia in integrating further with the global economy \nthrough increased market access, greater diversification, and stronger institutions for trade.15  \n \nB.
