During the 2002 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the \nGovernment  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  confirmed  its  request  for  technical \nassistance  (TA)  to  prepare  an  integrated  roads  development  project  (the  Project)  in  Gansu \nProvince. The Fact-Finding Mission comprising two domestic consultants visited the project area in \nJune and July 2003, carried out an initial poverty and social assessment (IPSA), and collected \nnecessary information. ADB\u2019s Reconnaissance Mission1 was fielded in August 2003 to discuss \nwith the officials of Ministry of Communications , the Gansu Provincial Government, and the Gansu \nProvincial  Communications  Department  the  final  report  and  findings  during  the  Fact-Finding \nMission, and economic, social, and other project-specific issues. This paper is based on the \nunderstandings reached on the objectives, scope, costs, consultants\u2019 term of reference, and \nimplementation arrangements for the TA, and the Mission\u2019s observations in the field. The TA is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s 2003 program for the PRC,2 and proposed loan is included in the 2005 program. \nThe TA framework is attached in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC had about 1.76 million kilometers (km) of roads at the end of 2002. This is the \nworld second largest road network, next to 6.3 million km of roads in the United States. The PRC\u2019s \n25,130 km of the expressway network is also second after the United States (about 88,800 km). \nHowever, the PRC road network is still underdeveloped in quality and size, and the road density is \namong the lowest in the world  (17.7  km  per  100  square  kilometers  [km2]). The  PRC  faces \nconstraints and bottlenecks in road transport. Road networks are poorly developed and do not \nprovide  access  to  large  parts  of  the  country,  particularly  in  the  poorer  inland  regions.  \nVehicle numbers are growing at 2\u20133 times the rate of population, and the urban population has \nincreased from 190 million in 1980 to 360 million in 2001. By 2010, an estimated 700 million \npeople will live in major activity centers. The vehicle and population growth, together with the \nconsiderable  volume  of  slow-moving  nonmotorized  vehicles,  contribute  to  numerous  road \naccidents, hamper traffic flow and cause congestion, and inhibit socioeconomic development. \n \n3.  The Government's policies for the road sector are based on (i) constructing expressways to \nexpand the national trunk highway system (NTHS) and link all cities with a population of more than \n500,000; (ii) developing secondary roads, particularly those that will help reduce poverty in the rural \nareas; and (iii) building roads that will support regional cooperation with neighboring countries in the \nsouthwest, northeast, and northwest. The NTHS is the heart of the road network, a system of \ninterprovincial expressways and highways of about 35,000 km. It will be complemented by the \ndevelopment of national, provincial, county, township, and village roads. Most of the remaining \nNTHS sections will be completed together with 195,000 km of interprovincial highways and 150,000 \nkm of rural roads during the Tenth Five Year Plan (TFYP:2001\u20132005).3 The TFYP will accelerate the \nroad network development on the NTHS and will focus on the major corridors in the western region. \nThe Government views road development as a key component of its strategy to improve access to \nactivity centers and support socioeconomic development particularly in less developed regions with a \nlower road density. The western development strategy  adopted by the Government in February \n20004 will (i) facilitate economic and social development in the western region, (ii) link the western \n                                                 \n1  Due to the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome, ADB staff were banned from traveling in the PRC during the \nfact-finding period. \n2  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 13 May 2002. \n3  ADB assisted the Government in identifying road sector investment and policy reforms in the southwestern PRC \nthrough TA 3086-PRC (ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Regional Road \nSector Study. Manila. \n4  Covering the following 12 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipality: Chongqing, Gansu,  Guizhou, Inner \nMongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Xizang, and Yunnan. The three prefectures included in the \nwestern development strategy are in Hubei, Hunan, and Jilin. ", "2 \nregion with the central and eastern regions, (iii) provide the western region with trade outlets at the \nsouthern and eastern seaports, and (iv) promote regional cooperation with neighboring countries.  \n \n4.  The link between transport development and poverty reduction is generally recognized.5  \nAn ADB-financed study in the southwest region6 concluded that poor quality road infrastructure and \ninadequate transport services in poor areas are major obstacles to economic growth and poverty \nreduction. The greater the road development, the higher the per capita income.7 The Government \nhas been supporting poverty reduction through road sector investments in several ways. First, the \nfocus on NTHS construction has shifted from the east coast to the central and southwest regions, \nwhich have a higher incidence of poverty, and where road density is about 10.5 km/100 km2 \ncompared with 35 km/100 km in the east. Second, the vehicle purchase fee, which has financed \nabout 13% of road sector expenditures, has been allocated largely to financing road investments in \npoorer  provinces.  Third,  Ministry  of  Communications  grants  and  provincial  communications \ndepartment resources supplement local government budgets to improve county and township roads. \nFourth, through the separate budgeting of poverty reduction funds, road improvements are carried \nout to link an increasing number of villages to the road network, with corresponding improvement in \nthe quality of transport services. The Government\u2019s measures and road development objectives will \ncontribute significantly to poverty reduction in the western region. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s overarching objective, poverty reduction, has been emphasized in the road sector. \nThe location of ADB-financed road projects has shifted from the northeast and coastal areas to the \npoorer  central  and  southwest  regions.  Improving  road  infrastructure  will  help  create  an \nenvironment that facilitates economic growth and private sector development in the poorer interior \nprovinces. To enhance poverty reduction impact, the scope of recent road projects has been \nbroadened to integrate local roads with expressways, thus providing better access to poor counties \nand townships. ADB\u2019s operations strategy supports (i) constructing roads that connect major \ngrowth centers and provide access to the western and central regions; (ii) integrating the network \nso that the NTHS is supported by a system of local roads, particularly those that provide access to \npoor areas; (iii) promoting road safety and vehicle emission reductions; (iv) strengthening  the \ncorporatization  and  commercialization  of  expressway  organizations;  (v)  adopting  appropriate \npricing policies to ensure optimum use of road transport capacity; (vi) addressing traffic safety and \nenvironmental issues; and (vii) using alternative methods of investment financing, including private \nsector participation. \n \n6.  Gansu Province is one of the PRC\u2019s five northwest provinces. It is on the upper reaches of \nthe Yellow River and is bordered by Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; Ningxia Hui Autonomous \nRegion;  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous  Region;  and  Qinhai,  Shaanxi,  and  Sichuan  provinces. \nGansu\u2019s eastern part won the Loess Plateau; its western part is in the Hexi Corridor known as the \nancient Silk Road; its southern part is mountainous and its northern part is marked by the Alasan \nPlateau and Badanjilin Desert. Remote and isolated in harsh natural conditions, Gansu is one of \nthe PRC\u2019s least developed provinces. In 2001, Gansu\u2019s per capita gross domestic product (GDP) \nwas CHY4,165, the 30th among the PRC\u2019s 31 provinces and autonomous regions, only 55% of the \nnational average. The average rural per capita income was only CNY1,500\u201463% of the national \naverage of CNY2,366, and 28th among the 31 provinces and autonomous regions. About 50% or \nmore of Gansu\u2019s rural population are living below the poverty line of CNY1,000 per capita per year, \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1998.

Most of the poor are in the Loess Plateau and the mountains, and \nmany of them live in abject poverty in a harsh environment.  \n \n7.  Gansu  has  14  municipalities  and  prefectures  that  further  administer  87  counties  and \ndistricts and 1,660 townships and subdistricts, including 7 autonomous counties and 40 ethnic \nminority townships.  Gansu\u2019s total land area is 454,430 km2, of which 26% mountainous; 29% \nplateau; 30% plain and 15% is Gobi Desert. The total population in 2001 was 25.75 million, and \nabout 9% belonged to minorities. Agriculture is the major economic activity. Of its total population, \n68% are rural residents. The province has relatively rich land resource and the per capita arable \nand mountain land areas of rural Gansu were 0.163 hectares (ha) and 0.047 ha, respectively in \n2001: 123% and 254% of the national averages. Most of major agricultural products require fast \ntransportation to the markets, especially markets in the eastern and coastal regions. Gansu is \nabundant in mineral resources, with proven reserves of 81 minerals, including coal, oil, and natural \ngas. Gansu\u2019s mineral-based industries9 are relatively advanced  compared with other northwest \nprovinces. The export of raw material, mineral-based products, and agricultural outputs strongly \nsupported the economic growth of the region. To increase trading capacity, however, its transport \ninfrastructure needs to be further developed. The proposed Project could also help to foster \ntourism. Gansu was a historic focal point of cultural, social, economic, and commercial exchange \nbetween Europe and Asia. It has several tourism sites, cultural relics, scenic desert spots, and the \nTibetan pastures. These sites, if combined with those in Ningxia and Shaanxi,  could form  a \nprimary tourism route in the northwest PRC. \n \n8.  The proposed Project is in eastern Gansu, which is part of the drought-prone and heavily \neroded Loess Plateau (Map). The alignment is generally parallel to national highway 312, on which \ntraffic  volume  is  reaching  its  physical  capacity  and  the  accident  rate  is  increasing.  \nAmong the three alternative roads in the Xi\u2019an-Lanzhou corridor, the combination of national \nhighway 312 and the project expressway would provide the best option for topography, travel time, \nand safety. The project expressway will be about 232 km long, with 39 medium and large bridges, \n5 tunnels, and 9 interchanges. The project facilities are estimated to require a total of 1,072.6 ha. \nThe alignment will start in Luohandong, as the east end (some 30 km from the provincial border \nbetween Gansu and Shaanxi) to Dingxi (70 km southeast of the provincial capital, Lanzhou), as \nthe  west  end.  The  Project  may  include  a  feeder  road  upgrading  component.  The  project \nexpressway  traverses  five  counties  and  districts  (Anding,  Huining,  Jingchuan,  Jingning,  and \nKongtong) in three municipalities, while the project  influence area will include five additional \nneighboring counties and districts. Out of 10 counties and districts, 5 are key working counties for \npoverty reduction and development. A total of  25,750 km2 of land with 3,864,200  people will be \nunder  the  Project\u2019s  direct  socioeconomic  influence.  The  per  capita  GDP  in  these  areas  was \nCNY2,392 in 2001, which is far lower than the national and provincial averages of CNY7,543 and \nCNY4,165, respectively. The population is largely rural, with 89% of people engaged in agriculture. \nEthnic minorities, (mostly Hui) comprise 9% of Gansu\u2019s population and 5% of the population in the \nproject area. \n \n9.  The lack of rural road access to markets is a serious impediment to increasing agricultural \nproductivity, particularly in the project area. Over 50% of rural townships do not have paved road \naccess to either the county center or to nearby national and provincial highways all such townships \nare in the mountains. Many mountain villages do not have road access. Poor farm-to-market roads \nraise both handing costs and post-harvest losses, further depressing returns. While farmers are \noffered  incentives  to  raise  cash  crops,  poor  road  access  precludes  shift.  Due  to  lack  of \nemployment  opportunities,  migration  for  jobs  is  quite  common  in  the  project  area.  \nThe proposed Project will (i) create some 73,988 person-years of nonfarm employment locally \nthrough the construction of the project expressway, thereby providing the farmers with capital;  \n                                                 \n8  Estimated by the Provincial Poverty Reduction Development Office. The available official figure of below CNY865 is \n36.7%. \n9  Including metallurgy, coal mining, petrifaction, and electric power and construction material industries.

The Project will help \npromote  the  overall  social  and  economic  development  of  eastern  Gansu  and  reduce  the \nwidespread poverty in the project area. The Project is  listed in the Government\u2019s TFYP and is \nconsonant  with  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  for  the  PRC  and  with  the  western  development \nstrategy. \n \n10.  The project preparatory work by the Government is well advanced. The English language \nversion of the project feasibility study, prepared by the Gansu Design Institute, was submitted to \nADB in August 2003. The final endorsement of the feasibility study by the State Development \nReform Commission is expected in December 2003 and the preliminary engineering design will be \ncompleted in January  2004 as per Ministry of Communications standards. The environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  and  a  draft  resettlement  plan  are  scheduled  to  be  completed  in \nDecember 2003. The IPSA and rapid environmental assessment carried out during fact-finding \nhelped identify the social and environmental issues that will need to be addressed during project \npreparation, and reviewed the need for a comprehensive assessment of the social context in line \nwith ADB policies and guidelines on social dimensions. The rapid environmental assessment and \nIPSA are in Appendix 2. The IPSA concluded that key social issues to be analyzed further during \nproject preparation are resettlement and project impacts on poor and minority people. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The TA will help the Government prepare an integrated roads development project to \nsupport pro-poor economic growth and reduce poverty in the project area.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will assist the Gansu Provincial Communications Department (GPCD) to (i) refine \nthe feasibility study, including the EIA and summary EIA, resettlement plan, and poverty impact \nanalysis for the proposed Project, in conformity with ADB\u2019s requirements; (ii) review the project \ndesign and scope to make the project more pro-poor including the need to integrate a local roads \nand feeder roads component into the Project; (iii) identify important socioeconomic indicators and \nthe monitoring mechanisms; (iv) confirm the technical, economic, and financial viability of the \nproposed  investments;  (v)  review  and  update  transport  and  road  profiles;  (vi)  review  the \norganizational structure of road projects financed by the World Bank and ADB and compare the \norganizational structures of approaches with and without corporatization; and (vii) discuss the \nmajor policy issues, assess the poverty impact of the Project (including the poverty impact ratio), \nand propose measures for maximizing the positive impacts on the poor population in the project \narea.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $650,000 equivalent, comprising $294,300 of \nforeign exchange cost and $355,700 equivalent of local currency cost. ADB will provide $500,000 \nequivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and a portion of the local currency cost \namounting to $205,700 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding \nprogram. GPCD will finance the remaining $150,000 equivalent to cover the costs of office \naccommodation and support services, communications, local transport in Lanzhou, office supply, \nand other facilities and services required for the implementation of the TA. The detailed cost \nestimate is in Appendix 3. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n ", "    5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  A team of international consultants in association with domestic consulting firm(s) will be \nengaged using the simplified technical proposal procedures based on the quality- and cost-based \nselection method and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants.  \nThe TA will require a total of 23 person-months of consulting services, including 9 person-months \nof international and 14 person-months of domestic consultancy, to carry out the study as defined in \nthe outline terms of reference (Appendix 4). The international consultants will provide expertise in \n(i) highway and traffic engineering, including geotechnical assessment and bridge and tunnel \ndesign and construction; (ii) traffic forecast analysis; (iii) transport economics; (iv) expressway \nmanagement and institutional analysis; (v) financial and investment analysis; (vi) resettlement \nplanning; (vii) poverty and socioeconomic analysis; and (viii) environmental aspects. The domestic \nconsultants will have expertise in (i) highway and structure engineering; (ii) transport economics \nand financial analysis; (iii) resettlement planning; (iv) environment protection and conservation; \nand (v) social development and poverty reduction. Equipment to be provided for the consultants \nunder  the  TA  will  be  procured  by  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  of \nProcurement.  \n \n15.  GPCD will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will be responsible for supervision and \nmonitoring of TA activities, and liaison with government agencies and organizations. GPCD will \nalso provide office accommodation and transport arrangement within Lanzhou. The TA will start in \nJanuary 2004 when the consultants are scheduled to be fielded. The consulting services will be \ncarried out over a 4-month period, with the TA due to be completed at the end of April 2004. \nGPCD will provide ADB and the consultants with the feasibility study; engineering studies; EIA; \nresettlement  plan;  and  any  other  materials,  recent  studies,  and  reports  required  for  the \nimplementation of the TA. The consultants will maintain close relationships with the Government \nand  GPCD,  and  inform  them  of  progress  and  findings.  A  tripartite  meeting  involving  the \nGovernment, ADB staff, and the consultants will be held in April 2004 in the PRC to provide advice \nand guidance to the consultants and review their reports.  \n \n16.  The consultants will submit the following reports (i) inception report including a survey \nimplementation plan with a proposed questionnaire for socioeconomic, resettlement and poverty \nreduction impact, 3 weeks after commencement of services; (ii) interim report, 7 weeks  after \ncommencement of services; (iii) draft final report, draft EIA, summary EIA, draft resettlement plan, \nand the draft social and poverty assessment report, 11 weeks after commencement of services; \nand (iv) final report, EIA and summary EIA, resettlement plan, and social and poverty assessment \nreport 2 weeks after receiving comments from ADB, the Government, and GPCD. Two copies of \neach  report  in  the  English  and  Chinese  languages  are  required  for  each  of  the  following \norganizations: MOF, NDRC. MOC, SEPA, and GPCD. ADB requires five copies of each report in \nEnglish and two copies of each report in Chinese (except for the final report for which eight copies \nare required in English and three copies in Chinese. \n \nIV.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority in    Sector identified as a national priority in   \ncountry poverty analysis?  Yes  country poverty partnership agreement    Yes \n \nContribution  of  the  sector/subsector  to  reduce  poverty  in  the  People's  Republic  of  China:  \nThe transport sector and the road subsector contributes to poverty reduction directly through improved access to \nmarket, employment opportunities, and social services, and indirectly by stimulating economic development. \n \n2.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Poverty Classification:  Others  \n \nOut of the total 87 counties and districts in Gansu, 43  are national and 8 are provincial level poor counties. \n(Starting in 2001, currently it is named key working counties for poverty reduction and development. Prior to \n2001, they were referred as state designated poverty-stricken counties.) At the lower level of administrative units, \nGansu has 919 poor townships out of its total of 1,533 townships, and 8,790 poor villages among 17,834. About \n36.7% of the rural people live under CHY865 (the national standard for poor, per capita rural income per annum, in \n2000  prices) in Gansu in 2001.  About 50% of rural people are living under  CHY1,000  in  2001.  Table A2.3 \nsummarizes the overall poverty situation of Gansu and the project area. \n \nThe project area includes 5 national level poor counties among  its 10 counties. The area includes about 1.26 \nmillion rural poor, 37.3% of the  total rural population, who earn under CHY865 (national standard for poor, per \ncapita rural income per annum, in 2000 prices) in 2001. About 50% of rural people are living under CHY1,000.  \n \nThe  average  rural  per  capita  income  per  annum  ranged  from  CHY1,165  (Huining  County)  to  CHY1,893 \n(Kongtong District) among the 10 project counties and districts in 2001. The rural income in the project area as a \nwhole was just CHY1,387 per person in 2001, far lower than the provincial average of CHY1,500. In Kongtong \nDistrict (the regional urban center of the Pingliang Municipality) and Huating County (the coal-mining area), where \nthere are more employment opportunities, the rural per capita income was higher than the provincial average. \nThe rural poor are almost exclusively concentrated in mountains where drought is the most striking constraint. In \naddition  to  extreme  drought,  other  causes  of  poverty  include  limited  access  to  markets  and  employment \nopportunities, and poor distribution of services and inputs. The Project will help the rural residents to overcome \nthese constraints. \n \nUrban poverty is also widespread in the project area. The urban poverty incidences, shown in Table A2.4, range \nfrom 7.0% to 20.7% in the five counties that the fact-finding mission visited. Lack of employment opportunities, \ntogether with the competition from rural migrants, are the main causes of urban poverty.  \n \nThe Project will greatly facilitate the urban expansion of Kongtong and Anding  districts; therefore it will create \nmore  employment  opportunities  and  thus  help  reduce  poverty.  The  Project  will  also  help  extend the coal \nmarketing coverage of Huating County to as far as to Dingxi and Lanzhou cities, thus increasing its mining \ncapacity and absorbing some urban poor and more rural migrants. Encouraged by this Project, the local coal \nmining authority has planned to increase its production from the current 8.9 millions tons to 15 million tons in 3\u20135 \nyears. Over 90% of coal marketing has to be dependent on road transportation. \n \n3.  Participation Process \nStakeholder Analysis. Public consultation and consultations with nongovernment and government organizations \nwill be carried out by the Executing Agency, local government officials, a research institute, and other institutes \nduring  preparation  of  the  feasibility  study,  poverty  assessment,  environmental  impact  assessment,  and \nresettlement plan. \nParticipation Strategy Required?

Review the current status and future plans (2001\u20132010 plan) for road development in \nGansu Province and  the project area (prepare maps). Prepare a comprehensive economic \nprofile of the project area. In collaboration with a financial analysis expert, describe the current \nroad development and maintenance system including programming, human resources, and \nfinancing sources, at the province, municipality, county, township, and village levels. Review the \nprovincial government revenues and expenditures of the road sector by type of roads, and \nforecast  the  same  over  2004\u20132010.  Determine  whether  the  increase  in  expressway \nexpenditures is crowding out expenditures for the construction and maintenance of other types \nof roads. Assess the alternative routes from Xi\u2019an and Lanzhou in terms of design standards \n(class), distance, travel time, traffic volume, construction plan, etc. Also assess the demand for \ntransit  traffic  between  Xi\u2019an  and  Lanzhou  and  local  traffic  in  the  Gansu-Ningxia  area.  \nReview and update traffic counts and origin-destination surveys. Analyze traffic data and obtain \ninformation on the traffic patterns by vehicle type and transport mode in Gansu and the project \narea. Assess the capacity of the road network in the project area. Review the vehicle operating ", "  Appendix 4  15 \ncosts by vehicle type, and evaluate them on the existing road and the proposed expressway. \nAssess travel time saving, changes in travel pattern and efficiency of traffic flow movements, \ntransport-cost savings, and any other project benefit, using appropriate shadow prices. \n \n6.  Assess the without-project situation. In addition to the maintenance cost of the existing \nroads,  indicate  any  expenditure  that  would  have  to  be  made  without  the  Project  to \naccommodate  the  anticipated  traffic  increase.  Review  and  update  parameters  used  for \ncomputation of diverted traffic from existing roads and other transport modes. Assess the \ndiverted traffic depending on toll charges and capacity constraints of existing roads along the \nNational Highway 312. Prepare detailed expressway traffic forecasts for each type of vehicle for \nnormal, generated, and diverted traffic, and assess the anticipated average annual daily traffic. \nAssess the impact of toll charges on the traffic forecasts. Select major local commodities and \nestimate  how  the  impact  of  reduced  transportation  cost  on  the  production  of  each  such \ncommodity in with- and without project scenarios. Describe the cases for typical beneficiaries \n(small farmers and manufacturers). The reduction of transportation cost should be examined for \ninbound  and  outbound  traffic.  Assess  quantitatively  how  much  production/benefit  can \nincrementally be generated.   \n \n7.  Undertake  the  economic  evaluation  of  the  Project,  according  to  the Guidelines for \nEconomic Analysis of Projects of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), by comparing the with- \nand without-project cases. Value project costs and benefits in economic prices. Tentatively, a \nstandard conversion factor of 0.926 or a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.08 should be used. \nCalculate relevant economic prices for different types of project labor. Calculate the net present \nvalue of each project component using a discount rate of 12%. Calculate the economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) for the expressway and the local roads, and for the Project as a whole. \nUndertake sensitivity analysis by identifying the most critical factors and determine the impact of \nsuch factors on the EIRR, including, but not limited to, varying project costs, benefits, toll rates, \nimplementation period, traffic, and a combination of these factors. Indicate the toll levels for \nwhich the EIRR falls under the cutoff rate of 12%. Calculate switching values and compare the \nresults with those obtained for ongoing or completed expressway projects in Gansu.

Assess  the  impact  of  the  Project  on  poverty  reduction  both  from  qualitative  and \nquantitative aspects and prepare the poverty impact matrix. Describe the poverty situation in the \nproject area using a selection of indicators, including those used by Millennium Development \nGoals and the PRC Leading Group of Poverty Reduction. Consider macro effects resulting from \neconomic growth as well as micro impacts resulting from improved access. Demonstrate how \neconomic growth will be relevant to, and can be made even more relevant to and inclusive of, \nthe poor and minority populations. Based on an analysis of the poverty reduction specific to the \nproject  area,  identify  which  factors  need  to  be  modulated,  and  how,  so  that  effective \ncomplementarity with road infrastructure development is achieved and accelerates the poverty \nreduction and social development impact in the project area. Assess the economic impacts of \nthe local roads development program on the poor population and minority people. Assess the \nprospects for generating incomes for poor communities through direct and indirect employment \ncreation in project construction and operation. Based on the outcomes of the social and poverty \nanalysis, recommend key issues to be addressed in preparing, designing, and implementing the \nProject, including monitoring and evaluation systems.

Assess temporary and permanent impacts on the environment in \nthe  project  area,  including  (i)  the  impact  on  the  protected  Kongtong  Mountain  and  other \nhistorical and cultural monuments and values, (ii)  the impact of construction and mitigation \nmeasures on erosion and formation of new gullies, and (iii)  negative environmental impacts \nresulting from industrial activities and road traffic. Analyze the likely impact of vehicle emissions \nand suggest appropriate mitigation measures. Review the Government's policy and regulations \nto reduce motor vehicle emission. Determine incremental (implementing) costs of the proposed \nenvironmental mitigation measures or other measures to minimize the adverse environmental \nimpacts. Assess the expected environmental benefits where possible, in a quantifiable manner. \nBased on the EIA and in consultation with the provincial environmental protection bureau, \nprepare an environmental monitoring and management plan to be incorporated in the project \nperformance management system, and estimate the cost of the same. Discuss with the Ningxia \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau the environmental impacts in the western part of the project \nroute in Ningxia Autonomous Region, and assess the sites for indirect, secondary, or cumulative \nimpacts from the neighboring project alignment in Gansu. If such impacts are identified, prepare \nrecommendations and mitigation measures to be taken and describe how such impacts will be \nmonitored by the Ningxia environmental authorities. \n \nE.

Assess  the  government's  approach  and  methodology  in  preparing  the \nresettlement plan, in particular with regard to (i) census survey and asset inventories that \nidentify villages that may be more severely affected (i.e., losing 20% or more of the agricultural \nland); and (ii) poor people and minorities.  \n \n17.  Conduct a socioeconomic survey to assess (through household interviews in severely \naffected and poor villages, minority villages, particularly Hui communities in Kongtong District) \nthe relocated or affected people's income levels, expenditure patterns, landholdings, skill base, \npreference and aspirations, and asset inventory to develop income replacement strategies.  \nThe sample size will be discussed and agreed with ADB based on an estimated number of \naffected people. Prepare a summary resettlement plan. Document the degree to which the plan \nhas been made public and the degree of consultation with the affected people. Assess the \nplan's consistency with the 1998 Land Administration Law and relevant provincial regulations. \nIdentify special measures to help the poor and vulnerable affected people improve their status. \nConsistent  with  poverty  reduction  initiatives,  recommend  income  generation  and  gender \nmeasures in poor communities, taking due account of minority and gender disaggregated data. \nDevelop a system for independent monitoring and evaluation of resettlement activities, including \na  baseline  survey  of  10%  of  the  affected  people  along  with  annual  updates  during \nimplementation,  on  completion,  and  1  year  after  completion  of  the  resettlement.  \nSufficient respondents should be carefully selected so that the information gathered qualifies as \nthe first 10% baseline survey.
