INTRODUCTION\n1. During processing of the Anhui Environmental Improvement Project (AEIP) in the\nPeople's Republic of China (PRC), it became evident that the relevant authorities in cities and\nurban areas in Anhui Province lacked the requisite experience in wastewater collection and\ntreatment systems. The majority of cities in Anhui Province have only partial collection of\nwastewater, usually in conjunction with urban drainage systems, and no wastewater treatment\ncapacity. This is a common problem in PRC, where only a small percentage of the wastewater\nis disposed of in an environmentally sustainable manner. With the increasing requirement for\nconstruction of central wastewater systems in urban areas in the Chao Lake basin and elsewhere\nin Anhui Province, there is a need to develop the capacity of the relevant city utilities. The\nGovernment requested Bank advisory technical assistance' (TA) to develop procedures, training\nprograms and manuals that will facilitate the capacity building of city wastewater utilities in\nenvironmental monitoring and efficient operations of wastewater collection and treatment\nfacilities.\n2. A Fact-finding Mission, fielded from 1 to 16 August 1996, held discussions with\nthe People's Bank of China (PBC), the Anhui Environmental Protection Bureau (AEPB), the Anhui\nProvincial Planning Commission, the Hefei Sewage Treatment Works (HSTW) and the Chaohu\nWastewater Treatment Engineering Company (CWTEC) and reached an understanding on the\nobjectives, scope, terms of reference, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation\narrangements for the TA.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. Chao Lake, the fifth largest standing freshwater body in PRC, is located in the\ncenter of Anhui Province close to its capital city, Hefei. Chao Lake has traditionally been the main\nsource of water for agricultural, industrial and urban uses for the nearly 8 million inhabitants in\nits basin. The upper and lower catchments of the Lake basin, besides being intensively\ncultivated, are home to more than 2,600 industrial enterprises, many of which use outmoded and\nhighly polluting manufacturing technologies, outdated wastewater treatment plants and have\nweak environmental management. Untreated or partially treated municipal and industrial\nwastewater is discharged into local receiving streams which drain to Chao Lake, Agricultural\ndrainage and runoff water contains high levels of nutrient resulting from the excessive use of\ninefficient fertilizer, particularly ammonium chloride and ammonium bicarbonate. As a result, the\nwater quality in the Lake has deteriorated to a level that is unsuitable for municipal use. The most\npressing environmental concern is to prevent the further deterioration of the water quality of Lake\nChao and prevent the lake from \"dying\" because of excessive eutrophication. 2 The AEIP will\naddress the most urgently needed interventions.\n4. The AEIP investment package is only the first intervention of a major environmental\nprogram that the Anhui Provincial Government (APG) and the cities in the Chao Lake basin will\nundertake to save the Lake. Unless further measures are taken, the benefits of the AEIP would\nsoon be overcome by the expected quadrupling of environmental pollutant discharges over the\nnext 10-15 years, as a result of the continuing rapid economic development in the basin.\nTherefore, a number of centralized municipal wastewater treatment facilities and onsite industrial\nwastewater treatment plants will be constructed over this time frame. There is a need to develop\na capability to train the operators of all these treatment plants to ensure that the pollution control\nbenefits accruing from the wastewater treatment plants is fully achieved.\nThe TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities in May 1996.\nDepletion of dissolved oxygen due to growth of algae and other plants resulting from a high level of\ndissolved nutrients in the water.", "E\n5. In 1994, AEPB achieved status as an independent institution with responsibility\nfor administration of provincial environmental management activities and of local level\nenvironmental protection bureaus throughout the province. The Bank is helping AEPB to\nstrengthen its environmental management programs for the Chao Lake basin by improving\nAEPB's ability to monitor and enforce effluent standards that must be met by industrial and\nmunicipal wastewater treatment plants, provide for monitoring and enforcement of these pollution\nstandards, and establish the regulatory framework required to protect Chao Lake. However, the\nrelated programs do not include capacity building of AEPB in the practical operations of\nwastewater treatment facilities. Because of the number of treatment plants involved, there is a\nneed to establish a permanent training program for future treatment plant operators. AEPB would\nthen require all treatment plants in the Chao Lake basin, and the province as a whole, undergo\ntraining as an integral part of the construction permit, license to operate and effluent discharge\nlicenses.\n6. Currently HSTW is constructing a modern wastewater treatment plant, through\nsupport from the Australian Agency for International Development, that will be completed by mid-\n1997. Because of the limited financing available, this assistance was limited to initial studies,\ntechnical designs and procurement of key imported equipment. The financing package did not\nallow for training in the operation, maintenance, and management of this new facility. The Bank's\nTA would utilize the newly completed wastewater treatment plant to develop practical operational\nprocedures and manuals and to provide hands-on training to both AEPB and HSTW staff, based\non the experience gained during commissioning and actual operations. The AEPB and HSTW\nstaff would form the core training group, while the training facilities at the new wastewater\ntreatment plant would provide the venue for the training of future wastewater treatment plant\noperators in Anhui Province, The linkages among the goals, objectives and outputs of the TA are\nin the Project Framework in Appendix 1.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n7. The overall objective of the TA is to build capacity within AEPB and HSTW to\nprovide training in environmental monitoring, operation, maintenance, and management of\nmunicipal and industrial wastewater treatment facilities in Hefei and Chaohu, other smaller cities\nin the Chao Lake basin, and throughout Anhui Province. Specific objectives include\nW establishment of environmental monitoring systems of influents entering\nsewage collection systems and wastewater treatment plants to protect the\nbiological processes from toxic wastes;\n(ii) development of proper technical operation and maintenance procedures\nto ensure efficiency and longer life of the sewers, pump stations, and the\ntreatment plants;\n(iii) development of management capability to ensure proper budgeting,\naccounting, financial planning, and reporting; and\n(iv) training of the operators and managers of the HSTW treatment plant.", "3\nB.\t Scope\n8.\t The scope of the TA will include the following activities:\n(i) developing manuals for efficient operating procedures for wastewater\ncollection, treatment, recycle/reuse and monitoring systems for large\nindustrial enterprises that have to provide onsite treatment;\n(ii) preparing manuals on operating procedures, effluent monitoring, and\nreporting systems including development of environmental monitoring\nsystem for sampling, analyzing, and reporting of wastewater influents and\neffluents and a \"real time\" reporting system to detect, report, and adjust\noperations to handle toxic substance/discharges that could damage\ncentralized municipal wastewater treatment plant processes;\n(iii) developing financial management systems (budgets, income from tariffs,\nfinancial planning) and computerization of accounting, spare parts\ninventory, and routine maintenance procedures;\n(iv) developing personnel management and training programs including\nprocess, maintenance, management, environmental monitoring, and\nreporting procedures; and\n(v) presenting the procedures of the TA in a workshop involving senior-level\nprovincial and city authorities to explain the need for good operations, the\noperational budgets, and the tariffs required to achieve these objectives.\n9. It is expected that the TA will help provide the basis for establishment of a\npermanent training facility for Anhui Province operated by AEPB in conjunction with HSTW. This\nwill help ensure the sustainability of AEPB's environmental management programs.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n10. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $460,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign\nexchange cost of $225,000 and a local currency cost of $235,000 equivalent as detailed in\nAppendix 2. The Government has agreed to provide $60,000 equivalent of local currency costs\nthrough the provision of counterpart and supporting staff and services, and office facilities and\nsupplies. The entire foreign currency cost of $225,000 plus $175,000 equivalent of local currency\ncosts, totalling $400,000 equivalent, will be financed by the Government of Denmark, through\nthe Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), on a grant basis. The Government of\nDenmark has requested the Bank to act as administrator of the TA in accordance with the\nagreement on cofinancing to be entered into between the Bank and DANIDA.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n11, The AEPB will be the Executing Agency for the TA which will facilitate close\ncoordination with other Bank-financed environmental initiatives in Anhui Province. HSTW and\nCWTEC will also provide counterpart staff to ensure that there is technology transfer to these two\nutilities, both of which will implement follow-on wastewater treatment facilities in their respective", "cities. In particular, HSTW's training programs will be strengthened as HSTW will provide the\nphysical training facilities for the future training program.\n12. The TA will be carried out in two phases. Phase I will take place during three\nmonths in 1997 and will include the following: (i) developing the environmental monitoring\nsystems for biological treatment plants; (ii) developing personnel and financial management\nsystems for the municipal wastewater utilities; and (iii) providing operational training programs\nand manuals for biological wastewater treatment plant operators. Phase 2 will be carried out over\nthree months in late 1997, or in early 1998, and will involve improvement of the training programs\nand manuals for operation of wastewater treatment facilities based on the experience gained\nduring the startup of the Hefei wastewater treatment plant,' The TA is expected to be completed\nby June 1998.\n13. The TA will be carried out by an international consulting firm in association with\ndomestic consultants. The domestic consultants should be sourced from local institutes to\nmaximize the technology transfer and to broaden the capability of such local entities to support\nthe overall environmental management program. The international firm will provide two qualified\nand experienced experts who have a track record of developing operations manuals and training\nprograms in the areas of (i) environmental monitoring of wastewater influents and effluents, and\noperations and maintenance of wastewater treatment processes; and (ii) financial systems,\nplanning, management and institutional aspects of wastewater entities. The domestic consultants\nwill provide specialized knowledge on local wastewater treatment practices, management\nprocedures, staffing requirements, budgeting, reporting requirements, enforcement of effluent\nstandards, and training. The terms of reference for the consultants are summarized in Appendix\n3. The consulting firm will be engaged in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants or other arrangements satisfactory to the Bank.\n14. About 6 person-months of international and 30 person-months of domestic\nconsulting services will be required. The actual activities during each phase, and the schedule,\nwill be adjusted as required to ensure maximum benefit and efficiency. The senior domestic\nconsultant will coordinate ongoing activities during the time gap between the phases.\n15. Following completion of Phase 1, the consultants will submit a report clarifying\nand updating the scope of work. At the end of Phase 2, the consultants will submit a draft final\nreport covering both phases. Meetings to review, discuss and approve the two reports will be\nheld in Hefei, attended by representatives of AEPB, HSTW, CWTEC, other officials, the\nconsultants, and the Bank. The TA report will be finalized based on those discussions. The\ntripartite review of the draft final report will include a one-day workshop to present the outputs\nof the TA.\nIV.

Specific objectives include\nW establishment of environmental monitoring systems of influents entering\nsewage collection systems and wastewater treatment plants to protect the\nbiological processes from toxic wastes;\n(ii) development of proper technical operation and maintenance procedures\nto ensure efficiency and longer life of the sewers, pump stations, and the\ntreatment plants;\n(iii) development of management capability to ensure proper budgeting,\naccounting, financial planning, and reporting; and\n(iv) training of the operators and managers of the HSTW treatment plant.", "3\nB.\t Scope\n8.\t The scope of the TA will include the following activities:\n(i) developing manuals for efficient operating procedures for wastewater\ncollection, treatment, recycle/reuse and monitoring systems for large\nindustrial enterprises that have to provide onsite treatment;\n(ii) preparing manuals on operating procedures, effluent monitoring, and\nreporting systems including development of environmental monitoring\nsystem for sampling, analyzing, and reporting of wastewater influents and\neffluents and a \"real time\" reporting system to detect, report, and adjust\noperations to handle toxic substance/discharges that could damage\ncentralized municipal wastewater treatment plant processes;\n(iii) developing financial management systems (budgets, income from tariffs,\nfinancial planning) and computerization of accounting, spare parts\ninventory, and routine maintenance procedures;\n(iv) developing personnel management and training programs including\nprocess, maintenance, management, environmental monitoring, and\nreporting procedures; and\n(v) presenting the procedures of the TA in a workshop involving senior-level\nprovincial and city authorities to explain the need for good operations, the\noperational budgets, and the tariffs required to achieve these objectives.\n9. It is expected that the TA will help provide the basis for establishment of a\npermanent training facility for Anhui Province operated by AEPB in conjunction with HSTW. This\nwill help ensure the sustainability of AEPB's environmental management programs.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n10. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $460,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign\nexchange cost of $225,000 and a local currency cost of $235,000 equivalent as detailed in\nAppendix 2. The Government has agreed to provide $60,000 equivalent of local currency costs\nthrough the provision of counterpart and supporting staff and services, and office facilities and\nsupplies. The entire foreign currency cost of $225,000 plus $175,000 equivalent of local currency\ncosts, totalling $400,000 equivalent, will be financed by the Government of Denmark, through\nthe Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), on a grant basis. The Government of\nDenmark has requested the Bank to act as administrator of the TA in accordance with the\nagreement on cofinancing to be entered into between the Bank and DANIDA.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n11, The AEPB will be the Executing Agency for the TA which will facilitate close\ncoordination with other Bank-financed environmental initiatives in Anhui Province. HSTW and\nCWTEC will also provide counterpart staff to ensure that there is technology transfer to these two\nutilities, both of which will implement follow-on wastewater treatment facilities in their respective", "cities. In particular, HSTW's training programs will be strengthened as HSTW will provide the\nphysical training facilities for the future training program.\n12. The TA will be carried out in two phases. Phase I will take place during three\nmonths in 1997 and will include the following: (i) developing the environmental monitoring\nsystems for biological treatment plants; (ii) developing personnel and financial management\nsystems for the municipal wastewater utilities; and (iii) providing operational training programs\nand manuals for biological wastewater treatment plant operators. Phase 2 will be carried out over\nthree months in late 1997, or in early 1998, and will involve improvement of the training programs\nand manuals for operation of wastewater treatment facilities based on the experience gained\nduring the startup of the Hefei wastewater treatment plant,' The TA is expected to be completed\nby June 1998.\n13. The TA will be carried out by an international consulting firm in association with\ndomestic consultants. The domestic consultants should be sourced from local institutes to\nmaximize the technology transfer and to broaden the capability of such local entities to support\nthe overall environmental management program. The international firm will provide two qualified\nand experienced experts who have a track record of developing operations manuals and training\nprograms in the areas of (i) environmental monitoring of wastewater influents and effluents, and\noperations and maintenance of wastewater treatment processes; and (ii) financial systems,\nplanning, management and institutional aspects of wastewater entities. The domestic consultants\nwill provide specialized knowledge on local wastewater treatment practices, management\nprocedures, staffing requirements, budgeting, reporting requirements, enforcement of effluent\nstandards, and training. The terms of reference for the consultants are summarized in Appendix\n3. The consulting firm will be engaged in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants or other arrangements satisfactory to the Bank.\n14. About 6 person-months of international and 30 person-months of domestic\nconsulting services will be required. The actual activities during each phase, and the schedule,\nwill be adjusted as required to ensure maximum benefit and efficiency. The senior domestic\nconsultant will coordinate ongoing activities during the time gap between the phases.\n15. Following completion of Phase 1, the consultants will submit a report clarifying\nand updating the scope of work. At the end of Phase 2, the consultants will submit a draft final\nreport covering both phases. Meetings to review, discuss and approve the two reports will be\nheld in Hefei, attended by representatives of AEPB, HSTW, CWTEC, other officials, the\nconsultants, and the Bank. The TA report will be finalized based on those discussions. The\ntripartite review of the draft final report will include a one-day workshop to present the outputs\nof the TA.\nIV.
