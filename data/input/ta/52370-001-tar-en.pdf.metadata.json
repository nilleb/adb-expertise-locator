The  regional  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  further \ninstitutional development of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Institute, \nan  intergovernmental  organization  that  aims  to  contribute to the  CAREC  Program  through \nknowledge generation and capacity building.1 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been \nsupporting the CAREC Institute from its inception, and this TA will build on previous ADB support \nprovided to the CAREC Institute.2 This TA will (i) strengthen the CAREC Institute\u2019s institutional \ncapacity and financial sustainability, (ii) enhance the quality of the CAREC Institute\u2019s knowledge \nproducts and services (KPS), and (iii) invigorate the CAREC Institute\u2019s communication and \noutreach  functions.  The  TA  will  help  realize  the  CAREC  Institute\u2019s  potential  comparative \nadvantages and uniqueness.3 \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and its operational priority of fostering \nregional cooperation and integration (RCI).4 It is also in line with the CAREC Strategy 2030, which \ncalls on the CAREC Institute to promote policy dialogue among CAREC countries on key \neconomic, social, and governance issues based on value-adding knowledge work.5 This value-\nadded work has become even more important as CAREC countries fight the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) and its socioeconomic implications.6  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Since its establishment, the CAREC Institute has made important progress in all four areas \nof its operations\u2014research, capacity building, knowledge management, and networking and \npartnerships. Together with funding from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), ADB\u2019s previous \nand ongoing TA projects contributed to the establishment and functioning of the CAREC Institute \nin delivering its mandate as a knowledge arm of the CAREC Program. In addition to TA support, \nthe ADB team is providing intellectual support to the CAREC Institute\u2019s activities, with regular \nguidance and technical advice from ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department and other ADB \ndepartments and units.7 The CAREC Institute has significantly shored up its institutional capacity.8 \n \n1  The CAREC Institute was established in 2006 as a virtual institute; and opened its physical headquarters in March \n2015 in Urumqi, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The Intergovernmental \nAgreement establishing the CAREC Institute outlines its five key functions: (i) conduct strategic research, (ii) provide \ninnovative solutions, (iii) disseminate research findings and results, (iv) enhance the capabilities of government \nofficials, and (v) develop a network of research institutions in the CAREC region. \n2  ADB.  2012.  Technical  Assistance  for  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation:  Supporting  Capacity \nDevelopment Needs of CAREC 2020. Manila (TA 8301, ongoing until March 2021). Earlier support includes ADB. \n2008. Technical Assistance for Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Institute, 2009\u20132012. Manila (TA 6488, \nimplemented during 2008\u20132015). \n3  The uniqueness and potential comparative advantage of the CAREC Institute lie in (i) its regional mandate, focus on \nregional cooperation, and coverage of multiple sectors closely linked to CAREC priorities, as opposed to other think \ntanks in CAREC countries that have national mandates and a specific subject focus; (ii) its knowledge base of the \nregion, as most CAREC Institute staff are from CAREC member countries and have proven records in research, \ncapacity building, and policy analysis; (iii) its intergovernmental status; and (iv) strong and sustained support from \nADB and the PRC.  \n4  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n5  ADB. 2017. CAREC 2030: Connecting the Region for Shared and Sustainable Development. Manila. \n6  A regional cooperation operations business plan does not exist. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities \nsection of ADB\u2019s website on 18 November 2020. \n7  ADB, the Asian Development Bank Institute, and the CAREC Institute also signed a cooperation agreement in 2017 \nthat provides a framework for sharing knowledge, undertaking joint workshops and seminars, organizing staff \nexchanges, and cofinancing research and capacity development. \n8  The CAREC Institute has established research teams in the research division and the chief economist\u2019s unit, among \nothers. It has introduced a quality assurance process, including a publication policy and an external review board. \n     \n ", "2      \n \n4.  The CAREC Institute is still at an early stage of development in becoming a reputable \nregional think tank. Its in-house expertise needs to be deepened and it needs to devise ways to \nmeet its aspirations with limited resources. The CAREC Institute should also build up its brand \nand reputation in a systemic yet gradual way, through the development of a few key (\u201cflagship\u201d) \nproducts and activities and gradual expansion to other carefully selected areas. The following key \nneeds and challenges are identified. \n \n5.  Adjusted vision for the Institute. The future of the CAREC Institute\u2014its relevance, \nreputation, and place in an increasingly competitive landscape\u2014depends on its ability to provide \nunique, tailored, and world-quality KPS on the emerging needs and challenges related to RCI in \nthe CAREC region. The ongoing midterm review of the CAREC Institute Strategy, 2018\u20132022,9 \nwhile evaluating its implementation from 2018 to 2020, is adopting a more forward-looking \napproach and vision, adjusting them to the changing realities and evolving demands.10 \n \n6.  Quality of knowledge products and services. Enhancing the quality of KPS is at the \ncore of many issues facing the CAREC Institute. Together with increased responsiveness of the \nCAREC Institute\u2019s knowledge services to the needs of the CAREC countries, the enhanced \nquality of its KPS should lead to a better impact on policy making in the CAREC region, the \nCAREC Institute\u2019s financial sustainability, brand recognition, and increased country ownership in \nthe CAREC Institute.  \n \n7.  Attraction of best talent and organizational issues. The single most important factor \ndetermining the quality of the CAREC Institute\u2019s KPS is the quality of its staffing. Attracting \ntalented staff has been a hurdle for the CAREC Institute. From 2016-2018, key positions were \nfilled after lagging recruitment, and efforts to attract quality staff need to continue, through various \nmeans and channels.  \n \n8.  Financial sustainability of the Institute. After 5 years of existence with a physical \npresence, the CAREC Institute remains heavily dependent on financing from the PRC and ADB. \nIn the longer term, this is not a sustainable basis on which the CAREC Institute can expect to \nfunction. A key objective, therefore, is to expand and diversify the institute\u2019s sources of funding.11 \nOngoing efforts for financial sustainability should be supported by prudent financial management \narrangements. \n \n9.  The Institute in the post-COVID-19 world. The outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly \naltered economic and social lives in CAREC countries, and has affected the CAREC Institute\u2019s \nactivities.12 The CAREC Institute, with ADB assistance, has been adapting by developing an e-\nplatform for the learning management system and by contributing to the knowledge base on the \n \n9   CAREC Institute. 2018. CAREC Institute Strategy, 2018\u20132022. Urumqi. \n10  The midterm review considers the changing external landscape, including the unfolding COVID-19 crisis, as well as \nadjustments to CAREC Institute operations. It has involved consultations with a wide range of stakeholders, including \nthe CAREC member countries, ADB, and the CAREC Institute\u2019s Advisory Council. The midterm review is being \ntransformed into an updated CAREC Institute Strategy that will extend to 2025. \n11  A completed exploratory assessment of the financial sustainability of the CAREC Institute in 2020 recommended \nseveral  key  actions  for  financial  resource  mobilization  and  complementary  actions  influencing  its  financial \nsustainability.  The  CAREC  Institute\u2019s  Financial  Sustainability  Working  Group  discussed  the  proposed \nrecommendations in September 2020, and they will be presented to the Governing Council in 2021.  \n12 Many of the CAREC Institute\u2019s planned projects could not be undertaken because of travel restrictions and \nquarantine regimes in CAREC countries, the diversion of the attention of government officials and the expert \ncommunity to the COVID-19 crisis, and constraints on national budget resources. ", "    3 \n \nCOVID-19 crisis in the region.13 The CAREC Institute will have to adapt its knowledge work and \nways of functioning to the post-COVID world. It should strive to become a leader in the provision \nof virtual knowledge services in the region.  \n \n10.  Country ownership. Interviews with a wide range of experts in the region have revealed \nthat country ownership in the functioning of the CAREC Institute should be strengthened. Building \ngreater country ownership and client demand will depend, significantly, on enhancing the quality \nof the CAREC Institute\u2019s KPS, sharpening the focus and responsiveness of its knowledge service \npriorities, and improving the representativeness of its staffing. \n \n11.  Knowledge management. While the CAREC Institute has made efforts to improve its \nknowledge management in recent years, there is room for significant strengthening, including \nimprovement of the CAREC Institute\u2019s website, outreach to high-level policy makers in the region, \nengaging into strong partnerships with leading global and regional think tanks, and increasing the \nCAREC Institute\u2019s overall visibility to a wider audience through an appropriate communication \nstrategy. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  Solidifying its hard-earned gains in recent years, the TA will help the CAREC Institute \nrefine its vision and business model, and entrench processes toward becoming a reputable and \nfinancially sustainable think tank in the CAREC region. The TA is aligned with the following impact: \nstronger regional cooperation among CAREC member countries based on high-quality policy \ndialogue and value-adding knowledge work realized (footnote 5). The TA will have the following \noutcome:  the  CAREC  Institute  functioning  as  an  independent  entity  delivering  high-quality \nknowledge services.14 The following three outputs will assist in achieving the impact and outcome. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n13.  Output 1: Institutional capacity and financial sustainability strengthened. This output \nwill support further institutional development of the CAREC Institute to adopt its refined vision and \nstrategy, and support the CAREC Institute\u2019s functioning in the future as a reputable and financially \nsustainable regional think tank. Assistance under this output will be directed at (i) identifying and \nadopting  global  think  tanks\u2019  institutional  best  practices,  (ii)  ensuring the  CAREC  Institute\u2019s \nfinancial sustainability and resource mobilization,15 (iii) enhancing country ownership of the \nCAREC Institute, (iv) attracting and retaining talent, and (v) strengthening the CAREC Institute\u2019s \nquality assurance process.16  \n \n \n13 The CAREC Institute has launched studies assessing the impact of COVID-19 on the micro, small, and medium-\nsized enterprises, and on the tourism sector in CAREC countries. A third study on vaccine perception in selected \nCAREC countries is in the preparation stage. Several COVID-related policy briefs were produced, and a series of \nwebinars and knowledge sharing events were organized. \n14 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n15 Along with the implementation of the recommendations (footnote 11), the TA will undertake a financial management \nassessment of the CAREC Institute; and will prepare, train staff for, and implement, the resource mobilization \nstrategy. \n16 In the past, and as a current practice, much of the quality assurance process involves a review by and advice from \nADB staff. The TA will strengthen efforts to build a strong and efficient quality assurance process by the CAREC \nInstitute, which is a key element for becoming a mature and respected knowledge institution. \n     \n ", "4      \n \n14.  In addition, this output will help address the CAREC Institute\u2019s organizational challenges \nand issues, in line with its updated strategy. ADB assistance will help reinvigorate the work and \ndeliberations of the CAREC Institute\u2019s Governing Council and its Advisory Council to become \nmore proactive in providing policy guidance to the CAREC Institute management and maintaining \noversight of its performance and financial management. The TA will help establish a results-based \nframework and performance management system.17 It will also support the CAREC Institute\u2019s \ntransition from the current functional approach of planning and managing its knowledge activities \nseparately through research, capacity building, and knowledge management, to a programmatic \napproach under which these activities are jointly deployed to support improved development \npolicies, practices, and outcomes in CAREC member countries in well-specified priority program \nareas.  \n \n15.  In the process, the relationship between ADB and the CAREC Institute will evolve to the \nnext level as the CAREC Institute obtains more authority and accountability as an independent \nentity;  and  ADB,  aside  from  TA funding, focuses  increasingly  on  strategic  and  intellectual \nsupport.18  \n \n16.  Output 2: Knowledge functions enhanced. The quality of the CAREC Institute\u2019s work \nwill be critical for distinguishing it from similar institutions, building up its brand, and enhancing \ncountry ownership. The CAREC Institute must place a premium on the quality of its KPS and \nremain focused on upgrading its research, capacity building, and knowledge management work. \nThe TA will provide internationally recognized economic and technical expertise to assist the \nCAREC Institute in delivering top-notch knowledge products. The assistance will be directed at \nestablishing strategic research planning and instilling a rigorous research culture, undertaking \noriginal  research  with  practical  policy  implications  for  member  countries,  and  ensuring the \nanalytical independence that is a salient characteristic of reputable global think tanks.19   \n  \n17.  The ability to deliver relevant and high-quality KPS that promote RCI in the CAREC region \nshould become the primary principle for selecting the CAREC Institute\u2019s knowledge services and \noperational areas. This principle should lead to organic selectivity of the CAREC Institute\u2019s \nknowledge services on a few core demand-driven areas, commensurate with its human, financial, \nand organizational resources.20 The TA will continue to support the CAREC Institute\u2019s ongoing \nVisiting Fellow Program, strengthening its linkage with the work of CAREC\u2019s sector coordinating \ncommittees and other channels to ensure policy relevance to and a close fit with CAREC \n \n17 The results-based framework will add, where possible, new innovative indicators and parameters to track the results \nof the CAREC Institute activities in a meaningful way. They could be based on the specific, measurable, achievable, \nrelevant, and time-bound (SMART) system, and be linked to structural and financial decision-making processes. \n18 The TA will explore alternative mechanisms for the use of TA resources for engagement of consulting services by \nthe CAREC Institute, whereby it could directly advertise and engage consulting services. ADB has already launched \na capacity building program for the CAREC Institute on ADB\u2019s principles and procedures for the recruitment of \nconsulting services. ADB will also consider promoting the use of the CAREC Institute for project management, \nmonitoring, capacity building, involvement of civil society etc., in its CAREC projects, including, potentially, on a fee-\nfor-service basis. \n19 As the CAREC Institute engages in research that strives to advance the RCI agenda in the CAREC region and \nproduce objective analytics, its work should be shielded from political intervention. \n20 Examples of the emerging \u201cflagship\u201d areas and products include the CAREC Corridor Performance Measurement \nand Monitoring (CPMM) work, the CAREC Regional Integration Index, the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the \nregion and the need to \u201crebuild better,\u201d and the digitalization agenda in CAREC. Currently led by ADB, the CPMM is \nbeing gradually transferred to the CAREC Institute through training and building of the CAREC Institute team\u2019s \nexpertise and experience on the subject. ", "    5 \n \noperations. The TA will also support refinements to the CAREC Institute\u2019s capacity building and \ntraining program, adjusted for virtual delivery.21 \n \n18.  Output 3: Knowledge management improved. The TA will assist the CAREC Institute \nin strengthening the dissemination of its KPS to policy makers in the CAREC region, with the aim \nof increasing the impact of these KPS on RCI-promoting policies, taking into account the changed \nways that knowledge products are consumed.22 This output will support the development and \ndissemination of a new product, the CAREC Institute\u2019s annual flagship report,23 as well as a \ncarefully calibrated approach to virtual knowledge activities, communication, partnerships, and \nnetworking in the post-COVID-19 world. In addition, given the large regional knowledge and data \ngap, the TA will explore the creation of a regional multilingual data center at the CAREC Institute. \nThe TA will continue providing support for access to various online resources, databases, and \nsoftware required for knowledge services. The developed CAREC Institute\u2019s communication and \nbranding strategy will include new multilingual knowledge dissemination and outreach channels, \nincluding a revamped CAREC Institute website and a presence on popular virtual platforms, to \nextend outreach across the region and globally.24  \n \n19.  The CAREC Institute has made significant progress in expanding its network among \nnational research institutions in the region and beyond since 2015. The CAREC Think Tank \nNetwork  has  about  70  regional  think  tanks  and  universities,  and  the  annual  Think  Tank \nDevelopment Forum has become an annual knowledge and experiences sharing event.25 The \nnext stage of CAREC Institute development should evolve into mutually beneficial partnering with \nrecognized organizations for the joint production of KPS, the attraction of knowledge project \nfunding, and wider outreach.26  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, of which (i) $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6 and TASF-other sources) and \n(ii) $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty \nReduction and Regional Cooperation Fund (PRC Fund) and administered by ADB.27 The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n \n21 This involves designing programs for a larger number of beneficiaries as well as their convenience (e.g., taking \ntraining at a time of their choice and pacing their learning accordingly), designing proper certification, and other \nmeasures.    \n22 For example, knowledge products could be packaged in bite-size information, extracting key messages; or through \nincreased use of podcasts, dialogues in local languages, infographics, policy briefs, or mobile communication tools. \n23 The preliminary idea for the annual flagship report is to provide a yearly update on the regional integration index in \nthe CAREC region, with a changing theme chapter each year. The proposed theme chapter for the inaugural 2021 \nreport is the impact of COVID-19 on the CAREC region in selected areas (e.g., the impact on micro, small, and \nmedium-sized enterprises; tourism; or e-commerce).  \n24 The CAREC Institute products will be also disseminated through various publications, the annual CAREC Think Tank \nForum, research symposia, CAREC sector coordinating committees, and other CAREC channels. This TA will also \nsupport aligning the CAREC Institute\u2019s communication and branding strategy with that of the CAREC Program. \n25 The forum brings together think tanks, academia, and governments to exchange views and share knowledge on \nevolving regional policy challenges. Up to five research grants are provided annually to support the joint research \nactivities of the CAREC Think Tank Network. \n26 Establishing partnerships with leading global think tanks (and, potentially, a twinning arrangement with one of them), \nwill be explored under the TA. Examples of global think tanks include the Asian Development Bank Institute, the \nBrookings Institution, the Center for Global Development, George Washington University\u2019s Central Asia Program, \nand Harvard University\u2019s Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies. \n27 The fund was originally named \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund\u201d in \nthe 2005 Board paper. Application to the fund was made on 8 October 2020.  \n     \n ", "6      \n \n21.  The PRC Fund will finance TA operational expenses in the form of consulting services \nand related goods and services, trainings, and conferences. The PRC Fund will not be used for \n(i) civil works, (ii) procurement of large-scale equipment, or (iii) permanent staffing costs. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.  It  will  be  implemented  from  December  2020  to \nSeptember 2023.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency;  and  the  Regional  Cooperation  and \nOperations Coordination Division of ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department will be the TA \nsupervising unit. As the implementing agency, the CAREC Institute will be responsible for the \noverall and day-to-day implementation of TA activities. The TA supervising unit will work closely \nwith other ADB departments and relevant organizations to provide institutional and technical \nsupport to the CAREC Institute. ADB staff may act as resource persons at knowledge events and \nworkshops,  with  travel  costs  charged  to  the  TA.  The  implementation  arrangements  are \nsummarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  December 2020\u2013September 2023   \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank  \nImplementing agency  CAREC Institute  \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual selection  International experts  $800,000 \n(55 person-months) \nIndividual selection  National experts  $400,000 \n(60 person-months) \n  Individual selection  Resource persons  $90,000 \n(8 person-months) \n  \n  Firm: QCBSa  Institutional support  $600,000 \nto CAREC Institute \nProcurementb  To be procured by ADB \n  Open competitive bidding,  1\u20132 contracts  $10,000 \nrequest for quotation, or direct \ncontracting, as appropriate \nDisbursement   The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from \ntime to time).  \nAsset turnover or disposal  Equipment will be turned over to CAREC Institute once the TA is \narrangements upon TA  completed. \ncompletion \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CAREC = Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation, QCBS = quality- and cost-\nbased selection, TA = technical assistance.  \na  The use of a firm will be decided at stage 1 of the consulting services. \nb  Procurement will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n23.  Consulting services. The consulting services will be undertaken in two stages. Stage 1 \nwill engage resource persons who are experts on think tank management and RCI, under \noutput 1, to review the CAREC Institute\u2019s development, its current strategies, and plans for \ninstitutional development; and to advise on the CAREC Institute\u2019s overall direction and on detailed ", "    7 \n \nwork plans under this TA.28 Stage 2 will engage consulting services under the three outputs.29 \nBased on the guidance of experts under stage 1, ADB will modify the indicative terms of reference \nin consultation with the CAREC Institute.  \n \n24.  The consultants and resource persons under outputs 1 and 3 will be specialists in think \ntank  organization  and  functioning;  financial  sustainability  and  financial  management; \norganizational  efficiency;  knowledge  management;  and  information  and  communication \ntechnology, editing (English, Russian, Mandarin), and graphic design. Under output 2, reputable \nexperts in economic development, RCI, and specific subject matter will be recruited to help \nestablish strategic research planning, conceptualize and develop the research and capacity \nbuilding products, and strengthen the peer review systems for the CAREC Institute\u2019s publications. \nExperts will also provide advice to individual studies and knowledge service initiatives to help \nensure their relevance and quality in design and implementation. A capacity building consultant \nwill help the CAREC Institute further strengthen the virtual delivery of capacity building and \ntraining activities to improve their effectiveness and outreach. The consultants will also provide \nadvice on academic research networking, including revitalizing the CAREC Institute Think Tank \nNetwork and the Think Tank Development Forum. \n \n25.  ADB will engage the consultants as individuals or firms following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions \nand/or staff instructions.30  \n \n26.  Cofinancier  requirements.  ADB  will  provide  the  PRC  Fund  with  periodic  reports \n(e.g., progress reports and additional updates on project implementation) and support the fund\u2019s \nvisibility as outlined in the PRC Fund Contribution Agreement (2017) and its implementation \nguidelines. For major changes in the project scope, duration, or funding arrangements, the TA \nteam will circulate draft memos to the Partner Funds Division of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development \nand Climate Change Department for review before approval. Disbursement will follow the cost-\nsharing principle, subject to the PRC Fund agreement and guidelines. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n27.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) administering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding \nthe equivalent of $1,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China \nPoverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis for Supporting the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation Institute, and hereby reports this action to the Board.\n \n \n28 Stage 1 will determine whether a firm (e.g., a research institution, think tank(s), or a consortium) will be most effective \nand efficient for selected services or a package of services.
