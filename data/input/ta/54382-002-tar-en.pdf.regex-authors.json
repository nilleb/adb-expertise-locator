INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) to the Government of Pakistan will \nstrengthen fiscal sustainability leading to improved development outcomes by initiating key \nreforms in public financial management (PFM) and tax policy. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwill provide support to the Government of Pakistan in high-priority areas and areas that are \nincluded in the Public Finance Management Act, 2019.1 The TA contains actions and initiatives \nfor the following key reforms: (i) strengthening the capacity for tax policy analysis and design, (ii) \nstrengthening the capacity for cash management and forecasting practices, and (iii) improving the \nsystem for delegated financial authority. The TA is aligned with the priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy \n20302 and the country operations business plan for Pakistan, 2020\u20132022.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Pakistan\u2019s economy has witnessed repeated boom and bust cycles resulting in the country \nseeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at different times. The IMF\u2019s 3-\nyear Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Pakistan, approved in 2019, marks the 13th IMF assistance \nprogram since 1988. Under the 2019 EEF, the IMF supports the government aligning the \nexchange rate policy with market fundamentals, increasing energy prices to reduce off-budget \nliabilities, raising interest rates, and reducing the fiscal deficit. Subsequently, between FY2018 \nand FY2020, the exchange rate depreciated by about 40%, interest rates increased to 13%, and \nelectricity prices increased by 15%. These measures resulted in reducing the account deficit from \n$19 billion, or 6.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2017\u201318, to $3 billion, or 1.7% of GDP \nin FY2019\u201320.4 However, some key reforms that pave the way for fiscal adjustments under the \nIMF\u2019s EFF remain unaddressed.5 \n \n3.  High and unsustainable budget deficit. One of the key reasons for repeated IMF \nprogram assistance in Pakistan is the persistently high and unsustainable budget deficit. Between \n2012 and 2020, Pakistan\u2019s average fiscal deficit was 6.7%. As per the Fiscal Responsibility and \nDebt Limitation Act, 2005, the budget deficit was required to be reduced to 3.5% of GDP for \nFY2017\u20132018 and maintained at this level.6 However, this fiscal rule was breached, and, because \nof the high budget deficit, the public debt to GDP ratio increased to 87% of GDP by June 2020. \nThis level of public debt significantly burdens the future fiscal sustainability of Pakistan. Low \nrevenues are considered one of the main constraints in narrowing the budget deficit. Between \n2012 and 2019, Pakistan\u2019s total revenue (excluding grants) was 14.6% of GDP, the lowest in the \nCWRD region and significantly lower than the regional average of 25.3% for the same period. \n(25.3%).7 Pakistan\u2019s tax to GDP ratio during this period was about 11.6%, which is significantly \nlower than other countries in the region such as Uzbekistan (19.3%), Kazakhstan (18.0%), and \nthe Kyrgyz Republic (20%).  \n \n4.  The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated the fiscal situation. Following the outbreak \nof the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the budget deficit increased to 8.1% of GDP \n \n1  Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance of Pakistan. 2019.

The overall target \nfor FY2019\u201320 was set at PRs5.5 trillion, while the actual collection was recorded at about PRs3.9 \ntrillion (i.e., a gap of 29%). One of the reasons for the high fiscal deficit was the announcement of \na fiscal stimulus package of about PRs1.2 trillion (3% of GDP) that contains emergency response \nand support to individuals and businesses.  \n \n5.  Reduced federal discretionary fiscal space. With the passage of the 7th National \nFinance Commission Award in 2010, an increased share of government taxes began being \ntransferred to the provinces (57.5% as compared to about 47.5% stipulated in the 6th National \nFinance Commission Award).8 The net revenue retained by the federal government decreased \nfrom an average of about 9% of GDP in the previous award to about 7% of GDP. This level of \nrevenue is inadequate to finance large and inelastic public expenditures such as debt servicing \nand defense, as well as the wages and pensions of government employees. During FY2019\u201320, \nthe net revenue retained by the federal government was lower than the debt service it incurred \non domestic and foreign loans, highlighting the extremely limited fiscal space that exists federally. \nThe 2019 PFM Act requires an improved version of delegated financial authority to principal \naccounting officers; however, the implementation of these reforms has been slow, and the low \nnet revenue retained federally continues to be a significant driver of wide and persistent fiscal \ndeficit.  \n \n6.  Estimated fiscal deficit. The government-announced budget for FY2020\u201321 estimates \na fiscal deficit of 7.0% of GDP. This signals a decline in the fiscal deficit compared with FY2019\u2013\nFY20, when the fiscal deficit reached 8.4% of GDP. However, large off-budget liabilities (about 6% \nof GDP of Pakistan\u2019s stock of contingent liabilities in the shape of debts and unpaid arrears in the \nenergy and commodity sectors) and losses of state-owned enterprises (about 1% of GDP on \naverage per year) make the fiscal situation unsustainable in the medium-term. \n \n7.  The unstable fiscal situation makes structural reforms in the areas of PFM and fiscal policy \nessential. Under the IMF\u2019s EFF, the Government of Pakistan committed to a series of structural \nreforms  aimed  at  improving  fiscal  stability  and  transparency.  The  PFM  Act,  prepared  and \napproved  with  ADB\u2019s  support,  provides  legal  cover  for  improved  fiscal  transparency, \naccountability, and higher quality and efficiency of spending. However, since its adoption in 2019, \noperationalizing the PFM Act has been limited. The TA seeks to support the government in \nimplementing the PFM Act, which will ensure increased fiscal stability and strengthen the quality \nand effectiveness of public spending. Adequate implementation of the PFM Act will also help \nPakistan meet its fiscal deficit target of 4.8% by June 2023, a commitment enshrined in the \ngovernment\u2019s medium-term budgetary statement.9  \n \n \n8  The announcement of the 7th National Finance Commission Award on 18 March 2010 resolved the issue of \ndistribution of resources between the federation and the provinces of Pakistan.

The TA is aligned with the following impact: macroeconomic management strengthened \nand more sustained and inclusive growth supported.10 The TA will have the following outcome: \nPakistan\u2019s fiscal and debt sustainability strengthened.11 Therefore, a target deficit of 4.8% of GDP \nwas set under this TA for 2023, in line with government\u2019s target.  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n9.  Output 1: Capacity for tax policy analysis and design strengthened. The current tax \nstructure has not been able to meet the revenue needs of the economy, leading to wide fiscal \ndeficits. The burden of taxation is also highly skewed and regressive, affecting the overall \nbusiness environment, discouraging investment in industry and the export sector, and widening \ninequalities. Tax compliance is weak and relies on presumptive and regressive tax withholdings. \nTherefore, the establishment of a capacitated and dedicated tax policy unit is recommended to \ncarry out five functions: (i) guide general tax design and associated public consultations; (ii) \nperform  revenue  and  economic  impact  analyses;  (iii)  initiate,  participate,  and  oversee  the \nmanifestation of policy content during legal drafting processes; (iv) support the government in \nnegotiating tax treaties toward international tax obligations; and (v) guide tax reforms and \ncoordinate tax policy between governments.  \n \n10.  Output 2: Capacity for cash management and forecasting practices strengthened. \nAn ineffective cash management and forecasting system hinders the accurate understanding and \nmanagement of liquid financial assets and shortages and, consequently, predictability in budget \nexecution. Unplanned and discretionary fiscal pressures, such as those experienced under the \ncoronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, contribute to widening the fiscal deficit. Therefore, the \ngovernment committed to formalize policy and rules to prescribe an effective cash management \nsystem under section 30 of the PFM Act. However, the system requires strengthening and \nbuilding the capacity of key government officials. Specifically, the following key activities are \nrequired to be supported: (i) review data entry points from which cash forecasts will be required \nand issue instructions on cash forecasts; (ii) develop a functional specifications document to \ninclude forecasts in the integrated financial management information system to configure the \nsystems, applications, and products system to start the cash-forecasting system; and (iii) train \nkey data providers and officials of the Ministry of Finance to forecast cash requirements using \nvarious models.  \n \n11.  Output 3: System for delegated financial authority improved. The PFM Act, 2019 \nrequires the delegation of financial powers to principal accounting officers to be improved. The \nFinancial Adviser Organization (part of the Ministry of Finance\u2019s transactional level of control over \nfinancial transactions of line ministries) has been abolished as a result of the PFM Act. The \nfollowing activities are proposed to improve delegation: (i) review the system of delegating \nfinancial authority and control, which will require reviewing the existing rules and regulations, laws, \nand other office orders; (ii) formulate a policy note on the revised system of financial authority and \ncontrol that provides clarity on the delegated powers and defines the internal control mechanism \nthat the Cabinet should approve for effective implementation; and (iii) based on the policy note, \n \n10 Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform. 2014.

These reforms were envisaged in the PFM Act to improve \nthe financial management capacity of line ministries, strengthen the internal control system, and \nimprove implementation capability. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $550,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2.  \n \n13.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff time allocation, office \naccommodation, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation (as required), and other in-kind \ncontributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will administer the TA through the Public Management, Financial Sector and Trade \nDivision of its Central and West Asia Department, which will select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants; organize discussions; and provide staff to act as resource persons, as required. \nADB\u2019s Pakistan Resident Mission will provide local administrative and coordination support, as \nneeded.  \n \n15.
