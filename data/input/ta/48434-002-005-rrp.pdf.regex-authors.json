I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF), and (ii) a proposed policy-based loan (PBL), both to India \nfor  the  Visakhapatnam\u2013Chennai  Industrial  Corridor  Development  Program  (VCICDP).1 The \nreport also describes the proposed (i) administration of a grant to be provided by the Urban \nClimate  Change  Resilience  Trust  Fund2 (UCCRTF)  under  the  Urban  Financing  Partnership \nFacility,  and  (ii) technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity  Development  for  Industrial  Corridor \nManagement in Andhra Pradesh, and if the Board approves the proposed MFF and PBL, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant \nand the TA. \n \n2.  The VCICDP will complement the ongoing efforts of the Government of Andhra Pradesh \n(GoAP) to enhance industrial growth and create high-quality jobs.3 The MFF and the grant will \nsupport  priority  infrastructure  investments  in  the  Visakhapatnam\u2013Chennai  Industrial  Corridor \n(VCIC), and the PBL will support policy reforms and institutional development in the state. \n  \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  India\u2019s manufacturing sector. While India has seen a rapid structural transformation \nand  achieved  strong  economic  growth  since  1991,  it  must  continue  to  create  economic \nopportunities for its large labor force, which is increasing by about 12 million a year, to sustain its \neconomic growth and realize its demographic dividend.4 With limited prospects for job creation in \nagriculture, one of the most pressing policy challenges is to create more productive and well-\npaying  jobs  in  manufacturing  and  services.  Although  India\u2019s  services  sector  has  grown \nsignificantly since 1991,5 manufacturing, which has higher untapped potential, has lagged with a \ncontribution of about 15% to gross domestic product (GDP) and 12% to employment each year \nover  this  period. 6  India\u2019s  National  Manufacturing  Policy  (2011)  calls  for  increasing  the \nmanufacturing  sector\u2019s  contribution  to  at  least  25%  of  GDP  and  enhancing  job  creation  in \nmanufacturing to create 100 million additional jobs by 2022.7 \n \n4.  India\u2019s  industrial  corridors  and  policies  to  stimulate  manufacturing.  India  has \nadopted an industrial corridor approach to stimulate manufacturing and an Act East policy to \nintegrate the Indian economy with Asia\u2019s dynamic global production networks.8 The industrial \ncorridor approach involves the creation of an efficient multimodal transport network supported by \nquality infrastructure and logistics within a defined geography, and a policy framework that \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Financing partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the   \nUnited States. \n3  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2010.

Report of the Working Group on Employment, Planning and \nPolicy for the Twelfth Five Year Plan (2012\u20132017). Delhi. The current total labor force is about 530 million. \n5  The share of the services in India\u2019s GDP increased from 30% in the 1950s to 45% in FY1991 and 53% in FY2013. \n6  Manufacturing in the People\u2019s Republic of China, Malaysia, and Viet Nam contributes 25% or more to their GDPs. \n7  Government of India, Ministry of Commerce and Industry. 2011. National Manufacturing Policy, 2011. Delhi. \n8  Details on the industrial corridor approach are available at http://www.makeinindia.com/live-projects-industrial-\ncorridor. The government launched five industrial corridors in its FY2015 budget. Under the Act East policy, India \nplans to have greater strategic role for broader economic and diplomatic engagement across Asia and the Pacific. \n ", "2   \nfacilitates business operations for integration with global production networks. Industrial corridors \nare central to India\u2019s Make in India initiative, which encourages investments in the manufacturing \nsector  to  stimulate  growth  and  create  high-quality  jobs.  In  line  with  these  policies,  the \ngovernment  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  identified  the  East  Coast  Economic \nCorridor  (ECEC)\u2014India\u2019s  first  coastal  corridor\u2014extending  over  2,500  kilometers  (km)  from \nKolkata in West Bengal to Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu. The ECEC aims to stimulate growth through \nnetwork externalities, linkage with urban and industrial clusters, and by integrating with regional \nvalue  chains  in  Southeast  and  East  Asia.9 The  VCIC,  which  covers more than  800 km of \ncoastline in Andhra Pradesh, is proposed to be developed as the first phase of the ECEC.10 \n \n5.  Challenges to sustaining industrial growth in Andhra Pradesh. In the state of Andhra \nPradesh, which has 49.4 million people making it the 10th most populous state in India, the \nmanufacturing sector contributes 12% to the state\u2019s GDP\u2014lagging the national average of 15%. \nThe GDP of combined Andhra Pradesh, for which data are available, grew by 7.1% per year \nfrom FY2003 to FY2013, but only contributed about 4% to national industrial output.11 There is a \npertinent  need  to  usher  in  greater  degree  of  industrialization  in  the  state  by  addressing \nchallenges  such  as  low  industrial  diversification,  and  concentration  of  manufacturing  sector \nemployment  in  small,  labor-intensive,  informal  enterprises  with  low  skills,  productivity,  and \nearnings. Key infrastructure in industrial clusters remains inadequate to support the burgeoning \ndemand for efficient industrial infrastructure and robust skills inventory. In a recent survey, \nAndhra Pradesh was ranked second among all states in India for ease of doing business. 12 \nHowever, it needs to further improve its procedures for doing business, labor-related laws, land \nmanagement, and taxation laws if it is to enhance its competitiveness and benchmark itself with \nother countries in the region such as Singapore, the Republic of Korea, and Malaysia.13  \n6.  Policy framework, sector road map, and investment plan for the state. The Andhra \nPradesh Industrial Development Policy (2015) aims to establish state-of-the art infrastructure, \npromote  manufacturing,  enhance  inclusivity,  foster  innovation,  and  create  employment \nopportunities across sectors.14 The GoAP has prepared a comprehensive industrial sector road \nmap, strategic context, policy framework and investment plan to enhance industrial growth and \ncreate high-quality jobs.15  With support from ADB, the GoAP has also prepared a conceptual \ndevelopment plan and a regional perspective plan for the VCIC, which include an infrastructure \n                                                \n9  Asian  Development  Bank  Institute.  2015.

India  was \nranked 142 among 189 nations in a recent survey on the ease of doing business (World Bank. 2016. Doing \nBusiness 2016. Washington, DC). \n13 An important indicator of competitiveness is the time required to start a business: 21.0 days in Andhra Pradesh and \n29.0 days in India, compared with 2.5 days in Singapore and 4.0 days in the Republic of Korea and Malaysia.

", "3 \nstrategy to drive economic growth and the identification of nodes16 for industrial development, \nhigh-potential industrial sectors, and a set of priority projects.17 The conceptual development \nplan indicates that the VCIC, with its long coastline and strategically located ports, provides \nmultiple international gateways to connect India with vibrant global production networks and to \nfacilitate  regional  integration.  The  regional  perspective  plan  has  identified  the  VCIC\u2019s  high \npotential for generating additional employment and industrial output, which can be achieved from \n2015 to 2045.18 ADB is continuing its support to the GoAP for policy reforms, improving ease of \ndoing business, master planning of the identified industrial nodes, and adopting good practices \nfor management of economic corridors. The VCICDP, which combines an MFF and a PBL, will \nbuild on the existing concentration of industries and increase the density and flow of economic \nactivities along the VCIC in a business-induced scenario against a business-as-usual scenario.   \n \n7.  The MFF is an appropriate modality because (i) the GoAP has a policy framework and a \nsector road map for infrastructure investments and reforms; (ii) the investments are significant \nbut sequenced, allowing the GoAP to use a phased approach with a well-defined financial \nenvelope; (iii) it allows ADB to have long-term engagement and continuous policy dialogue; and \n(iv) it enhances project readiness, reduces transaction costs, and supports capacity building. The \nPBL  will  complement  the  MFF  through  comprehensive  state-wide  reforms  and  institutional \ndevelopment to help the VCIC realize its full potential for growth and competitiveness.19 The PBL \nis justified based on (i) the financial support required to prepare, implement, and monitor the \nproposed  policy  actions;  (ii) assessment  of  the  GoAP\u2019s  overall  financial  resources;  (iii) \ndevelopment financing needs in the industrial sector; (iv) the GoAP\u2019s absorptive capacity; and \n(v) the requirement for capacity building of institutions in the industrial sector. The VCICDP is in \nline with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India.20  \nB.  Impact and Outcome   \n8.  The impact of the VCICDP will be an increased contribution of the manufacturing sector \nto  the  state\u2019s  GDP,  trade,  and  employment.21 The  outcome  will  be  enhanced  growth  and \ncompetitiveness of the VCIC.  \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The VCICDP will have three outputs. The PBL will support output 1, and the MFF and the \ngrant will support outputs 2 and 3. The PBL will have two tranches each with 12 policy actions. \n                                                \n16  A node refers to a geographical area along the industrial corridor with high growth potential and encompassing a \nproduction enclave, an urban center, and a port along with a logistics and distribution network. Four nodes have \nbeen identified in the VCIC: Visakhapatnam, Kakinada, Amaravati region, and Yerpedu\u2013Srikalahasti. An industrial \ncluster refers to an identified geographical area of industrial units within a node. \n17  The conceptual development plan is available on the GoAP website.  https://www.apindustries.gov.in/APIndus/ \nData/Vizag-Chennai Industrial Corridor_Full Report.pdf.

Project 1, which is representative of subprojects to be financed under the MFF,23 will \nprimarily focus on two of the four VCIC nodes.24 The industrial area investments reflect the need \nfor high-quality internal infrastructure within the industrial clusters. Project 1 will finance the \ncommon  industrial  effluent  treatment  facility  in  Atchutapuram  and  Naidupeta  clusters,  and \nstrengthen  services  (drainage,  internal  connectivity,  internal  water  supply,  and  the  service \ncenter) in Naidupeta cluster. Project 1 includes strengthening and widening of the Samarlakota\u2013\nRajanagaram section (29.6 km) of the state highway to four lanes to improve connectivity from \nKakinada Port to National Highway 16. It will also upgrade seven power substations to supply \nhigh-quality  and  reliable  power  to  Visakhapatnam,  Naidupeta,  and  Yerpedu\u2013Srikalahasti \nindustrial  clusters.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n18.  The  proposed  TA  for  Capacity  Development  for  Industrial  Corridor  Management  in \nAndhra Pradesh will support the implementation of policy reforms, including those under the \nPBL. It will have three outputs: (i) institutions for corridor management strengthened, (ii) ease of \ndoing business improved, and (iii) capacity building support provided. The TA is estimated to \ncost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF-others). The GoAP will provide counterpart staff, office space, venues, and other in-\nkind contributions. The DOIC will be the executing agency for the TA. It will be implemented over \n3 years during the PBL implementation.30 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n19.  Technical due diligence included a comprehensive review of the subprojects\u2019 feasibility \nstudies, detailed engineering designs and cost estimates, and surveys and site investigations. \nFor  Project  1  subprojects,  technical  aspects  were  examined  on,  among  others:  (i)  specific \ncomponents  in  terms  of  relevance,  benefits,  ease  of  implementation,  and  operations; \n(ii) technical alternatives; (iii) the life cycle costs and achievable cost savings; (iv) maximizing \nbeneficiaries; and (v) minimizing adverse environmental and social impacts. To enhance the \nreadiness of future investment projects, a project development mechanism will be established.31 \n \n20.  In the industries sector, the designs of the common effluent treatment facilities comply \nwith marine and inland discharge standards, and have been optimized for expansion of industrial \nunits. The new power substations and transmission lines are optimally planned to meet the \nincrease  in  electricity  demand  expected  in  the  identified  industrial  clusters.  For  the  road \nsubprojects, the designs have been optimized to minimize the resettlement impacts. Reflecting \nthe GoAP\u2019s priorities of reducing road crash incidents, a road safety improvement program \nfocusing on education, enforcement, engineering, and emergency has been included in the MFF. \nFor the urban sector, investments have been prioritized in Visakhapatnam based on the city\u2019s \ndevelopment plan, which includes smart city and climate-resilient planning. Andhra Pradesh \nState Skill Development Corporation, the nodal agency for skills development, will facilitate \ncapacity building and skills enhancement of workers, entrepreneurs, and students.32  \n \n                                                \n30  Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Details are in the Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n32  A policy action under the PBL is the preparation and implementation of a road map for skills development. \n ", "8   \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  Economic analysis. The estimated economic internal rates of return of four sample \nProject 1 subprojects, one in each sector, range from 15.2% to 37.0%, higher than the economic \nopportunity  cost  of  capital,  estimated  at  12.0%,  indicating  sufficient  economic  return.33 The \nresults are satisfactory against downside risks, including a 20% increase in capital expenditure, a \n20% increase in operating costs, a 20% decrease in benefits, and a 1-year delay. \n \n22.  Financial  analysis.  The  financial  internal  rates  of  return  for  the  sample  Project  1 \nsubprojects in the industrial infrastructure and power sector range from 5.6% to 5.9%, higher \nthan the weighted average cost of capital, indicating sufficient financial return.34 The results of \nthe  sensitivity  analysis  for  these  sectors  are  satisfactory  against  downside  risks  including \nincreases in capital expenditure and operation and maintenance costs, and construction delay. \nFor the urban and road sector subprojects, user charges are not expected to recover operation \nand  maintenance  costs.  A  cash flow  analysis,  including  own  revenues  and  institutionalized \ntransfers from the GoAP to the GVMC and APRDC, is more relevant and confirms that both the \nAPRDC and GVMC have the financial capacity to sustain the services.   \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  A financial management assessment of the DOIC, PMU, and PIUs shows that they have \nadequate capacity and expertise to implement the MFF, and the overall risk is moderate. A \nfinancial management action plan has been prepared to guide the PMU and PIUs on financial \nmanagement. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the Government of India and the GoAP. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the FAM. Based on the risk assessments, some of the \nmitigation measures in the VCICDP design aim to (i) enhance capacity of PMU and PIU staff in \nprogram accounting, reporting, and policies and procedures of ADB; (ii) improve audit processes \nof PIUs; and (iii) establish a mechanism, including a website, for regular voluntary disclosure of \nrelevant information to enhance transparency in project implementation. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n24.  Poverty in the state is estimated at 13.7%.35 The VCICDP will contribute to poverty \nreduction through infrastructure development, and policy and institutional reforms to stimulate \neconomic  growth  and  employment  generation.36 It  will  provide  vulnerable  groups,  including \nwomen, enhanced access to skills development and employment opportunities. Project 1 of the \nMFF and the PBL are classified as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender equality and social \ninclusion action plan37 and a consultation and participation plan  38 have been prepared with \ntargets,  responsibilities,  and  resource  allocation  for  widespread,  ongoing,  and  meaningful \nparticipation. The GoAP will implement these plans, with support from the project management \nand supervision consultant, and nongovernment and civil society organizations. \n                                                \n33 Details are in Economic Analysis: Project 1 of the Multitranche Financing Facility (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n34 Details are in Financial Analysis: Project 1 of the Multitranche Financing Facility (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n35  Government of India, Planning Commission. 2014.

A resettlement framework39 and indigenous peoples planning \nframework40 have been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \nand applicable laws. Four resettlement plans and two due diligence reports for Project 1 have \nbeen prepared in line with the Safeguard Policy Statement, and will be updated after detailed \ndesigns. 41  Project  1  resettlement  impacts  comprise  2,632  affected  persons,  including \n1,182 significantly  affected,  the  acquisition  of  14.5  hectares  of  private  land,  and  impact  on \n367 structures. The proposed mitigation measures, including capacity building of the PMU and \nPIUs, are adequate to address the assessed risks. The safeguard documents are disclosed on \nthe ADB website, and relevant information will be shared with the affected persons. The PBL is \ncategorized as C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples, as it is not anticipated to \nhave any impacts.42   \n \n26.  Environmental safeguards. Project 1 of the MFF is categorized as B for environment in \naccordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement. An environmental assessment and review \nframework has been prepared for the MFF in line with the Safeguard Policy Statement and \napplicable  laws. 43  Four  initial  environmental  examination  reports  prepared  for  Project  1 \nsubprojects  show  that  the  subprojects  are  not  likely  to  cause  any  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impacts, and any impacts during construction and operation can be mitigated \nthrough appropriate design and good practices. Public consultations were conducted for all \nProject 1 subprojects during preparation of the MFF. The initial environmental examinations, \nincluding  the  environmental  management  plan,  are  considered  sufficient  to  meet  the \nenvironmental assessment requirements of ADB and the government. The PBL is categorized as \nB for environment, and measures will be taken for the assessment and mitigation of likely \ninduced impacts resulting from the expected increase in industrialization (footnote 42). \n \n27.  Disasters caused by natural hazards and climate change. Andhra Pradesh coastal \nareas are prone to tropical cyclones,  which can lead to significant losses. Climate change \nprojections indicate an increase in temperature of 2.24\u00ba Celsius and an increase in mean annual \nprecipitation of 81 millimeters by 2050 in Andhra Pradesh.44 The key risk factors are sea level \nrise,  rising  temperatures,  and  increased  frequency  of  flooding  and  tropical  cyclones.  The \nVCICDP  will  incorporate  appropriate  measures  for  risks  related  to  earthquakes,  landslides, \nfloods, tsunami, storm surges, and climate change.   \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n28.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.45 The fiduciary risk for the PBL is medium; the \nstate government\u2019s public financial management systems are adequate to mitigate such risks. \n                                                \n39  Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n40  Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n41 Resettlement Plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n42 Environmental and Social Assessment of the Policy Matrix and Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n43  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n44  Climate Change Risk Screening\u2013 Climate Change Project Adaptation Action Report (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n45 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \nThe integrated project benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDelays in project  GoAP will assign qualified staff to PMU and PIUs, and minimize staff turnover.
