The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is needed to  undertake sector \npreparatory work and define the scope of the proposed City Region Development Project II \n(CRDP II). The PPTA will carry out due diligence on technical, economic, financial, governance, \nsafeguards,  gender,  and  social  aspects  for  the  ensuing  project.  Assisting  the  target  city \ncorporations/pourashavas (secondary towns) along the Southwest Economic Corridor is an \nintegral  part  of  project  preparation,  without  which  the  project  implementation  may  face \nsignificant start-up delays. Project Design Advance (PDA) is also proposed for the project. The \nPPTA and PDA schedules are synchronized to maximize knowledge transfer. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.  The  PPTA  will  conduct  technical,  financial,  economic,  social,  environmental  due \ndiligence, and develop resilience criteria for prioritization and selection of subprojects. The \npriority  subprojects  will  be  identified  with  cost  estimates.  Environmental  and  involuntary \nresettlement classification for the project will be finalized, and safeguards documents will be \nprepared. The PPTA will enhance project readiness by assisting the Government of Bangladesh \nin undertaking advance actions, including identification of lands for project facilities. The Cities \nDevelopment Initiative for Asia (CDIA) has assisted in the preparation of a sector assessment, \nroad  maps,  and  investment  plan,  and  a  pre-feasibility  study  for  Khulna  and  Gazipur  city \ncorporations.1 The PPTA will consider the CDIA study outputs to perform the abovementioned \ntasks.  \n \n3.  The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table A3.1.  \n \nTable A3.1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \n(including Cities Development Initiative for Asia Activities) \nMajor  Activities  (CDIA  tasks  shown  in  Expected  Expected \nitalics to show links to the PPTA)  Completion Date  Major Outputs  Completion Date \n1.

Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement \n \n4.  The PPTA is estimated to cost $612,500 equivalent, of which $400,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and $212,500 will be financed on a grant basis by the Netherlands Trust Fund \nunder the Water Financing Partnership Facility (WFPF) and administered by ADB. The funding \nfor  $212,500  from  the  Netherlands  Trust  Fund  under  WFPF  has  been  approved.  The \ngovernment  will  provide  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  and  housing \naccommodation,  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance,  provision  of  office  space, \ncommunication facilities for consultants, and other in-kind contributions.

Consulting Services \n \n5.  The PPTA will require about 60 person-months of consulting services (21 international \nand  39  national).  ADB  will  recruit  consultants  on  firm  and  individual  basis,  who  will  work \ntogether with the PDA consulting firm to achieve better cooperation. All consultants will be \nrecruited in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development \nBank and Its Borrowers (2013, as amended from time to time). International experts (12 person-\nmonths) and national experts (33 person-months) should provide the services through a firm. An \ninternational firm will be recruited using quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality-\ncost ratio of 90:10 and will require bio-data technical proposal. The consulting firm will be \nengaged to undertake technical, financial, economic, and safeguards due diligence; individual \nconsultants (9 person-months international and 6 national) will take independent assignment \nand provide assistance in quality control and enhance project readiness (Table A3.3). \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"Producer": "GPL Ghostscript 9.14", "CreationDate": "D:20161216175117+08'00'", "ModDate": "D:20161216175117+08'00'", "Author": "ADB", "Creator": "PDF24 Creator", "Title": "Concept paper", "Keywords": "adb project concept paper"}}
