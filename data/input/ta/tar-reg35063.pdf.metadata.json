INTRODUCTION\n1.  In May 2000, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a small-scale technical\nassistance  (TA)1  to  conduct  a  feasibility  study  for  the  Establishment  of  Backbone\nTelecommunications Networks Project-Phase I (Phase-I Backbone Project). In December 2000,\na  steering  committee  meeting  comprising  representatives  from  Greater  Mekong  Subregion\n(GMS) countries and ADB discussed the draft report of the feasibility study. The committee\nconcluded  that  a  well-designed  and  firm  sector  policy  that  provides  a  clear  timetable  for\nliberalizing the telecommunications market and establishing an independent regulatory body, is\na  precondition  for  expected  benefits  from  the  Phase-I  Backbone  Project  to  accrue  to  the\nconsumer. Accordingly, the participants agreed that the telecommunications sector policy study,\nwhich would assist Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Republic and Viet Nam in establishing their sector\npolicy,  should  precede  the  Phase-I  Backbone  Project.  During  the  Fifth  Meeting  of  the\nSubregional Telecommunications Forum (STCF) held on 21-22 February 2001 in Bangkok,\nThailand, the ADB Mission discussed with country representatives the basic concept of the\ntelecommunications sector policy study, and formulated this TA. The Regional TA Screening\nCommittee endorsed the TA on 24 August, 2001.2  The TA framework is attached as Appendix\n1.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2.  Since the six GMS countries began the GMS Program to promote economic cooperation\nin 1992, substantial progress has been made in the telecommunications sector: (i) completion of\nthe Telecommunications Sector Study; (ii) establishment of the STCF, which will serve as an\nadvisory forum to develop and foster cooperation between the GMS countries; (iii) agreement\non priority telecommunications projects and TA in the sector; (iv) completion of the East Loop\nFeasibility Study; (v) revision of priority telecommunications projects; and (vi) completion of the\nfeasibility study for the Phase-I Backbone Project.\n3.  The Telecommunications Sector Study, completed in 1995, envisioned a modern, high-\ncapacity network based on optical fiber transmission systems, configured in a ring topology, and\nemploying synchronous digital hierarchy technology and standards.3 Thirteen transmission links\ngrouped into three loops (East Loop, West Loop, and North Loop) and an interconnection were\nidentified for implementation. The East Loop Project was given the highest priority. In 1997,\nADB approved TA4 to assess the feasibility of the East Loop Project.\n4.  The final report for the feasibility study was presented at the Fourth STCF held in\nVientiane in November 1999; the participants agreed to revise the STCF work plan, established\non the basis of the loop concept, to speed up the building of backbone transmission lines in the\nGMS  region  and  maximize  the  development  impact  of  telecommunications  networks.  The\noriginal 13 projects were regrouped into two phased projects, the Establishment of Backbone\nTelecommunications  Networks  Project-Phase  I  and  Phase  II,  taking  into  account  the\nrecommendation of the East Loop feasibility study and recent developments made on a national\nlevel in the GMS countries.\n                  \n1  TA 5915-REG: GMS Establishment of Backbone Telecommunications Networks Project-Phase I, for $150,000,\napproved on 17 May 2000.\n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 20 February 2001.\n3  SDH is a digital transmission standard that supports voice, video, and data communications; it is designed for\nmigration to higher data rates as would be required to expand existing services and add new ones.\n4  TA 5738-REG: East Loop Telecommunications Project in the GMS, for $820,000, approved on 28 May 1997.", "2\n5.  During the Fourth STCF, the causal relationship between telecommunications sector\ndevelopment and economic growth in the GMS countries was reaffirmed. Telecommunications\nshould be seen as a strategic factor of production central to the development process and\npoverty  reduction  because  of  its  role  as  a  vehicle  for  trade  in  other  service  sectors.\nTelecommunications costs that are continuously falling owing to technological advance, provide\ndeveloping  countries  with  an  opportunity  to  leapfrog  stages  of  network  development.\nTelecommunications  and  information  systems  are  thus  considered  a  necessary  asset  for\neconomic growth of developing countries.\n6.  Despite this large potential of telecommunications for economic growth, provision of\naccess to telecommunications and information systems in the GMS region barely kept abreast\nof a desired level of growth. At the Fourth STCF, the participants had an in-depth discussion\nabout how to spur the growth of the penetration of telecommunications. Participants agreed that\ninsufficient provision of access in the GMS region could be attributed to lack of a firm national\ntelecommunications sector policy, lack of competition in the telecommunications market, and\nlack of transparent regulation in the telecommunications sector. The participants also agreed\nthat the top priority should then be given to correction of this policy failure in order to promote\nthe growth of penetration in the GMS region. The same effort is being made by World Trade\nOrganization  member  countries  by  signing  the  basic  telecommunications  agreement  for\nprogressive opening of the basic telecommunications market to competitive entry and increased\nforeign investment.\n7.  In consequence, the Fourth STCF decided to adopt the following telecommunications\nsector regulatory principles as a benchmark for the regulatory reforms for the GMS countries: (i)\nmaintaining  appropriate  measures  to  prevent  anticompetition  practices;  (ii)  providing  for\nnondiscriminatory and cost-oriented interconnection; (iii) applying universal service obligation in\na competitively neutral, nondiscriminatory, and transparent manner; (iv) making licensing criteria\npublicly  available;  (v)  establishing  a  separate  regulatory  body;  and  (vi)  allocating  scarce\nresources in an objective, timely, transparent, and nondiscriminatory manner.\n8.  Meanwhile, the convergence of computer and communications technology, which took\nplace in the 1990s, reinforced the importance of a pro-competition telecommunications sector\npolicy in place. Rapid advancement of information and communications technology (ICT) led to\nthe  dramatic  expansion  of  the  Internet  and  the  World  Wide  Web  (WWW),  and  the  rapid\ndeployment of wireless networks. While the telephone needed almost 75 years to reach 50\nmillion users, the World Wide Web only 4 years to reach the same number.5 Literally the\nnetworking revolution is taking place. With the emergence of the Internet, the economic effects\nof communications networking become far greater. Now telecommunications are no longer a\nluxury to developing countries. The impact on economic growth and poverty reduction becomes\nenormous in developing countries. ICT (i) enables an economy to reduce costs and increase\nmarket coverage, facilitating the achievement of economies of scale and scope; (ii) allows the\npoor to access markets, to receive education, and to learn new skills; (iii) gives the poor a voice\nthat enables them to use their knowledge and strengths to escape poverty traps; and (iv)\nprovides rural populations with access to information such as crop prices, the weather, and new\nfarming techniques that can be translated into improved income. In short, ICT poses a great\nopportunity for developing countries to leapfrog stages of economic development.\n                  \n5  Pyramid Research. 1999. Will the Internet Close the Gap? Report prepared for InfoDev, World Bank. Washington\nDC.", "3\n9.  However, developing countries also face a threat. The digital divide between developed\nand developing countries is so huge that many sceptics warn of the danger of continuing digital\ndivergence between them. Bridging the digital divide looms as a daunting task for developing\ncountries not to be excluded from the digital revolution. The significant barrier to expanding\nconnectivity in many developing countries is again a result of policy failure, lack of competition\nin the telecommunications market, and lack of appropriate regulation. Many studies have shown\nthat  countries  with  a  highly  liberalized  telecommunications  network  have  costs  of  Internet\naccess several times lower than those with a completely closed market. Countries with more\nopen telecommunications sectors also have more host sites, lower monthly Internet charges, a\ngreater number of service providers, and higher rates of Internet penetration. With a poorly\ndesigned telecommunications policy in place, developing countries will hardly be able to bridge\nthe digital divide and easily end up falling into a vicious cycle of digital divergence. With this\ngloomy picture on the horizon, developing countries have no time to waste and should not delay\ntelecommunications sector reform through which a firm national telecommunications sector\npolicy will be established that supports fair competition in the telecommunications market with\nappropriate regulation.\n10.  Despite the resolution of the Fourth STCF on reform of the telecommunications sector\nwith the application of the agreed regulatory principles, progress to date is no more than\nmodest. The approach was piecemeal, failing to comprehend the dynamics of introducing a\nsector reform program in the GMS countries. The owner of the reform program was not properly\nmotivated, and more seriously, was incapable of designing and implementing a sector reform\nprogram.  Telecommunications  sector  reform  would  not  succeed  unless  launched  in  a\ncomprehensive manner with a strong conviction of a national champion. With this view in mind,\ncountry representatives agreed, during the Steering Committee Meeting for TA 5915 (footnote\n1) held in December 2000, that the telecommunications sector policy study, already proposed\nas part of the Phase-I Backbone Project, should be conducted with top priority prior to the\nphysical investment project. The result of the study, comprehensive telecommunications sector\npolicy  guidelines  and  a  country-specific  telecommunications  sector  reform  program,  will\ncomprise the policy dialogue to formulate the Phase-I Backbone Project.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n11.  The TA\u2019s objective is to assist the governments of Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic\nRepublic, and Viet Nam (the TA countries), which will participate in the Phase-I Backbone\nProject,  in  preparing  a  telecommunications  sector  policy,  telecommunications  act,  and\ntelecommunications sector reform program.\nB. Scope\n12.  The TA comprises four parts. Part I is to prepare comprehensive telecommunications\nsector policy guidelines for the TA countries to harmonize telecommunications sector policy in\nthe subregion as a strategy to develop telecommunications infrastructure and services. The\npolicy guidelines will cover four subjects: (i) policy objectives applicable in the TA countries in\nthe  light  of  promoting  the  development  of  telecommunications  systems  and  services  in\naccordance  with  recognized  international  standards,  practices,  and  public  demand  on  a\nsubregional  level;  (ii)  establishment  in  each  country  of  an  autonomous  and  independent\nregulatory  authority  and  its  mandate  and  mission,  functions,  organizational  structure,\ncomposition,  relation  to  government,  and  funding  of  its  operation;  (iii)  restructuring  the", "4\ntelecommunications  industry  including  corporatization  and  privatization  of  government\ntelecommunications operators; and (iv) prioritization of the regulatory agenda such as universal\naccess, tariffs, interconnection, frequency spectrum, numbering plan, licensing, and standards\nenforcement.\n13.  Part II is to prepare comprehensive telecommunications sector legislative guidelines for\nthe TA countries to formulate principal legislation for implementing telecommunications sector\npolicy. Along with the guidelines, model telecommunications acts will be prepared for each TA\ncountry to support the telecommunications sector reform program developed by the TA.\n14.  Part III is to develop a country-specific telecommunications sector reform program that\nwill spell out (i) the sequence of industry restructuring together with a time-bound action plan in\nconsideration of the World Trade Organization agreement on trade in basic telecommunications\nservices;  and  (ii)  the  process  of  establishing  an  autonomous  regulatory  authority  with  a\ntimetable. Along with this sector reform program, a public awareness campaign program will be\nprepared  targeting  employees  of  related  government  ministries  and  government\ntelecommunications operator, as well as the general public.\n15.  Part IV is to prepare short, medium, and long-term human resource development plans\nto upgrade technical, operational, managerial, and planning capacity of human resources in the\ntelecommunications ministry, the regulatory authority, and the government telecommunications\nservice operator. During TA implementation, workshops will be held to train personnel of the\ntelecommunications ministry, regulatory authority, and government service operator in the TA\ncountries  about  sector  policy  issues  including  regulatory  principles,  restructuring  of  the\ntelecommunications  industry,  and  telecommunications  legislation.  The  workshops  will  be\norganized in consultation with the International Telecommunication Union in Bangkok, which will\nprovide technical assistance.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16.  The estimated total cost of the TA is $750,000 equivalent, of which the foreign exchange\ncomponent  is  $630,000  and  the  local  currency  component  $120,000  equivalent  (detailed\nestimates are in Appendix 2). ADB will finance $700,000 equivalent on a grant basis from the\nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan to cover $630,000 of the foreign\nexchange cost and $70,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The governments of the TA\ncountries will provide a total of $50,000 equivalent in kind for office space, secretarial services,\ncounterpart staff, office supplies, local communications, and local transportation.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n17.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  Each  TA  country  will  appoint  an\nImplementing Agency (IA) to coordinate day-to-day TA implementation. Each IA will appoint a\nTA manager who will act as a focal point for TA implementation. The TA will be guided by a\nsteering committee to be formed prior to the commencement of work. The steering committee\nwill be comprised of high-level representatives appointed by each TA country and ADB. The\nsteering committee meeting, cochaired by one of the government representatives and ADB, will\nreview consultant\u2019s reports, reconcile the different views of the IAs and ADB, provide feedback\nto the consultants, and guide the direction of TA implementation. The consultants will attend the\nsteering  committee  meetings  with  broad  responsibility  for  liaison  and  coordination  among\ncommittee members. The steering committee meetings will be convened at TA inception and\ncompletion. Each member can call a meeting on a need basis.", "5\n18.  The TA will be carried out by international and domestic consultants to be recruited by\nADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Seventeen person-months of\ninternational consulting services will be required with expertise in (i) telecommunications sector\nreform, (ii) regulatory policy in the telecommunications sector, and (iii) telecommunications\nlegislation;  24  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  required  for  (i)  a\ntelecommunications economist, and (ii) a legal specialist from each of the three TA countries.\nOutline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.\n19.  The international consultants are expected to make one country their main base and\nmake periodic trips to each of the other countries as work demands. The IA of the base country\nwill  provide  necessary  office  facilities,  including  office  furnishings  suitable  for  up  to  three\ninternational consultants and two domestic consultants. In the other countries, the IA will provide\ntemporary office accommodation. Each IA will assign a team of counterpart staff to work with\nthe consultants on the day-to-day conduct of the study when working in that country. Consulting\nservices are expected to commence on February 2002 and be completed on 31 July 2002.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n20.
