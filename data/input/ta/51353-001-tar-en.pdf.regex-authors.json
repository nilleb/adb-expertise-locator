INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the preparation of an \nIntegrated Water Master Plan in Astana, Republic of Kazakhstan, to ensure water security for \nAstana\u2019s sustainable economic development and increasing demand for water as a result of rapid \nurbanization and population growth. \n \n2.  Astana City Akimat (ACA), with the endorsement of the Government of Kazakhstan, has \nrequested assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to prepare an Integrated Water \nMaster Plan for Astana City based on advanced international knowledge to improve the planning \nand management of its water resources.1 The plan is to include the upgrade of the water supply \nand sanitation infrastructure, improvement of the city drainage systems, mitigation of flood risks, \nuse of storm and snow-melted water, and reuse of treated wastewater.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Astana, the capital city of Kazakhstan, covers more than 722 square kilometers and its \npopulation in 2017 was about 1.1 million. The ACA forecasts that the city will expand to 2 million \npeople by the year 2050.3 Astana lies in low floodplain terraces in arid steppes, and its climate is \nsharply continental\u2014cold and long winters, hot and moderately dry summers. The Ishim River \nflows across the city and is its major source of water. Part of Astana city also falls in the catchment \nof the Nura River. The Ishim River originates in the Niaz Mountains in Karaganda Province of \nKazakhstan. It is 2,450 kilometers (km) long passing through Kazakhstan and Russia, including \n1,717 km in the Akmola and North Kazakhstan oblasts of Kazakhstan.  \n \n4.  Astana\u2019s economy and population are growing fast, increasing pressure on ensuring water \nsecurity. The ACA has been investing in water infrastructure since 2009, including constructing \nflood dikes, wastewater treatment plants, and water supply networks. However, flood risks remain \nserious due to a bottleneck for flood flows in the lower section of the Ishim River and a rapid \nexpansion of the urban center. The ACA has realized the importance of the development and \nadoption  of  a  master  plan  to  strategically  guide  its  water  management  and  water-related \ninvestments. It is necessary to improve the city\u2019s water resources management and expand the \nwater supply and sewage networks through an integrated approach to providing quality services \nto the city\u2019s expected growing population and urbanization.  \n \n5.  Flood risks. A major flood in 1949 washed away the left bank of the Ishim River. With the \nmove of the capital of Kazakhstan from Almaty to Astana in 1997, Astana has become home to \nministries, national companies, and major residential hubs. To enhance the protection of Astana \nby cutting off-peak discharges of flood flows from the Astana Reservoir upstream of the city, a \nflood control dam near the Astana airport was constructed in 2009, with a height of 10 meters (m) \nand length of over 30 m. During the 2017 flood period, about 600 million cubic meters (m3) passed \nthrough the Astana reservoir, while the reservoir has only an effective storage capacity of 135 \nmillion m3. The peak discharge released from the Astana reservoir was 1,910 m3/second, while \nthe total flood outlet capacity of the dam is no more than 450 m3/second and some lower sections \nof the Ishim River within the city have a discharge capacity of less than 65 m3/second. There is \n                                                \n1  Astana City Akimat is the name locally known for Astana City Government. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 December 2017. \n3  Official  Site  of  the  President  of  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan.  Meeting  on  the  Capital  City\u2019s  Development. \nhttp://www.akorda.kz/en/events/astana_kazakhstan/astana_other_events/meeting-on-the-capital-citys-\ndevelopment. \n ", "2 \nalso  a  lack  of  flood  forecasting  and  no  warning  system  or  emergency  plan  for  flood  risk \nmanagement. \n \n6.  Increasing demand for water supply and sanitation. In 2017, piped water supply \nsystems cover 98% of Astana\u2019s population, with 3% of them getting water from street standpipes. \nThe remaining 2% rely on individual wells or pits. About 92% of Astana\u2019s population is connected \nto sewage networks while the remaining 8% discharge directly to septic tanks and cesspools. In \nsome smaller villages, nearly half of households are not connected to sewage networks. Astana \nis facing challenges to meet the increased demand for water as a result of the city\u2019s rapid \neconomic and population growth from 1.1 million in 2017 to potentially 2.0 million in 2050. The \nnetworks and facilities are aging and have high water losses. About one-third of households have \nno meter installed. The ACA estimates that water losses are over 20%. A lack of comprehensive \nwater data, understanding of alternative water sources and integrated technical approaches, and \ninstitutional coordination also limit access to safe and secure water. There is a need to introduce \nuniversal metering and reduce non-revenue water. \n \n7.  Low water tariff. Tariffs for water supply and sewerage for retail consumers in Astana are \nrelatively  low  compared  to  the  other  regions  of  Kazakhstan  and  provide  no  incentive  for \nhouseholds to save water.4 For example, the domestic water supply tariff in 2016 was about T45 \nor $0.13 per cubic meter. There is a need to ensure financial sustainability and to change \nconsumption patterns.   \n \n8.  Weak institutional coordination and data coverage. There is no unified agency for \nintegrated water management at national or Astana city levels. The Ishim River Basin Inspection \nAgency and the Committee for Water Resources of the Ministry of Agriculture are responsible for \nsurface and groundwater resources management at the river basin and country levels, while water \nsupply is mainly the city\u2019s responsibility. Coverage and reliability of hydrological data are poor, \npreventing  strategic  planning  and  management  of  water  resources.  This  fragmented \nmanagement and lack of water data support need to be improved, including coordination and \ninformation sharing between agencies. In addition, Kazakhstan is experiencing a shortage of \nqualified personnel, and there is room to improve management practices and strengthen staff\u2019s \ncapacity. \n \n9.  Resilience and adaptation to climate change. Climate change is projected to have a \nsignificant impact on Kazakhstan\u2019s water resources, exacerbating water shortages. Flood risks \nmay also increase. Global climate scenarios indicate that the projected increase in air temperature \nwill result in changes in the amount, seasonality, intensity, and distribution of precipitation and \nincrease in evaporation. Temperatures are expected to increase by 1.4\u00b0C by 2030 and 2.7\u00b0C by \n2050 from the 2017 levels.5 Flow discharges in the Ishim River, the water source for Astana, may \ndecrease and peak discharges during the flood season may increase.  Astana\u2019s current resilience \nto predicted climate change is low, and adaptation planning is necessary to minimize negative \nimpacts on the population, environment, and the economy. \n \n10.  Lessons.  The  TA  design  has  incorporated  lessons  from  water-related  projects  in \nKazakhstan and other developing member countries financed by ADB, Japan International \nCooperation Agency, United Nations Development Programme, and other international agencies. \nThe lessons include (i) inclusion of public participation and public awareness campaigns on \nimproving  water  management,  (ii)  provision  of  incentives  for  residents  to  use  advanced \n                                                \n4  Utility Department of Astana City Akimat. 2017.
