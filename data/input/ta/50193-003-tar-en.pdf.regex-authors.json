The  transaction  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  assist  Maharashtra  State  Electricity \nDistribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) and the Government of Maharashtra in implementing \nthe Maharashtra Rural High Voltage Distribution System (HVDS) Expansion Program.  \n \n2.  The  government  of  Maharashtra  and  MSEDCL  plan  to  release  all  future  electricity \nconnections for the agriculture sector through high voltage connections. This is the first time that \na HVDS is being taken up in the state. HVDSs reduce losses, improve voltage and improve \nreliability of supply for customers. HVDS adoption also reduces technical barriers to the adoption \nof energy efficient pumps and efficient irrigation techniques. A loan of $346 million is proposed \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance the program. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  ADB proposes to structure the intervention to include linkages between efficient electricity \nsupply and water consumption, monitoring of information from the HVDS dashboard and support \nfor  institutional  strengthening  to  overcome  implementation  challenges. The  TA  will  support                    \n(i) monitoring of the HVDS dashboard and its use by government agencies for decision making; \n(ii) review of the program action plan; and (ii) implementation support for an agriculture feeder \npilot in Maharashtra to support demonstration of efficient energy and irrigation using HVDS \nthrough  \u201cminimum  energy  support  to  maximize  incomes  sustainably\u201d  (MES2MIS)  pilot  and \npotential to scale up HVDS and efficient usage of resources within the state through policy \ninterventions. \n \n4.  In keeping with India\u2019s energy policy vision of meeting energy demand reliably in a \ntechnically  efficient,  economically  viable  and  environmentally  sustainable  manner,  the \nGovernment of Maharashtra, through MSEDCL, proposes to strengthen its distribution system in \nrural areas to ensure an efficient and reliable electricity supply for agricultural customers. The \nGovernment of Maharashtra and MSEDCL have requested that ADB finance the HVDS, using a \nresults-based lending (RBL) approach, to provide reliable and high-quality supply to new rural \ncustomers in Maharashtra. This would be the first RBL for the energy sector in India by ADB.  \n \n5.  Maharashtra has planned the HVDS program to focus on new agricultural customers. \nTechnical modeling indicates that conversion of existing customers to HVDS is also justified to \nreduce losses and improve the quality of supply. The benefits increase when coupled with a \nprogram to replace existing pumps with new energy efficient pumps and incorporate efficient \nirrigation practices, with significant electricity and water-saving potential. A pilot on an agriculture \nfeeder for full replacement to HVDS coupled with efficient pumps and MES2MIS can provide \ndemonstration value to policy makers and prepare the grounds for subsequent phases of the \ngovernment program for widespread adoption of HVDS, coupled with measures for efficient and \nsustainable electricity and water consumption. The TA will contribute to meeting Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals 6, 7 and 13.  \n \n6.  The pilot supports an integrated approach requiring coordination between the energy, \nirrigation and other departments in the state government. It is desirable to provide additional \n ", "2 \nsupport through the TA to support implementation including for the monitoring of the RBL and \nsupport for safeguards reviews. The TA is listed in ADB\u2019s India country operations business plan.1 \n  \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n7.

Cost and Financing \n \n8.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.1 million, of which $1.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF- other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. The \nkey expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1.  \n \n9.  The TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  ADB will administer the TA, and select, supervise, and evaluate consultants. The TA will \nbe implemented over 24 months and is expected to start in April 2020 and end in March 2021.  \n \n11.  The State of Maharashtra, acting through the Energy Department, will be the executing \nagency. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  April 2020 to March 2022 \nExecuting agency  State of Maharashtra acting through Energy Department \nImplementing agencies  Project implementation unit established within MSEDCL. \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB  \nIndividual: Bio-data   13 consultants    $ 0.7 million \nProcurement  To be procured by executing agency \nShopping   3 contracts  $0.3 million \nAdvance contracting   Advance contracting will be used for the consultant recruitment \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time \nto time). \n \n1 ADB. 2019.
