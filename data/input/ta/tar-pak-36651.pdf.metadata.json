The Government of Pakistan requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA)1 for preparing a public-private infrastructure finance project that will \nhelp accelerate infrastructure development through increased private sector participation in \ninfrastructure development in Pakistan, and thereby promote economic growth and reduce \npoverty. Accordingly, a project preparatory TA grant amounting to $400,000 for Public-Private \nInfrastructure Financing Facility was included in the 2003 Country Strategy and Program for \nPakistan. A TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Pakistan during 21 April-5 May 2003 to discuss the \nscope of assistance with various stakeholders in the physical infrastructure sectors at the \nfederal  government  level  as  well  as  the  provincial  governments  of  Punjab  and  Sindh,  in \npreparation for processing the TA. This report reflects the findings of the Mission and the \nunderstanding  reached  with  the  Government  on  objectives,  scope,  cost,  implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Pakistan\u2019s infrastructure is grossly inadequate compared with world standards and has \nbeen  identified  as  one  of  the  critical  reasons  holding  back  more  rapid  economic  growth. \nPakistan's investment rates, low to begin with, declined during much of the 1990s. Overall fixed \ninvestment as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP) fell from 17.5% in FY1991 to \nabout 13% in FY2002, while private investment declined from about 10% of GDP to about 7.6% \nduring that period. Fiscal deficits have been high throughout the 1980s and 1990s, averaging \nabout 6.5% of GDP. As a result the public debt-GDP ratio increased from 66% in the mid-1980s \nto about 97% in mid-2002, impacting development expenditures. Servicing the public debt \ncurrently takes up 64% of the Government\u2019s revenue. As a result, development expenditures \nhave declined from 10% of GDP in FY1981 to about 3% by FY2001.2 \n \n3.  Although public investment in infrastructure has declined as a percentage of GDP since \nthe start of the decade, private investment has failed to fill the gap. As a result, total investment \nin infrastructure, as a percentage of GDP, is below the level in 1991\u20131993 (table). \n \nInvestments in Infrastructure (% of GDP) \n \nItem  FY1992  FY1993  FY1995  FY1997  FY1999  FY2001  FY2002 \nPublic  2.8  4.4  3.4  3.3  1.9  2.3  2.0 \nPrivate  1.0  1.0  1.0  2.1  1.2  1.3  1.2 \nTotal  3.8  5.4  4.4  5.4  3.1  3.6  3.2 \n \n4.  The  infrastructure  sector  of  Pakistan  comprises  power,  telecommunications,  roads, \nports, railways, air transport, water supply, waste management, information technology, cyber \nparks, and industrial estates. Currently, the existing infrastructure is inadequate to satisfy the \nneeds of economic development as well as the demand arising from population growth. The \npublic sector has been the main provider of basic infrastructure. However, the large fiscal deficit \nhas limited the Government\u2019s capacity to meet growing infrastructure needs and has emerged \nas a major constraint to the country's efforts to improve its investment climate. To augment \nlimited public resources for infrastructure, private sector participation must be encouraged by \ncreating the enabling environment for increased private sector involvement. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 17 March 2003. \n2  World Bank. 2003. Improving the Investment Climate in Pakistan. Washington, DC. \n ", "2 \n \n5.  The full potential of the private sector to meet Pakistan\u2019s pressing infrastructure needs is \nlargely untapped. There has been some success in attracting the private sector under build-\noperate-transfer (BOT) type schemes, but instances have been isolated and aided by specific \npolicies and incentives, particularly in power generation in the 1990s. Although the 1994 energy \npolicy allowed quick implementation and access to global capital and technology resources, the \ndrawback  was  the  absence  of  international  competitive  bidding  procedures,  inappropriate \nchoice of fuel, and guaranteed high energy prices to independent power producers (IPPs). The \npayment to the IPPs adversely affected the Government financing of other public enterprises in \nthe sector. The tariff issues with the IPPs have since been amicably resolved. As per the World \nBank assessment of the investment climate, Pakistan will need to invest heavily in distribution \nand transmission, which cannot materialize without restructuring the two public sector power \nutility  companies.  The  present  energy  policy  allows  the  private  sector  in  generation  and \ndistribution, but not in transmission.  \n \n6.  The private sector has built new infrastructure in telecommunications, but basic services \nare still with the state-owned Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation. The cellular phone \nmarket is being opened for private sector participation; however, investments in the sector have \nnot been enough to meet the current demand. A new telecommunication deregulation policy, \nwhich  is  likely  to  be  implemented  shortly,  will  grant  licenses  to  private  fixed-line \ntelecommunication companies, provide a universal access system, and establish a framework \nfor the growth of mobile services.  \n \n7.  The  National  Highway  Authority\u2019s  (NHA\u2019s)  efforts  to  attract  private  participation  in \ndeveloping the road sector has met with limited success. It appears that a more in-depth \nanalysis is needed for assessing impediments in the existing policy, incentives, and legal \nframework. The capacity of the concerned agencies, particularly at the provincial level, to \nconduct prefeasibility studies and prepare road projects for tendering, land  acquisition, and \nsetting the toll fee is the main concern. \n \n8.  Other isolated BOT proposals include setting up an oil terminal at the Karachi Port by \nthe private sector. Recent negotiations for a water treatment plant in Karachi met with setbacks \ndue to lack of risk mitigation tools for investors, while a proposal for an urban mass transit \nsystem in Karachi has not made much headway. Other than the public-private desalination \nproject proposed at Karachi, no projects have emerged for private participation in water supply \nand sanitation although there are attempts to have private sector involvement in solid waste \nmanagement. The Government favors policies for public-private partnership for such municipal \nservices, but BOT and build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) structures remain untested in those \nareas. \n \n9.  Pakistan has restructured the government\u2019s role in power, to a large extent in generation \nbut not in transmission and distribution, and to some extent in telecommunications. In other \nsectors, the process is incomplete or has not yet begun. This separation of roles and the \ncreation  of  independent  regulatory  agencies  will  be  particularly  important  when  there  is \ncompetition between private and publicly owned service providers and when there is a need to \ninsulate tariffs from political pressure. Regulatory authorities have been established for the \npower  and  telecommunication  sectors,  but  their  independence  and  capacity  need  further \nstrengthening. \n \n10.  Countries, such as Pakistan, that for a long time have financed infrastructure projects \ndirectly from fiscal budget allocations often lack the necessary institutional and regulatory ", "      3\ncapacity to facilitate private participation in infrastructure provision. Other reasons why private \nsector infrastructure projects have not materialized follow: (i) reforms have not progressed as \nfast as anticipated; (ii) present governance structures are not suited to broad private sector \nparticipation in infrastructure envisaged in a liberalized environment; (iii)  the public\u2013private \ninterface  needs  substantial  strengthening\u2014shortage  within  the  Government  of  skills  and \ninstitutional mechanisms needed for effective interaction with the private sector; and (iv) it \nremains difficult to disaggregate and allocate risks in the domestic capital market. Not all \nsolutions can be pursued at the national level\u2014some may involve provincial or even municipal \npolicy and institutional reforms. \n \n11.  The focal infrastructure sectors for the provincial governments are mainly the road, water \nsupply and sanitation, and solid waste management sectors where private sector participation is \nto be invited. With the absence of formal or enunciated provincial policy on private sector \nparticipation, none of the provincial governments in Pakistan are equipped to interface with the \nprivate  sector,  as  they  lack  appropriate  institutional  structures  and  processes,  established \nsystems and procedures, and capable dedicated staff. Due to inexperience, the capacity for \npromoting  and  developing  infrastructure  projects  is  limited.  Lack  of  financial  engineering \nexpertise poses difficulties in packaging projects that could be successfully offered for financing. \nProject development is proving to be a very risky and costly exercise. To address these issues, \nthe capacity to formulate institutional frameworks and regulatory structures will be enhanced. \nCredible mechanisms for settling disputes also need to be established. Bidding procedures \nneed to be streamlined and enhanced to meet international best practices, and bankable \nconcession agreements have to be developed. Consistency of legal/regulatory frameworks and \npolicies that engender investor confidence are essential for the country's ability to raise long-\nterm financing for projects, both domestically and internationally. \n \n12.  For reasons mentioned earlier, infrastructure financing will have to rely more on private \nresources. Over the longer term, only an efficient and properly functioning banking sector and \ncapital  market  can  sustain  large-scale  infrastructure  financing.  Due  primarily  to  an \nunderdeveloped market for long-term debt, Pakistan\u2019s capital market capacity is still limited \nrelative to requirements and lacks the necessary depth of instruments and maturity profile to \nmeet the complex and protracted term requirements of infrastructure projects, which typically \nhave very long gestation periods. While good progress in developing a corporate bond market \nwas made over the past 3 years, typical term finance certificates (corporate debt papers issued \nin Pakistan) do not have maturity exceeding 5 years. Some other policy constraints are the \nabsence of a secondary market in debt securities and Government preemption of the funds of \nlarge contractual savings institutions\u2014the main providers of long-term investment funds\u2014for \nfinancing  the  domestic  fiscal  deficit.  The  absence  of  an  active  market  in  long-term  debt \nsecurities accounts for the dearth of local financing in the amount and tenor required to finance \ninfrastructure. However, considering the size of the financing needed for infrastructure, direct \nfinancing from financial institutions would not be sufficient to satisfy the demand, given the \nbalance sheet and credit exposure limitations of these institutions. The alternative would be to \nraise funds directly from the public. To do this would require, in conjunction with ongoing \nreforms,  raising  institutional  capabilities  and  developing  financing  instruments  that  more \nappropriately  meet  the  long-term  financing  requirements  of  infrastructure  projects  so  that \nresources can be mobilized on a sustained basis.  \n \n ", "4 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  The objectives of the project preparatory TA are to help design appropriate mechanisms \nfor accelerating infrastructure development through increased private sector participation in \nPakistan and thereby promote economic growth and reduce poverty. The TA will include \ncomponents that will identify the key constraints to increased private sector participation in \ninfrastructure  development,  identify  the  priorities  that  constitute  the  key  constraints,  and \ndetermine what further assistance is required to address the above constraints to creating the \nenabling  environment  for  private  sector  involvement  in  infrastructure  development.  In  the \nprocess, the policy and regulatory issues as well as the environment for mobilizing long-term \nresources will be reviewed and follow-up measures/interventions that need to be taken by the \nGovernment/local bodies will be recommended.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The  TA  consultants  will,  provide  guidance  in  enhancing  governance  structures  and \npractices, and in strengthening the public-private interface, considering current weaknesses and \ngaps and best practices. The TA components follow: (i) assess the current activities and \nperformance of key infrastructure sectors; (ii) identify and assess the legal, policy, regulatory, \nand institutional impediments in involving the private sector in those sectors, and identify key \nissues  and  priorities  to  be  addressed  with  agreed-upon  action  plans;  (iii)  make \nrecommendations for developing frameworks and sector strategies needed to improve the \ncapacity for efficient and transparent contracting of infrastructure projects to the private sector; \n(iv) recommend measures to strengthen institutional capacity to efficiently channel private \ncapital into long-term infrastructure projects, with agreed-upon action plans; and (v) design \nmechanisms to effectively use ADB\u2019s financing and risk management tools, particularly its \nguarantee instruments to facilitate private sector investments in long-term infrastructure finance. \nThe focus will be on establishing the right market structures and in suggesting changes in \napproaches, institutional reorganizations, and appropriate policy. The TA will also coordinate \nrecommended  measures  with  ADB  infrastructure  divisions  operating  in  the  sectors.  As  a \ndemonstrative effect, the TA will aim to structure and assist in bringing selected projects in road \ninfrastructure to financial closure. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent comprising $345,000 in \nforeign  exchange,  and  $155,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  finance  $400,000 \nequivalent, which includes the entire foreign exchange cost and $55,000  equivalent in local \ncurrency cost. The Government will contribute the remaining $100,000 equivalent, which will \ninclude office accommodation, counterpart staff remuneration, transportation, and surveys. The \nTA will be financed as a grant from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Ministry of Privatization will be the Executing Agency for the TA. TA implementation \nwill be guided by a steering committee headed by the minister of privatization or his designated \nrepresentative, together with officials from The Board of Investments, Ministry of Power and \nNational Electric Power Regulatory Authority, Information Technology and Telecom Division, the ", "      5\nTelecom Regulatory Authority, Ministry of Communications and Ports and NHA, Ministry of \nPublic Water Supply, Ministry of Civil Aviation, representatives from provincial governments \n(Department  of  Communications,  Water  Supply,  Sewerage  Services  and  Solid  Waste \nManagement),  and  representatives  from  the  private    and  financial  sectors.  At  relevant \nmilestones during implementation, the TA consultants will organize at least two workshops for \nall stakeholders, including the provincial governments, to review the results of the TA and the \nrecommended approaches. \n \n17.  The TA is expected to start in November 2003 and be completed in February 2004. The \nconsulting team will include four international consultants (11.5 person-months total) and two \ndomestic  consultants  (5  person-months  total).  International  consultants  will  comprise  an \ninfrastructure/public\u2013private partnership policy expert (the team leader); two regulatory experts \nfocusing particularly on road and water supply, sewerage and solid waste management; and an \ninfrastructure  financing  expert.  The  domestic  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  Pakistan\u2019s \nexisting framework and local financial practices as well as government and political processes, \nfederal-state  relations,  and  municipal  government  administration.  While  the  international \nconsultants will be recruited through a firm\u2014using a simplified technical proposal under the \nquality based selection method in view of the specialized expertise required for the project\u2014the \ndomestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  on  an  individual  basis,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants for recruiting consultants and other arrangements for \nselecting  domestic  consultants.  Appendix  4  gives  the  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants.  \n \n18.  The consultants will submit to the Executing Agency and ADB, within 3 weeks of the \nstart of the services, an inception report that outlines the approach and the key issues to be \naddressed; and an interim report, that presents their preliminary findings and outlines the \ngeneral direction and detailed plan for the TA within 8 weeks of the start of the TA. The draft \nfinal report, to be submitted 2 weeks before the completion of the TA, will have proposals and \naction plans that identify the legal, policy, regulatory and institutional framework that need to be \nimplemented and established. The draft final report will be discussed at a tripartite meeting. The \nfinal report will be submitted after incorporating comments at the end of the consulting period. \n \n19.  Considering the  size and scope of the TA, additional assistance is envisaged as a \nfollow-up  measure  for  creating  the  appropriate  enabling  environment  and  developing \ninstitutional  capacity  to  prepare  the  different  stakeholders  for  the  ADB  Public-Private \nInfrastructure Financing Facility of $200 million, proposed for 2005. To address the above need, \nit is proposed that the TA be complemented by a TA loan in 2004. From the outcome of the TA, \nthe consultant\u2019s final report will provide the framework for the proposed TA loan in 2004, \nincluding detailed terms of references. The TA loan will outline the policy and procedures to \nfollow in preparing a resettlement plan as well as a detailed environment assessment and will \ndesign an environmental management system to comply with ADB\u2019s environment requirements \nfor infrastructure projects.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for preparing the Public-Private Infrastructure Financing Facility, \nand hereby reports such action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \nEconomic growth  Infrastructure  Government reports  Macroeconomy remains \ndevelopment strategies    stable and economic \nset up  Studies conducted by  reforms are sustained. \n  bilateral and multilateral \nEnabling environment  organizations \nfor increased public-  \nprivate partnership in  Asian Development Bank \ninfrastructure  (ADB) review missions \ndevelopment created \n \nSectoral policy, legal \nand regulatory reforms \nto promote private \nparticipation in \ninfrastructure \ndevelopment promoted \n \nIncreased investment in \ninfrastructure \n \nPoverty reduction  Increased employment  Federal/provincial  Government policies are \nin infrastructure  government reports  oriented toward reducing \ngenerated    the incidence of poverty. \n  Studies conducted by \nImproved access to  bilateral and multilateral \ninfrastructure services  organizations \n       \nPurpose       \nEnhance private  Public-private interface  Federal/provincial  Environment remains \nsector participation  strengthened through  government reports  conducive to private \nin infrastructure  improved institutional    investments. \ndevelopment  capacity for efficient  Financial institutions \nthrough enhanced  and transparent  reports \ngovernance  contracting of   \nstructures and  infrastructure projects  Technical assistance (TA) \npractices, and  to the private sector  progress reports \nstrengthened public-    \nprivate interface,  Increased private  TA completion report \nbased on current  investments in   \nweakness and gaps  infrastructure  ADB review missions \nand best practices ", "  Appendix 1  7\n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nEfficiently channel  Mobilized financing for     \nprivate capital into long- infrastructure \nterm infrastructure \nprojects \n       \nOutputs/Components       \nEnabling environment  Legal, policy,  Government/sector  Reform agenda is \nfor public-private  regulatory, and  reports  pursued. \nparticipation in  institutional     \ninfrastructure  impediments for  ADB review missions  There is a potential delay \ndeveloped  involving the private  in implementing required \nsector in infrastructure  framework and strategies. \nprojects identified, and \nframeworks and sector \nstrategies developed \n \nEstablish right market  Institution of  Government/sector  Experience in dealing \nstructures and  transparent systems  reports  with the private sector is \nredefined approaches,  and processes in    limited. \ninstitutional  dealing with the private   \nreorganizations, and  sector \nappropriate policy \n  Financial instruments  Market reports  Private sector interest is \nand procedures for    limited. \nraising funds developed  Reports of financial \nintermediaries \n       \nActivities       \nAssess the current  Initial study completed  TA consultants reports  Government \nactivities of key  within 3 weeks of TA    agencies/local bodies \ninfrastructure projects  inception  Feedback from  cooperate and \n    federal/provincial  coordinate. \nIdentify and assess the  Impediments/key  governments   \nlegal, policy, regulatory,  issues identified by    Recommended action \nand institutional  end-December 2003.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n   \nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty  Sector identified as a national priority in country \nanalysis?  Yes  poverty partnership agreement? No (Agreement \n  signed on 2 September 2002) \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \nThe incidence of poverty in Pakistan increased from 26.6% in 1993 to 32.2% in 1999 and the number of the poor \nincreased by 12 million over the period. The Government has made poverty reduction the key objective of its \neconomic policies. One of the priorities under the poverty reduction strategy is good governance and creating a \nconducive environment for private sector growth. Broad-based economic growth leads to generation of productive \nemployment opportunities and increased incomes resulting in sustainable poverty reduction. This will depend much \non  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to  address  Pakistan\u2019s  structural  weakness,  particularly  in  infrastructure  sectors. \nIncreased investments in physical infrastructure, such as power, roads, and transportation, will be conducive to a \nsustainable poverty-reducing plan. Given the huge resource requirements for infrastructure development, and the \nincreasing inability of the Government to fund it from budgetary sources, increased private sector participation \nthrough long-term frameworks, policy incentives mechanisms, and public-private partnerships are necessary to \nachieve  the  desired  economic  growth.  Private  sector  funding  for  public  utilities  and  infrastructure  enables \ngovernments to direct more resources to social spending. Well-designed private sector projects function more \nefficiently, which results in lower prices, improved services, and expanded access for the poor. The project will help \nthe government develop an enabling environment for private sector participation in infrastructure development and \nthus lead to sustained economic growth and poverty reduction. Through good governance, the project will encourage \nthe growth of the private sector in infrastructure development and promote effective delivery of public services. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Improved Governance/ Economic Development \n \nThe causes of poverty (at the macro level) are attributed to failure of governance, which includes social exclusion of \nthe poor and their lack of political voice, poor fiscal management, persistent failure to address accountability and \nperformance issues with the public service, a slowdown in the pace of economic growth with the burgeoning debt \nobligations, and a decline in the public sector development programs. The economy will need to show more dynamic \nand faster growth, leading to labor absorption and an increase in the real income levels. Private sector provision for \ninfrastructure has great potential to improve the poor\u2019s access to infrastructure. The key focus areas for any poverty \nanalysis would be to identify constraints to the poor\u2019s access to basic utility services, and product and factor markets. \nInfrastructure investments complemented by policy and institutional reforms will enable markets to develop and \nfunction efficiently, thereby mainstreaming the poor. It will lead to (i) development of nonfarm incomes in rural areas; \n(ii) more efficient management and distribution of resources; (iii) reduced inflationary pressures through lower cost of \ngoods and services; (iv) freeing up of public sector funds for investments in education, health, and other antipoverty \nmeasures; and (v) substantial job creation for semiskilled and unskilled workers, particularly in rural areas. As the \nrole of the federal and provincial governments as regulator rather than direct operators of infrastructure projects \nassumes greater importance, improved regulatory and supervisory capacity and conduct of public policy, will be \ncritical to ensure that the negative impacts on the poor, job losses, increased costs from higher tariffs, etc., even in \nthe short term, of the private provision of infrastructure services are properly mitigated. \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder analysis: Yes. \nThe social assessment process will be required during infrastructure project development and will involve (i) initial \nsocial screening; (ii) scoping of social assessment; (iii) analysis of project alternatives, and minimizing social impacts; \n(iv) carrying out detailed social assessment and preparing a draft resettlement  and rehabilitation plan; and (v) \npreparing and implementing a detailed resettlement and rehabilitation action plan (RRAP) after technical design and \nbefore implementing the project. The special purpose vehicle (SPV) developing and implementing the subprojects \nwill be responsible for implementing the agreed-upon RRAPs. The TA at this point in time, will assist mainly in \nidentifying key issues and priorities to be addressed with agreed-upon action plans, and make recommendations for \ndeveloping frameworks and  sector strategies that need to be taken to improve the capacity for efficient and \ntransparent contracting of infrastructure projects to the private sector. The social assessment process will be covered \nand developed in more detail, under the TA loan proposed for 2004. \n \nParticipation strategy: It will involve (i) identifying the people affected and assets lost to the infrastructure project, (ii) \nvaluing assets, (iii) identifying vulnerable groups, (iv) formulating entitlement packages through effective public \nconsultations, (v) publicly disclosing an implementable RRAP, (vi) disbursing entitlements, and (vii) providing \ngrievance redressal. The public participation in the form of informal meetings, focus group discussions, and public \ninformation consultation meetings, as applicable and necessary, will be internalized at each stage of infrastructure \nproject development. \n \nD.
