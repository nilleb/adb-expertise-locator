THE ENSUING PROJECT  \n \n1.  Nepal\u2019s diverse agro-climatic conditions and geophysical locations provide an opportunity \nto grow a variety of tropical, sub-tropical and temperate fruit and nut species. Between 2008\u2013\n2018, the total area of fruit production has grown by 74% with production rising by 72%.1 The area \nand volume of temperate fruit tree production, which primarily occurs in the mid and high hills \nzones, have both risen by about 28% over the same period. However, while fruit and nut demand \nin Nepal is increasing because of urbanization, rising national wealth, improved knowledge of \nnutrition and increased tourist flow, domestic fruit and nut supply is not meeting demand. Between \n2013\u20132017, nut importation rose by 43% and apple importation rose by 260%. In 2017 alone, the \ncost of fruit, nut and potato importation totaled $118.5 million which is an 136% increase \ncompared to 2013 levels.2 In the case of apple and citrus, growing production and production \nareas but not meeting domestic demand is closely associated with decreasing productivity.3 \nBetween 2008/9 and 2018/19, productivity of both apple and citrus declined by 20% Nepal\u2019s fruit \nand vegetable productivity is below that of India, PRC and the world average.4 \n \n2.  The Government of Nepal requested the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) support to \nimprove livelihoods of farmers in hilly areas of five provinces through the Nuts and Fruits in Hilly \nAreas Project.5 The project will increase productivity and income of fruit and nut farmers in \nselected production clusters by enhancing (i) quality planting material production and supply \nsystems; (ii) agriculture input supply and distribution systems; and (iii) farmers\u2019 collectivism in land \nuse, climate resilient technologies adoption, production, and marketing.  \n \n3.  The following outputs are expected to be delivered under the project: (i) institutional \ncapacity for nursery and horticulture sector management improved; (ii) fruit and nut production \nand productivity of project farmers increased; and (iii) value addition to fruit and nut in hilly areas \nenhanced. The indicative cost for the project is $72 million, of which ADB is expected to finance \na concessional ordinary capital resources (COL) loan of $50 million. The government support \nthrough exemption of taxes and duties and funding towards project costs is estimated at $15 \nmillion. This transaction technical assistance (TA) is listed in the country operations business plan \n2021\u20132023.6  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n4.  The transaction TA will enhance the capacity of the executing and implementing agencies \n(IAs) to implement the ensuing project and bring in expertise that is not available locally. This \ndonor-financed agricultural project will be the first of its nature under the new three-tier federal \ngovernment system. The TA is proposed to be approved before approval of the ensuing project \nto build institutional and technical capacities of central, provincial, and local governments under \nthe new federal structure and given that the IAs are new to ADB project implementation.   \n \n1  National Center for Fruit Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development estimates. Unpublished.    \n2  Rising importation is, in part, linked to the seasonality in product supply and demand, particularly during the Dasain \nand Tihar festivals. \n3  Productivity of other key horticulture crops such as potato, tea, coffee, and flower grew modestly.  \n4  M.

Currently the government does not allow expenses for consultancy services exceeding \nfive percent of the loan project.7 Hence the TA will also support project implementation by \nengaging national farmer group facilitators (see output 4). These facilitators will support local \ngovernments that are lacking human resources to effectively reach out to approximately 40,000 \nhouseholds under the ensuing project.   \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  Output 1: Disease-free nursery management and certification system improved. The \nTA will help build the capacity of NCFD and provincial horticulture development centers to develop \nand manage disease-free sapling production and sapling quality management systems. This \nprepares NCFD and provincial horticulture centers for the implementation of the ensuing project \nthat will finance physical upgrading and infrastructure development of nurseries, training of \nnurserymen on best practices, awareness-raising of private nursery managers on quality control \nsystem,  and  national  research  on  climate  resilient  variety  development  and  horticulture \nproduction. The TA will enable the IAs to critically consider international best practices and learn \nlessons from international experience.  \n \n7.  Output 2: Agriculture input support system digitized. The TA will support the IAs to \nenhance  transparency, effectiveness  and  targeting  of their subsidy  distribution systems  by \nexploring the utilization of digital payment for financial support. While the ensuing project will \nfinance the engagement of IT companies to develop a digital payment system for the ensuing \nproject, the TA will build the capacity of the IAs to be ready to supervise the system development \nand operation by raising awareness about the best practices and available options, and by \ndeveloping  operation  and  maintenance  strategy  and  manual,  learning  from  international \nexperience.  \n \n8.  Output 3: Carbon capture of fruit and nut orchard explored. The TA will support NCFD \nand MOLMAC by engaging international experts to explore the innovative approach of carbon \nsequestration  measurement,  reporting  and  verification  of  fruit  and  nut  tree  plantation,  and \nconsider the potential of carbon financing.  \n \n9.  Output 4: Climate resilience of orchard management improved. The TA will engage \nlocal service providers that will (i) promote farmers\u2019 participation in land use planning, (ii) facilitate \nthe formation of farmer groups, (iii) strengthen the cooperatives, and (iv) support farmer-to-farmer \nextension of climate resilient farming.   \n \n10.  The TA adds value to the ensuing project by enabling the IAs to explore innovative ideas \nand approaches, such as carbon capture measurement and financing through revegetation of \nbarren land, planting fruit and nut trees, digital payment for agricultural subsidies and other \nfinancial support, nursery management, and certification system development for nut and fruit \nfarming which are new to NCFD and MOLMACs. Also, the TA will support local governments to \nmobilize hilly area farmers\u2019 action for collective land use and farmer-to-farmer extension that will \nexpedite loan disbursement and generate project outputs.     \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.0 million and will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-7). The key expenditure items are listed in Annex 1. \n \n7 Government of Nepal. Ministry of Finance. 2019. International Development Cooperation Policy. Kathmandu.  \n ", "3 \n \n12.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office, and secretarial \nassistance, and other in-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.
