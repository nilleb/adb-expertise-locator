The institutional structure for managing foreign assistance in the Kyrgyz Republic is \nevolving.  Frequent changes in the structure have had an adverse impact on the quality of \nmonitoring and management of externally assisted projects and the coordination of foreign \nassistance.  Since January 2001, the responsibility for managing external assistance lies with \nthe Ministry of Finance (MOF).  MOF's project management capacity and that of line ministries \nis  limited  resulting  in  poor  implementation  of  several  externally  assisted  projects  and  the \nconsequent erosion of project benefits. During the 2001 country programming mission of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic (the Government) \nrequested  ADB  to  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  strengthening  the  Government's \ncapacity for project monitoring and aid coordination. The TA was included in the 2002 program. \nIn September 2002, the Fact-Finding Mission from ADB held detailed discussions with officials \nof MOF and key line ministries and the representative offices of the principal external funding \nagencies. The Government informed the Mission that the TA should concentrate on improving \nproject management and monitoring capacity in MOF and line ministries in view of the urgent \nneed  to  improve  implementation  of  externally  assisted  projects.    Further,  it  requested  the \nMission not to focus on aid coordination as other agencies had expressed interest in supporting \nthis activity.  Accordingly, the TA was modified to reflect this new orientation.  Understandings \nwere reached with MOF on the objectives and the scope of the proposed TA, and its terms of \nreference,  implementation  arrangements,  and  cost  estimates.1    The  TA  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The present institutional structures, systems, and procedures for project monitoring and \nmanagement are fundamentally weak.  They do not lend themselves easily to an efficient \ncentral oversight of the process.  This has resulted in weak project implementation and delays in \nseveral externally funded projects and a general deterioration of the country\u2019s portfolio of such \nprojects.2  Measures need to be instituted to address the problem so that project implementation \ncan  be  monitored  closely  and  timely  corrective  action  taken  where  necessary.  This  is \nparticularly required in this regime of scarce budget resources which is expected to continue in \nthe medium term.  These, and the limits on the public investment program instituted under the \npoverty reduction and growth facility of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) make it critical \nthat the Government improves project implementation and can accurately assess the stage of \nimplementation of the ongoing projects.  The instituting of an efficient project management and \nmonitoring system will also enable the Government to take well-based decisions to ensure that \nscarce resources are directed to better performing projects.  \n \n3.  The Government will have to improve the quality of implementing externally assisted \nprojects  to  enhance  their  effectiveness  as  the  size  of  external  assistance  will  shrink \nprogressively during the next 3 years.  The Kyrgyz Republic has decided to compress external \nfunding of the public investment program sharply as part of its strategy to reduce the debt \nburden.  Further, it has also decided to strive to obtain assistance increasingly in the form of \ngrants.    This  policy  will  progressively  reduce  the  disbursements  from  about  6%  of  gross \ndomestic product currently to about 3% by 2005.  The Government, however, can minimize any \npossible adverse impact on growth and poverty reduction of reduced public investment if it \n                                                 \n1 The TA was listed in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 7 October 2002. \n2 This was identified clearly in the findings of TA 3382 KGZ: Strengthening the Capacity of MOF for Financial \nManagement and Planning of the PIP, which was completed in July 2001.  \n ", "2    \nimproves implementation of externally funded projects, and targets the assistance increasingly \nto poor regions and groups.   \n \n4.  Project management and implementation is decentralized, yet the line ministries have \nnot developed effective management procedures and implementation systems to keep track of \nthe physical progress of projects and ascertain, analyze, and report, in a timely manner, the \nreasons for delays in their implementation. Weaknesses in institutional arrangements within \nvarious  ministries  and  limited  project  management  capabilities  in  the  line  ministries  and  in \nproject  implementation  units  compound  the  systemic  problems.  Quite  often,  the  lack  of \nunderstanding in PIUs and the line ministries of project implementation requirements result in \nimplementation delays.  The procedures that govern the relationship between MOF and line \nministries also need to be streamlined to improve coordination and reduce implementation \ndelays. These problems need to be addressed by assessing the efficacy of project management \nprocedures and streamlining them.  In addition, the capacity of line ministries needs to be \nenhanced through training in project management and monitoring and in the effective use of \nPIUs for project implementation. \n \n5.  The  present  system  of  quarterly  reporting  on  project  implementation  by  the  line \nministries to MOF is not satisfactory and does not meet the requirements of effective monitoring.  \nThe system is manual, and in practice, the reports are not standardized nor do they have \nenough depth to enable appropriate responses by decision makers.  In particular, the exchange \nof information between MOF and line ministries in its present form is not amenable to effective \naid  prioritization  and  cash  flow  planning  in  MOF  and  project  activity  planning  in  the  line \nministries.    Resources  have  to  be  made  available  in  a  timely  manner  for  the  effective \nimplementation of projects.  To achieve this, MOF needs to know the financial requirements of \nall externally assisted projects and their temporal flow to enable proper cash planning.  This is \nparticularly  important  in  a  country  with  highly  seasonal  construction  activities  due  to  the \nweather.  Similarly, the line ministries need to know the timing of MOF's fund releases to plan \ntheir activities effectively.  MOF also needs updated information periodically on progress in \nproject  implementation  to  provide  resources  effectively  to  the  line  ministries.    The  present \nsystem does not meet these needs.  \n \n6.  An  integrated  monitoring  of  external  assistance  encompassing  the  individual \nrequirements of MOF, the line ministries, and other stakeholders is an important prerequisite for \neffective implementation of externally assisted projects.  Though MOF and line ministries have \ndatabases, they have not been integrated into a coherent management information system \n(MIS) useful for decision making.  MOF\u2019s present database on external assistance has inherent \nlimitations as tool for project monitoring. Most of the line ministries have their own project \nmonitoring systems established by the project implementation units (PIUs) separately for each \nproject, which are often not standardized.  As a result, the line ministries do not have an \nadequate overview of the performance of the projects under their control. The information flows \nbetween MOF and the line ministries are inadequate for effective and timely decision-making. \nThe information generated is not presented adequately to meet the specific decision-making \nrequirements  of  different  stakeholders.  There  is  no  system  to  make  relevant  information \navailable periodically and on demand to key decision makers.  This results in information not \nbeing used effectively for making decisions. \n \n7.  The  database  on  foreign  assistance  is  not  comprehensive  nor  does  it  provide \ninformation in a manner that helps the Government to target such assistance to the poorer \nregions  and  groups.    Certain  relatively  better-off  provinces  and  districts  are  receiving  a \ndisproportionately large share of foreign assistance.  This is happening, in part, due to improper ", "      3 \npresentation  of  information  regarding  sectors  and  the  spatial  profile  of  foreign  assistance. \nPresentation of imbalances in the distribution of external assistance transparently is expected to \ngenerate awareness to target assistance to poorer regions and groups. Though the necessary \ninformation may be available, it is scattered across agencies and is not compiled in a central \nplace in a systematic manner.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The  TA  will  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  external  assistance  by  improving  project \nmonitoring and management. This will be achieved by (i) improving the institutional structures \nand project management procedures; (ii) developing improved monitoring procedures and an \nintegrated project monitoring and management information system for MOF, line ministries, and \nother  stakeholders;  and  (iii)  human  resource  development  through  training  of  appropriate \noperations and managerial staff in items (i) and (ii).  The TA will also help improve the targeting \nof assistance to poorer regions and groups. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  To accomplish the objective, the TA will support five interrelated activities: \n \n(i)  The  TA  will  improve  the  institutional  structures,  project  implementation \nprocedures,  and  reporting  arrangements  for  effectively  managing  external \nassistance  after  making  a  functional  analysis  of  departments  of  MOF,  line \nministries and other stakeholders. \n(ii)  Based  on  the  functional  analysis  of  agencies,  departments,  and  divisions  of \nMOF, the TA will (a) determine the information requirements of these agencies \nand  their  departments  and  divisions  and  design  a  comprehensive  MIS  for \nmonitoring and managing external assistance, and improving the execution of \nexternally assisted projects to maximize  their impact on poverty alleviation and \ngrowth;  and  (b)  design  the  MIS  in  a  modular  fashion  to  meet  the  individual \nrequirements  of  stakeholders  and  include  distinct  components  to  monitor  \nplanned and proposed projects; proposals in processing stage; loans and grants \nbeing  implemented;  progress  of  bids,  contract  awards,  and  procurement; \nprogress of project implementation; budget formulation; and disbursements.  \n(iii)  The  TA  will  organize  workshops  to  discuss  and  ascertain  the  views  of \nstakeholders, including external agencies, on the proposed improvements to the \nprocedures  and  institutional  structure,  and  to  determine  their  information \nrequirements for project management and monitoring. \n(iv)  The TA will (a) analyze the databases in MOF and other line ministries; (b) \ndevelop and implement a computer program that uses, to the extent possible, the \nexisting databases, collection processes, and their software effectively to support \nan  integrated  MIS  to  meet  the  requirements  of  individual  agencies;  (c) \nrecommend  hardware  requirements  and  cost  effective  means  of  data \ncommunication using the existing infrastructure to the extent possible; and (d) \nmake  the  MIS  operational  and  train  staff  and  senior  managers  to  use  the \ndatabase. \n ", "4    \n(v)  The TA will provide training to MOF and line ministries in project monitoring and \nmanagement and the use of computerized MIS for taking decisions.  A local \ninstitution  will  help  develop  training  materials  and  impart  training.  This  will \ndevelop local skills and will make the process sustainable and cost effective. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $683,900 equivalent, of which $404,500 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $279,400 equivalent is the local currency cost.  The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $176,400 equivalent of local \ncurrency cost.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program.  The \nGovernment will finance the remaining local currency costs of $103,000 equivalent though \nprovision  of  office  space,  staff  support,  and  other  items.    Detailed  cost  estimates  are  in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The Department of Investment Policy in MOF will be the Executing Agency for the TA.  \nMOF\u2019s new organization structure after its reorganization in August 2002 is in Appendix 3.  The \nTA will be implemented by MOF in close consultation with the line ministries. The TA will be \nimplemented over a period of 14 months with 14 person-months of service to be provided by \ntwo international consultants (8 person-months by an international project management and \nimplementation adviser (team leader), and 6 by a computer specialist with strong background in \nsystems analysis and programming).  The international consultants will be supported by 35 \nperson-months of service by six domestic consultants in the fields of project management, \ncomputer programming, and training.  Outline terms of reference are given in Appendix 4.  The \nteam leader will provide inputs in two phases.  In the first phase of 6 months the team leader will \ncomplete  the  institutional  analysis;  assess  the  reasons  for  project  implementation  delays; \nsuggest  procedural  improvements  for  management  and  monitoring;  and  determine  the \nrequirements  for  the  MIS  of  MOF,  the  line  ministries,  and  other  stakeholders  by  holding \nworkshops  for  the  purpose.  In  the  second  phase,  the  team  leader  will  oversee  the \nimplementation of MIS by the computer specialists, develop a course material for the project \nmanagement training program, and initiate the training program. The training will be continued \nby local consultants subsequently over a period of 2 months. Both the international consultants \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and other \narrangements  acceptable  to  the  ADB  will  be  followed  for  the  selection  of  the  domestic \nconsultants.    All  equipment  and  materials  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  procedures \nsatisfactory to ADB.  The TA is expected to commence in March 2003 and conclude in May \n2004. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n12.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $580,900 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Kyrgyz Republic for Strengthening the Capacity to Manage and Monitor \nExternally Assisted Projects, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
