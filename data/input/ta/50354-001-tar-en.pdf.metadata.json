INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested support to \nrespond to the needs of vulnerable children through support from social workers in the delivery of \nservices to vulnerable children. The proposed knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) \nwill support the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MOCA) to develop policy recommendations which will \nstrengthen social work services for vulnerable children through (i) research on international \nexperience, (ii) development of guidelines for service standards, and (iii) training requirements for \nsocial workers.1 This will help improve the social protection system for vulnerable children and \nensure that their needs are better met.  \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy \nfor the PRC, 2016\u20132020,2 the Social Protection Operational Plan, 2014\u20132020,3 and is included in \nthe PRC country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019.4 The TA is also aligned with the PRC \nThirteenth Five-Year Plan which states that there will be sustained commitment to \u201cprovide care, \npsychological counseling, and other services for children in need\u201d in addition to \u201cproviding special \ncare for left-behind children in rural areas.\u201d5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The PRC has been experiencing rapid demographic and social change as a result of \neconomic growth since the 1980s. The shift from a centrally planned to a market-based economy \nin 1978 led to rapid economic and social development, with an average gross domestic product \ngrowth of nearly 10% since 1978, and nearly 800 million people being pulled out of poverty.6 This \nrapid growth has, however, brought with it a set of challenges and new vulnerabilities, especially \nfor children, including increased inequality, pockets of persistent poverty, and changing family \nstructures driven in part by rapid urbanization, internal migration, and industrialization. One such \nvulnerability  due  to  regionally  unbalanced  economic  growth,  specific  to  the  PRC,  is  a \nconsequence of rural\u2013urban migration and the hukou system,7 where children are left behind in \nrural areas by parents in search of better employment opportunities. Despite significant reductions \nin the number of children left-behind over the past few years, this is still a substantial issue.8 This \nremains one vulnerability facing children, though many others exist including unequal opportunity, \npoverty, and inequality. \n \n4.  Unbalanced economic growth has created a group of children who are vulnerable because \nof poverty, disability, special needs, or failing parental care. In the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, the \nPRC has outlined plans to promote better care and protection for vulnerable children \u201cliving in \ndifficulties.\u201d This is defined as children left behind by parents, those living in poverty, those living \nwith disability, orphans, and children without parental care. Most recently, in 2016, PRC State \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 3 July 2017. \n2  ADB. 2016.

China Overview. http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview  \n7  Established in the 1950s, the hukou system ties people to their place of residence by making government services \nonly available in an individual\u2019s location of origin. Individuals who would like to move permanently to another location \noutside of their rural area, city, town, or township boundaries require approval for hukou change from local authorities. \n8  Current estimates are approximately 9.2 million left behind children nationwide.

The purpose of this TA is to help MOCA develop the necessary policies \nand social work system which will be able to support vulnerable children across all of the \ncategories adduced above, to ensure their well-being and opportunities in society.  \n \n5.  Lessons. ADB has been involved in assisting the PRC and MOCA in developing their \nsocial protection programs through several TA projects, including Strategies for Involving Social \nWorkers in Social Assistance10 and Social Work Services Policy and Delivery Modes for the \nElderly with Special Difficulties.11 Both these projects (i) reflect the ongoing collaborative effort to \ndevelop  the  area  of  social  work  as  a  necessary  support  for  vulnerable  groups  and  as  a \nprofessional occupation well embedded in the social protection system; and (ii) provide valuable \nlessons on (a) the importance of assessing social work services for different vulnerable groups, \n(b) properly planning for the development of social work services, and (c) developing standards \nand  trainings  for  social  workers.  The  area  of  social  work  for  vulnerable  children  is  still \nunderdeveloped and in need of rapid improvement.  \n \n6.  MOCA seeks to expand the role of social workers in providing social assistance to \nvulnerable children. To accomplish this, systems are necessary to better define the needed \nservices, link social workers to vulnerable children, and train social workers appropriately on how \nto deal with special issues arising for vulnerable child populations. Several key issues require \nattention to promote engagement of social workers in reaching and assisting vulnerable children. \nFirst, a strong policy framework and recommendations for strategies to strengthen social work \nservices for vulnerable children are needed. Second, guidelines for service models of engaging \nsocial workers to assist vulnerable children need to be developed. Third, guidelines on training \nrequirements for social workers to manage and work with vulnerable children are needed. And \nfourth, an assessment report for an information technology system to coordinate and manage \nsocial work services has to be crafted. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: policy environment for social work services \nfor vulnerable children strengthened (PRC State Council Order No. 36: Opinions on Strengthening \nthe Guarantee for Destitute Children) (footnote 9). The TA will have the following outcome: social \nwork system for vulnerable children strengthened.  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n \n8.  Output 1: Policy recommendations and operational guidelines on strengthening \nsocial work services for vulnerable children developed. The TA will review international and \n                                                \n9  Government of the PRC, State Council.  \n    http://english.gov.cn/archive/state_council_gazette/2016/12/30/content_281475528704218.htm  (accessed  on           \n5 June 2017). \n10 ADB. 2016.

The study report should focus on policies, \nfinancing options and scope of service delivery, quality, and safety monitoring with a specific \nsection on gender analysis. The study report should also seek to understand, discuss, and \nanalyze how the PRC\u2019s economic transformation has affected current policies for vulnerable \nchildren, in addition to considering existing estimates of the number of vulnerable children within \nthe country and, if possible, trends in the data across years. The study report will be disseminated \nto policy makers and practitioners from MOCA departments. The TA will study the needs of \nvulnerable children in the PRC with gender-specific issues highlighted, and identify and prepare \nguidelines and an implementation framework for social work services and their delivery. The TA \nwill facilitate an international study tour in identified countries where there has been best practice \nin designing social work services for vulnerable children. Relevant officials of the ministry and \nbureaus of civil affairs will be consulted on the countries of greatest relevance for the PRC, where \nthere can be some learnings gleaned. In addition, the TA will develop guidelines on training needs \nfor social workers who will work with vulnerable children. The guidelines will provide a framework \non training needs in areas where social workers should be trained to support vulnerable children.  \n \n9.  Output  2:  Assessment  report  of  potential  information  technology  system  and \ndatabase  prepared.  The  TA  will  conduct  a  needs  assessment  for  a  secure  information \ntechnology database and management system to be set up to coordinate, assess, and manage \nservices, and monitor social workers and link them to vulnerable children across rural and urban \nareas with guidance on methods for collecting sex-disaggregated data. The database will be a \ndecision support system which is gender responsive. The assessment report will determine the \nfinancing and other sustainability requirements of a potential database system and all other issues \nto set it up.  \n \n10.  Output 3: Awareness of social work services for vulnerable children enhanced. Two \nworkshops and a final conference, with participation from central and provincial government \nofficials, other international partners, and civil society stakeholders, will be held to discuss and \ndisseminate TA findings and policy recommendations. A knowledge product on social work \nservices for vulnerable children will be prepared and a final TA report will be submitted to MOCA \nand ADB.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n12.
