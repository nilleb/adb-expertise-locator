INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In July 2014, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) became a member of the Open \nGovernment Partnership (OGP) to help strengthen the governance principles of openness, \ntransparency, accountability, and participation in Asia and the Pacific. This proposal responds to \na direct invitation from the OGP Steering Committee1 and from three OGP member countries for \nADB to support government and civil society actors to advance open government across the \nregion. This capacity development technical assistance (TA) seeks to support OGP member \ncountries to formulate and implement commitments made in the OGP national action plans \n(NAPs).2 The TA will also provide learning opportunities for aspiring member countries to meet \nOGP eligibility status in the areas of access to information, budget transparency, income and \nasset disclosure, and citizen engagement. The project design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The recently launched Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) highlight the need for \npublic access to information as a building block for promoting peaceful and inclusive societies \nfor development. The SDG Goal number 16 aims to \u201cpromote peaceful and inclusive societies \nfor sustainable development, provide access to justice for all, and build effective, accountable, \nand inclusive institutions at all levels\u201d. It further defines at least three targets that this project will \nsignificantly  contribute  to.  These  are  Targets  16.6  (develop  effective,  accountable  and \ntransparent  institutions  at  all  levels),  16.7  (Ensure  responsive,  inclusive,  participatory  and \nrepresentative decision-making at all levels), and 16.10 (Ensure public access to information \nand protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international \nagreements). These targets underscore the importance of information platforms that would \nmake governments more effective, transparent, and accountable, as well as ensure that citizens \nparticipate in governance processes.  \n \n3.  The Open Government Partnership was formally launched in September 2011, when its \neight founding governments (Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, Norway, the Philippines, South Africa, \nthe United Kingdom, and the United States) endorsed the Open Government Declaration, and \nannounced their country action plans. The OGP is a \u201cmultilateral initiative that aims to secure \nconcrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight \ncorruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance.\u201d4 It is a voluntary initiative \nthat aims at building trust and fostering collaboration between governments and their citizens to \nimprove development outcomes. In order to join OGP, an aspiring member country must first \nsatisfy  the  \u201celigibility  criteria.\u201d  This  means  that  a  minimum  level  of  commitment  to  open \ngovernment principles, in the following four areas has to be met: (i) budget transparency; (ii) \naccess to information; (iii) income and asset disclosure; and (iv) citizen engagement. Once \neligibility has been confirmed, the interested government needs to identify a lead ministry and/or \nagency that will start formulating the NAP in close consultation with civil society and citizen \n                                                \n1  The OGP is overseen at the international level by a steering committee composed of representatives of member \ncountry governments and civil society organizations that together guide the ongoing development and direction of \nthe OGP. http://www.opengovpartnership.org/ogp-steering-committee#sthash.ifcNaZHV.dpuf  \n2  Categorized as knowledge and support technical assistance under the new staff instructions effective 13 March \n2017.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 June 2016. \n4  Open Government Partnership. http://www.opengovpartnership.org/about  \n ", "2    \n \ngroups. The NAPs contain the members\u2019 respective reform commitments over a 2-year period.5  \nThe ultimate goal is to improve the quality of governance, as well as the quality of projects and \nservices that citizens receive. The OGP aspires to support both government and civil society \nreformers by elevating open government to the highest levels of political discourse, providing \ncover for difficult reforms, and creating a supportive community of like-minded reformers from \ncountries around the world.  \n \n4.  In  2014,  ADB  became  a  multilateral  partner  of  the  OGP  to  support  its  developing \nmember  countries  (DMCs),  which  have  become  OGP  members,  implement  their  open \ngovernment  action  plans.  The  ADB  also  supports  aspiring  member  countries  to  meet  the \neligibility criteria for joining the OGP.6 ADB\u2019s partnership with the OGP is based on the long-\nterm  commitment  to  supporting  multi-stakeholder  governance  initiatives.  ADB\u2019s  recent \nGovernance  Thematic  Group  (GovTG)  position  paper  on  better  performing  institutions \nrecognizes the importance of institutional performance and results. At the outcome level, the \naim  is  to  facilitate  performing,  responsive  and  resilient  institutions  that  deliver  better \ndevelopment results to citizens. Immediate outputs include better governance and accountability \nmechanisms, systems and business processes, new and enhanced skills and management \npractices as well as greater attention to and support of multi-stakeholder coalitions that can \ndrive  reform  and  change.7 ADB\u2019s  partnership  with  the  OGP  is  highly  consistent  with  the \napproach described in the position paper, because of the OGP\u2019s focus on facilitating better \ninstitutions that deliver better development results, as well as its emphasis on multi-stakeholder \nparticipation and collaboration between governments and citizens.   \n \n5.  Eight  OGP  member  countries  among  ADB\u2019s  DMCs  (Armenia,  Georgia,  Indonesia, \nMongolia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and Sri Lanka) have made a commitment to \nwork toward improving the participation of citizens and civil society in the formulation and \nimplementation of their NAPs, and have requested for ADB support in this process. The DMCs \nare at different stages of implementation with Armenia, Georgia, Indonesia, Mongolia and the \nPhilippines  showing  impressive  initial  results  in  selected  OGP  areas,  notably  Indonesia\u2019s \n\u201cResponsive Open Data Model. However, often the reforms are introduced on a pilot basis \nnotwithstanding the important need to roll out reforms across the country and to institutionalize \nsuccessful pilots. The next step will require extensive training of key government agencies, \ncitizens and civil society organizations (CSOs), and improve business processes. Successful \nreform  programs  vary from  country  to  country.  Hence,  there  is  a great  potential for  OGP \ncountries to share knowledge and experience on successful reforms in the region. It is also \nrecognized that better understanding and relationship of trust need to be established among key \nstakeholder  groups,  especially  in  countries  which  historically,  had  not  been  able  to \ninstitutionalize meaningful citizen participation in decision-making.   \n \n6.  Past ADB support to strengthen civil society participation in OGP includes the regional \nTA on Governance and Capacity Development Initiative (Phase 2). It has supported workshops \nfor both government and civil society OGP focal persons from DMCs to take stock of their joint \n                                                \n5  H. Lindroth. 2016.

Twelve of \nADB\u2019s  nonregional  members  also  participate  in  the  OGP\u2014Canada,  Denmark,  Finland,  Ireland,  Italy,  the \nNetherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Several more ADB \nmember countries have shown an interest in joining the OGP in the near future.    \n7  ADB. 2016. Better Performing Institutions in ADB Developing Member Countries.

ADB  also  facilitated  three  regional  events,8 to  share  knowledge  and \ninnovative ways by which governments engage with their citizens and CSOs, targeting both \nOGP member countries, as well as those who aspire to join. As a result of such knowledge \nsharing and networking events, several OGP countries have been encouraged to replicate \nsuccessful approaches of specific governance reforms areas that that have worked in other \nOGP member countries. As an example, providing greater data transparency has generated \nstrong interest from several countries that would like to make better use of the digital revolution.  \nCountries such as the Philippines have been reviewing options for introducing Freedom of \nInformation legislation that have successfully been institutionalized in other countries, such as \nIndia. In addition, hosting successful events for DMC officials, CSOs and other development \npartners has increasingly recognized ADB as a knowledge organization which can contribute \nimmensely to improving governance at the country level. ADB\u2019s regional departments have \nrecognized that there was government demand for transparent and accountable institutions in \nsome countries and increasingly saw potential to include such OGP initiatives in their lending \nportfolios.    \n  \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The  impact  will  be  increased  collaboration  between  governments  and  civil  society \norganizations in Asia and the Pacific to enhance accountability and transparency in public \nservice delivery. The outcome will be a strengthened collaboration between the government and \ncivil society to support citizen participation in service delivery. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The TA will contribute to the formulation and implementation of specific actions included \nin the OGP NAPs and will support broader OGP knowledge generation and sharing through \nthree outputs.9 The participating countries (Armenia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea) were \nselected based on their demand for ADB assistance to help them formulate and implement their \nNAPs. Another important criterion was the strong link of the proposed TA with ongoing or \nplanned lending operations and the related demand from regional departments for inclusion in \nthe TA. This resulted in the inclusion of Armenia and Indonesia in the TA. Papua New Guinea \nrecently joined the OGP and will be finalizing and rolling out their NAP implementation.  \n \n9.  Output 1: Knowledge products on open government partnership developed and \ndisseminated.  Output  1  will  prepare  a  training  needs  assessment  report  which  identifies \nknowledge and skills required of government agencies and CSOs in the three OGP countries, to \nbe able to carry out reforms and promote transparency, better access to information, and \nimproved citizen engagement, among others. Consultation meetings with key government and \ncivil  society  representatives  will  be  organized  to  recommend  ways  to  strengthen  citizen \nengagement in governance, expand information sharing, and improve service delivery. Based \non  recommendations,  a  program  for  building  the  capacity  of  government  and  civil  society \nrepresentatives for more transparent and accountable governance will be developed. \n \n10.  Output 2: Capacity of stakeholders in selected DMCs to promote and implement \nthe NAP strengthened. Output 2 will conduct training programs and cross-learning events from \n                                                \n8  Knowledge events were held on September 2015, November 2015, and July 2016. \n9  This TA will only provide support to OGP member countries, which are also ADB\u2019s developing member countries. \n ", "4    \n \nAsia-Pacific  OGP  members  and  AMCs  on  subjects  related  to  the  following:  (i) information \nsharing; (ii) open data, including data collection and data analysis; (iii) use of information and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT)  for  improved  governance;  (iv)  implementing  the  right  to \ninformation; and (v) citizens\u2019 engagement in the Asia-Pacific OGP. The training and learning will \nbe identified from output 1 in the areas listed from (i) to (v).  \n \n11.  Output 3: Community-based initiative on monitoring government service delivery \npilot tested. Output 3 will provide of technical and demonstration support for carrying out the \nimplementation of action plans through subproject training to communities by the OGP and civil \nsociety on NAPs. The projects were selected based on demand from the OGP government focal \npoints. The output comprises innovative initiatives to use technology for data sharing, data \nanalysis,  information  sharing  monitoring,  as  well  as  to  strengthen  citizen  engagement  to \nimprove service delivery in two countries requested by their governments. Output 3 has two \nsubprojects:   \n \n(i)  Subproject 3.1. Improved service delivery processes and open data procedures are \ndisseminated  and  rolled  out  in  two  additional  subnational  governments.  At  the \nrequest  of  the  OGP  focal  point  in  Indonesia,  the  TA  will  support  innovative \napproaches to improve service delivery processes and open data procedures at the \nsubnational level in Indonesia. The subproject will build on earlier work conducted in \nBanda Aceh under the Kinerja project financed by the United States Agency for \nInternational Development. Kinerja introduced demand- and supply-side approaches \nto use open data for public service delivery improvements. The Kinerja activities in \nBanda Aceh ended in September 2015. ADB is deepening the Kinerja activities in \nBanda  Aceh  under  a  component  of  the  regional  capacity  development  TA  on \nDelivering  Knowledge  Solutions  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific10   to  strengthen  citizen \nengagement and data quality. Implementation has started in October 2016 and will \nend in April 2017. Subproject 3.1 will utilize the Banda Aceh good practice developed \nunder the Kinerja project and the regional capacity development TA on Knowledge \nSolutions in Asia and the Pacific to disseminate information at the national level, in \nclose  cooperation  with  the  OGP  focal  point.  An  additional  two  subnational \ngovernments will be selected and supported for strengthening their demand- and \nsupply-side approaches to use open data for public service delivery improvements in \nselected sectors. The results will be scaled up through a policy-based loan on Public \nFinancial Management for Service Delivery in the 2018 indicative lending pipeline for \nIndonesia.11  \n \n(ii) Subproject 3.2. The subproject aims to support Armenia to reduce potential integrity \nand safeguards risks under the Seismic Safety Improvement Program (SSIP), an \nADB project approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors on 22 September 2015.12 The \nsubproject is to test a community-based integrity initiative pilot project, which will help \nthe  government  to  monitor  the  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  of  schools  with \nadequate seismic safety in Armenia under the SSIP. By using training community \nmonitors to observe and monitor school reconstruction under the SSIP, the pilot \nproject will contribute to schools with better structural integrity and seismic safety by \n(i) reducing the risks of resource leakage in the construction process, (ii) ensuring \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2015.

The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will be the executing agency of the TA project, which will be implemented from \nFebruary 2017 to February 2019. The Thematic Advisory Service Cluster of the Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department will be responsible for administering the TA \nactivities. Subproject 3.1 will be administered by the GovTG Secretariat of ADB and subproject \n3.2 will be administered by the NGO and Civil Society Center. The TA will coordinate with the \nOGP secretariat and the OECD\u2019s Open Government Network to call on these two institution\u2019s \nexperts for the purpose of information sharing and cross learning at training events. The two \nsubprojects under output 3 will be jointly implemented with relevant regional departments and \nthe country OGP focal points.  \n \n14.   The TA will finance consulting services, reports, and other knowledge products, as well \nas workshops and other knowledge and learning events. The TA will provide international \nconsultants (18 person-months) and national consultants (66 person-months). The expertise \nincludes access to information, budget transparency, income and asset disclosure, and citizen \nengagement. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The terms of reference for \nconsultants  will  be  further  developed  when  specific  activities  are  undertaken.  Given  the \nintermittence of the assignments and the variety of skills required, consultants will be recruited \nindividually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time) and with output-based contracts and lump sum out of pocket expenses \nwherever possible.  \n \n15.  Output 3.2 will utilize letters of agreement and recruitment of consultants to work with \nCSOs to carry out the training activities, using the milestone achievements under the identified \nwork plan as references for output-based performance contracts and lump-sum out-of-pocket \nexpenses, wherever possible. Integrity Action, the partner organization will provide national and \ninternational consultants to conduct activities listed in the design and monitoring framework.    \n   \n16.  All  disbursements  under  the TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). In the event that \nADB staff act as resource persons in the implementation of the TA, travel and related costs will \nbe charged to the TA. However, their salaries and benefits will be charged to ADB\u2019s internal \nadministrative expenses budget.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nAsian Development Bank administering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of \n$1,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for \nStrengthening Government and Civil Society Cooperation in Open Government Partnership to \nImprove Public Services, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nCollaboration between governments and civil society organizations in Asia and the Pacific to enhance \naccountability and transparency in public service delivery increased.a \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2019:      \nGovernment and civil  a.  6 DMC OGP countries  a\u2013b.
