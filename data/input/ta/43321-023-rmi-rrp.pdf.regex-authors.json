I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan to the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) for subprogram 2 of the Public \nSector Program.1 \n \n2.  The  program,  supported  by  a  policy-based  loan,  will  improve  the  long-term  fiscal \nsustainability of the Government of the Marshall Islands. In 2010, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) approved (i) a program cluster for the public sector program and (ii) financing from the \nAsian Development Fund (ADF) of $9.5 million (SDR6,413,000) for subprogram 1 of the public \nsector program.2 The public sector program supports the implementation of the government\u2019s \nreform initiatives and initiates the adjustments required to achieve long-term fiscal sustainability. \nUnder subprogram 1, policy actions were designed and the implementation of immediate reform \npriorities began. Subprogram 2 will complete the implementation of the policy actions. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The RMI consists of 29 low-lying atolls and five single islands that cover 181 square \nkilometers of land area spread across nearly 5 million square kilometers of the western Pacific \nOcean. The country gained independence in 1979, having been administered by the United \nStates (US) as part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands since 1947. The 2011 census \nrecorded a total population of 53,158 persons, with approximately 74% of the population living \non Majuro and Ebeye.3 ADB has identified the RMI as a fragile situation since 2008; among the \nconstraints that underlie weak performance and fragility are weak public sector institutions, \nlimited government capacity, and underdeveloped governance systems.4 \n \n4.  The RMI economy relies heavily on government expenditure and, in turn, on foreign \ngrants, which fund more than two-thirds of government expenditure. Most foreign grants are \nprovided  by  the  US, mainly  under  the  amended  Compact  of  Free  Association.5 Increased \nforeign grants helped the economy grow at an average annual rate of 3.1% in FY2000\u2013FY2007. \nHowever, the economy contracted by 1.9% in FY2008 and 1.3% in FY2009, as high world food \nand  fuel  prices  raised  inflation  to  14.7%,  prompting  the  declaration  of  a  state  of  national \neconomic emergency. The economy grew by 5.2% in FY2010, driven by an expansion of fishery \noutput and exports, and moderating fuel prices. Similarly, growth in FY2011 was 5.0%, driven \nby bigger fish catches, large inflows from the Kwajalein land use agreement, and the Federal \nAviation Administration-funded airport extension project (Table 1). \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2010.

Growth over the medium term in the RMI is expected to stay low at around 1.5%,6 and \nrevenues are projected to decline (Table 2). Within this low-growth scenario, the RMI needs to \nadjust  to  the  annual  decline  in  US  Compact  grants,  which  will  expire  in  FY2023.  Of  a \n$130 million annual budget in FY2011, about $95 million was funded by bilateral donors, with \napproximately two-thirds of this representing Compact grants. The RMI and US governments \nare investing in a Compact trust fund that is intended to generate a revenue stream to replace \nCompact  grants  from  FY2024.  Contributions  from  the  RMI  government  have  fallen  short, \nhowever, because excessive recurrent expenditure and poor revenue performance prevented \nthe generation of the required fiscal surpluses. Under current policies, there will be insufficient \ngovernment assets in the Compact trust fund in 2023 to replace the expiring Compact grants.7 \n \nTable 2: Economic Outlook, FY2012\u2013FY2015 \nItem  FY2012   FY2013   FY2014   FY2015  \nReal GDP (% change)  5.4   2.6   0.6  1.4 \nInflation (%)  2.5   3.0   1.7  1.9 \nRevenue (% of GDP)  62.9   60.9   59.1  58.5 \nPersonnel costs (% of revenue)  30.5   \u2026  \u2026  \u2026 \nFiscal balance (% of GDP)  1.0   0.5   0.7  0.8 \nExternal debt (% of GDP)  54.8   57.0  52.9  48.8 \nNominal GDP ($ million)  184.3   \u2026  \u2026  \u2026 \n\u2026 = not available, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: ADB.

Fiscal  and  structural  reforms  are  therefore  urgently  needed  to  achieve  fiscal \nsustainability and generate sustainable medium-term economic growth. Structural reforms will \nstimulate private sector economic activity, generate domestic employment and incomes, and \nbroaden the local tax base, while tax reforms will boost domestic revenue collection and offset \nthe imminent reduction in grants. Implementing state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms and \nreducing public expenditures will contribute to improving the fiscal balance. \n \n                                                \n6  International Monetary Fund. 2011. Republic of the Marshall Islands. 2011 Article IV Consultation. Washington, DC. \n7  The International Monetary Fund baseline scenario assumes that the government maintains a modest fiscal \nsurplus of about 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) over the medium term, and GDP growth gradually declines \nto about 1.5% over the medium term. Under this scenario there would be a gap of $15.4 million to fully replace \nexpired Compact grants from FY2024. \n ", "3 \n7.  In 2009, recognizing the need for reform, the RMI government began several initiatives \nto advance public sector reform and promote macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth. \nThese included the preparation of a comprehensive recovery plan for the Marshalls Energy \nCompany (MEC) and the formation of the Comprehensive Adjustment Program (CAP) Advisory \nGroup and the Tax and Revenue Reform and Modernization (TRAM) Commission to prepare \nfiscal reform plans.8 These initiatives formed the basis of the government\u2019s strategy to mitigate \nthe impact of the global financial crisis and subsequently led to the design of ADB\u2019s support for \nthe public sector program (footnote 2). \n \n8.  Subprogram 1 supported the design and initial implementation of reforms to rectify the \nsituation  in  which  the  government  found  itself  in  2008  and  2009.  The  subprogram  was \nimplemented successfully by the government and had a positive outcome by putting in place a \nsolid foundation on which to begin the implementation of further reforms under subprogram 2. \nBeginning in 2009, and continuing throughout the implementation of the program, the policy \nconditions of subprogram 1 have stabilized the fiscal situation, particularly in the areas of debt \nand expenditure management. \n \n9.  Under subprogram 1, the government onlent the majority of loan funds to MEC.9 The \nfunds were used to repay a high-interest loan held by MEC with a commercial bank. Using the \ncash-flow savings from repaying this loan, MEC was able to refurbish a generator and achieve a \nsignificantly higher megawatt output, which reduced fuel usage by about 14%. \n \n10.  Subprogram 1 included several covenants concerning the rationalization of MEC, of \nwhich the onlending arrangement between the government and MEC was critical in contributing \nto MEC\u2019s long-term commercial and financial stability.10 Under subprogram 1, the government \nwas required to (i) ensure that a subsidiary loan agreement was executed between the Ministry \nof Finance (MOF) and MEC, (ii) establish a sinking fund account at a commercial bank to \naccumulate funds to service its repayment obligations under the loan agreement, (iii) ensure \nthat MEC makes automatic monthly payments into the sinking fund account, and (iv) ensure that \nMOF had the first priority right to receive payments from other assets of MEC in the event of a \ndefault in the obligation of MEC to contribute to the sinking fund account. In addition, the loan \nagreement required MEC to (i) open a separate account at a commercial bank dedicated to \nrepair and maintenance funds; and (ii) make automatic monthly payments into the repair and \nmaintenance account from its revenue accounts, to be used exclusively for repair, maintenance, \nprocurement of spare parts, materials, and equipment (and related labor costs) directly related \nto power generation and distribution. The government has complied with these covenants. \n \n11.  The program is aligned with the RMI country operations business plan (COBP), 2012\u2013\n2014 and ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2010\u20132014. It also applies lessons from earlier ADB policy \nprograms in the RMI and elsewhere in the Pacific, as well as ADB\u2019s approach to engaging with \nweakly  performing  countries,  notably  by  (i)  adopting  a  country-led  set  of  policy  actions \ndeveloped in an open, participatory manner and at a pace in keeping with country practices, and \n(ii) initiating long-term policy dialogue and providing targeted technical assistance (TA). \n \n                                                \n8  MEC. 2009.

Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be that the public sector provides more efficient and effective services to \nthe population. The outcome will be that the government achieves fiscal sustainability. For the \npurposes of the program, fiscal sustainability is defined as the Compact trust fund being on \ntrack to replace Compact grants in FY2024. \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  Output 1: Government\u2019s fiscal discipline improves over the medium term. Under \nsubprogram 1, the cabinet endorsed budget targets for FY2011 and FY2012 to bring budget \noutcomes in line with International Monetary Fund (IMF) recommendations. The key target was \na  budget  surplus  large  enough  to  fund  RMI  contributions  to  the  Compact  trust  fund. \nComplementary targets were set for other budget items, including civil servant wages and \nsalaries, grants and transfers, capital expenditure, and tax revenue. The cabinet also endorsed \ndebt management guidelines for the government and SOEs. \n \n14.  Under subprogram 2, these budget targets were to be implemented over FY2011 and \nFY2012, and fiscal restraint was to be maintained in the preparation of the budget for FY2013. \nTo  improve  fiscal  discipline,  subprogram  2  also  requires  adoption  of  a  public  sector  debt \nmanagement strategy and fiscal responsibility legislation, through an amendment to the existing \nFinancial Management Act, 1990. \n \n15.  The government does not have a medium-term debt management strategy, and it has \nrecognized that it needs to adopt a more comprehensive and integrated approach to ensure that \ndebt  is  maintained  at  sustainable  levels.  The  debt  management  strategy  will  provide  the \ngovernment with a path to restore debt sustainability, define its debt management objectives, \nset risk management strategies, and reduce the future financial burden of meeting its debt \nobligations. The existing Financial Management Act defines the general principles of managing \ngovernment finances but does not contain provisions for debt management. The amendment to \nthe act will therefore incorporate key components of the debt management policy. \n \n16.  The budget targets set under subprogram 1, and implemented under subprogram 2, are \nto be achieved through the actions of outputs 2 and 3, which are designed to restrain recurrent \nexpenditure and increase tax revenue. The medium-term direction underlying the program is an \nincrease  in  the  budget  surplus  to  5%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  by  FY2016,  as \nrecommended by the IMF (footnote 6). \n \n17.  Output 2: Cabinet enforces restraint on recurrent expenditure. Under subprogram 1, \nthe CAP Advisory Group prepared an independent review of public expenditure. The cabinet \nendorsed the CAP Advisory Group report and the actions recommended by the group to restrain \nrecurrent expenditure. These included removing funding for 50 vacant positions in the civil \nservice;  reducing  compensation  paid  to  landowners  for  MEC\u2019s  access  to  their  land;  and \nreducing the government's administrative expenditure on housing leases and rentals, electricity, \nwater, communications, vehicles, fuel, and professional services. In addition, a freeze on the \ngovernment\u2019s wage and salary bill, compensation paid to members of the Parliament (Nitijela), \nand housing allowances for public officials, was recommended by the CAP Advisory Group. \n ", "5 \nSubprogram 1 also supported workforce audits in three major ministries\u2014education, health, and \npublic works\u2014to guide efforts to raise the productivity of the civil service.11 \n \n18.  Under subprogram 2, these expenditure targets were to be met through the FY2011 and \nFY2012  budgets.  The  government  made  general  across-the-board  cuts  to  expenditure  in \nFY2010 (5.0%), FY2011 (5.5%), and FY2012 (budgeted expenditure maintained at FY2011 \nlevels), rather than adopting the targeted cuts as originally envisaged by the Advisory Group; \nhowever,  this  approach  resulted  in  the  majority  of  targets  being  met.  Subprogram 2  also \nextends the workforce audits to five more ministries and agencies\u2014finance, foreign affairs, \ninternal  affairs,  attorney-general\u2019s  office,  and  resources  and  development\u2014as  well  as  the \nNitijela, and begins actions to implement the findings in conjunction with the Public Service \nCommission. \n \n19.  Output  3:  Ministry  of  Finance  increases  tax  revenue.  Under  subprogram 1, the \nTRAM  Commission  completed  an  independent  assessment  of  the  tax  system  and \nrecommended actions to increase tax revenue. The cabinet endorsed both the report and the \nrecommendations. \n \n20.  Subprogram 2 requires implementation of the tax reforms as recommended by the \nTRAM Commission. The commission recommended replacing an array of existing taxes with a \nmodern  tax  regime  that  has  higher  revenue  potential.  The  proposed  new  taxes  are  a \nconsumption tax, an excise tax for certain goods (such as alcohol and fuel), a net profit tax for \nlarge businesses, and a modified wages and salaries tax. These will replace hotel taxes, import \nduties, various local taxes, and gross revenue taxes (except those on small businesses). The \nnew taxes are designed to reduce distortions facing producers and consumers. The commission \nalso recommended changes to the income tax by removing exemptions and adopting a tax-free \nthreshold to reduce its regressive aspects, and to improve tax administration by unifying tax \nadministration, strengthening tax audits, and harmonizing tax collection processes. \n \n21.  The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre has been providing support to the \ngovernment in this area. Under subprogram 2, legislation was introduced into Parliament in \nSeptember 2012. The Australian Agency for International Development has recruited an advisor \nfor MOF (Division of Customs, Treasury, Revenue and Taxation) to successfully implement the \nreforms over a 2-year period. Actions under way to improve tax administration focus on tax-filing \nassistance and tax payment, audit and investigations, objections and appeals, management of \ndelinquent taxpayers, and considering more efficient information technology systems. The level \nof  taxpayer  noncompliance  is  high,  and  relatively  simple  efforts  to  improve  tax  filing  and \npayment should yield solid revenue gains.12 \n \n22.  Raising compliance through more rigorous tax administration is expected to generate \nmost of the additional tax revenue targeted under the program, as the new taxes should be \nlargely revenue-neutral for existing taxpayers in the short-term. The medium-term target is to lift \nthe ratio of taxes to GDP to 16.2% in FY2015, from 14.3% in FY2011, as the IMF recommended. \n \n23.  Output  4:  Selected  state-owned  enterprises  improve  their  performance.  Under \nsubprogram 1, an assessment was conducted of the performance of the 11 major SOEs, and \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2009.

Suva. \n ", "6 \nthe  cabinet  endorsed  good  practice  principles  to  guide  the  ongoing  SOE  reform. 13  A \ncomprehensive recovery plan was prepared for MEC and endorsed by the MEC board, and \nimplementation commenced. The cabinet and the MEC board endorsed debt restructuring for \nMEC, and the MEC board endorsed the establishment of a maintenance account to hold funds \nset aside for maintenance. \n \n24.  Subprogram 2 provides for annual public reporting on SOE performance, the adoption of \nan SOE policy, the introduction of an SOE act in Parliament, the continued implementation of \nthe MEC comprehensive recovery plan, and the implementation of MEC's debt restructuring and \nmaintenance account. Time-bound recovery plans, based on the application of good practice \nprinciples, have been prepared under subprogram 2 for other SOEs. \n \n25.  The SOE policy confirms the government\u2019s commitment to 10 good practice principles \nfor the management and operation of SOEs, adopted under subprogram 1, and covers the role \nof the responsible minister, the principle objective for the operation of SOEs, community service \nobligations, governance, and accountability requirements. The key components of the policy will \nbe incorporated into an SOE act. Also under subprogram 2, strategic reform plans have been \nprepared for the Majuro Water and Sewer Company, Marshall Islands Shipping Corporation, \nand Tobolar Copra Processing Authority, and action is under way to implement the plans.14 \n \n26.  The  MEC  comprehensive  recovery  plan  includes  actions  to  (i)  improve  corporate \ngovernance  through  reconstitution  of  the  board,  (ii)  improve  procurement  and  financial \nmanagement, (iii) align tariffs to reflect costs, (iv) reduce system losses, (v) improve billing \nthrough prepaid metering and more rigorous collection, (vi) raise the efficiency of fuel usage, \n(vii) reduce nonessential expenditure, and (viii) overhaul the main generators and other major \nequipment (footnote 8). MEC's debt restructuring has three elements: (i) replacing a sovereign-\nguaranteed  loan  from  the  Bank  of  Guam  with  a  concessional  loan  from  the  government, \n(ii) deferring principal repayments on an existing loan from the Rural Utilities Service of the US \nDepartment of Agriculture, and (iii) establishing a debt-servicing sinking fund. \n \n27.  Output  5:  Cabinet  ensures  effective  stakeholder  participation  in  public  sector \nreforms. A consultation and participation program was started under subprogram 1, and has \nbeen ongoing under subprogram 2. Project preparatory TA under subprogram 1 assisted the \ngovernment  in  carrying  out  public  consultation,  bringing  together  stakeholders  from  the \ngovernment, civil society organizations, academia, the private sector, and youth groups in six \nsessions.15 Open debate on a wide range of issues yielded significant information, opinions, \ninsights, ideas, and recommendations. All consultations were bilingual. Each session covered \nthe economy, fiscal and economic trends and outlook, and policy options and actions. A strong \nconsensus emerged on key points related to ongoing economic difficulties, the necessity of \nadopting serious reforms to deal with imbalances, and the imperative that the cabinet take the \nlead in this reform process. \n \n28.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  has  sought  to  strengthen  engagement  with \ndevelopment partners to support its reform program.

The meeting gave the government a forum to present its public sector program. \nIt  discussed  the  RMI\u2019s  reform  and  development  progress  and  priorities,  which  included \nexpenditure reforms, tax and revenue reforms, energy sector reforms, and SOE performance \nand reform needs. The joint communiqu\u00e9 acknowledged that continued public outreach efforts \nwill be an important ingredient to successful implementation of the program.16 \n \n29.  Stakeholder  consultation  has  been  ongoing  since  the  approval  of  subprogram  1, \nparticularly around tax and SOE reform. In March 2012, ADB also approved TA with a provision \nto support a second development partners\u2019 meeting, once scheduled by the government.17 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n30.  The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR3,242,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 24-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement. \n \n31.  The  loan  size  was  determined  after  consideration  of  (i)  the  government\u2019s  FY2013 \nfinancing needs, including the required contribution to the Compact trust fund that is intended to \ngenerate a revenue stream to replace Compact grants in FY2024; (ii) the significance and \ncomplexity  of  the  policy  actions  of  the  program,  and  the  budgetary  resources  required  to \nimplement the program successfully; (iii) the conformity of the program with ADB\u2019s COBP for the \nRMI;  and  (iv)  direct  budget  support  being  provided  by  other  development  partners.  The \ndetermination  of  the  loan  size  also  took  into  account  the  government\u2019s  demonstrated \ncommitment  to  implementing  the  program,  as  evidenced  by  the  development  policy  letter \n(Appendix 3). \n \n32.  The proposed loan size is within the established lending allocation, and is included in \nADB\u2019s COBP for the RMI.18 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n33.  MOF will be the executing agency and will be responsible for (i) overseeing all policy, \nlegal, and regulatory actions to be undertaken in connection with the program; and (ii) ensuring \nthat all policy reforms set out in the policy matrix are duly carried out in a timely manner \n(Appendix 4). MOF will also be responsible for program administration, disbursements, and \nmaintenance of all program records. The public sector program period began on 25 August \n2009  and  all  subprogram  2  policy  actions  were  met  by  5  October  2012.19 Post-program \n                                                \n16 RMI. 2010.

Manila (TA 8061-RMI, for $225,000, approved on 20 March 2012). \n18 The RMI received an ADF allocation of $2.46 million for 2012, and it is proposed to bring forward the provisional \n2013 and 2014 allocations ($1.29 million each) so that subprogram 2 can be funded entirely from ADF. \n19 25 August 2009 was the date of the approval of the project preparatory TA (footnote 15). The subprogram 2 \nimplementation period began on 7 June 2011 (the day after approval of subprogram 1). \n ", "8 \nmonitoring efforts will continue through 2013. Ongoing TA activities have been supporting the \ngovernment in meeting the policy actions, and these will continue beyond loan effectiveness.20 \n \n34.  The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in a single tranche and in accordance with \nthe provisions of ADB's Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements \nfor Program Loans.21 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n35.  The  primary  gain  from  the  program  in  the  medium  term  will  be  improved  fiscal \nsustainability of the government, as measured by the Compact trust fund being on track to \nreplace Compact grants when they expire in FY2024. The IMF assessment letter is accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Governance \n36.  The government\u2019s ability to implement its budget as approved is integral to the success \nof the program. The general quality and comprehensiveness of the RMI budget has improved \nsince 2009, with the incorporation of previously off-budget allocations into the main allocation \nprocess. The budget planning and approval process has also improved, and the FY2011 and \nFY2012 budgets were being prepared largely in accordance with the set calendar and budget \nschedule, in part due to support from ADB. \n \n37.  Government procurement is undertaken in accordance with the Procurement Code (Act), \n1988 and applies to expenditure of public funds irrespective of their source by the government. \nThe code (i) aims to boost public confidence in the procedures followed in public procurement; \n(ii) ensures the fair and equitable treatment of all persons who deal with the  procurement \nsystem  of  the  government;  and  (iii) applies  greater  economy  to  government  procurement \nactivities, and maximizes the purchasing value of public funds of the government. Procurement \nrisks under the program are considered low. \n \n38.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MOF.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the program. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan agreement. These measures will complement the actions under way to improve financial \naccountability and anticorruption measures, which are being put in place by the government \nwith the support of its development partners. \n \n                                                \n20 ADB. 2010.

The program will contribute to poverty reduction in several ways. First, better fiscal \nmanagement will reduce fiscal deficits; improve the capacity to deal with external shocks; and \ncreate a foundation for sustainable, equitable, and inclusive pro-poor economic growth. Second, \nrevenue enhancement will enable the government to make transfers to the Compact trust fund, \nallowing a smooth transition to the post-Compact era, which could otherwise create social and \neconomic tension as public expenditure and employment shrink and as poverty and deprivation \nworsen. Third, improving the efficiency of SOEs, especially MEC, will reduce the burden that \ncash transfers place on the budget, and make additional resources available for development.22 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n40.  The  subprogram  is  classified  as  category  C  for  environment,  resettlement,  and \nindigenous  people.  No significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  have  been  identified.  No \ninvoluntary resettlement or impact on indigenous people is expected. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n41.  The potential benefits from undertaking fiscal and structural reforms to improve the long-\nterm fiscal sustainability of the RMI government are considered to outweigh the risks. Indeed, \nthe cost of inaction could be substantial\u2014a continued low growth rate, with implications for the \ngovernment\u2019s ability to fund basic social services and transition to the post-Compact era. Major \nrisks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and detailed in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.23 \n \nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe government\u2019s capacity to  Ongoing technical assistance activities have been supporting the \neffectively implement reforms  government in meeting the policy actions, and these will continue \nmay prove insufficient.  beyond loan effectiveness. \nThe current pace of reform may  Community demand for the program was built through the holding of \nnot be sustained if political  public symposia during subprogram 1.
