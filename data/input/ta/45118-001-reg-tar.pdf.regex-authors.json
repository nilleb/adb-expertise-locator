INTRODUCTION  \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been actively supporting trade and investment \nintegration as a means to achieve its overarching objective of poverty reduction in Asia and the \nPacific. ADB\u2019s regional departments and the Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI) \nare engaged in various capacity development activities nationally or regionally to enhance the \ncapacity of developing member countries (DMCs) to trade effectively and efficiently, thereby \nmaximizing the benefits of trade policy and facilitation initiatives.  \n \n2.  As  part  of  these  capacity  development  activities,  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  will \nestablish  a  network  of  trade  experts  which,  through  targeted  outputs,  aims  to  strengthen \ninstitutional  capacity  on  trade  policy  across  the  region.  The  network  will  support  regional \neconomic integration and is thereby anticipated to have a positive impact on cooperation among \ndeveloping countries.1 It will also support continued globalization of the region\u2019s trade and \ninvestment patterns and the region\u2019s participation in the successful conclusion of the Doha \nRound of the World Trade Organization (WTO).2 \n \n3.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy.3 The \nstrategy defines trade and investment cooperation and integration as one of its four pillars \n(pillar 2). The strategy provides the basis for ADB\u2019s capacity development initiatives in regional \ntrade.  OREI  is  ADB\u2019s  focal  point  for  pillar  2  and  has  expertise  in  research,  information \ndissemination, and capacity development pertaining to free trade agreements (FTAs), WTO \nagreements, and emerging trade policy issues. OREI is actively engaged with the WTO on trade \npolicy issues through the Aid for Trade Initiative, the Regional Technical Group on Aid for Trade, \nand the WTO\u2019s 2011 World Trade Report focusing on FTAs and multilateralizing regionalism. In \naddition, OREI is supporting the East Asia Department in its policy dialogue with the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China to speed up the creation of an East Asia free trade area, the Southeast Asia \nDepartment  as  peer  reviewer  for  trade  policy  loans,  and  the  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment in scaling up the Trade Finance Facilitation Program. The TA also stems from a \nrequest  made  by  Mari  Pangestu,  Indonesia\u2019s  trade  minister  and  the  2011  chair  of  the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), during a meeting with President Kuroda on 13 \nDecember 2010 at the ADB headquarters.4 \n \n4.  The TA paper reflects the purpose and output, methodology and key activities, cost \nestimates and financing plan, and implementation arrangements of this project.5 The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Trade patterns are in a state of flux in the rapidly evolving post-global financial crisis \nworld and, amid stalled Doha Round trade talks, there is a rapid spread of FTAs and a gathering \nmomentum for large intra- and interregional FTA proposals (e.g., ASEAN+3, ASEAN+6, the \nTrans-Pacific  Partnership  Agreement,  and  the  Free  Trade  Agreement  of  the  Asia-Pacific). \n                                                 \n1  This is often referred to as South-South cooperation. \n2  WTO. Doha Development Agenda. http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dda_e/dda_e.htm \n3  ADB. 2006. Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy. Manila. http://www.adb.org/documents/policies/rci-\nstrategy \n4  Indonesia is the chair of the ASEAN in 2011 and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation in 2013. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 April 2011. \n \n ", "2 \nDespite persistent and strong political signals from world leaders to conclude the Doha Round, \nand the resumption of negotiations in January 2011, it seems unclear whether economies will \novercome disagreement over liberalization of agriculture and non-agricultural market access in \nthe near future.6 Moreover, in the wake of high unemployment and increasing protectionist \nsentiments combined with a gathering momentum for regionalism, it is unclear where the much-\nneeded movement will come from. Instead, countries are seeking liberalization through bilateral \nand regional trade agreements. About 50 FTAs are in effect in East Asia alone, and many of \nthem are comprehensive \u201cnew age\u201d FTAs that include issues beyond goods and services. \nFurthermore, as trade liberalization inevitably brings adjustment to countries and sectors within \nthem, there is increasing focus on winners and losers from trade agreements (both the WTO-\nDoha Round and FTAs). Trade-related development assistance, including the WTO Aid-for-\nTrade Initiative (which emphasizes increasing cross-border infrastructure, trade policy reform, \nand supply side competitiveness policies), is seen as a means to alleviate adjustment costs at \nthe national and subregional levels.7 \n \n6.  Accordingly,  however,  regional  trade  negotiations  are  becoming  more  complex  and \ndifficult as they increasingly deal with matters that go beyond traditional tariff and nontariff \nbarriers  and  tackle  topics  such  as  investment,  competition,  trade  facilitation,  government \nprocurement, intellectual property rights, environment, and labor standards. Meanwhile, trade \npolicy capacity (embodied in trade ministries and think tanks) varies significantly across the \nregion, with notable gaps in low-income developing economies. There is a growing and urgent \nneed  to  increase  the  capacity  of  the  region\u2019s  trade  officials  and  think  tanks  to  analyze \nimplications and formulate competitiveness-enhancing trade policies. Supporting the high-level \nglobal and regional dialogue on Aid for Trade (WTO global Aid-for-Trade review meetings, \nregional Aid-for-Trade review meetings, and the Regional Technical Group on Aid-for-Trade for \nAsia  and  the  Pacific)  and  the  preparation  of  analytical  reports  as  required  are  crucial  for \ndeveloping a strategy for the region.  \n \n7.  To  meet  this  need,  the  TA  will  set  up  an  open-ended,  internet-based  network  of \ninternational  economic  policy  experts  and  scholars  in  Asia\u2014to  be  known  as  the  Asian \nInternational  Economists  Network\u2014with  which  policymakers  can  interact  when  serious \ndiscussions about trade policies are required. The TA will also develop a database and online \ntools for trade policy analysis; organize training programs and conferences on new trade issues; \nprovide opportunities for informal policy dialogues and roundtable discussions among trade \nministers, ADB Management, and trade experts; run a research associates program on new \ntrade issues; and undertake policy-oriented research. Issues will be prioritized according to \ndemand from network participants.  \n \n8.  A parallel and simultaneous development is the mainstreaming of trade-related work \nwithin ADB. ADB could consider at a later date the establishment of a trade group within the \ncommunity  of  practice  on  regional  cooperation  and  integration  (RCI  CoP),  or  possibly  a \nseparate community of practice on trade if warranted. The TA will draw on ADB\u2019s experience in \n                                                 \n6  The Doha Round has been ongoing since November 2001 and is probably the longest and most ambitious \nmultilateral trade negotiation to date.  \n7  ADB Management has led efforts to support the WTO in implementing the Aid-for-Trade Initiative in the Asia-\nPacific. President Kuroda has emphasized the Two Faces of the Asia-Pacific and underlined the need for more \nAid-for-Trade to close the gap. See President Kuroda\u2019s speeches at the 2007 Regional Review Meeting in Manila \nand  the  2009  Global  Review  Meeting  in  Geneva.  http://aric.adb.org/aid-for-trade-asia/pdf/ADB_Pres  Kuroda \n_Openingremarks.pdf; http://aric.adb.org/aid-for-trade-asia/pdf/ADB_PresKuroda_Closingremarks.pdf; http://www. \nadb.org/Documents/Speeches/2009/ms2009052.asp.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  stronger  national  and  regional  trade  policies  and \ncooperation of trade ministries, policymakers, and trade experts in Asia. Enhanced policies and \ncooperation  among  policymakers  and  trade  experts  in  the  region  will  lead  to  more  trade \ncooperation among developing countries, which is an important aspect of sustaining Asian and \nglobal economic recovery. \n \n10.  The outcome will be enhanced trade policy capacity among network members to deal \nwith issues in second-generation FTA negotiations through analysis, policy formulation, and \ninformation creation and dissemination. The TA will also strengthen the engagement of ADB \nand the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) with development partners (e.g., Organisation \nfor Economic Co-operation and Development, World Bank, and WTO). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will cover the entire Asia and Pacific region. Taking on capacity development for \nsuch a large and diverse group of countries is a challenging task. The different trade and \ninvestment interests and needs across the region must therefore be taken into account in TA \nimplementation, as one size does not fit all. Differentiated approaches might be needed. \n \n12.  The TA will have six major components.  \n \n13.  Output 1: Creation of a platform for network interaction and development of a \ndatabase and online tools for trade policy analysis. A virtual, web-based platform will be \ndeveloped  to  facilitate  interaction  among  network  members.  The  network  will  be  centered \naround this new platform, accessible to all parties, so that network members can interact both \nvirtually and at network events (such as conferences and policy dialogues). The network will \nconsist of trade ministers and other officials involved in formulating trade policies (e.g., officials \nfrom finance ministries, commerce ministries), scholars, think tank researchers, ADB and ADBI \nstaff, and other relevant parties from across the Asia and Pacific region. The network will be \nopen to all regional groupings, (e.g., ASEAN, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, Boao Forum \nfor  Asia,  Brunei  Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines  East  ASEAN  Growth  Area, \n                                                 \n8  Relevant TA projects include: ADB. 2006.

Rules and \nregulations governing the operation of the network will be formulated by network members. \nFurthermore, network members, together with outside experts (as appropriate), will be engaged \nin the development of online tools for trade policy analysis using the platform of the Asia \nRegional Integration Center website. The web-based platform will also take stock of all trade-\nrelated publications and activities of ADB and outputs of network members.  \n \n14.  Output 2: Training programs on new trade issues. At least two training programs \ndealing with designing and implementing second-generation trade issues for negotiating FTAs \nand global trade agreements will be held during TA implementation. The content will cover the \nfour Singapore issues (investment, competition, trade facilitation, government procurement)10 \nand sensitive topics such as intellectual property rights, environment, and labor standards. It will \nbe targeted at upgrading skills of middle-level and junior officials involved in formulating trade \npolicies, negotiating trade agreements, and advising ministers. If there is demand, specialist \ncourses dealing with individual new trade issues may also be conducted during the project, \npossibly  through  cofinancing.  To  the  extent  possible,  each  subregional  grouping  will  be \nrepresented in training courses. Training and information dissemination through e-learning will \nalso be conducted using the network\u2019s internet-based resources (output 1).  \n \n15.  Output 3: Conferences on new trade issues. To sustain the network, two international \nconferences will be held during TA implementation. The conferences will focus on the latest \ndevelopments in new trade issues in FTAs and global agreements, fine points of trade theory \nand legal aspects of new trade issues, examples of good practice, considerations of political \neconomy, and Aid-for Trade issues at the global and regional levels, including the Regional \nTechnical Group on Aid-for-Trade. Trade experts, senior trade officials, ministers, and ADB \nand/or ADBI staff will participate in these conferences. If there is sufficient demand, specialist \nconferences dealing with individual new trade issues may be undertaken through cofinancing. \nTrade ministers and eminent trade experts will be invited to give keynote lectures. Participation \nof network members will be in person or by videoconference, and the lectures will be recorded \nfor repeat viewing by network members.  \n \n16.  Output 4: Informal policy dialogues and roundtable discussions. To boost further \ninteraction in the network, informal policy dialogues and roundtable discussions among trade \nministers, the ADB Management, and trade experts will be held. These will discuss pros and \ncons of alternative policy choices and review best practices with a view to formulating policies \nand negotiating approaches to new trade issues. The Chatham House Rule will apply.  \n \n17.  Output 5: A research associates program at ADB and/or ADBI on new trade issues. \nUp to six research associates will be engaged to support the work of the network, conduct \nresearch, and promote capacity development. Contracts ranging from 6 months to 1 year will be \nprovided. Research associates will have a master\u2019s degree in economics or law and a minimum \nof 2 years work experience. The positions will be advertised and selection based on merit.  \n \n                                                 \n10 These four issues are often referred to as \"Singapore issues\" because they formally became part of the WTO \nagenda  at  the  1996  Singapore  Ministerial  Conference.  The  four  subjects  were  later  included  in  the  Doha \nDevelopment Agenda in 2001, but in 2004 the parties decided to proceed with negotiations in only one subject, \n(trade facilitation). Negotiations on some or all four topics are today present in most regional FTA negotiations. ", "  5\n18.  Output  6:  Policy-oriented  research. A training manual on best practices for trade \nnegotiators, a series of short policy briefs and working papers, reports on emerging policy \nissues (including Aid-for-Trade and general equilibrium modeling of trade and economic issues), \nand a book of forward-looking essays written by leading trade experts and senior researchers \nwill be published and made available through the websites of ADB and ADBI.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). Appendix 2 provides details of \nthe cost estimates and financing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  ADB will be the executing agency. OREI will be the focal point for the TA and will \nimplement  the  TA  with  the  assistance  of  regional  departments,  ADBI,  the  Economics  and \nResearch Department, and international and national consultants and resource persons. To \nmaximize  synergies,  a  meeting  will  be  held  with  regional  departments  at  the  start  of  TA \nimplementation to discuss directions, activities, inputs, and co-financing. The RCI CoP will be \nused for regular discussions (see para. 8). A small, full-time project secretariat based at the \nADB headquarters will provide logistical and technical support. The secretariat will consist of a \nfull-time project manager and a researcher, each to be engaged for 30 person-months. A trade \neconomist or macroeconomist will be engaged intermittently for 9 person-months to prepare \npapers,  policy  briefs,  and  a  manual.  Through  the  research  associates  program,  up  to  six \nresearch  associates  will  be  engaged  as  consultants.  To  design  and  develop  the  network \nwebsite, a web developer will be engaged intermittently for 6 person-months. Resource persons \nwill  also  be  engaged  from  time  to  time  to  accomplish  short-term  activities  under  the  TA. \nConsultants will be selected and engaged by ADB individually in accordance with the Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n21.  Equipment for the database will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, amended from time to time). The equipment will be purchased through the \nADB Procurement and Contracts Administration Unit and will be assigned to the secretariat of \nthe  Asian  International  Economists  Network.  Upon  TA  completion,  the  equipment  will  be \ndisposed of in compliance with ADB\u2019s project administration instructions on administering grant-\nfinanced technical assistance projects.11 \n \n22.  A no-objection letter will be obtained before commencing or financing any undertaking in \nthe  territory  of  any  DMC.  The  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, amended from time to time). The TA is expected to \nbe completed within 36 months, from June 2011 to June 2014.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,100,000 on a grant basis \nfor Establishing the Asian International Economists Network, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2009.
