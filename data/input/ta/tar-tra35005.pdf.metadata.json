INTRODUCTION\n1. Since 1978, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has helped borrowers and executing\nagencies (EAs) strengthen their capabilities to manage project implementation through regional\nand country training programs on project implementation and administration. By the end of\n2000, ADB had conducted 158 training programs under regional technical assistance (TA)\ngrants. A total of 4,674 senior and mid-level officials of EAs, central ministries, and state banks\nfrom 30 developing member countries (DMCs) have participated in these training programs.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2.  Two core governance activities that cut across all sectors and on which ADB  will focus\nin  the  medium  term  are  capacity  building  and  policy  reform.  Training  programs  and\ndocumentation (guidelines, policies, and standard bidding documents) provided under this TA1\nare part of a systematic and long-term approach to capacity building for project implementation\nin  the  DMCs.  The  TA  fulfills  two  capacity  building  activities\u2014institution  strengthening  and\nhuman resource development. The training programs and documentation also indirectly support\nother governance activities such as accountability, transparency, and anticorruption efforts.\n3. Current  initiatives  to  improve  portfolio  management  emphasize  DMC  ownership  of\nprojects and capabilities for project implementation. The ability to implement projects efficiently\nand economically depends on the knowledge, skills, and experience of the staff of project EAs.\nMany personnel in the DMCs have acquired substantial experience in project implementation\nover the years. However,  practical and regular training in procurement and administration and\nother project implementation activities is needed to (i) familiarize new EAs that are entrusted\nwith implementing ADB-assisted projects and are either from new borrowing member countries\nor from DMCs that may have previously borrowed from ADB, but are not yet fully familiar with\nADB\u2019s guidelines on procurement and the use of consultants, disbursement procedures, and\nother associated project implementation and administration procedures; and (ii) train EAs that\nhave already administered ADB-assisted projects but may need to transfer and replace staff of\nongoing ADB-assisted projects, and/or acquire new staff for new projects. Project managers,\nespecially those newly appointed, need to be introduced to the latest concepts and techniques\nof project implementation and administration, and to the guidelines, policies, and procedures on\nprocurement, consulting services, and disbursements; and to learn lessons from earlier projects.\n4. Country  portfolio  review  missions  routinely  determine  that  delays  in  project\nimplementation are, to a large extent, caused by a lack of understanding of, and unfamiliarity\nwith,  ADB\u2019s  requirements  and  guidelines.  This  is  complicated  by  inconsistencies  and\ncontradictions between ADB requirements and those of other multilateral development banks\n(MDBs). Recent initiatives to improve portfolio management confirmed these findings. The TA\ntraining  programs  are  designed  to  address  these  constraints  by  upgrading  project\nimplementation skills of EA personnel and  improving familiarity with, and application of, the\nguidelines, policies, and procedures on procurement, consulting services, and disbursements.\nThe documentation component of the TA will address the growing need to revise procurement\npolicies,  practices,  and  guidelines  used  by  ADB\u2019s  borrowers,  to  make  them  current  with\ninternational standards and convergent with those of the other MDBs. The TA will assist ADB\u2019s\ncontribution to the efforts of the MDBs to harmonize procurement practices and make it easier\nfor  borrowers  to  work  within  a  convergent  procurement  environment.2  The  objective  is  to\nestablish a framework and set policies to streamline procedures, reduce contradictions between\nthe requirements of different MDBs, and reduce transaction costs.\n                                                          \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in January 2001.\n2  ADB currently contributes through the MDB Procurement Cooperation Group, attended by the MDB heads of\nprocurement and supported by a technical working group.", "2\n5. Evaluation and feedback from past seminars indicate that the training programs are\nsuccessful in strengthening participants' professional skills and increasing their understanding of\nADB\u2019s requirements relating to project implementation and administration. The structure and\ncontent of the seminars are being continually revised and improved based on suggestions from\nparticipants and in response to the changing needs of EAs and ADB. The harmonization of\ndocumentation has been introduced to provide a more complete and well-rounded capacity\nbuilding intervention. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nIll. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n6. The TA seminars in the program will provide project directors, managers, and other key\nEA staff with an understanding of modern principles and techniques of project management and\nimplementation,  and  will  familiarize  them  with  ADB's  guidelines  and  procedures  for  the\nprocurement of goods and works, selection and engagement of consultants, disbursements,\nand other associated activities. The TA will further the goal to harmonize ADB requirements with\nthose  of  other  MDBs,  making  procurement  and  consultant  selection  more  efficient.  The\nseminars will also provide the trainees with a valuable opportunity to share and learn from the\nexperience of participants from different sector organizations within a DMC or, in the case of\nregional seminars, from other DMCs within the region, thereby supporting regional cooperation.\nB. Scope\n7. One regional and seven country seminars on project implementation and administration\nwill be conducted between 1 April 2001 and 31 March 2002. The regional seminar will be held at\nADB headquarters in Manila. The country seminars will address country concerns (para. 8). The\n10-day regional seminar will cover a broad range of activities related to project implementation.\nNewly appointed project directors and senior policymakers of central agencies will be selected\nto form the target group.\n8. The country seminars will be conducted in the People\u2019s Republic of China, Lao People's\nDemocratic  Republic,  Pakistan,  Philippines,  Viet  Nam,  and  two  other  countries  yet  to  be\ndetermined. Countries selected include (i) DMCs in which loans approved in 2000 involved new\nimplementing  EAs,  (ii)  DMCs  receiving  a  large  number  of  loans  annually,  (iii)  DMCs  that\nrequested inclusion and (iv) DMCs that were indicated as needing the seminar as a result of\nanalyses undertaken during country portfolio review missions. For the two countries yet to be\nidentified, consideration will be given to new borrowers, such as the Central Asian republics\n(CARs). All programs divisions will be canvased prior to making the final selection. The scope\nand content of the country seminars will be similar to those of the regional seminars (para. 7).\nCrosscutting issues will be covered only in general terms because of constraints in arranging for\nstaff  specialists  to  travel  to  the  selected  DMCs.  The  target  group  will  consist  of  project\nmanagers and mid-level project staff.\n9.  A consultant will be recruited to develop a framework and policy on revising procurement\npractices, policies, and guidelines to harmonize with requirements of other MDBs and to update\nthese in line with international best practices. These updated materials will be used for future\ntraining (of ADB and other MDBs) and be disseminated to EAs to strengthen their capacity to\nundertake procurement.", "3\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n10. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, which will support the one\nregional seminar, seven country seminars, and required consulting services. The detailed cost\nestimates are shown in Appendix 2. This TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the\nADB-funded TA Program.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n11. Regional seminars will focus on the responsibilities of project managers for planning,\norganizing, resourcing, budgeting, scheduling, directing, monitoring, controlling, and evaluating\nproject implementation. The program will follow the sample seminar outline shown in Appendix\n3. For the country seminars, the methods of instruction will include lectures, case studies, class\nexercises, and workshops. The seminars will be carried out in English; where necessary, the\nresource  persons  will  be  assisted  by  interpreters.  The  lectures  will  deal  with  project\nimplementation concepts and systems, including explanations for adapting them to the local\nproject  setting.  The  case  studies  will  analyze  problem  situations  and  the  decision-making\nprocess.  The  class  exercises  will  test  and  reinforce  the  participants'  abilities  to  apply\nimplementation tools and techniques in relation to the types of projects assisted by ADB. An\nimportant  feature  of  each  seminar  will  be  a  workshop  on  the  problems  and  issues  the\nparticipants have encountered in their projects.\n12. Invitations will be extended to project directors and managers, and to other key staff\nfrom the EAs of ADB-assisted projects. As far as possible, they will be drawn from projects that\nare at the inception stage. Participation of selected policymakers from central agencies involved\nin  the  formulation  of  financial  and  procurement  regulations  will  be  encouraged.  About  40\nparticipants  for  the  regional  seminar  and  30  participants  for  each  country  seminar  will  be\nselected in consultation with ADB's projects departments and resident/regional missions. All of\nthe seminars are expected to be held between April 2001 and March 2002. The resource\npersons for both the country and regional seminars will be ADB staff, particularly procurement\nand consulting services specialists from the Central Operations Services Office and staff from\nthe Controller\u2019s Department.\n13.  ADB  will  engage  a  consultant  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants.  The  consultant  will  be  a  procurement  expert  with  full  knowledge  of  the\nprocurement policies, practices and standard documents of the MDBs. The consultant\u2019s work\nwill be managed by Project Coordination & Procurement Division. Outline terms of reference are\nprovided in Appendix 4. Approximately, four person months of services will be provided between\nJune and December 2001.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n14. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$600,000 for the purpose of Capacity Building for Project Implementation and Administration,\nand hereby reports such action to the Board.", "4 Appendix 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Targets/ Performance Monitoring Assumptions and\nIndicators Mechanisms Risks\n Goal\nImprove the quality of project Percentage of DMC project portfolio \u2022  Reports of country \u2022  Project implementation\nimplementation in the developing rated \u201cat risk\u201d by 2005 reduced portfolio review missions schedules unrealistic\nmember countries (DMCs) significantly compared with baseline at \u2022  Review of Project \u2022  Corrupt practices\nend of 2000 Performance Reports \u2022  Political instability\n\u2022  Natural disasters\nPurpose\nUpgrade the project Provide new project directors, \u2022  Reports of country \u2022  Caliber of personnel from\nimplementation skills of executing managers, and other key staff of portfolio review missions DMCs nominated to\nagency personnel and improve their executing agencies with modern \u2022  Reports of review participate in the training\nfamiliarity with Asian Development principles, techniques, and missions programs\nBank (ADB) policies and procedures documentation for project \u2022  Quality and useability of\nrelated to project implementation and implementation and administration, documentation\nadministration and familiarize them with  ADB\u2019s\nguidelines and procedures related to\nproject implementation and\nadministration.\nOutputs\n\u2022  A regional seminar on project \u2022  40 participants consisting of \u2022  Seminar attendance and \u2022  Caliber of personnel\nimplementation and project directors and senior postseminar evaluations nominated by DMCs\nadministration in Manila policymakers from DMCs to be by participants \u2022  Participants will apply\n\u2022  Seven country seminars on trained for each seminar. \u2022  Reports of MDB concepts, policies,\nproject implementation and \u2022  30 participants consisting of Procurement Cooperation procedures, and\nadministration project managers and mid-level Group guidelines to ongoing\n\u2022  Draft harmonization framework project staff to be trained for each projects in their\n\u2022  Multilateral Development Bank seminar respective areas of\n(MDB) master procurement \u2022  Documentation policy and responsibility\npolicy framework that can be used by \u2022  Consultant is competent\n\u2022  Standard documents for MDBs to harmonize bidding\nprequalification, consulting procedures and practices\nservices, procurement\nActivities\n\u2022  Planning and design of seminars As per Project Coordination and \u2022  Postseminar evaluations \u2022  Suitable facilities are\nincluding proposed budget, Procurement Division internal planning by participants available within budget\nscope, and venue and scheduling \u2022  Project Coordination and constraints, when needed\n\u2022  Selection of participants and Procurement Division \u2022  ADB resource pesonnel\nresource persons for seminar internal reports are available to support\n\u2022  Implementation of seminars \u2022  Procurement Cooperation seminars, when\n\u2022  Documentation review and Group review scheduled\nrevision, and development of \u2022  Sufficient number of\npolicy and framework appropriate DMC\n\u2022  MDB coordination personnel are available to\nparticipate\n\u2022  Consultant is competent\nInputs Resources\n\u2022  Resource persons consisting of Approximately $259,500 for  the\nADB staff from Consulting regional seminar, $31,600 for each\nServices Division, Project country seminar, and $120,000 for\nCoordination and Procurement consulting services\nDivision, Controller\u2019s, and other\nconcerned departments Total $600,000\n\u2022  Consulting services\n(Reference in text: page 2, para. 5)", "5 Appendix 2\nCOST ESTIMATES\n($)\nItem Cost\nA.
