The Asian Development Bank (ADB) fielded a Fact-Finding Mission in April 2008 upon \nthe request of the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam (the Government) for \nproject preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)1 to prepare the proposed Hai Phong Water \nSupply Project (HWSP). The HWSP will assist in improving water supply services for residents \nof Hai Phong and contribute to achieving the related Millennium Development Goals (MDG).2 \nThe  objectives,  scope,  cost,  financing  plan,  implementation  arrangements,  and  terms  of \nreference for the PPTA are based on the understanding reached with the Government during \nthe Fact-Finding Mission. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  proposed  HWSP  results  from  water  financing  conferences  held  in  Manila  in \nSeptember 2006, with a follow-on conference in Hanoi in March 2007. The project addresses \nsustainable water supply for the short and medium term in Hai Phong, the third largest city in \nViet Nam and main port for the capital, Hanoi. Hai Phong is developing rapidly and has made \nconsiderable  socioeconomic  development  gains  over  recent  years.  The  city\u2019s  economy  is \ngrowing at around 11% annually, exceeding Viet Nam\u2019s economic growth rate of about 8%. This \ngrowth rate places serious strain on the city\u2019s infrastructure, including on its water supply \nsystem.  \n \n3.  Given the importance of the city to Viet Nam\u2019s socioeconomic development and the \nneed to upgrade its infrastructure to respond to growing demand for improved basic urban \nservices, the Government requested that the project be included in ADB\u2019s Water Financing \nProgram for Viet Nam. The project is directly linked to the agenda of assisting and supporting \ninfrastructure development in the Viet Nam country strategy and program (2007\u20132010).3  \n \n4.  Hai Phong has a population of 1.7 million, of which 700,000 live in urban districts. The \ncity has an area of 1,500 km2, including seven urban districts and seven peri-urban. The water \ncompany  was  founded  more  than  100  years  ago.  A  prolonged  period  of  underinvestment \nbrought a water crisis in 1993, which was overcome when the water company successfully \nimplemented programs to improve water supply financed by Finland and the World Bank. \nNonrevenue water has been reduced from 70% in 1993 to 25% today, while the number of \nconnections increased from 21,900 to 180,000. In central urban areas, water is provided 24 \nhours a day, but in peri-urban areas supply can be intermittent, averaging only 14 hours per \nday. Since 2004, the water company has been International Standards Organization (ISO) \n9001:2000 certified for quality management and quality assurance. Hai Phong Water Supply \nOne Member Company (HPWSCO) employs 830 staff and has in place an ongoing program for \ndeveloping human resources and training staff. There are 4.6 staffers per 1,000 connections, \nwhich is very efficient compared with many other water companies in the region. Water tariffs \nare at cost recovery, with the domestic water tariff at $0.18 per cubic meter (m3), and water \nquality complies with national standards. In 2007, annual revenues were $10.5 million. \n \n5.  The main water sources are three rivers\u2014 the An Kim Hai, Da Do, and Gia\u2014the water \nfrom which is treated in four water treatment plants (WTPs) with a total capacity of 178,000 \nm3/day. To achieve 90% coverage by 2020, the water company seeks ADB assistance to \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 May 2008. \n2  Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability, of which Target 10 is to halve, by 2015, the portion of people without \nsustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation. \n3 ADB. 2006. Viet Nam: Country Strategy and Program (2007\u20132010). Manila. \n ", "2   \nupgrade two existing WTPs and construct a new WTP and related distribution network. The \nadditional water treatment capacity of 110,000 m3/day will increase water purification capacity \nby more than 60%. In areas without piped water supply, residents rely mostly on water provided \nby informal vendors and self-supplied groundwater that is subject to pollution and poses a \nhealth risk. \n \n6.  The  main  issues  affecting  Hai  Phong  water  supply  include  the  need  to  (i)  expand \ndomestic  service  coverage,  particularly  in  peri-urban  areas;  (ii)  improve  water  supply  for \ncommercial use to support rapid economic development in the city; (iii) provide continuous \nwater  supply  24  hours  a  day  at  appropriate  pressure;  (iv)  further  reduce  and  manage \nnonrevenue water levels in district meter areas; (v) increase water purification capacity and \ndevelop new water sources; (vi) raise customer awareness for water conservation; and (vii) \ncontinue capacity development to cope with business growth, further improve financial and \noperational performance, and prepare for potential private sector participation in the future. \n \n7.  While  HPWSCO  is  in  charge  of  water  supply  services,  wastewater  and  drainage \nmanagement is the responsibility of a separate entity, the Hai Phong Sewerage and Drainage \nCompany. The city is partly served by a sewer system and successfully implemented over \nrecent  years  major  wastewater  management  and  environmental  improvement  programs \nfinanced by Finnish International Development Assistance and the World Bank. In 2005, the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation approved an additional sanitation project to further \nenhance drainage, solid waste management, and wastewater collection and treatment in Hai \nPhong. This program will provide the city\u2019s first wastewater treatment plant, another major step \nforward in reducing environmental pollution and further enhancing public health and the city\u2019s \nlivability. As sanitation issues are already well covered by other donors, the HWSP will primarily \naddress improvements to water supply.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The PPTA for preparing the HWSP will help to enhance the performance and efficiency \nof water supply services for Hai Phong\u2019s urban and peri-urban residents. The HWSP will (i) \nimprove the living conditions and health of residents, (ii) redress water-supply inadequacy as a \nfactor  limiting  economic  growth  and  development,  and  (iii)  help  to  improve  institutional \nconstraints affecting the sector. The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n \n9.  The outcome of the PPTA will be agreement on the design of the ensuing loan project by \nHPWSCO, the Government, and ADB. The PPTA will (i) prepare components for improving the \nHai Phong water supply system and enhancing performance; (ii) develop the HWSP to a level of \ndetail suitable for consideration by ADB for funding; and (iii) prepare implementation support \nand  institutional  development  programs  addressing  sector  reform,  governance,  and  public \nawareness. The ensuing loan project worth $30 million is expected to materialize in 2009. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The consultant will prepare the feasibility study under the PPTA for the HWSP using a \nconsultative process. The project will be developed in accordance with relevant national legal \nrequirements and standards and ADB requirements, policies, and guidelines. The PPTA will \ninvestigate  innovative  financing  schemes  for  improving  urban  water  supply  through,  for \n ", "3 \nexample,  local  currency  financing,  municipal  bonds,  and  public-private  partnerships  as \napplicable. The PPTA will be carried out in two phases that may overlap. \n \n11.  Phase 1. The first phase is expected to be implemented in about 3 months and will \naddress (i) water demand planning, (ii) water conservation, and (iii) financial and institutional \nanalyses of HPWSCO. \n \n(i)  Water demand planning. The consultant will develop a model that will allow \nforecasting water demand for the city until 2020 and determining how to meet \ndemand from various water sources. The consultant will review existing studies \nand project proposals for related investment, including levels of preparedness \nand the need for updating. The consultant will confirm the project proposals and, \nif required, update them such that ADB can consider financing them. \n(ii)  Water conservation. The PPTA will review and assess the potential for water \nconservation for all consumer groups, measures required for reducing water \nconsumption, and outline a program for building awareness. \n(iii)  Financial  and  institutional  analyses.  The  consultant  will  assess  in  detail \nHPWSCO\u2019s  financial  management  capacity  and  financial  state  and  analyze \nmajor  constraints  to  its  financial  sustainability.  The  PPTA  will  include  an \ninstitutional analysis, identify issues and areas for improvement, and recommend \nrelated development activities. \n \n12.  Phase 2. Subject to the findings of phase 1, the consultant, in agreement with HPWSCO \nand ADB, will proceed with the preparation of phase 2, which will last 8 months. This will include \n(i) preparing an investment program and packaging of the HWSP to a level of detail suitable for \nconsideration  by  ADB  for  funding,  (ii)  developing  implementation  and  fund-channeling \narrangements, and (iii) preparing capacity-development programs. \n \n13.  The scope of phase 2 will address in particular (i) increasing the capacity of two existing \nWTPs in An Duong and Vat Cach; (ii) constructing a new WTP in Kim Son; (iii) rehabilitating the \nexisting WTP at Do Son and converting it into a pumping station, with the construction of \ntransmission mains, distribution network, and service connections; and (iv) related capacity \ndevelopment. \n \n(i)  Feasibility study and basic design.4 The consultant will prepare a feasibility \nstudy and basic design for (a) increasing the capacity of WTP Vat Cach from \n10,000  m3/day  to  30,000  m3/day,  including  about  18  kilometers  (km)  of \ntransmission mains; (b) increasing the capacity of WTP An Duong from 100,000 \nm3/day to 180,000 m3/day, including about 4 km of raw water transmission pipe, \na storage reservoir with a capacity of 6,000 m3, and related installations; (c) \nconstructing the new WTP Kim Son with a capacity of 10,000 m3/day, including 1 \nkm of transmission main; and (d) rehabilitating WTP Do Son and converting it \ninto a pumping station, and constructing 6 km of transmission mains and a \ndistribution network that includes 13,000 house connections in Do Son district. \nHPWSCO is reviewing additional water supply components (e.g., WTP Ngu Lao, \ntransmission mains, and distribution network) that may replace one or more of \n                                                 \n4  The preparation of the feasibility study has to comply with relevant national laws, regulations, and standards, \nincluding  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Decision  No.  48/2008/QD-TTg,  Decision  on  Issuance  of  Common  General \nGuidelines on Feasibility Study Preparation for Official Development Assistance (ODA) Projects Funded by the \nFive Banks (ADB, AFD, JBIC, KfW, World Bank).

The  consultant  will  review  and  assess  the \norganizational and institutional arrangements of HPWSCO and outline a program \nof  financial  and  operational  performance  improvement,  including  terms  of \nreference for consultant support and cost estimates. The consultant will provide \ninitial  training  for  HPWSCO  staff  on  the  relevant  ADB  procedures  regarding \nprocurement, recruiting consultants, and environmental and social safeguards. \n \n14.  An assessment of innovative financing schemes for improving urban water supply will be \ncarried out, including, for example, local currency financing, municipal bonds, refinancing and \nrestructuring, and public-private partnerships as applicable. The PPTA will review and assess \noptions for revolving funds for financing charges for water supply connections.6 It will develop \ncapacity-building components, including programs for further strengthening the financial and \noperational performance of HPWSCO. Activities under phase 2 will be supported by workshops \nand seminars aiming to disseminate information, develop institutional capacity, and implement \nsupport. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $1.25 million, of which $1 million will be \nfinanced as a grant from the Netherlands Trust Fund for the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility,  to  be  administered  by  ADB.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  cost  of \n$250,000 through in-kind contributions, which cover office and support facilities, counterpart \nstaff, administrative support, and local transportation for counterpart staff. The Government and \nHPWSCO have been informed that approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. Cost estimates and the financing plan for the PPTA are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the PPTA will be HPWSCO, which has an existing \nproject management unit (PMU) experienced in implementing donor-financed programs. The \nPMU will be responsible for organizing the technical and administrative aspects of the PPTA \nand for day-to-day decisions affecting its conduct. The PMU will include suitably qualified and \nexperienced counterpart staff working alongside the PPTA consultants. PMU staff will include a \ndirector,  an  English-speaking  coordinator,7 and  4\u20135  counterpart  personnel  for  engineering, \ninstitutional, and financial matters. The PPTA consultant will provide full support to the head of \nthe PMU and will work in close collaboration with the counterpart team. A steering committee \nchaired by Hai Phong People's Committee and comprising senior officials from HPWSCO and \nHai Phong People's Committee agencies will be established to provide guidance and oversee \nPPTA implementation. The steering committee will meet at least once every 2 months. \n \n17.  The PPTA will require 77 person-months of consulting services, 22 international and 55 \nnational. One consultant can cover more than one field of expertise. All international consultants \nshould have relevant regional experience, preferably in Viet Nam. One of the international \nconsultants will, besides providing technical expertise, act as team leader, and one of the \n                                                 \n5 The consultant will review and update existing studies and design as applicable.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  The Viet Nam country strategy and program, 2007\u20132010,a stresses the importance of maintaining sustainable equitable \neconomic growth to achieve further reductions in poverty. Viet Nam\u2019s success in bringing down the share of the population \nliving in poverty from 70% in 1990 to 27% in 2005 relied on rapid, equitable economic growth. The Government\u2019s strategy for \nHai Phong is to develop infrastructure, including water and sanitation, to improve service quality and expand services to urban \nand peri-urban areas. The proposed project is expected to update demand projections, upgrade existing water purification \ncapacity, prepare new water sources, improve and expand the water transmission and distribution network, and enhance the \nefficiency of operations. In addition, the project will include capacity development and institutional strengthening for Hai Phong \nWater Supply One Member Company. These measures will contribute to improving the quality of life and the city\u2019s ability to \nattract investment.  \n \nB.    Targeting Classification \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification: The project will look at improving service delivery and expanding water \nsupply coverage in Hai Phong.  \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  Not applicable \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence?  \n \nA total of 9 person-months of international and national consultancy and a provisional sum of $10,000 for the social and \nenvironmental assessment surveys. \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross-subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)?  \n \nThe project will assess the water tariff structure and its impact on connecting the urban poor. The design of the ensuing \ninvestment program will be based on affordable water tariffs for cost recovery. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject?  \n \nThe project will benefit people currently not connected in urban and peri-urban areas and improve the quality of service to all \nusers.  \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project?  \n \nThe project will provide affordable and clean water to prospective and existing users. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem?  \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nHigh upfront connection charges often impede access to piped water supply for the urban poor. The project team will work with \nHai Phong Water Supply One Member Company and the People's Committee to overcome hurdles and ensure an affordable \ntariff structure. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders.  \n \nThe main stakeholders are water users, the water company, and the local government. \n \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)?  \n \nThere will be several public consultation meetings over the course of project preparation such as workshops and \nseminars. The project will include household surveys, focus group discussions, and hearings on resettlement and \nenvironmental issues as required.  \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nA C&P plan will be prepared by the PPTA consultant during the social assessment survey and focus group discussions to \nlearn the popular view of the project.
