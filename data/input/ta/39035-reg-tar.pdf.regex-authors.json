The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  recognizes  the  importance  of  information  and \ncommunications  technology  (ICT)  to  improve  education  and  foster  development  in  the \nAsia-Pacific region. In 2002, the ADB approved a sector policy1 encouraging innovations in ICT \nand learning technologies. This policy recommends adapting such technologies, particularly for \nimproving  access  to  and  quality  of  education  in  remote  areas  and  among  disadvantaged \ncommunities  in  the  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).  The  potential  of  new  learning \ntechnologies is stimulating DMC governments to incorporate ICT into their education and training \npolicies and strategies. The importance of partnerships with the private sector in this field is \nincreasingly recognized in the DMCs, and the private sector is keen to provide cost-efficient and \ninnovative ICT solutions to improve education and assist educational institutions to use them \nefficiently. With this in mind, ADB and the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) set up a \nseries of international conferences (2004\u20132007)2 to examine with stakeholders e-learning as a \nmeans to improve access to quality schooling throughout Asia. The proposed regional technical \nassistance (TA) will support this process by implementing policy and strategy studies to support \ndevelopment of broader ICT in education frameworks, as well as specific pilot studies on ICT and \ne-learning innovations to provide in-depth understanding of the potential and feasibility of such \ninnovations. The studies will inform international conferences that will be held in 2006 and 2007. \nThe TA will partially finance the cost of these conferences. The TA concept paper was endorsed \nby the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund  peer review in January 2005.3 Governments of \nBangladesh, Mongolia, Nepal and Samoa have approved implementation of the pilot studies in \ntheir countries under the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The approach to ICT in education and training has been based predominantly on the \nsupply and use of PCs and software, and, where feasible, linked with Internet access. This has \nnot proven to be the most cost-efficient approach in several DMCs due to (i) high costs arising \nfrom  the  start-up  arrangements  (including  upgrading  physical  infrastructure),  (ii)  often \ninappropriate selection of hardware and software and safeguards for installation and regular \nmaintenance of equipment, and (iii) extensive and often incorrectly focused in-service training of \nteachers undertaken in implementing the approach in schools and training institutions. DMCs\u2019 \nreliance on this approach alone in the past may have actually increased inequity in access to \nknowledge,  education,  and  training.  This  may  be  particularly  true  in  DMCs  where  such  a \nhigh-cost approach has proven not feasible to implement in all areas and for all groups of the \nsociety. To effectively reduce the digital divide within DMCs, appropriate ICT policy and strategic \nframeworks are needed to maximize access and flow of knowledge to a wider range of users, \nparticularly by utilizing the potential and opportunities arising from the latest developments in ICT. \nIn recent years, increased computing power combined with improved wireless and user-friendly \nsatellite technology and reduced telecommunication costs have contributed to reducing space \nand time barriers for information access and exchange. These opportunities for utilizing more \ncost-efficient and user-friendly ICT solutions in education and training, and to reach all groups of \nsociety\u2014including  the  poor,  users  in  remote  areas,  and  other  disadvantaged  groups\u2014have \nbecome increasingly feasible also in poorer DMCs.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared as Assessing Innovative e-Learning Technologies among the Poor in Asia in ADB Business \nOpportunities (internet edition) on 24 January 2005. \n ", "2   \n3.  ADB, in line with its education policy, is responding to the increasing demand in the DMCs \nfor assistance with ICT in education. To be successful, however, this effort will require support \nfrom concurrent investments into appropriate science and technology, as well as centers of \nexcellence, pursuing ICT innovations in education. These major thrusts are closely intertwined. \nWhen carefully synergized in individual DMCs, they together will provide a strong impetus for \nincreasing access to and improving quality of education through innovative teaching and learning \ntechnologies.  If  these  will  be  appropriate  for  decentralized  education  delivery  to  such \ndisadvantaged communities as those in poor and remote areas, then they can greatly contribute \nto reducing poverty in the DMCs.  \n \n4.  It is well understood that e-learning will shape the way teachers teach and students learn \nin the future. Examples include provision of e-textbooks to remote areas via the computer or \nsatellite linked to handheld devices on demand connections, and e-teacher in-service training \nusing innovative technologies that facilitate implementing decentralized teacher training strategies \nand information sharing directly to teachers in remote schools. ADB recently undertook a major \ninitial study to map out the situation in the region.4 In addition, some development partners have \nprepared useful basic data and analysis.5 However, as the situation in this field is evolving rapidly, \nthere is a need to provide data updates and undertake comprehensive studies to support policy \nand strategy development. These should include in-depth analysis of the demand for various ICT \nsolutions in education, and, in particular the intertwined educational development areas of ICT, \nscience and technology, and centers of excellence. Also needed is a comprehensive comparative \nanalysis of these intertwined areas in the region\u2019s middle- and low-income countries.  \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s possible role in financing such a holistic development approach will be important to \nexplore, as development in DMCs will depend increasingly on their abilities to produce, process, \nunderstand, use, and commercialize scientific and technological knowledge in ways appropriate \nto each DMC\u2019s culture and aspirations. While some middle-income countries have managed to \ncreate pockets of science and technology capacity that at least partially serve their economic and \nsocial ambitions, the vast majority of the DMCs have severe capacity deficits in this area. A lack \nof capacity among many DMCs to even access and utilize advances in science and technology \nhas  prevented  them  from  capturing  the  benefits  that  have  become  commonplace  in  the \ndeveloped world. Often it is the poor people in DMCs who suffer most from the lack of adequate \nservices and products. The barriers to seizing the opportunities for using science and technology \nneed to be addressed. Timely and appropriate local adoption of science and technology often \nrequires significant investment into building indigenous technological capacity.  \n \n6.  On the one hand, improving science and technology capacity in general is important for \ndevelopment.  Such  efforts  can  be  supported,  for  example,  through  increased  emphasis  on \nscience- and technology-related subjects at appropriate levels of formal education, and through \nincreased investment in research. On the other hand, it will be important to invest in science and \ntechnology  that  will  be  useful  for  developing  appropriate  ICT  for  accessing  knowledge  and \nsupporting e-learning for continuous human resources development. That is necessary if the \nDMCs are to progress toward the knowledge-based economy, improved economic growth, and \nreduced  poverty.  DMCs  need  assistance  in  preparing  appropriate  policy  and  regulatory \nframeworks to facilitate a conducive environment for ICT. In particular, they need help to develop \nappropriate ICT and e-learning applications to improve formal education in schools, colleges, and \nuniversities,  as  well  as  for  continuous  lifelong  adult  education  and  training  in  line  with  the \ndevelopment needs in various sectors of the society. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2005.

In addition to the broader policy and strategy studies, it will be necessary to undertake \nstudies of innovative ongoing pilot projects in ICT in education. In particular, these should aim to \ndisseminate educational knowledge to remote areas where the poor disproportionately reside and \nto other disadvantaged groups, and to facilitate in-depth understanding of the contribution these \ndevelopments can make in reducing the digital divide and poverty. ADB already has ICT projects \nin the education sectors in Mongolia and Samoa. Here, schoolnet6 operations include production \nof learning materials for computers used in poor communities. The schoolnet project in Samoa7 \nprovides computers in schools\u2014including Internet availability\u2014to increase access to learning \nmaterials and new technologies for teaching and learning. The project allows greater access to \nsupplementary reading references and reading materials via computer. In Mongolia, ADB is \nsupporting  ICT  for  the  Innovating  Rural  Education  in  Mongolia  Project 8 and  the  Second \nEducation Development Project.9 These projects have gained experience in applying ICT to \nimprove teaching and learning materials. E-textbook pilot innovations can be studied in these \nongoing projects in Samoa and Mongolia.  \n \n8.  Likewise, ADB has projects to improve teacher training in Bangladesh10 and Nepal.11 In \nNepal, the ADB-funded loan project supports the Government\u2019s teacher education activities, \nwhich provide in-service training and materials to primary school teachers. It will be important to \nexplore how these materials and in-service training can be improved by providing appropriate \ne-learning  access  to  schools.  The  potential  impact  of  e-learning  in  remote  disadvantaged \ncommunities can be piloted in a sample of schools from the ongoing project. A large-scale reform \nfor teacher education has recently commenced in Bangladesh with the support of an ADB-funded \nloan project. The project includes provision for teacher education through distance education \nmethods and funding for developing innovative approaches to teacher training institutions and \nschools. It is important to undertake pilot studies to assess the potential that e-teacher training \ninnovations may have in a large-scale teacher education reform. \n \n9.  The ADB/ADBI international conference in 2004 set the stage for conference agendas for \nthe following years (footnote 2). Each conference is to focus on e-learning topics and to facilitate \nexchange  of  information  among  DMCs,  experts,  the  private  sector,  and  other  stakeholders. \nMoreover,  the  conference  will  bring  these  people  together  to  propose  concept  papers  for \nincorporating into the country strategy and program (CSP) process. Participants include also \npoverty experts to offer insights on how innovative e-learning solutions can overcome the digital \ndivide between communities and contribute to reduction of poverty. Outcomes from the pilot \nstudies implemented under the TA will be reported back during the conferences in 2006 and 2007, \nwhich will focus on e-textbooks and e-teacher training, respectively.  \n \n \n                                                 \n6  Here, \u201cschoolnet\u201d is defined as a system of schools linked by a computer network such as the Internet, a local area \nnetwork, or a mail system that delivers CD-ROMs. \n7  ADB. 2003.

The outcome will be a consensus reached on the appropriate innovative ICT \nin education solutions and their applicability, replicability, and sustainability in a larger scale in \nDMC country contexts.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will have three components. The first component will include implementing studies \nto support policy and strategy development in the area of ICT in education. It will analyze and \nassess in-depth the demand in DMCs for innovative ICT in education. The focus will be on the \ncontribution the innovations can make to reducing poverty by improving the quality of education \nand access to it. Also addressed will be the feasibility and sustainability of such innovations on a \nlarger scale, and the financing needs as well as cost-sharing possibilities (including the role for \nthe private sector) in the DMCs. Special attention will be given to the roles of science and \ntechnology and centers of excellence in supporting development of feasible and sustainable ICT \ninnovations in education. Possibilities will be explored to extend the potential of ICT applications \nbeyond the conventional ICT approach to complementary or alternative innovative solutions, \nwhere necessary and feasible. The goal will be to strengthen decentralized education delivery in \norder to narrow the digital divide and reach the poorest and other disadvantaged groups. Demand, \nfeasibility and sustainability factors will be compared between middle- and low-income DMCs. \nOutputs will include reports, technical and discussion papers, CD-ROMs, DVDs, PowerPoint \ne-files, and other knowledge products, as appropriate, for use by the ADB and DMCs. The \nanalysis and outputs will be important also for the conferences (the third component of the TA). \n \n12.  The second component will include implementation of specific pilot studies in Bangladesh, \nMongolia, Nepal, and Samoa. The studies will piggyback ongoing ADB-funded projects. Key \nactivities will include linking pilot studies to ongoing projects to support trial interventions in \ne-textbook development and e-teacher training in a small sample of schools under each ongoing \nproject. Some additional software and equipment may be required to supplement or complement \nthe existing ICT arrangements in the schools participating in the pilot studies. Depending upon \nthe circumstances in each country, consultants will identify, acquire, and install the additional ICT \nequipment and software for teaching and materials, or they will adopt other appropriate ICT and \ne-learning arrangements. In consultation with the management and staff of ongoing projects and \nother stakeholders in the four DMCs, the consultants will design the pilot study interventions, \nprovide  necessary  orientation  for  teachers  and  students,  implement  the  interventions,  and \nevaluate  those  using  focused  interviews.  In  addition  to  the  use  of  e-textbooks,  additional \noff-the-shelf  software  learning  materials  (supplementary  materials,  educational  games, \nreferences etc.) will be used, as appropriate, in those schools participating in the pilot studies. \nThis will be supported with training and followed by in-depth focused interviews and comparisons \nacross schools. The pilots for e-teacher training will design, implement, and evaluate new ways of \nhelping teachers put learning into practice. The recommendations will stress micro-level solutions \nin classrooms. Outputs will include reports, technical and discussion papers, CD-ROMs, DVDs, \nPowerPoint e-files, and other knowledge products, as appropriate. The pilot studies will follow the \nschedule of the international conferences. Pilot studies on e-textbooks will be carried out in 2006 \nand findings reported to the international conference on e-textbooks to be held in the 4th quarter \nof 2006. Pilot studies on e-teacher training will be completed in 2007 and findings reported to the \ninternational conference on e-teacher training to be held in the 4th quarter of 2007. Special \nattention will be paid to possibilities for replicating innovative ICT and e-learning on a larger scale, \nas well as to gauging the practical sustainability and actual financial costs. The recommendations ", "  5\nwill be used by ADB and ADBI to mobilize Asian e-learning networks that feed into ongoing and \nfuture ADB operations in education that employ ICT. \n \n13.  The third component will support the ongoing series of international conferences on ICT in \neducation sponsored by ADB and ADBI. These funds will allow more DMC members to travel to \nthe conferences in order to learn and share ideas about e-learning innovations. The TA funds \nalso  will  fund  participation  by  experts  in  education  technology  and  poverty  reduction.  The \nconferences will support greater coordination and network building on ICT in education between \nADB,  ADBI,  DMCs,  the  private  sector,  and  other  stakeholders.  They  will  help  to  spread \nknowledge and information within the network on the latest technological innovations and their \npotential for reducing poverty by improving the quality of education and access to it. The TA will \nprovide partial support to finance the conferences. Outputs will include, for example, conference \nproceedings, DMC concept papers for e-learning projects for potential incorporation into CSPs, \nplans for further studies, and private-public partnership funding programs identified to support \ne-learning. A web page at the ADB education website will be developed to encourage and \nfacilitate continuous dialogue and debate on ICT and e-learning issues.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000. ADB will finance $800,000 equivalent. \nThe  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund, \nadministered by ADB. ADBI will provide parallel financing of $200,000 equivalent. Appendix 2 \nincludes details of cost estimates and the financing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  24  months,  commencing  in  January  2006  with \ncompletion expected in December 2007. ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The \nCapacity Development and Governance Division of the Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment  will  be  responsible  for  administration  of  the  TA.  An  advisory  group  will  guide \nimplementation of the TA. It will comprise representatives of ADB, ADBI, DMCs, experts, and the \nprivate sector participating in the international conferences organized by ADB and ADBI. The \nadvisory group will have meetings during the conferences and communicate also through video \nconferences and e-mails, as and when necessary, during the TA implementation period.  \n \n16.  The TA will utilize 53 person-months of consultancy inputs, to be provided by three \ninternational consultants (13 person-months) and eight domestic consultants (40 person-months). \nConsultants will be engaged through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The \nquality  and  cost-based  method  will  be  used  for  selecting  consultants.  The  team  leader  will \nprepare  (i)  an  inception  report,  including  a  detailed  work  plan,  within  1  month  from  TA \ncommencement; (ii) a mid-term progress report by the end of 2006; and (iii) a final report by the \nend of 2007. Procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Upon completion of the \nTA, the participating schools will retain the equipment for use in follow-up programs.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund  for  the  Innovative  Information  and \nCommunications Technology in Education, and Its Potential for Reducing Poverty in the Asia and \nPacific Region, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions \n  Targets/Indicators  Monitoring Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nAppropriate and  Decentralized approach  Regional and country  \u2022  It will be possible, \nincreased utilization  for improving the quality of  indicators of ICT use in  with supportive role \nof innovative ICT in  and access to education  education, including the  from science and \neducation in DMCs.  increasingly implemented  use in remote and poor  technology and \nin DMCs through  areas.   centers of excellence, \ninnovative ICT in  to innovate and \neducation applications,  pursue ICT and \nand that is supported by  e-learning solutions in \nappropriate policies and  education, as \nstrategies.  applicable in the \ncontext of each DMC. \nOutcome      Assumption \nConsensus reached  Comprehensive and  Study reports,  \u2022  Effective stakeholder \non the appropriate  uniform draft policies,  conference proceedings,  participation and \ninnovative ICT in  strategies, and  draft policy and strategy  ownership developed \neducation solutions  implementation plans  documents, public- to employ innovative \nand their applicability,  prepared for adoption in  private funding  ICT in education to \nreplicability, and  DMCs for innovative ICT  programs,  improve quality of \nsustainability in a  in education.   implementation plans.  education and its \nlarger scale in DMC  delivery to all, \ncountry contexts.    including remote and \npoor areas. \nRisk \n\u2022  Approval of policies, \nstrategies, and \nimplementation plans \nby DMCs is delayed. \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
