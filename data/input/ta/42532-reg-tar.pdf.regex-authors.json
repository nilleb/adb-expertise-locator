As part of the implementation plan of the Asian Development Fund (ADF) currency \nmanagement proposal, approved by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of Directors in \n2005, 1  ADB  started  offering  to  eligible  ADF  borrowers  the  option  to  convert  all  their \nmulticurrency legacy ADF debts into special drawing rights (SDR) on 1 January 2008.2 To \ninform the borrowers of the conversion option and its implications, and the conversion process, \nletters of agreements were sent at the end of December 2007, and workshops were conducted \nfor major ADF borrowers.3 \n \n2.  Borrowers\u2019 benefits from the SDR conversion include lower foreign exchange volatility, \nsimplified and streamlined currency and debt management, and harmonized financial terms \nwith  those  of  the  International  Development  Association.  It  is  also  envisaged  that  the \nconversion of all outstanding legacy ADF debts could help free up about $500 million in \nadditional resources because of a reduction in required foreign exchange provision. As of \n31 October  2008,  16  countries\u2014representing  about  57%  of  total  ADF  outstanding  debt \nbalances\u2014have agreed to the SDR conversion. \n \n3.  Discussions  with  government  officials  on  the  occasion  of  the  SDR  conversion \nworkshops indicated borrowers\u2019 interest for ADB to provide (i) additional training related to \npublic debt and risk management (PDRM), i.e., development of debt management strategy, \nportfolio management, debt management organization structure, systems, and back office \noperations; and (ii) opportunities to learn from and share experiences with officials of other \ngovernments on the challenges associated with PDRM. ADB\u2019s Treasury Department proposes \nto initiate regional capacity development technical assistance (TA)4 that addresses borrowers\u2019 \nrequests for exchange of knowledge and specific training on currency and risk management \nthrough regional and country-specific workshops. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Experience in previous financial crises, and the current one, has demonstrated the \nimportance of a prudent public debt management strategy to prevent domestic financial crisis \nand its contagious effects. In the past 15 years, many developing countries\u2014with assistance \nfrom international organizations\u2014have endeavored to establish sound public debt management \nframeworks, and improved their institutional capabilities in the process. However, many are still \nat relatively early stages of development because of various external and domestic issues. \nBased  on  discussions  with  officials  during  the  SDR  conversion  workshops,  all  countries \nindicated that there are gaps between their achievements and targets. Hence, assistance to \nbridge such gaps has been sought.  \n \n5.  The  area  that  governments  are  keen  to  strengthen,  among  others,  is  institutional \ncapacity in PDRM. It was indicated that learning through experience, by sharing with peer \ncountries and more developed economies, is the preferred approach. This TA will provide a \nforum for developing member country (DMC) government officials to learn the following from \nother debt managers: (i) different modalities, and (ii) the most appropriate approach to apply to \ntheir respective situations. The workshops and/or forums under this TA will be designed to meet \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2005. Asian Development Fund Currency Management Proposal. Manila.  \n2   ADB. 2007. Special Drawing Rights Conversion Option for Legacy Asian Development Fund Loans. Manila. \n3   SDR conversion workshops were organized in 15 countries from September 2007 to October 2008. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 December 2008. ", "2   \nborrowers\u2019 common interests on PDRM and specific requirements to address current challenges \nat the time of program formulation. \n \n6.  On  the  debt  portfolio  aspect,  emerging  markets  generally  borrow  largely  in  foreign \ncurrencies because of lower interest rates and limited availability of local currency funding in \ndomestic capital markets. Since their assets are principally in local currencies, borrowers are \nexposed to currency mismatches and exchange rate volatility. In addition, because many of \ntheir liabilities have floating interest rates, interest rate volatility is also higher. In this regard, \nsolid  capability  in  cash  management  and  ability  to  hedge  currency  exposure  would  help \nborrowers  mitigate  adverse  financial  effects  associated  with  foreign  currency  and  floating \ninterest rate debt. In the case of ADF, exposures are mainly on currency risk as borrowers\u2019 \nliabilities are in SDR and/or multicurrencies. However, many borrowers have neither access to \nthe derivatives market to undertake hedging transactions given their credit ratings, nor the \nappropriate tools and/or capability to analyze the financial implications of their exposures and \nalternatives.  \n \n7.  Borrowers with more established domestic government bond markets could borrow in \nboth local and foreign currencies. As such, these borrowers would like access to analysis tools \nthat not only include functions for cost\u2013risk review but also the ability to explore options to \nstructure debt portfolios by using different combinations of (i) funding sources (domestic versus \nforeign currency debts), (ii) currency mixes, and (iii) interest rate bases (floating versus fixed).  \n \n8.  In this regard, the TA will provide borrowers with the analysis tools to formulate portfolio \noptimization  and  assess  the  impact  of  different  financial  scenarios,  based  on  users\u2019  own \nassumptions and exposures. Such analysis tools may be developed specifically for this TA. The \nTA may also use the medium-term debt strategy tool kit jointly developed by the International \nMonetary Fund and the World Bank. Optional users\u2019 training will be provided during workshops \nupon request by borrowers.  \n \n9.  In  addition,  ADB  will  share  its  experience  and  knowledge  on  debt  and  currency \nmanagement  with  borrowers,  and  collect  feedback  regarding  client  needs  for  other  debt \nmanagement products. This would help ADB further enhance its future financial products and \nstrengthen its relevance in Asia and the Pacific.  \n10.  The undertaking of the proposed TA is in line with the third and fourth core areas of \noperations  of  the  regional  cooperation  and  integration  and  financial  sector  development \nindicated  in  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020).5 This  effort \nrepresents an additional resource dedicated for capacity development on PDRM in Asia and the \nPacific. Cooperation in this field, between ADB and relevant international organizations, will be \nsought as appropriate. The activities are expected to complement country-specific initiatives and \nprograms being provided by ADB\u2019s regional departments; and the TA being developed by \nADB\u2019s Strategy and Policy Department6 and other relevant institutions such as the World Bank, \nInternational  Monetary  Fund,  Commonwealth  Secretariat,  Crown  Agent  for  Overseas \nGovernments and Administrations, and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n6   ADB\u2019s Strategy and Policy Department, with assistance from the World Bank, is in the process of developing a TA \nproject to organize regional workshops for ADF borrowers, with emphasis on debt sustainability assessment and \nperformance-based allocation. \n ", "  3\n11.  For  more  detailed  assessments  or  country-specific  TA  to  enhance  existing  debt \nmanagement frameworks or regulatory reforms, the Treasury Department will collaborate and \nrefer such requirements to the regional departments. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n 12.  The overall goal of the TA is to promote a PDRM network among DMC government \nofficials, which would enable cooperation and information sharing. Forums and workshops on \nspecific PDRM techniques will be organized to provide a venue for target DMC government \nofficials to share their experiences, and help strengthen DMCs\u2019 knowledge and understanding of \nbest-practice public debt management framework and techniques with emphasis on currency \nand risk management.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  This TA will include (i) a survey of borrowers\u2019 existing public debt management systems \nand challenges, (ii) three regional forums, and (iii) up to 10 country-specific workshops. These \nactivities will be a platform for government officials to enhance knowledge and share information \nrelated to PDRM. Discussion topics include, among others: \n(i)  strategic debt allocation methodology using different techniques, such as debt \nportfolio optimization and risk and cost analysis; \n(ii)  different  modalities  of  debt  management  office  organization  structure  and \ndecision-making processes, with emphasis on currency and risk management; \n(iii)  hedging strategies and techniques;  \n(iv)  diagnosis of weaknesses and constraints of existing processes; and \n(v)  building  blocks  and  steps  required  to  develop  and/or  enhance  public  debt \nmanagement strategies, particularly currency and risk management, based on \nbest practices. \n \n14.  The forum and/or workshop will be offered to ADF borrowers which have outstanding \nbalances as of 31 December 2007 and have no arrears in debt service payments. These \ninclude DMCs in Central and West Asia, East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the \nPacific. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost an equivalent of $650,000. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Detailed cost estimates and financing plans are in \nAppendix 2.7  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the TA\u2019s Executing Agency, and the Treasury Department will administer the \nTA and supervise the work of the TA consultants. The TA will be implemented in consultation \nwith the regional departments (governance and finance divisions) and the Strategy and Policy \nDepartment (Office of the Director General). Disbursements under the TA will be done in \n                                                 \n7   Any activity in a member country would commence after ADB receives in writing the no-objection to its inclusion in \nthe TA. \n ", "4   \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n17.  Two individual international consultants\u2014public debt specialist (3 person-months) and \ndebt portfolio analysis tool development specialist (4 person-months)\u2014will be engaged for a \ntotal of 7 person-months. For each forum, one national consultant will be hired for a maximum of \n2 months to assist in the coordination and logistical arrangements. The quality-based selection \nbasis  will  be  adopted.  Various  experts  from  the  academe,  government  agencies,  and \ninternational organizations will be engaged as resource speakers. The terms of reference for \nconsultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  as  individual \nconsultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 36 months. It is expected to commence in \nJanuary 2009, and be completed by December 2011. It will include three regional forums for up \nto 29 ADF borrowers. Each country could nominate up to two participants per forum. Each \nforum will be held for 2\u20133 days. Forum venues will be decided based on logistical and cost \nconsiderations. The primary participants will consist of those nominated by target DMCs from \ndebt management offices, ministries of finance, central banks, and other relevant agencies \nresponsible for public debt management.  \n \n19.  Country-specific workshops (up to 10 countries, for 2 days each) on the use of analysis \ntools and hedging techniques may be designed and organized for certain DMCs on a request \nbasis. \n \nIV.
