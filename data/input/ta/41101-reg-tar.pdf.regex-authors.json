The  2007  technical  assistance  (TA)  program  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department (RSDD) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) includes a regional \ntechnical  assistance  (RETA)  project  to  undertake  analytical  work  on  issues  related  to  the \nmanagement of cities and to support sustainable urban development in Asia.1 Knowledge in this \narea will support the provision of urban infrastructure, which is a high priority under the Medium-\nTerm Strategy II and an important issue for developing member countries (DMCs). Thus, this \nRETA project responds to both the demands of DMCs and the operational needs of ADB. The \nRETA project's design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n2.  Urban economies play a central role in Asia\u2019s economic growth and development. Cities \nand towns are home to a majority of the region\u2019s population and account for most of its gross \ndomestic product GDP, job creation, and government revenues. Cities also play host to millions \nof the region\u2019s poor, whose well being and contribution to the economy depend on effective \nurban planning and access to affordable infrastructure services. Well-managed cities act as \nengines of economic growth, bind national economies with the world economy, and become \nsymbols of national pride. When conditions in urban areas are poor, cities become bottlenecks to \ngrowth, hindering regional and global economic integration and frustrating efforts to reduce \npoverty. Many urban areas also play key service-center roles in the national economy and \nsupport rural poverty reduction. \n3.  Urbanization in Asia is a multifaceted and complex process, the scale of which is striking: \n44 million people are added to city populations every year, equivalent to 120,000 people each \nday. Thus, each day, the construction of more than 20,000 new dwellings, 250 kilometers of new \nroads,  and  additional  infrastructure  to  supply  more  than  6  megaliters  of  potable  water  is \n2\nrequired.  For ADB to be relevant to the needs of its DMCs, it needs to work on operations that \nmaximize opportunities for urbanization while also addressing the potential negative impacts of \nurbanization. Institutions that manage urbanization often lack coordination, capacity, and finance. \nAddressing  global  environmental  problems  and  achieving  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDGs) is most difficult in Asia\u2019s urban areas. \n4.  Furthermore, the investment needs of Asia\u2019s urban areas are great. The public sector \ncannot meet them alone. A closer partnership between public and private sectors is essential. \nBetter engagement with urban sector institutions in both the public and private sectors is a high \npriority. ADB estimates that $60 billion in investment per annum will be needed to meet the \ndemand for urban infrastructure services between 2007 and 2010. This includes water supply, \nsanitation, solid waste management, slum upgrading, urban roads, and mass transit systems. \nThere is a huge funding gap, and ADB can play a key role in helping to finance this need. In \naddition  to  narrowing  the  funding  gap,  ADB  can  support  the  development  of  critical  urban \nmanagement policies and systems and help DMCs overcome skills shortfalls. \n5.  Concerns about the social and environmental impact of urban development are also \ngrowing. Under-serviced urban growth often leads to declining environmental quality, congestion, \nand pollution. This is detrimental to the quality of life for residents, even as incomes rise. About \n70% of the world\u2019s poor live in Asia. Urban poverty has reached levels of 60% in some cities, \nand continues to increase, affecting some 800 million people. Nearly one-third of urban poor do \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 26 July 2007. \n2   Kanaley, Trevor, and Brian Roberts, eds. 2006. Urbanization and Sustainability; Case Studies of Good Practices. \nManila: ADB. \n ", "2   \nnot have access to safe water, and half lack access to adequate sanitation. About the same \nnumber live in environmentally dangerous areas and/or slums, without any security of tenure. \nHigh levels of environmental stress compound poverty. The economic impact of pollution in \nAsian urban areas in terms of loss of productivity and health-care costs is estimated to be \nequivalent to 1\u20135% of GDP. \n6.  ADB's  urban  lending  to  date  amounts  to  more  than  $11  billion,  mostly  focused  on \ninfrastructure. Lending has predominantly gone to projects involving water supply and sanitation \nand \u201cmultisector\u201d interventions covering sanitation, solid waste, and slum upgrading. The quality \nof ADB\u2019s investments in the urban sector has by and large been rated effective and relevant.3 \nThe challenge for ADB now is to build on and boost the impact of the individual projects that \nembody  the  principles  set  out  in  the  Urban  Sector  Strategy.4  Upscaling  activities  and/or \npartnering with other agencies are two ways to broaden the impact of such projects. \n7.  In  this  context,  urban  development  is  increasingly  difficult  for  many  governments  to \nmanage. In many countries, ADB has had difficulty helping governments improve urban services. \nIn addition, there is increasing capacity and willingness on the part of national and local private \nsectors to participate in the delivery of urban services. ADB recognizes these strategic shifts and \nis planning to increase both the quantity and quality of its urban lending by leveraging and \nconsolidating cofinancing under longer-term programmatic interventions, bolstering urban sector \nknowledge,  improving  the  quality  of  sector  analysis,  and  supporting  urban  networking  and \noutreach.  ADB\u2019s  urban  action  plan  implemented  through  the  Urban  Community  of  Practice \n(CoP)5 will focus on actions that will mobilize resources and provide the organizational structure \nfor this through the proposed Urban Infrastructure Financing Partnership Facility (UIFPF).  \n8.  This RETA project will address a number of issues for ADB in this context. The issues \nare: (i) ADB's decreasing ability to respond to some of its clients in the urban sector (given \nstrategic shifts, the increasingly prominent role of the private sector, and the need to leverage \nand consolidate cofinancing under longer-term programmatic interventions); (ii) a lack of sector \ndepth  and  a  loss  of  ability  to  generate  strategic  sector  analysis  and  diagnostics  in  some \ncountries;  and  (iii)  a  lack  of  internal  infrastructure  to  support  networking  among  urban \nprofessionals and outreach to clients. \n9.  ADB can play a leading role in supporting Asian cities by bolstering urban lending. As a \nfinancier, ADB can help deliver much-needed investment in infrastructure services, particularly \nthrough  the  innovation  and  efficiency  initiative6  and  other  approaches.  As  a  development \ninstitution  with  extensive  experience  in  urban  planning,  infrastructure  services  reform,  and \npoverty reduction, ADB is well placed to deliver knowledge products and finance for sustainable \nand inclusive development of the region\u2019s cities and towns. Additionally, ADB can act as a strong \npartner in policy dialogue, work at multiple levels of government, and foster partnerships with the \nprivate sector and bilateral donors. \n10.  More analytical work is required to improve ADB\u2019s knowledge of constraints to providing \nurban infrastructure support on a sustainable basis, and of effective approaches to addressing \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2006.

Key areas of focus are: (i) maximizing the economic efficiency of urban \nareas, (ii) reducing urban poverty, (iii) improving quality of life, and (iv) achieving more sustainable forms of urban \ndevelopment. \n5  The Community of Practice is the network of all urban sector officers in the ADB and is guided by a Committee \nwhich is comprised of representatives of the community, and which will oversight the use of RETA resources. \n6  ADB. 2005. Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities. Manila. The key instruments are: (i) the multitranche \nfinancing facility, (ii) subsovereign lending, (iii) local currency lending, and (iv) refinancing. \n ", "        3\n       \n       \nthose constraints. Furthermore, this work will support ADB\u2019s Urban CoP to move the urban \nsector  agenda  forward  in  operations  departments  (ODs)7.  In  the  context  of  new  financing \nmodalities and instruments, this work will also facilitate ADB's efforts to identify new areas of \noperational support and business development. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  ADB\u2019s response to these needs has been to institute a number of activities, including this \nRETA project. Initially, the Managing the Cities in Asia RETA8 project proposed the following \nresponses to the issues raised in the Special Evaluation Study on Urban Sector Strategy and \nOperations (footnote 3): (i) more effective support of ADB\u2019s urban operations and the CoP, and \n(ii) more effective partnerships. The present RETA project addresses the former; a subsequent \nRETA9 project will support partnerships. \n12.  The RETA will contribute to the improved management of cities of all sizes in DMCs by \ndeveloping  new  implementation  mechanisms\u2014i.e.,  new  forms  of  project  formulation  and \nadministration\u2014and  boosting  support  for  ODs\u2019  urban  sector  operations.  It  will  undertake \npreparatory activities for, and initial implementation activities of, urban sector initiatives that are \nnot within ODs normal scope of work. The TA will also improve ADB\u2019s partnership with related \nexperts  and  institutions  in  the  region,  and  will  demonstrate  ADB\u2019s  character  as  a  regional \nknowledge organization in the sector. A knowledge management system accessible to both ADB \nstaff and external parties will be established to disseminate the RETA project's findings. A \nsecond RETA project will be formulated to provide further support for ADB\u2019s urban operations \nbased on the recommendations of the present RETA. These recommendations will focus on \nimprovements in business lines and implementation mechanisms, and include an assessment of \nthe need for additional resources to support such improvements. \n13.  The outcomes of the RETA will be: (i) improved operational knowledge and management \nof cities in Asia; and (ii) improved ADB policy dialogue and responsiveness to the demands of \nDMC urban managers. Such knowledge and dialogue will assist ADB in defining the focus areas \nand procedures for operations of the UIFPF. In addition, the RETA will support the CoP in \nstrengthening knowledge and management of ADB staff in the sector. \n14.  The main activities of the RETA are: (i) operational support for project and program \npreparation\u2014in particular programs that incorporate important donor partnerships, significant \npublic\u2013private partnerships, and/or links to other initiatives such as the carbon market initiative; \n(ii) support for improving ADB\u2019s policy dialogue, relevance to DMCs, and responsiveness to \nDMCs; and (iii) support for the knowledge development and networking activities of the CoP. The \nactivities chosen will be selected with a view to: developing  models for improved approaches to \nthe implementation of urban projects and the innovation and efficiency initiative; documenting \nimportant lessons learned (footnote 5); and bolstering sector knowledge in these areas. The \nRETA will also support the coordination of activities with other donors under the UIFPF through \nsuch mechanisms as Cities Development Initiative for Asia (CDIA). \n \n15.  The TA project will target ODs. It will be demand-driven and supportive of urban sector \noperations, and will seek to enable ODs to effectively and promptly respond to clients\u2019 requests. \n                                                 \n7  ADB\u2019s regional departments and the Private Sector Operations Department. \n8  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for Managing the Cities in Asia. Manila (TA 6293-REG, approved on 19 \nDecember). \n9  Proposed RETA for the Cities Development Initiative for Asia currently under preparation. \n ", "4   \nThe TA project will aim to minimize application processes both for the proposals processed \nunder the RETA, and for the UIFPF. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The three sets of activities set out in para. 14 above define the three components of the \nRETA set out below. These activities will take place in countries to be selected by ODs.10\n17.  Strategic Support for Operations. Under the RETA, RSDD will make a pool of funds \navailable and manage the delivery of TA to the ODs in two key areas. \n \n(i)  Sector diagnostics, analysis, and strategies. Formulating Country-Level Sector \nAssessments, Road Maps, and Investment Plans. The CoP will be responsible for \nselecting projects from proposals put forward by ODs. Such activities will also \ndetermine, based on analysis of operational examples of urban infrastructure \nprojects, the most effective ways of delivering such support. \n \n(ii)  Project preparation support: promoting innovation and efficiency.  Expertise \nwill be made available to finance specialized consultants to (i) introduce and \nstructure private sector participation/public\u2013private partnerships in urban sector \nprojects;  (ii)  facilitate  sector-wide  approaches  and  manage  the  required\u2014and \noften extensive\u2014up-front donor coordination (who is doing what, where are the \ngaps, etc.); and (iii) support other innovations (for instance, helping to identify up-\nfront  financing  gaps  for  the  carbon  market  initiative).  The  RETA  project  will \nexamine ways of efficiently leveraging cofinancing for such activities through such \nmechanisms as CDIA.  \n18.  Support for Community of Practice: Sharing Sector Knowledge. Beyond the direct \noperational  support  outlined  above,  the  RETA  will  also  support  the  development  and \ndissemination of ADB\u2019s knowledge products. These will be defined by the CoP and will include \n(i) target research to identify new business lines in waste management, urban transport, city \n\u201cclusters\u201d development, and municipal finance; (ii) thematic and technical training and study \ntours for clients and staff (cofinanced, but managed by RSDD, based around a catalogue of \noptions,  perhaps  with  private  sector  and/or  commercial  liaison  office  involvement); \n(iii) evaluation, documentation, and monitoring of results and lessons learned from projects, and \nsharing those results with ODs; and (iv) conducting a series of CoP-sponsored seminars (brown \nbags)  where  external  experts  can  share  their  knowledge  with  ADB  urban  staff.    Through \nnetworking arrangements such as CDIA, and through selected workshops and conferences (not \nnecessarily funded under the RETA project), ADB will disseminate its knowledge products and \nexpertise in the urban sector. \n19.  Developing  Sector  Expertise.  The  RETA  will  also  support  basic  CoP  operations, \nincluding  (i)  the  development  and  management  of  the  urban  development  intranet  site \nmaintained by RSDD including standard terms of reference (TORs) and identifying consultants; \nand (ii) selected CoP activities, including operations department staff participation at (selected) \nworkshops and conferences. \n20.  The long-term outcome will be to increase ADB finance in the urban sector and improve \nknowledge of best practices both for ADB staff and for our DMC clients. The RETA will also \ncomplement ongoing initiatives, such as the Water Financing Program and Energy Efficiency \n                                                 \n10  As yet no countries have been selected for country specific activities, but ADB will obtain government \u201cno-objection\u201d \nprior to undertaking activities in a country. \n ", "        5\n       \n       \n. This will lead to greater efficiency of urban service delivery. ADB assessments11 \nindicate that there is scope to at least double ADB urban sector lending by 2015. It is projected \nthat such an increase in investment would lead to improved services for 200 million people\u2014\nover half of whom are poor. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n21.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $800,000. The TA project will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA cost estimate and financing plan is shown in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  RETA,  with  ADB\u2019s  RSDD  as  the  nodal \ndepartment for its implementation. RSDD will undertake the RETA activities in collaboration with \nother relevant departments. The RETA implementation team will comprise a team leader from \nRSDD and one staff person from each operations department. Implementation will be supported \nby international and national consultants recruited on an individual basis.  \n \n23.  Implementing the RETA will require about 20 person-months of international individual \nconsultants, including urban and infrastructure experts in energy; transport; water supply and \nsanitation;  environment;  and  municipal  management,  finance  and  urban  economics. \nImplementation  will  also  require  about  50  person-months  of  individual  national  consultants \nsupport  research  and  data  analysis.  The  consultants  will  undertake  technical  studies  and \nspecialized analytical inputs, as required by the priority activities identified by the task force. \nField studies will be undertaken on a selective basis. Outline TORs are set in Appendix 3. The \nengagement periods of the various consultants will be refined and finalized in response to \noperations department requests, and agreed upon by the task force during implementation of the \nRETA project. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n24.  The RETA implementation team will collaborate closely and regularly consult with the \nUrban  CoP.  As  appropriate,  the  team  will  organize  focused  discussions,  workshops,  and \nseminars. The RETA will provide assistance to ODs which is demand-driven, supporting their \nurban operations by providing resources in a highly responsive and timely manner. The RETA \nproject will design ways in which such responses can be sustained and piloted in the follow-up \nRETA  project.  The  outputs  of  this  analytical  work  will  be  compiled  as  a  useful  knowledge \nproduct. The findings of this analytical work will be widely disseminated through publications, \nseminars, workshops, conferences, and other means. ADB staff members will support the TA \nproject  as  resource  persons  in  workshops  where  appropriate.  The  RETA  project  will  be \nimplemented over 11 months, starting in February 2008 and ending in December 2008. The \nRETA outcome will be evaluated with a view toward contributing to ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with \nDMCs, increasing demand for ADB assistance, and improving the management of cities in \nDMCs in Asia. This evaluation will form the basis of the design of phase II of the RETA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis for \nSustainable Urban Development in Asia, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2006.

General \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) project will require inputs from international and national \nconsultants drawn from a range of experts, institutions, and organizations. The consultants will \ninclude urban and infrastructure experts in the areas of planning; energy; transport; water supply \nand sanitation; environment; municipal management; urban finance; and urban economics. The \nnational consultants will provide technical and research assistance support for the TA project \nimplementation team and should have strong backgrounds and experience in data collection and \nanalysis, and practice in the above areas. A small secretariat will manage the TA project and \nrespond to requests by the operations departments (ODs)1. Other consultants will be engaged on \nshort-term assignments as required by operations departments. The detailed terms of reference for \nthe consultants and their engagement periods will be finalized based on requests of operations \ndepartments in consultation with the managing task force during implementation of the TA project. \n \nB.  Consultants \n \n1.  Urban and Infrastructure Consultants (international, 20 person-months) \n \n2.
