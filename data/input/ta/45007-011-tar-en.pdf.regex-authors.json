THE ONGOING PROJECT \n \n1.  On  December  2013,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  multitranche \nfinancing  facility  (MFF)  for  the  Ulaanbaatar  Urban  Services  and  Ger  Areas  Development \nInvestment Program, comprising three tranches and with implementation period of 9 years, from \nDecember 2013 to December 2022.1 The MFF program's impact is improved living conditions in \nUlaanbaatar; and its intended outcome is a network of livable, competitive, and inclusive subcenters \nin Ulaanbaatar's ger areas, which is being achieved through four outputs: (i) roads and urban \nservices are expanded within priority subcenters and connectivity between them is improved; \n(ii) economic and public services in targeted areas are improved; (iii) service providers become \nmore efficient; and (iv) institutions and capacity for urban development, program management, and \nservice delivery are strengthened. The program's framework financing agreement was signed on \n9 December 2013 and ratified by the Mongolian Parliament on 23 May 2014. \n \n2.  The summary financing plan of the program is in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Summary Financing Plan of the Multitranche Financing Facility \nFund Source  Tranche 1  Tranche 2  Tranche 3  Total \n($ million)  ($ million)  ($ million)  ($ million) \nADB         \n       Concessional OCR Loan  22.50  29.24  4.26  56.00 \n  OCR Loan  27.50  37.11  39.39  104.00 \n  UEIF/UFPF Granta  3.70  0.00  0.00  3.70 \n  Subtotal (ADB)  53.70  66.35  43.65  163.70 \nMUB  22.44  35.15  38.41  96.00 \nEIB  28.38  19.64  12.28  60.30 \nTotal  104.52  121.14  94.34  320.00 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EIB = European Investment Bank, MUB = Municipality of Ulaanbaatar, OCR = \nordinary capital resources, UEIF/UFPF = Urban Environmental Infrastructure Fund under the Urban Financing \nPartnership Facility. \na  Financing partner: the Government of Sweden.

Tranche 1 of the MFF program was approved on 17 December 2013 and became effective \non  24  September  2014,  with  revised  completion  date  of  31 December  2019.  Tranche  1 \nimplementation is progressing satisfactorily. Its cumulative contract awards as of 25 April 2019 is \n$41.32 million (76.95%) with cumulative disbursements of $18.38 million (34.23%). Tranche 2 \nwas approved on 31 March 2017 and became effective on 14 March 2018, with expected \ncompletion date of 28 February 2022. A plant contract and two consulting services contracts have \nbeen awarded under Tranche 2 amounting to $12.67 million (19.09%). No disbursements have \nbeen made to date pending the program management office's (PMO) opening of the advance \naccount for this tranche. Processing of Tranche 3 has started and the approval is targeted for \n2020. \n \n4.  To support the implementation of the MFF program, two technical assistance projects \nwere approved by ADB: \n(i)  Ulaanbaatar Pro-Poor Urban Redevelopment Support System for Ger Areas.2 \nThis transaction technical assistance (TRTA), for $500,000, is piloting information \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nand  communication  technology  (ICT)  tools  for  ger  area  redevelopment  in \nenhancing municipality-level urban and redevelopment planning with mapping and \nmonitoring indicators, supporting inclusive community engagement and access to \neconomic opportunities in ger areas, and strengthening redevelopment monitoring \nand coordination capacity; and \n(ii)  Livelihood Support Demonstration in Ger Areas. This small-scale technical \nassistance (SSTA), for $125,000, is being implemented to support the poor and \nvulnerable households adversely affected by involuntary resettlement in the design \nand  implementation  of  pilot  livelihood  demonstration  programs  by  enhancing \nemployable skills, training and business development, creating home-based jobs, \nand increasing opportunities for job placements, under Tranche 1 of the MFF \nprogram.3 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n5.  About 840,000 of the 1.4 million population of Ulaanbaatar City live in ger (traditional \nmoveable dwelling) areas. The urban poor and most vulnerable people live in ger areas. From \n2014 to 2016, the poverty rate in Mongolia's urban areas increased from 18.8% to 29.6 %. The \nurban poor in the ger area communities have limited access to basic services and face economic \nhardships due to lack of investments that prevents any improvement of their standards of living. \nGer areas have high levels of air, water, and soil pollution and are also vulnerable to climate \nchange  and  natural  disasters.    As  ger  areas  continue  to  grow  and  densify  due  to  urban \ndevelopment and immigration, inadequacy of basic infrastructure services, public space, and \ncommercial services has become more serious. Modernization of ger areas is the main urban, \nsocial, and environmental challenge of Mongolia.  \n \n6.  Many initiatives, pilots, and projects have been implemented to redevelop and modernize \nger areas through construction of basic infrastructure, communal facilities, and affordable housing. \nThe involuntary resettlement impacts triggered by these ger area redevelopment initiatives would \nincrease poverty and vulnerability of affected households, if such initiatives are not accompanied \nby livelihood support opportunities. Most of the future investments in ger areas are expected from \nthe government and the private sector. Both the government and the private sector are still not \nwell aware of best practices in resettlement. Therefore, it is necessary to urgently ensure that \nresettlement processes associated with redevelopment of ger areas follow resettlement best \npractices for the benefit of the affected people.  \n \n7.  The proposed TRTA will provide capacity development support to the Municipality of \nUlaanbaatar (MUB) to institutionalize an approach to plan, design, and implement livelihood \nsupport programs that target affected households whose livelihoods were adversely affected by \ninvoluntary resettlement.4 It is expected to (i) strengthen project implementation procedures and \napproaches  in  managing  involuntary  resettlement  and  livelihood  impacts  of  development \ninterventions in ger areas, and (ii) build the capacity of MUB in the management of involuntary \nresettlement and livelihood restoration programs. It will also scale-up the pilot activities conducted \n                                                \n3  A livelihood support plan for each of the two subcenters (Bayankhoshuu and Selbe) is being implemented under the \nSSTA and includes the following livelihood support measures to the poor and vulnerable affected households: \n(i) vocational skills and capacity development training; (ii) home-based business development support, through \nbusiness facilitation and equipment supply; and (iii) support in creating long-term employment opportunities. \n4  For purposes of the proposed TRTA, affected households refer to households whose livelihoods have been adversely \naffected by involuntary resettlement activities under the MFF program. \n ", "3 \nunder the SSTA (para. 4) by including affected households whose livelihoods are impacted under \nthe MFF program and will build on experiences and lessons from the implementation of the SSTA \nand the involuntary resettlement process under Tranche 1, including recent resettlement activities \nof other donors and organizations. \n \n8.  Although the TRTA is not included in the approved country operations business plan for \nMongolia, 2019\u20132021, it is in accordance with the (i) ADB's country partnership strategy for \nMongolia, 2017\u201320205 on supporting urban operations; (ii) Government Action Plan, 2016\u20132020, \nwhich  proposes  to  upgrade  existing  norms  and  standards  in  conformity  with  international \nstandards and create an environment suitable to apply international norms and standardization \ndocuments;  and  (iii)  ongoing  engagement  with  CSOs  and  community  representatives  in \nMongolia.6   \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Livelihood restoration and support programs for affected households \nimplemented.  The  TRTA  will  design  and  implement  livelihood  improvement  and  support \nprograms  together  with  MUB.  The  TRTA  team  at  inception  stage  will  (i)  analyze  the \nsocioeconomic survey findings in the ger areas; (ii) conduct a needs assessment of affected \nhouseholds;7 (iii) review the implementation of the SSTA activities to identify successful pilot \nlivelihood support programs; (iv) review ICT tools and systems that have been developed to \nenhance  business  and  investment  support  services  in  the  ger  areas;  and  (v)  carry  out \nconsultations with businesses in ger areas and organizations working on research and capacity \nbuilding related to livelihoods and productivity of micro-small medium enterprises in Mongolia, \nincluding the Asian Productivity Organization,  to identify any existing barriers that limit the \nproductivity and growth of ger-based and ger-managed enterprises. The needs assessment of \naffected households will include collection of gender disaggregated information and help identify \ndifferentiated livelihood impacts of the project on men and women. These inputs will be used for \ndevelopment and prioritization of potential livelihood support activities in consultation with the \naffected persons and other stakeholders. The livelihood support will enhance employability \nthrough skills development, provide training on business development, improve financial literacy, \nprovide tools and equipment for the affected households,8 and widen access to credit sources, \nand increase opportunities for job placements.  \n \n10.  The design and implementation of livelihood interventions will be (i) responsive to the \nspecific needs of each household and attuned to its level of preparedness; (ii) geared towards \nself-determination and empowerment rather than dependence; and (iii) gender-sensitive and \nenvironmentally sound. The TRTA will explore avenues to engage CSOs and community groups \nin planning, designing, implementing, and monitoring involuntary resettlement programs to build \ntheir capacity, ownership, and empowerment; and facilitate their involvement to benefit from \ninfrastructure projects. \n \n11.  In addition, the TRTA will (i) identify opportunities to incorporate livelihood support function \nwithin the business incubator facility built under the MFF program, Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr \nInternationale Zusammenarbeit's (GIZ) \"Build for Skills Program\" initiative under Tranche 1, and \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2017.

To continuously assess the impacts of the livelihood support activities \nunder this TRTA, a concurrent monitoring and evaluation of the TRTA activities will be carried out \nto (i) identify any red flags and corrective actions in the implementation of the TRTA objectives, \nand (ii) help contribute to the sustainability of the TRTA activities in future ger area redevelopment \nprojects in Mongolia.  \n \n12.  Output 2: A sustainable model on integrating livelihood support to persons affected \nby urban resettlement planning in Mongolia established. The experiences gained from the \nimplementation of Output 1 of the TRTA and the two technical assistance projects (para. 4) will \nprovide inputs to the development of a sustainable model that will integrate livelihood support to \npersons affected by redevelopment and urban resettlement in the ger areas. The model will be \naligned with any existing policy or strategies of the Government of Mongolia on enterprise \ndevelopment and productivity improvement. The model will guide MUB, relevant government \nagencies, CSOs, private sector, and other donors engaged in infrastructure development in \nUlaanbaatar to integrate and address livelihood restoration. It will also provide suggestions on \nhow to improve urban resettlement planning and implementation. The TRTA is expected to have \ndemonstrable benefits that can be replicated and developed into sustainable livelihood restoration \nprograms. A knowledge product in the form of a policy paper will be produced, incorporating the \nresults from consultations with stakeholder groups and affected communities.  \n \n13.  Output 3: The capacity of the Municipality of Ulaanbaatar to develop and implement \nlivelihood support programs strengthened. Capacity building under the proposed TRTA will \naim at (i) developing skills and knowledge of the Land Agency and PMO staff under MUB on \npolicy  advice  and  knowledge  management  dissemination  of  best  practices  in  involuntary \nresettlement and livelihood restoration; and (ii) institutionalizing resettlement and social safeguard \nbest practices at MUB, to benefit future urban development and infrastructure programs in \nMongolia. Capacity building initiatives will focus on concepts of and approaches to livelihood \nimprovement of affected persons and implementation of programs through external service \nproviders, including training institutes, individual experts, private companies, and NGOs. Training \nmanuals will be produced and translated into local languages, and training e-modules will be \ndeveloped for MUB staff to carry out training on livelihood improvement. The training modules will \ninclude  gender-specific  approaches  tailored  to  the  livelihood  improvement  and  skills \nenhancement needs of women. About 25 MUB staff from the Land Agency and PMO, of which at \nleast 30% will be women, will be trained on implementation of ADB involuntary resettlement \nsafeguards apart from planning and implementation of livelihood restoration programs.  \n \n14.  Design and monitoring framework. The capacity development support to be provided \nby the proposed TRTA will not result to a change in the design and monitoring framework of the \nongoing MFF program and its tranches. The TRTA will enhance the quality of outputs without any \nchange to the targeted results indicators. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TRTA is estimated to cost $720,000, of which $660,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 1. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, \noffice accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance including translators, and other in-\nkind contributions.  \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB  will  administer  the  TRTA;  and  will  select,  evaluate,  appoint,  and  supervise \nconsultants. The executing agency will be MUB supported by the PMO administering the MFF \nprogram.
