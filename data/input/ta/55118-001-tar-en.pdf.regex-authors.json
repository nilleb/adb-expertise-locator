INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) facilitates the development \nof a regional cooperation approach to unleash the economic potential of the South Caucasus \nregion\u2014comprising Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia\u2014by reopening gateways following the \n2020 Armenia\u2013Azerbaijan ceasefire.1 The South Caucasus Regional Cooperation Approach \n(SCRCA) will assess the benefits of economic cooperation within and beyond the region, amidst \npolitical uncertainties. The approach will provide options to identify and optimize international and \ndomestic gateways and provide a roadmap for the region to regain its historical significance in \ntrade and transit. Historical transport routes have been blocked because of divided land and \nclosed border crossing points resulting in high costs for trade and reducing the competitiveness \nof the region\u2019s exports.2 New gateways can yield considerable economic benefits for the region \nand hence support the political peacebuilding process.  \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB),3 as \nwell as with the Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration 2019\u20132024.4 The TA5 \nis also aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategies for Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia.6  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The South Caucasus region can serve as a transport hub between Asia and Europe, but \ncooperation between the countries is a precondition for realizing this potential. South Caucasus \ngateways compete with other transport routes and only the fastest and least expensive routes will \nattract significant transport flows. All three countries have made considerable efforts to improve \nsoft and hard trade infrastructure\u2014including investments to reduce travel time and facilitate \ntrade\u2014and to align with international integration initiatives. However, the region would benefit \nfrom improved connections. Armenia could benefit from reopened road and rail connections from \nits  southern  territories  to  Yerevan  and  Iran,  through  Azerbaijan\u2019s  exclave  Nakhichevan. \nAzerbaijan would benefit from direct road or rail connections to Nakhichevan\u2014through southern \nArmenia\u2014and further to Turkey and Iran. Open transport gateways could improve the region\u2019s \ntourism potential. \n \n4.  The  SCRCA  will  leverage  the  region\u2019s  investments,  trade  facilitation  efforts,  and \ninterregional  transport  gateways  to  provide  trade,  transit,  and  value-added  manufacturing \ndevelopment for Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. The approach will be sensitive to political \nrealities, consider the status of existing transport infrastructure, help maximize benefits from trade \nagreements, support the diversification of exports through lower transport costs, and enhance \n \n1  Following the ceasefire between Armenia and Azerbaijan signed on 9 November 2020, the two countries have \ncommitted to unblocking all transport and economic links in the region and to reviving the transport link from Baku, \nthrough southern Armenia, to Azerbaijan\u2019s exclave Nakhichevan. \n2  Unresolved conflicts in the region leave borders between Armenia and Azerbaijan and Armenia and Turkey closed. \nThis divides Azerbaijan from its exclave Nakhichevan and requires that trade, travel, and transit between Turkey and \nthe South Caucasus region take place only through Georgia or by air.  \n3  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. The four Operational Priorities that the TA is aligned with are: accelerating progress in gender equality, \npromoting rural development and food security, strengthening governance and institutional capacity, and fostering \nregional cooperation and integration. \n4  ADB. 2019.

The TA will be aligned with and built upon completed or ongoing work under ADB\u2019s TA \nprojects for (i) Analysis of Economic Opportunities Associated with Armenia\u2019s New Trade Regime \nwhich analyzes tariff policy changes in Armenia, 8 (ii) Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy, \n2020\u20122024  which  supports  the  preparation  and  initial  implementation  of the  strategy, 9 (iii) \nPartnership with the Private Sector for Sustainable Trade Facilitation Results in the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation Program (CAREC), which aims to strengthen partnerships \nbetween  private  and  public  stakeholders  in  CAREC  countries,10 (iv)  Supporting  Economic \nCorridor Development in Armenia and Georgia to Enhance Trade and Competitiveness which \nassesses options to implement an economic corridor between Armenia and Georgia,11 and (v) \nFacilitation of Regional Transit Trade in CAREC, which piloted the CAREC Advanced Transit \nSystem in Azerbaijan and Georgia, as well as other CAREC TA projects.12 The TA will provide \nthe economic framework to discover and develop regional manufacturing value chains that are \nbeing developed under ADB\u2019s TA for Supporting Economic Corridor Development in Armenia and \nGeorgia (footnote 11) and complement its work by conceptualizing regional food value chains. \nThe TA will also benefit from the work under ADB\u2019s TA for Transport and Trade Facilitation \nStrategy (footnote 9) which assesses the feasibility of opening previously closed transport routes. \n \n6.  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has hit the region hard with sickness, loss \nof life, and economic contraction. The pandemic has been an unprecedented shock and has had \na significant impact on global and regional supply chains, trade, tourism, remittances, and other \nfinancial flows. The pandemic has highlighted the importance of regional cooperation, including \nthrough financial assistance, sharing of best practices and joint actions to contain the spread of \nthe virus. Vaccines are gradually becoming available in 2021 to support the economic recovery. \nStronger regional cooperation in South Caucasus is critical to sustain this recovery and put the \ncountries on a higher growth path. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  This regional TA supports Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia to develop the SCRCA to \nmaximize the benefits of economic cooperation and leverage the region\u2019s geostrategic importance \nby opening transit and trade routes and developing value-added exports through regional value \nchains. The new gateways will allow higher trade turnover that will reduce unit costs of both \nexports (improving their price competitiveness) and imports (reducing overall price levels for the \n \n7  The region is also an important energy hub because of the South Caucasus Pipeline, which transports natural gas \nfrom Baku (Shah Deniz gas field), through Georgia to Turkey, and runs parallel to the Baku\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Ceyhan oil \npipeline. \n8  ADB. 2018.

New trade routes will help reduce trade risks in the region and increase \nthe feasibility of transformative infrastructure investments. The benefits of increased regional \nintegration will also reduce political risks by increasing the costs of segregation. \n  \n8.  The TA is focused on (i) assessments of the regional potential for developing agro-food \nvalue  chains,  joint  tourism  initiatives,  multi-modal  transport  routes,  and  the  comparative \nadvantage of exports prepared within political economy considerations; and (ii) the formulation of \nan SCRCA to assess the benefits of economic cooperation within and across the region amid \npolitical uncertainties. \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: understanding and commitment of Caucasus \ncountries with a shared vision for the South Caucasus Gateway improved.13 The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: trade among Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and their neighbors increased.14  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output  1:  Potential  for  trade,  transit,  regional  value  chains  and  free  trade \nagreements assessed within political economy considerations. Assessments on the regional \npotential for developing agro-food value chains, joint tourism initiatives, multimodal transport \nroutes, and the comparative advantage of exports will be prepared to gauge the trade and transit \npotential  for  relevant  commodities,  including  food  and  agricultural  goods,  corresponding \nmultimodal transport options, and the opportunity for establishing regional value chains and free \ntrade agreements. Opening transport corridors promises significant economic gains for the South \nCaucasus region by reducing the cost of transit trade thus improving export price-competitiveness \nand lowering the costs of imports. Advancing regional agro-food value chains in South Caucasus \naims to promote food security, increase value addition to export products, and expand productive \ncapabilities to support structural transformation. The assessments will also scope the tourism \npotential  of  newly  opened  gateways,  while  also  considering  reopening  gateways,  changed \npreferences resulting from COVID-19, and national tourism strategies in Armenia, Azerbaijan, \nand Georgia. The outputs will consider political economy, environment, climate change adaptation \nand mitigation, and gender. \n \n11.  Output 2: South Caucasus Regional Cooperation Approach developed. Based on \noutput 1, the SCRCA 2022\u20132026 will be developed to help unleash the economic potential of the \nSouth Caucasus region. The approach will provide options to identify and optimize international \nand domestic gateways and provide a roadmap for the region to regain its historical significance \nin trade and transit. The SCRCA will scope options for regional cooperation, new transport routes \nwithin and across the region, and opportunities for joint participation in regional cooperation \nprograms and customs or trade agreements. The approach will include an investment plan to help \nprioritize investments that will attract regional transit trade, in cooperation with development \npartners. The SCRCA\u2019s design and implementation will be prepared in dialogue with private and \ncivil society representatives to ensure the engagement and ownership of stakeholders.  \n \n   \n \n13 The TA impact is defined in line with ADB's country partnership strategies for Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. \n14  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2.  \n \n13.  The governments of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia will provide counterpart support in \nthe form of counterpart staff, office space and supplies, required study materials, information, data, \nand other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. The Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination \nDivision of ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department will implement the TA in close coordination \nwith the Armenia Resident Mission, the Azerbaijan Resident Mission, and the Georgia Resident \nMission, and other operations and knowledge departments. Throughout the implementation \nperiod of the TA, the project team will prioritize sensitive and careful communication with all \ncounterparts and stakeholders, guided by a communication plan. The TA will be implemented \nover 27 months (October 2021\u2013December 2023).
