INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2005 Country Programming Mission, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nasked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a fast-response facility to support policy \ndevelopment in priority areas of the current Eleventh Five-Year Plan (11thFYP \u2013 2006 to 2010) \nand the PRC\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP).1 In response, ADB included a technical \nassistance  (TA)  project  in  the  2006  TA  pipeline.  A  Fact-Finding  Mission2 was  fielded  in \nDecember 2005, and reached an agreement with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and  other \nconcerned  Government  agencies  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.3 The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The 11th FYP sets out a number of key priorities: \n \n(i)  Transform the economic growth model, aiming to conserve resources and protect \nthe environment. Recycling will be encouraged to reduce constraints from limited \nland, fresh water, energy, and mine resources. The legal and policy framework \nwill  be  strengthened  to  promote  clean  production.  Environmental  protection \nefforts will be enhanced to reduce air and water pollution, soil erosion, and \ndesertification. \n \n(ii)  Adjust  and  improve  industry  structure.  Important  areas  relevant  to  ADB \noperations include strengthening of  the intellectual property protection system; \ncreating an enabling environment for investment; promoting the development of \nservice industries, such as finance, insurance, logistics, information, and legal \nservices; and develop a stable, economic, and clean energy supply system. \n \n(iii)  Establish  a  socialistic  countryside  through  rural  development.  An  area  of \nemphasis is public services, which  includes (a) establishing free compulsory \neducation;  (b)  establishing  a  basic  public  health  system  and  new  Rural \nCooperative Medicare System; (c) expanding the use of biogas, and exploring \nthe use of suitable clean energy in rural areas; (d) enhancing vocational training \nfor rural labor; and (e) addressing rural poverty, including establishing a new rural \nsocial safety net. \n \n(iv)  Promote coordinated development of the different regions. The PRC will continue \nto  develop  the  western  region,  re-energize  the  northeastern  industry  base, \nfacilitate the rise of the middle region, and encourage continued development of \neastern region.  In addition, a  healthy and balanced urbanization process is \ncritical to regional development. \n \n(v)  Deepen legal and governance reform. Legal reform is the basis for governance \nreform in the areas of the administrative system, tax system, financial system, \nprivate sector development, and market economy.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2004-2006): People\u2019s Republic of China. \n2  The Mission comprised X. Zhang, Financial Economist, ADB Resident Mission in the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 22 December 2005. \n ", "2  \n3.  More specifically, the 11th FYP sets targets in certain key areas: (i) doubling the 2001 \ngross domestic product (GDP) by 2010; (ii) enhancing energy efficiency and reducing unit GDP \nenergy consumption by 20% of the 2005 level; (iii) controlling environmental deterioration; and \n(iv)  implementing  free  9-year  compulsory  education,  creating  employment  opportunities, \nimproving social security system, and reducing poverty. \n \n4.  The challenge now for the Government is to address the aforenoted priorities and meet \nthe targets during implementation of the 11th FYP over the next five years. To do so, the \nGovernment will need to formulate policies and undertake reforms in a wide range of areas. The \nGovernment is therefore seeking TA from ADB that will be flexible to address wide-ranging \npolicy development requirements and do so in a timely manner. \n \n5.  In response, this TA proposes a flexible mechanism to undertake a number of discreet \nand  focused  interventions  to  address  specific  policy  development  and  capacity  building \nrequirements that will arise from time-to-time during implementation of the 11th FYP. This TA will \nadopt a similar approach to TA 4365 (Facility for Policy Reform Support), which successfully \nprovided timely assistance to the Government in addressing urgent issues and disseminating \noutputs to the public and policy makers. 4 TA4365 has financed 10 components, including \nprivate  sector  study,  budget  law  amendment,  corporate  pension,  housing  finance,  and \nenvironment impact assessment. The outputs of the private sector study were transformed into \nthe top proposal by the China Political Consultation Commission to the National People\u2019s \nCongress in March 2005. The amended budget law, which has gone through public consultation, \nis  expected  to  be  submitted  to  the  National  People\u2019s  Congress.  The  corporate  pension \ncomponent suggested revisions to the two interim regulations on the management of the \ncorporate pension system and corporate pension fund, which the Ministry of Labor and Social \nSecurity is reviewing. The housing finance conference brought together recommendations of \ndomestic and international experts, which are being integrated into the practices of the China \nDevelopment  Bank.  The  environment  impact  assessment  component  has  enabled  the \ndissemination of ADB\u2019sE  nvironment Impact Assessment (2003) in the PRC, as well as the \ntraining of core staff in all provincial environment appraisal centers. The outputs were widely \ndisseminated through publications and internet. \n \n6.  The discreet components under TA 4365 addressed in  a timely manner  the urgent \ndemands of the implementing agencies (IAs). In addition, they supported reforms that were not \nprovided for in the TA pipeline. The components were selected in close coordination with MOF \nand PRCM based on a set of criteria identified in the TA.5 The candidate IAs proposed their \ndesign,  while  PRCM  or  designated  ADB  divisions  closely  monitored  their  implementation. \nSeveral lessons can be drawn: (i) ADB adds considerable value by providing such selective \nsmall-scale,  short-term  assistance  to  complement  its  long-term  and  systematic  efforts  in \nselected strategic areas; (ii) quick and timely response can enable early involvement in policy \nformulation; and (iii) capacity building needs to be included to address challenges arising from \nthe Government\u2019s evolving policies and procedures, as well as ADB\u2019s strategic requirements. \nThe proposed TA is expected to build on these lessons to provide a flexible mechanism that can \nrespond quickly to the needs of the Government. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2004.  Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Facility for Policy Reform Support \n(approved on 26 July for $450,000). \n5  The criteria, as described in the TA, include \u201c(i) al ltopics are consistent with the reform agenda set out in the PRC \nCSP, (ii) the Government must accord the policy reform a high priority, (iii) the proposed policy reform has reached \na mature stage, and (iv) a small amount of strategic assistance will help push the reform agenda forward.\u201d \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The objective of the TA is to provide quick, timely and quality support for reforms and \ncapacity building in the priority areas of the 11FYP as they arise, as well as the ADB\u2019s strategic \nfocus areas in the PRC. Three TA outputs in ADB\u2019s strategic areas, as well as the Government \nreform agenda, have been identified (see Appendix 3 for details).  \n \n(i)  Local government debt. This is the first phase of a study on local government \ndebt with implications on governance and risk management of local governments. \nThe study will compile information on local government debt management in \nselected market economies, including (a) laws and regulations, (b) budgeting, (c) \naccounting and reporting system, (d) information system, and (e) early warning \nmechanisms.  Best  practices  and  lessons  of  relevant  countries  will  be \nsummarized and evaluated. Preliminary recommendations will be made on the \nlegal  framework  and  other  issues, including fiscal transfer and delegation of \nduties  from  central  to  local  governments,  authority  and  power  of  local \ngovernments  in  determining  local  taxes,  and  decision  making  and  approval \nprocedures  for  the  local  governments\u2019  budge.t  (ADB  Financing:  $100,000; \nConsulting Services: 5 person-months; Time Frame: August 2006\u2013March 2007) \n \n(ii)  Portfolio management. The component will produce a study on effective project \nimplementation that addresses coordination and harmonization of processes and \nprocedures in EAs and IAs. It also will identify how to coordinate and harmonize \nthe Government\u2019s project cycle most effectively  with ADB\u2019s project processing \nand approval processes, as well as implementation procedures. In addition, the \nstudy will include approaches to effective and up-front capacity building of new \nEAs and IAs. The outcome also will include a comparative analysis of portfolio \nperformance of projects financed by other external funding agencies in the PRC, \nand  approaches  to  monitor  whether  ADB\u2019s  portfolio  has  been  contributing \neffectively to the CSP outcomes and country development. Finally, it will include \ndiscussions on necessary corrective actions for achieving better results. (ADB \nFinancing: $50,000; Consulting Services: 5 person-months; Time Frame: June\u2013\nDecember 2006) \n \n(iii)  Rural  social  safety  net.  This  component  will  focus  on  designing  and \nestablishing a rural social safety net. The aim will be to ensure a minimum living \nstandard for the destitute rural poor who lack productive capacity, such as the \nchildless elderly households, disabled, and female-headed households. Although \nthese groups comprise a growing share of the rural poor, the Government\u2019s \ndevelopment-based poverty reduction programs do not address their needs well. \n(ADB Financing: $50,000; Consulting Services: 3 person-months; Time Frame: \nAugust\u2013December 2006) \n \n8.  Future areas to be covered under the TA will  include policy and institutional reforms \nsuch as environment improvement, promotion of resource saving economy, rule of law, and \ngood governance,  which respond to emerging real-time needs of the Government. In these \nareas, ADB\u2019s involvement is expected top roduce notable policy and capacity building impacts \nto enhance ADB operations, including monitoring its portfolio\u2019s contribution to CSP outcomes. \nThe impacts include formulation and/or amendment of policies, laws, regulations, and design of \n ", "4  \ninstitutional structure, operational procedures, and capacity building mechanisms. Institutional \nreforms will mi prove efficiency in public services, while capacity building will enhance the \nGovernment\u2019s  understanding  of  ADB\u2019s  new  Innovation  and  Efficiency  Initiatio nA.dditional \ncomponents  will  be  identified  during  the  two-year  TA  implementation  period  according  to \nselection criteria stipulated in para. 10 below.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will allow ADB to provide quick support to PRC\u2019s reform and capacity building \nefforts, which  will have strong result-orientation through specific advice in key priority areas \nwhere the Government is looking for suggestions and support.The flexible design will allow the \nselection of some topics during TA implementation, based on the following criteria: (i) topics \nmust be consistent with the reform agenda set out in the CSP of the PRC, and fall under the \nstrategic focus areas of ADB\u2019s operatiosn in  the PRC; (ii) the  Government must accord the \npolicy reform a high priority; and (iii) a small amount of strategic assistance must be able to help \nadvance the reform agenda. No components should be used for project preparation.  Their \nimpact on ADB\u2019s portfolio and project management will determine the eslection of capacity \nbuilding components. ADB staff will monitor the TA progress and outputs closely, and discuss \nthe policy with relevant Government agencies. \n \n10.  For each component, conferences and workshops will be  held to discuss the issues, \nbuild  consensus,  and  disseminate  information.  During  the  conferences  and  workshops, \nintensive consultations will be conducted between staff of EAs and IAs, and international and \ndomestic officials. The participants might come from the relevant Government agencies, private \nsector,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  external  funding  agencies.  The  assistance  will \ninclude information dissemination mechanisms in English and Chinese. The outputs will be \npublished on the ADB Web site and in hardcopy format. When needed, press conferences will \nbe held. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.   The TA is estimated to cost $680,000 equivalent. The Government has asked ADB to \nfinance $500,000 equivalent on a grant basis from ADB's TA funding program. The Government \nwill finance the balance of the cost, equivalent to $180,000, through the provision of office space, \ncounterpart staff, honorarium, and other miscellaneous services. Of the identified components, \nthe local government debt component is estimated  to cost $100,000,  while the  other  two \ncomponents  are  expected  to  cost  $50,000  each.  Appendix  2  has  the  details  of  the  cost \nestimates and the financing plan. \n \n12.  The cost estimate is based on engaging eight international experts as resource persons \nfor 2 person-months, 10 domestic experts as resource persons for 2 person-months, and nine \nindividual  consultants  for  20  person-months.  The  resource  persons  mainly  will  share \ninternational experience and practices, which will be limited to  the short term. The resource \npersons and individual consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with the ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants. To facilitate seminars and conferences, an advance \npayment facility can be provided to the IAs. \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  As the EA  for  the TA,  MOF will  be responsible for  coordinating  and implementing \nrelevant activities. The  IAs for  each component will depend on the topics. The IAs for the \nidentified  components  include:  (i)  MOF\u2019s Budget  Department  for  local  government  debt \ncomponent; (ii) MOF\u2019sI nternational Department for the portfolio management component; and \n(iii)  Ministry  of  Civil  Affairs  for  the  rural  safety  net  component.  Potential  IAs should be \ngovernment agencies and government-owned or -controlled entities that are able to prepare a \nclear proposal, and have sufficient staff capacity and office space to implement the TA.  \n \n14.  The  Government  will  participate  actively  in  topic  selection,  assistance  design,  and \nimplementation. Potential IAs should send future proposals for candidate components to MOF. \nThe PRCM and MOF jointly will select future components that are high on the Government\u2019s \nagenda and  fall under the strategic focus areas of ADB\u2019s operations in the PRC. The TA is \nexpected to begin in June 2006, and be completed by June 2008. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of  the People\u2019s Republico f China for the Facility for Reform Support and \nCapacity Building, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData \nDesign  Performance  Assumptions \nSources/Reporting \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nSupport reforms outlined  \u2022  Inclusive and equitable  \u2022  Government reports   \u2022 The Government\u2019s \nin ADB\u2019s country strategy  economic growth  \u2022  Monitoring by PRCM   commitment to policy and \nand program for the PRC,  \u2022  An enabling  \u2022  ADB review missions  institutional reforms \nand capacity building to  environment for private  \u2022 Sustained macroeconomic \nenhance ADB portfolio  sector development  development \nand project management  \u2022  Improved governance    \n  \u2022  Enhanced ADB \nportfolio and project \nperformance \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nEnhanced efficiency of  \u2022  Improved governance  \u2022  Government reports   \u2022 Government\u2019sc ommitment to \npolicy making and  and risk management  \u2022  Monitoring by PRCM   policy reforms and adoption of \nimplementation in  of local governments  \u2022  ADB review missions  the policy recommendations \nstrategically focused  \u2022  Improved social safety     \nareas, consistent with  net in rural areas  Risks \nADB\u2019s portfolio of projects  \u2022  Better financial access  \u2022 Recommendations by the TA \n  of SMEs  are not adopted \n\u2022  Portfolio performance  \u2022 Legal and market risks limit \nof ADB projects in line  SMEs\u2019  access to finance \nwith the CSP outcomes  \u2022 Loss of institutional memory \n   when the training staff leave \nposts \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Local Government Debt \n1.  Background Information \n1.  Local governments in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) are forbidden from issuing \ndebt. The central Government wants to maintain prudent debt management, and is concerned \nthat  local  governments\u2019  issuance  of  debt  might  disturb  local  financial  stability  and  local \neconomic  development.  However,  taxes  and  other  revenues  are  inadequate  for  local \ngovernments to maintain rapid economic growth. As a result, many local governments have to \ngo around the central Government regulations and carry debt in many forms, including implied \nguarantees for loans of local government-owned enterprises, auction of state assets, etc. While \nthese hidden debts are difficult to discern and calculate, they could pose major problems to the \nfinancial status of local governments. \n \n2.  The PRC and the international community have become increasingly concerned about \nlocal  government  debt  issues.  However,  conducting  systematic,  in-depth,  and  practically \nvaluable research in the area is fairly difficult, because local government debt is forbidden and \nlocal governments are sensitive about the topic.  \n \n3.  Nevertheless,  the  establishment  of  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  local \ngovernment  debt  is  important  to  enhance  governance  and  risk  management  of  local \ngovernments. This will  allow the issuance and management of local government debt to be \nregulated, thereby preventing or controlling local government debt risks. To achieve this, the \nBudget  Department  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  urgently  needs  to  analyze  laws, \nregulations, and operational procedures of selected countries. Further, it must make preliminary \nrecommendations on laws, regulations, and other technical issues, including the accounting and \nreporting system, information system, and early warning system. These counties could include \nAustralia, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States. \n \n2.  Generic Terms of Reference for Consultants \n4.  This  component  will  require  the  recruitment  of  one  domestic  government  debt \nmanagement specialist (3 person-months) and one fiscal risk management specialist (2 person-\nmonths) to prepare a report on local government debt management. The government debt \nmanagement specialist will be responsible for the legal and regulatory framework of the report. \nThe  fiscal  risk  management  specialist  will  be  responsible  for  the  accounting,  reporting, \ninformation, and early warning systems aspects of the report. The report will compile information \non local government debt management in selected countries identified by MOF. The consultants \nalso will provide logistical support to the Implementing Agency (IA) in organizing workshops and \nconferences. \n \n5.  Three international resource persons (around 7 days each) will be invited to share their \ninternational experiences and best practices of local government debt management.  \n \n \n \n ", "10 Appendix 3 \n \nB.  Portfolio Management Training for Asian Development Bank (ADB) Projects  \n1.  Background Information \n6.  As of 2005, ADB\u2019s loan commitmenst to the PRC since the start of operations in 1987 \ncomprised 115 public sector loans, totaling $16.2 billion, all from the ordinary capital resources \n(OCR). This represents about 14.5% of ADB\u2019s lending to its developing member countries \n(DMC) since ADB was established. ADB has lent on average more than $1 billion per year to \nthe PRC since 1993, including $1.46 billion in 2005. The PRC portfolio has been one of the best \namong ADB\u2019s DMCs. The number of at-risk projects is below the ADB average, and a majority \nof continuing projects are rated satisfactory in ADB\u2019sp roject performance report system. Project \ncompletion reports and  project performance evaluation reports have rated most completed \nprojects as successful. \n \n7.  However, the performance can be improved. Country portfolio reviews (CPR) identified \nkey portfolio issues, and recommended actions to improve portfolio performance. These issues \nincluded (i) start-up delays, (ii) slow disbursement for some projects, (iii) difficulties by the \nexecuting agencies (EA) in complying with loan financial covenants, and (iv) extensions of loan \nclosing dates. \n \n8.  In addition, the profile of the portfolio is expected to change significantly within next three \nyears. While transport projects still will dominate ADB\u2019s operations int he PRC, the share of the \nagriculture  and  natural  resources  sector  and  the  social sector will increase substantially. \nMeanwhile, sector lending, multi-tranche financing facilities, and similar modalities will be used \nincreasingly for new projects, which might  include some small projects. More far-reaching \nchanges  are  also  likely  under  the  Partnership  Framework  with  Middle  Income  and  OCR \nCountries. These changes would improve future project implementation. ADB has taken some \ninitiatives to increase the  flexibility of procurement operations. However, the processing and \nimplementation of these projects will involve many stakeholders, who might not have  been \ninvolved in ADB operations. Considering the issues in project implementation, as well as the \nchanging context and shift in operational strategy, ADB\u2019s PRC portfolio needs to be reviewed, \nthe  key  constrains  on  project  processing  and  implementation  analyzed,  and  measures  to \neffectively facilitate project formulation and implementation recommended.  \n \n2.  Generic Terms of Reference for Consultants \n9.  Two  domestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  for  a  total  of  5  person-months.  One \nconsultant will be responsible for a study on effective project implementation. Specifically, the \nstudy will examine the participation of EAs and IAs in all project cycles. The consultant will \nreview the implementation arrangements of ADB-financed PRC projects in each sector. The \neffectiveness of these implementation arrangements then will be assessed based on the review, \nand major constraints and issues that impede smooth project implementation will be identified. \nThe study will look into options to strengthen EAs\u2019  and IAs\u2019  ownershipf  tohe implementation \narrangements.  Further,  it  will  examine  options  for  their  proactive  participation  in  project \nformulation, implementation, and operation. This task will take 3 months, starting in April 2006. \n \n10.  The other consultant will conduct  a  comprehensive  review  on  ADB\u2019s PRC portfolio \nperformance, including approaches to correlate  the portfolio performance contribution to the \ncountry strategy and  program (CSP) outcomes. The consultant will  review thoroughly the \nportfolio, and identify key portfolio performance issues that need to be addressed to improve \nperformance. Based on this review, the consultant will recommend key actions to be taken by \n ", "Appendix 3  11\nADB, EAs, IAs, and Government to improve project implementation and portfolio performance, \nand to contribute effectively to CSP outcomes. This task will take 2 months, beginning in July \n2006. \n \n11.   Both consultants should have in-depth knowledge of  ADB project cycle, safeguard \npolicies, thematic priorities, and sector policies.  In addition, the consultants should be fully \naware  of  Government  approval  procedures  for  project  development,  and  Government \nadministrative framework for project implementation. \n \nC.  Rural Social Safety Net  \n1.  Background Information \n12.   The PRC has made remarkable progress in reducing poverty, cutting the number of \nrural people living in absolute poverty6 from roughly 250 million in 1978 to an estimated 26.1 \nmillion in 2004.  Despite the Government\u2019s expanding efforts and increasing investment, the \npoverty reduction in the PRC has decelerated. This reflects, in part, the shifting nature of \npoverty in the PRC, which increasingly is concentrated  in remote communities and hard-to-\nreach groups, such as the elderly and disabled who lack productive capacity. While these \ngroups comprise a growing share of the absolute poor rural population, the Government\u2019s \ndevelopment-based poverty reduction programs\u2014premised on lifting the poor out of poverty by \nenhancing opportunities for improved productivity and work income\u2014do not address their needs \nwell.  \n \n13.  Within the Government, the consensus is growing on the need to establish viable rural \nminimum living standards schemes (MLSS) capable of meeting the needs of the poorest of the \npoor who lack productive capacity. This consensus is rooted in international experiences and in \nthe PRC\u2019st rack record in implementing urban MLSS to address urban poverty, which fall under \nthe Ministry of Civil Affairs (MOCA). As reflected in recommendations released by the Central \nCommunist Party to guide the drafting of the PRC\u2019s1 1th Five-Year Program for Economic and \nSocial Development (2006\u20132010), the construction of such a rural system will be a priority. This \nnew direction is consistent with\u2014and appears to have been partly catalyzed by\u2014recent policy \nadvocacy by ADB. The MLSS component  of the technical assistance  also builds on ADB\u2019s \ncooperation with MOCA under Facility for Policy Reform Support (TA4365) in taking stock and \nconducting  a  preliminary  assessment  of  early  efforts  to  pilot  test  rural  MLSS  in  several \nprovinces.    \n \n2.  Generic Terms of Reference for Consultants \n14.  One domestic expert on MLSS will be hired for 3 person-months to coordinate inputs \nfrom four resource persons spanning related areas of expertise, including indicatively income \nand  non-income  poverty,  poverty  targeting,  financing,  and  institutional  assessment  at \nsubnational  levels.  One  international  resource  person  (10  days  of  inputs)  will provide a \nsummary report on international experiences and best practices in MLSS systems, emphasizing \nrelevance to the PRC context.   \n \n15.  In close dialogue with ADB and MOCA, the expert and resource person will prepare a \nbackground study and presentations for a forum on rural MLSS in the PRC, including core \n                                                 \n6  This figure refers to the official annual per capita income line of CNY668 in 2004, which is low by international \nstandards. \n ", "12 Appendix 3 \n \ncontent of a concrete and viable framework for instituting a rural MLSS system. This will be \nbased on policy dialogue with MOF and other relevant ministries and agencies at the national \nand  subnational  levels,  including  analysis  of  issues  related  to  vertical  and  horizontal \ncoordination. The framework also should present links to additional pro-poor interventions, such \nas existing rural poverty reduction and development programs, education, and health care. The \nexpert will be responsible for delivering the final framework of policy and (as appropriate) \ninstitutional reforms, integrating refinements from  the review at the conference.  The expert \nshould possess strong communication skills, and experience in high-level policy dialogue. \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20060626155526+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20060605152655Z", "Title": "Facility for Reform Support and Capacity Building", "Creator": "tafacilityii_final_edited_20060519 - Microsoft Word", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 10 May 2006) \n \nCurrency Unit  \u2013  yuan (CNY) \nCNY1.00  =  $0.12 \n$1.00  =  CNY8.004 \n \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  ADTA  \u2013  advisory technical assistance \n  CSP  \u2013  country strategy and program \n  EA  \u2013  executing agency \n  FYP  \u2013  Five-Year Program \n  GDP  \u2013  gross domestic product \n  IA  \u2013  implementing agency \n  MOCA  \u2013  Ministry of Civil Affairs \n  MOF  \u2013  Ministry of Finance \n  PRC  \u2013  People\u2019s Republic of Chin a\n  PRCM  \u2013  ADB Resident Mission in the People\u2019s Republic of Chin a\n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n       \n \n \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \n \nTargeting Classification  \u2013  General intervention \nSector  \u2013  Governance \nThemes  \u2013  Inclusive social development, governance, capacity development \n \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government ends on 31 December.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n \n \n \n \nVice President  L.
