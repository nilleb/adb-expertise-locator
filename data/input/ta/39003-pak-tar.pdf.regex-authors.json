The provincial governments in Pakistan have recently implemented reforms to reduce \npoverty, develop the social sectors, and achieve good governance. The policy dialogue in the \nprovinces in the past 2 years has been supplemented by a comprehensive study of economic \nperformance  and  growth  potential,  as  presented  in  provincial  economic  reports.  The \ngovernment of Balochistan has accordingly requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  the  preparation  of  an  economic  report  analyzing  the \nBalochistan  economy  in  depth  and  proposing  a  strategy  for  the  sustainable  growth  and \ndevelopment of the province over the long term. Like the economic reports for Punjab and \nSindh,  the  Balochistan  economic  report  (BER),  as  proposed,  will  be  prepared  by  ADB  in \ncollaboration with the World Bank. The BER will build on previous analytical and policy papers \nof the provincial government (such as the multiple indicators cluster survey and the Balochistan \npoverty  reduction  strategy  paper  [PRSP])  and  donors  (such  as  the  participatory  poverty \nassessment funded by the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom1), \nand provide direction and a strategy for stimulating sustainable economic growth. The report will \nalso use insights from ADB\u2019s operational and analytical work in the last few years, including the \nBalochistan Resource Management Program (BRMP) TA,2 which produced several technical \nstudies for the province.3\n \n2.  A fact-finding mission visited Quetta, the capital of Balochistan, from 28 September to \n1 October 2005, and held extensive discussions with the provincial government and civil society \norganizations.4 This paper discusses the TA activities and their expected outcome, outputs, and \nimpact, as well as the implementing and financing arrangements. The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1.5  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Balochistan is the largest province of Pakistan, covering 44% of the country\u2019s area, but \nis  home  to  only  5%  of  the  country\u2019s  population.  Its  strengths  lie  in  its  wealth  of  natural \nresources, the vast rangeland, the coastal belt with 750 km of as yet undeveloped coastline, \nand rich mineral and hydrocarbon  deposits. But this enormous resource potential remains \nuntapped, and Balochistan lags behind other provinces in economic development. Average \nhousehold incomes are low, as there is little industrial activity and employment opportunities \noutside agriculture and mining are limited. According to the Balochistan PRSP, poverty could be \nas high as 47%. \n \n4.  Economic growth in Balochistan, has stagnated in the past decade because of limited \ninvestment and capital accumulation. The last drought (1997\u20132002) decimated the livestock \npopulation, and rural incomes have been hit the hardest. Lacking a coordinated economic policy \nand  a  viable  strategy  for  economic  development,  the  province  has  seen  no  significant \ninvestment in productive streams (such as minerals, agribusiness, and fisheries) and human \nresource development. Fiscal and financial mismanagement has led to deterioration in the \n                                                 \n1 Government of Balochistan. 2003.

Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Preparing the Balochistan Resource \nManagement Program. Manila (TA 4230-PAK). \n3 The compendium studies for the BRMP TA on poverty, labor reforms, public service delivery, fiscal and financial \nmanagement, and water management are now being published.  \n4 The World Bank mission for the BER also visited Quetta on these dates. \n5 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 26 June 2005. \n ", "2  \npublic service delivery infrastructure. Also, the unit cost of public service delivery in the province \nis high, as population density is only 19 per square kilometer (against the national average of \n166). As a result, Balochistan\u2019s human development indicators, including gender disparity, are \nmuch worse than the national average. Female literacy is 16% (versus 32% for Pakistan), while \nmaternal mortality is 600 per 100,000 live births (versus 350 for Pakistan). \n \n5.  The  BRMP,6  approved  in  2004,  is  expected  to  improve  resource  mobilization, \nexpenditure  efficiency,  and  service  delivery  by  the  government.  Building  on  these  fiscal \nmanagement reforms, the BER will assess the constraints on growth and investment in key \nsectors and provide a cohesive economic strategy, identifying growth poles that will give the \nprovince the required momentum to sustain economic growth and reduce poverty, in line with \nthe objectives of the Balochistan PRSP. \n \n6.  Mining and Minerals. Thirty-nine minerals, of the recorded 50, are now being mined in \nthe province. In FY2003 this sector yielded revenues of almost PRs1 billion. The discovery of \nlarge copper deposits in the Chagai district, coupled with the coal and iron ore production in the \nprovince, can generate significant additional income for the provincial government. \n  \n7.  Agriculture and Livestock. Over half the labor force is employed in agriculture. A \ncritical  issue,  however,  is  the  scarcity  of  water,  which  is  worsened  by  frequent  droughts, \ninefficient use of water as a result of a flat-rate tube-well subsidy, and overextraction. The loss \nof 43% of the livestock population in the last drought has deepened poverty in the province. \n \n8.  Coastal Development and Fisheries. The Balochistan coastline, at 750 km, makes up \n70% of Pakistan\u2019s coastline but contributes only 30% of Pakistan\u2019s landed catch. Ship harbors \nat both Gawadar and Pasni lack supporting infrastructure and services, and an estimated 30% \nof marine catch is wasted owing to the lack of modern processing facilities. By integrating the \ndevelopment of the coastal highway and the Gawadar port, the economic strategy can create \nlinkages that support development and add value to the fishing sector and the local economy. \n \n9.  Growth Leverage from Mega Investment Projects. The government is investing a \nvery large amount to develop Gawadar port into a strategic economic hub. The geographic \nlocation of the port makes it an ideal gateway to Afghanistan and the landlocked Central Asian \nrepublics. Other major infrastructure projects are also being planned, among them, the 533 km \nMekran coastal highway and PRs3.8 billion investments in roads, railway extension, and similar \nprojects. Such projects, if integrated with provincial economic policy, can stimulate economic \nactivity and generate growth and employment in the province. \n \n10.  The  government  of  Balochistan  realizes  that,  without  a  sound  assessment  of  the \nprovincial economy, it is difficult to monitor the progress of current programs or to design new \nones. Balochistan is one of two provinces in Pakistan (the other is Punjab)7 where ADB has \ndeveloped a comprehensive assistance program that includes key governance initiatives. The \nBRMP is the most comprehensive public resource management program to be implemented in \nthe  province.  Similarly,  the  upcoming  Balochistan  Devolved  Social  Services  Program  will \naddress  social  sector  development  issues  in  the  rural  areas,  and  the  Balochistan  Water \nResources and Rural Infrastructure Development Project to be processed in 2006 will deal with \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2004.

Given ADB\u2019s focus on this least developed of \nPakistan\u2019s  provinces,  there  is  an  urgent  need  for  ADB  to  support  the  development  of  an \naccurate picture of Balochistan\u2019s economy and social sectors and to improve the basis for policy \nformulation in the province. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The desired impact of the TA is to improve policy formulation in Balochistan by providing \na cohesive strategy for stimulating economic activity and accelerating growth and development.  \n \n12.  The TA will primarily support technical studies, facilitate policy dialogue, and assist the \ngovernment of Balochistan in organizing the annual Balochistan Development Forum (BDF) in \nApril  2006  and  March  2007.  The  envisioned  economic  report  will  provide  statistical  and \nanalytical insights into the provincial economy. At the request of the government, the social, \nproductive, and infrastructure sectors will be covered. A database of economic statistics and \nsocial  sector  indicators  on  Balochistan  will  be  created,  and  the  provincial  gross  domestic \nproduct will be calculated. The intermediate output will be the BDF in April 2006, where a policy \nvision paper stating Balochistan\u2019s immediate and medium-term economic development goals \nwill be presented. The paper will be based on an analysis of economic and human development \ntrends and a preliminary estimate of provincial accounts. The final output of the TA will be the \nBER, to be presented at the BDF in March 2007. In summary, the TA will provide the necessary \nresources and expertise to assist the government of Balochistan in (i) developing a social and \neconomic statistics database, including estimates of provincial output; (ii) designing a provincial \neconomic development strategy; and (iii) facilitating policy dialogue among the federal and \nprovincial governments, business and civil society, and donors.  \n \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  In the first 4 months of the TA, statistical and economic data on the province will be \ncollated, provincial income statistics developed, and the policy vision paper prepared. Building \non the insights from this exercise and the direction provided by the vision paper, the subsequent \nanalyses will highlight the constraints on the economic development of Balochistan, conduct a \ncomprehensive  sectoral  analysis,  and  propose  a  strategy  for  economic  development  and \npoverty reduction. The main integrating theme of the BER will be the formulation of a cohesive \nstrategy to target sustainable, widespread growth.  \n \n14.  ADB will lead the preparation of the report and provide technical expertise in (i) small- \nand medium-sized enterprise (SME) and private sector development; (ii) urban economies and \nurban sector development; (iii) Gawadar port development, economic geography, and transport \nnetworks; and (iv) fiscal and financial management. The World Bank will provide technical \nexpertise in (i) agriculture, livestock, water, and irrigation; (ii) mining and the oil and gas sector; \nand (iii) public service delivery and poverty reduction. The proposed policies will be aimed at \ncross-sectoral  growth  and  integrated  economic  development.  The  focus  of  ADB\u2019s  area  of \nresponsibility will be as follows. \n \n15.  Generating Income and Employment. The report will highlight key growth poles for the \nregion. Certain sectors, such as the SME sector, mining, agribusiness, and fisheries, could \ngenerate incomes and employment. The BER will review the key barriers to private sector \n ", "4  \ndevelopment in these sectors and identify viable initiatives to stimulate private investment and \ncapital accumulation. \n \n16.  Developing SMEs and Private Enterprise. ADB will provide technical expertise to \n(i) identify  the  financial,  regulatory,  and  institutional  constraints  on  SMEs;  (ii)  conduct  a \nstructural  analysis  of  the  SME  sector,  supported  by  a  quantitative  survey  of  small-scale \nindustries, and stratify the sector by scale and industry; (iii) highlight subsectors with high \npotential for growth and private sector investment; and (iv) propose an integrated strategy to \npromote SME development and employment generation.  \n \n17.  Developing the Urban Sector. ADB experts will assess the potential of urban growth \ncenters in Balochistan. They will look at the nexus between regional development (for instance, \nagribusiness  in  northern  Balochistan,  mining  in  Chagai  district,  cross-border  trade  through \nChaman, and the Gawadar port development along the coast) and investment in infrastructure \nand roads. To arrive at the urban strategy, the experts will (i) analyze major cities and townships \nin Balochistan and assess their potential to function as urban growth nodes; (ii) design a \nstrategy  to  integrate  regional  economic  development  with  urbanization;  (iii)  assess  the \nsocioeconomic impact of urban growth and migration on the provincial economy; and (iv) design \nan  urbanization  policy  to  support  urban  development  and  facilitate  the  growth  of  service \ninfrastructure for regional economic industries. \n \n18.  Improving Fiscal and Financial Management. Sector specialists will build on the work \nof  the  BRMP  and  update  the  framework  for  efficient  public  revenue  and  expenditure \nmanagement by (i) conducting a microanalysis of fiscal and financial trends, and (ii) developing \nprovincial income estimates to guide the analysis.  \n \n19.  Maximizing the Economic Impact of Large-Scale Investment Projects. Technical \nexperts will review the impact of the Gawadar port development and other mega infrastructure \nprojects on the provincial economy. They will (i) assess the potential of Gawadar to become a \nregional trade and investment hub; (ii) identify profitable avenues for cross-border trade and \nrecommend policies to facilitate and develop exports; (iii) propose measures to support the \ncreation of markets and export avenues for the minerals, fisheries, livestock, and other key \nsectors;  and  (iv)  develop  a  strategy  for  the  use  of  Gawadar  and  supporting  transport \ninfrastructure for participatory and cohesive development in the local and provincial economy.  \n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $375,000  equivalent\u2014$100,000  in  foreign \nexchange  costs  and  $275,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $300,000, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $200,000 of \nthe local currency cost. ADB will finance this amount on a grant basis from its TA funding \nprogram. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent to \n$75,000, by providing office space, counterpart staff support, and logistics for workshops and \nconsultations. Details of the costs and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The Planning and Development Department will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the \nTA, and the chief economist will be the TA project director. A steering committee, chaired by the \nadditional chief secretary, will oversee TA activities from a policy perspective, and give guidance \n ", "  5\nto  the  project  director.  The  committee  will  comprise  key  stakeholders  in  the  provincial \ngovernment, private sector, and civil society. The preparation of the BER will also involve \nbroad-based consultations: the vision paper and drafts of the technical studies will be presented \nat workshops attended by civil society, the business sector, and other stakeholders. \n \n22.  The World Bank will set aside $300,000 in its 2005 and 2006 budget for the preparation, \npublication, and dissemination of the BER. There will be periodic multipartite reviews (by ADB, \nthe  World  Bank,  government  of  Balochistan,  and  consultants)  to  review  the  progress  of \nimplementation. These reviews will include joint missions fielded by ADB and the World Bank to \ndiscuss the outputs with the government at different stages of report preparation.  \n \n23.  The  TA  is  expected  to  be  implemented  over  18  months,  from  January  2005  to \nJune 2007. The implementation of the TA will require individual consultants who will provide 35 \nperson-months of consulting services\u20148 person-months for international consultants and 27 \nperson-months for local consultants. The international team leader will provide joint leadership \nand  direction  to  the  ADB  consultants  and  World  Bank  sector  experts,  give  advice  in  the \npreparation of the BER, coordinate and review the consultants\u2019 work, and develop the overall \ntheme of the report. The ADB sector specialists will have expertise in four broad categories: \n(i) SME and private sector development; (ii) urban economies and urban sector development; \n(iii) Gawadar port development, economic geography, and transport networks; and (iv) fiscal \nand financial management. A project coordinator reporting to the team leader and the Pakistan \nResident Mission (PRM) of ADB will establish linkages between TA components; facilitate \ncoordination between the World Bank, the EA, and PRM; and assist in the implementation of the \nTA. The TA will also finance the participation of a statistical expert at Quetta, who will provide \ntechnical support to the government of Balochistan to strengthen provincial capacity and the \nquality of data generation. The consultants will be engaged by ADB according to the Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  Its  Borrowers  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of consultants. The outline \nof the terms of reference for the consultants is in Appendix 3. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.
