INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The proposed regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) is a second \nphase continuation of a successful TA that complements the development impact of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Trade Finance Program (TFP). Moreover, this TA is critical to the \nfunctioning of the TFP as it provides additional resources required to conduct financial analysis, \ndue diligence, and annual reviews of the TFP obligor (and potential obligor) banks in developing \nmember countries (DMCs), banks on which the TFP assumes risk.1 \n \n2.  The TA is linked to a number of ADB strategies and business opportunities as presented \nin  (i)  country  partnership  strategies,  (ii)  regional  cooperation  strategies,  and  (iii)  country \noperations business plans for ADB's DMCs. A review of these documents underscores the \nimportance of trade finance capacity development in the DMCs to enable ADB to meet its \ndevelopment objectives. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The TA focuses on trade development issues that impede trade, including financing. \nMany DMC banks struggle to establish and/or maintain correspondent banking relationships \nwith international banks\u2014relationships that are needed to access loans and guarantees in \nsupport of trade. Some factors (e.g., political and macroeconomic instability) are beyond their \ncontrol, but DMC banks often lack knowledge of trade finance instruments, and may be unable \nto provide standard financial information to international banks. Such information is required to \nestablish trade finance lines of credit between international and DMC banks. The lack of trade \nfinance and financial reporting capacity among many DMC banks extends to transparency and \ngovernance issues, and reduces credit line availability from international banks. As a result, less \nfinancial support is available for DMC companies engaged in importing and exporting goods and \nservices. This reduces the availability and increases the cost of trade finance in many less-\ndeveloped countries, hindering their full participation in international trade, lowering economic \ngrowth and job creation potential. \n \n4.  The  TA  will  build  on  ongoing  work  under  ADB\u2019s  TA  for  Trade  Finance  Capacity \nDevelopment, (in other words Phase 1), which started in 2009 and was extended from 1 July \n2012 to 31 January 2013.2 Phase 1 of the TA provided in-depth credit analysis on over 100 \nDMC  banks  which  enabled  ADB  to  establish  credit  limits  on  banks  that  underpinned  the \nexponential growth of the TFP and its related development impact and mobilization of most of \nADB\u2019s commercial co-financing.  In addition, Phase 1 provided training to banks to improve their \ncapacity to provide trade finance to companies, including many SMEs. The proposed Phase 2 \nTA is required because the TFP will continue indefinitely \u2013 the Board agreed in July 2012 to \ndelete the TFP\u2019s 2013 sunset clause.  The TA provides TFP with much needed resources, \nincluding to: (i) conduct annual reviews of TFP participating obligor banks; (ii) conduct reviews \nof new potential TFP participating banks, including in new markets such as Myanmar; (iii) \nprovide capacity building for DMC banks.        \n \n \n   \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 March 2009. \n2  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Trade Finance Capacity Development. Manila (TA 7264-REG). \n ", "2   \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The impact of the TA will be sustained economic growth and improved living standards \nthrough the expansion of international and intraregional trade. Trade is a highly effective tool to \nhelp developing countries boost economic growth and generate the resources necessary to \nreduce poverty. Moreover, maintaining and enhancing trade finance lines in a countercyclical \nenvironment can enable the DMCs to acquire critical goods\u2014including medicine, food, fuel, and \ninputs for export production\u2014needed for subsistence and/or fundamental economic activity. The \noutcome  of the TA  will  be  enhanced  capacity  in  the  DMCs  and  DMC  banks,  resulting  in \nincreased trade finance to support trade in the DMCs. Specific outcome targets and the design \nand monitoring framework are in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n6.  The TA outputs and key activities are linked to the operation and on-going expansion of \nthe TFP. Currently, the TFP involves 119 international banks and 82 DMC banks, 48 of which \nwere added since January 2010. The 82 DMC banks are located in Afghanistan, Armenia, \nAzerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Georgia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, \nMongolia,  Nepal,  Pakistan,  Philippines,  Sri  Lanka,  Tajikistan,  Uzbekistan,  and  Viet  Nam. \nOngoing monitoring and trade finance capacity building for these banks would be among the \nkey TA activities. The number of DMC banks will increase to about 95 by the end of 2013. \nAccordingly,  this  TA  will  also  benefit  new  banks  in  the  TFP\u2019s  target  countries  including \nMyanmar, Turkmenistan, Timor Leste, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Samoa.3 The TA will have \nthe following outputs for the 12 months from February 2013 to January 2014.  \n \n1.  Knowledge Building in Developing Member Countries  \n \na.  DMC Bank Assessments and Capacity Building  \n \n7.  From February 2013 to January 2014, consultants engaged to deliver the TA will work in \nthe  field  and  conduct  about  32  assessments  of  new  banks,  approximately  99  monitoring \nassessments of banks already participating in TFP, and 24 assessments of country risk and \nbanking system. Through this work, ADB will undertake due diligence of the targeted individual \nDMC banks4 to identify and characterize gaps in their financial and technical capacity that would \ninhibit the provision and/or increase of trade finance credit lines. Information derived from the \nTA will benefit DMC banks by specifically identifying where they lack capacity, and will enable \nADB to provide capacity development that is tailored and specific to individual DMC banks and \nspecific DMC banking systems. \n \n8.  The  periodic  bank-monitoring  assessments  are  based  on  the  principle  of  repeat \nengagement, which views capacity building in the medium and long term (i.e., something that \ncannot be achieved through a single engagement). The TFP will undertake annual financial \nassessments (and/or quarterly covenant reviews). The annual reviews will help solidify capacity \ndevelopment, and create benchmarks enabling assessment of year-to-year improvements or \ndeclines in the capacity of a DMC to support trade finance credit lines. ADB expects 131 bank \nassessments will be conducted under the TA from February 2013 to January 2014. \n                                                \n3  The priority of countries targeted may change according to demand. Also, TFP expansion plans will be dependent \non additional human resources. \n4  The TA will target banks that have market demand for capacity development and will coordinate with the TFP in \nthis regard. \n ", "  3 \n \n9.  In addition to financial due diligence, the TA may fund technical assessments and due \ndiligence of the trade finance operations of DMC banks. The assessments will review existing \ncapabilities and identify gaps and weaknesses. The due diligence would be intended to audit \ndocumentation associated with trade loan transactions. This trade finance due diligence may \ninvolve visits to beneficiary companies. Based on the results of the technical assessments, the \nconsultants will work with TFP to recommend improvements in current systems, operations \nprocedures, and risk management that the consultant is expected to deliver through customized \nin-house training programs from February 2013 to January 2014.5  \n \n10.  The TA activities include:  \n(i)  work with individual DMC banks to acquire financial data; \n(ii)  analyze the financial information through financial, ratio, gap, and other analyses; \n(iii)  conduct due diligence with TFP staff for DMC banks by (a) meeting with banks; \n(b)  assessing  corporate  governance,  anti-money  laundering  policies,  and \nmanagement capabilities; and (c) asking questions related to financial analysis; \n(iv)  assess the trade finance operations capacity of selected banks and support the \nTFP in making recommendations for improvement; \n(v)  draft credit applications to be submitted to the TFP; \n(vi)  conduct a banking system analysis for each DMC; and \n(vii)  deliver training related to trade finance. \n \nb.  Knowledge Dissemination and Training Seminars \n \n11.  Information derived from the TA\u2019s financial assessments on individual banks will be \nconveyed directly to those banks on a confidential basis. In addition, the TA proposes to \ndisseminate  more  general  information  about  DMCs\u2019  banking  sectors  and  trade  finance \noperations to a larger audience within the DMCs through in-country seminars to which DMC \nbanks, exporters, government officials (including central bank officials), and international banks \nmay be invited, as appropriate. \n \n12.  The seminars will contribute to the development of the banking sector and trade finance \nin DMCs where both are still at a nascent stage of development. \n \n13.  The contents of each seminar will be fine-tuned to meet the requirement of the target \naudience.  \n \n14.  ADB plans to conduct four seminars over the course of the TA: one in Myanmar, one in \nKyrgyz Republic, one in Turkmenistan, and one in Papua New Guinea.6 \n \n2.  Partnership Development \n \n15.  TA  consultants  will  work  in  the  field,  in  coordination  with  the  TFP,  to  develop \npartnerships  between  international  and  DMC  banks.  Developing  partnerships\u2014such  as \ncorrespondent banking relationships with international banks\u2014is critical to fostering the financial \nsupport (trade finance credit lines) that underpins international and regional trade in the DMCs. \n \n16.  By  assessing  the  financial  position  of  various  DMC  banks  and  through  TFP\u2019s \nrelationships and mechanism for disseminating knowledge, the TA will help to bridge the gap \n                                                \n5  The number of in-house training programs will depend on the results of technical assessment and needs of the \nDMC banks. \n6  The countries may change based on changing demand.  \n ", "4   \nbetween  DMC  and  international  banks,  and  indirectly  between  exporting  and  importing \ncompanies. Furthermore, the TFP has listed on its website all DMC banks that have received \napproval of ADB\u2019s trade finance credit limits, enabling international banks to identify potential \nbanking partners in \u2018frontier markets\u2019. Working in conjunction with the TFP, the TA will explicitly \nand implicitly create the opportunity for international banks to consider those DMC banks to be \ncorrespondent banks. These relationships will support increased flows of capital and goods \nessential for economic activity and job creation. \n \n17.  The TFP expansion plans cover a multiyear period.
