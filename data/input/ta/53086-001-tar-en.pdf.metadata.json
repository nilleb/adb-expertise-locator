INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) in implementing its Strategic Plan for Rural Vitalization, 2018\u20132022.1 The TA will \nsupport sustainable agriculture production and waste management by (i) developing green \nagriculture production models for grain-producing areas of Heilongjiang and Shandong provinces \nexperiencing soil and land degradation, (ii) proposing new models for the effective treatment and \nmanagement of rural and agriculture organic waste in key grain producing areas, and (iii) \nsupporting Qinghai Province in implementing the Strategic Plan for Rural Vitalization, 2018\u20132022. \nThese outputs will generate new knowledge and strategies to support rural vitalization and \nsustainable agriculture development in the PRC. \n \n2.  The Government of the PRC requested TA from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nAgriculture Green Production and Waste Management.2 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan, 2019\u20132021 for the PRC.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The PRC has seen unprecedented economic growth from 1978 to 2017, lifting millions out \nof poverty and improving human well-being and quality of life across the country.4 However, this \nimpressive economic performance has had adverse environmental consequences that threaten \nthe livelihood and health of the population in rural areas and their neighboring urban centers. Soil \ncontamination and land degradation, water pollution, and poor resource management have \nbecome widespread and are pressing concerns for national and local governments. Adding to \nthese environmental pressures, the impacts of climate change, including irregular climate patterns \nand  extreme  weather  events,  have  already  severely  impacted  agriculture  and  undermined \neconomic progress, threatening the country\u2019s food and water security. \n \n4.  There is a need to transform agriculture production and address the ecological challenges \nthe PRC faces by promoting environmental protection, waste management, and sustainable \nagriculture development. The core problem of unsustainable agriculture production and lack of \necological protection of land, water, and other natural resources has multifaceted causes and \nnumerous effects. Excessive resource consumption, inefficient and unrestrained application of \nchemical pesticides and fertilizers on crops, and irrigation with untreated wastewater all contribute \nto the pollution of farmland and deterioration of the soil. Land degradation will only increase if the \nPRC\u2019s soil continues to suffer from reduced fertility, erosion, changes in acidity, accumulation of \nplastic film residues, the effects of climate change, and damage from pollutants. \n \n5.  Pollution  and  environmental  degradation  because  of  the  improper  treatment  and \nmanagement of rural and agriculture waste has also become an urgent concern. The rapid \ndevelopment of the PRC\u2019s livestock industry, driven by population growth, market demand, and \ntechnological and policy support, has been accompanied by a large increase in waste production \nfrom intensive livestock and poultry farms. The improper treatment and use of much of this waste \nhas had, and will continue to have, serious long-term ecological impacts. \n \n1  Government of the PRC. 2018.

While many of these environmental and agriculture development challenges are national \nand provincial concerns, effectively implementing the Strategic Plan for Rural Vitalization, 2018\u2013\n2022 in provinces such as Qinghai will require a deeper exploration of the constraints to, and \nopportunities for, rural vitalization. Important questions requiring further investigation include: \nWhat  are  the  key  constraints  facing  the  rural  farm  and  nonfarm  sector?  What  are  the \nenvironmental protection challenges in Qinghai? How does the province promote rural\u2013urban \nintegration and cohesion? How can Qinghai foster a culture of innovation and modernization in \nthe agriculture industry, develop agriculture value chains and link agribusinesses and local \nentrepreneurs  with  smallholder  farmers?  What  is  the  state  of  rural  service  delivery  and \ngovernance in Qinghai? Are there critical social and physical infrastructure gaps that need to be \naddressed, including lack of health, education, and financial services? Answers to these and other \nrelated questions will provide the first critical step in supporting an evidence-based, scientific, and \nsustainable approach to implementing the Strategic Plan for Rural Vitalization, 2018\u20132022 in \nQinghai. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: sustainable agriculture development and \necological environment improved.5 The TA will have the following outcome: opportunities to \nmodernize agriculture systems identified.6 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  The three outputs of the TA aim to address three distinct sets of challenges experienced \nby the PRC: they aim to understand how to (i) pivot toward green animal production and crop \ncultivation models; (ii) effectively treat, use, and manage rural organic waste; and (iii) effectively \nimplement rural vitalization in the provinces. All three outputs will generate new knowledge and \nawareness on sustainable agriculture development and support the Strategic Plan for Rural \nVitalization, 2018\u20132022 in the PRC. \n \n9.  Output 1: Knowledge of natural resource use and models for green agriculture \nproduction developed. This output will support the PRC in identifying improved models for green \nagriculture production in two key grain-producing areas experiencing soil and land degradation: \nHeilongjiang and Shandong provinces. Specifically, this output aims to (i) assess the state and \nusage of natural resources and animal and/or crop production systems in the two provinces; (ii) \nanalyze policies influencing natural resource use, chemical fertilizer and/or pesticide application, \nand agriculture production systems overall; and assess the social dimensions of production \nsystems; (iii) propose climate-friendly models for animal production and crop cultivation that \nincorporate food safety and quality issues; (iv) undertake a cost\u2013benefit analysis of the new green \nproduction models relative to current practices; and (v) prepare policy recommendations for \nprovincial and national governments on how to use natural resources more efficiently and balance \nagriculture production with environmental priorities. \n \n10.  Output 2: New models for the proper treatment, usage, and management of rural \norganic waste proposed. This output will assist the PRC in better understanding the current \nusage and management of crop straw residue in key grain-producing areas, and in identifying the \n \n5  Government of the PRC. 2018. Strategic Plan for Rural Vitalization, 2018\u20132022. Beijing. \n6  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \ntechnologies and models required for the effective reuse of crop straw. This output aims to (i) \nundertake an assessment and situation analysis of crop straw usage and management; (ii) \nevaluate policies, incentive structures, and mechanisms that contribute to the lack of social capital \nfor  efficient  resource  use  and  clean  energy  development;  (iii)  summarize  domestic  and \ninternational best practices and technologies for the effective reuse of crop straw; (iv) propose \nnew models for the effective reuse of crop straw tailored to the PRC context; and identify the \nnecessary financial, institutional, and market requirements to pursue these technologies; and (v) \nprepare policy recommendations and action plans for provincial and national governments on \nhow to effectively use rural organic waste for agriculture and clean energy development purposes. \n \n11.  Output 3: Knowledge and understanding of key constraints to, and priorities for, \nrural vitalization in Qinghai Province generated. The PRC\u2019s rural vitalization policy aims to \nmodernize agriculture and ensure the sustainable development of rural areas. This output aims \nto support the Qinghai provincial government in pursuing the Strategic Plan for Rural Vitalization, \n2018\u20132022. Specifically, this output will (i) generate new knowledge on the key constraints to \nrural  vitalization  in  Qinghai  and  propose  recommendations  for  addressing  challenges  in \nagriculture modernization, environmental protection, rural\u2013urban integration, rural infrastructure \nand service delivery, and governance and/or institutional challenges; and (ii) develop strategies \nand  technical  recommendations  on  how  to  promote  livable  ecological  villages  in  Qinghai, \naddressing issues such as solid waste and wastewater management. This output will include \nrecommendations on how to improve coordination within provincial government agencies and \nbetween provincial and national agencies for the purposes of rural vitalization. \n \n12.  Lessons learned. Previous projects indicated that involving senior government officials, \nconcerned government agencies, and local experts in TA work and inviting their input to draft \nreports and review workshops are important to ensure quality outputs that meet the needs of \nvarious agencies. Greater benefits can be gained from policy research if dissemination is planned \nmore strategically and the findings and recommendations that may be relevant to other provinces \nin similar situations are highlighted. \n \n13.  Strategic fit. The TA will support the PRC in implementing its Strategic Plan for Rural \nVitalization, 2018\u20132022, and promoting the sustainable development of agriculture and the \necological protection of vital natural resources. The design of this TA supports the ADB Strategy \n2030  operational  priorities  on  promoting  rural  development  and  food  security  and  on \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity, and the Operational Plan for Agriculture and \nNatural Resources: Promoting Sustainable Food Security in Asia and the Pacific in 2015\u20132020.7 \nThe TA is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC and supports \nthe government\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, which aims to promote environment-friendly \nrural development and the sustainable use of natural resources.8 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $900,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n7  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila; and ADB. 2015.
