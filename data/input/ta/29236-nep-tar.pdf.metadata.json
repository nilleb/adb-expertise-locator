INTRODUCTION\n1. The Government of Nepal requested the Bank to provide project preparatory\ntechnical assistance (TA) during the Country Programming Mission in 1996, to formulate a\ncommunity groundwater irrigation project. A Bank Fact-Finding Mission visited Nepal from 17 to\n29 March 1996 and held discussions with representatives of the Government, including the\nNational Planning Commission, the Nepal Rastra Bank, Agricultural Development Bank, Grameen\nBank-Nepal Biratnagar, as well as external agencies such as the United States Agency for\nInternational Development, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the World Bank.\nIt also held discussions with nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and prospective beneficiaries.\nThe Mission confirmed the need for the TA and reached an understanding with the Government\non the scope, cost estimates, financing plan, terms of reference, and implementation\narrangements for the TA1.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Groundwater irrigation has been used in the Terai 2 for a long time. Assessments\nof the groundwater resources confirm the large potential to expand its use for irrigation 3. The\nGovernment has recently endorsed the Agriculture Perspective Plan (APP) 4 which was prepared\nwith assistanc\u00e9from the Bank as a guideline for agricultural development. The APP specifies that\ngroundwater irrigation will be the focus of the irrigation strategy in the Terai. There is also scope\nfor improving the existing surface schemes; however, only a small portion of these schemes will\nprovide the year-round water control that is essential to the rapid increase in agricultural\nproduction specified in the APP.\n3. The construction costs per unit command area of shallow tubewells (STWs) 5 and\ndeep tubewells (DTWs)6 are lower than those of surface irrigation schemes and the\nmanagement is easier because the operations and water users groups are smaller. The total\ngroundwater irrigation area is expected to increase from 107,000 hectares (ha) in 1991/92 to\n612,000 ha at the end of the APP in 2015. The APP estimated that 726,000 ha have a high\npotential to benefit from S1Ws and another 305,000 ha have a marginal potential. An additional\n190,000 ha have the potential to benefit from DTWs. The APP calls for an average of 24,000 ha\na year to be added to the groundwater irrigated area (STWs: 22,000 ha, DTW: 2,000 ha). Ninety\npercent of the total investment requirement in the APP would be allocated for STWs.\n4. Of the two agencies responsible for groundwater irrigation, the Agricultural\nDevelopment Bank of Nepal (ADBN) specializes in manually drilled STWs, while the Department\nof Irrigation (DOl) handles D1Ws and rig-drilled STWs. Other relevant agencies are the\nDepartment of Agriculture (DOA), the Nepal Agricultural Research Council (NARC), the\nThe TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities in March 1996.\n2\t The Terai is the flat subtropical area in the southern part of Nepal.\nShallow Groundwater Investigations in the Terai, UNDP/HMGN NEP/86/02, March 1992.\nReassessment of the Groundwater Development Strategy for Irrigation in the Terai, HMGN/GDC, April 1994.\nThe Master Plan Study on the Terai Groundwater Resources Evaluation and Development Project for\nIrrigation, JICA/DOl, March 1995.\nTA 1854-NEP: Agriculture Perspective Plan, for $600000, approved on 15 March 1993.\nShallow tubewells are characterized by a surface mounted pump. Their application is limited to areas with\na static water table level within 7 meters (m) from the surface (maximum suction depth). Drilling depths,\nhowever, usually vary between 10 m and 80 m depending on local hydrogeologic conditions.\nDeep tubewells are characterized by deep set pumps. Based on economic considerations, the static\ngroundwater table should not be below 10 m and drilling depths should generally not exceed 150 m.\n- .", "Agricultural Inputs Corporation (AIC), the Grameen Bank-Nepal Biratnagar, the Department of\nWater Supply and Sewerage (DWSS), and the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA). Recently, there\nhas been a rapid growth of both national and international NGOs in Nepal, some of which have\nbeen involved in groundwater irrigation development.\n5. The present water resources legislation is general and a regulatory system for\ngroundwater resources does not exist. However, the groundwater table is monitored. The\ndevelopment effort envisaged in the APP will require the monitoring of groundwater use and\nadministration of water rights at the local and national levels. Consequently, the Government has\ncommenced to revise the existing water resources legislation.\n6. The Bank has financed credit programs for STWs through ADBN under several\nloan projects1. The World Bank, JICA, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),\nand several other aid agencies have also financed groundwater development projects. The\nGrameen Bank-Nepal Biratnagar, formed in 1992, is implementing a group based groundwater\nirrigation program in the Eastern Development Region.\n7. Under the Bank-assisted projects, the role of ADBN has been limited to a technical\nassessment of proposed subprojects and an evaluation of the borrowers capability to repay.\nFollowing the Government's current groundwater irrigation policy, the subprojects receive a\nsubsidy (40 percent for individually owned wells and 75 percent for group wells). Important\naspects of the Bank-financed projects implemented by ADBN are that (I) the subprojects are\nbased on demand, (ii) the subproject evaluation and approval relies on minimal, but effective\ninputs, and (iii) the construction is undertaken by private contractors and beneficiaries. However,\nto improve cost recovery, groundwater irrigation projects need to be made more effective and\nincrease cash income faster than the current operations.\n8. The lessons learned from completed, Bank-financed groundwater irrigation\nprojects in Nepal pertain mainly to the social and institutional aspects and to the issues of\nsustainability, servicing, and maintenance2. These projects have already demonstrated that DOl\nhas the technical capability to undertake groundwater irrigation development. On the other hand,\nthey generally only benefitted farmers with larger landholdings since the selection criteria applied\nby ADBN and the collateral requirements for subloans resulted in the exclusion of most smaller\nlandholders. Under the proposed community approach, the issues of land fragmentation and\nsmall landholders as the target clientele can be addressed and resource poor farmers and\ntenants will be able to participate. In addition, extension services, infrastructure, and support from\nthe private sector can be targeted better at the selected communities, which will improve the\nproduction systems faster and permit cost recovery. Water user groups for groundwater irrigation\nhave already been used under the Irrigation Line of Credit Project financed by the World Bank.\nIn addition, lessons can be learned from the Bank's experience with surface irrigation systems\nand drinking water supplies. Elsewhere, the possibility of more efficient operations and cost\nLoan No. 1112-NEP (SF): Sixth Agricultural Credit, for $35.0 million, approved on 31 October 1991 and five\nearlier loans to ADBN.\nThe lessons learned from the Bank's involvement have been analyzed in (i) Sector Synthesis of Post\nEvaluation Findings in the Irrigation and Rural Development Sector, May 1995, and (ii) An Impact Evaluation\nStudy of Bank Operations in the Irrigation Sector in Nepal, September 1994.", "3\nrecovery through the effective preparation of subprojects and support from the private sector has\nalready been demonstrated'.\n9. The APP identified four requirements for the development of groundwater\nirrigation. First, a road network is generally necessary to provide access to drill tubewells, as well\nas to high-intensity agricultural inputs and marketing. Second, development cannot proceed\nwithout the farmers receiving training in the operation of pumpsets and the availability of service\nfacilities. Third, a credit system and an investment subsidy are required. Fourth, farming systems\nneed to be developed and information on them needs to be disseminated to the farmers so they\ncan use tubewells effectively. The development of tubewells will also benefit from rural\nelectrification because it will lower costs of investment and of operation and maintenance.\n10. The proposed expansion of groundwater development needs to be supported by\nthe sector policies in the APP such as (i) improving access for small landholders to groundwater\nirrigation and appropriate farming systems technology, (ii) organizing communities to ensure\ntheir participation in the design and implementation of projects, (iii) improving cost recovery, (iv)\nincreasing the involvement of the private sector, (v) improving access to services such as\nmarketing information, extension, credit, and farm inputs, (vi) improving infrastructure, and (vii)\nestablishing effective monitoring systems and regulations, as necessary.\n11. The role of Government would increasingly be limited to facilitation, coordination,\nand quality control, while the private sector would increasingly become involved in\nimplementation. The areas targeted for involvement by the private sector would include drilling,\nprovision and installation of pump sets, and operation and maintenance. The opportunity exists\nto improve the choice of technology for drilling operations, pump sets, maintenance, and farming\nsystems as well as water distribution systems. NGOs could have an important role in organizing\nthe communities and in training.\n12. DO l's extensive experience with the completed first phase of the Irrigation Line of\nCredit Project financed by the World Bank and other completed and ongoing projects related\nto groundwater irrigation, and ADBN's technical approaches under the Bank-financed projects,\nprovide a suitable framework for intensified groundwater irrigation development. The TA will build\non these experiences by encouraging participation of both the communities and the private\nsector through a process approach. The TA will assist in designing a project to support the\nchanges necessary during the interim period before a self-reliant, private sector emerges. While\nindividual ownership of tubewells will continue, a group approach will be explored to improve\naccess to credit and services for small landholders. The Government has given high priority to\nthe development of groundwater irrigation and has requested TA from the Bank to prepare a\ncommunity groundwater irrigation sector project, covering an aggregate area of about 20,000\nha over six years, and suitable for financing as a sector loan.\nIII. THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n13. The TA is designed to prepare a Community Groundwater Irrigation Sector Project\nin the Terai covering eleven districts in the Central Development Region and the Eastern\nLoan No. 1125-BAN (SF): Northeast Minor Irrigation Project, for $73.0 million, approved on 21 November\n1991.", "4\nDevelopment Region.1 The TA will determine the general scope of the project, its cost, operation\nand maintenance procedures, and implementation arrangements as well as the measures\nrequired to ensure that the project is socially and environmentally sound.\nB.\t Scope\n14. Using a process approach through workshops and intensive field investigations,\nthe scope of the TA will include a review of the existing groundwater irrigation projects to\ndetermine the: (i) selection criteria for target areas and individual subprojects; (ii) social\nstrategies for community groundwater irrigation development as well as the extent of beneficiary\nparticipation and their willingness to pay for different groundwater development options; (iii)\ninstitutional development needs at the village, district, regional, and central levels; (iv) support\nrequirement for private drilling operations, pump operators, and contractors; and (v) most\neconomic and appropriate technologies for specific environments and markets that will allow for\nfull cost recovery. The TA will also review and make recommendations concerning the\ngroundwater resources strategy and the administration of water rights at both the local level and\nthe national level.\n15. Based on the information obtained, the TA will propose: (i) a cost-effective\napproach for increasing groundwater irrigation coverage through a mix of subprojects and\ntechnologies; (ii) an investment program including a prioritized longlist of potential project sites;\n(iii) six sample projects at already identified sites; (iv) a program of policy changes including the\nissues of groundwater irrigation subsidies, institutional development, and capacity building; and\n(v) an effective monitoring and evaluation system. It is envisaged that, eventually, an accelerated,\nsustainable tubewell program led by the private sector will develop, which the Government will\nsupport through the activities of its line agencies. The terms of reference for the consultants are\nin Appendix 1.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $755,000 equivalent comprising $384, 100\nin foreign exchange costs and $370,900 in local currency cost. The TA will be financed by the\nBank on a grant basis, and cover the entire foreign exchange cost as well as $215,900\nequivalent of the local currency cost, for a total of $600,000. The remaining local currency cost\nof $155,000 will be financed by the Government from its own resources. The detailed cost\nestimates are in Appendix 2. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does\nnot commit the Bank to finance an ensuing project.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n17. The TA will be carried out over six months, and will be completed by the end of\nMarch 1997. It will require about 42 person-months of consulting services (14 person-months -\ninternational and 28 person-months - domestic). Expertise will be required in institutional and\ncommunity development2, financial and economic analysis, irrigation engineering and irrigated\nagriculture, marketing and credit, hydrogeology, drilling technology and pumps, and\nenvironmental and legal aspects. The selection of an international consulting firm, which will\nliaise with a domestic firm, will follow the simplified technical proposal procedure.\nThe World Bank is currently preparing the second phase of the Irrigation Line of Credit project, which will\ntarget the Western Development and the Far Western Development Region.\nAn expert in community and institutional development will be the team leader.", "5\n18. DOI will be the Executing Agency for the TA. It will coordinate the day to day\nimplementation of the TA with DOA through the already established coordination committee of\nthe two departments. The Government will appoint a Project Manager for overall management\nand coordination of the TA. A Technical Assistance Advisory Committee (TAAC) will be\nestablished under the chairmanship of the Director General of DOl to review the progress of the\nTA in the first, third, and fifth months and assist in its implementation. The members of the TAAC\nwill include representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, DOA, ADBN, Grameen\nBank-Nepal Biratnagar, NARC, DWSS, and NEA. The Government will assign two senior staff\nfrom DOl and one senior staff each from DOA and from ADBN as well as six officers at the\nproposed sites to work with the consultants under the TA.\n19. The TA will be carried out in five stages in accordance with the terms of reference\nin Appendix 1. Stage 1 (about six weeks) will involve an evaluation of completed groundwater\nirrigation projects and a survey of the status of groundwater irrigation in the area to be covered\nby a future investment project. Under Stage 2 (about one week including preparation and\nreporting), a workshop will be held to review the findings of Stage 1, to discuss policy aspects\nand institutional concerns, and to propose the strategies and the details of the intensive field\ninvestigations to be carried out under Stage 3 (about eight weeks), which will prepare five STW\nsample subprojects and one DTW sample subproject. Under Stage 4 (about one week), a\nsecond workshop and midterm review will be conducted to review findings of the field\ninvestigations and to discuss the approaches, scope, and implementation arrangements for the\ninvestment project to be prepared during Stage 5 (about eight weeks).\n20. The field investigations to be undertaken at the six already identified sites will lay\nthe foundation for sample subprojects to be financed under a future investment project. A local\nNGO will be engaged by the consulting firm to assist in the field investigations, the participatory\nrural appraisal (PRA) process, and policy studies.\n21. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants and arrangements satisfactory to the Bank. The equipment will be procured\nby the consultants in accordance with arrangements acceptable to the Bank. The equipment will\nbe retained by DOl upon completion of the TA. The consultants will prepare brief monthly\nprogress reports. The main reports will consist of an inception report at the end of Stage 1, a\nmidterm report at the end of stage 3, a draft final report after five months, and a final report.\nTripartite meetings will be held one week after receipt by the Bank of the inception, midterm, and\ndraft final reports.\nIV.
