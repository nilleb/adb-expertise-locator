INTRODUCTION \n1.  The extent of environmental change in Asia over the past 20 years has been dramatic \nand presents enormous challenges.  Many environmental issues are not sufficiently covered by \npolicy and regulatory frameworks. If they have been adopted as laws, they often have not been \ntranslated into national, provincial, and local implementing rules and regulations. Even where \nAsian countries have adequate policy, legal, and regulatory frameworks, still more work is \nrequired to ensure effective implementation, enforcement, and compliance.   \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) recognizes these challenges in its Strategy 2020.1 \nThe strategy calls for ADB to strengthen environmental regulatory frameworks and enforcement \ncapacities of public institutions. It recognizes good governance and capacity development as \ndrivers  of  change  to  improve  regional  public  goods such  as  environmental  quality.  It  also \npromotes regional cooperation. Moreover, in June 2009, ADB adopted a new Safeguard Policy \nStatement  that  prioritizes  stronger  country  environmental  safeguard  systems  by  boosting \nregulation and enforcement.      \n \n3.  To help support these strategic priorities, in December 2009 ADB approved small-scale \ntechnical assistance (TA)2 under which, in July 2010, it and UNEP held the Asian Judges\u2019 \nSymposium on Environmental Decision Making, the Rule of Law, and Environmental Justice \n(2010  Symposium).  The  symposium  gathered  about  120  chief  justices,  senior  judges  and \nministry of environment officials to consider how to bolster judicial capacity for environmental \nenforcement. Participants proposed the Asian Judges Network on the Environment (AJNE) to \nimprove the quality of court rulings on environmental and natural resource cases, and achieve \neffective enforcement of environmental law in the region, supported by two subregional groups \nnamely the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the South Asian Association \nfor Regional Cooperation (SAARC). During the 2010 Symposium, the chief justice of Pakistan, \nthrough his representatives, offered to host, in 2011, a regional roundtable for SAARC chief \njustices to gather momentum for environmental enforcement, and the chief justice of Indonesia \nmade  a  similar  offer  for  ASEAN  countries.  This  TA  supports  Strategy  2020\u2019s  priorities  of \nenvironment, regional cooperation, through governance improvements, to drive strengthened \nenvironmental systems3. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The chief justices and senior judiciary have a direct and indirect influence on the legal \nsystem  and  environmental  enforcement:  they  shape  normative  interpretations  of  legal  and \nregulatory frameworks, they issue rules and directions that affect lower courts\u2019 priorities, and \nthey play a role in judicial education. Such influence affects not only the courts but also the \noverall perceptions of the rule of law in the country and, hence, influences private sector \ninvestment in related sectors.  \n \n5.  Effective judicial participation in ensuring environmental justice and the rule of law also \ndepends on other stakeholders doing their part in promoting environmental governance. Thus, \nstrengthening judicial capacity also requires supporting various stakeholders responsible for \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20142020. \nManila. \n2  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Strengthening of Judicial Capacity to Adjudicate Upon Environmental Laws \nand Regulations. Manila (TA 7474-REG). \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 September 2010. \n ", "2  \nenvironmental  governance.  Equally,  in  ensuring  environmental  justice,  there  is  a  need  to \nencourage the demand side by shoring up civil society, which plays an important role in making \njustice accessible to the poor through its work in legal rights awareness.  \n \n6.  Judges and prosecutors participating in the 2010 Symposium agreed on several key \nmessages, including that (i) ensuring effective compliance and enforcement of environmental \nlaw  requires  the  entire  environmental  compliance  and  enforcement  chain  to  be  effective, \n(ii) judges play a unique role, (iii) and expanding access to environmental justice involves both \nthe formal justice system and informal ways to resolve disputes.\u00a0This TA seeks to respond to \nthe key messages from the 2010 Symposium, and the ongoing work under the 2009 TA.  \n \n7.  Global  and  regional  developments. In 2002, UNEP convened the Global Judges \nSymposium, at which participants committed to the Johannesburg Principles on the Role of Law \nand Sustainable Development (the principles). The principles committed judges to contribute to \nthe realization of sustainable development by using their judicial mandate to implement, develop, \nand enforce the law, and to uphold the rule of law and democratic processes. Judges also \nagreed  that  judicial  education  and  training  on  environmental  law  through  regional  and \nsubregional initiatives is urgently needed, and that judges need to collaborate within and across \nregions  to  improve  enforcement,  compliance  and  implementation  of  environmental  law. \nImportantly, the principles view not just the judicial role as critical, but the whole chain of \nenvironmental enforcement and other environmental legal actors.  \n \n8.  Building  upon  these  developments,  in  2002  and  again  in  2003,  ADB  published  a \ncompilation of training materials that had been used for a series of \u201ctrain the trainers\u201d workshops \nfor academics and members of the legal profession in the region. In 2004, ADB funded a \nJudges\u2019 Forum on Environmental Protection in the Philippines, and in August 2005, ADB and \nthe United States Agency for International Development launched the Asian Environmental \nCompliance  and  Enforcement  Network  (AECEN)\u2014a  regional  network  of  environment \nministries\u2014to begin promoting better enforcement of and compliance with environmental law in \nAsia and the Pacific.   \n \n9.  National developments. Several Southeast Asian countries have taken various formal \nsteps to strengthen and institutionalize environmental decision making within the judiciary and \nlegal profession. In the Philippines, in 2008, the chief justice designated 117 environmental \ncourts,  and  in  2010,  the  Supreme  Court  adopted  environmental  rules  to  make  access  to \nenvironmental justice easier. In Thailand, in 2009, the president of the Supreme Court issued a \ncourt resolution establishing a judicial committee to prepare a draft law on better environmental \nadjudication. \n \n10.  Since 1998, Indonesia has trained 20% of its judiciary in environmental law. The Ministry \nof Environment (MOE-I) has also signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the \nSupreme  Court  to  establish  a  program  to  certify  judges  as  \u201cenvironmental  judges\u201d  upon \ncompletion of  a  series  of  trainings.  ADB,  under  the  2009  TA,  has  been  working  with  the \nSupreme Court and MOE-I to prepare the basis for the certification scheme, but it is envisaged \nthat further work will be needed to ensure its implementation. Moreover, MOE-I, the attorney \ngeneral and the national police chief of Indonesia have entered into a separate MOU to widen \naccess  to environmental  justice. The  purpose  of  this  MOU  is  to  strengthen  environmental \ngovernance in Indonesia and improve access to environmental justice by strengthening the \ncapacity and integrity of prosecutors and adjudicators. The challenge in these countries, and \nothers in Southeast Asia, is to ensure that formal pronouncements and intent are implemented, \nand the entire environmental enforcement chain becomes effective.  \n ", "  3\n \n11.  Over the past 20 years, SAARC countries have acknowledged the role of the judiciary in \nenvironmental  law  enforcement.  India\u2019s  environmental  jurisprudence  is  characterized  by \ninnovations  that  introduce  international  environmental  law  principles  into  decisions  and \nconstitutional interpretations. Environmental jurisprudence in Bangladesh has been similarly \nprogressive and environmental courts have been established in two districts along with an \nenvironmental appellate court.     \n \n12.  In Pakistan, prior to the Environmental Protection Act, 1997, environmental enforcement \ndepended on decisions of the higher judiciary through public interest litigation, which means that \nunless a case was brought before the judges, it was not considered a violation; moreover, in \norder to establish a violation, principles of natural justice were relied upon. The 1997 act \nenabled  the  designation  of  environmental  magistrates  and  mandated  the  creation  of \nenvironmental tribunals, which are now functioning in most of its provinces. Any violation of \nenvironmental principles is now considered a violation of law. The challenge in South Asia, like \nin Southeast Asia, remains to ensure that support of senior judges is institutionalized, and that \nthe capacity of lower courts is strengthened.  \n \n13.  Based on the offer of the chief justices of Indonesia and Pakistan, this TA will provide \nsystematic  and  timely  support  tailored  to  the  needs  of  the  judiciary,  prosecutors,  and law \nenforcement officials in two pilot countries: Indonesia (through ASEAN) and Pakistan (through \nSAARC).  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of this initiative will be better prepared and adjudicated environmental cases \nin ASEAN and SAARC countries.  \n \n15.  The  outcome  will  be  refined  environmental  law  prosecution,  adjudication,  and \nenforcement systems in the two pilot countries. This outcome will be achieved by ensuring that \naccess  to  environmental  justice  is  increased  by  strengthening  environmental  compliance, \nadjudication, dispute resolution, and the enforcement chain. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  This TA will involve regional, subregional, and national activities.  Regionally, the TA will \ndevelop AJNE by fostering subregional work through two proposed groups within SAARC and \nASEAN. Nationally, the TA will support needs-based activities in the pilot countries to ensure \nthat the systems for access to justice are fortified and integrated. The TA will build on past work \nby ADB to boost capacity for environmental law and also capitalize on work conducted by \ndevelopment partners to reinforce environmental compliance and enforcement.   \n \n17.  Output 1 \u2013 Regional and subregional: increased knowledge of adjudication and \nenforcement  of  environmental  law  through  a  judicial  network  and  sharing  of  good \npractices. This output will help ADB and its development partners establish and strengthen a \njudicial network for continual sharing of environmental cases, information, and best practices. \nAlthough there is an established network of Asian environment ministries (AECEN), a separate \nand specialized judges\u2019 network is called for since the judiciary is a separate, co-equal branch of \nthe government, bound by a more stringent code of conduct, i.e., neutrality and confidentiality \n ", "4  \nthat may not be understood by non-judges. Thus, in sharing information and experience, a \nspecialized judges\u2019 network, parallel to the ministers\u2019 network (AECEN), is an ideal set-up to \nprovide systematic and timely support tailored to the needs of the judiciary. Endorsement and \nownership of AJNE, including a proposal for a rotating national chair supported by a small \npermanent secretariat, will be sought from regional judges. Activities under this output include (i) \nhosting the second Asian Judges\u2019 Symposium in conjunction with ADB\u2019s development partners, \nto  continue  sharing  best  practices  and  report  on  developments;  (ii)  establishing  an  AJNE \nwebsite to offer training and other analytical material on building capacity of judges to decide \nenvironmental cases; and (iii) holding at least one subregional roundtable in each pilot country \nfor  higher  courts,  subordinate  courts,  prosecutors  and  law  enforcement  officials,  attorneys \ngeneral, and other legal professionals to boost capacity through knowledge sharing. \n \n18.  Output 2 \u2013 National: results from integrated environmental enforcement pilots in \nIndonesia and Pakistan disseminated. This output will help ADB and its partners provide \nsystematic  and  timely  support  tailored  to  the  needs  of  the  judiciary,  prosecutors,  and law \nenforcement officials in the pilot countries.  Activities under this component will include: \n \n(i) Pakistan. The TA will support judicial capacity building in environmental adjudication \nby conducting a needs assessment in collaboration with the Supreme Court, federal \nand  provincial  judicial  academies,  and  environmental  tribunals.  Based  on  the \nassessment,  an  environmental  law  program  will  be  developed  or  broadened  and \nintegrated in the judicial academies\u2019 curriculum. In coordination with chief justices of \nthe supreme court and provincial high courts, the TA will also look into the possibility of \nestablishing  green  benches  (selected  teams  of  judges  with  experience  in \nenvironmental adjudication from within the existing judiciary to act as an environmental \nbench) for each of the four provinces. Once the green benches have been specified, \nthey will be trained in environmental law and enforcement. The TA will also strengthen \nenvironmental libraries for the green benches.  \n \n(ii) Indonesia. Good environmental governance requires that the three access rights\u2014\naccess to information and justice, and public participation\u2014embodied in Principle 10 of \nthe Rio Declaration be made the pillars of decision- and policymaking in promoting \nenvironmental governance. Thus, this TA will support work for both the formal and \ninformal justice systems to ensure that access rights are strengthened and enforced. \nThe TA will help cement access to environmental justice by continuing to work with the \njudiciary on the environmental judicial certification program and by supporting the \npiloting  (possibly  in  two  areas,  Kalimantan  and  Makassar)  of  an  integrated \nenforcement  system  involving  MOE-I,  the  attorney  general,  and  law  enforcement \nagencies. The pilot integrated enforcement system will also build the capacity of civil \nsociety  to  raise  legal  rights  awareness  within  the  community  and  foster  public \nparticipation in environmental issues.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The  estimated  cost  of  the  TA  is  $1,020,000  equivalent,  of  which  ADB  will  finance  \n$500,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  its  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF\u2014IV)  and \n$500,000 from the Regional Cooperation Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \n ", "  5\nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility.4 The remaining $20,000 is expected to be financed in \nkind by the governments of the pilot countries. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB will be the executing agency, through the Office of the General Counsel, which will \nwork  closely  with  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department,  Southeast  Asia \nDepartment, and Central and West Asia Department, as necessary to ensure full coordination. \nThe implementing agencies for activities in Pakistan will be the Pakistan branch of IUCN and for \nactivities  in  Indonesia,  MOE-I.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  close  partnership  with  the \nsupreme  courts,  high  courts,  environmental  tribunals,  and  national  prosecution  and  law \nenforcement  offices  in  the  pilot  countries.  ADB  will  also  continue  its  work  with  other \ndevelopment partners, such as AECEN, the Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in \nCommerce,  UNEP,  the  United  States  Environmental  Protection  Agency,  and  the  World \nResources Institute.5    \n \n21.  ADB will recruit 24 person-months of international consultant services for the overall \nmanagement of the TA and 117 person-months of national consultants\u2014two consultants for \neach pilot country, and one coordinator and one IT specialist for AJNE. The consultants will be \ncontracted by ADB using the individual selection method in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The individual selection \nmethod is chosen because (i) it is considered to be more economical and efficient for the TA, \n(ii) it is very hard to find firms specializing in environmental law and enforcement in the pilot \ncountries, and (iii) the experience and qualification of the consultants is a primary consideration \nin the selection. Procurement will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time) and the procured items will be handed over to the pilot \ncountries upon TA completion. Disbursement will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n22.  Implementation progress will be monitored through (i) ADB's inception, interim, and final \nreview  missions;  (ii)  workshops  and  seminars;  and  (iii)  draft  and  final  project  reports  and \npublications. The findings under the TA will be disseminated through workshops, seminars, and \ndisclosure of the final reports on the websites of ADB and its development partners. The           \nTA will be implemented over 3 years, from January 2011 to December 2013. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor  Building  Capacity  for  Environmental  Prosecution,  Adjudication,  Dispute  Resolution, \nCompliance, and Enforcement in Asia, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n                                                 \n4 Established by ADB. \n5 No activities will be initiated in the pilot countries until no objection is received from the respective governments.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources and \nDesign  Performance Targets  Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nSummary  and/or Indicators Mechanisms  \nImpact      Assumption \nBetter prepared and  Higher percentage of  Published court  Better understanding of the \nadjudicated  cases involving  decisions  technical side of \nenvironmental  environmental issues    environmental issues will help \ncases in ASEAN  and reaching court is  Environmental  the judiciary make more \nand SAARC  successfully  protection agencies\u2019  informed decisions in cases \ncountries  adjudicated compared  statistics and reports in  requiring environmental \n  with the 2009/2010  pilot countries  compliance and enforcement. \nbaseline.     \n    Risk \n  Excessively activist courts \ncould hold up industry \ninvestment and push \ninvestors into less regulated \ncountries. \nOutcome  Refined procedures for  Consultants\u2019 report and  Assumption \nSelected  collecting technical  draft rules    Environmental law enforcers \nenvironmental law  evidence    and adjudicators support an \nprosecution,      integrated implementation \nadjudication, and  Use by the judiciary of  Published court  approach. \nenforcement  environmental  decisions   \nsystems refined in  principles, laws, and     \nthe pilot countries  instruments as the   \n  basis for their   \n  decisions (and not just   \nuse of general   \nprinciples of law, i.e.,   \ncivil liabilities,   \ndamages)   \n   \nRevised rules on  Draft rules on integrated \nintegrated enforcement  enforcement system \nof environmental cases   \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
