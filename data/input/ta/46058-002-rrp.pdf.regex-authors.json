I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Qinghai Delingha Concentrated Solar Thermal \nPower Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will construct a 50-megawatt (MW) concentrated solar thermal power (CSP) \nplant in the city of Delingha, Qinghai Province. It is the first-of-its-kind CSP demonstration plant \nin the PRC. Upon completion, the project will generate 197 gigawatt-hours of clean electricity \nannually, thereby avoiding 154,446 tons of carbon dioxide (CO ) per year.2  \n2\n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The power sector in the PRC has grown rapidly in tandem with economic growth. \nInstalled power capacity has expanded by about 70% in the past 5 years (2008\u20132012) alone.3 \nSince the power sector relies heavily on coal-fired power generation, which supplied more than \n75% of the electricity in the PRC in 2012, the rapid expansion in capacity has also caused a \nlarge increase in CO  emission\u2014the key greenhouse gas responsible for climate change.4 \n2\nPromoting a more diversified energy mix with a higher share of renewable energy is a core \npriority to decarbonize the country\u2019s power sector. In 2005, the PRC\u2019s Renewable Energy Law \nwas enacted to stimulate large-scale renewable energy development. It was accompanied by a \nset of incentives and policy measures to promote non-hydro renewable technologies. In 2007, \nthe  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  issued  the  Medium  and  Long-Term \nDevelopment Plan for Renewable Energy in the PRC to increase the share of renewable energy \nin the total primary energy consumption to 15% by 2020. In 2009, the PRC also announced its \ntarget to reduce its carbon intensity (the amount of greenhouse gas emissions per unit of gross \ndomestic product) by 40%\u201345% by 2020 compared with 2005 levels. The Twelfth Five-Year \nPlan, 2011\u20132015 set an intermediate target to increase the share of renewable energy to \n11.4%5 and to reduce carbon intensity by 17%6 by 2015 compared with 2010 levels.  \n \n4.  During the Eleventh Five-Year Plan period (2006\u20132010), the PRC achieved rapid growth \nin wind power and solar photovoltaic capacity. During this period, the installed capacity of wind \npower  increased  from  1.3  gigawatts  (GW)  to  41.8  GW,  and  solar  photovoltaic  capacity \nincreased from 70 MW to 900 MW. The Twelfth Five-Year Plan set a target of 21 GW of solar \nphotovoltaic capacity; by 2012, the total solar photovoltaic capacity surged to 3.2 GW. The rapid \ngrowth of wind power and solar photovoltaic capacity poses new challenges for grid integration \nof the intermittent power supplied by these plants. Since the electricity output of these plants \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2012. Technical \nAssistance to the People's Republic of China for Preparing the Qinghai Delingha Concentrated Solar Thermal Plant \nProject. Manila. \n3  National Energy Administration. 2013. Report on China\u2019s Energy Development for 2013. Beijing: Economic \nScience Press.  \n4  According to International Energy Agency (2012), CO  emission from the power sector in the PRC accounts for \n2\naround 50% of total CO  emission in the PRC.  \n2\n5  Share of renewable energy in the total primary consumption has steadily expanded from 6.95% (or 197 million tons \nof standard coal equivalent) in 2007 to 10.3% (or 378 million tons of standard coal equivalent) in 2012.  \n6  Carbon intensity (kilogram of CO /CNY) decreased from 0.28 in 2005 to 0.24 in 2010, which is about a 14.2% \n2\nreduction as compared with 2005 levels.  ", "2 \ncannot be predicted accurately, the grid company finds it extremely difficult to schedule their \noutput dispatch economically, and this is causing grid curtailment.7 \n \n5.  CSP  is  a  state-of-the-art  renewable  energy  technology  that  converts  direct  normal \nirradiation (DNI) into usable heat, generating medium- to high-temperature saturated steam that \nruns the steam turbine for power generation. Because of this thermal cycle, CSP plants can be \ncombined easily with low-cost thermal energy storage, allowing it to generate electricity even at \nnight. Thus, CSP plants produce reliable, predictable, and dispatchable electricity at any time of \nthe day to allow the grid company to schedule their dispatch economically. This unique feature \nenables  it  to  overcome  grid  integration  issues  posed  by  unpredictable  wind  and  solar \nphotovoltaic plants. In 2012, more than 2.4 GW capacity of utility-scale CSP plants were in \noperation and additional 2.36 GW capacity plants are under construction, mainly in Spain and \nthe United States.8  \n \n6.  The CSP plants typically require DNI of at least 1,800 kilowatt-hours per square meter \n(kWh/m2) per year. Based on this requirement, more than 700,000 square kilometers is suitable \nfor CSP installation in the PRC, which can potentially generate more than 51,000 terawatt-hours \nof electricity per year compared to its total electricity generation of 4,980 terawatt-hours in \n2012.9 But CSP development has been rather slow in the PRC because of many factors, such \nas  the  (i) limited  in-country  manufacturing  capacity,  (ii)  higher  capital  cost  of  CSP  plants, \n(iii) negligible hands-on experience with the technology, (iv) location of suitable sites far from \npopulation  centers,  and  (v)  extreme  cold  weather.  Thus,  CSP  development  has  been \nlanguishing in the PRC, undermining the substantial potential benefits this technology can \nprovide to decarbonize the PRC\u2019s power mix. The lack of a CSP-specific development policy, in \nparticular  the  absence  of  a  feed-in  tariff  for  CSP  technologies,  has  inhibited  or  slowed \ninvestment thereby causing further delays in CSP demonstration and deployment.10 \n \n7.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been promoting CSP in the PRC since 2009 \nthrough capacity development technical assistance (TA).11 The successful implementation of \nthe TA lowered the barriers for demonstrating CSP in the PRC. In 2011, the Government of the \nPRC decided to construct four utility-scale CSP demonstration projects. The proposed project is \none of these four.12 These demonstration projects will provide valuable hands-on experience \nand mitigate some of the perceived and real technology risks associated with first-of-its-kind \n                                                 \n7  Grid curtailment refers to the non-absorption of electricity generated from power plants by the power grid. Solar \nphotovoltaic and wind power generation above a threshold such as 20% requires increased grid flexibility to fully \nutilize the variable and uncertain output from these plants. In addition, the PRC\u2019s interregional grid interconnection \nis relatively underdeveloped, which constrains wind power utilization in concentrated areas such as Inner Mongolia \nAutonomous Region, causing the curtailment of wind power as high as 45% compared to less than 10% in Europe. \n8  Utility-scale refers to grid-connected CSP plants with an installed capacity of 10 MW or higher. Spain and the \nUnited States offer some of the best sites for CSP installation.  \n9  ADB. 2011. Concentrating Solar Thermal Power Development. Consultant\u2019s final report. Manila (TA 7402-PRC). \n10 A solar feed-in tariff of CNY1.0 per kilowatt-hour was introduced in 2011, which targeted solar photovoltaic plants. \nThis feed-in tariff does not reflect the unique benefits of CSP (para. 5) and does not provide incentives to \naccelerate investment in CSP. The government is contemplating issuing a feed-in tariff for CSP within 2014.  \n11 ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Concentrating Solar Thermal Power \nDevelopment. Manila (TA 7402-PRC). The TA has (i) developed a road map for CSP plant development in Gansu \nand  Qinghai  provinces,  (ii)  prepared  a  pre-feasibility  study  for  a  CSP  project  in  Gansu  province,  and \n(iii) implemented a 1 MW CSP pilot project in Beijing. \n12 The other three projects are (i) a 50 MW parabolic trough CSP in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, (ii) a 50 \nMW parabolic trough CSP in Gansu Province, and (iii) a 92.5 MW integrated solar combined cycle (parabolic \ntrough CSP coupled with natural gas combined cycle) in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The Gansu CSP \nproject is included in the ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2013\u20132015. \nManila. ", "3 \nprojects.  These  projects  are  expected  to  contribute  to  the  knowledge  and  insight  of  the \ngovernment to formulate appropriate policy incentives for the large-scale deployment of CSP in \nthe PRC. ADB financing for the project will provide the much-needed package assistance of \nlow-cost financing, policy advice, and capacity development, which will ensure the sustainability \nof the project in the short term and lead to the wider uptake of CSP plants in the PRC in the \nmedium term.13 \n \n8.  Qinghai, which is located in the northeastern part of the Qinghai\u2013Xizang Plateau in the \nwestern part of the PRC, is particularly suited for CSP plants because of its rich solar resources \nof  2,100  kWh/m2  of  annual  DNI.  It  is  ranked  first  in  solar  power  capacity  concentration \nthroughout the PRC. Qinghai has more than 2 GW of solar photovoltaic installed capacity, which \nis more than 60% of the national capacity. The province targets installed capacity of 4 GW \n(including 300 MW of CSP) by 2015 and 10 GW (including 2 GW of CSP) by 2020, which are \nabout 20% of the national targets.  \n \n9.  The project is included in the country operations business plan, 2013\u20132015 and is \nconsistent with (i) ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, 2009; (ii) the Medium and Long-Term Development \nPlan for Renewable Energy of the PRC, 2007; and (iii) the Twelfth Five-Year Plan of the PRC.14 \nThe project will contribute to ADB\u2019s Asia Solar Energy Initiative target of adding 3,000 MW solar \npower capacity by 2013. By demonstrating a potent renewable energy technology in one of the \nmain  CSP  relevant  provinces,  the  project  will  lower  the barriers  to the  acceptance  of  the \ntechnology  and  lead  to  its  deployment,  thus  contributing  directly  to  low-carbon  energy \ndevelopment\u2014a  core  priority  in  the  country  partnership  strategy.  The  package  assistance \ncombined with direct value-added cofinancing is reflective of ADB\u2019s innovative support for this \ndemonstration project (paras. 7 and 14). \n   \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact will be the expanded share of CSP in the renewable energy mix in the PRC. \nThe outcome will be the demonstrated feasibility and reliability of the utility-scale CSP plant with \na thermal storage system in Qinghai Province.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  The project site is one of the typical locations within Qinghai Province that has 2,187 \nkWh/m2 of annual DNI. The project will utilize parabolic trough CSP,15 which is one of the four \nmajor CSP technologies with a 7-hour thermal storage system.16 The project will have two \noutputs: (i) the construction of a first-of-its-kind utility-scale CSP plant in Qinghai Province; and \n(ii)  capacity  development  and  training  in  CSP  design,  construction,  and  operation  and \n                                                 \n13 A policy recommendation on feed-in tariff and regulatory assistance to further support CSP demonstration and \ndeployment will be submitted to the government in December 2013.   \n14 ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n15 Parabolic trough CSP is the most mature and commercially proven technology used in 95% of all utility-scale CSP \nplants in the world. The parabolic trough CSP is composed of (i) a solar field system, which concentrates DNI to \ngenerate around 400\u00b0C of thermal energy; (ii) a heat transfer system; (iii) a thermal energy storage system, which \nstores excess heat from the solar field system to supply heat for power production during nights or cloudy days; \nand (iv) a power block, which generates electricity using saturated steam produced by thermal energy from the \nsolar field and thermal storage system to drive a steam turbine generator.  \n16 Thermal storage for parabolic trough CSP plants in operation or under construction that have a similar system \nconfiguration has a maximum of 7.5 hours of thermal storage system. \n ", "4 \nmanagement.17 Upon  completion,  the  project  will  generate  197  gigawatt-hours  of  clean \nelectricity fed into the existing 110 kilovolt substation in Delingha city, which results in annual \nreduction of 154,446 tons of CO .  \n2\n \nD.

Ltd. (CGN-SEDC) will provide \nmanagement support for procurement and contract management to the newly established CGN-\nDSE,  under the guidance of CGN. 21 \n \n16.  The PRC will be the borrower and will relend loan proceeds to China Exim Bank through \nthe Ministry of Finance with the same terms and conditions as the loan between it and ADB.22 \nChina Exim Bank will onlend the loan proceeds to the CGN with the same loan terms plus an \nadministration fee for onlending services. CGN will then lend the loan proceeds to CGN-DSE \nwith  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  with  China  Exim  Bank.  CGN-DSE  shall  bear  the \nexchange rate and interest rate fluctuation risks. These onlending arrangements will be done \nthrough the respective onlending agreements. \n \n17.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual.23 \n                                                 \n18 China Exim Bank is a state policy bank of the PRC under the direct leadership of the State Council. It was \nestablished in 1994 and is solely owned by the government. In 2012, it received investment-grade credit ratings \nfrom Moody\u2019s Investors Service (Aa3), Standard & Poor\u2019s (AA\u2013), and Fitch (A+). \n19 CGN is a state-owned enterprise established in 1994 under the supervision of the State-Owned Assets Supervision \nand Administration of the State Council in the PRC. Since its establishment, CGN has been developed into a large \ngroup consisting of wholly owned or controlled 32 affiliated companies in the PRC. \n20 CGN-DSE was established and legally incorporated in April 2012 and is fully owned by CGN-SEDC.  \n21 CGN-SEDC, fully owned by CGN, was established in 2009. Its core business is solar PHOTOVOLTAIC and CSP \ndevelopment. CGN-SEDC\u2019s current total installed capacity is 287 MW, which it targets to expand to 2 GW by 2015 \nand 5 GW by 2020. Its extensive previous experience in renewable energy will benefit CGN-DSE.  \n22 This onlending arrangement is essential in the PRC\u2019s internal system. China Exim Bank involvement helps meet \nthe stringent requirements of the Ministry of Finance for onlending an ADB sovereign-guaranteed loan to a large \nstate-owned enterprise such as CGN.

A comprehensive solar resource assessment was done \nbased on internationally recognized methodologies and practices for the project site in Delingha. \nThe  assessment  used  satellite-derived  solar  irradiation  and  meteorological  data  acquired \nbetween 2000 and 2012, and ground monitoring data acquired between 2011 and 2012.24 The \nassessment comprised (i) the ground data quality assessment to filter outlier data derived from \nmeasurement error, (ii) the statistical comparison and correction of the satellite database using \nfiltered ground measurement data, and (iii) the measurement of DNI which represents solar \nresource at the project site to simulate electricity yield. The estimated monthly and yearly DNI \nwere also assessed considering statistical uncertainty within 5%. This provided an estimated \nDNI of 2,187 kWh/m2 per year, which confirmed the robustness of the estimated DNI included in \nthe project feasibility.  \n \n19.   System configuration design, costs, and electricity yield. Different parabolic trough \nCSP system configurations were assessed to select the optimal design, which can also meet \nfinancial viability and plant performance criteria. The key features of the proposed system are \n(i) a 7-hour thermal energy storage system with 995 megawatt-hour thermal capacity,25 and (ii) \n621,300 square meters of solar field area to generate sufficient thermal energy to charge \nthermal energy storage while generating electricity at full capacity. The project is also designed \nwith an anti-freezing feature for the extremely cold temperatures experienced during the winter \n(para. 20) and a dry cooling system to minimize water consumption. The estimated costs were \nassessed to be adequate according to costs at a similar CSP plant in Europe.  \n                                                 \n24 Ground monitoring data at the project site covered data for 18 months from June 2011 to November 2012. \n25 The project with a 7-hour thermal energy storage system will (i) attain 44.9% of capacity factor and 3,940 annual \noperating hours, (ii) increase the net electricity yield by 45.9%, and (iii) require the solar collector loop to increase \nby 35.7%.  ", "7 \n \n20.  Freezing protection. Synthetic oil will be used as the heat transfer fluid (HTF); it will be \nheated  to  around  400\u00b0C  by  direct  solar  irradiation  and  will  generate  saturated  steam  for \nelectricity generation. The project site is located in a cold climate where mid-winter minimum \ntemperatures could fall overnight to \u201327\u00b0C, compared to the planned safe temperature of 50\u00b0C \nfor the HTF. Cold spots due to HTF freezing can cause serious damage to the piping system. \nTo avoid this, the plant will be equipped with (i) a freezing protection circulation pump, which \nforces  HTF  circulation  in  pipes  all  the  time;  (ii)  mineral  wool  insulated  pipes,  valves,  and \ninstruments in the HTF system; and (iii) a natural gas auxiliary heater to prevent the HTF from \nfalling below 50\u00b0C.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  The financial internal rate of return is calculated for the project at a tariff of CNY1.15 per \nkilowatt-hour.26 This results in a 4.82% financial internal rate of return, which is higher than the \n1.97% of the weighted average cost of capital. The sensitivity analysis shows that the financial \ninternal rate of return would decrease to (i) 4.05% if the project experiences a capital cost \noverrun of 10%, (ii) 4.57% with a 10% operating cost overrun, (iii) 3.54% if the project benefit is \nreduced by 10%, and (iv) 3.38% if the project experiences a commissioning delay of 1 year. The \nproject is considered both financially viable and sustainable. \n \n22.  The economic benefits include avoided coal usage for power generation, incremental \nelectricity sales, the improvement of grid reliability, and the associated emission reduction. The \ncalculations include all project-related costs and economic benefits. The economic internal rate \nof return for the project is 13.3%, which is more than 12.0% of the economic cost of capital. The \nsensitivity analysis shows that the economic internal rate of return could fall to (i) 12.7% if all the \neconomic benefits were reduced by 10%, (ii) 12.0% if the project experienced a cost overrun of \n10%, and (iii) 13.2% if the operation and maintenance costs rose by 10%. Thus, the project is \nconsidered economically viable.   \n \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  for  CGN  and  CGN-DSE.  The \nfinancial management and accounting procedures used by CGN and CGN-DSE are aligned with \nthe regulations and policies issued by the Ministry of Finance, and are considered effective and \nadequate for the project. CGN has developed and maintained the group company-wide financial \nmanagement monitoring and supervising structure in budgeting, asset management, funding \nmanagement, internal and external auditing, and reporting, with internal financial management \nrules and a centrally managed online financial management system. CGN-DSE also follows \nthese internal financial management rules and has incorporated them into the online financial \nmanagement system. The assessment indicates that accrual-based accounting and the PRC \nbusiness  accounting  standards  are  followed;  the  separation  of  functions  for  authorization, \ntransaction, recording, and asset management are well established; and a robust financial \nmanagement and internal auditing system are in place.  \n \n24.  Procurement  capacity  assessment  was  also  conducted.  CGN  and  CGN-DSE  have \nexperienced and trained personnel in procurement and contract management supported by \n                                                 \n26 A tariff of CNY1.15 per kilowatt-hour is assumed in the project feasibility study report approved in February 2013. \nBased on ADB\u2019s previous experience in many similar projects, the approved tariff in the feasibility report is the best \nestimate for such purpose.  \n ", "8 \nwell-established internal procedures and management systems, which is consistent with ADB \nrequirements.  The  accountability  mechanism  is  also  deemed  effective  with  the  following \nactivities performed by different groups: procurement and contract awards, disbursement, and \ninternal audit. Both CGN and CGN-DSE lack experience in procurement with international \nfinancing  institutions.  To  overcome  this  capacity  gap,  procurement  training  seminars  were \nprovided through the project preparatory TA (footnote 2), and a tendering agent with extensive \nexperience in ADB-financed infrastructure projects has been engaged to provide assistance to \nconduct procurement in line with ADB guidelines.  \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained and discussed \nwith the government, CGN, CGN-SEDC, China Exim Bank, and CGN-DSE. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual \n(footnote 23). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n26.  The project will have a positive social impact by avoiding air pollution associated with \ncoal  use  for  power  generation.  While  direct  benefits  to  low-income  households  are  not \nanticipated, the project has a positive side-benefit of employment opportunities for the local \npopulation in Delingha by generating 4,010 person-months (334 jobs) per year of unskilled labor \nduring  construction  and  360  person-months  (30  jobs)  per  year  during  operation  and \nmaintenance. Priority will be given to the affected local population (para. 29) and adjacent local \ncommunity.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  Environment (category B).  The potential adverse environmental impacts of the project \ninclude (i) soil erosion, noise, fugitive dust, solid waste, and safety risks during construction; and \n(ii) noise, solid waste and wastewater, and the leakage of synthetic oil HTF during operation. \nThe initial environmental examination (IEE) concludes that the potential adverse environmental \nimpacts can be adequately mitigated by measures outlined in the IEE, and the project will result \nin  environmental  and  socioeconomic  benefits  that  significantly  outweigh  potential  negative \nimpacts.27 The project is also designed to reduce water consumption by 73.5% compared with a \nwet cooling system to minimize impact on available water. 28 \n \n28.  CGN and CGN-DSE shall ensure the project is designed, constructed, and operated in \naccordance with the PRC\u2019s relevant national environmental laws, regulations, procedures, and \nguidelines;  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009);  and  the  project  environmental \nmanagement plan attached to the IEE. Environmental monitoring reports will be submitted to \nADB  twice  a  year  during  construction  and  annually  during  operation.  The  environmental \nmanagement plan will be updated during the engineering design and incorporated in the bidding \ndocuments and civil works contracts.  \n \n29.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category B). Land acquisition \nunder the project will affect people of the Mongolian ethnic group, and a land acquisition and \n                                                 \n27 Initial environmental examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). It has been \ndisclosed in May 2013.  \n28 0.38 million cubic meters per year of water consumption is estimated for the project with dry cooling, compared to \n1.45 million cubic meters per year with wet cooling. ", "9 \nethnic minority development plan has been prepared.29 The project will permanently acquire \n246 hectares of jointly contracted grassland with a 50-year land usage right since 1985, which \nbelongs to 153 people from 31 Mongolian ethnicity households.30 The land to be acquired is \nsemiarid unused land, which is 0.7% of the total grazing area owned by the affected households \nand will not cause loss of income and fixed assets, and physical displacement. All affected \nhouseholds are entitled to cash compensation for loss of land, and in-kind assistance such as \nemployment opportunities during the construction and operation of the project, portable solar \nphotovoltaic sets and high insulation yurts (nomad tents), and livelihood skills development \ntraining. CGN and CGN-DSE shall ensure that (i) the land acquisition and ethnic minority \ndevelopment plan is implemented, and the compensation and in-kind assistance for affected \npeople are carried out promptly and efficiently in accordance with the government\u2019s applicable \nlaws and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement; and (ii) the implementation of the land acquisition \nand ethnic minority development plan is monitored, evaluated, and reported to ADB.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  Overall,  the  associated  risks  have  been  adequately  mitigated  through  measures \nincluded in the project design and implementation arrangements.
