Maharashtra is the second largest state of India in terms of population (estimated at 112 \nmillion in 2018) and third largest in terms of land area (308,000 square kilometers [km2]). The \nmajority of the state\u2019s population (54.8%) live in rural areas and depend primarily on agriculture \nfor  employment  and  income generation.  Rural  connectivity  underpins  rural  development  in \nMaharashtra. Maharashtra has a road network of 303,000 kilometers (km), of which 67% are rural \nroads.1 Roads are the dominant mode of transportation, accounting for more than 80% of \npassenger traffic and 60% of freight traffic. Years of underinvestment have adversely affected the \ncondition of roads, especially rural roads. In rural areas, many villages still rely on earthen tracks \nthat are unsuitable for motorized traffic and often become impassable during the rainy season. \nPoor  road  infrastructure  exacerbates  poverty  and  constricts  economic  growth,  agricultural \nproductivity, and employment. The State Government of Maharashtra recognizes the importance \nof rural connectivity in improving rural livelihoods and alleviating poverty. Accordingly, it has \ninitiated two rural road construction and rehabilitation programs, namely the Prime Minister\u2019s \nRural Road Development Program (PMGSY) and the Chief Minister\u2019s Rural Road Scheme \n(MMGSY)  program.  The  Maharashtra  Rural  Road  Development  Association  (MRRDA)  is \nresponsible for implementing the PMGSY and MMGSY schemes. \n2.  The proposed project supports the MMGSY and is aligned with the following impact: \nQuality, reliable, sustainable, safe, and affordable roads that provide equitable access for all \ndeveloped (Vision 2030). The project will have the following outcome: Road transport efficiency \nand road safety in 34 districts of Maharashtra increased.2 The project outputs are: (i) conditions \nand safety of selected rural roads improved and maintained; and (ii) capacity of rural infrastructure \nagency and awareness among road users in the state enhanced. The project is estimated to cost \n$296  million. The government has requested a regular loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the project. \n  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n3.  The  proposed  transaction  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  complement  the  project  by \nstrengthening the capacity of the Maharashtra Rural Road Development Association (MRRDA) in \nmanaging rural road infrastructure. This will ensure efficient decision making on road design, \nconstruction, and operation and maintenance. The TA will support measures to ensure the \nsustainability of the assets improved under the MMGSY program.  \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n4.  Output: Capacity of rural infrastructure agency and awareness among road users in the \nState enhanced. This output will expose the MRRDA to international practices related to rural \nroad design, construction, and operation and maintenance. The output will improve the ability of \nthe  MRRDA  to  manage  rural road  networks by  strengthening its  capacity  in: (i) road  asset \nmanagement (including performance-based maintenance); (ii) road safety; (iii) climate-resilient \ndesign and construction; and (iv) web-based, real-time project monitoring.  \n                                                \n1  State Government of Maharashtra, Planning Department. 2018.

The TA is estimated to cost $1.0 million which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nADB Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 1.   \n6.  The TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n7.  ADB will administer the TA. ADB will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants and \nadminister the TA. It will be implemented over 24 months and is expected to start in September \n2019 and end in September 2021. The State of Maharashtra, acting through the MRRDA, will be \nthe executing agency.  \n8.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  September 2019\u2013September 2021 \nExecuting agency  State of Maharashtra acting through the MRRDA  \nImplementing unit  Project management unit established within MRRDA  \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nQCBS  38 person-months  $1.0 million \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting will be used for the consultant recruitment. \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time \nto time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MRRDA = Maharashtra Rural Road Development Association, QCBS = quality- and \ncost-based selection, TA = technical assistance.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n9.
