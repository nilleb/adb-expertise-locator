INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  enhance  the  capacity  of \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  (i)  meet \ninternationally agreed standards for tax transparency, (ii) counter tax evasion, and (iii) protect \nthemselves against aggressive forms of tax planning known as base erosion and profit shifting \n(BEPS).1 These three objectives are critical because a lack of transparency, tax evasion, and \nweaknesses in the international tax system (which facilitate BEPS), combine to deprive DMCs of \nessential tax revenue. The TA will support several tax-related activities benefiting specific DMCs \n(para.  14).  In  addition,  it  will  support  regional  training  to  build  the  capacity  of  DMC  tax \nadministrations (para. 19). \n \n2.  In providing this TA, ADB will build upon past TA work2 and the lessons from such work,3 \nand will complement the future activities of the Domestic Resource Mobilization Trust Fund \napproved on 25 July 2017.4 By promoting regional cooperation and assisting in building strong \nand  well-developed  tax  administrations  to  improve  tax  compliance  and  increase  revenue \ncollection, this TA is consistent with the priorities of Strategy 2020.5 \n  \n3.  This TA will (i) uphold ADB\u2019s mandate under its Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) to support efficient, accountable, and transparent public administration; and (ii) respond \nto ADB\u2019s commitment to increase its support for tax integrity initiatives in its DMCs.6 This TA is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s 2017 corporate priority TA program as a regional knowledge TA.7 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  The TA will address the following development issues: (i) lack of tax transparency, (ii) tax \nevasion, and (iii) aggressive forms of tax planning. A lack of tax transparency in some countries\u2019 \nbanking and regulatory environments permits the offshore concealment of income and assets, \nfacilitating tax evasion. Tax evasion and BEPS are global concerns since they increase the \npotential for corruption, money laundering, and financing of terrorism; distort competition; reduce \ngovernment revenue; and undermine trust in the tax system. However, the impact of tax evasion \nand BEPS in developing countries is particularly acute since they deprive governments of \nresources that could otherwise support sustainable development. \n  \n                                                \n1  BEPS occurs when multinational corporations exploit gaps and mismatches in tax rules or shift profits to locations \nwhere there is little or no real activity but the taxes are low, resulting in little or no overall corporate tax being paid. \n2  Details of such TAs are set out in ADB. 2016.

Promoting global tax transparency and countering tax evasion. Many countries have \nagreed to fight cross-border tax evasion by joining the Global Forum on Transparency and \nExchange of Information for Tax Purposes, which promotes the two international standards for \nexchange of tax information: (i) exchange of tax information on request (EOIR) and (ii) automatic \nexchange of information (AEOI). EOIR and AEOI are complementary international tax standards \nto improve the ability of tax authorities to detect tax evasion. Failing to meet these standards \n(which are assessed by the Global Forum through its peer review process) hampers global tax \ntransparency and will result in a jurisdiction receiving an unsatisfactory rating from the Global \nForum which may adversely impact its reputation.   \n \n6.   Key challenges faced by developing member countries in implementing EOIR. As \nof September 2017, 22 DMCs were not members of the Global Forum, i.e., they had not \ncommitted to EOIR or to the Global Forum\u2019s peer review process and would not derive the benefits \nof increased global tax transparency. DMCs may be deterred from joining the Global Forum by \nconcerns regarding their existing weak regulatory frameworks and a lack of resources and \ncapacity. \n \n7.  As of November 2017, two DMC members of the Global Forum had not achieved a \nsatisfactory rating for EOIR. DMCs that have achieved a satisfactory rating may face significant \nchallenges in maintaining this rating when assessed under strengthened new criteria adopted by \nthe Global Forum in 2016, including the requirement for beneficial ownership information to be \navailable for EOIR purposes in respect of legal persons and legal arrangements. \n \n8.  Key challenges faced by developing member countries in implementing AEOI. AEOI \nhas been or is being implemented by almost all Global Forum members in 2017 or 2018. As of \nOctober 2017, 30 DMCs had not committed to AEOI. Signing the Multilateral Convention on \nMutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (which provides for administrative co-operation \nbetween  states  in  the  assessment  and  collection  of  taxes)  creates  the  bilateral  exchange \nrelationships required to implement AEOI. As of November 2017, 29 DMCs had not signed the \nconvention. Many DMCs currently lack the resources and capacity to implement the information \ntechnology infrastructure (including confidentiality safeguards) required by AEOI. \n \n9.  Countering  BEPS.  The  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development \n(OECD) produced a plan to address BEPS and has invited countries to join the Inclusive \nFramework on BEPS, which develops standards on BEPS related issues and will monitor and \nsupport the implementation of BEPS measures. As of November 2017, over 107 countries had \nbecome members of the Inclusive Framework on BEPS and committed to the BEPS Action Plan.8 \n \n10.  Key challenges faced by developing member countries in countering BEPS. As of \nNovember 2017, 29 DMCs had not joined the Inclusive Framework on BEPS. DMCs that have \njoined need to ensure that the priorities of developing countries for tackling BEPS are addressed \nwhen standards are developed for BEPS related issues. Many DMCs will require significant \nchanges to their inadequate and inconsistent tax laws in order to implement BEPS measures. \n \n11.  In June 2017, over 70 jurisdictions signed the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax \nTreaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (MLI).9  As of October 2017, \n                                                \n8  The BEPS Action Plan comprises actions to equip governments to address tax avoidance, and requires countries \ncommit to certain minimum standards in specified areas, such as treaty abuse and harmful tax practices. \n9  OECD. Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit \nShifting. http://www.oecd.org/tax/treaties/multilateral-instrument-BEPS-tax-treaty-information-brochure.pdf \n ", "3 \n \n35 DMCs had not signed the MLI. DMCs that have signed the MLI will be unable to benefit from \nkey measures to tackle BEPS (i.e. automatic exchange of country-by-country reports and tax \nrulings)  unless  they  have  in  place  the  information  technology  infrastructure  (including \nconfidentiality safeguards) required by AEOI. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: capacity of developing countries to strengthen \ntax systems, reduce illicit financial flows, and combat tax evasion (a predicate offense for money \nlaundering) and corruption increased.10 \n \n13.  The TA will have the following outcome: global tax transparency increased and legal and \ninstitutional tax systems of DMCs to protect themselves against tax evasion and aggressive forms \nof tax planning strengthened. \n \n14.  The TA will, as required, assist DMCs identified as described in para. 22 to: \n \n(i)  join the Global Forum and implement EOIR (for DMCs that are not yet members); \n(ii)  prepare for, and successfully complete, the Global Forum\u2019s peer review process \nfor EOIR by addressing identified gaps in DMCs\u2019 legal, tax and administrative \ninfrastructure;    \n(iii)  commit to implement AEOI, become a signatory of the Multilateral Convention on \nMutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, and put in place the information \ntechnology infrastructure (including confidentiality safeguards) required to benefit \nfrom AEOI and key BEPS measures; \n(iv)  prepare for, and successfully complete, the Global Forum\u2019s peer review process \nfor AEOI (when implemented);  \n(v)  participate in the Inclusive Framework on BEPS, including becoming a signatory \nof the MLI; and prepare for, and successfully complete, the peer review process \nfor the Inclusive Framework on BEPS (when implemented). 11 \n \n15.  The TA will also be used for regional high-level policy dialogue (para. 18) and in-country \nand regional conferences, seminars, and training, in conjunction with the Global Forum or other \nstakeholders (para. 19). \n \n \n                                                \n10 The Post-2015 Development Agenda is an ambitious global vision that seeks to tackle extreme poverty, curb climate \nchange, and put the world on a more prosperous and sustainable path by 2030. It includes the following four key \ncomponents: (i) The Declaration - a vision statement of what we want to achieve in the next development agenda; \n(ii) Goals and Targets \u2013 a new set of goals and targets to build on and succeed the MDGs; (iii) Financing and the \nMeans of Implementation \u2013 the \u201chow\u201d of delivering the Post-2015 Development Agenda; and (iv) Monitoring and \nReview  \u2013  defining  a  process  to  track  progress  on  commitments  made  by  all  stakeholders. \nhttp://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/working-with-the-un/post-2015-development-\nagenda/?referrer=https://www.google.com.ph/   \n11 During initial consultations with regional departments and countries, ADB identified Cambodia, Papua New Guinea, \nand Thailand as strong candidates for support under this TA. ADB expects countries that are scheduled to have a \npeer review for EOIR in the near future to seek assistance. Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of \nInformation  for  Tax  Purposes.  2016\u20132020  Schedule  of  Reviews  (September  2017). \nhttp://www.oecd.org/tax/transparency/about-the-global-forum/publications/schedule-of-reviews.pdf. ADB will raise \nawareness of this TA through close coordination with other stakeholders (para. 21). \n ", "4   \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n \n16.  Output  1:  In-country  consultation  and  country  capacity  needs  assessment \nconducted. At the start of TA implementation and continuing until June 2020 (as participating \nDMCs are identified), ADB will carry out in-country consultations, and help each participating DMC \nprepare a country-specific action plan which (i) identifies its capacity development needs; (ii) \nproposes concrete improvement measures; and (iii) sets out a detailed plan (including milestones \nand  cost  estimates  where  feasible)  for  the  successful  implementation  of  the  identified \nimprovement measures. The detailed action plan will include (a) key actions required to be \nundertaken and resources provided, by the participating DMC and (b) operational support to the \nparticipating DMC to be provided by the TA project team. \n \n17.  Output 2: Operational support to address issues or deficiencies identified in the \ncountry capacity needs assessment for each participating developing member country \nprovided. Until approximately 6 months before end of the TA implementation period, ADB will \nprovide substantive operational support for each participating DMC based on the action plan \ndeveloped under output 1. The operational support may vary considerably, according to the \nidentified issues or deficiencies. ADB will require its consultants to prepare progress reports for \nongoing activities for each participating DMC based on its action plan.12 \n \n18.  Output 3: Regional high-level policy dialogue to raise awareness conducted and \ncommitment to implement identified measures obtained. The TA will support dialogues to \nraise awareness and obtain a commitment from each participating DMC to implement its action \nplan. ADB will engage with regional associations of tax administration bodies to promote further \nregional cooperation. \n \n19.  Output  4:  Skills  development  through  training  workshops,  conferences,  and \nseminars conducted in-country and regionally; and relevant manuals, handbooks and/or \ne-learning modules produced. ADB will conduct training workshops, conferences, and seminars \non international tax transparency and cooperation in conjunction with the Global Forum, regional \ntax administration associations and other stakeholders, with the aim of enhancing the capacity of \neach participating DMC to implement its action plan, and to ensure further regional cooperation. \nThe TA will support the publication of relevant manuals, handbooks and, as appropriate, e-\nlearning modules. The materials will be made available digitally, and will be printed on demand. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s Office of Anticorruption and Integrity will administer and coordinate the TA adopting \na \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach. It will be supported by the public management specialist (taxation) from \nthe  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change  Department,  and  will  work  in  close \n                                                \n12 In the event that a DMC\u2019s capacity development action plan includes financing requirements, the TA will assist the \nDMC to identify sources of financing. \n ", "5 \n \ncooperation with the regional departments, the Global Forum, other stakeholders13 and the \nparticipating DMCs.14 \n \n22.   The TA (which is available to assist all DMCs) will implement specific activities with the \nparticipating DMCs, i.e. DMCs that (i) have requested assistance in the areas identified in para. \n14 above; (ii) are committed to achieving the objectives of this TA; and (iii) are selected by ADB \nfollowing discussions with the DMCs and relevant stakeholders (para. 21).  ADB is conducting \nongoing informal consultations with several DMCs. \n \n23.  The  nature  of  the  support  to  be  provided  under  this  TA  requires  ADB  to  engage \ninternational consultants who are well versed in tax transparency, Global Forum peer reviews and \nBEPS related issues. Such expertise resides with a limited number of individuals, who will work \nwith national tax experts. ADB\u2019s objective will be the timely and efficient conduct of the TA, to \nmaximize value for its DMCs and to help achieve this, it will engage an international taxation \nspecialist to manage the TA.15   \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  January 2018\u2013January 2021.

See footnote 10. \nb  Not all the performance indicators may be achieved since (depending on the support provided to the participating DMCs) \nsome performance indicators may not be relevant.  \nc  Numeric targets are not included since the objective of the TA is to respond to the varying needs of participating DMCs. This \nmeans that it must be flexible in its approach, and not tied to any specific allocation in order achieve numeric targets. The \nlack of numeric targets will not impede ADB\u2019s ability to measure the results of the TA since the benchmarks for the relevant \nperformance parameters are known.   \nc  Start and completion dates have been added where feasible. However, since the TA will comprise a rolling program of \nassistance, the start and end date of certain activities will vary, for each participating DMC, and will largely be driven by \nfactors such as the urgency of the DMC\u2019s needs and the nature of the assistance provided. For this reason, it is also not \npossible to ascertain, in advance, dates for interim milestones.  \nSource: ADB\n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \n   \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000)  \n \n \nItem  Amount \nAsian Development Banka   \n1.
