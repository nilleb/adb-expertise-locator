The Government of Bangladesh requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) 2006 \nCountry Program Confirmation Mission to provide assistance for skills development. A project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA) fact-finding mission visited Bangladesh from 26 to 31 \nJanuary  2006  to  review  the  rationale,  scope,  implementation  schedule  and  arrangements, \nfinancing plan, framework, and terms of reference for the TA. The mission met senior officials of \nthe Ministry of Education (MOE); Directorate of Technical Education; Bangladesh Technical \nEducation  Board;  Bureau  of  Manpower,  Employment  and  Training;  Economic  Relations \nDivision;  Planning  Commission;  and  development  partners.  The  draft  memorandum  of \nunderstanding was discussed during a wrap-up meeting on 2 February 2006, chaired by the \nsecretary of MOE. The memorandum of understanding presents the TA design and monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1) and reflects the discussions and understandings reached between the \nGovernment and ADB regarding its scope and arrangements.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Government\u2019s National Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) paper prioritizes technical \nand  vocational  education  and  training  (TVET)  and  making  education  more  job-oriented  to \naccelerate poverty reduction. The PRS paper recognizes that the lack of skilled workers limits \nthe growth of some sectors of the economy and that the lack of appropriate skills and education \nprevents the unskilled and the poor from earning.2 Among government goals is to \u201csubstantially \nincrease the proportion of post-primary students enrolling in TVET.\u201d TVET aims to increase the \nnumber of graduates working locally and abroad; increase the number of students passing \nterminal certificate examinations; and expand opportunities for the poor, youth, and women. \n \n3.  The TVET subsector offers both long- and short-term skills training. Government and \nnongovernment  training  providers,  including  madrasahs,  offer  long-term  TVET.  Over  160 \ngovernment schools and training institutions under MOE and the Ministry of Expatriate Welfare \nand  Overseas  Employment,  as  well  as  over  1,100  nongovernment  training  providers  offer \ncertificate and diploma3 training programs. The vocational stream is available from grade 9. At \nleast 40 trades, including dressmaking, fish culture and breeding, electrical maintenance, civil \nconstruction,  and  automotive  repair  and  maintenance,  are  offered.  Students  may  take  the \nsecondary  school  certificate  (vocational\u2014SSC[Voc])  examination  after  completing  the \nvocational stream curriculum in grade 10. Successful students can continue with the vocational \nstream at grades 11 and 12, leading to the higher secondary certificate (vocational\u2014HSC[Voc]). \nStudents can enroll in degree programs after passing the HSC(Voc) examination. Alternatively, \nSSC(Voc) certificate holders may enroll in polytechnic institutions, in programs leading to a \ntechnical education diploma. In 2002, over 140,000 students were enrolled in certificate and \ndiploma TVET programs.  \n \n4.  The ministries of youth and sports, and women\u2019s and children\u2019s affairs, as well as \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  offer  short-term  training.  These  are  mainly  for  self-\nemployment,  and  some  are  combined  with  microcredit  programs.  Some  training  providers \nconducting long-term training also offer short-term training. For-profit private trade schools offer \nshort-term training programs, primarily in connection with foreign labor demand.  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 20 February 2006. \n2  Government of People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh. 2005. Unlocking the Potential: National Strategy for Accelerated \nPoverty Reduction. Dhaka. This paragraph summarizes key points relating to technical education and vocational \ntraining. \n3  Vocational training is at the certificate-level while technical training is at the diploma-level.  \n ", "2   \n \n5.  The TVET system needs to make its training programs more relevant. Although skilled \nlabor  is  lacking  in  various  sectors,  many  training  graduates  are  still  unemployed  or \nunderemployed. The placement rates of public training providers are estimated to be from 40% \nand 65%.4 Training programs should address local and foreign labor market needs5 and should \nlead to jobs or income-generating activities for its graduates. Systems that are responsive to \nlabor market needs and opportunities have to be created  to ensure that relevant occupational \nareas are identified, and related skills and training standards, as well as training programs, are \ndeveloped and updated. The private sector and commerce and industry employers should be \nmore actively involved in, and labor market information should help guide the development or \nupdate of, training programs. Current skills and training standards and their related curricula \nneed to be reviewed vis-\u00e0-vis market demands, and updated as necessary. Some training \nprograms will need to be revised to keep up with the latest technologies.  \n \n6.  The quality of formal training programs needs to improve. Pass rates for the SSC(Voc) \nexamination averaged 45% from 2003 and 2004. In 2002, only 19% of HSC(Voc) examinees \npassed. TVET teachers and trainers need to upgrade their skills and knowledge, as many are \nuntrained and lack practical experience. The demand for trained trainers and teachers cannot \nbe filled by the present system\u2014only one vocational teachers\u2019 training institution and one \ntechnical teachers\u2019 training institution produce a combined total of about 300 graduates annually. \nIn  addition,  training  equipment  should  be  upgraded  to  meet  market  needs  and  training \nstandards.   \n \n7.  Access to skills training under the present TVET system is limited and geared primarily \ntoward male students who have completed grade 8. Each year, more than 600,000 children \nleave primary education and over 600,000 secondary education students leave school before \ngrade 9. Many of those who leave school come from poor households and lack skills necessary \nfor jobs or income-generating activities (Appendix 2). Semiskilled and skilled workers who need \nnot have completed secondary education are in demand, but few training programs meet this \nneed. Lessons can be learned from the experiences of public training institutions, NGOs, and \nprivate training providers offering short-term training that is responsive to market needs and \ndoes not require completion of grade 8. Training programs can be flexible in duration, schedule, \nand age and education requirements. Although almost half of those who leave school are \nfemales, they comprise only about a quarter of TVET students. More females need to be \nattracted to TVET, including nontraditional trades for females, to improve their job opportunities \nand income.  \n \n8.  The Government provides assistance to over 600 nongovernment training providers, as \nwell as stipends to some trainees. The Government provides assistance to TVET to aid the \ncountry\u2019s  economic  development  and  give  equal  access  to  training  to  a  broad  range  of \nstakeholders. Improving the relevance and quality of, and access to, TVET will require more \nresources. Unit costs in TVET are generally higher than in general education. More funds are \nneeded to (i) operate, maintain, and optimally use training equipment; (ii) provide adequate \nconsumable training supplies and materials; and (iii) provide in-service training to trainers and \nteachers. A strategy should be developed to ensure that training programs receive adequate \nresources, run efficiently, and are conducted in a sustainable manner. Lessons can be learned \nfrom successful activities of private institutions and NGOs. The administration and management \n                                                 \n4  There is dearth of information on placement rates of nongovernment training providers. \n5  Foreign employment is a major source of remittances for Bangladesh. \n ", "  3\nof  government  training  institutions  need  to  be  reviewed  and  strengthened  for  better \nmanagement, improved entrepreneurial skills, and greater flexibility.  \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s country strategy for Bangladesh supports the PRS and continues assistance for \nsocial development. ADB provides assistance to primary and secondary education.6 Its key \npriority in developing the country\u2019s skills base includes improving the quality and relevance of \nTVET.  One  of  the  lessons  identified  from  ADB  assistance  in  education  and  training  in \nBangladesh and other countries is that training programs must be linked to labor market needs. \nADB will help the TVET system achieve greater flexibility and be responsive to labor market \nneeds and requirements of the informal sector. ADB will coordinate with development partners \nthat are interested in engaging in the TVET subsector, particularly the World Bank and the \nEuropean Union. The World Bank is interested in assisting TVET and has initiated a sector \nstudy.  The  European  Union  is  interested  in  providing  capacity-strengthening  technical \nassistance and piloting some training activities.  \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The objective of the project preparatory TA is to help the Government prepare a project \nproposal for possible project loan financing to improve the relevance, quality, access, efficiency, \nand financing of TVET. This will contribute to improving the country\u2019s skills base, provide more \npeople with income-generating opportunities, and help reduce poverty. The TA will have the \nfollowing outputs: (i) situation analysis; (ii) recommendations for necessary TVET policy reforms \nand development activities; and (iii) project loan design proposal, which includes support for the \ndevelopment  of  short-term  training  programs  and  basic  skills  development,  capacity \nstrengthening, and project implementation.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n11.  The TA will conduct a situation analysis of the TVET subsector. The analysis will build \non TVET assessments and studies undertaken by the World Bank, other development partners, \nresearch organizations, and NGOs. The TA will examine TVET-related policies, including (i) \ninterministerial  coordination  and  scope  and  distribution  of  responsibilities,  (ii)  labor  market \nregulations,  (iii)  training  incentives  for  employers,  (iv)  training  and  labor  policies,  and  (v) \nregulatory framework of nongovernment training providers, including those operating for profit. \nAfter the analysis is completed, the TA will recommend potential TVET policy reform and \ndevelopment activities to improve relevance, quality, access, efficiency, and financing. The TA \nwill then develop a project design aimed at the same subsector objectives, to be proposed for \npossible project loan financing by ADB. The project design proposal may include (i) developing \nlinkages and partnerships with the private sector and employers; (ii) strengthening the capacity \nof  TVET  administration  and  training  and  teaching  personnel;  (iii) development  of  TVET \nadministration systems; (iv) development of skills and training standards and training curricula, \nincluding for short-term training and madrasahs; (v) development of qualifications framework \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2003.

The  proposal  will  include  a  project \nimplementation plan and recommended policy adjustments to sustain project effectiveness. The \nproposal will take into consideration assistance to be given by the EU, the World Bank, and \nother development partners.  \n \n12.  The TA will conduct a labor market study to identify occupational areas where the supply \nof trained workers does not meet the demand. The study will help identify training programs\u2014\nincluding programs offering more training to women and to those who leave school before grade \n9\u2014that will be strengthened or developed by the project. The TA will also (i) examine the \nmarket relevance and opportunities for women and early school leavers of the TVET curricula \nand training programs currently delivered by government schools and institutions, including \nmadrasahs;  (ii)  conduct  a  study  of  the  capacity  strengthening  needs  of  selected  training \ninstitutions that could be supported through the proposed project; (iii) make recommendations \non necessary institutional strengthening inputs; and (iv) review the different mechanisms for \ndelivering TVET, including modular courses and make recommendations for alternative training \nprogram delivery.  \n \n13.  The TA will conduct stakeholder workshops and focus group discussions to (i) support \nthe  situation  analysis,  (ii)  solicit  inputs  and  feedback  on  TVET  reform  and  investment \nrecommendations, and (iii) refine the project design proposal. Stakeholders will include school-\nleavers,  representatives  of  relevant  government  agencies,  and  representatives  of  private \ntraining providers and NGOs. TA implementation will ensure that employer representatives are \nactively involved in consultations and discussions. The TA will coordinate with development \npartners that are engaged or planning to engage in the TVET subsector. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $625,000. ADB will finance the \nequivalent of $500,000. The remaining $125,000 will be contributed by the Government and will \ninclude  office  accommodation,  utilities,  transport,  remuneration  of  counterpart  staff,  and \nadministration support. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government has been informed that approval \nof the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MOE will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A project steering committee (PSC) will be \nestablished to provide overall guidance to the TA team. The PSC, chaired by the secretary of \nMOE, will comprise (i) representatives from the ministries of Expatriate Welfare and Overseas \nEmployment,  Labour  and  Employment,  Youth  and  Sports,  Women  and  Children\u2019s  Affairs, \nIndustries,  and  Commerce;  (ii)  representatives  of  the  Economic  Relations  Division;  \nthe  Planning  Commission;  Department  of  Technical  Education;  Bureau  of  Manpower, \nEmployment  and  Training;  Bangladesh  Technical  Education  Board;  and  the  Bangladesh \nMadrasah Education Board; (iii) at least three members representing industry, employers, and \nprivate training providers; and (iv) an NGO representative. At least two members will be women. \nThe PSC will be established before the start of the TA. It will meet at least once in the early \nphase of implementation to discuss the situation analysis, and at least twice in the later phase to \n ", "  5\nprovide guidance on policy reforms and proposed investment activities. The PSC will (i) monitor \nthe progress of the TA; (ii) provide policy and project guidance; (iii) establish ownership by the \nGovernment; (iv) ensure and facilitate coordination across different stakeholders; (v) ensure that \nthe design maximizes the development impact for the poor; and (vi) support the ensuing loan \nprocessing, if any.  \n \n16.  The  Government  will  appoint  a  focal  person  to  work  directly  with  the  TA  team.  \nThe focal person will also attend PSC meetings. MOE and the Ministry of Expatriate Welfare \nand Overseas Employment will designate counterpart staff to work on a part-time basis with the \nconsultants. MOE will provide administrative support and adequate office space. The office will \nhave utilities, furniture, local telephone services, and internet access. The consulting firm will \nprocure  equipment,  software,  and  furniture,  as  necessary,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines.  The  equipment,  software,  and  furniture  will  be  transferred  to  the \nGovernment on completion of the TA.  \n \n17.  The TA will employ the services of three international (12.5 person-months) and five \ndomestic (18.5 person-months) consultants for a total of 31 person-months. The international \nconsultants will be specialists in (i) TVET policy, management, and institutional development; \n(ii) TVET programs; and (iii) TVET finance and economics.
