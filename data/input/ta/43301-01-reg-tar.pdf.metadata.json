INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  countries1 strongly  believe  that  adopting  a \nregional approach to energy sector management would promote affordable, sustainable, and \nsecure energy supplies. Given each country\u2019s individual energy needs and varying resource \nendowment, the regional approach allows for identification of the most cost-efficient projects \nand  diversification  of  sources  to  enhance  energy  supply  security  within  the  GMS  in  an \nenvironment-friendly  manner.  The  governments  of  GMS  countries  requested  technical \nassistance (TA)2 from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to promote low carbon technologies \nincluding renewable energy (such as biomass, solar, wind, and micro and/or mini-hydro); clean \nfuels (such as biofuels and natural gas); and energy efficiency measures. The design and \nmonitoring framework for the regional TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n2.  The  GMS  has  made  significant  progress  in  power  sector  integration  through  the \nRegional Power Trade and Coordination Committee (RPTCC). Similar opportunities exist in the \nareas of renewable energy, clean fuels, and energy efficiency that can help secure additional \nsources  of  energy  while  meeting  national  targets  in  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  reductions. \nFacilitation of investment and transfer of low carbon technologies will be critical in meeting the \nsubregion\u2019s development objectives. In the last decade, some of the GMS countries more than \nothers have made significant progress in the areas of renewable energy, clean fuels, and \nenergy efficiency. Therefore, considerable knowledge and lessons can be shared among the \ncountries. Further, given the different stages of economic development of the GMS countries; \nthere are significant opportunities for indigenization of the technologies within the countries and \nto lower costs.  \n \n3.        Notwithstanding these opportunities, regional cooperation on clean energy has lagged \nbehind, owing to the lack of a shared vision on clean energy cooperation, and a regional \nplatform that could stimulate enhanced cooperation. To address this shortcoming, the GMS \nRoad Map for Expanded Cooperation in the Energy Sector was adopted in June 2009 by the \n15th  GMS  Ministerial  Conference.  According  to  this  road  map,  maintaining  energy  supply \nsecurity,  accessibility,  affordability,  and  environmental  sustainability  are  important  energy \nobjectives of the GMS countries, given widespread energy poverty in the subregion. The GMS \nSustainable Energy Forum (SEF) was identified as the implementing network for facilitating \nimproved regional cooperation. The SEF however, is in its infancy, and dedicated support is \nneeded for it to evolve into a vibrant GMS-wide platform for sharing knowledge and experience.  \n \n4.  The current regional TA supported by ADB is designed to provide direct and key support \nfor implementation of the GMS Road Map for Expanded Cooperation in the Energy Sector and \nstrongly supports the GMS countries\u2019 climate change mitigation efforts by facilitating investment \nand transfer of more sustainable and environment-friendly energy supply options.  The TA \nsupports sustainable economic growth, which is the core strategic area of ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2020.3 The project complements all the Strategy 2020 cross-cutting themes of promoting the \nrole of the private sector in development, supporting regional cooperation and integration for \ndevelopment, and addressing environmental sustainability. The TA is consistent with the GMS \n                                                \n1  Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 July 2010. \n3  ADB. 2008.

The framework for which is being currently developed, , \ntaking into account emerging global and regional trends and challenges, will  inform a new \nstrategic vision for GMS economic cooperation and provide the necessary goals and action \nplans for the GMS program, 2012\u20132022. During implementation, the TA will take into account \nthe results of a preliminary study assessing the strategies and options on rural renewable \nenergy development completed recently by the GMS Working Group on Agriculture, and will \nprovide inputs to the various rural and renewable energy development investment projects that \nare being developed by the ADB within GMS countries, and are included in the countries\u2019 \noperations business plan pipelines.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The impact of the TA will be to enhance the supply of energy in the GMS in a resource-\nefficient  and  environment-friendly  manner for economic growth  and poverty  reduction. The \noutcome of the TA will be the effective transfer of low carbon practices and technologies within \nthe GMS. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The TA will be implemented under the auspices of the SEF and will aim to realize the \nobjectives of the GMS Road Map for Expanded Cooperation in the Energy Sector. The SEF will \nalso be the vehicle for dissemination of knowledge and experiences that are accumulated \nthrough the activities of the TA. In addition to the periodic meetings of the SEF, the TA will also \nconduct specific training workshops and consultations on selected renewable energy, clean fuel, \nand energy efficiency technologies, practices, and business models.  \n \n7.  Specifically, the TA will produce the following outputs: \n \n(i)  the SEF strengthened as the forum for information exchange and knowledge sharing \non  renewable  energy,  clean  fuels,  and  energy  efficiency;  and  as  the  forum  for \nnetworking and technical exchanges between planners/policy makers and the private \nsector;  \n \n(ii)  a regional database of best practices and technologies on renewable energy, clean \nfuels, and energy efficiency developed, to be linked with existing databases such as \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the RPTCC; \n \n(iii)  subregional performance targets developed for use of renewable energy and clean \nfuels, and energy efficiency savings; \n(iv)  renewable energy and clean fuels resources, and energy efficiency potential map \nproduced  for  all  GMS  countries,  with  a  technology-  and-cost-based  ranking  of \nvarious options; and \n(v)  business models identified for deployment of selected energy efficiency, renewable \nenergy, and clean fuels technologies based on the local conditions of each GMS \n                                                \n4 ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n ", "  3  \ncountry; and at least five pilot project proposals identified for financing by ADB and \nother financing agencies.   \n \n8.  The business models to be developed under the TA will include the following features: \n(i) suitable technology adapted to local conditions; (ii) specific policy package in support of the \nselected  technology;  (iii)  significant  local  content  in  manufacturing  of  the  equipment; \n(iv) definition of the role of public and private investors; and (v) competitive cost (investment, \noperation,  and  maintenance).  Pilot  projects  will  be  designed  using  the  business  models \ndeveloped under the TA. Since GMS countries are in different stages of development, the \nbusiness models will have to be tailored for each GMS country for the selected renewable, \nclean fuel, and energy efficiency technology; and the technology will have to be transferred from \none GMS country to another with knowledge transfer and capacity development. In this regard, \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Thailand will not be hosting pilot projects, but they \ncan provide the knowledge to other GMS countries where the pilot projects will be implemented.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The total cost of the TA will be $1,000,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Asian Clean Energy Fund5 (for GMS countries other than the PRC) and $200,000 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund6 (for the PRC), both \nunder the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, and administered by ADB. The detailed \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA  and  will  provide  administration  and \ntechnical  support  services  through  the  Environmental  Operations  Center  (EOC)7 based  in \nBangkok, Thailand. Within ADB, the project will be managed by the Southeast Asia Energy and \nWater Division.  \n \nThe focal points for each participating country will be the ministries or agencies responsible for \npreparation of the power sector development plan. The focal points will be defined by the \nrespective countries and individual representatives established prior to commencement of the \nTA. The focal points for the TA will participate in the meetings of the SEF and relevant sessions \nof the RPTCC. \n \n11.  The TA will require the services of a consulting firm for 48 person-months (including \n20 person-months  international  and  28  person-months  national  consultants).  The  terms  of \nreference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  ADB  will  select  and  engage  consultants  in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n                                                \n5  Established by the Government of Japan. \n6  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. \n7 EOC is the implementation facility for ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for the Core Environment Program and \nBiodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative in the Greater Mekong Subregion. Manila (TA 6289-REG). Owing to \nits ongoing engagement with various GMS counterparts on environment and energy related activities (e.g., support \nfor strategic environment assessment of Viet Nam\u2019s Seventh Power Development Plan) and its physical proximity \nto the GMS, EOC is ideally placed to support the implementation of this regional TA. ADB will require its capacity \ndevelopment TA consultants to work with the EOC, including working out of its offices in Bangkok, Thailand, when \nthey are on mission in the GMS, and ensure that all resource assessment reports, GIS maps, knowledge \nportal/website, etc. are based at the EOC. The regional TA\u2019s budget will provide a total of $30,000 to support \ncomputing hardware and other related expenses. The EOC on its part will provide (out of its own budget) a half-\ntime TA technical coordinator, based at EOC, which would support the ADB project officer.  \n ", "4   \nThe simplified technical proposal procedure will be used for selecting the consulting firm based \non the quality- and cost-based selection process at a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. Disbursements \nunder  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will commence in February 2011 and \nbe implemented over a period of 24 months. The consultant will prepare inception, interim, draft \nfinal  and  final  reports.  In  addition,  the  consultant  will  also  develop  technical  reports  and \nassessments as identified in the work plan and conduct training sessions and the annual GMS \nSEF meetings. The EOC will assist in the identification and selection of the national consultants. \nAll procurement will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as \namended from time to time). The TA outputs will be disseminated by a variety of means, \nincluding website publication, in-country workshops, electronic reports, and other means to be \nspecified in a knowledge dissemination action plan, to be prepared as part of the inception \nreport.  \n \nIV.
