THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) seeks to establish a regional facility to provide grants \nto participating Pacific developing member countries (DMCs)1 that will finance affordable clean \nenergy financial intermediation loans for poor, low-income, and women borrowers. The proposed \ngrant facility (the Facility) of $15 million will finance clean energy projects in the participating \nPacific DMCs to be implemented by the Pacific state-owned development banks (PSDBs). The \nproject is consistent with the objectives of ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2016\u22122020 of expanding \nADB\u2019s operations in climate change and disaster risk management; and mobilizing more financing \nfor the Pacific region and promoting innovative solutions to strengthen disaster preparedness, \naddress vulnerability, and build resilience.2  The impact of the project will be improved regional \nenergy security in the Pacific region consistent with the draft Framework for Action on Energy \nSecurity in the Pacific (2020\u22122030).3 The outcome will be increased generation of lower cost, \nreliable, and clean energy. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will help prepare the Facility and an associated \nTA  to  implement  the  Facility.  In  addition  to  the  remoteness  of  most  Pacific  DMCs  and \ndiseconomies of scale in their energy sectors, clean renewable energy and energy efficiency \nremain under-exploited mainly due to higher upfront capital costs and institutional inertia that limits \ncompetition and private capital mobilization. The Pacific DMCs have limited borrowing and debt-\nservice capacity, and have relied heavily on grant funding for capital intensive energy projects. \nThe energy sector in the Pacific DMCs remains heavily controlled by state-owned utilities with \ninherent operational inefficiencies, chronic liquidity deficits, and limited capital resources for \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency projects. Electricity supply remains dominated by diesel-\nbased  generation  despite  the  potential  for  cost-competitive  renewable  energy  and  energy \nefficiency deployment. Grant funding has not been fully employed to leverage private sector \nparticipation in renewable energy development.4 In order to meet energy security objectives as \nwell as the Paris Agreement and Nationally Determined Commitments, a different approach and \nfinancing  modality  are  required,  wherein  governments  help  to  leverage  grant  financing  by \nreducing perceived market risks and barriers in order to mainstream investments for clean energy, \nincluding retail lending for distributed solar and energy efficiency deployment. \n \n3.  The Facility will be the first of its kind to mainstream retail clean energy financing in the \nPacific. While the ADB funding will be provided on a grant basis to participating Pacific DMCs for \neach  project  under  the  Facility  \u2013  wherein  the  DMC  will  re-lend  the  grant  to  its  PSDB  at \nconcessional (zero) interest rate and the PSDB will then onlend to beneficiaries in the form of \nfinancial intermediation  loans with a margin for the cost of administration and credit risk premium.5 \n \n1  The proposed financing facility will target Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Samoa, \nSolomon Islands, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.  \n2   ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. Manila. The Pacific Approach is ADB\u2019s overall country partnership \nstrategy for the 11 small Pacific island countries. The project concept was discussed and agreed with the participating \nPacific DMCs and proposed for ADB\u2019s Pacific regional operations business plan, 2021\u20132023.  \n3  The draft Framework for Energy Security and Resilience in the Pacific, 2021\u2013-2030. \n4  ADB. 2019. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Pacific Renewable Energy \nProgram. Manila. \n5  This follows requirements set out in para. 18 of Operations Manual D6/BP on Financial Intermediation Loans (that \nfinancial intermediaries\u2019 onlending rates for sub-borrowers should be market-based and where there is no market-\n \n ", "2 \nThe interest charged to sub-loans funded through the Facility will not include PSDBs\u2019 profit margin \nand will be used by the borrowers to purchase clean energy products (as sub-projects). A \nminimum of 50% of all sub-loans in a DMC will be used to finance poor and low-income \nhouseholds. Furthermore, at least 20% of all sub-loans will be to women borrowers. A ceiling for \na single sub-loan amount per borrower will be determined at due diligence stage for each eligible \nproject under the Facility. The maturity of these sub-loans will be set at a level that ensures the \ncustomer\u2019s savings on energy will exceed the loan payments to the PSDB, thus providing a net \neconomic benefit to the end customer. All sub-loan repayments received by a PSDB will be \nreturned to an escrow account established by the Ministry of Finance (or equivalent) and will be \nre-lent to the PSDB, provided that the bank remains financially sound. \n \n4.  As a multi-country facility, sharing of pricing and risk assessment strategies and protocols \nacross countries will decrease the transaction costs for the national banks. This will enable \ncheaper loans for customers purchasing renewable energy equipment and a greater use of \nrenewable energy within the region, beyond what would be possible through disconnected \nnational interventions. \n \n5.  The first two projects under the investment facility will include clean energy financing \nprojects in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and Kiribati. The facility and projects are \nexpected to be categorized as at least \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming.\u201d   \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.

It is also \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s policy on relending of Asian Development Fund assistance for beneficiaries, which are \ncommercially operated public corporations (such as PSDBs), that relending is generally to be on terms harder than \nthose of the Asian Development Fund financing (ADB. 1980.

Cost and Financing \n \n7.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which (i) $200,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7), (ii) $400,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Clean Energy Fund6 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \n(CEFPF) and administered by ADB, and (iii) $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Fund.7 The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1.  \n \n8.  Resources from the CEFPF will be used to finance operational expenses in the form of \nforeign exchange and/or local expenditures and services from ADB member countries following \nADB\u2019s guidelines and procedures. 8 \n \n9.  The beneficiary governments will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart \nstaff, office and communications facilities for consultants, office supplies, domestic transportation, \nand other in-kind contributions. The governments have been informed that approval of the TA \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  ADB will administer the TA. The Energy Division of ADB\u2019s Pacific Department will select, \nsupervise, and evaluate consultants. The consultants will work closely with counterpart agencies \nin  FSM  and  Kiribati.  A  Facility  Support  Unit  will  be  established  in  ADB  to  support  the \nimplementation of the Facility. Project implementation units (PIUs) will also be set up within the \nimplementing  agencies  in  each  participating  Pacific  DMCs.  The  Facility  Support  Unit  will \n(i) provide oversight over the consulting firm(s); (ii) support the national PIUs, including sharing of \nlessons  learned  between  PIUs;  (iii)  monitor  and  report  on  processing  and  implementation \nprogress; and (iv) support participating PSDBs\u2019 capacity building and training. \n11.
