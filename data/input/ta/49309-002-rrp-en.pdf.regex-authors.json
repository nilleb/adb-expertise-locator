THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Hubei Yichang Comprehensive Elderly Care \nDemonstration Project. \n \n2.  The proposed project aims to support the development of a three-tiered elderly care \nsystem (ECS) in Yichang Municipality, Hubei Province by improving the coverage and utilization \nof home-based, community-based, and residential-based elderly care services. \n \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The PRC has the largest elderly population in the world. Rapid urbanization, internal \n \nmigration of youth from rural areas, and the previous one-child policy have affected traditional \nfamily support systems, which are currently unable to meet elderly care needs.1 The population \nis aging rapidly, while per capita income remains modest and social security systems are still \ndeveloping. The growing demand to create a sustainable ECS and develop adequate elderly care \nservices exceeds current supply. Developing adequate elderly care is a major government \npriority. The PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 sought to create a three-tiered ECS.2The \n \nThirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 continues to support the development of elderly care by \nfurther defining the roles of the government, private sector, and civil society organizations; and \npromoting better integration of health care and elderly care services.3 \n \n4.  Yichang is one of 42 pilot cities jointly chosen in 2014 by the Ministry of Civil Affairs and \nNational Development and Reform Commission to comprehensively develop its ECS, expand \ncoverage, and ensure adequate service provision.4 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) began \nworking with the Yichang Municipal Government (YMG) in 2014 to support its program of \ncomprehensive reform by creating the Yichang elderly care strategic plan.5In 2017, 22% of \n \nYichang Municipality\u2019s population of 4.14 million was above the age of 60, well above the 2017 \nnational average of 14.3%. Within the municipality, there is great diversity in the distribution of \nelderly and their care needs. Developing an ECS to address such complexity and demand is a \nsignificant challenge and one that is faced by many municipalities in the PRC. \n \n5.  Yichang\u2019s elderly care strategic plan for 2016\u20132030 was finalized in 2016, and has five \nstrategic directions aimed at (i) expanding coverage and range of services, (ii) ensuring financial \nsustainability, (iii) improving service quality, (iv) developing partnerships with private sector and \ncivil society organizations, and (v) strengthening human resources. The project will align with the \nYichang elderly care strategic plan, help develop Yichang\u2019s ECS, and improve services and \nhuman resources.  \n \n                                                \n1  In 2015, the government announced the lifting of the one-child policy, allowing all couples to have two children. \n2  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2011.

Beijing. \n4  Based on the Notice on Launching Pilot Work for the Comprehensive Reform of Elderly Care Services Industry \nissued in 2014 by Ministry of Civil Affairs and National Development and Reform Commission, Yichang was selected \nas a pilot city. \n5  The Yichang elderly care strategic plan was produced as the output of an ADB technical assistance to enable YMG \nto develop elderly care policies and needed care services. ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic \nof China for Strategic Elderly Care Services Development in Yichang. Manila. ", "2 \n6.  Yichang\u2019s ECS is still being developed. Home-based and community-based elderly care \nservices are underdeveloped, and available human resources are severely limited. Elderly people \nwho need care are unable to remain in their communities. Residential-based elderly care facilities \nare limited, either unable to provide adequate services (leading to low occupancy), or\u2014in the \ncase of public facilities that offer quality services at a reasonable price\u2014have long waiting lists \nand are unable to meet demand. The imbalance between demand and supply results in the \nmajority of the elderly receiving little assistance, if any. \n \n7.  The project will help YMG establish a comprehensive, three-tiered elderly care service \nprovision by developing (i) home-based and community-based elderly care services and facilities \nand adequate residential care services to help address the care needs of a broad elderly \npopulation; (ii) elderly care service capacity, and human resources and associated support \nsystem for elderly care; (iii) facilities and services for geriatric and rehabilitation care to address \nunmet needs and support the integration of health care and elderly care services; and (iv) the \ncapacity of elderly care management.6 \n \n8.  Strategic fit. The project supports the thirteenth five-year plans, 2016\u20132020 of the PRC \n(footnote 3), Hubei, and YMG, which seek to develop a three-tiered elderly care system and \nstimulate investment in the sector; and the Healthy China 2030 strategy plan that highlights the \nissue of health as a critical development challenge in the PRC.7 It is in line with ADB\u2019s (i) country \npartnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2016\u20132020,  in  particular  the  focus  on  inclusive  growth; \n(ii) Operational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020, which has elderly care as a focus area; (iii) Strategy \n2030, as improving the quality and coverage of elderly care services is key to address the \noperational priority of reducing poverty and inequality, particularly the areas of achieving better \nhealth for all and ensuring social protection for those in need. It is also aligned with the operational \npriority on accelerating progress in gender since majority of the care givers and beneficiaries of \nelderly care services are women; and (iv) sustainable development goals 3 (good health and \nwellbeing), 8 (decent work and economic growth), and 13 (climate action).  \n \n9.  ADB value addition. Since 2014, ADB supports the PRC\u2019s local governments to promote \nelderly care service development (footnote 5). Through a comprehensive approach, ADB helped \nYMG establish its ECS. Based on the Yichang elderly care strategic plan, an ADB lending project \nwas prepared in 2016 to help Yichang develop a public\u2013private partnership model to strengthen \nthe provision of residential elderly care services by enhancing private sector involvement in the \nprovision  of  services.8 The  project  complements  the  public\u2013private  partnership  project  and \npresents a comprehensive approach to develop a three-tiered elderly care system in Yichang. \nThe project will develop a demonstrative case to adapt to the aging population by helping establish \na comprehensive ECS, which will have an essential knowledge transfer impacts on other cities in \nthe PRC and in other developing member countries.9 \n                                                \n6  In addition, this project is designed with climate change adaptation and mitigation measures to respond to potential \nvulnerabilities. Without proper climate and flood-proofing measures, elderly people accommodated in facilities are \nvulnerable to extremes of temperature and other extreme climate events such as flooding. \n7  Government of Hubei Province. 2015.

Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: a three-tiered elderly care system (home-\nbased, community-based, and residential-based care services) established.10 The project will \nhave  the  following  outcome:  coverage  and  utilization  of  elderly  care  services  in  Yichang \nincreased.11 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  Output 1: Home-based and community-based care services and facilities improved. \nOutput 1 will (i) help identify and strengthen appropriate home-based and community-based day \ncare services with short-stay care, and (ii) rehabilitate or construct facilities for community-based \nelderly care centers (CECCs).12 \n \n12.  Output 2: Elderly care service capacity increased and its support system improved. \nOutput 2 will (i) improve dementia care service capacity and construct a dementia care center;13 \n(ii) develop  an  elderly  care\u2013information  and  communication  technology  platform,  which  will \nsupport the exchange of information, monitor elderly care services, and link elderly care and \nhealth care services; and (iii) strengthen the training capacity of elderly care training institutions \n(Three Gorges College, and the Caregiver and Manager Training and Career Center) to meet the \ndemands for human resources in the elderly care sector. \n \n13.  Output 3: Facilities and services supporting the integration of health care and \nelderly care established. Output 3 will (i) strengthen geriatric care functions by constructing a \nsecondary-level geriatric hospital and expanding the geriatric capacity of a tertiary-level hospital, \nand (ii) construct an elderly care nursing home with basic health care functions to support the \ncontinuity of care for the elderly in need. \n \n14.  Output 4: Capacity of elderly care management and project management support \ndeveloped. Output 4 includes (i) capacity development support to strengthen the management \ncapacity of the Yichang Civil Affairs Bureau which is responsible for the elderly care sector,  and \nstrengthen other related bureaus and agencies to develop and operate an ECS in Yichang;14 \n(ii) elderly care-related technical support to ensure that designs of respective elderly care or \nmedical facilities and respective functions and services to be delivered under each facility are \ntechnically appropriate; and (iii) project management support for executing and implementing \nagencies and project implementing entities (PIEs) to manage and implement the project. \n \n                                                \n10 Government of the PRC, State Council. 2013.

Beijing. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n12 Home-based delivery care services typically cover care for activities of daily living (ADL), such as bathing and \nfeeding, as well as instrumental ADL, such as shopping and managing medications. Caregivers visit homes of elderly \npeople to provide those care for ADL and/or instrumental ADL. Day care services would provide care for ADL for \nthose elderly people who come to the CECCs. Home-based care and day care would enable family members to \nreturn to the labor market, or for elderly who do not have family members to stay home or visit CECCs to receive \nthose needed care services.   \n13 The number of people with dementia in the PRC was estimated to be about 9.6 million in 2010, and projected to \nreach 14.1 million by 2020 and 23.3 million by 2030.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  YMG will be the executing agency. Under YMG, the Yichang project management office \n(YPMO) has been set up to coordinate with concerned bureaus and agencies, and supervise \noverall project implementation and management. Chaired by the vice mayor of YMG, the project \nleading group has been set up as a steering committee to provide the overall project direction and \noversee project implementation. \n \n20.  YCJT Group Kangyang Industry Investment Co. Ltd., (JTKY) will be the implementing \nagency and will be responsible for overall project implementation.17 It will set up a project financial \naccount; and compile and maintain all project administration-related documents and statements \nfor project administration, auditing, and evaluation. \n \n21.  In addition to JTKY, five PIEs will be responsible for day-to-day administration of certain \nproject components, including the expansion of the geriatric section of the Second People\u2019s \nHospital of Yichang (SPH); and construction of CECCs in Yiling District, Yidu County, Zhijiang \nCounty, and Zigui County. Under the supervision of YPMO, all PIEs will submit required project \ndocuments to JTKY. \n \n22.  A procurement plan is included in the PAM. Goods, works, and consulting services \nprocured under the project will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from \ntime to time), and ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). YMG requested that ADB approve advance contracting for procurement of goods, works, \nand consulting services, including preparation of bid documents, inviting and receiving bids, and \nretroactive  financing  under  the  project.  Retroactive  financing  will  be  allowed  for  eligible \nexpenditures up to 20% of the loan amount incurred prior to loan effectiveness, but not earlier \nthan 12 months before the date of loan agreement. The YMG and YPMO were advised that ADB\u2019s \napproval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance any \npart of the project. \n \n23.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  The project was found to be technically feasible following careful examination of the \nproject\u2019s compatibility with local conditions and capacity for operation and maintenance. Design \noptions were compared and least-cost alternatives were selected. The facilities were designed in \naccordance with relevant PRC standards and regulations. The architectural design incorporates \ninternational and national good practices, and follows community-based, elderly care-focused, \nefficient, and inclusive principles. Low carbon and resource-efficient measures, including solar \nhot water systems, intelligent lighting control, and passive energy-saving designs will be adopted. \nThe proposed capacity development component was prepared based on a needs assessment for \nthe successful implementation and sustainable operation of the project facilities. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  The project proposes to build elderly care facilities and capacity to provide comprehensive \nelderly care services that are urgently needed in the rapidly aging Yichang Municipality. The \nproject applied the cost-effectiveness approach to the economic analysis in accordance with ADB \nguidelines.18 Therefore, the economic analysis analyzed the cost-effectiveness of the capital \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila (page 6). \n ", "7 \ninvestments in the community-based elderly care centers, dementia care center, elderly care \nnursing home, two hospitals (SPH and Three Gorges Hospital), and training facility of Caregiver \nand Manager Training and Career Center. It compared two scenarios to assess if the project \nminimizes resource use to achieve the desired results\u2014in this case, the number of elderly people \nserviced for a given budget and life cycle cost. The alternative scenario considered alternatives \nin terms of site or building design. The results of the cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the \nalternative project would cost CNY876.68 million more during the 25-year operation period than \nthe project scenario, making the project the more cost-effective option. \n \n26.  Financial analysis was undertaken to determine the financial viability of the revenue- \ngenerating components and the fiscal sustainability of the relevant local governments to provide \ncounterpart funding for the project in accordance with ADB guidelines.19 The financial internal rate \nof return was calculated for the two hospitals (SPH and Three Gorges Hospital) and compared with \nthe weighted average cost of capital. The financial internal rate of return of 8.2% shows the two \nfacilities are financially viable when considered in combination, while a range of sensitivity tests \nconfirmed these components would remain viable in the face of adverse conditions. A fiscal \nsustainability analysis was conducted for other components of elderly care-related facilities for the \ngovernments of Yichang Municipality, Yiling District, and Yidu County, which showed that total \nproject incremental costs will have a negligible impact on the budgets of these governments, thus \nconfirming their fiscal sustainability. The maximum impact of incremental costs will be less than \n0.8% of the respective local governments\u2019 annual fiscal revenues. YMG will be responsible for the \nsustainable operation of the elderly care facilities by providing subsidies if needed. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n27.  Financial  management  assessment.  The  financial  management  assessment  was \nconducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  (footnote  19).  It  considered  the  financial \nmanagement capacity of Hubei Provincial Finance Department, YMG, JTKY, and PIEs. The \nassessment  covered  funds  flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting \nsystems, internal and external auditing arrangements, and financial information systems. Hubei \nProvincial  Finance  Department  and  YMG  have  experience  in  implementing  ADB-financed \nprojects and have sufficient knowledge of ADB policies and procedures, including the use of an \nadvance  fund  account and  in  administering  the  statement  of  expenditures  procedure. The \nfinancial management risk has been assessed as moderate mainly because the implementing \nagency and five PIEs have no experience implementing ADB projects; and their staff will need to \nbe familiarized with ADB policies and procedures. Mitigation measures to address identified \ndeficiencies have been agreed with the executing and implementing agencies and PIEs. The \nproposed financial management actions are included in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \n28.  Procurement risk assessment. The procurement risk assessment was conducted in \naccordance with ADB guidelines.20 YMG has experience in managing an ADB-financed project.21 \nHowever, the implementing agency and the PIEs have no previous practical experience with ADB \nproject implementation and management, and are not familiar with ADB\u2019s procurement principles \nand regulations. Some PIEs may have insufficient human resources to handle additional ADB \nprocurement-related reporting and monitoring requirements.22 These risks will be mitigated as \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n22 Most of the procurement staff assigned are not working fulltime for the project. \n ", "8 \nfollows: (i) YMG has committed to fulfill ADB\u2019s requirements for all procurement and consultant \nrecruitment for the project; (ii) YPMO has already gained good knowledge of procurement \nmanagement during previous and ongoing ADB-financed projects; (iii) an experienced external \nprocurement  agency,  which  is  already  in  place,  will  provide  support;  and  (iv) support  for \nprocurement  activities  and  consultant  recruitment  will  also  be  provided  by  procurement \nconsultants  engaged  under  the  proposed  project.  The  overall  project  procurement  risk  is \nassessed as moderate. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, YMG, and the implementing agency. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 15).  \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  All project counties and districts, except Zigui County, have lower average poverty rates \n(5%) than the average rates in Hubei Province (7.3%) and Yichang Municipality (8.5%). The \naverage poverty rate in Zigui County is 15%, three times more than in other project counties and \ndistricts. The main economic activities in districts other than Zigui County are industries and \nbusinesses; which employ most of the population, resulting in high income levels. To ensure \nsocial inclusiveness and gender mainstreaming, YPMO will implement a social development and \ngender action plan.23 All implementation actions, monitoring indicators, responsible institutions, \ntime frame, and the budget have been discussed with the YPMO, the implementing agency, and \nPIEs. The agreed actions and arrangements are included in the social development and gender \naction plan. \n \n31.  The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. On the demand side, \namong the elderly population, women outnumber, live longer, and suffer more diseases than men. \nOn the supply side, the proportion of women responsible for informal family elderly care and as \nformal  care  workers  is  higher  than  men.  The  project  will  strengthen  elderly  care  services \nincreasing access for elderly men and women. A sound ECS will create significant employment \nand business opportunities in a service area that predominantly employs women and assists \nfamily caregivers. The project will increase the technical capacities of women in the formal elderly \ncare sector. For proper service provision, sex-disaggregated data collection of elderly care \nservices will be implemented. Targets for women\u2019s participation in jobs generated by the project \nduring construction and operation have been established. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n32.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.24 \n \n33.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination (IEE), including an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), was prepared and disclosed on the ADB website on \n19 July  2018.25 The  EMP  identified  potential  environmental  impacts  and  risks  for  the  pre-\nconstruction, construction, and operational phases; and proposed mitigation measures. The IEE \nconcluded that the anticipated environmental impacts are insignificant and temporary, and can be \n                                                \n23 Social Development and Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n25 The IEE is based on a  domestic environmental impact assessment written in Chinese and approved by the Yichang \nEnvironmental Protection Bureau, which was disclosed on the YMG website on 27 March 2018. \n ", "9 \nmitigated through EMP implementation. Construction of 2 proposed geriatric hospitals, an elderly \ncare nursing home, a dementia care center, and 16 CECCs is expected to have minor impacts \non air and water quality, solid waste management, and soil and groundwater contamination during \nconstruction  and  operational  stages;  which  can  be  adequately  mitigated  through  EMP \nimplementation and monitoring. Medical waste management due diligence\u2014addressing storage, \ntransportation, treatment, and associated facilities\u2014found safeguards procedures and operations \nto  be  adequate  and  strictly  followed,  and  in  compliance  with  both  PRC  and  international \nregulations.  YMG  confirmed  its  commitment  and  capacity  to  implement  the  EMP.  Further \ncapacity-building measures were proposed in the EMP and agreed by YMG. A grievance redress \nmechanism will be established. The procedures, reporting timelines, and roles and responsibilities \nof all agencies are described in the EMP. YMG has full responsibility for safeguards oversight and \nEMP implementation and compliance. \n \n34.  Climate change. A climate risk and vulnerability assessment confirmed that all project \nsites are at medium risk from climate change impacts. YMG, the implementing agency, and the \nPIEs will ensure that the detailed project designs incorporate engineering design adjustments \nderived from the assessment results as proactive adaptation measures. The principal measures \nto mitigate predicted climate events comprise anti-flooding designs and evacuation. Heating and \ncooling systems will be installed in all project facilities (to help elderly people and practitioners \nadapt to extreme temperature conditions). Preserving existing buildings, using renewable energy, \nand resource saving are the three main methods to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project will acquire 6.28 hectares (ha) of \nland, 4.19 ha of collectively owned land, and 2.09 ha of state-owned land. A total of 15,313 square \nmeters  (m2)  of  houses  will  be  demolished,  including  residential  houses  (5,433  m2)  and \nnonresidential buildings of three enterprises (about 9,880 m2). The 269 affected persons include \n(i) 170 persons in 44 households, (ii) 51 employees in three enterprises, and (iii) 4 renters with \n48 persons. Three households with 10 persons will lose their residential houses because of the \ndemolition  or  the  conversion  to  CECCs.  Land  acquisition  will  affect  23  households  with \n88 persons, and 18 households with 72 persons will be affected by land acquisition and demolition. \nThe YMG will be responsible for compensation and provision of support and assistance prior to \nland acquisition and relocation activities. Affected persons do not rely on agriculture for their \nlivelihoods,  and  the  area  of  land  lost  is  too  small  to  impact  household  incomes.  Land \ncompensation payments will be considerable. Those who lose houses will be offered cash \ncompensation at replacement cost or resettlement housing from the local government, and \nbuilding compensation will enable them to purchase houses equal in size to their original houses. \nThe three affected enterprises will receive negotiated prices before project implementation. The \nfour  affected  renters  with  48  persons  will  be  compensated  according  to  their  contractual \narrangements. The project team has informed the affected business owners and their employees \nwhen the properties will be acquired, and the local government will help them find new locations \nto continue their business activities. The project will provide skilled and unskilled job opportunities \non a priority basis for all project-affected persons during construction and operation. \n \n36.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  PRC  has  preferential  policies  for  ethnic \nminorities, to ensure they participate in service administration and development programs, and \nmanage their internal affairs. Ethnic minorities account for less than 1% of the population in the \nproject impact areas. Most of the ethnic minorities in project impact areas (87%) are from the \nTujia ethnic minority group, who share similar economic opportunities and social recognition with \nthe  PRC's  dominant  Han  population. The  project  will  ensure  elderly  people,  regardless  of \nethnicity, gain equal access to elderly care services based on care needs, and that their cultural \nand religious sensitivities are recognized and elderly care providers accommodate any special \n ", "10 \ndietary requirements. Ethnic minorities associate well with other communities and will equally \nbenefit from the project. Therefore, an ethnic minority development plan is not needed. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n37.  The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nThe overall risk is rated moderate. Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in \nTable 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.26 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nPIEs have insufficient qualified staff to  YMG will ensure that PIEs have sufficient staff for project \nundertake project procurement  implementation.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n38.  The government and YMG have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n39.  The government and YMG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan agreement and project agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n40.
