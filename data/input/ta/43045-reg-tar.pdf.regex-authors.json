INTRODUCTION \n1.  The 14 Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) are either fragile states or exhibit strong characteristics of fragility.1 Weak economic \nperformance  contributes  to  this  fragility,  which  is  linked  to  shortcomings  in  policy  and \ninstitutional environments as highlighted by ADB\u2019s country performance assessments. For these \nDMCs,  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020)  posits,  \u201cdue  to \ngenerally  weak  policy  regimes,  their  often  small  size,  economic  vulnerability,  and  weak \ninstitutions\u2026ADB must seek innovative means to strengthen the effectiveness of country-led \nmodels of engagement.\u201d2  \n \n2.  As part of the Pacific Studies Series, the expected impacts of the global financial and \neconomic crisis and a sensible policy response were presented in an October 2008 policy brief3 \nreleased by ADB. The publication received wide coverage in the region, including at the October \n2008 Pacific Forum Economic Ministers\u2019 Meeting. ADB has subsequently helped coordinate a \nprocess among the region\u2019s development partners aimed at helping Pacific DMCs respond to \nthe global crisis. Consultation has shown there is strong demand for assistance among the \nPacific DMCs most exposed to the adverse impacts of the global crisis. \n \n3.  This  proposed  regional  cluster  technical  assistance  (TA)  responds  to  these  above \nchallenges by adopting innovative approaches to assist economic management in the Pacific. It \nwill help Pacific DMCs improve economic monitoring and the formulation and implementation of \neconomic policy. Specifically, the first cluster will provide ADB's initial support for a country-led \nresponse to the global financial and economic crisis. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Long-term growth rates are low in most Pacific economies, and for most of the region's \npopulation, the long-term process of structural transformation is either absent or has stalled.5 \nThe  poor  growth  outcomes  can  be  traced  back  to  a  history  of  heavy-handed  economic \nmanagement that manifested in large, inefficient public sectors and excessive barriers to private \nsector  development.  In  the  1990s,  most  Pacific  DMC  governments  adopted  structural \nadjustment programs to open economies and to modernize economic management. These \nprograms demonstrated gains from such change, with moderate rates of economic growth when \nimprovements were sustained. However, the results from these efforts have remained below \nexpectations.  \n \n5.  Key constraints lie in the institutional setting, with the prevailing political economy in \nparticular  imposing  a  binding  constraint  to  improved  economic  performance.6 This  is  most \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

The \n14 Pacific DMCs are the Cook Islands, the Fiji Islands, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of \nMicronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, and \nVanuatu. \n2  ADB. 2008.

Pacific Economic Bulletin 23 (2): 230\u2013238. \n ", "2   \nevident in the frequent need to repeat externally funded policy analyses and advice, and the \nslow progress of many governments to meet their public commitments to improved economic \nmanagement. \n \n6.  This experience forewarns that a concerted, innovative effort will be required to help \nlessen the impact of the global financial and economic crisis on the region. Lower commodity \nprices have already reduced export incomes, and tourism and remittances are easing as source \neconomies  face  tougher  economic  conditions.  The  value  of  most  of  the  region\u2019s  offshore \ninvestment funds, held by national trust funds and the region\u2019s superannuation schemes, have \ndeclined substantially.  \n \n7.  If a timely and effective response is to be made, extra effort will be needed to improve \nthe flow of economic information, to use better economic indicators, and to reduce time lags in \neconomic monitoring. Support will also be needed to analyze the impacts of the global crisis on \nthe Pacific DMCs and to prepare policy responses. The economic agencies of the Pacific DMCs \nmost exposed to the adverse impacts of the global crisis have advised that they would welcome \nhelp from development partners to strengthen their economic analysis and to respond best to \nthe global crisis. \n \n8.  Innovative efforts will be needed to trigger constructive policy and institutional change in \nPacific DMCs. These efforts need to build on sensitive, long-term relationships between these \ncountries and their development partners, and among advisors, reformers, and those impacted \nby reform. Above all, to be successful, assistance for improved economic management needs to \nbe tailored to meet individual circumstances and to encourage local ownership and control. \n \n9.  There are some recent examples of the potential economic benefits from policy and \ninstitutional adaptation. Successes have typically been characterized by local commitment that \nled  to  a  locally  driven  effort.  Consultative  and  participatory  processes,  open  debate,  and \ninformation sharing assisted the achievement of these helpful changes.7 In addition, successful \nreform in aviation and mobile telecommunications, which allowed new and lower-cost entrants, \nshow that alternative approaches to economic management can quickly boost economic growth \nand development. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The proposed TA is to strengthen the capacity of Pacific DMCs to manage for inclusive \neconomic  growth\u2014specifically,  to  assist  Pacific  DMCs  in  using  improved  economic \nmanagement processes. This is to be achieved by assistance that offers longer-term benefits by \nhelping develop existing Pacific DMC systems and processes for economic management and \nthe individual capacity of the region\u2019s economic managers. The proposed TA will help address \nlong-standing institutional constraints to change by encouraging demand for better economic \nmanagement. Support is to focus on topical economic issues to capitalize on episodes of \ndemand for improved economic management. Innovative modalities will be pursued, including \nthe use of a mentoring approach and support for coalitions for change. A cluster TA is proposed \nas a means of progressively raising the intensity of engagement through subprojects linked by a \nconsistent approach to achieving change. \n                                                 \n7  As  documented  in  ADB\u2019s  recent  Capacity  Development  Series  (www.adb.org/Documents/Studies/  Capacity-\nDevelopment-in-the-Pacific/default.asp). \n ", "  3\n11.  Assistance would be provided to Pacific DMCs that demonstrate an appreciation of the \nneed to take action to improve economic management. The proposed TA must nevertheless be \nconservative in expectations given the tight limits on capacity, the shortage of experience in \nsuccessful implementation of economic management, and the small amount of funds available \nper country. \n \n12.  Subproject 1 is to focus on a response to the global financial and economic crisis. The \nsubproject provides for ADB\u2019s contribution to a joint effort by development partners to help \nPacific DMCs lessen the effects of the global crisis through improved economic monitoring, \npolicy analysis, and dialogue. \n \n13.  The initiation of future subprojects will await the emergence of opportunities to pursue \ndemand-driven improvements. Future subprojects will continue efforts to improve economic \nmanagement. Modern, strategic management approaches from other regions, such as support \nfor  the  capacity  development  of  coalitions  for  change  or  variants  of  corporate  change \nmanagement, will be applied more intensively with a view to adapting modern approaches to \nPacific DMC circumstances. Efforts will be made throughout the proposed TA to help civil \nsociety increase their engagement in economic issues. However, should risk factors eventuate \nand the progress of subproject 1 be inadequate, additional clusters could be brought forward to \npursue innovative approaches to mobilizing change toward improved economic management \nprocesses. Such action would be matched by extra efforts to ensure government commitment to \nthe TA. \n \n14.  Performance of the proposed TA will be established via demonstrated improvements in \neconomic management consistent with international good practices, taking into account regional \nand national circumstances, as assessed through economic reporting.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The planned outputs of the proposed TA are: \n(i)  adoption of an expanded set of economic indicators, including lead indicators \nwhere feasible; \n(ii)  preparation of economic review assessments; and \n(iii)  high-level  inputs  to  economic  policy  formulation  generated  through  periodic  \nin-country and regional high-level dialogues. \n \n16.  Subproject 1, Response to the Global Crisis, will provide for highly experienced mentors \nto guide Pacific DMC decision makers and senior economic advisers. Mentors will apply key \nlessons learned from the Pacific and other regions toward successful economic reform. Coupled \nwith the demand for improved economic management that is expected to arise as the global \ncrisis expands to the region, the subproject is expected to offer improvements on traditional \napproaches.  \n \n17.  The work of the mentors (to be appointed as lead advisers) will be supported by advisers \nand  economic  analysts.  The  provision  of  this  technical  support  recognizes  the  additional \nworkload imposed on Pacific DMC economic agencies by the global crisis and the need to fill \nsome gaps in expertise. Support will be provided to take full advantage of opportunities for  \non-the-job learning and to transfer needed skills to maximize prospects of sustainability. Where \nsupport by international consultants is to be provided through repeated visits, progress between \nvisits will be used to assess local capacity and ongoing engagement. \n \n ", "4   \n18.  In addition to supporting country-level dialogue, subproject 1 will provoke structured and \ntargeted regional dialogue that brings together the heads of treasuries and ministries of finance, \ncentral banks, and market regulators and supervisors. This will help decision makers define \ntheir own policy position by sharing experiences and debating policy issues, many of which will \nbe common across the region. As much as possible, support for regional dialogue will be joined \nto other regional events. \n \n19.  A Pacific economic monitor will be prepared as a compilation of data and economic \nanalysis of the impact of the global crisis and proposed policy responses. The monitor is to be \nused to help underpin the analytical content of policy dialogue, and will be widely disseminated \nto raise public awareness of key public policy issues. The economic monitor is to provide a link \nbetween subproject 1 and the policy agenda of relevant regional economic fora. \n \n20.  Support from subproject 1 will be tailored to the emerging needs of each Pacific DMC. \nThe  intention  is  to  supplement  existing  monitoring  to  offer  longer-term  benefits  from  the \nassistance rather than to create a separate, once-off donor activity.8 Country-level assistance \nwill be provided in response to a request from Pacific DMCs that spells out the need for support \nand  links  the  request  to  existing  activities,  both  own  and  development  partner-funded. \nPreference will be given to economic agencies that show how staff members will benefit from \nsupport in an effort to share capacity development support and to lessen the risk that high staff \nturnover will erode sustainability. \n \n21.  The prospects of sustainability will also be enhanced by focusing support on central \nbanks  in  close  cooperation  with  other  donors,  including  the  International  Monetary  Fund's \nPacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre. Central banks have a direct policy responsibility \nand standing within Pacific DMCs and a demonstrated capacity to raise performance and to \nimprove economic management.9 They provide a good basis for developing the coalitions for \nchange needed to raise the standard of economic management. Where central banks are not \npresent, the focus of support will be on the economic areas of treasuries and ministries of \nfinance.  \n \n22.  It is anticipated that funds will be used most effectively if operations are concentrated in \nabout five Pacific DMCs, complemented by a rapid-response and regional support function that \ncan also assist other Pacific DMCs as needs arise. Resource allocations will be responsive to \nthe presence of local ownership, prospects for sustainability, the vulnerability of Pacific DMC \neconomies  to  the  global  crisis,  and  whether  other  development  partner  activities  (new  or \nexisting) can instead accommodate a response to the global crisis. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n23.  The total cost of the proposed TA is estimated at $3.5 million equivalent. It is proposed \nthat ADB provide $3.0 million equivalent on a grant basis. Pacific DMC governments will finance \nthe remaining $0.5 million equivalent. The proposed TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program (TA Special Fund IV). Cost estimates and the financing plan are \nprovided in Appendix 2.  \n \n                                                 \n8  Support is to build on the framework presented in ADB. 2009.

Implementation Arrangements \n24.  ADB\u2019s Pacific Department will be the Executing Agency for the proposed TA as well as \nthe  implementing  agency  for  subproject  1.  Funds  for  regional  conferences,  seminars,  and \ntraining  events  will  be  administered  by  the  Pacific  Department.  Implementation  will  be \nharmonized with the activities of other development partners, principally via the continuation of \ndevelopment partner coordination meetings and the establishment of a TA steering committee \ncomprising key development partners, the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre, and \nthe Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat.10 \n \n25.  Consultants will be engaged under subproject 1 on an intermittent basis of 3\u20139 months. \nAreas of expertise will include economic management and the closely related fields of public \npolicy, including economic statistics. A range of experience levels and skills will be engaged to \nallow support to be tailored to the needs of each Pacific DMC. In addition to the team leader, up \nto 5 lead advisers, 5 advisers, and 15 economic analysts will be engaged. Expected results \ninclude improved economic monitoring frameworks, policy analysis and advice, and the transfer \nof capacity to participating agencies in the Pacific DMCs. An outline of the terms of reference is \nprovided in Appendix 3.  \n \n26.  Consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). TA consultants will be engaged \non an individual basis in order to facilitate a rapid and flexible response to the global crisis, the \ntopical issues to be explored by follow-on subprojects, and the engagement of specialists in \neconomic management who are highly regarded in the region. \n \n27.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook,11 as amended from time to time. The TA is estimated to \nstart in June 2009 and be completed in June 2011. \n \n28.  The main outputs will be disseminated widely at regional conferences, at other fora, and \nin the regional press to keep the public informed of key public policy issues and to help mobilize \npublic support for improved economic management. The Pacific economic monitor will provide a \nkey conduit for communicating economic and policy analysis prepared under the proposed TA. \nOutcome evaluation will be undertaken with the assistance of the steering committee. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n29.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $3,000,000 on a grant basis for Pacific Economic Management. \n \n                                                 \n10 ADB hosted development partner coordination meetings on a global crisis response on 4 December 2008 and 27 \nFebruary 2009 at the Pacific Coordination Liaison Office in Sydney, Australia. Attendees were the Australian \nAgency for International Development, the New Zealand\u2019s International Aid & Development Agency, the Pacific \nFinancial Technical Assistance Centre, the World Bank, and (at the 27 February meeting) the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme. The meetings provided a forum for the sharing of information and the coordination of \ndevelopment partner activities, including the prioritization of activities and the integration of a response to the global \ncrisis with other activities. \n11 ADB. 2008.

Subproject 1: Response to the Global Crisis \n1.  The  first  subproject\u2014Response  to  the  Global  Crisis\u2014of  the  Pacific  Economic \nManagement technical assistance (TA) project will support economic monitoring, analysis, and \npolicy advice by Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) in a joint effort with development \npartners.  Given  the  recent  emergence  of  the  global  economic  and  financial  crisis,  and \nuncertainty as to its depth and duration, the needs of Pacific DMCs are still being assessed. The \nresponse of development partners is also in its formative stages; consequently, the following \nresources requirements and terms of reference are indicative only. \n \n2.  A  mix  of  individual  international  and  national  consultants  will  support  Pacific  DMC \neconomic agencies in strengthening economic monitoring systems and supplementing these \nsystems with indicators tailored to the likely impact of the global crisis on each Pacific DMC. \nThis  information  will  be  used  to  provide  higher-quality  advice  to  Pacific  DMCs  and  the \nappropriate response of economic management.  \n \n3.  The makeup of assistance will be determined by the impact of the global crisis on each \nPacific DMC, capacities of each Pacific DMC, the case put forward by each Pacific DMC for \nachieving sustainable impact from the TA (e.g., a group of staff members who will benefit from \nsupport to minimize the impact of staff turnover), and the availability of national and international \nconsultants. The consultants will have a proven ability to review and analyze policy as well as \nform normative policy prescriptions that are consistent with achieving inclusive growth through \nsound institutional arrangements. They will have excellent oral and written skills in English, and \nhave publishing experience. Proficiency in the use of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) style \nguidelines will also be beneficial. \n \n4.  The  policy  and  technical  analysis  will  draw  on  relevant  international  and  regional \nliterature, data, and analyses, including (i) Pacific DMC national plans and national strategies; (ii) \nthe reports and assessments of other development partners; (iii) the Pacific Studies Series, \nincluding Pacific island economic reports; and (iv) ADB project, sector, and thematic reports. \nAnalysis will pay close attention to lessons learned from similar activities undertaken in the past \nto maximize the potential impact and to minimize risk. Efforts will be made to assist Pacific DMC \neconomic managers in publicly disseminating key findings from the technical analysis to help \ncommunities affected by the crisis mitigate adverse impacts and engage in preparation for a \nresponse. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s Pacific Department, and specifically desk officers and desk economists in the \nPacific DMC resident missions, will coordinate the consultant input, including liaising with Pacific \nDMCs, other departments within ADB, and development partners. They will also coordinate with \nindividual  country  program  managers  of  other  development  partners  as  appropriate.  The \ncountry economist (Pacific Operations Division) will have overall responsibility for the subproject. \n \n6.  The work will be undertaken in a phased manner, with research and analyses oriented to \nassisting  informed,  local  participation  in  the  formulation  of  future  phases  of  support.  The \nindividual consultants will coordinate their work schedules and engage, to the maximum extent \nfeasible, with civil society and staff of Pacific DMC economic agencies including treasuries and \n ", "10   Appendix 3 \nministries of finance, central banks, planning offices, or units and statistic bureaus in each \nPacific DMC, as appropriate. \n \n7.
