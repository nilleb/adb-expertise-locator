THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  India  for  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Urban  Services  Improvement  Project.1 The  report  also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Development of Institutions in the \nUrban Sector of Madhya Pradesh for urban service improvement, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The  project  adopts  a  sector  approach  in  developing  (i)  sustainable,  inclusive,  and \nclimate-resilient water supply in 64 small and medium-sized towns; and (ii) integrated storm \nwater and sewerage infrastructure in two tourist towns of national heritage in Madhya Pradesh \nstate.2 The project will complement efforts of the  state government of Madhya Pradesh to \nimprove urban services by (i) increasing access to piped water supply, especially among poor \nhouseholds; (ii) reducing reliance on groundwater and ensuring more efficient use of surface \nwater; (iii) providing for long-term operation and maintenance (O&M); and (iv) building capacity. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Urban  development  and  basic  services.  Madhya  Pradesh  in  central  India  is  the \nsecond-largest state by area (308,000 square kilometers), fifth most populous (72 million), and \neighth most urbanized state in India. It is urbanizing at a faster pace (2.57% per year) than the \nnational average (2.45%), with the proportion of its urban population expected to increase from \n28% in 2016 to 35% by 2026. Despite its improving economy, Madhya Pradesh still has a \n31.0% poverty rate, and an urban poverty rate (21.0%) that is higher than India\u2019s average of \n13.7%.3 Increasing urbanization is putting more stress on urban infrastructure and urban basic \nservices. Many urban local bodies (ULBs) or local municipal boards do not have piped water \nsupply,  and  only  a  fraction  have  wastewater  and  sanitation  systems.  A  service-level \nbenchmarking assessment conducted for 110 sample ULBs by the Urban Development and \nHousing Department (UDHD) of Madhya Pradesh indicated an extremely uneven distribution of \nurban services, with small ULBs (nagar parishads or municipal boards) ranked at the bottom. \n \n4.  A 2011 survey of 378 ULBs in Madhya Pradesh noted that less than 55% of households \nhave access to piped water supply.4 About 60% of households with piped water connections \nhave intermittent water supply (from 30 minutes to 2 hours per day), and the rest have water \nonce every 2 days; some urban areas get drinking water even less frequently. Less than 2% of \npiped water supply connections are metered, and less than 45% of total consumers pay for \nwater supply. Nonrevenue water is high, and none of the cities or towns have continuous \npressurized water supply services, leading to inefficiencies and potential health risks.5 A 2013 \nstudy  showed  the  importance  of  increasing  access  to  potable  water  supply  for  poverty \nreduction: poor drinking water quality has increased the disease burden, resulting in economic \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2014.

Urban  sector  reforms.  The  state  government  has  given  high  priority  to  urban \ninfrastructure development. Previous Asian Development Bank (ADB) urban investments in \nMadhya Pradesh have improved access to safe drinking water for more than 5 million residents \nin four major cities, and the World Bank is considering a loan to support water and wastewater \nservice improvement for about 2 million residents in 18 secondary cities.7 Learning from past \ncentral and state government-sponsored programs, Madhya Pradesh has committed to provide \nsustainable, inclusive, and quality urban services. Mission 8 of Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Vision 2018 \naims  to  provide  universal  water  supply  coverage  and  implement  reforms  to  improve  the \nefficiency  of  service  delivery  in  the  drinking  water  supply  sector.8 To  improve  long-term \nsustainability and cost recovery for urban services O&M, the state government has set up the \nMadhya  Pradesh  Urban  Development  Company  Limited  (MPUDC)  to  manage  the  urban \nprojects. The MPUDC will create urban infrastructure assets and ensure the sustainable O&M of \nthe created assets. \n \n6.  Need for a sector improvement project. The state government has initiated programs \nto improve urban services in 250 of the 378 ULBs using funds from its own resources,9 the \nGovernment of India (Swachh Bharat, Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation \n[AMRUT], and Smart City initiative),10 and external agencies. The state government sought \nADB\u2019s support to improve water supply in the remaining 128 ULBs, which had a population of \n2.7 million as of 2011 and have limited financial resources and technical capability. The project \ntakes  a  sector  approach  to fund  64  of  these 128  towns  because  of the  large  number  of \nsubprojects  and  to  ensure  an  integrated  focus  on  sector  policies  and  the  adequacy  of \ninstitutions to formulate and manage such plans. The government has a sector development \nplan to meet the priority development needs of the urban water sector and is undertaking \nreforms to build state and ULB capacity.11 \n \n7.  The  state  government  identified  64  towns\u2014with  a  reliable  water  resource,  sound \nengineering feasibility, available land, and a commitment to O&M\u2014for the project to support.12 \nThe state government plans to approach ADB for additional funding for the remaining 64 of the \n128 towns based on lessons learned from the project implementation. The sector investments \nwill lead to increase in wastewater, which also needs to be addressed. The state government is \ncommitted to improving wastewater management in a phased manner.13 The project will also \n                                                \n6  Oxford Policy Management Asia and CRISIL. 2013.

The project\u2019s value addition. Through the development and efficient use of surface \nwater  sources,  the  project  will  preserve  groundwater  and  enhance  climate  resilience,  and \nprovide near-universal access to piped water supply in small and medium-sized towns, which \nhave a higher prevalence of poverty. It will benefit many households below the poverty line, and \nempower women by eliminating drudgery associated with fetching water from distant sources. \nBy increasing access to good-quality water with enough pressure, the project will help reduce \ninfant mortality and morbidity and the associated burdensome health expenditures. The project \nwill introduce and implement design\u2013build\u2013operate (DBO) contracts, where the contractor will \nhave to develop not only high-quality infrastructure but also efficient operations of the assets \nthrough a long-term performance-based contract for ten years. This will give adequate time for \nULBs to build their capacity to operate assets after the end of the O&M contract period. \n \n9.  The project will provide continuous water supply with emphasis on 100% metered water \nconnections, efficient water supply zoning and nonrevenue water reduction, quality water supply, \nand high customer satisfaction. It will contribute to financial sustainability of operations  by \nintroducing metering and volumetric tariff, improving efficiency via nonrevenue water reduction, \nimproving customer focus and service delivery, and building awareness and engaging with \nstakeholders. This is in line with the sustainability lessons learned from ADB\u2019s previous water \nprojects.14 The project will strengthen the management capacity of ULBs and the MPUDC, and \nimprove cost recovery. It will develop and implement (i) a regulatory framework to facilitate \nprivate sector participation in the water sector over the medium term, and (ii) sanitation safety \nplans to manage the septic tanks and expand decentralized sewage treatment in the project \ntowns. \n \n10.  The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for India (2017-2019); \nwill contribute to goal 6 of the Sustainable Development Goals; and is in line with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 for India.15 The project is consistent with the state\u2019s Twelfth \nFive-Year Plan, 2012\u2013201716 and ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan.17 \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n11.  The  impacts  of  the  project  will  be  (i)  improved  economic  growth  and  urban  living \nconditions, and (ii) reduced infant mortality in Madhya Pradesh. The outcome will be improved \nquality, coverage, efficiency, and sustainability of urban service delivery in Madhya Pradesh.18 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  Output 1: Water supply infrastructure and integrated storm water and sewage \ninfrastructure improved. This will include (i) constructing water supply facilities, using the DBO \nmodel, in 64 project towns (the facilities will comprise raw water intakes, water treatment plants, \n                                                \n14 Independent Evaluation Department. 2015.

Based on their location and size, subprojects \nin the project towns were grouped into 23 procurement packages to achieve economies of scale \nfor contract purposes. Surface water is the source in 60 towns. In the four towns that depend on \ngroundwater, the project will support groundwater recharge and its sustainable use. Activities \nunder  this  output  will  focus  on  ensuring  vulnerable  households,  below  the  poverty  line \nhouseholds, and households headed by women have continuous water supply. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Systems  to  ensure  sustainable  urban  infrastructure  operations  and \nmanagement established. The project will support the state government and the ULBs, during \nproject implementation period, in establishing and maintaining 10 years performance-based \nO&M water supply contracts. The project will engage operators on performance-based, long-\nterm  O&M  contracts,  monitor  them,  and  support  an  independent  review  of  their  services. \nConstruction of the water supply facilities is estimated to take 2 years. After this is completed, \nthe contractors of the civil works packages will provide continuous water supply to the project \ntowns for 10 years. Of the 10-year O&M contract period, ADB will finance the first few years \nprior to subproject completion, and the state government will finance the remaining O&M cost \nfor the subsequent years. The MPUDC will pay O&M costs to the contractors on a monthly \nbasis, in fixed and performance-linked variable fees, following the contract agreement. The \ncontractors will ensure that (i) there is proper metering and volumetric billing, (ii) adequate water \npressure is maintained at the consumer end (7 meters), and (iii) supplied water complies with \nnational quality standards for drinking water. The operators will establish about 20 customer \nservice centers to serve the needs of all the project towns. The ULBs\u2019 obligations include setting \nand adjusting tariffs in a timely manner, collecting revenue, and managing defaulters to ensure \ncost recovery and handling financial management for timely payments to the contractors by the \nMPUDC. During the O&M period, ULB staff will be trained in operating the assets. After the \ncontract is completed, the contractors will turn over the water supply assets to the ULBs. \n \n14.  Output 3: Capacity of Madhya Pradesh Urban Development Company and urban \nlocal bodies improved. This will include (i) setting up a geographic information system-based \nasset  management  and  service  delivery  monitoring  system;  (ii)  developing  information \ntechnology systems in 15 ULBs to assist in day-to-day management; (iii) improving septage \nmanagement in the project towns by implementing sanitation safety plans; (iv) building the \ncapacity of the MPUDC and project town ULBs to manage the DBO contracts and the assets \nafter  contract  completion;  and  (v)  raising  community  awareness  on  water  conservation, \nenvironmental protection, and hygiene practices in the project towns. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n15.  The project is estimated to cost $399 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates are in the \nproject administration manual (PAM).19 \n  \n16.  The Government of India has requested a regular loan of $275 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources to  help finance  the project. The  loan  will  have  a  25-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.15%  per  year;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  loan  and  project \n                                                \n19 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nagreements.20 Based on the straightline method, the average maturity is 15.25 years, and the \nmaturity premium payable to ADB is 0.1%. The loan will finance 68.9% of the project cost, \nincluding part of the civil works, equipment, O&M for 3 years, and consulting costs. The ADB \nloan will be onlent to the state government under the same terms as the ADB loan. The state \ngovernment will contribute $124 million, or 31.1%, of the total project cost to finance taxes and \nduties; resettlement costs; finance charges during implementation; and part of the civil works, \nequipment, and O&M for the last 7 years of the 10-year O&M contract. It will provide the loan \nproceeds and counterpart funds to the MPUDC as a grant. The state government will transfer \nthe assets created under the project to the ULBs as a combination of grant (82.5%) and loan \n(17.5%) after construction, and will assume the foreign exchange risk.

The proposed TA will support capacity development of institutions in the urban sector of \nMadhya Pradesh. 21 It will have three outputs: (i) septage management in the project towns \nimproved by implementing sanitation safety plans; (ii) capacity of the MPUDC and ULBs in the \nproject towns developed to manage the DBO contracts and to manage assets after contract \ncompletion; and (iii) awareness-raising activities relating to water preservation, environmental \nprotection, and hygiene awareness conducted in the project towns. The TA is estimated to cost \n$1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special \nFund  (TASF-others).  The  state  government  will  provide  counterpart  staff,  office  space, \nworkshop venues, and other in-kind contributions. MPUDC will be the executing agency for the \nTA, which will be implemented over 3 years. \n \n                                                \n21 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n19.  The MPUDC has recruited qualified design consultants to undertake subproject surveys \nand  investigations  for  preparing  detailed  design  reports  that  include  evaluating  alternative \ntechno-economic options. A water resource review committee and a technical review committee \nhave been established to review surface water source sustainability and the most appropriate \ntechno-economic solutions considering full life-cycle costs. The PMC has been recruited to \nvalidate the detailed engineering designs submitted by the DBO contractor. \n \n20.  The project includes performance-based DBO contracts with a 10-year O&M period, \nwhich will improve construction quality and mitigate the ULBs\u2019 weak O&M capacity by providing \ncontinuity in system operation. The PMC will monitor the construction and initial operation \nservices to ensure low nonrevenue water and proper asset management. MPUDC will recruit an \nindependent performance monitoring and review body to review the contractors\u2019 performance \nand  employers\u2019  obligations  over  the  operation  service  period.  The  cost  of  house  service \nconnections and asset replacement during operation services has been capitalized and included \nin the DBO contracts. With state government support, the ULBs are obligated with periodical \ntariff setting, collection for O&M cost recovery, and providing sufficient funds for sustainable \nservice delivery and optimal maintenance of the assets created.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  Economic analysis. The economic analysis was conducted for the two sample towns \nfor which detailed designs were completed: water supply and drainage subprojects in Khajuraho \nand water supply subproject in Sagar. The estimated economic internal rates of return for the \ntwo sample towns are 12.1%\u201313.3%, higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital \n(estimated at 12.0%), indicating sufficient economic return. The results of the sensitivity analysis \nare not satisfactory against (i) capital costs overrun by 20%, (ii) O&M costs overrun by 20%, (iii) \nbenefits decrease by 20%, and (iv) combined worst scenario. However, it is expected that the \nproposed subprojects will secure economic viability even in those cases as a result of the \nunquantifiable benefits, including the improvement of environment quality and increase in land \nvalue, which are not reflected in the analysis.22 \n \n22.  Financial analysis. The financial internal rates of return for the project, calculated on \nthe basis of income from water and sewerage tariffs, are negative since the water tariffs are \nexpected to recover partial O&M costs only. A cash flow analysis of ULBs, including revenues \nfrom property tax and institutionalized transfers from the state government, is more relevant and \nconfirms that project cities have the financial capacity to sustain infrastructure and deliver the \nservices upon introduction of volumetric tariff in FY2020.23 Sample ULBs\u2019 financial projections \ndemonstrate  that,  with  (i)  rationalizing  the  tariffs,  (ii)  improving  collection  efficiency,  (iii) \nrecovering arrears with adequate provisioning for bad debts, (iv) computerizing operations and \nfinancial management, and (v) continued government support, the revenue account will remain \nin surplus. The 10-year performance-based O&M contract partly funded under the loan and \nother reforms built into the project will help ULBs improve financial sustainability. \n \n                                                \n22 Economic Analysis and Subproject Cost and Benefit Flow Stream (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n23 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  A financial management assessment of the UDHD, MPUDC, and six sample ULBs show \nthat the overall risk is substantial, primarily because the newly established MPUDC needs to \nquickly  become  operational  to  implement  the  project.24 The  ULBs  are  small  and  have \ncomparatively  lower  capacity.  However,  a  number  of  key  staff  members  with  significant \nexperience in implementing donor-funded projects from the existing project management unit \n(PMU) at the UDHD were transferred to the MPUDC. A financial management action plan has \nbeen prepared to guide the PMU and project implementation units on financial management, \nwhich includes setting up financial accounting, reporting, audit, and management information \nsystems in the MPUDC; adopting and implementing various municipal reforms; and providing \ntraining and capacity building support to all relevant staff. \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \ndiscussed with the governments of India and Madhya Pradesh, and the UDHD. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \nBased on the risk assessments, some of the mitigation measures in the project design aim to (i) \nestablish  a  mechanism  for  regular  voluntary  disclosure  of  project-related  information  to \nresidents,  (ii)  maintain  an  e-procurement  system  to  enhance  transparency  in  project \nimplementation, and (iii) establish a grievance redress mechanism to ensure quick and effective \nresolution. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n25.  The project will contribute to poverty reduction by developing infrastructure, improving \nquality  of  life,  reducing  drudgery  of  women,  reducing  health  morbidity  and  related  health \nexpenditures, and stimulating economic growth. It will improve sanitation and drainage systems, \nespecially in low-income households and slums in Khajuraho and Rajnagar.25 \n \n26.  Gender. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The gender action \nplan has clear targets, responsibilities, and resource allocation.26 Awareness raising campaigns \non water conservation, environmental protection, and hygiene will specifically target at least \n50% participation from women and girls. Grievance redress committees will have at least 30% \nwomen representatives. Women will comprise at least 30% of the participants to the MPUDC \nand ULBs\u2019 capacity building training on DBO management. Women will comprise at least half of \nthe 400 people benefiting from skills training on water supply asset management, operations, \nand management. The PMC will help the MPUDC to prepare a town-wise action plan for \nimplementation. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  Social safeguards. The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement and \nfor indigenous peoples. Subprojects with significant involuntary resettlement and/or indigenous \npeoples  impacts  will  not  be  eligible  for  funding  under  the  project.  MPUDC  prepared  a \nresettlement framework and indigenous peoples planning framework following ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) and applicable laws. MPUDC prepared a draft resettlement plan and \ndue diligence reports on involuntary resettlement impacts and impacts on indigenous peoples in \n                                                \n24 Financial Management Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nline with the Safeguard Policy Statement, which will be updated after detailed designs. The \ninvoluntary  resettlement  impacts  are  mostly  temporary  during  the  construction.  Indigenous \npeoples or scheduled tribes will  benefit from project investments. The proposed mitigation \nmeasures,  including  capacity  building  of  the  PMU  and  project  implementation  units,  are \nadequate to address the assessed risks. MPUDC disclosed the safeguard documents on the \ngovernment\u2019s  website,  and  will  share  relevant  information  with  the  affected  persons.  A \ngrievance redress mechanism will be established by each participating ULB and disclosed to \nthe project\u2019s beneficiaries and/or affected communities before civil work contracts are awarded. \nThe implementing agency will prepare a semiannual social safeguard monitoring report for ADB \nreview and disclosure.27 \n \n28.  Environmental safeguards. The project is classified category B for the environment \nfollowing the Safeguard Policy Statement. MPUDC prepared an environmental assessment and \nreview framework in line with the Safeguard Policy Statement and applicable laws. Three initial \nenvironmental  examination  reports  prepared  for  sample  subprojects  in  Khajuraho,  Kothri, \nRajnagar, and Sagar show that the subprojects are not likely to cause any significant adverse \nenvironmental impacts and that any impacts during construction and operation can be mitigated \nthrough  appropriate  design  and  good  practices.  Public  consultations  were  conducted  by \nMPUDC  for  the selected  subprojects  during  preparation,  and  will  be  continued  throughout \nproject  implementation.  Environmental  grievances  will  be  handled  following  the  grievance \nredress  mechanism  developed  for  the  project.  The  implementing  agency  will  prepare  a \nsemiannual environmental monitoring report for ADB review and disclosure.28 \n \n29.  Disasters  and  climate  change.  Climate change projections indicate a temperature \nincrease of 2.6\u00ba C by 2050 in Madhya Pradesh.29 The key risk factors are droughts, extremely \nlow and erratic rainfall leading to frequent flooding, and seasonal depletion of surface water \nsources.  The  project  supports  the  efficient  use  of  surface  water  and  the  preservation  of \ngroundwater,  raising  awareness  of  climate  risks,  and  improvement  of  sewage  and  flood \ndrainage management to strengthen climate resilience. The project will incorporate appropriate \nmeasures for risks related to earthquakes, landslides, floods, and climate change.30 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.31 The project loan\u2019s fiduciary risk is medium, \nand the state government has adequate public financial management systems to mitigate such \nrisks. The integrated project benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of qualified contractors and  MPUDC and ULBs have conducted several pre-bid meetings to explain the bid \nchallenges in availability of  documents to the potential bidders.
