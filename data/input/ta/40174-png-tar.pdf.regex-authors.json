In Papua New Guinea (PNG), more than 90% of the population (mostly rural dwellers) \nhas no electricity. In urban centers, the power supply is often unreliable. The country\u2019s medium \nterm  development  strategy  (MTDS)  2005\u201320101  recognizes  energy  and  power  as  critical \ningredients for development and poverty reduction. The strategy invites the Government to \nassist the disadvantaged to \u201clift themselves out of poverty by improving basic services such as \nwater and electricity.\u201d  \n \n2.  Assistance to the country\u2019s power sector was included in ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and \nProgram (2006\u20132010)2 for PNG and confirmed during the 2006 Country Programming Mission. \nIn  February  2007,  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  fact-finding  mission  was  fielded3  An \nunderstanding was reached on the TA\u2019s purpose, key activities, consultants\u2019 terms of reference, \ncost estimates and financing, and implementation arrangements. The design and monitoring \nframework is provided in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \nA.  The Energy Sector \n3.  PNG  is  well-endowed  with  natural  resources,  including  energy  reserves,  but  the \ncountry\u2019s formidable geography and the high cost of developing infrastructure have constrained \ntheir exploitation. The outcome is a dual economy and society, marked by a few enclaves of \nindustrialization surrounded by widely diffused poverty. The high population growth (2.3% per \nannum) and urbanization rate have increased difficulties for the country.  \n \n4.  The challenge is for PNG to use its energy resources to help reverse a negative spiral \nand to move the country towards more sustainable social and economic development. This \nvision is articulated in the national energy policy, which aims \u201cto diligently promote and facilitate \nthe development of the energy sector in order to ensure the availability, reliability, affordability \nand  efficient  use  of  energy.\u201d  Therefore,  social  development  occurs  by  utilizing  energy  for \neconomic activity, through an environmentally sound manner.4  \n \n5.  PNG has substantial deposits of hydrocarbons. Oil production facilities at Kutubu, Gobe \nand Moran produce an average of 50,000 barrels a day. Most of the oil is exported through a \n273 kilometer pipeline and an offshore marine terminal. About 145 million cubic meters (m3) of \nnatural gas is produced annually at the Hides gas field for the Porgera mine\u2019s power plant. \nAlmost all the gas arising from oil production is re-injected into the oil-producing reservoirs, \nalthough a limited amount is flared for operational requirements. \n \n6.  PNG\u2019s  oil  reserves  are  relatively  modest  and  declining,  but  its  gas  reserves  are \nsubstantial. The remaining proved recoverable oil reserves are estimated at 80 million barrels. \nThe recoverable proved and probable natural gas reserves are estimated at 428 billion m3, \nequivalent to 3.02 billion barrels of oil. Limited and declining oil production potential makes it \nessential that PNG\u2019s natural gas fields be developed to maintain an inflow of foreign exchange. \n \n                                                 \n1  PNG. 2004.

Country Strategy and Program (2006-2010): Papua New Guinea. Manila. \n3   The TA first appeared as assistance to the Power Sector Study in ADB Business Opportunities on 15 March 2007. \n4   National Energy Policy and Rural Electrification Policy Workshop. Papua New Guinea, 21\u201426 August 2005. ", "2   \n7.  In order to supply gas demand in eastern Australia, a proposed $2.5 billion PNG Gas \nProject was designed to commercialize 5.6 billion m3 of natural gas. However, the cost of the \nproject  dramatically  increased  during  2006,  particularly  in  respect  of  the  gas  distribution \npipelines in Australia. This caused the entire scheme to be shelved in late January 2007. The \ncompanies involved in the PNG Gas Project have now turned their attention to the production of \nliquefied natural gas (LNG) for export to Asian and other markets. Such a project might yield \nannual revenues of about $200 million to $300 million5 for the PNG economy for 30 years. The \nproposed onshore gas pipeline to a coastal LNG facility would be managed to retain flexibility \nfor  third  parties  to  supply  different  areas  and  customers  in  accordance  with  government-\napproved access principles.  \n \nB.  The Power Sector \n8.  Natural gas could alleviate the problem of PNG\u2019s limited power supply, but it is not the \nonly solution. The country is rich in renewable energy resources suitable for power production, \nin particular hydropower potential. PNG has more than 15,000 MW hydropower potential. The \npossibility of building a $2 billion (60 meter high) dam to produce 1,800 MW of power at Wabo \non the Purari River to serve power aluminum smelting and to feed the power grid is being \ninvestigated. Coconut plantations are widely spread throughout PNG and may be a potential \nsource  of  power  as  coconut-based  bio-diesel  becomes  a  viable  option.  It  has  also  been \nsuggested that coal could be imported from Australia and Indonesia. There is no single solution. \nThe  geography  of  PNG  calls  for  articulated  power  sector  optimization  based  on  small \ndisaggregated markets.  \n \n9.  The  Independent  Consumer  and  Competition  Commission  (ICCC),  the  regulator,  is \nseeking to increase investments and competition in the power sector in order to increase the \nquantity and quality of the power supply. The aim is to reduce the environmental, economic and \nsocial costs associated with emissions, frequent power outages and limited access. However, \nthe ICCC does not have the capacity to conduct technical regulatory work. It has therefore \ndelegated  safety  and  standards  regulatory  functions  (on  a  yearly  renewable  basis)  to  the \ngovernment-owned PNG Power Ltd (PPL). \n \n10.  PPL  supplies  power  to  Port  Moresby  and  26  other  urban  centers  through  19 \nindependent  power  systems.  Its  present  generating  capacity  is  153  MW  (80  MW  in  Port \nMoresby) for total energy sales of 742 GWh (316 GWh in Port Moresby). PPL, formerly the \nElectricity Commission, used to be the sole generator, transmitter and distributor of electricity in \nthe country. In 1999, an independent power producer, Hanjung Power Ltd, negotiated the \nproduction  and  sale  of  power  to  the  grid  within  a  15-year  build-operate-transfer  (BOT) \narrangement. However, the present electricity tariff of about $0.15 per kilowatt hour (kWh) is \nhardly sufficient to cover the cost of the diesel oil needed to produce power in Port Moresby. In \nrural areas the cost of diesel alone can be three times the tariff, or more. Since 2003, PPL has \nbeen earmarked for privatization and a new private commercial operator, PNG Sustainable \nEnergy Ltd (SEL), is beginning to enter the sector.   \n \n11.   The  Energy  Division  of  the  Department  of  Petroleum  and  Energy  (ED-DPE)  is \nresponsible for the rural electrification program. The provincial governments have responsibility \nfor maintaining the Government\u2019s stand-alone rural generation facilities (C-Centers). There are \nseveral other power suppliers. Churches and missions provide electricity to nearby areas while \nsome mine, industrial and agricultural enclaves supply free electricity to nearby villages. PPL \n                                                 \n5 Equivalent up to 9% of PNG\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). ", "                                3\n                       \nhas an ongoing program of extending the urban grids to sell electricity to rural communities \nclose to the grid. SEL is also actively entering the sector. The World Bank is assisting SEL with \na Solar Lantern Project for teachers, and it is discussing possible assistance to finance mini-\nhydro schemes in rural areas. \n \nC.  The Power Sector Development Plan \n12.  Several studies have been produced on the conditions and challenges in PNG\u2019s power \nsector, including a study of energy sector and rural electrification assisted by the World Bank6 \nand PPL\u2019s National and Provincial Ten Year Power Development Plan.7 ED-DPE has drafted \nthe overall country energy and power policy framework.8 A national electricity industry policy \ntask force has been created to chart the country\u2019s electricity needs in accordance with the \nMTDS priorities. The Government has asked ED-DPE to complement its draft policy with a \nsector master plan. This is consistent with the Paris Declaration\u2019s9 partnership commitment to \ntranslate national development strategies into prioritized result-oriented operational programs.  \n \n13.  The development plan requires a comprehensive and consultation-based power sector \nanalysis combined with a stakeholders\u2019 diagnostic analysis to provide a more holistic view of the \nsector\u2019s challenges and opportunities. The plan will also provide a power sector operational \nprogram with recommended actions, timetables and costing.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The  long-term  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  increase  the  availability  of  a  reliable  and \nsustainable power supply at reasonable cost. The purpose is to assist the Government to \nexamine  issues  and  options  to  promote  and  facilitate  the  provision  of  reliable,  safe  and \naffordable access to an efficient electrical power supply for PNG. \n \n15.  The main outputs of the TA will include the following. \n \n(i)  Assessment of power sector demand and supply. Building upon the findings \nof previous studies of the sector and the knowledge of the ED-DPE, the TA will \nundertake research and detailed consultations to (a) provide an overview of \nsector demand and supply, (b) assist in identifying and addressing the main \ninformation gaps, (c) identify ways of maximizing renewable energy production \nand energy efficiency to reduce the overall cost of providing power, and (d) \ndiscuss  the  main  findings  with  the  Government  and  private  sector  and  civil \nsociety representatives. \n  \n(ii)  Review of power sector policy, legislation, regulations and procedures. \nNew technologies are emerging and private sector operators show interest not \nonly  in  supplying  the  more  viable  load  centers,  but  also  in  building  and/or \n                                                 \n6  World Bank. 2004.

The current policy and regulatory system \nneeds review, which should include consideration of the appropriate assignment \nof responsibility for technical regulation. The TA will also assist in drafting any \nrequired amendments to the law and regulations.  \n \n(iii)  Diagnostic  analysis  of  sector  entities  and  related  binding  constraints. \nSeveral entities are engaged in the sector. PPL supplies electricity to the main \ncenters. ED-DPE, local governments, churches, non-government organizations \n(NGOs) and private operators commonly serve rural areas. The TA will identify \nthe capacity of stakeholders, issues, binding constraints and lessons learned. It \nwill  discuss  recommendations  and  propose  concrete  steps  to  improve  and \naddress  sector  efficiency  and  efficacy,  environmental  and  social  issues, \nconsumer protection and sustainability.  \n \n(iv)  Power demand forecast and least-cost supply development plan. PNG\u2019s \nexpected power demand and potential supply is geographically diverse. The TA \nwill  assist  in  (a)  forecasting  power  demand,  (b)  identifying  the  least-cost \ndevelopment  program  that  facilitates  economic  development  and  poverty \nreduction, and (c) undertaking preliminary technical, economic, financial, social \nand  environmental  analysis  for  prioritized  investment  requirements  in  the \ndevelopment program. \n \n(v)  Action-oriented and monitorable power sector operational program. The \npower sector operational program will define the key and practical tasks that \nneed  to  be  done,  the  task  responsibilities  and  a  schedule.  The  operational \nprogram  will  be  action-oriented,  realistic  and practical.  It  will  also  advise  on \npotential roles for ADB, the private sector and civil society, and include all the \ninformation and tasks required to undertake coordination among donors.10  \n \n(vi)  Capacity building. During the TA implementation, the consultant will maximize \non-the-job  training  and  technology  transfer,  particularly  by  working  in  close \nconsultation and collaboration with ED-DPE counterpart staff. The outcome of \nsuch interaction will be assessed, and this approach will be emphasized to the \nconsultant at the outset.  \n \n(vii)  Results dissemination. The results and findings of the TA will be presented and \ndiscussed with the main stakeholders and widely published in an easy-to-read \nformat and in the local language(s), as required. The main recommendations \nmay become the basis for an information paper to the National Executive Council \n(the Cabinet) and subsequently a white paper for presentation to the Parliament. \nThe consultant\u2019s final report containing the main issues and concerns raised and \nsolutions identified will be widely circulated and posted on the internet. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n10  Several donors are involved in the sector, including ADB, the Australian Overseas Aid Program (AusAID), the PNG \nSustainable  Development  Program  (PNGSDP),  the  Pacific  Islands  Applied  Geoscience  Commission \n(SOPAC), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank. Donations are mainly for \npolicy assistance, rural electrification and capacity building.  ", "                                5\n                       \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.   The  TA  will  build  on  the  findings  and  achievements  generated  by  previous  sector \nstudies and assistance. The TA activities will include assisting the Government to (i) review \navailable literature and documentation; (ii) identify the present energy and power demand and \nforecast demand; (iii) assess the supply options and assist their optimization; (iv) review the \npertinent policy, legislation, regulations and procedures, and establish their appropriateness and \nany deficiencies; (v) perform a diagnosis of the sector entities and constraints; (vi) prepare three \nto five power sector development pre-feasibility studies for prioritized investments; (vii) draft a \npower sector operational program; (viii) facilitate the coordination of donors; (ix) enhance human \nresources capacity; (x) increase the awareness of stakeholders on the benefits of reform; (xi) \nfacilitate the support of policy makers; and (xii) disseminate the main findings and lessons \nlearned. \n \nC.       Cost and Financing \n17.   The TA is estimated to cost $630,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $500,000 equivalent \non a grant basis from ADB\u2019s Japan Special Fund, financed by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment of PNG will contribute $130,000 equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, communication, local transport and consultations and awareness facilitation. \nThe detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The ED-DPE will be the executing agency (EA) of the TA. The EA will facilitate the \ncollection of all available relevant information. The EA will recruit and appoint a project manager \nwith qualifications acceptable to ADB on terms of reference prepared by the EA and reviewed \nby ADB. The Director, ED-DPE, will provide overall guidance to the project. It is proposed that a \nsteering committee be chaired by the Department of National Planning and Rural Development \nand include representatives of ED-DPE, the Department of Provincial and Local Government \nAffairs, PPL, the PNG Gas Office, SEL, private sector representatives, NGOs and users. The \ncommittee will provide overall supervision and help to ensure adequate cooperation from local \ngovernment bodies, governments and NGOs active in the power sector, as well as users and \nbeneficiaries.  The  Consultative  Implementation  and  Monitoring  Council  (CMIC)  might  be \nconsidered for the role of secretariat to the steering committee.  \n \n19.  ADB will engage about 14 person-months of international and 10 person-months of \ndomestic consultant services. The services will be recruited through a consulting firm selected \nthrough the quality and cost-based selection (QCBS) method with quality cost ratio of 80:20 and \nbased on the submission of simplified technical proposals, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Procurement of equipment \nand software will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time) and will be handed over to the EA upon completion of the TA. The \ndetailed  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  given  in  Appendix  3.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented  over  20  months,  with  services  to  be  rendered  on  an  intermittent  basis.  It  is \nexpected to begin in October 2007 and be completed by June 2009.  \n \n ", "6   \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.
