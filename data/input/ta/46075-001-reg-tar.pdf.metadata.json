INTRODUCTION \n1.  Evaluations provide value addition in two ways: (i) accountability, through the use of \nevaluation findings to understand if resources were well spent and if the planned outcomes \nwere achieved; and (ii) learning, by communicating evaluation results and lessons to the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  of  ADB,  and  other \nstakeholders to improve development impact. Sharing knowledge solutions with the DMCs and \nthe region is one of the strategic objectives of the Independent Evaluation Department (IED). Its \nwork program is guided by the need to provide relevant knowledge on emerging development \nissues in the region and to proactively communicate this knowledge to inform development \npolicymaking in the DMCs.1 \n \n2.  To fulfill its mandate, role, and functions as guided by ADB\u2019s evaluation policy,2 IED has \ninitiated  significant  adjustments  to  its  work  program,  with  more  proactive  communication, \ndissemination, and outreach to make evaluation more relevant, responsive, and influential to \nADB and its DMCs. The proposed regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) will \nsupport the dissemination of IED evaluation products, encourage partnerships and networking \nactivities, and promote learning from development evaluation among stakeholders.3 As a pilot \ninitiative for organizing and managing evaluation outreach and sharing evaluation approaches \nand  results  to  DMCs,  the  initiative  will  contribute  to  discussions  and  policy  debates  on \ndevelopment issues that are important to the DMCs and key stakeholders. 4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  More effective knowledge management requires improvements at each major stage of \nthe knowledge cycle: needs identification, generation, sharing, and use.5 IED has made steady \nimprovements in the identification and generation of evaluation knowledge and has increased \ninitiatives to strengthen the last two stages. \n \n4.  IED recognizes sharing knowledge with decision makers can make its evaluations more \ninfluential  and  useful.  But  like  other  central  evaluation  units  of  multilateral  and  bilateral \ndevelopment  institutions,  IED  faces  challenges  with  evaluation  utilization. 6 These  include  \n(i) inadequate consultation with evaluation clients and poor understanding of their information \nneeds, (ii) inappropriate timing or findings that are not shared in a timely manner to potential \nusers, and (iii) information that is not presented in a format that makes it easy to use. Low \nutilization,  which  implies  wasted  effort,  highlights  the  importance  of  IED  efforts  to  ensure \neffective outreach and sharing to bring greater awareness and ultimately greater utilization of \nevaluation results. \n \n                                                 \n1 The Development Effectiveness Committee (DEC) of the ADB Board of Directors endorsed the 2012\u20132014 work \nprogram  on  29  September  2011:  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  approved  it  on  7  December  2011. \n(http://www.adb.org/site/evaluation/ied/work-program).  The  2013\u20132015  work  program  was  discussed  and  \nendorsed by the DEC on 1  and 10 October 2012, and approved by the Board of Directors on 7 December 2012. \n2  ADB. 2008.

To have an impact on decision-making, IED\u2019s evaluation findings must be perceived as \nrelevant, useful, and timely, and be presented clearly and concisely: \n  \n(i)  Relevant. Feedback and communication of evaluation results are integral parts \nof the evaluation cycle.7 Effective sharing can help increase understanding of \nevaluations, develop partnerships and support, and generate greater learning \nopportunities. This requires plans to get the right information and knowledge to \ndecision makers for application to improve development impact. \n(ii)  Useful. The money spent on evaluation is justified only if the evaluation results \nare provided to the right people, i.e., policymakers, managers, and stakeholders, \nto help them make the right choices, do the right things, and precipitate change \nfor better development outcomes and impacts. Evaluations that fail to meet these \ncriteria may not produce useful results, even if the methodology is sound. \n(iii)  Timely.  Sharing evaluation results at the right time provides opportunities to \nimprove development practice and organizational performance.  \n(iv)  Clear  and  concise  presentation.  Easy  accessibility  to  evaluation  results  is \ncrucial for usefulness. Knowledge sharing is needed in various formats that are \naccessible to users according their needs and time available. \n \n6.  In  addition  to  ensuring  quality,  relevance,  and  timeliness  of  evaluations,  IED  must \ncommunicate its results to multiple audiences inside and outside of development agencies. IED \nacknowledges that targeted evaluation outreach is as important as producing the report itself. \nWhen  evaluation  findings  and  recommendations  are  shared  proactively,  the  credibility  of \nevaluation is enhanced and incentives to act on it created. \n \n7.  While recognizing that new communication approaches are opening up new channels of \ninfluence, development agencies, including IED, have underscored the continuing value of \nmeetings, seminars, and briefings of various kinds (both within the organization and externally) \nas  indispensable  and  as  participatory  communication  channels  for  learning.  To  facilitate \nevaluation feedback, the use of face-to-face dialogue, presentations, and briefings are still \namong the more effective ways of sharing ideas. Interactive knowledge sharing and learning \nevents can help communicate messages or identify client needs, e.g., communicating specific \naspects  of  evaluation  studies  with  emphasis  on  interpretation,  knowledge  exchange,  and \npotential application. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be enhanced development policies and programs of selected DMCs. The \nexpected outcome will be increased readership and use of IED evaluation studies and findings \nby DMC stakeholders. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will primarily support interactive knowledge-sharing and learning events (i.e., \nconferences, seminars, workshops) that will inform stakeholders of formative, summative, and \n                                                 \n7  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.2001.

Knowledge-sharing  and  learning  events.  The  TA  will  support  knowledge-sharing \nevents on major evaluations (like flagship evaluations), and provide learning opportunities on \npriority  development  topics.  This  includes  evaluation  topics  such  as  microfinance,  natural \ndisasters,  millennium  development  goals,  social  protection,  inclusive  and  environmentally \nsustainable growth, climate change, and regional cooperation and integration. \n \n11.   At least two in-country knowledge-sharing events per year will be held in selected \nDMCs in partnership with national think tanks, evaluation societies, public and/or nonprofit \nresearch institutions, and other partners. These organizations will be asked to help organize and \ncoordinate the event in cooperation with IED. An in-country events management coordinator, in \ncoordination with IED, will manage and oversee the event. Policymakers, representatives of \npublic  and nonprofit  research institutions,  members  of  civil  society, individual  experts,  and \nopinion makers will be invited to attend. \n \n12.  Panel-based forums will bring together three to four panelists to discuss issues and \ntopics associated with the evaluation. The panelists will have substantial knowledge of the \nissues and good communication skills. A moderator will facilitate discussion among panelists, \nand between the panelists and audience. The media will be invited. The events will be audio- \nand/or videotaped as podcasts for wider dissemination through online platforms. IED will share \nthe details of the event and post-event materials through its website and social networking sites. \n \n13.  The TA will also support knowledge network partnerships with premier think tanks, \nresearch organizations, evaluation associations, and academic institutions in the DMCs. The \npartnerships with credible institutions are to increase learning from evaluations and to enable \npolicymakers and decision makers to interact meaningfully. For each learning event, IED will \nidentify a host or collaborating partner in the DMC. These institutions will work with IED in \nhosting and organizing the knowledge events. \n \n14.  During the first year of TA implementation, IED has tentatively identified learning events \non recently completed microfinance and natural disaster studies.10 These could involve events \nin Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. \n \n15.  Derivative  products.  From  every  learning  event,  IED  will  seek  to  develop \ncommunication  and  outreach  products  (such  as  podcasts,  multimedia,  and  synopsis),  to \npromote their reuse for further learning. For example, podcast and synopses are likely to be \nuseful for wider dissemination in the Pacific. \n                                                 \n8 These events intend to provide avenues for stakeholders at different levels, to communicate, collaborate, and give \nfeedback to evaluation approaches and results with a view to improving current and future development policies, \nstrategies, and programs in the DMCs. \n9  The draft concept note will be shared with the concerned regional department(s) (including resident mission[s]) and \nthe Office of Regional Economic Integration. \n10  IED. 2012.

Using evaluation results, IED will prepare and \npublish syntheses, briefs, and occasional papers tailored to increase readership and provide \ncontinuous feedback on ADB policies, strategies, and operations. The knowledge-sharing and \nlearning events will provide a venue for sharing and showcasing these evaluation products. In \naddition, IED will continue to use new mediums for knowledge sharing (e.g., on-line readers, \ntablets) to spread the reach of its products. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV). The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. IED will implement the TA and supervise \nthe  preparation,  organization,  and  hosting  of  the  knowledge-sharing  events.  Programmed \nlearning events and their associated outreach activities are to be carried out from 1 January \n2013 to 31 December 2015.  \n \n19.  The TA will require about 18 person-months of consultant services. Each learning event \nwill require the services of two national consultants (about 1 person-month each).  An in-country \nevents  management  coordinator  will  organize  and  coordinate  the  event,  assisted  by  a \nheadquarters-based  seminar  coordinator.  Resource  persons  will  be  engaged  to  serve  as \npanelists and moderator for each event. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \nDetailed terms of reference will be developed during the design and preparation of each event. \nADB  will  primarily  engage  consultants  on  an  individual  basis  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Specific service \nrequirements from consulting firms will be considered during the preparation and design of an \nevent.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Implementation \narrangements will be flexible enough to allow changes should IED\u2019s work program be altered. \nADB will obtain a no-objection from the DMC government prior to commencing any activity \nfinanced under this TA in the territory of the DMC concerned.  \n \n20.  With assistance from the in-country events management coordinator and headquarters-\nbased seminar coordinator, the host or collaborating partner in the DMCs will help organize and \nfacilitate the planned knowledge-sharing and learning events. Where appropriate, the partners \nconcerned  in  the  DMCs  (e.g.,  government  institutions,  premier  think  tanks,  research \norganizations,  evaluation  associations,  and  academic  institutions)  will  be  encouraged  to \ncontribute (in terms of services) for each event.  \n \nIV.  DECISION \n \n21.  The Director General, Independent Evaluation Department, acting under the authority \ndelegated by the Board, has approved the provision of technical assistance not exceeding the \nequivalent  of  $400,000  on  a  grant  basis  for  Supporting  Evaluation  Outreach,  Knowledge- \nSharing, and Partnership Initiatives in Selected Developing Member Countries.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be enhanced development policies and programs of selected DMCs. The \nexpected outcome will be increased readership and use of IED evaluation studies and findings \nby DMC stakeholders. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will primarily support interactive knowledge-sharing and learning events (i.e., \nconferences, seminars, workshops) that will inform stakeholders of formative, summative, and \n                                                \n7  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.2001.

Knowledge-sharing  and  learning  events.  The  TA  will  support  knowledge-sharing \nevents on major evaluations (like flagship evaluations), and provide learning opportunities on \npriority  development  topics.  This  includes  evaluation  topics  such  as  microfinance,  natural \ndisasters,  millennium  development  goals,  social  protection,  inclusive  and  environmentally \nsustainable growth, climate change, and regional cooperation and integration. \n \n11.   At least two in-country knowledge-sharing events per year will be held in selected \nDMCs in partnership with national think tanks, evaluation societies, public and/or nonprofit \nresearch institutions, and other partners. These organizations will be asked to help organize and \ncoordinate the event in cooperation with IED. An in-country events management coordinator, in \ncoordination with IED, will manage and oversee the event. Policymakers, representatives of \npublic  and  nonprofit research  institutions,  members  of civil  society,  individual  experts,  and \nopinion makers will be invited to attend. \n \n12.  Panel-based forums will bring together three to four panelists to discuss issues and \ntopics associated with the evaluation. The panelists will have substantial knowledge of the \nissues and good communication skills. A moderator will facilitate discussion among panelists, \nand between the panelists and audience. The media will be invited. The events will be audio- \nand/or videotaped as podcasts for wider dissemination through online platforms. IED will share \nthe details of the event and post-event materials through its website and social networking sites. \n \n13.  The TA will also support knowledge network partnerships with premier think tanks, \nresearch organizations, evaluation associations, and academic institutions in the DMCs. The \npartnerships with credible institutions are to increase learning from evaluations and to enable \npolicymakers and decision makers to interact meaningfully. For each learning event, IED will \nidentify a host or collaborating partner in the DMC. These institutions will work with IED in \nhosting and organizing the knowledge events. \n \n14.  During the first year of TA implementation, IED has tentatively identified learning events \non recently completed microfinance and natural disaster studies.10 These could involve events \nin Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. \n \n15.  Derivative  products.  From  every  learning  event,  IED  will  seek  to  develop \ncommunication  and  outreach  products  (such  as  podcasts,  multimedia,  and  synopsis),  to \npromote their reuse for further learning. For example, podcast and synopses are likely to be \nuseful for wider dissemination in the Pacific. \n                                                \n8 These events intend to provide avenues for stakeholders at different levels, to communicate, collaborate, and give \nfeedback to evaluation approaches and results with a view to improving current and future development policies, \nstrategies, and programs in the DMCs. \n9  The draft concept note will be shared with the concerned regional department(s) (including resident mission[s]) and \nthe Office of Regional Economic Integration. \n10  IED. 2012.

Using evaluation results, IED will prepare and \npublish syntheses, briefs, and occasional papers tailored to increase readership and provide \ncontinuous feedback on ADB policies, strategies, and operations. The knowledge-sharing and \nlearning events will provide a venue for sharing and showcasing these evaluation products. In \naddition, IED will continue to use new mediums for knowledge sharing (e.g., on-line readers, \ntablets) to spread the reach of its products. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV). The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. IED will implement the TA and supervise \nthe  preparation,  organization,  and  hosting  of  the  knowledge-sharing  events.  Programmed \nlearning events and their associated outreach activities are to be carried out from 1 January \n2013 to 31 December 2015.  \n \n19.  The TA will require about 18 person-months of consultant services. Each learning event \nwill require the services of two national consultants (about 1 person-month each).  An in-country \nevents  management  coordinator  will  organize  and  coordinate  the  event,  assisted  by  a \nheadquarters-based  seminar  coordinator.  Resource  persons  will  be  engaged  to  serve  as \npanelists and moderator for each event. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \nDetailed terms of reference will be developed during the design and preparation of each event. \nADB  will  primarily  engage  consultants  on  an  individual  basis  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Specific service \nrequirements from consulting firms will be considered during the preparation and design of an \nevent.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Implementation \narrangements will be flexible enough to allow changes should IED\u2019s work program be altered. \nADB will obtain a no-objection from the DMC government prior to commencing any activity \nfinanced under this TA in the territory of the DMC concerned.  \n \n20.  With assistance from the in-country events management coordinator and headquarters-\nbased seminar coordinator, the host or collaborating partner in the DMCs will help organize and \nfacilitate the planned knowledge-sharing and learning events. Where appropriate, the partners \nconcerned  in  the  DMCs  (e.g.,  government  institutions,  premier  think  tanks,  research \norganizations,  evaluation  associations,  and  academic  institutions)  will  be  encouraged  to \ncontribute (in terms of services) for each event.  \n \nIV.  DECISION \n \n21.  The Director General, Independent Evaluation Department, acting under the authority \ndelegated by the Board, has approved the provision of technical assistance not exceeding the \nequivalent  of  $400,000  on  a  grant  basis  for  Supporting  Evaluation  Outreach,  Knowledge- \nSharing, and Partnership Initiatives in Selected Developing Member Countries.
