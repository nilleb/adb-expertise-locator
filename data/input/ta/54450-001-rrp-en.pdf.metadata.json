The transaction involves the administration of an equity investment of up to the Indian \nrupee equivalent of $2,000,000 to be provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Ventures \nInvestment  Fund  1  in  Smart  Joules  Private  Limited  (SJPL)  in  India.1 Consistent  with  the \nestablishment arrangements for the fund, ADB will not invest its own capital alongside the fund.2   \n \n2.  SJPL is an India-based provider of data-driven energy efficiency solutions for commercial \nbuildings, targeting large hospitals as the beachhead market. SJPL delivers energy savings \nthrough a combination of (i) a proprietary Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensing and analytics \nplatform, and (ii) the application of an Energy Efficiency as a Service (EEaaS) business model. \nThe  investment  will  improve  energy  efficiency  in  commercial  buildings  by  reducing  carbon \nemissions and making the distribution system smarter. SJPL\u2019s vision to promote energy efficiency \nand eliminate energy poverty aligns with ADB\u2019s operational priorities to tackle climate change, \nbuilding climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability in Asia and \nthe Pacific. 3,  \n \n  THE INVESTMENT \n \n  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Indian energy sector. India is the world\u2019s third largest electricity consumer. Energy \ndemand grew by about 6% annually during 2010\u20132019, in line with growth in India\u2019s population \nand average income levels. India\u2019s energy-related carbon dioxide emissions comprised 6.4% of \nthe  global  share  in  2019.  Energy  demand  could  double  by  2040,  with  electricity  demand \npotentially  tripling  because  of  increased  appliance  ownership  and  cooling  needs.  Without \nsignificant improvements in energy efficiency, India will need to add massive amounts of power \ngeneration capacity, of which about 60% is coal-fired.4 \n \n4.  Energy efficiency industry overview. India\u2019s energy saving potential is estimated to be \n15%\u201330% across all demand segments, totaling about $10 billion per annum, with commercial \nand industrial buildings offering very high saving potential.5 Cooling services are particularly \nenergy-intensive in the commercial and industry building segment, with India\u2019s air-conditioning \nmarket expected to increase more than 30 times to 1 billion units by 2050.6 The energy efficiency \nindustry in India, however, faces various financial and technical barriers that deter investment. \nFinancial  barriers  include  the  weak  balance  sheet  of  traditional  energy  efficiency  service \nproviders,  the  small  size  and  high  transaction  costs  of  individual  projects,  and  high  risk \nperceptions of financial institutions because of limited familiarity and capacity to evaluate energy \nefficiency service providers. \n \n5.

Energy service company industry. Despite public sector interventions, including ADB \nprojects,  India\u2019s  energy  service  company  (ESCO)  industry  has  faced  market  development \nchallenges.11  ESCOs have typically struggled to scale up because of the lack of transparency in \nactual savings, lack of clear ownership rights between tenant and building owners to apportion \nthe resultant energy savings, uncertain payback periods, and the consequential inability to \ngenerate appropriate financial returns on investments made by the ESCOs. Technology (including \nthe use of IoT, sensors, and artificial intelligence data analytics) and innovative financing are, \nhowever, creating a new generation of EEaaS and equipment as service providers in emerging \nmarkets. These new technology-enabled business models are generating more significant energy \nsavings and faster payback periods.12  \n \nConfidential Information Deleted  \n \n  Ownership and Management  \n \nConfidential Information Deleted  \n \n  Financial Performance \n \nConfidential Information Deleted \n \n  THE ADB ASSISTANCE \n \n  The Assistance \n \n7.

The investment will be in the \nform of new equity (through a fresh issuance of shares), and ADB is expected to have an \nownership stake of about 10%. ADB will have the right to nominate a member or observer to \nSJPL\u2019s board of directors. ADB\u2019s investment will constitute about 50% of this financing round. \nADB expects to mobilize parallel equity financing of at least $8 million during 2021\u20132024.

ADB will monitor the investment, and investment reporting will \nbe subject to certain information disclosure requirements, in addition to compliance with Indian \nlegal and regulatory requirements. SJPL will provide ADB with financial reports at predetermined \nregular intervals and on request, including (i) a report on the use of the subscription proceeds, \n(ii) quarterly and annual financial statements for the past period, and (iii) annual budget and \nbusiness plans for the following financial year. \n \nConfidential Information Deleted \n \n9.

Support the development of Energy Efficiency as a Service. Asia and the Pacific is \nexpected to double its energy consumption by 2030, so the role of ADB in implementing energy \nprojects is more crucial than ever. The investment will support the evolving field of energy \nefficiency, which is critical in reducing India\u2019s carbon footprint and in addressing climate change. \nBy leveraging ADB\u2019s network, SJPL will be catalytic in establishing EEaaS as a business model. \nFurther, the fund\u2019s long investment horizon will allow SJPL to leapfrog into other emerging Asia \nmarkets\u2014limiting divestment concerns. \n \n11.  Resource mobilization. The investment is anticipated to have a significant signaling \neffect and is likely to increase the market\u2019s confidence in SJPL achieving its business goals. This \nwill help SJPL in critical areas, such as testing new products, and attracting future debt and equity.  \n \n12.  Progress to market-leading standards. As the first and only development finance \ninstitution shareholder, ADB will help develop and support SJPL\u2019s adherence to high corporate \ngovernance  and  integrity  standards,  as  well  as  its  adoption  of  market-leading  social  and \nenvironmental standards, with potential demonstration effects in the Indian energy sector. ADB \nwill also add value to SJPL by assisting it to (i) establish a more balanced board, including the \ncreation  of  a  financial  management  committee  and  an  audit  committee;  (ii)  implement  an \nenvironmental and social management system; and (iii) incorporate gender-inclusive workplace \npolicies. \n \n \n13  ADB. 2020.

This investment will help SJPL implement gender actions to promote \nwomen\u2019s economic empowerment by enhancing gender responsiveness in its workplace and its \nbusiness activities. It will also contribute to increasing women\u2019s skills and work opportunities in \nthe energy efficiency segment, and thus address the gender gap in the industry by increasing \nwomen\u2019s participation in its customer trainings and internship programs.

ADB \nexpects some of these investments to result in full or partial loss, consistent with the market dynamics of early-stage \ncompanies. ADB is therefore taking a portfolio approach, by investing in high-risk investments with potential to \ngenerate significant developmental outcomes. The outcome indicators of each investment are intended to be \nambitious, to be consistent with the portfolio strategy and fund-level outcome targets. \n17 ADB. 2019.

ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the investment. The business operations and SJPL\u2019s plan for the use of ADB proceeds \nwill not cause any significant adverse effects to the environment and will not trigger involuntary \nresettlement or indigenous people safeguards.  \n \n18.  SJPL has demonstrated compliance with the applicable national laws, regulations, and \nstandards covering environmental management, labor and social protection requirements. The \ninvestment is expected to increase economic opportunities by creating 250 new jobs, and SJPL \ncommits to adhere to applicable labor laws and internationally recognized core labor standards. \nSuch compliance will be reported to ADB annually. The Summary Poverty Reduction and Social \nStrategy is available in the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n \n19.  Gender equality. This investment is classified effective gender mainstreaming. SJPL\u2019s \ncorporate policies have several provisions that support women employees\u2014notably the \u201cStriving \nfor Greater Diversity in Team Smart Joules\u201d initiative, which directly promotes women\u2019s welfare \nand aims to increase the share of female employees from the 9% ratio in technical roles and in \noverall staffing. In its mission to build general skills on energy efficiency solutions, SJPL is looking \nto  further  promote  more  women\u2019s  participation.  Following  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment (1998), SJPL has incorporated measures to promote gender equality and women\u2019s \nempowerment in its business activities. Key gender actions relate to targeting the participation of \nclients\u2019 female staff in capacity building activities on the use of energy efficiency solutions, and \nenhancing gender equality at the company level through the implementation of a women-focused \nrecruitment strategy and an internship program focused on female students or graduates in \ntechnical fields. A gender target was also identified to raise awareness among Smart Joules\u2019 \nemployees on this issue, with the introduction of training for staff on sexual harassment in the \nworkplace. SJPL will submit periodic reports on implementation of gender measures to ADB. The \nGender Action Plan is available in the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n \n  Anticorruption Policy \n \n20.  SJPL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \n  Assurances \n \n21.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),20 \nADB will proceed with the assistance upon establishing that the Government of India has no \nobjection to the assistance to SJPL.
