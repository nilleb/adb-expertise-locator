The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak was declared a public health emergency \nof international concern by the World Health Organization on 30 January 2020, and thereafter \ndeclared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.1 The first cases were detected in December 2019 in \nWuhan, Hubei Province, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Since the beginning of March 2020, \nthe number of cases outside PRC has grown significantly. In Maldives, COVID-19 cases have \nspiked since 19 April 2020, with positive cases doubling every 4 days until 2 May 2020. Although \nthe doubling rate has since improved to about 10 days during 3\u201312 May 2020, the cases continue \nto increase, with 1,841 confirmed cases, 608 recoveries, and seven deaths as of 30 May 2020.2 \nTo effectively deal with the pandemic, the government established a COVID-19 Task Force for \noverall  pandemic  response  planning and monitoring, and a National  Emergency  Operations \nCentre to oversee the activities of stakeholder agencies. A COVID-19 Response Trust Fund \nCommittee was set up, with the finance minister as chair, for the oversight, and management of \nunemployment  benefits,  subsidies  on  electricity  and  water  bills  to  households,  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s economic response through subsidized working capital loans.  \n \n2.  The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly added to the challenges affecting economic \nand social outcomes in the country. The government applied social distancing measures, closed \nschools and other public places, and subsequently declared a public health emergency for a 30-\nday period across the country from 12 March 2020. The emergency has since been extended \nthrice with the current  directive  applicable  until  29 June  2020.  While  these restrictions  are \nnecessary from health perspective, Maldives faces the risk of economic downturn because of the \ndecline of the travel and tourism industry. The government projects a decline of 19 percentage \npoints in 2020 gross domestic product (GDP) growth to \u201311.5% from its pre-pandemic estimate \nof  7.5%.  A drop  in  tourism  activities  will  adversely  affect  government  finances.  The  total \ngovernment revenue in 2020 is estimated to drop by half of its pre-COVID-19 budget estimate to \n$990 million. Even after a 20% reduction in expenditure over 2020 budget estimates, the fiscal \ndeficit\u2013GDP ratio will rise to 13.7% in 2020 from 5.7% in 20193 and 6.2% (2020 budget estimate). \n \n3.  The government  introduced a countercyclical  expenditure  program of $351 million to \nmitigate the adverse health, social, and economic  impact of COVID-19, which consists of (i) \nCOVID-19 pandemic response plan targeting the upgrading and provision of health facilities and \nsupplies to support public health ($97 million); (ii) a COVID-19 social protection package for the \nvulnerable population such as the unemployed, poor, and vulnerable households, gender-based \nviolence survivors, and expatriate migrant workers; (iii) subsidies to households on electricity and \nwater bills ($124 million); and (iii) a COVID-19 economic response, providing subsidized working \ncapital to the self-employed and businesses ($130 million). \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s proposed COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support (CARES) Program, \nunder the Countercyclical  Support Facility COVID-19 pandemic response option (CPRO), will \nsupport the Government of Maldives in implementation monitoring of its COVID-19 response plan \n(para. 3). It will allow the government to undertake public expenditures that are essential for \nsupporting the vulnerable groups affected by COVID-19 and containing the spread of the disease. \n \n \n1  World Health Organization. 2020.

The  outcome  of the  TA  will be \ngovernment's  health  response  and  socioeconomic  package  delivered  to  the poor,  women, \nmigrant workers, elderly, and differently-abled, and other vulnerable groups, and businesses.
