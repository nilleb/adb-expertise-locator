INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will implement trade facilitation \ninitiatives to enhance customs administrations in the selected developing member countries \n(DMC) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Southeast Asia.1 It will help (i) implement \nselected provisions of the World Trade Organization Trade Facilitation Agreement (WTO TFA), \n(ii) strengthen engagement with the private sector, and (iii) advocate best practices and benefits \nof trade facilitation. The TA is aligned with operational priorities of the ADB Strategy 2030 on \naccelerating  progress  in  gender  equality  (OP2),  strengthening  governance  and  institutional \ncapacity (OP6), and fostering regional cooperation and integration (OP7)2. It is also linked to \nADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Priority 7 Fostering Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2019\u20132024, \nwhich  focuses  on  (i) greater  and  higher  quality  connectivity  between  economies,  and \n(ii) expanded global and regional trade and investment opportunity.3 The TA is included in the \nrespective country operations business plans for Cambodia,4 Indonesia,5 and the Philippines6 for \n2021\u20132023. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Trade facilitation as one of the key measures in Association of Southeast Asian \nNations integration. Trade facilitation plays a critical role in reducing trade cost by simplifying, \nmodernizing, and harmonizing trade procedures. A study shows that full implementation of the \nWTO TFA could reduce trade costs by an average of 14.3%, shorten the average time needed to \nimport goods by 47.0% and to export goods by 91.0%, and boost global trade by up to $1 trillion \nper year, with the biggest gains in the poorest countries.7 The Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) Economic Community Blueprint 2025 and its Strategic Action Plans on Trade \nFacilitation place priority on facilitating seamless movement of goods within ASEAN, which is also \none of the main chapters of the ASEAN free trade agreements with its main trading partners, \nincluding  the  Regional  Comprehensive  Economic  Partnership  (RCEP).8 The  ASEAN  trade \nfacilitation measures go beyond the provisions in the WTO TFA. Recent achievements in ASEAN \ninclude (i) the live operation of the ASEAN Single Window between all 10 ASEAN member states \nfor the Certificate of Origin (Form D) under the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement, and (ii) roll-out \nof ASEAN-wide self-certification. The ASEAN customs administrations are also committed to \ndeveloping a cooperation mechanism for mutual recognition of authorized economic operators.9 \n \n1  The selected DMCs are Cambodia and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, \nand the Philippines are participating as members of  the Brunei Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines \nEast ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) subregional group. All selected DMCs are members of the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN).  \n2  ADB. 2018. Manila.

Country Operations Business Plan: Philippines, 2021\u20132023. Manila. \n7  World Trade Organization. World Trade Report 2015.  \n8  The RCEP is a mega free trade agreement that ASEAN entered into in November 2020 with the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, India, and Australia\u2013New Zealand. The agreement covers a market of \n2.2 billion people, or almost 30% of the world's population, with a combined gross domestic product of $26.2 trillion, \nabout 30% of global GDP, and accounts for nearly 28% of global trade (based on 2019 figures). ASEAN has been \nimplementing an \u201cASEAN + 1\u201d free trade agreement with each of the RCEP participating countries in the partnership.  \n9  Certificate of Origin (Form D) is a prerequisite for importers within the ASEAN member states to claim preferential \nduty treatment under the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement. \n \n ", "2   \n3.  With the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, the ASEAN member states put in \nplace control measures in an effort to curtail the spread of COVID-19, such as movement \nrestrictions and border closures, leading to limited movement of goods across borders and \ndisrupted production of goods and services. Responding to this, ASEAN leaders adopted the \nHanoi Plan of Action which underlined the importance of ensuring the smooth flow of essential \ngoods at borders, while refraining from imposing unnecessary nontariff measures that are against \nWTO rules and disciplines.10  \n \n4.  Implementation gaps within and among Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nmember  states.  While  progress  has  been  made  in  ASEAN  trade  facilitation,  effective \nimplementation of the initiatives can only be achieved if all member states are at the same level \nof  operational capacity.  Within  ASEAN, there are  differing  levels  of capacity to  implement \ninternational and ASEAN standards and commitments. Subregional groupings within Southeast \nAsia, such as BIMP-EAGA, play an important role as they spur development in remote and less-\ndeveloped areas within the member states.11  Implementation of the WTO TFA has been \nchallenging, especially for some ASEAN member states such as Cambodia and Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR). A large number of category C provisions still exist, which require \nspecific implementation periods and capacity building support. For example, Cambodia has 6 \ncategory C provisions and the Lao PDR has 17 such provisions.12 Under the customs category of \nthe World Bank\u2019s Logistics Performance Index, Cambodia and the Lao PDR were ranked 109 and \n74, respectively, among 160 economies.13  \n \n5.  Strengthening  private  sector  engagement.  While  customs  administrations  are \nresponsible for the clearance of goods crossing borders, the private sector, including small and \nmedium-sized enterprises, plays an increasingly important role in trade facilitation services. The \ncommon message from private sector agents engaged in cross-border trade (such as importers, \nexporters,  freight  forwarders,  customs  brokers,  port  operators,  and  warehouse  operators, \ncollectively referred to as the trade-related private sector) is that customs formalities remain the \nmajor impediment to improved logistics and efficient supply chains. Another common complaint \nis the lack of business-friendly information about customs procedures, regulations, and standards. \nEngaging the private sector through dialogue to design and introduce any new and/or enhanced \ntrade facilitation measures is therefore important to ensure effective implementation of such \nmeasures. \n \n6.  Continued ADB support is critical. ADB has been supporting trade facilitation, mainly \nthrough TA in subregional cooperation programs within the Southeast Asian region, which has \n \n10 ASEAN. 2020. Hanoi Plan of Action on Strengthening ASEAN Economic Cooperation and Supply Chain Connectivity \nin Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.  \n11 BIMP-EAGA covers the entire sultanate of Brunei Darussalam; the Indonesian provinces of Kalimantan, Sulawesi, \nMaluku, and West Papua; the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak and the federal territory of Labuan; and the \nPhilippines island of Mindanao and province of Palawan. One of the strategic priorities for the trade and investment \nfacilitation sector under the BIMP\u2011EAGA Vision 2025 is facilitating cross-border trade to address the challenges of \ncumbersome rules, regulations, and procedures in the subregion, as well as streamlining such rules, regulations, \nand procedures. https://bimp-eaga.asia/sites/default/files/publications/bimp-eaga-vision-2025.pdf. \n12 WTO TFA category C provisions are provisions for which a developing country designates a specific date for \nimplementation, following a transition period during which the country is required to acquire implementation capacity. \nWorld Trade Organization. TFA Database (accessed on 23 September 2021). \n13 World Bank. 2018. Connecting to Compete 2018. Washington, DC. The World Bank\u2019s Logistics Performance Index \nprovides ranking based on an evaluation and calculation of efficiency of customs clearance processes. Other \ndeveloping ASEAN countries are ranked as follows: Brunei Darussalam 73, Indonesia 62, Malaysia 43, Philippines \n85, Thailand 36, and Viet Nam 41. \n \n ", "  3 \nhelped strengthen regional connectivity in ASEAN.14 Under the most recent TA, time release \nstudies were conducted in Cambodia and the Philippines.15 The reports from the studies included \na set of policy recommendations which were subsequently included in the national action plans \nof the countries as required. Support has also been provided for specific areas, such as for \nauthorized economic operators in the Philippines and an ongoing feasibility study on cargo \ntracking in Cambodia. A training workshop on authorized economic operators was also conducted \nfor BIMP-EAGA\u2019s customs officials. While progress has been made, much still needs to be done. \nContinued ADB support will be instrumental to advancing the momentum created from recently \ncompleted TA projects toward enhanced trade facilitation in Southeast Asia. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA will build on the support provided under the recently completed TA projects with \nCambodia  and  the  Lao  PDR  as  participating countries  and  BIMP-EAGA  as  a  subregional \ngrouping.16 The TA is aligned with the following impact: to achieve competitive, efficient, and \nseamless movement of goods within the Southeast Asia region.17 The outcome of the TA will be \nimproved trade facilitation measures in the participating ASEAN member states.  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  The  TA  will  have  the  following  three  outputs:  (i)  selected  WTO TFA  provisions \nimplemented, (ii) private sector engagement strengthened, and (iii) best practices and benefits of \ntrade facilitation advocated and disseminated.18  \n \n9.  Output  1:  Selected  World  Trade  Organization  Trade  Facilitation  Agreement \nprovisions implemented. The TA will assist customs administrations in Cambodia and Lao PDR \nselect and implement up to two prioritized provisions of the WTO TFA under the countries\u2019 \nrespective category C (footnote 12). A gap assessment between the status and the WTO TFA \nrequirements for the selected provisions will be completed. Based on this assessment, a work \nplan  will  be  developed  which  will  include  the  level  of  compliance,  targeted  timelines,  and \nnecessary actions to be taken to implement the WTO TFA requirements. The actions in the work \nplan will include: (i) technical advisory support, such as legal support and practical advice, to \neffectively implement the provisions and review laws and regulations to ensure compliance with \nthe selected WTO TFA provisions; and (ii) implementation support including the development of \nstandard operating procedures, complemented by capacity building for customs officials and other \n \n14  ADB.  2016.

The reports on \nTime Release Studies supported by the TA were submitted to the ASEAN Secretariat as inputs to their review on \nASEAN Seamless Trade Facilitation Indicators (ASTFI). The TA will continue the practice of sharing its outputs with \nASEAN, for consideration of their contribution to ASTFI. \n16 The Lao PDR indicated its interest to be a participating country of the TA during the fact-finding mission in May 2021. \n17 ASEAN Secretariat. 2015. ASEAN Economic Blueprint 2025. Jakarta.  \n18 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "4   \ngovernment agencies, to effectively implement the selected WTO TFA provisions. The TA will \nsupport the implementation of selected initiatives under the BIMP-EAGA customs cooperation \nwork plan to be implemented in accordance with the WTO TFA provisions. The TA will also \nprovide technical expertise and support in line with the related provisions of the World Customs \nOrganization Revised Kyoto Convention and SAFE Framework.19 \n \n10.  Output 2: Private sector engagement strengthened. Engagement with trade related \nprivate sector entities is quite critical, as they are directly affected by trade facilitation measures \nand could provide inputs on issues requiring further facilitation. It is also important to ensure they \nunderstand the trade facilitation measures to maximize the benefits of such measures. The TA \nwill help customs administrations in Cambodia and Lao PDR engage effectively with such entities \nthrough public consultations and dissemination of business-friendly information on issues such \nas new customs procedures and the provision of support services. Supporting information outside \nthe jurisdiction of customs administrations, such as availability of financing measures to support \nexport activities, will also be included where necessary. Such information will be disseminated \nthrough various means, including the websites of customs administrations, booklets in local \nlanguages, establishment of help desks on customs matters, and outreach sessions for dialogue.  \n \n11.  Output  3:  Best  practices  and  benefits  of  trade  facilitation  advocated  and \ndisseminated. The TA will support knowledge-sharing events for the participating countries  with \nother  ASEAN  Member  States,  to  share  experiences  and  lessons  with  public  and  private \n \nstakeholders,  including  industry,  business,  and  trade  associations.20 Various  topics  will  be \ndiscussed at the events, including best practices in the implementation of various WTO TFA \nprovisions, ASEAN trade facilitation initiatives, emerging issues such as the role of customs \nagencies in climate change, and opportunities for collaboration between subregional groupings \nthat are promoting convergence on trade facilitation initiatives among the ASEAN member states. \nThe knowledge-sharing events may be convened through remote video technology meetings, in \nlieu of face-to-face meetings, as necessary. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA. The Southeast Asia Department\u2019s Public Management, \nFinancial Sector and Trade Division will implement the TA in consultation with the department's \nresident missions and other sector divisions. Country coverage includes selected DMCs in \nSoutheast Asia (footnote1). ADB will engage the consultants and resource persons as necessary \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated staff \ninstructions. Indicative implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. Beyond the \nTA implementation period, progress of TA outcome will continue to be monitored under BIMP-\nEAGA  progress  reports,  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Cross  Border  Transport  Facilitation\u2019s \n \n19 In June 2005, the World Customs Organization Council adopted the SAFE Framework of Standards to Secure and \nFacilitate Global Trade that would secure revenue collections, promote trade facilitation worldwide, and act as a \ndeterrent to international terrorism. \n20 Given that the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) only provides support for international travel for officials in \nspecial circumstances, the knowledge-sharing sessions will be organized back-to-back within the participating \nsubregional groupings and regional forums. In cases where there are participation costs of officials, participants from \nhigh-income countries (e.g., Brunei Darussalam) will be expected to bear the cost of their participation in the session. \n \n ", "  5 \nCustoms Sub-committee report, as well as during regular dialogue between ADB and the ASEAN \nSecretariat.21 \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  November 2021\u2013October 2024 \nExecuting agency  ADB  \nImplementing agency  Public Management, Financial Sector and Trade Division; Southeast \nAsia Department, ADB \nConsultants  Selection Method  Selection Title  Amount \nIndividual consultant  Individual:   \nselection   3 international experts  $480,900 \n  (30 person-months)   \n   \n3 national experts   $129,300 \n(20 person-months) \n   \nDisbursement  Disbursement of TA resources will follow ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n14.
