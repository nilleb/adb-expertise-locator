I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  subprogram  2  of  the  Sindh  Growth  and  Rural \nRevitalization Program (the program or subprogram 2). \n \n2.  The program will support accelerated and sustainable economic growth in the province \nof Sindh in Pakistan (Sindh). This will be achieved by reforming public expenditure management \nand improving the business environment for the private sector to participate in infrastructure \ninvestments and service delivery. The program will stimulate economic activity, which will create \nemployment opportunities. Gender mainstreaming at policy and project design levels will ensure \nthat benefits accrue to both men and women in Sindh. The program will thus help reduce \npoverty, starting with rural Sindh.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sindh  has  about  a  quarter  of  Pakistan's  population,  generates  a  third  of  its  gross \ndomestic product. Sindh has a strategic location for trade, entrepreneurial capacity, and a \nvibrant financial sector.1  Sindh has a strategic location and is relatively better off, with a \nprovincial per capita income that is 37% higher than the national average.2 Yet growth and \nincome  distribution  have  been  uneven.  While 54%  from  services  (led  by  construction  and \nfinance) of the gross provincial product came from industry and 30% from industry, agriculture \ncontributed only 15% during 2002\u20132008. Half of Sindh\u2019s population lives and is employed in \nrural areas. However, budget allocations do not reflect this distribution; the government has \nunderinvested in rural infrastructure.  \n \n4.  Resources are limited in Sindh and are not used efficiently. The economic crisis has \nconstrained federal support, the security crisis has made investments uncertain, and structural \nweaknesses in public expenditure management limit the quality and geographic coverage of \nservices. Despite pressing needs-for transport, energy, water and sanitation infrastructure, and \naccessible, quality health and education services-16% of Sindh\u2019s annual development budget \nwas not used in FY2009 due to capacity and structural constraints.3 And without an enabling \nlegal framework and the requisite institutional structure, private sector's role in infrastructure \nprovision and service delivery has remained limited. \n \n5.  In 2008, Sindh developed a multi-sector reform agenda for the program jointly with the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)4 to  reduce  urban\u2013rural  disparities,  attract  private  sector \ninvestment, and create fiscal space through public financial management reforms. Subprogram \n1 supported the start-up phase of the reform agenda of the Government of Sindh (GoS), which \nis in line with ADB's country partnership strategy.5 The reforms under subprogram 1 included: (i) \ninitiation of policy work on public-private partnerships (PPPs) in Sindh; (ii) establishment of a \nPublic Enterprise Working Group to assess public enterprise performance, and to develop \nreform  options  for  these  enterprises;  (iii)  rationalization  of  development  budgets  in  line \n                                                 \n1  Summary Country Economic Indicators for Pakistan are provided as linked document 6. \n2  Advanced Economic Research Centre. 2010.

Manila (Loan 2484-PAK). \n5  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Pakistan, 2009-2013. Manila. ", "2 \ndepartments; (iv) establishment of a Public Accounts Committee in the Provincial Assembly and \nshort-listing of four departments for reducing audit backlogs; (v) establishment of an Employee \nBenefit Administration Task Force and adoption of an action plan to better manage employee \nbenefits; (vi) identification of rural development priorities and initiating work on  rural investment \nplan; and (vi) improvements in primary health care provision in rural areas through PPPs and \nrural empowerment initiatives. \n \n6.  The proposed subprogram 2 builds on and supports these reforms. GoS has taken \nmeasures to: (i) strengthen public financial management for efficient planning and utilization, to \nget maximum value for money; (ii) reform planning and budgeting processes and procedures; \n(iii) implement a rural revitalization and investment plan to improve growth prospects; (iv) create \ninstitutional and regulatory structures to attract private sector investments through public\u2013private \npartnerships,  thereby  generating  fiscal  space;  and  (v)  increase  investments  in  roads  and \ncommunications to connect and open up remote and rural areas to markets and investors, \nstimulating economic activity and contributing to poverty reduction. The resource requirements \nare significant, however, and Sindh faces fiscal constraints at present. The proceeds of the loan \nwill partly alleviate those constraints, while helping to leverage the proposed reforms. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  Subprogram 2 will promote broad-based growth across the province and spur growth in \nthe depressed rural economy. The program's long-term impact will be inclusive and balanced \neconomic growth. The main outcome of the program will be improved efficiency and delivery of \nselected services in Sindh, through greater private sector participation, institutionalized gender \nmainstreaming, and adequately provisioned employee benefit management. \n \n8.  To facilitate robust and inclusive growth, it is necessary to increase rural incomes and \ninvestments in Sindh. Poor seed quality and market distortions reduce the income of farmers, \nparticularly small-scale growers. Accordingly, Sindh Seed Corporation will be given greater \nautonomy through private sector management to improve the supply of certified seeds. Another \nkey challenge is access to finance. With accurate and readily available land titles, land can \nconstitute a marketable asset. Computerization of land records will help generate definitive \ntitles, which in turn will enable small as well as large farmers' access to commercial credit and \nrural support programs. By removing barriers to private sector investment in the agriculture \nproduce markets (APMs) and corporatizing public APMs, growers will be able to sell their \nproduce directly at the best possible price. Kotri, Larkana, and Nooriabad industrial estates \nunder  the  Sindh  Industrial  Trading  Estate  Limited  will  be  restructured  to  attract  private \ninvestment and help promote industrial activity. Moreover, GoS will partner with the private \nsector to provide infrastructure, generate employment, and supply better services. \n \n9.  The lack of adequate health and social welfare services imposes considerable costs that \nadversely impact economic wellbeing. PPPs\u2014which are currently in their infancy and focus \nlargely on physical infrastructure\u2014will be diversified to provide basic health services with the \npublic sector, enforcing minimum service delivery standards and monitoring results through \ncitizen  satisfaction  surveys.  Public  sector  employees  are  an  important  element  of  service \ndelivery, but face difficulties in obtaining their employee benefits, including pensions. Pension \nreforms  will  be  implemented  to  ensure  that  budgetary  provisions  are  adequate,  and \nadministrative reforms will be made to allow timely allocation and payment of benefits. Women \ngenerally have limited representation, opportunities, and access, and the program will help \ninstitutionalize  gender  mainstreaming  in  policy  formulation,  project  implementation,  and \nperformance monitoring.  \n ", "3 \nC.  Outputs \n10.  Subprogram 2 will support reforms in three core policy areas (CPAs). Reforms aimed at \npromoting gender equality cut across all these policy areas. \n \ni.  Core Policy Area 1: Private Sector Participation in Economic Activities \n \n11.  Enabling Environment for PPPs. The private sector can be a powerful ally of the \ngovernment in infrastructure development and service delivery. The government recognizes it \ncannot meet development financing needs alone. PPPs will allow the private sector\u2019s financial \nresources  and  technical  and  managerial  expertise  to  supplement  public  resources,  freeing \ngovernment resources for investment in priority non-infrastructure sectors such as education, \nhealth, and agriculture. Subprogram 2 will support the development of legal, regulatory, and \ninstitutional frameworks for PPPs.  \n \n12.  During subprogram 2 period, a PPP law was drafted and enacted. A PPP policy was \ndeveloped to provide operational guidance; it incorporates environmental and social safeguards, \nand gender provisions to ensure sound project design and inclusive implementation. The PPP \nand risk management units were formed, and their capacity will be developed systematically \nover the next two years. Guidelines for a project development facility (PDF) and a viability gap \nfund were developed to support PPPs. Current procurement rules were amended to include \nPPPs. \n \n13.  Commercialization  of  PSEs.  The  private  sector  will  become  a  more  prominent \nstakeholder in managing public sector enterprises (PSEs). Efficient and financially sustainable \nPSEs can generate revenues and reduce the fiscal burden on the government. To help unlock \nthe economic potential of PSEs and attract private investments, chief executive officers and \nmembers of boards of directors with proven experience in competitive market settings with be \nhired. Four PSEs from industry and agriculture sectors were chosen as pilot cases. Their \nArticles and Memorandum of Association are being revised to empower the respective boards \nof directors. GoS developed a restructuring policy for the three pilot industrial estates, based on \nthe lessons learned from these pilots. The Sindh Seed Corporation Act 1976 is being revised to \nprovide for private sector-led management in order to improve corporate efficiency and increase \nprovision of certified seed. \n \nii.  Core Policy Area 2: Public Expenditure Management  \n \n14.  Efficiency  of  Investments.  Planning  and  informed  budget  preparation  will  enable \nefficient management of public resources. In order to improve the quality of public investments \nand align public expenditure with policy objectives, the government will roll out the medium-term \nfiscal  framework  (MTFF)  to  all  government  fiscal  operations,  and  adopt  a  medium-term \nbudgetary  framework  (MTBF)  for  Departments  of  Education  and  Irrigation  and  Power  in \nFY2011. The MTBF will be extended to Departments of Agriculture and Livestock, and Fisheries \nduring FY2012. A rural investment plan is being developed to identify key requirements and \nmobilize resources for rural revitalization. Investments will be prioritized based on development \ntargets and resources. Twice tokenization of projects in annual development plans has been \ndiscontinued.  \n \n15.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Systematic  monitoring  of  results  will support  informed \npolicy decisions. Effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E) against performance standards and \npriorities improves the accountability of resource use and service delivery, and can inform \n ", "4 \npolicymaking  and  budget  preparation.  During  Subprogram  2  period,  business  process \nreengineering  of  the  government's  M&E  systems  continued  with  introduction  of  a \ncomprehensive  automated  monitoring  system  (i.e.,  the  Project  Monitoring  and  Evaluation \nSystem) and capacity building of M&E staff. The government will have third party evaluation of \nlarge  development  schemes,  and  publish  evaluation  reports  on  its  website  to  improve \ntransparency. To inform policy decisions, the Sindh Bureau of Statistics will be restructured to \ncapture and analyze gender-disaggregated data. \n \n16.  Audit  and  oversight.  Improved  internal  controls,  audit  compliance  and  legislative \noversight will improve management of scarce resources. Strengthened audit capacity will help in \nimproving compliance with financial and accounting provisions, thereby reducing waste and \nleakages. To improve internal controls for public financial management, in line with notified \nbudget ceilings, an MTBF for FY2011 will be adopted. New scheme approvals for the Annual \nDevelopment  Plan  (ADP)  will  precede  budget  deliberations  in  the  Assembly  starting  with \nFY2012. The Sindh Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) Act was enacted, and \nPPRA rules aimed at greater transparency in public procurement were developed and adopted \nduring subprogram 2. A project feasibility fund has been established to finance feasibility studies \nfor proposed projects to ensure high quality projects when the relevant line department lacks the \nrequisite  capacity.  The  Public  Accounts  Committee  (PAC)  will  provide  timely  legislative \noversight on public investments. Departmental Accounts Committees (DACs) will continue to \nreduce  audit  backlogs  and  improve  audit  compliance.  Business  processes  in  PAC  will  be \nstreamlined and a customized management information system (MIS) adopted, to: (i) improve \nits capacity, and (ii) ensure audit backlogs are systematically cleared by DACs. To decrease \nbudgetary losses, the government will strengthen its internal control strategy and improve public \nauction rules for moveable assets.  \n \n17.  Employee Benefits. Improved management of employee benefits will provide adequate \nincome security for civil servants, reduce contingent liability, and create much needed fiscal \nspace.  In  2002,  GoS  began  pre-financing  its  growing  pension  and  general  provident  fund \nliabilities.  With  ADB's  support,  GoS  has  undertaken  actuarial  valuations,  estimating  the \ncontingent liabilities of pensions and the general provident fund for FY2008 and FY2009, to \ninform policy decisions. FY2009 accrued liabilities were reported and cost of both schemes \ncalculated  in  line  with the  International  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standard  (IPSAS)  25.  In \naddition, Pay and Pension Commission reviewed reform options and a financing strategy has \nbeen prepared for the partial pre-funding of both pension and general provident fund benefit \npayments. GoS established the Sindh Fund Management House (SFMH), which will manage \nthese funds to improve transparency and accountability during the investment process.  \n \n18.  During subprogram 2 period, an SFMH investment unit was established. GoS adopted \nan SFMH strategy. An SFMH Bill is being prepared, based on the government's SFMH strategy. \nA reliable recordkeeping system is required to manage the employee benefits effectively and to \nprovide accurate, timely payments. The accountant general of Sindh has computerized its \nrecordkeeping system, and all available data were entered during subprogram 2 period. The \naccountant general of Sindh has launched one-window facilitation cells for swift processing of \npension  applications.  Employee  benefits  package  was  reviewed;  reform  options  for  an \naffordable and sustainable employee benefit system were identified for adoption.  \n \niii.  Core Policy Area 3: Rural Economy  \n \n19.  Investments in Rural Areas. A rural investment plan will identify means of bridging the \nrural\u2013urban economic divide. A sector development plan will be prepared to prioritize areas for \n ", "5 \nshort-,  medium-  and  long-term  interventions.  GoS  will  develop  an  MTBF  aimed  at  rural \nrevitalization with Departments of Irrigation and Power, Education, Agriculture, Livestock and \nFisheries.  \n \n20.  Entry to and Management of Agriculture Produce Markets. Free entry to markets will \nenable competition and long-term productivity gains, and ultimately contribute to growth. GoS is \namending the Agriculture Produce Market Act (1939) to remove the exclusive territory protection \nfor APMs established under the act. This will broaden the participant base, increase commercial \nactivity in APMs, and help raise rural incomes. More competitive APMs will become financially \nself-sustainable, thereby reducing the fiscal burden. The amended APM law will enable the \nprivate  sector  to  establish  and  manage  APMs,  and  incorporate  existing  public  APMs  as \ncompanies. Initially, all market administrators will be removed and more broad-based market \ncommittees  will  be  appointed.  Seven  of  the  largest  APM  committees  have  already  been \nconstituted. The committees will oversee the transition to company status. ADB will provide \ntechnical assistance to pilot-test the corporatization of three APMs.  \n \n21.  Land  Titles.  Proof  of  land  ownership  allows  farmers  access  to  credit  and  support \nprograms. Definitive land titles will provide legal certainty with respect to land ownership and \nconfer rights on farmers, enabling them to access commercial credit, which is a key constraint \nfor farmers in purchasing farm inputs and increasing agricultural outputs. To improve the quality \nand management of land records, the Board of Revenue will conserve paper land records, \ncomputerize  them,  create  a  geographic  information  system  for  land  management,  and \nrestructure its Survey and Settlement Department. Pilot testing of the geographic information \nsystem at taluka level and computerization of land records will start in July 2010 to support the \nmilestones identified in the rural investment  plan. The Land Revenue Act of 1967 will be \nreviewed for possible amendments. \n \n22.  Basic Heath Care Provision. Access to adequate primary health care contributes to \noverall productivity gains in rural areas. Poor health imposes considerable costs on those least \nable to purchase private health care, adversely affecting their employment opportunities and \nincomes. Since resources are limited, innovative solutions are required to finance and provide \nquality health care at the basic health unit (BHU) level. In 2005, the government partnered with \nthe People\u2019s Primary Health Care Initiative to manage the BHUs. During subprogram 2 period, \nthe initiative's management contract has expanded to include 18 of 23 Sindh districts. Service \ndelivery performance can be monitored using measurable and objectively verifiable standards. \nA GoS committee, led by the Health Department, updated and improved the existing minimum \nservice delivery standards. New standards will provide a benchmark for health service provision \nin Sindh. A third-party assessment will be conducted to take stop of beneficiary satisfaction with \nhealth services at BHU level. Beneficiary feedback and minimum service delivery standards \nbenchmarks will be used in developing a results-based health sector policy. \n \niv.  Crosscutting Reforms Aimed at Promoting Gender Equality \n \n23.  Women face challenges in accessing quality health services, employment opportunities, \nand  securing  entitlements.  During  subprogram  2  term,  to  integrate  gender  priorities  and \nresponsiveness into policy decisions and project implementation, the Planning Commission's \ndevelopment project pro forma for concept papers (PC-1) was modified. It now requires gender-\ndisaggregated data on the target beneficiaries and impact of every project in the ADP, with the \ngoal of moving from targeted programs for women to resource allocation that is inherently based \non gender needs.  \n \n ", "6 \n24.  Supported by the program, GoS also reconstituted the Provincial Development Working \nParty,6 which now includes the secretary of the WDD as a permanent member, thereby ensuring \ngender-related policy inputs are incorporated in investment decisions and ultimately the entire \npublic sector development portfolio. This will encourage equitable budgetary allocations. At the \noperational level, GoS adopted a new coordination mechanism (in its business processes) \namong  WDD  and  line  departments.  Sindh\u2019s  accountant  general  and  the  Sindh  Bureau  of \nStatistics will maintain gender disaggregated data to inform policy decisions. Moreover, the PPP \npolicy and PDF guidelines have been drafted. They include clear provisions for addressing any \nadverse project impacts (e.g., loss of livelihoods) on women, and ensure that positive impacts \nstemming from PPP projects (e.g., employment generation) accrue to women as well as men. In \naddition, the program\u2019s technical assistance resources supported the Board of Revenue in \ncomputerizing land records (with a gender filter), which will transform land into an undisputable \nand marketable asset. Women landowners, including haris, will be able to access credit and \nsupport programs using land as collateral, and earn their livelihoods.7   \n \n25.  Achievements under subprogram 2 will form the foundation of subprogram 3-supported \nreforms  during  July  2010\u2013December  2011.  Under  subprogram  3,  ADB  will  continue  its \npartnership with the government  to: (i) develop a PPP pipeline in the transport sector and \nstrengthen risk management capacity of GoS; (ii) restructure selected public sector enterprises; \n(iii) rationalize the ADP process; (iv) fully staff and operate SFMH; (v) strengthen the technical \ncapacity of agriculture, industries, and women development departments, the State Bureau of \nStatistics, and the M&E cell; and (vi) develop a results-based health sector plan. \n \nD.  Program Costs and Financing \n \n26.  GoS  has  initiated  a  number  of  programs  to  revive  rural  growth  in  Sindh  and  has \ncommitted to increase rural investments in line with MTFF during FY2009\u2013FY2012 period. It has \nalso allocated PRs20.7 billion within its ADP to targeted programs for rural development in \nFY2010  (Table  1)  and  plans  to  allocate  PRs22.5  billion  in  FY2011.  To  meet  its  pension \nliabilities,  the  government  has  allocated  PRs5  billion  in  FY2010.  GoS  faces  tough \nsocioeconomic challenges, and it is committed to addressing them with well-designed initiatives, \nsuch  as  the  provision  of  land,  technical,  and  financial  support  to  landless  haris,  thus \nincorporating marginalized segments of society into mainstream economic activities.  \n \n27.  To effectively support marginalized groups and sustain inclusive development,  GoS \nrequires about PRs29 billion ($342.9 million) in FY2011. In order to meet these overall program-\nrelated requirements of GoS\u2014which otherwise may not be met\u2014the Government of Pakistan \nhas requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR81,100,000 ($120 million) from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for subprogram 2.8 GoS will provide the remaining resources. \nThe loan will have a term of 24 years including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, and other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan and program agreements. The Government of Pakistan will relend the \nloan proceeds to the Sindh government. The terms and conditions will be the same as those \nextended by ADB to the federal government, including those relating to foreign exchange and \ninterest rate risks. \n \n \n                                                 \n6  The GoS authority that approves all development schemes (projects), from PRs 60 million to PRs5 billion. \n7  A detailed Gender Action Plan is provided as linked document 9 to this report. \n8  A Development Policy Letter from GoS, as endorsed by Government of Pakistan is provided in Appendix 3. \n ", "7 \nTable 1: Government of Sindh Expenditures in Areas Covered by the Program \n(PRs billion, unless otherwise specified) \n  FY2010  FY2011 \nRural investments a   20.7   22.5 \nLand titling     0.2     0.6 \nPension fund capitalization     5.0     6.0 \nFunds b     3.5     0.0 \nTotal    29.4   29.1 \nEquivalent in $ million   346.5  342.9 \na Includes GoS targeted programs for agriculture, livestock, fisheries, mineral development, and special   \npackages for rural development. \nb Comprises project development fund/facility (PRs300 million) and viability gap fund (PRs3 billion) for public-\nprivate  partnership  projects,  and  project  feasibility  fund  (PRs200  million)  for  provincial  development \nprograms. \nNote: Exchange rate used is $1 = PRs84.855, as of 26 May 2010.

Based on the current resource envelope, subprogram 3 is provisionally included in \nADB\u2019s budget framework as $120 million. The specific terms and size of the loan will be \nconfirmed during the processing of subprogram 3, on the basis of reform progress, requirement \nfor and availability of resources.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n29.  The Sindh Planning and Development Department, as the executing agency, will be \nresponsible  for  the  overall  implementation  of  subprogram  2,  including  coordinating  the \nimplementation  of  policy  actions  by  various  departments,  program  administration, \ndisbursements, and the maintenance of program records. The program management unit, set \nup under subprogram 1, will continue to coordinate day-to-day implementation requirements \nand arrangements. Finance Department will coordinate the activities of major implementing \nagencies  (i.e.,  the  Departments  of  Agriculture,  Livestock  and  Fisheries,  Health,  Industries, \nWorks and Services, Irrigation and Power, Board of Revenue). Subprogram 2 implementation \nperiod is from January 2009 to June 2010. Loan proceeds will be available for subprogram 2 for \nwithdrawal  in  a  single  tranche,  to  be  released  subject  to  conditions  specified  in  the  loan \nagreement. The proceeds of the program loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nsimplified disbursement procedures for program loans.9 The Governments of Pakistan and \nSindh will ensure that the local currency counterpart funds generated from loan proceeds for \nsubprogram 2 are used to support reforms in line with the program.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n30.  The constraints impeding economic growth in Sindh need to be addressed through \nvarious  instruments.  ADB  has  reviewed  economic  and  financial  performance  of  Sindh, \nespecially the provincial expenditure management and rural development options, and worked \n                                                 \n9   ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "8 \nclosely with key stakeholders and development partners10 in designing the program. Analytical \nunderpinnings  of  program  design  are  consistent  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund \nassessments for financial viability of the program.11 It will help alleviate policy, institutional, legal \nand regulatory bottlenecks. By so doing, the program will expand the fiscal space of the GoS, \nand attract private sector to commercially viable propositions previously handled by GoS. \n \n31.  In  parallel,  ADB  is  also  assisting  Sindh  to  improve  its  water  supply  and  sanitation \nsystems in secondary cities and peri-urban areas. ADB's large-scale transport and power sector \nprojects are channelled through the federal government. From an economic and financial due \ndiligence  point  of  view,  the  proposed  loan  will  leverage  reforms  and  provide  considerable \nbenefits to Sindh, as noted under the three core policy areas.  \n \nB.  Governance \n32.  The program includes regulatory and administrative reforms for fiscal transparency and \npublic financial management. Introduction of an encompassing MTFF and development of an \nMTBF will support improvements in planning and budget implementation. Efficient use of fiscal \nresources is crucial, and requires effective fiscal monitoring and control procedures, internal \ncontrol functions, and appropriate procurement procedures. Recent initiatives by the PAC and \nDACs have substantively reduced the outstanding external audit observations.12 The adoption \nof the Sindh PPRA Law and the fuller complement of (new and revised) rules will support \ntransparency,  consistency  and  accountability  in  procurement  practices.  In  addition,  a \nprocurement manual for PPPs will be developed. The program will support introduction of \nenterprise resource planning software for accounting and professional off-budget management \nof pension and other contingent liabilities. Service delivery will benefit from greater transparency \nresulting from MIS adoption, public private partnerships, and third party evaluations.  \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government of Pakistan and the GoS. And they agreed to the provisions of the \nprogram on efficient and effective use of loan proceeds, for the reforms in program areas. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n34.  Karachi, Sindh's capital city, has the highest per capita income in the country, while rural \ninhabitants are  among  the country\u2019s  poorest.  Sindh  has  the  highest  incidence  of  absolute \nlandlessness  (62%)  and  the  lowest  share  of  land  ownership  (26%)  in  Pakistan.13 Wealthy \nlandlords account for less than 1% of all farmers, but hold 60% of all farmland in Sindh. There \nhas been no perceptible improvement in children\u2019s health indicators during the last 15 years. \nMaternal and infant mortality rates remain higher than in other countries with comparable levels \nof development, and malnutrition rates are extremely high. Fertility rate in Sindh (4.1 children \nborn per woman) is higher than the national average (3.4), even though Sindh has the highest \nnumber of per capita health care professionals in the country. While access to public services \n                                                 \n10  A development coordination matrix is provided as linked document 5. \n11 A summary sector assessment and the IMF assessment letter are provided as linked documents 2 and 7, \nrespectively, to this report. \n12 Since December 2008 (subprogram1), audit backlogs for the four departments addressed under this program have \nbeen  systematically  reduced.  Reductions  of  61%  in  Agriculture  Department,  69%  in  Irrigation  and  Power \nDepartment, 58% in Livestock and Fisheries Department, and 89% in Works and Services Department have been \nachieved during subprogram 2 period. PAC and DACs will continue to address the remaining backlog. \n13 Government of Pakistan. 2003. Pakistan Agricultural Census 2000. Islamabad: Agricultural Census Organization. \n ", "9 \nimproved in Sindh,14 this has yet to translate into improved development outcomes.  \n \n35.  Under CPA 1 of the program, employment opportunities will be generated vis-\u00e0-vis PPP \nprojects. Under CPA 2, more efficient use and management of public resources will enable (i) \nimproved service provision by the public sector, and (ii) fiscal space for GoS to provide social \nservices. And under its rural revitalization component (CPA 3), the program supports initiatives \nthat aim to address some of these disparities. In the long run the computerization of land \nrecords will allow land titling to be regularized, which is necessary to access agricultural credit \nand support schemes, and improving livelihoods of the rural poor. Finally, the productivity of \npeople derives in part from their physical well-being. Under subprogram 2, the GoS developed \nnew minimum service delivery standards, incorporating maternal and child health care (in line \nwith Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5) as a benchmark; started assessing current gaps in \nservice delivery via third party evaluation of public and private service providers at basic health \ncare units. These will contribute to preparation of a health sector plan to close these gaps. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n36.  The  program  is  categorized  as  category  C  with  respect  to  potential  impacts  on \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples, and does not trigger any of \nADB's safeguard requirements under ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement.15  \n \n37.  Program design also includes safeguard measures beyond program completion. During \nsubprogram 2 period, a PPP unit was established, but it is not a project financier. The PPP Law \n2010, prepared under the program, requires that project preparation include a feasibility study, \ninitial environmental examination, and environmental impact assessment in line with industry \ninternational best practices. A PPP policy was drafted to ensure compliance with best practice \nstandards and procedures on environmental and social safeguards.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  Benefits from the program may be fully realized only if risks are addressed or mitigated. \nMitigation  measures  have  been  incorporated  into  the  subprogram  2  design.16 Overall,  the \nintegrated benefits and positive impact of the program are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n39.

ASSURANCES \n \n40.  The Government of Pakistan and GoS have assured ADB that implementation of the \nprogram  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies.  They  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain \ncovenants for the program, including those on policy actions and their continuation, policy \ndialogue, use of counterpart funds and program implementation, which are set forth in the loan \nagreement and program agreement. As part of program reforms, GoS has also agreed to the \nfollowing:  \n \n(i)  GoS shall prepare, by 31 October 2010, a capacity development plan, with an \nindicative budget for its implementation, for undertaking environmental and social \nreview and audits of PPP projects. \n(ii)  GoS shall adopt a restructuring policy for Kotri, Larkana, and Nooriabad industrial \nestates by 30 July 2010. \n(iii)  GoS shall refine it financing strategy for pension and general provident fund to \nprovide for long-term targets in line with actuarial estimates for FY2011 onwards, \nand approve it by 31 December 2010. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n41.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR81,100,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for subprogram 2 of \nthe Sindh Growth and Rural Revitalization Program from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with \nan interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and program \nagreements presented to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n2 June 2010 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance Targets and Indicators with  Data Sources and \nAssumptions and Risks \nSummary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nInclusive and      Sustained recovery of the \nbalanced  Average annual provincial GDP growth rate  Economic and statistical  Pakistan economy \neconomic  equal to at least national growth rate (i.e.  reports by federal and GoS   \ngrowth with  planned at 2% in FY2010)  entities  Inclusive and balanced \nreduced      growth of Sindh economy \npoverty and  Rural poverty incidence declining from 2007  World Bank, International   \nrural\u2013urban  to 2012, i.e. from beginning to completion of  Monetary Fund, and ADB  Continued commitment to \ninequality in  the program  financial and economic  reforms by provincial and \nSindh    publications  federal governments \n  Gender-responsiveness made a selection     \ncriteria for development projects in Sindh  Multiple indicator cluster  Risks \nfrom 2012  survey and Pakistan Social  Political instability hinders \nand Living Standards  investor confidence \nMeasurement Survey   \nreports  Poor security situation and \n  law and order adversely \naffects economic activity \n \nVested interest groups resist \nreforms \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved  Measurable progress made on 5 PPP  Economic and statistical  Political and macroeconomic \nefficiency and  projects (e.g., identification, pre-feasibility,  reports by federal and GoS  stability \ndelivery of  bidding, financial closure) in Sindh by  entities   \nselected  FY2011    Continued commitment to \nservices in    ADB, World Bank, and  reforms by GoS and \nSindh  Delays in ADP approval process halved in  International Monetary Fund  effective leadership in line \nFY2010  financial and economic  departments \n  publications   \nWider geographical coverage (at least 5    Risks \nadditional districts) and improved provision  GoS annual budgets and  Poor security situation  \nof basic health service delivery in FY2010  ADP performance reports    \ncompared with 2008 (subprogram 1)    Lack of transparency in \n  Third party evaluation of  administration and \nWDD empowered to: (i) coordinate all  primary health care  transactions \ngender cells in line departments;
