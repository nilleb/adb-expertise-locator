INTRODUCTION\n1. The Government of Sri Lanka has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to\nprovide technical assistance (TA)1 to prepare a rural finance project, aimed at reducing poverty,\nimproving  governance  of  rural  financial  institutions  (RFIs),  achieving  policy  reforms,  and\nenhancing economic growth in line with the Government\u2019s and ADB's country strategies. The\ncountry  programming  mission  that  visited  Sri  Lanka  in  March  2000  included  a  project\npreparatory  TA  for  the  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Project.    The  TA  Fact-Finding\nMission visited Sri Lanka from 3 to 16 March 2001, and had discussions with relevant ministries\nand departments, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), RFIs and other stakeholders including\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), farmers, and informal groups. This report reflects the\nfindings of the Mission and the understanding reached with the Government regarding the\nobjectives, scope, costs, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Sri Lanka has made substantial gains in reducing poverty, as reflected in its impressive\nhuman development indicator of 0.73, the highest by far in South Asia. Sri Lanka ranks with\nmore economically advanced countries like Malaysia and Thailand in terms of basic indicators\nof human well-being due to widespread access to basic social services. Poverty in Sri Lanka\ncan be attributed to a much larger extent to income and consumption than to access to basic\nservices. However, 4.5 million out of 17.5 million people in Sri Lanka were classified as poor in\nFY1996/97 in terms of a high poverty line.2 Poverty in Sri Lanka is also a predominantly rural\nphenomenon, with 87 percent of the total poor living in rural areas.3 Distinct regional variations\nin poverty exist at provincial and district levels, and also within districts. Poverty in the Northern\nand Eastern provinces is different, caused mostly by physical injury, psychological stress, and\nwar-related trauma. Deprived of basic services, economic activities hardly take place and close\nto two thirds of households are displaced.\n3. Agriculture accounts for roughly 40 percent of the workforce and 18 percent of the gross\ndomestic  product.  The  low  productivity  per  capita  in  the  agriculture  sector  explains  the\npersistence of rural poverty in the country. Slow growth in agriculture, combined with limited\nopportunities for diversifying economic activities in rural areas, constrains the scope for reducing\nrural poverty. The Government recognizes that creating an environment in which private rural\nenterprise can flourish and generate employment will stimulate economic growth and lead to\npoverty reduction.\n4. The financial sector consists of (i) CBSL; (ii) bank financial institutions: 9 domestic\ncommercial banks, 16 foreign banks, National Savings Bank, 5 development banks, and 6 rural\ndevelopment  banks  (RDBs);  and  (iii)  nonbank  institutions:  10  merchant  banks,  25  finance\ncompanies, 7 venture capital companies, 1,418 cooperative rural banks (CRBs), 14 district\ncooperative rural bank unions, and 8,424 primary thrift and credit cooperative societies (TCCS-\nSANASA). Bank financial institutions have 1,324 branches, providing a comprehensive network\nthroughout  the  country,  of  which  about  25  percent  are  RDB  and  National  Savings  Bank\n                  \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 1 April 2001.\n2 These poverty lines follow the central bank data giving an estimate of SLRs860 per person per month for\nFY1996/97 for the lower poverty line and SLRs1,032 per person per month and at the higher poverty line. In terms\nof the lower poverty line, about 3.3 million people (excluding the population in Northern and Eastern provinces)\nwere classified as poor. The estimated poverty lines are used in the framework of poverty reduction of the\nGovernment of Sri Lanka. The Department of Census and Statistics assesses poverty using a larger household\nincome and expenditure survey than the Central Bank and comes up with a different set of poverty lines\n(SLRs791 and SLRs950 ).\n3  A note of caution has to be added here, as what is now classified rural poverty might be reclassified as (peri)\nurban poverty after the next census.", "2\nbranches, and about 50 percent are branches of two state-owned commercial banks (Bank of\nCeylon and People\u2019s Bank).\n5. The rural financial system consists of (i) the formal system: rural branches of the state-\nowned and commercial banks, RDBs, CRBs, the Thrift and Credit Cooperative Society generally\nfocusing on landowners and other rich persons in the rural community and samurdhi4 banking\nsocieties focusing on those eligible to receive assistance under government income support\nschemes;  (ii)  the  semiformal  system:  farmer  banking  societies,  which  attempt  to  provide\nfinancial services to the farming community; and NGOs that specialize in providing of credit to\nlow-income  and  disadvantaged  persons  in  rural  communities;  and  (iii)  the  informal  sector:\nmoneylenders, produce merchants, and vendors. In the absence of a specialized financial\ninstitution for agriculture, CBSL plays the role of apex institution.\n6. There  are  many  RFIs,  in  fact,  a  proliferation  of  semiformal  institutions  needs\nrationalization. The absence of a legal and regulatory framework together with Government\ninterventions in establishing samurdhi banking societies and farmers\u2019 banking societies has led\nto proliferation, unplanned growth, and weak governance. The formal sector\u2019s share of credit is\nestimated at around 3 percent of gross domestic product, despite the fact that the rural sector is\nheavily banked and strenuous efforts to expand it, though not successful, have taken place over\nseveral decades. The proliferation of weak RFIs is a reflection of this inadequacy, and does not\nconstitute a sound approach to developing a market-oriented rural financial system. Measured\nin terms of viability, outreach, sustainability, and quality of services, the performance of RFIs in\nSri Lanka is less than satisfactory. Their outreach, defined in terms of providing access to credit\nparticularly for farmers and rural entrepreneurs, is limited. In terms of mobilizing deposits, the\nrecord of RFIs is somewhat better with a fairly large volume of deposits being raised in rural\nareas but with a substantial proportion getting drawn into urban areas. Many potential rural\nclients  are  not  able  to  access  appropriate  financial  services,  particularly  term  credit.  The\nproblem appears to be more acute especially in the case of borrowers requiring loans of\nSLRs1.0 million-SLRs5.0 million. The existence of loan schemes5 (SMI-IV, SMAP, SMILE, and\nSPRDP designed to offer subloans of less than SLRs1.0 million; and PFDP making subloans of\nSLRs7 million to SLRs18 million) does not seem to have addressed the needs of this category\n(or  this  category  of  borrowers  have  not  emerged  because  of  various  reasons,  such  as\ninappropriate  policies  or  environment).  Experience  shows  that  the  portfolios  under  these\nprograms tend to gravitate toward the larger end of the market, above SLRs5 million.\n7. Although access appears to be somewhat good for small borrowers from very poor\nhouseholds who borrow less than SLRs20,000 because of NGO/cooperative and Government\nintervention programs focused on this segment, the amount borrowed is insufficient to make a\ndent in their living standards. These programs are generally short-lived, not sustainable, and\ndependent on external support. Moreover, there are also very few insurance services and\nopportunities for risk management, and with a few exceptions, transaction costs are high for\naccessing these services. Service providers, on the other hand, suffer from serious viability\nproblems. Major issues confronting them are the high transaction costs; excessive competition\nin a market constrained by real sector limitations; excessive concentration on seasonal loans for\ncultivation exposing them to risks of crop losses; lack of skills for term lending; lack of equal\nopportunities largely on account of the operations of Government-sponsored programs; and lack\nof  credit  information,  proper  accounting  and  auditing,  and  supervisory  and  regulatory\nmechanisms providing for an enabling environment for market-based operations.\n                  \n4  Samurdhi means prosperity.\n5  SMI-IV = Fourth Small and Medium Industries, SMAP = Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project, SMILE\n=  Small  and  Micro  Enterprise  Leader  and  Entrepreneur  Promotion,  SPRDP  =  Southern  Province  Rural\nDevelopment Project, PFDP = Private Finance Development Project.", "3\n8. Under the ongoing financial sector reforms program, several measures that have been\nintroduced may further reduce the flow of credit to the rural sector. These  measures  aim at\nmaking  the operations of state banks more commercially oriented and releasing the CBSL from\nits developmental obligations. These include closure of loss-incurring branches of the state\nbanks mostly in rural areas, and a rollback of rural sector operations that are not commercially\nfeasible,  leaving  the  RDBs  and  CRBs  as  the  key  players  for  meeting  the  rural  sector\nrequirements. RDBs, although recently restructured, are already showing signs of weakening\nonce again with high nonperforming loans (NPLs). Without proper direction and control, CRBs\nare also showing signs of stagnation, particularly with regard to credit operations. Under the\nfinancial sector reforms program, serious consideration is also being given to proposals to\nreorganize the CBSL. The proposals include measures for CBSL to withdraw fully from its\ndevelopment  functions.  In  pursuance  of  this  objective,  it  has  already  dismantled  all  its\nrefinancing operation with own resources through which it influenced interest rates in this sector.\nCBSL\u2019s withdrawal and the rollback of state bank operations will deny the rural and agriculture\nsector financing of the policy guidance of CBSL, leaving RDBs and CRBs, institutions that are\nfinancially  and  organizationally  weak,  as  principal  players.  This  may  lead  to  the  pre-1980\nsituation when credit policy affecting agriculture, livestock, and fisheries was heavily influenced\nby the respective ministries and departments, and a reversal of the most significant policy\ncontribution made by ADB in 1979,6 which placed policy formulation within the purview of\nCBSL.7\n9. Financial services alone will not foster the development of rural businesses. In the  real\nsector, major issues requiring the attention of policy makers abound. Among these are subsidy\nfor water in areas under irrigation systems; enlarging the scope for private sector participation in\nextension and input supply; developing produce markets on modern lines; developing land\nmarkets;  constraints  on  rural  enterprise  development;  and  the  need  for  support  services\naddressing research and development and business and advisory services. The Government\nhas  to  address  these  issues  by  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  sustainable  private\ninitiative in development if RFIs are to become effective.\n10. ADB was first involved in rural finance in 1979, over two decades ago. This initiative was\nnot  followed  up  with  subsequent  efforts  although  several  projects  had  credit  components\nfocusing on the rural sector.8 The initial efforts at building a rural financial system were made\nwhen credit was construed as just another input in the production process with targeted lending,\nsubsidies on inputs, and cheap rates of interest as major features, and aimed at achieving high\ngrowth rates in agriculture. The ongoing financial sector reforms program has created the\nconditions for the gradual emergence of a more market-oriented rural financial system. Some of\nthe larger players are likely to leave; the role of CBSL as the apex institution is about to undergo\nchange; interest rates, with a few exceptions, are market determined; and policy makers appear\nto be more receptive to the institution of a market-driven rural financial system. The institutional\nframework for rural finance is moving into a period of adjustment. There is scope for influencing\nthe direction of policy reforms, including institutional development, establishment of a new apex\ninstitution, strengthening the regulatory mechanism, and addressing governance issues relating\n                  \n6 Loan 432-SRI(SF): Rural Credit, for $10.9 million, approved on 6 December 1979.\n7 The Government, recognizing the emerging situation, has announced plans to establish a National Enterprise\nBank. This proposal is an indication that, given the prevailing conditions in rural finance markets, policy makers do\nnot expect private sector initiative to enter this field even if fiscal and other incentives are offered. The proposed\nbank  will  be  established  with  resources  drawn  from  the  CBSL,  state  banks,  Employees  Provident  Fund,\nEmployees Trust Fund, and National Savings Bank. ADB has indicated to the Government that the justification for\ncreating the enterprise bank is weak and that ADB cannot, therefore, support it.\n8 (i) Loan 873-SRI(SF): Small and Medium Industries, for $15.0 million, approved on 21 February 1989; (ii) Loan\n899-SRI(SF): Perennial Crops Development, for $17.3 million, approved on 30 August 1988; (iii) Loan 955-\nSRI(SF): Smallholder Tea Development, for $25.0 million, approved on 21 February 1989; (iv) Loan 1084-\nSRI(SF): Second Small and Medium Industries, for $30.0 million, approved on 30 May 1991;and (v) Loan 1128-\nSRI(SF): Southern Province Rural Development, for $38.0 million, approved on 26 November 1991.", "4\nto a variety of RFIs at the village level. In addition, there is scope for strengthening support\nservices  in  marketing  agricultural  produce,  disseminating  technology,  providing  business\nadvisory services to promote rural enterprise development, and enlarging the participation of\nprivate  enterprise  in  activities  hitherto  handled  by  public  sector  agencies.  This  project\npreparatory TA will seek to exploit these opportunities by providing the inputs necessary to\nguide these efforts.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n11. The  TA  will  prepare  a  sector  development  program  (or  project)  suitable  for  ADB\nfinancing to support the Government\u2019s efforts to reduce poverty by promoting efficiency in the\nrural financial sector, essential for the growth of agricultural and rural businesses. The program\nwill aim at (i) promoting policy reforms conducive to building a market-oriented rural finance\nsystem; (ii) strengthening the institutional framework for better governance of the rural finance\nsystem; (iii) rationalizing Government initiatives and intervention in the sector; (iv) rationalizing the\nrole of the CBSL in regulating and supervising the sector; (v) encouraging private sector initiatives\nand investments in rural and agro-based businesses by supporting extension, marketing, and\nother services integral to the success of rural businesses; and (vi) enhancing the flow of credit to\nthe rural sector by strengthening the market orientation of activities (financial products) of RFIs\nand creating conditions conducive to its growth. \nB. Scope\n12. The  TA  will  undertake,  among  others,  (i)  a  comprehensive  study  of  the  sector,\ncomprising existing RFIs, the legal and regulatory framework, the financial and operational\npolicy framework, and changes taking place under ongoing financial sector reforms that may\nhave an impact on rural financial markets; (ii) demand and supply analysis for financial services;\n(iii) review of ongoing and past performance of rural finance sector projects of external aid\nagencies including ADB; (iv) review of the financial and operational performance of major RFIs\nand their capacity  to undertake term lending for rural enterprises and lending for income\ngenerating activities of the poor and the constraints to their effective performance; and (v)\nreview of existing institutional and other arrangements for poverty programs, assessing their\nadequacy and proposing  reforms. Based on the findings in (i) to (v), the TA will prepare a\nsector  program  and  investment  project  comprising  (i)  significant  rural  financial  sector\ninstitutional and policy reforms, (ii) a project component to strengthen RFIs and create the\nenabling environment for the growth of micro and small rural businesses, and (iii) a credit line\nfor small and micro rural businesses, suitable for ADB financing. The program will cover the\ncosts of adjustment inclusive of administrative and restructuring costs. The draft  terms of\nreference are in Appendix 1. The TA will identify advisory TA needs to further study unresolved\npolicy issues or to strengthen the capacity of key sector institutions. It will also assess the\nimpact of the proposed sector reforms on the poor and other vulnerable groups. Where adverse\nimpacts are envisaged, the proposed program should include mitigating measures, including\nspecific components or creating special funds for this purpose.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $703,000 equivalent comprising  $475,000 in\nforeign exchange and $228,000 in local currency equivalent. The Government has requested\nADB to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $75,000 equivalent of the local currency\ncost, or a total of $550,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from\nthe Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government agreed to meet\nthe balance of the local currency cost of $153,000 equivalent by providing counterpart services", "5\nincluding staff, logistic support, office accommodations, and office equipment and supplies. A\nbreakdown of the cost estimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n14. The Executing Agency for the TA will be CBSL, through its Rural Credit Department. A\nsteering  committee  will  be  formed  comprising  senior  representatives  of  CBSL,  Ministry  of\nAgriculture, Ministry of Industries, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Plan Implementation, External\nResources  Department,  Department  of  Cooperatives,  RDBs,  CRBs,  and  an  NGO\nrepresentative. The steering committee will review and guide TA implementation. In accordance\nwith ADB policies on participatory development, a series of stakeholder workshops will be\ncarried out during TA implementation. The Rural Credit Department will ensure that appropriate\nstakeholders attend.  Workshops for policy makers and other relevant groups of stakeholders\nwill be conducted at the start of the TA, at the time of the interim report, and at draft final report\nstage. In addition, workshops for civil society will be held outside Colombo to provide the\nstakeholders the opportunity to participate in designing the project. Aid coordination meetings\nwill also be held during TA implementation.\n15. As there are important policy and institutional issues that will impinge on the success of\na rural finance sector project, a policy group will be established comprising the deputy governor\nof  CBSL  as  chairman;  high-level  representatives  from  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Ministry  of\nAgriculture, Sarvodaya Economic Enterprises Development Services, RDBs, Bank of Ceylon,\nPeople\u2019s Bank, commissioner of Cooperative Development; representatives of NGOs operating\nmicrofinance; and experts in rural finance from research institutes and universities. The policy\ngroup will familiarize the consultant team with the Government\u2019s position on rural financial policy\nissues, and discuss what is appropriate and practical to be implemented under the project. The\nGovernment will consult ADB in determining the composition of this group.\n16. The Government has agreed to provide (i) one TA director and one full-time counterpart\nstaff in Colombo, and also ensure that one counterpart staff member will come from each RDB;\n(ii)  secretarial  staff;  (ii)  local  transport  for  consultants;  (iii)  office  space,  furniture,  office\nequipment, and local communication facilities for consultants in Colombo; and (iv) assistance in\nconducting all workshops. The TA will be implemented over six months, November 2001-May\n2002. About 12 person-months international and about 14 person-months domestic consulting\nservices will be needed. The international consultants will be experts in financial institutions and\npolicy, legal aspects of financial institutions, micro and small business, management information\nand information and communication technology systems, and economic and financial analyses.\nThe domestic consultants will have expertise in rural sociology, bank accounting and auditing,\nbank inspection and supervision, and laws relating to bank and nonbank financial institutions. A\nconsulting firm will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n17. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision  of  technical  assistance,  on  a  grant  basis,  to  the  Government  of  the  Democratic\nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $550,000 for the\npurpose of preparing the Rural Finance Sector Development Project, and hereby reports such\naction to the Board.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES\n1.
