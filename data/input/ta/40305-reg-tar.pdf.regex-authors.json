In January 2006 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) initiated a study to capture the \nglobal experience of community-driven development (CDD) approach and its application to ADB \noperations. The 3-month study concluded that CDD could potentially offer ADB an effective tool \nfor inclusive growth and an opportunity for a new business line. The study also highlighted the \nneed for ADB to proceed in CDD with care, given ADB\u2019s limited in-house experiences and \nresources. It recommended that ADB engage in pilot CDD projects as a special initiative over \nthe next few years and use the experiences for building capacity and knowledge in ADB and its \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs).  The  recommendation  was  widely  supported  during \ndepartmental briefings in ADB in October 2006.  This technical assistance (TA) is designed to \nimplement the key recommendations of the study and promote and support the demand for \nCDD in DMCs. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  CDD as a mechanism for poverty reduction and local development has emerged and \ngrown rapidly since the mid-1990s with the support of funding agencies, particularly the World \nBank. CDD gives community groups control over decision making and the use of block grant \nresources for local development, especially in infrastructure projects. Within the spectrum of a \ncommunity-based  development  (CBD)  approach,  which  is  a  generic  term  for  projects  and \nactivities that involve community-based organizations or groups, CDD\u2019s distinguishing feature is \ncommunity control of resources, backed by direct channeling of funds to community groups or \nmembers.  In  CDD  programs,  communities  are  active  participants  who  prioritize  their \ndevelopment needs and compete for resources by preparing proposals.    \n \n3.  CDD has been attracting attention because, when properly implemented, it is more \ndevelopmentally effective than other approaches. For example, independent evaluations of the \nKecamatan  Development  Program  in  Indonesia\u2500the  largest  ever  CDD  operation  in  the \nworld\u2500indicated an average economic internal rate of return of 52.7%,2 a much higher rate than \nthat in other similar but non-CDD rural infrastructure projects implemented in similar geographic \nareas of the country. CDD also offers the prospect of improved accountability. Transparency in \ndecision  making  and  procurement,  and  the  threat  of  audits  have  demonstrably  reduced \ncorruption and leakage. The bottom-up planning process of CDD presents more opportunities \nfor women and the poor to effectively participate in community and local governance processes.  \nEvidence also indicates that CDD is likely to offer better performance in cost recovery and the \noperation and maintenance of the selected infrastructure and services due to a strong  sense of \nownership of the community members. CDD can demonstrably operate to scale, as evidenced \nby the World Bank\u2019s annual CDD-related lending volume of about $1.5 billion.   \n \n4.  CDD is not just developmentally effective at the activity level. It also aligns well with \nsome of the higher level strategic directions of ADB. Properly designed, CDD has much to offer \nin terms of the overarching poverty reduction agenda and achieving both income and non-\nincome millennium development goals. It promotes inclusive patterns of growth and civil society \ndemand for good local governance, while offering opportunities for better results in some of \nADB\u2019s priority sectors such as rural and urban infrastructure, as defined in the Medium-Term \nStrategy II 2006\u20132008.  CDD could be an innovative solution to difficult contexts where formal \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 28 February 2007.  \n2  Guggenheim, S. Development from Below. Presentation made at a panel discussion on CDD: Can It Work for \nADB? Manila (6 October 2006).   \n ", "2   \nlocal  governance  and/or  local  markets  are  absent  or  dysfunctional  due  to  postconflict  or \npostdisaster situations, or to remoteness, exclusion, and other factors. It works well in programs \nor projects that focus on local-level infrastructure and service delivery such as roads, irrigation, \nand water supply and sanitation, local governance reforms, microenterprise development, and \ncommon property resources management. \n \n5.  However, CDD is not applicable to all development programs. There are also risks and \nlimitations with it. Success requires a significant level of capacity development assistance to \ncommunity members or groups, local governments, and other implementors, which may mean a \nlonger  preparation  period  when  first  implemented.  Close  supervision  is  required  during \nimplementation. Challenges typical to traditional development projects may still need to be \nmanaged  well,  such  as  problems  of  elite  capture,  limitations  in  inclusiveness,  technical \nsuitability of certain infrastructure choices, adverse spillover effects of certain infrastructure \ndecisions on neighboring communities, and long-term sustainability. In addition, CDD-induced \ngovernance and fund transfer structures should eventually be integrated into decentralized local \ngovernance and budgeting systems once community participation becomes a routine.  \n \n6.  Both  ADB\u2019s  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  evaluation  studies  on  CBD,  CDD,  and  other \nparticipatory approaches published during 2004\u201320053 highlighted most of the noted risks. \nDespite  these  challenges,  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Board  and  Committee  on  Development \nEffectiveness  recognized  the  significant  potential  of  CDD  for  poverty  reduction  and \nrecommended that the World Bank continue its effort to scale up CDD operations. In addition, \nthe projects evaluated were those of earlier generation CBD/CDD. The new generation of \nCBD/CDD projects incorporate lessons learned.  To avoid a parallel structure, for example, \nCDD  programs  are  increasingly  prepared  within  the  larger  local  governance  support  and \nbudgeting process. Project designs have been improved to better deal with excluded and/or \nvulnerable  social  groups  as  well  as  the  sustainability  of  community-based  organizations \nimproved under the CDD programs.  \n \n7.  In response to the growing popularity of CDD, ADB through its Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment  Department  (RSDD)  conducted  in  2006  a  comprehensive  review  of  its  own \nexperience with CDD, as well as its latest findings from other development partners. The key \nconclusion of A Review of Community-Driven Development and Its Application to the Asian \nDevelopment Bank4 was that CDD has long passed the novelty stage; there is enough evidence \nto show that scaled-up application of CDD in ADB operations can indeed promote inclusive \ngrowth.    \n \n8.  ADB has a reasonable level of experience applying CBD, CDD, and related participatory \napproaches to lending operations in rural and urban sectors, including large-scale projects \nfinanced by ordinary capital resources. Of 339 projects approved in 2001\u20132005, 28 (8% by \nnumber of projects) were labeled as projects with strong CDD elements, while 78 (23%) were \nlabeled  as  CBD  projects.  Among  28  projects  with  strong  CDD  elements,  44%  were  from \nSoutheast Asia, 40% from South Asia, and 16% from Central and West Asia region. However, \nthe application of CDD in ADB-supported projects has mainly been confined to relatively small \ncomponents within large loan projects. Its empowerment emphasis also has been limited; only \n                                                 \n3   World Bank. 2005.

Effectiveness  of \nParticipatory Approaches: Do the New Approaches Offer an Effective Solution to the Conventional Problems in \nRural Development Projects? Manila.  \n4   ADB. 2006. A Review of Community-Driven Development and Its Application to the Asian Development Bank. \nDraft. Manila.  \n ", "  3\n11 of 339 projects involved direct channeling of resources to communities, the major feature \nthat  distinguishes  CDD  from  CBD.  Only  nine  projects  had  a  participatory  monitoring  and \nevaluation component. A \u201cfull-scale\u201d CDD project that involves a majority of project funding \nchanneled to communities and strong capacity support to local and community governance \nbuilding is still rare.5 The review further pointed out the very limited application of CDD within the \npostconflict or postdisaster context. Limited staff capacity, the fear of implementation delays, \nand the lack of systematic institutional support were among the major reasons for such limitation. \nThe innovative nature of CDD will require a period of testing in the context of ADB\u2019s operational \nprocedures.  \n \n9.  In summary, the review proposes that ADB start with three major actions supported \nthrough a regional TA involving countries with CDD potential. First, a special initiative would be \nlaunched to prepare and implement a few CDD pilot projects among those in the pipeline for the \nnext 2 years. Such pilot projects could include: a \u201cfull-scale\u201d CDD project, a CDD project or \ncomponent in fragile states and/or a postconflict context, cofinancing or joint operation of a \nmultiagency  CDD  fund,  a  CDD  component  or  project  with  a  good  social  accountability \nmechanism, and with an effective social inclusion mechanism. The pilot initiative would be \npursued in collaboration between the operations departments and RSDD, and would allow ADB \nto experiment with innovative new approaches and catalog the findings through learning by \ndoing. The results would guide future application of the approach. This should also involve \nexploration of a possible new CDD-friendly operational modality and flexible and innovative \nlending instruments as part of ADB\u2019s ongoing Innovation and Efficiency Initiatives. \n \n10.  Second, the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and the Poverty Reduction Cooperation \nFund have been instrumental in spurring the use of participatory methods in ADB-supported \nprojects, including CDD components. It is essential that a repository for ADB\u2019s institutional \nknowledge concerning its CDD experience be built to accelerate ADB\u2019s learning. There are \nalready at least 30 ADB-financed loan projects with CDD components and a number of grant \nprojects financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and TA resources supporting CDD \nobjectives.  Tracking,  supporting,  documenting,  assessing  impacts,  and  disseminating  good \npractices among these are essential.   \n \n11.  Third,  there  is  still  a  large  and  unmet  need  by  much  of  the  population  in \nDMCs\u2500especially the poor, women, and other excluded groups\u2500for effective participation in \nlocal development that could be addressed through the application of CDD. However, this need \nhas not been translated into a strong demand for CDD, and so promoting such demand is \nimportant. Awareness raising and dissemination of CDD good practice could be effectively used \nfor this purpose, targeted at governments (central and local), nongovernment organizations and \nother civil society organizations, and private sector entities that are increasingly interested in \nCDD as part of their corporate social responsibility programs.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The intended medium-term impact of the TA is enhanced capacity and commitment of \nDMCs and ADB in scaling up CDD operations. The expected TA outcomes are the increased \ndemand for CDD by DMCs and ADB\u2019s enhanced institutional readiness for CDD. \n                                                 \n5   Indonesia could be the only exception where there is a relatively long history of a number of nationwide \ngovernment CDD programs.  \n ", "4   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The key expected outputs of the TA are (i) relevant and timely assistance provided to \nADB\u2019s CDD pilot initiatives in the DMCs concerned; (ii) knowledge generation and management \nfor ongoing CDD operations in ADB-supported projects; and (iii) enhanced awareness of and \ncapacity in applying CDD in participating DMCs on the part of governments, civil society, and \nthe private sector.  \n \n14.  Component 1: Pilot Initiatives.  Component 1 will provide technical support through \nCDD expert inputs to at least two ADB-assisted lending operations in preparing pilot CDD \nprojects,6 and explore innovative and efficient CDD operational modalities in collaboration with \nRSDD\u2019s Special Initiatives Group. The latter activity would involve assessing the need for \nprocedural improvements in ADB to reduce transaction costs for CDD or CDD-type lending \noperations, and exploring the feasibility of and demand for flexible financing instruments and/or \nmodalities  for  CDD,  including  possible  nonsovereign  lending.  The  pilot  projects  are  being \nselected in close consultation with ADB\u2019s operations departments and DMCs.7 \n \n15.  Component 2: Knowledge Management. The knowledge products envisaged under \nthis component will include, but will not be limited to, the following:  \n \n(i)  case studies that track and document ongoing CDD experience in and lessons \nlearned from loans, TAs, and grants;  \n(ii)  a  CDD  database  that  contains  a  project  tracking  information  system,  a \ndescription  of  key  available  resources  by  country,  a  list  of  experts  and \nconsultants, and other similar information;8  \n(iii)  a  regularly  updated  website  under  ADB\u2019s  soon-to-be  revamped  social \ndevelopment website; and \n(iv)  up  to  10  small-scale  studies  that  assess  specific  issues  related  to \noperationalizing CDD through ADB operations.9   \n \n16.  Component  3:  Awareness  and  Capacity  Development.  This  component  will \nencourage DMC demand for the CDD approach by raising awareness and knowledge of CDD \namong key stakeholders such as central and local governments, private sector operators, and \ncivil society organizations.  The component will also develop capacity among CDD practitioners \nin the field to become CDD ambassadors to other countries/stakeholders where potentials are \nhigh. Networking among the champions in DMCs also will be supported. Finally, at the end of \nthe TA period, the review recommendations will be revisited for any realignment in ADB\u2019s \nstrategic approach to CDD operations. This component will proactively seek collaboration with \nother development partners such as the World Bank to avoid resource overlaps and enhance \nharmonization, especially where a capacity development mechanism already exists.10  \n                                                 \n6   This will be complemented by staff or staff consultant assistance to operations departments in preparing one or \ntwo more additional pilot projects. \n7   Using the long list of loans in the pipeline for 2008\u20132009 approvals, RSDD and operations departments jointly \nworked on short-listing of pilot projects in early 2007.  \n8   Such a database should be built on existing systems in ADB such as C-cube. Maintenance of the database will \nbe continued by RSDD\u2019s Gender, Social Development, and Civil Society Division upon completion of the TA. \n9   Possible topics of assessments could be how to strengthen gender equality in CDD operations; enhancing \nimpact monitoring methodology; exploring private-public partnerships in CDD; or ex post cost-benefit analysis.  \n10   A good example of this is the CDD subgroup under the multiagency Decentralization Support Facility in \nIndonesia which provides a mechanism through which a range of research and capacity development activities \nare supported. ADB currently leads this group.  \n ", "  5\n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $400,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Details of the cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months starting in June 2007. ADB through its \nGender,  Social  Development,  and  Civil  Society  Division  (RSGS)  of  the  RSDD  will  be  the \nExecuting Agency for the regional TA and will be responsible for overall management and \nmonitoring of TA activities. RSGS will work closely with selected country teams and project \nteams in the operations departments, and in particular with the relevant resident missions. It will \nalso work closely with the Special Initiatives Group to explore opportunities for developing a new \nbusiness line and financing instruments. About 10 DMCs will be included in the TA.11 A no- \nobjection letter will be obtained before starting or financing  the TA activities in the territory of \nthe participating DMCs. The TA will be technically guided by an interdepartmental CDD working \ngroup  to  be  established  in  ADB.  The  group  will  be  expanded  gradually  to  include  DMC \nstakeholders during TA implementation.  Further, the TA will be implemented in partnerships \nwith the World Bank and other development partners.  \n \n19.  Eight person-months of international consulting services will be required. International \nconsultants will be recruited to (i) assist in preparing CDD pilot projects, and (ii) assess and \ndevelop operational and financing modalities for CDD. In addition, a national consultant (CDD \nand social development analyst) will be required for 22 person-months.  Recruitment of all \nconsultants will be carried out on an individual basis and in accordance with the Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of reference for the \nconsulting services are in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  The TA will be synchronized with the revamp of ADB\u2019s social development external \nwebsite by providing knowledge products and other materials. Given the significant work on \nknowledge management and capacity development on CDD carried out by other development \npartners, the TA will build on their success and add value by applying pertinent lessons to ADB-\nassisted operations. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis for \nSupporting  Community-Driven  Development  in  Developing  Member  Countries,  and  hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n11   These countries, spread across five ADB operational subregions, will be selected in consultation with operations \ndepartments on the basis of potential demand and the existing portfolio and pipeline. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \nEnhanced capacity and  CDD featured as an  National poverty reduction  \u2022 Existing CDD projects are \ncommitment of DMCs and  important modality in  strategies / development  properly designed and \nADB in scaling up CDD  DMCs\u2019 national  plans in DMCs and ADB\u2019s  implemented to demonstrate \noperations  development plans and  strategic documents  enough success to convince \n  ADB\u2019s strategic  DMCs and ADB of CDD\u2019s \ndocuments  effectiveness. \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nDMCs\u2019 demand for and  At least three new  ADB\u2019s country operations  \u2022 MTS III will emphasize \nADB\u2019s institutional  requests for CDD projects  business plans and Project  importance of reducing \nreadiness for CDD  from DMCs reflected in  Preparatory Information  inequality and promote \nenhanced  2009\u20132010 loans   System   inclusiveness through local \n  and community-level \ndevelopment. \n \nOutputs  By May 2009 (24 months)    Assumption \n      \u2022 There is sufficient demand for \n1.
