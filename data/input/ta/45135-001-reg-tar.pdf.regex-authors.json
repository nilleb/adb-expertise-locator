INTRODUCTION \n1.  In April 2005, the Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI) was established to \nsupport the work of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on regional cooperation and integration \n(RCI). In July 2006, ADB adopted an RCI strategy to support ADB's overarching goal of poverty \nreduction through regional collective actions.1 Consistent with this strategy, the OREI launched \nthe Asia Regional Integration Center (ARIC) website in October 2006 as a one-stop, web-based \nknowledge and information portal on the progress of RCI initiatives in the region.2 This marked \nthe first phase of an RCI-focused technical assistance (TA) project for ARIC. Further, in April \n2008,  ADB  adopted  Strategy  2020,  which  identified  regional  integration  as  one  of  three \ndevelopment agendas and RCI as one of its core specialization and operational areas.3  \n \n2.  This TA aims to assist ADB\u2019s RCI efforts by strengthening the ARIC website as a \nknowledge and information portal for RCI, thereby adding value to ADB's role as a knowledge \ninstitution. Building on the successes of previous TA projects, this TA will improve ARIC\u2019s RCI \ndatabases and develop an indicator system to track the progress of regional integration and its \neffects in the region\u2014contributing to economic growth and reducing economic uncertainty and \nfinancial volatility.4 It will also enhance ARIC\u2019s role of keeping a close watch on, and providing \nup-to-date analyses of the changing global economic and financial environment\u2014activities that \nhave become more important in the wake of increasing global uncertainty and financial volatility. \nThe design and monitoring framework for this TA is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Regional economic integration plays a vital role in improving productivity, accelerating \neconomic  growth,  and  reducing  poverty.  It  is  thus  a  welcome  development  that  regional \ncooperation  and  integration  has  gained  momentum  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  In  2010, \nintraregional trade comprised 59.3% of the region\u2019s trade flow, up from 54.9% in 2000. As of \nAugust 2011, 123 free trade agreements (FTAs) had been concluded, up from 45 in 2000. The \nregion\u2019s share of total foreign asset holdings also rose from 15% in 2001 to 27.9% in 2009. \n  \n4.  A need remains, however, to promote greater awareness and understanding of the \nbenefits of RCI. This can be achieved by providing reliable, timely, and accurate information on \nand analyses of various RCI initiatives in the region. Indeed, a prime opportunity for doing so is \npresented by the increased uncertainty and financial sector volatility that currently characterize \nthe world economy. The growing tension in the eurozone also highlights one weakness of \nregional integration\u2014contagion. These are key risk factors and important concerns for the \nregion,  which  need  to  be  tracked;  their  regional  implications  need  to  be  considered,  and \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2006.

Manila (TA 7396-REG). \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 September 2011. \n ", "2  \nmeasures to mitigate their effects need to be identified. ARIC is in a unique position to assist in \nthis function, having gained expertise in disseminating RCI knowledge and information widely, \nefficiently, and inexpensively. \n \n5.  Over  the  years,  TA  for  ARIC  has  contributed  to  the  increased  capacity  of  key \nstakeholders in the region to respond to various regional challenges. During the 1998/99 Asian \nfinancial crisis, the Asia Recovery Information Center provided reliable, timely, and accurate \ncrisis-related information, which was vital for restoring confidence and facilitating economic \nrecovery in the region. In March 2004, it was renamed the Asia Regional Information Center in \nrecognition  of  its  key  role  in  disseminating  useful  knowledge  and  information  on  regional \ninitiatives.  During  this  period,  the  Asia  Regional  Information  Center  continued  to  provide \ninformation on recovery efforts in Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines, \nand Thailand, which was later extended to cover the People\u2019s Republic of China, Singapore, \nand Viet Nam. In 2006, it was renamed the Asia Regional Integration Center and given a new \nmandate to serve as the knowledge and information portal on various RCI initiatives in the \nregion. Its website was restructured to focus on four pillars: cross-border infrastructure and \nsoftware, trade and investment, money and finance, and regional public goods.  \n \n6.  The  ARIC  website  has  established  itself  as  a  reliable  and  leading  source  of  RCI \nknowledge  and  information.  It  provides  up-to-date  information  on  (i)  news,  opinions,  and \neditorials on a daily basis, as well as RCI-related studies; (ii) useful databases such as trade \nintegration  and  FTAs;  investment,  macroeconomic,  monetary,  and  financial  indicators;  tax \nincentives; and climate change action plans and commitments, among others; (iii) calendars of \neconomic data releases and RCI events; and (iv) early warning system indicators. It supports \nthe publication of the Asia Economic Monitor (AEM), the RCI working papers, and other ADB \nflagship studies. ARIC also assists in the preparation of the economic prospects and policy \nissues  for  ASEAN+3  (confidential  notes),  which  are  ADB\u2019s  contribution  to  the  biannual \nASEAN+3 finance deputies\u2019 meetings.6 \n \n7.  ARIC\u2019s information architecture, database systems, and state-of-the-art technology have \nbeen  used  as  a  benchmark  by  the  ASEAN  Statistics  Unit.  ARIC  also  assisted  in  the \ndevelopment of websites for Aid for Trade, the Global Reserve System, and the ADB Finance \nCommunity of Practice. The Secretariat for the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa \nconsulted ARIC on its plan to establish a regional integration surveillance mechanism. In 2009, \nthe ARIC website was included by the Center for Comparative Regional Integration Studies at \nthe United Nations University in its best-practice analysis of online resources dealing with \nregional integration studies. The ARIC website\u2019s FTA section is currently linked to the Asia and \nthe Pacific trade and investment agreements database, which is maintained by the United \nNations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. The website attracts an \naverage of 7,650 unique visitors and 50,100 downloads per month.    \n \n8.  Following these achievements, this TA project will serve as the fourth phase of ARIC, \nwhich is timely given two important developments in the region.7  First, as a consequence of the \n                                                \n6  ASEAN+3 countries include the 10 members of Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus the People's Republic \nof China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. \n7  Overall assessments and ratings of previous ARIC-related TA projects were satisfactory. The Asia Economic \nMonitor, a publication under ARIC TA, has gained significant media coverage. For instance, (as of 29 July 2011), \nthe July 2011 issue was covered by some 50 articles in international media, and was featured by regional and \nnational newspapers. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Chinese Central Television (CCTV9) \ninterviewed the Head of the OREI, Iwan Azis about the AEM as well. As of 31 August 2011, the December 2010 \nissue has been downloaded about 605 times per month. The July 2010 issue also continues to generate interest \n ", "  3\nglobal financial crisis, growth needs to be rebalanced in favor of strengthening economic ties \nwithin Asia and the Pacific. This will not only give the region new growth drivers, but also make \nregional  economies  less  vulnerable  to  external  shocks.  Second,  due  to  heightened  global \nuncertainty  and  increasing financial  volatility,  regional  economic  cooperation  and  economic \nsurveillance have gained significance.  \n \n9.  ARIC phase IV aims to improve RCI monitoring by developing an RCI indicator system, \nwhich will track the progress of regional integration. The RCI indicator system will be developed \nin collaboration with ADB\u2019s RCI Community of Practice and in consultation with the rest of ADB. \nIt  aims  to  organize  and  combine  existing  regional  integration  indicators  so  as  to  gain  a \nmultidimensional perspective of RCI trends. The aggregation of indicators will provide a holistic \nview of the progress of RCI. In addition, the RCI indicator system will include the perceptions of \nkey stakeholders regarding the progress of and impediments to RCI in the region. It could also \ninclude other regional indicators from ADB\u2019s results-based framework.  \n \n10.  The results of the RCI indicator system will be reported in a new RCI publication\u2014the \nRCI Monitor\u2014which will discuss emerging trends and issues related to RCI. The RCI Monitor \nwill also be presented in a regional seminar on RCI. It will complement other ADB seminars on \nRCI, which aim to enhance staff capability in this area. \n \n11.  The TA for ARIC also aims to integrate the center\u2019s fragmented databases, so as to \norganize information for easy access by users. Not only will it feature the RCI indicator system \n(which  is  itself  a  way  of  organizing  and  summarizing  the  data  on  RCI),  it  will  strengthen \ninformation dissemination by developing country views within the website, improving the search \nengine, and conducting an annual survey of users to gather their views and suggestions on the \nARIC website. \n \n12.  The new TA will also strengthen the relationships between ARIC and ADB regional \ndepartments  and  offices  through  closer  collaboration  in  the  production  of  key  knowledge \nproducts (the RCI indicator system, RCI Monitor, and RCI Digest) and improved content sharing \nand linkage between subregional and ARIC websites. These new products will serve as tangible \ncontributions of the TA and raise the profile of ADB\u2019s RCI work in the region. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The expected impact of the TA will be the implementation of existing RCI activities, \ndevelopment of new ones, and assisting in economic monitoring and greater policy dialogues in \nthe region. The impact will be reflected in the number and scope of RCI initiatives, intraregional \nagreements, and other opportunities for cooperation (such as policy coordination). It will result in \ndeeper  understanding  among  key  stakeholders  of  important  economic  issues  and,  when \nwarranted, how RCI can help to maximize welfare gains or minimize losses in relation to those \nissues. The TA will also enhance the capabilities of stakeholders to track salient developments \nin global and regional economies. \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \nand has been downloaded about 331 times per month. So far, the July 2011 AEM has been downloaded about \n2,273 times. Since April 2006, ARIC has assisted in the development and publication of about 86 working papers, \nwhich are available online on the ARIC website. In 2010, working paper downloads averaged 2,717 per month. \n ", "4  \n14.  The expected outcome of the TA is that key stakeholders in the region will have greater \naccess  to  economic  analysis  and  RCI-related  knowledge.8 In  turn,  this  will  enhance  their \nparticipation in RCI and economic monitoring and analysis activities. This outcome will be \nevident  through  greater  participation  by  key  stakeholders  in  regional  economic  integration \nseminars as well as high-quality discussions on RCI initiatives and regional economic issues. It \nis expected that the TA will also contribute to greater dissemination of RCI knowledge through \nincreased website use\u2014which is expected to go up by 10%\u2014compared to the average use \nduring October 2006\u2013November 2011.9 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA aims to develop the capacity of key stakeholders to promote greater regional \nintegration by providing timely and relevant knowledge and information on RCI, facilitating \nregional  policy  dialogues  on  emerging  economic  issues,  and  supporting  research  and \npublication activities on RCI. In particular, the TA will have the following specific outputs: \n \n(i)  A  new  and  expanded  ARIC  website  and  updated  RCI  knowledge  and \ninformation in  the OREI  intranet. In particular, the quality of the website\u2019s \nnavigability, functionality, and dissemination capability will be improved. \n \n(ii)  Improvement  and  integration  of  various  RCI  databases,  including  the \ndevelopment of an indicator system for RCI, to track progress. \n \n(iii)  A  regional  seminar  to  present  the  RCI  indicator  system  and  the  RCI \nMonitor. Four other seminars to disseminate RCI knowledge will also be held. \n \n(iv)  Publication  of  three  issues  of  the  Asia  Economic  Monitor.  The \nmacroeconomic and financial database of the report will also be improved. \n \n(v)  Publication of an RCI Monitor (1 issue), ADB working paper series on RCI \n(9 issues),  RCI  Digest  (9  issues),  monthly  update  (18  issues),  database \nreports (4 reports) and country profiles (10 profiles).  \n \n(vi)  Increasing the profile of ADB\u2019s RCI work using new forms of mass media. \nARIC will also extend its network and expand its subscription list (or followers) \nthrough the use of new social media tools.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA will require an estimated $1,480,000 equivalent, to be financed on a grant basis \nby  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF\u2014other  sources).  The  detailed  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency of the TA. The OREI will implement the TA in close \ncollaboration with other ADB departments and offices. The RCI Community of Practice will \n                                                \n8  Key stakeholders comprise staff and officers from ADB, developing member countries, and regional or subregional \ninstitutions that work in the area of regional cooperation and integration. \n9  Estimated annual average web statistics are: 6,600,000 hits, 1,900,000 page views, 81,000 unique visitors, and \n378,000 downloads. \n ", "  5\nprovide advice and guidance. The TA will be implemented over 2 years, during December \n2011\u2013November 2013.  \n \n18.  It is estimated that the TA will require 9 international consultants with 51 person-months \nof consulting services, 15 national consultants with 256 person-months of consulting services, \nand 8 resource people with 1 person-month of participation. Individual consultants and resource \npeople will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, \nas amended from time to time). The scope of work and outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. A team of OREI staff (1 international staff, 1 national officer, and \n1 operations assistant) will oversee the implementation of the TA. \n \n19.  One  international  consultant  will  act  as  the  lead  economist  to  supervise  ARIC\u2019s \noperations. The other international consultants will include international economists, who will \nprepare special studies on RCI and assist in OREI seminars, and an economics and copyeditor, \nwho will edit ARIC and OREI publications. National consultants will include one assistant lead \neconomist, who will assist in the supervision of ARIC\u2019s operations, and around eight economic \nanalysts, who will maintain and update the content of the ARIC website, and assist in the \npreparation of OREI publications and seminars. Other national consultants include a website \nadministrator,  multimedia  designer  and  developer,  system  and  database  developers,  a \ntypesetter, and a project specialist to provide administrative support.  \n \n20.
