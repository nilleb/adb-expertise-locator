Through  ongoing  technical  assistance  projects  (TAs),  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) has assisted the government in defining key priorities for reforming and strengthening \nsecondary  education  subsector  (SES)  and  technical  and  vocational  education and  training \n(TVET), including identifying core priorities for investments that are expected to be included in \nthe National Education Sector Plan.  Additional project preparatory TA is needed to support \ndetailed formulation for a Program suitable for ADB financing in terms of technical, financial, \neconomic,  institutional,  sector  policy,  and  safeguard  dimensions,  and  to  provide  capacity \ndevelopment  and  other  support  to  ensure  a  rapid  start-up  to  Program  implementation.  \nConsultants fielded under this TA will work closely with ADB staff as well as consultants already \nmobilized under ongoing TAs.  \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The TA will (i) review the situation and gap analysis of SES and TVET supported by \nADB  as  part  of  the  Comprehensive  Education  Sector  Review  and  other  ongoing  TA,  and \nconduct more detailed assessment of institutional capacity dimensions relevant to the Program; \n(ii)  support  finalization  of  the  scope  of  proposed  project  investments,  with  a  focus  on \ndevelopment of capacity development programs as well as planning for procurements of civil \nworks, equipment, and materials required during the Program\u2019s early stages; (iii) conduct due \ndiligence including analysis of governance and procurement capacity dimensions as well as \nconflict sensitivity, and provide related support; (iv) prepare gender and ethnic group action \nplans and a communication plan to support reforms; (v) determine detailed implementation \narrangements and prepare the project administration manual to guide overall implementation of \nthe proposed Program; and (vi) after Program approval, provide capacity building and hands-on \nsupport to ensure rapid Program start-up. The TA will also provide inputs to work led by the \nADB processing team and existing consultants, including supporting (i) review and refinement of \npriority policy reforms indicatively identified for support under the policy loan, and finalize the \npolicy matrix laying out specific policy actions required for tranche disbursement; (ii) additional \nstakeholder consultations; (iii) preparation of the detailed cost estimates and the financing plan; \nand (iv) analysis of the Program\u2019s economic rationale and financial viability and sustainability. \n \n1.

Sustained  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  to  Myanmar\u2019s  Comprehensive \nEducation Sector Review (CESR) since 2012\u2014including through 2 ongoing technical assistance \nprojects  (TAs)\u2014has  helped  to  identify  key  challenges  and  priorities  for  the  post-primary \neducation subsectors, in particular the secondary education subsector (SES) and technical and \nvocational education and training (TVET).18 These TAs are also currently supporting reforms of \nthe SES curriculum, which is expected to be introduced into schools nationwide during the \nperiod  SY2017/18  -  SY2020/21  with  support  under  the  proposed  Preparing  Youth  for  the \nWorkplace Program (PYWP). A third TA is helping to pilot test new TVET modalities\u2014including \ncompetency-based modular short courses (CBMSCs)\u2014which are expected to be replicated and \nexpanded to other skill areas under the proposed Program.19 These 3 ongoing TAs are now \nsupporting the government\u2019s formulation of the National Education Sector Plan (NESP), which \nwill provide an overarching umbrella for the PYWP as well as other key programs that will \noperationalize the government\u2019s reform agenda for the education sector (including TVET). \n \n2.  Cooperation to date has yielded initial consensus on the broad scope of the proposed \nProgram. An indicative outline of core thrusts under each of the Program\u2019s 3 outputs is provided \nbelow, subject to concerted design dialogue with the Ministry of Education (MOE), Ministry of \nScience and Technology (MOST), and other agencies as well as potential cofinancing partners. \n \nOutput 1: policy frameworks and capacities for cohesive, workforce-responsive SES and \nTVET enhanced \n \n3.  Output  1  would  combine  cross-cutting  policy  reform  support  and  investments  to \nrationalize and better link SES and TVET, and build institutional and subsector management \ncapacity of MOE, MOST, and related agencies.  Subject to forthcoming joint design dialogue, \nkey  policy-related  areas  to  be  supported  collectively  by  PYWP\u2019s  program  and  project \ncomponents are expected to include (i) rationalizing SES and TVET, while supporting a phased \nshift to more decentralized structures;20 (ii) strengthening mechanisms and capacities to engage \nwith  employers  and  communities  in  SES  and  TVET  processes  ranging  from  ranging  from \ncurriculum and program development to delivery;21 (iii) developing and institutionalizing clearer \nlearning pathways linking SES, TVET, and higher education; (iv) quality assurance systems and \nrelated institutional capacities; and (v) policies and strategies for use of appropriate information \nand communication technology (ICT) emphasizing efficacy in serving core education sector \nobjectives, sustainability, and equity.  In addition to consultant inputs, capacity development, \nand other support in these policy-related areas, PYWP\u2019s project component is expected to \nsupport other cross-cutting areas, potentially including (i) capacity development support to MOE \nand MOST to jointly identify key competencies that need to be produced by SES and TVET; (ii) \nsupport for school network mapping, with a likely focus on SES and TVET institutions to support \n                                                 \n18 These TAs are: (i) ADB. 2012.

Technical Assistance to the Republic of the \nUnion of Myanmar for Support for Post-Primary Education Development. Manila (TA 8385-MYA).   \n19 ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for Support for Skills Development for \nInclusive Growth. Manila (TA 8634-MYA). \n20 It will be critical that Myanmar\u2019s approach to decentralization and provision of autonomy to TVET institutions give \ncareful consideration to capacity constraints and invest in building prerequisite capacities. \n21 This may potentially include support related to policy on private TVET provision\u2014related current legislation covers \nonly basic education\u2014and public-private partnerships (PPPs). While a systematic and longer-term approach to \nPPPs would be needed in Myanmar\u2019s current context, there may be particular prospects in the case of TVET.  \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \nplanning  including  guiding  future  capital  investments;22 and  (iii)  strengthening  management \ninformation systems (MIS), with a potential focus on integrating information on government \ntechnical high schools and other TVET institutions.23    \n \nOutput 2: new SES curriculum delivered and access expanded \n \n4.  Under the common reform agenda supported by output 1, PYWP\u2019s output 2 is expected \nto represent the only concerted subsector-level DPO support to SES in the coming years, and \nwill  assist  MOE  in  implementing  foundational  reforms  as  the  basis  for  the  longer-term, \nsequenced strengthening of SES. It will principally focus on improving quality and relevance of \nSES, with selective support to SES access and management dimensions, supporting higher \nLSE  enrolments  (including  by  increasing  the  primary-LSE  transition  rate)  as  well  as  USE \ncompletion rates (by increasing retention and pass rates). Subject to forthcoming joint design \ndialogue, output 2 would focus on 2 principle clusters of interventions or sub-outputs noted \nbelow,  each  of  which  will  include  linked  interventions  under  PYWP\u2019s  program  and  project \ncomponents. \n \n5.  The first sub-output will focus on strengthening the quality and relevance of SES\u2014which \nis currently a key demand-side factor undermining SES access and completion rates\u2014including \nvia support to MOE\u2019s reforms of the SES curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment.  Key thrusts \nare expected to include: (i) development, printing, and distribution of LSE and USE textbooks \nand teacher guides, which will emphasize critical thinking and other \u201c21st century skills\u201d, be more \nvocationally relevant, will align to Myanmar\u2019s rapidly evolving socioeconomic context, and will \npromote equity across gender, ethnic groups, and other dimensions;24 (ii) in-service teacher \ntraining and continuing professional development, to ensure that teachers nationwide are able \nto deliver the new LSE and USE curricula using student-centered, active learning approaches;25 \n(iii) reform of student assessment, including approaches to periodic testing in schools and \nnational LSE and USE completion examinations, to reverse their current effect in reinforcing \nrote-based pedagogy and learning;26 (iv) provision of teaching and learning equipment, with a \nlikely priority given to improving teaching and learning in science laboratories as well as school \nlibraries;27 and (iv) capacity development in priority areas and at different levels, ranging central \nMOE, to local MOE offices (e.g.,. to ensure school inspection and other local functions promote \ninnovative teaching in schools), and school managers in areas such as community engagement \nin school-based management, school improvement planning, and school block grant processes.   \n                                                 \n22 This support would complement support from other DPOs for primary and pre-primary education and would build \non ongoing efforts to collect basic information on existing school locations. School network mapping goes a step \nfurther, to map out demand versus existing supply of school facilities (e.g., to identify areas with large numbers of \nmiddle school students with no nearby high school or GTHS facilities).   \n23 The detailed focus of MIS-related support would incorporate findings from UNESCO\u2019s ongoing assessment of \nMOE\u2019s Education MIS, as well as dialogue with other DPOs to ensure consistency and a clear division of labor.  \n24 This would build on ongoing ADB support\u2014in partnership with Australia via 2 cofinanced TA projects (TA 8187 and \nTA 8385) and in close cooperation with Japanese assistance for primary education curriculum reform\u2014to MOE to \ndevelop the SES curriculum reform strategy, curricular frameworks, and detailed contents for the new LSE and \nUSE curricula.   \n25 Subject to further dialogue with MOE and clarity on emerging support from other DPOs, this may also include pre-\nservice teacher training as well as strengthened policies and mechanisms for teacher utilization and deployment \n(e.g., to address the current shortage of qualified science teachers in poorer rural areas). \n26 Output 2 may additionally support other dimensions, including development of policies to curb private tutoring, as \nwell as the pilot testing and introduction of instruments such as sample-based assessments of student learning \noutcomes (ASLO). \n27 Output 2 may also provide limited support for minimalist ICT equipment, prioritizing support to improved teaching \nacross all subjects and models  with low total cost of ownership (TCO), including maintenance and power \nconsumption.   ", "Appendix 4  15 \n \n \n6.  The second sub-output will provide more focused interventions to tackle both supply and \ndemand-side  deterrents  to  access.  Support  to  address  supply-side  constraints  to  physical \naccess is expected to include (i) support to MOE to develop new LSE and USE model school \ndesigns and standards, to ensure that new school structures are efficient (high quality and at \nmodest cost), minimize maintenance costs and are robust to disasters, and are accessible to \ndisabled children; and (ii) construction and upgrading of classrooms and dormitories\u2014with a \npotential  focus  on  upgrading  existing  branch  and  affiliated  schools  and  incomplete  middle \nschools (in Myanmar, termed \u201cpost-primary schools\u201d)\u2014based on the new standards and model \ndesigns. The program design stage will consolidate existing information on school locations and \nunder-supply of classrooms to identify a first batch of areas for prioritized support during the \nearly  stages  of  the  PYWP,  while  a  second  batch  of  areas  to  be  targeted  later  during \nimplementation will be to be finalized based on completion of the more rigorous school network \nmapping under output 1. Demand-side interventions to address cost barriers and promote \nincreased enrolment and completion may include (i) scale-up and evaluation of needs-based \nstipends, in joint dialogue with World Bank, Australia, and/or other DPOs providing related \nsupport;28 and/or (ii) launch of social marketing and other initiatives to promote increased LSE \nand USE enrolment and completion of girls and boys.   \n \nOutput 3: new TVET programs introduced and access expanded. \n \n7.  In parallel with output 2 and under the common reform agenda supported by output 1, \nPYWP\u2019s  output  3  will  include  linked  interventions  under  PYWP\u2019s  program  and  project \ncomponents.    The  main  focus  is  expected  to  be  on  the  replication  and  diversification  of \nCBMSCs under MOST, though joint design dialogue will explore potential focused coverage of \nother  institutions.29 The  detailed  scope  will  be  based  on  design  dialogue  with  MOST  and \npotential cofinancing DPOs, as well as close coordination with other DPOs expecting to support \nTVET in Myanmar (see also below).  In particular, it is expected that PYWP\u2019s policy matrix will \nembed  a  common  core  policy  matrix  for  TVET  that  would  be  jointly  formulated  with  the \ngovernment and other DPOs, thereby supporting unified policy dialogue and alignment of DPO \nsupport behind a common reform agenda.  \n \n8.  Subject  to  forthcoming  joint  design  dialogue,  support  focus  on  the  development  of \nrevised or new programs and curricula with strengthened quality and relevance.  The Program \nis expected to support 3 tiers or types of program (outlined below), with a principal focus on the \nfirst (CBMSCs targeted at disadvantaged youth and unskilled workers):  \n \n(i)  competency-based modular short courses (CBMSCs) for disadvantaged youth\u2014 \nPYWP will also scale-up and replicating CBMSCs being pilot tested under TA 8634 and \nexpanding to other selected skill areas, to be provided at selected GTHSs and other \nsites (see footnote 22), also allowing for fuller utilization of existing facilities.  These \nCBMSCs will open access to training in basic skills (level 1 and in some cases level 2) to \nyouth and young workers with limited formal education; and  \n(ii) advanced CBMSCs\u2014PYWP will additionally introduce develop, pilot test, and replicate \nnew programs, which may be somewhat longer in duration and focus on more advanced \n                                                 \n28 ADB has had initial discussions with MOE, World Bank, and Australian counterparts on participating in annual \nreviews of the new stipend scheme that is being pilot tested in selected townships starting in SY2015/16, as well as \njoint dialogue on strengthening its design. The PYWP could potentially support an expansion of this program after \nthe initial pilot phase, in coordination with other DPO support.   \n29 Via TA 8634 (financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction), ADB is supporting MOST and the Ministry of \nIndustry (MOI) in developing and pilot testing of CBMSCs, for potential replication under the PYWP. \n ", "16  Appendix 4 \nskills (e.g., skill levels 3 and perhaps 4). These CBMSCs will allow skill upgrading of \nworkers who already have basic skills and work experience, and will also be focused on \nspecific skill areas and based in existing GTHS and other participating TVET institutions; \n(iii) TVET-track USE\u2014Support to USE curriculum reform under output 2 and to develop \nnew CBMSC programs under output 3 will provide key building blocks for MOST\u2019s \nenhancement of GTHS programs, which are expected to be extended to 3 years in \nduration alongside MOE\u2019s extension of academic-track USE starting from SY2021/22. \nNamely, GTHS programs combine (a) selected academic subjects from the MOE USE \ncurriculum; and (b) additional vocational courses. PYWP\u2019s second output would thus \nsupport curriculum reform of the academic component, while development of CBMSCs \nunder PYWP output 3 would provide modules in selected skill areas for inclusion in new \nGTHS vocational course curricula, potentially augmented by curriculum developed with \nsupport from other DPOs (see para. 11 below). Pending further dialogue with relevant \nagencies and ongoing support by ADB and other DPOs to MOLES and NSSA to develop \nnew or revised skill standards, it is expected that GTHS graduates would be certified in \nselected skill areas up to level 3 or 4 in the emerging national skill standards system.30 \nPYWP  will  also  tap  ADB\u2019s  support  to  related  regional  dialogue  on  skill  standard \nalignment, particularly in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS).31   \n \n9.  Support  for  new  CBMSC  programs  will  include  (i)  program  scoping  and  curriculum \ndevelopment, in close dialogue with employers and other ministries, and aligned with learning \npathways developed under output 1; (ii) development, printing, and distribution of teaching and \nlearning materials; (iii) provision of equipment and materials for workshops, classrooms, and \nresource libraries; (iv) in-service teacher training and continuing professional development for \nfaculty in targeted TVET institutions and skill areas;32 (v) linked support to MOST and the \nNational Skill Standards  Authority (NSSA) under the Ministry of Labor, Employment, and Social \nSecurity (MOLES) to develop or enhance skill standards in skill areas covered by the CBMSCs, \nin close coordination with related assistance from Germany, Switzerland, and other DPOs; and \n(vi) support for skill/competency assessment and certification of individuals, and accreditation of \nTVET institutions to provide specific courses, to be linked to the revised skill standards.   \n \n10.  Output  3  will  also selectively  address  supply-  and  demand-side  obstacles  to  TVET \naccess. On the supply-side, support to advance physical access is expected to include (i) \nsupport to MOST to develop new designs and standards for TVET facilities (ranging from \nbuildings to safety features and equipment), emphasizing efficiency, low maintenance costs, \nsafety,  and  accessibility  to  disabled  trainees;  and  (ii)  construction  and/or  upgrading  of \nclassrooms,  workshops,  and  dormitories,  particularly  at  existing  government  technical  high \nschools  (GTHS)  and  potentially  also  government  technical  colleges  and/or  other  TVET \ninstitutions, based on the new standards and model designs. Project preparatory dialogue will \nidentify a first batch of TVET institutions\u2014which is expected to include an expansion of support \nto  GTHSs  in  Mandalay,  Naypyitaw,  Yangon  being  provided  under  ongoing  TA  8634\u2014for \nprioritized support during the early stages of the PYWP, with a second batch of institutions to be \n                                                 \n30 With support from ADB and other DPOs, Myanmar is developing a national qualifications framework that (as in \nmany regional neighbors) is expected to include 8 levels, with TVET graduates typically falling in levels 1-4. Level 1 \ncaptures workers\u2019 mastery of manual skills to perform under close supervision, while level 4 reflects broader and \ndeeper knowledge and skills and the ability to perform tasks with only broad guidance.   \n31 Program design will also consider developments related to establishment of an ASEAN Economic Community \n(AEC) by end of 2015, though it is noted that AEC provisions for human resources tend to focus principally on \nprofessional workers (e.g., accountants, engineers, and doctors) rather than TVET skill levels.  \n32 Capacity development under PYWP will complement potential support focused on TVET pedagogy (as opposed to \ntechnical content) being explored by other DPOs including Germany and Switzerland.      ", "Appendix 4  17 \n \nfinalized  based  on  unmet  demands  identified  via  school  network  mapping  (see  output  1). \nDemand-side  interventions  to  address  cost  barriers  and  promote  increased  demand  are \nexpected to include development, pilot testing, and evaluation of needs-based stipends and \nother support to TVET trainees; and (ii) launch of social marketing, local employer outreach, and \nother initiatives to promote increased interest among youth, workers, and employers in TVET as \nwell as increased employability of program graduates.   \n \n11.  Detailed  Program  design  dialogue  will  help  identify  specific  skill  area  coverage  for \nvocational  courses  at  GTHS  as  well  as  both  types  of  CBMSCs,  including  to  ensure \ncomplementarity  with  support  from  other  DPOs.    In  particular,  GIZ and  KfW  are  currently \ndeveloping a TVET Reform Programme, which will (among others) support GTHS and develop \nshort-courses in selected areas.33 Pending continued dialogue and design of both programs, \nGIZ  and  KfW  have  indicated  they  expect  to  focus  to  some  degree  on  metal  technology, \nmachining, electrical wiring and perhaps basic electronics, and mechatronics.34  In turn, PYWP \nmay focus on (i) replication of programs being pilot tested under TA 8634 (centered on building \nand construction as well as welding and repair and maintenance of motorcycles, tractors, and \nother  small  equipment);  (ii)  expansion  to  closely  linked  skill  areas,  such  as  carpentry  for \nconstruction,  scaffolding,  plumbing,  drainage/sewage,  masonry,  tile  work,  painting,  and \noperation of selected heavy machinery; and (iii) additional skill areas potentially including ICT \nnetwork and/or hardware technicians, air conditioning and other household appliances, other \nselected electronics-related skills, and/or food processing.35   \n \n \n                                                 \n33 Other examples include the Swiss-supported Vocational Skills Development Program, which includes components \non (i) hospitality industry training; (ii) mobile training programs; and (iii) skill standard development. \n34 Mechtronics is a loosely defined composite skill area including elements of electronics, automotive skills, metal \nworking, hydraulics, etc. \n35 All GTHS courses and CBMSC modules will embed workplace safety and first aid. Basic entrepreneurial skills will \nbe similarly integrated and/or added as stand-alone modules. \n "], "metadata": {"Producer": "GPL Ghostscript 9.14", "CreationDate": "D:20150713085008+08'00'", "ModDate": "D:20150713085008+08'00'", "Author": "cs8", "Creator": "PDF24 Creator", "Title": "Microsoft Word - draft concept_Myanmar Prep Youth for Workplace_cln4_3Jun15_SEOD rev_cln_CDsig.docx"}}
