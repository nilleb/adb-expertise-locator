I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nCorridors 3 and 5 Enhancement Project.1  \n \n2.  The project is located in the  Regions under Direct Republican Jurisdiction and the \nKhatlon region. To support regional cooperation and inclusive growth in the country, the project \nwill finance (i) the rehabilitation and reconstruction of approximately 175 kilometers (km) of the \nSayron\u2013Karamyk road section of CAREC corridors 3 and 5 and the subnetwork (the Vose\u2013\nKhovaling road); (ii) the enhancement of road safety and maintenance; and (iii) local community \ndevelopment  including  improving  rural  feeder  roads  and  public  facilities,  and  training  local \ncommunities.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Tajikistan is landlocked and depends on transport corridors for investment, job creation, \ntrade, and ultimately economic growth and poverty reduction. High transport costs, because of \nailing transport infrastructure and low network connectivity coupled with geographic isolation \nand  mountainous  terrain,  pose  a  significant  barrier  to  the  country\u2019s  economic  and  social \ndevelopment.3 The backbone of Tajikistan\u2019s national road network, comprising three CAREC \ncorridors and three Asian Highway (AH) routes, has been largely improved with assistance from \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners.4 The improved network \nenables  Tajikistan  to  serve  as  an  important  transit  route  in  Central  Asia.  With  continued \ntransport and trade facilitation support from ADB5 and other development partners, and the \nplanned  Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Tajikistan railway  construction  that  will  connect  southern \nTajikistan with Turkmenistan through planned Afghanistan railway network, the synergistic effect \nwill  offer  new  opportunities  to  intensify  regional  cooperation  and  trade,  particularly  with \nTajikistan\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization on 2 March 2013.  \n  \n4.  The overlapping portion of CAREC corridors 3 and 5\u2014from the capital Dushanbe to the \nKaramyk border with the Kyrgyz Republic\u2014is a largely two-lane highway of about 340 km. \nAround 160 km of the road passes along deep riverbanks and is difficult to widen because it is \nconstrained  by  mountainous  topography.  Because  of  the  government\u2019s  limited  budget  for \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2013. Technical \nAssistance to the Republic of Tajikistan for the CAREC Corridors 3 and 5 Enhancement Project. Manila. \n3  For example, the domestic freight rate between Dushanbe and Khujand (approximately 300 km apart) exceeds that \nbetween Moldova and the United States, according to the World Bank\u2019s latest Country Economic Memorandum on \nTajikistan (Report No. 54677-TJ) released in 2011. The cost to export (US$ per container) that includes inland \ntransport is 8,450 in Tajikistan, around four times of those in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, as per the World \nBank\u2019s Doing Business 2013 data for Tajikistan. \n4  CAREC corridor 3 (concurrently AH65) runs east\u2013west from the border with Uzbekistan through Dushanbe to the \nborder with the Kyrgyz Republic; CAREC corridor 6 (concurrently AH7) runs north\u2013south from the border with \nUzbekistan through Dushanbe to the border with Afghanistan; CAREC corridor 5 overlaps with corridor 3 from the \nborder  with  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  up  to  Dushanbe,  and with  corridor  6 from  Dushanbe  to  the  border  with \nAfghanistan; AH66 starts at Dushanbe and passes through Vakhdat, Dangara, Vose, Kulob, Khorug, and Murgob \nbefore reaching the Kulma Pass (to the People\u2019s Republic of China). \n5  ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Grants to \nthe Kyrgyz Republic and the Republic of Tajikistan for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Regional \nImprovement of Border Services Project. Manila. ", "2 \nimproving a longer section of road at the time the project was designed in 2006 and the limited \ntraffic forecasted at the time, the design for the Sayron\u2013Karamyk section adopted one asphalt \nconcrete layer.6 Additionally, other rehabilitation work such as rock excavation, drainage, and \nconcrete retaining walls was reduced in quantity because of a lack of funds. The rehabilitation of \nthe section was completed in August 2011. The traffic has since then surged in both volume and \naxle loading, degrading the pavement condition faster than initially anticipated.7 There is an \nimminent need to enhance the Sayron\u2013Karamyk section to extend road service life, and improve \nroad safety and maintenance for better serviceability. Moreover, because the traffic capacity on \nCAREC corridors 3 and 5 is likely to be realized earlier than expected, the connectivity and \ncapacity of the subnetwork will need improving.8  \n \n5.  The Vose\u2013Khovaling\u2013Tavildara road extends the first ADB-assisted road in Tajikistan, \nstarting at AH66 and connecting through the Darband\u2013Tavildara\u2013Kalaikhumb road to CAREC \ncorridors 3 and 5. This road was categorized as a republican (national) road during the Soviet \nera but has seriously deteriorated because of prolonged inadequate maintenance and recent \nflood damage, causing transport difficulty and safety concerns. The government has prioritized \nrehabilitating  the  Vose\u2013Khovaling  road,  with  the  Khovaling\u2013Tavildara  road  to  follow. \nImprovements to this stretch of road will (i) cut travel time almost in half from the Kyrgyz border \nto Khatlon; (ii) open a new trade corridor in the most populous region in Tajikistan; (iii) provide \neasier  access  to  southern  markets;  and  (iv)  enhance  economic  connections  with  CAREC \ncorridors 3 and 5, AH66, and Afghanistan and beyond.9  \n  \n6.  Progress has been made on policy and institutional reforms in Tajikistan\u2019s transport \nsector including (i) developing the Transport Sector Master Plan,10 (ii) restructuring the Ministry \nof Transport (MOT), (iii) strengthening maintenance, and (iv) building procurement capacity \nthrough introducing competitive bidding. While more sector activities including developing a road \ncondition database and strengthening vehicle overloading controls are under way, substantial \ngaps remain. The core problems are poor road connectivity and serviceability, deteriorating \ninfrastructure network, deficient asset management, limited private sector involvement, and \nlimited  institutional  capacity.  Poor  connectivity  and  high  transport  costs  have  caused \nconstrained economic and social development. Under the project, ADB will help improve the \nconnectivity and strengthen institutional capacity in road safety and maintenance. \n \n7.  The  improvement  of  the  regional  and  national  transportation  network  remains  the \ngovernment\u2019s top priority, as stressed in its Living Standards Improvement Strategy of Tajikistan \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grant to the Republic of Tajikistan for the CAREC Regional Road Corridor Improvement \nProject. Manila. The project will be closed in September 2013 upon completion of the ongoing institutional \nstrengthening component.   \n7  Traffic on CAREC corridors 3 and 5 grew at about 15% per year in 2005\u20132012. International traffic passing the \nKaramyk border increased from about 10 trucks per day in 2006 to around 100 trucks per day in 2012. The \naverage daily traffic on the corridor in 2012 reached 2,000 vehicles comprising over 50% trucks.  \n8  For example, the rehabilitation of the Kurgonteppa\u2013Dangara road is nearly finished; the extensional rehabilitation \nwork for the Dangara\u2013Khovaling road is ongoing. The improvement of the Darband\u2013Tavildara\u2013Kalaikhumb road \nthat links CAREC corridors 3 and 5 to AH66 is planned for 2014, the project feasibility study of which is near \ncompletion. Sections of AH66 between Kulob and Murgob are being rehabilitated or planned for improvement in 3\u2013\n5 years. \n9  The road will alleviate future traffic pressure to the national capital by providing a new conduit for southbound \ntraffic. Multimodal goods transport at Vose rail station was functioning efficiently before the Tajik rail line got \ndisconnected from the Uzbekistan rail network. With the extension of southern Tajik rail line to connect with the \nplanned Afghanistan rail network, goods can again be efficiently transported through AH66 and CAREC corridors 5 \nand 6 or through the planned rail network.  \n10 ADB. 2011.

The project is part \nof the country\u2019s Transport Sector Development Program up to 2025 and is included in the \ngovernment\u2019s 2014\u20132016 Public Investment Program. It also fits well with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 \nin two core operational areas (infrastructure, and regional cooperation and integration) and is in \nline with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Tajikistan, 2010\u20132014.11   \n \n8.  ADB assistance to Tajikistan\u2019s transport sector has been successful. The government \nand development partners recognize transport as one of ADB\u2019s main areas of expertise. The \nproject design incorporates key lessons learned from past experience including (i) obtaining \ngovernment assurances on project sustainability, (ii) expanding the project\u2019s social development \nbenefits  for  more  inclusive  development,  and  (iii)  using  advance  contracting  to  avoid \nimplementation delays. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact of the project will be enhanced regional economic cooperation and inclusive \neconomic  growth  in  Tajikistan.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  regional  network  (CAREC \ncorridors 3 and 5 and the subnetwork) connectivity. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n10.  The project outputs will be (i) improved road conditions and enhanced road safety on \nCAREC corridors 3 and 5 (the Sayron\u2013Karamyk road section, 88 km) and the subnetwork (the \nVose\u2013Khovaling  road,  87  km)  totaling  175  km;  (ii)  extended  access  to  local  communities \nthrough the improvement of rural feeder roads; and (iii) institutional strengthening of project \nmanagement, contract supervision, and efficient road maintenance.  \n \n11.  Improved  road  condition  and  enhanced  road  safety. The scope of rehabilitation \nand/or  reconstruction  work  for  the  Vose\u2013Khovaling  road  (category  IV)  includes  selective \nwidening  at  substandard  sections;  the  easing  of  vertical  and  horizontal  alignments  at  key \nlocations; earthworks; pavement milling and overlay; the construction and/or rehabilitation of \nbridges, culverts, and drains; and roadside improvements and safety engineering features such \nas traffic signs, road markings, traffic barriers, sidewalks, road lighting, and slope protection \nmeasures.  The  scope  of  road  enhancement  work  on  the  Sayron\u2013Karamyk  road  section \n(category IV) includes remedial works of the base and/or subgrade layers in weak subsections; \npavement overlay; the installation of improved drains in problematic areas; slope stabilization \nworks in areas with regular rock fall risks; and road safety improvements including traffic signs, \nroad markings, traffic barriers, road lighting, and slope protection measures. The existing road \ncategory will be maintained and level of service improved for both road sections.12  \n \n12.  Extended  access  to  local  communities.  The  project  will  contribute  to  the  social \ndevelopment of local communities by improving about 30 km of village feeder roads in the Vose \nand Khovaling districts, constructing roadside rest areas for male and female vendors and \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2008.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n19.  The project roads link northeastern and southern Tajikistan and provide connections \namong provincial areas, subdistricts, and the surrounding rural area. Inadequate maintenance \nand natural disasters have led to rapid road deterioration and necessitate improvement  to \nensure the safe and efficient movement of people and goods. The design and implementation \nmodalities  were  selected  in  consideration  of  the  technical  viability,  traffic  safety,  and  road \nsustainability. For example, the road design allows flexibility for locations constrained by terrain \nand  right-of-way,  maximizes  the  use  of  local  construction  materials,  and  minimizes \nenvironmental and involuntary resettlement impacts. Climate resilience measures such as soil \nbioengineering for slope stabilization, solar energy installations for road safety, and special river \nbank protection for flood-prone road sections have been integrated in the road rehabilitation \nplan. Performance-based road maintenance will also be adopted to improve road service quality \nand prolong service life. \n \n20.  Road safety audits, and safety-related training and community awareness education \nprograms will be conducted before the road safety improvements are carried out. A review of \nroad  safety  will  continue  throughout  implementation,  including  a  post-construction  audit  to \ncorrect any potential deficiencies. Safety improvement measures, primarily simple and low-cost \nsolutions, have been incorporated in the design to mitigate safety concerns as a result of the \npotential increase in traffic speed and volume after road rehabilitation. Road safety will be \nsubstantially  improved with  the  provision  of traffic  signs,  line  markings,  marked  pedestrian \ncrossings protected by speed control devices, and slope stabilization measures in mountainous \nsections  where  soil  erosion,  rock  and  debris  flow,  and  slope  failure  often  obstruct  traffic \nthroughout the year. Traffic calming devices and road lights will also be constructed to promote \nspeed reduction at access points and improve safety through villages along the project roads. \n  \n21.  The sustainability and efficiency of road maintenance operations will be increased by \n(i) maximizing the use of local construction materials, (ii) applying weighbridges to reduce undue \nroad damage from vehicle overloading, and (iii) introducing a performance-based mechanism \nfor contracting road maintenance to private sectors. The design solutions and performance-\nbased maintenance will benefit local road agencies whose maintenance operations have been \nhampered by a lack of equipment and skilled labor force, and a high volume of maintenance \nwork. With the expected institutional improvements, MOT\u2019s road maintenance program will be \nstrengthened and relevant local road agencies and/or organizations will develop the necessary \ncapacity for sustainable road maintenance. \n \n22.  The minor upgrading to an all-weather surface of about 30 km of road that connects \nvillage feeder roads in the Vose and Khovaling districts will further improve access to basic \nsocial services such as schools, hospitals, and local markets. These roads will be selected from \nthe  list  approved  by  MOT  and  local  governments  based  on  (i)  geographic  location,  (ii) \nsafeguards  consideration,  (iii) social  and  economic  aspects,  and  (iv)  opportunities  for \ncooperation  with  other  poverty  alleviation  projects  in  the  area.  Consultations  with  local \ngovernments and residents of rural villages will be conducted in identifying roads for repair. The \nlocal  governments  will  be  responsible  for  the  continued  maintenance  following  the  road \nimprovement. \n \n \n ", "  7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  The economic analysis compared with-project and without-project scenarios. The project \neconomic  benefits  include  (i)  vehicle  operating  cost  savings,  (ii)  travel  time  savings, \n(iii) generated traffic, and (iv) road safety benefits. The project is economically viable, with a \nconsolidated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 23.2% (28.9% for the Sayron\u2013Karamyk \nroad section and 15.9% for the Vose\u2013Khovaling road). The sensitivity analysis pertaining to \ncapital investment and economic and traffic growth was conducted to assess the robustness of \nthe results of the economic analysis. The results show the project will maintain its economic \nviability under unfavorable scenarios. A quantitative risk analysis has also been carried out to \nreinforce the economic appraisal results, with two key variables relating to construction cost and \neconomic growth incorporated. Risk analysis results show that the minimum risk-based EIRR \npredicted for the Sayron\u2013Karamyk road section is 23.1%, with a 95% probability that the EIRR \nwill be above 24.6%; and 14.4% for the Vose\u2013Khovaling road, with a 95% probability that the \nEIRR will be above 15.1%.  \n \n24.  The project financial sustainability is deemed strong because (i) funding for the main \nworks comes directly from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund grant, with the government providing \ncounterpart funding mainly for taxes and duties, land acquisition and resettlement costs, and \ncontingencies. As such, issues regarding government funding shortage will have negligible \nfinancial impact on the project; (ii) the project aligns well with other development activities such \nas rural growth, disaster mitigation, and education from other development partners including \nthe European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, German development cooperation \nthrough KfW, United Nations Development Programme, World Food Programme; and (iii) the \ngovernment  is  committed  to  provide  funds  to  complete  any  required  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement.  The  government  has  increased  the  road  maintenance  budget  continuously, \ndespite  fiscal  constraints.  State  budget  allocations  for  road  maintenance  increased  from \nTJS13.5 million ($4.4 million equivalent) in 2004 to TJS52.7 million ($11.1 million equivalent) in \n2013. While this is still less than half of the nationwide maintenance needs, this budget outlay \nwill continue to increase by about 15% per year during 2013\u20132017, and road maintenance \ncontinues to be prioritized by road importance.  \n \nC.  Governance  \n \n25.  The assessments of MOT\u2019s procurement and financial management capacity, among \nother governance-related aspects, confirmed that its PIU has sufficient capacity to manage \ninternational and national procurement and has no major financial management deficiencies. \nThe unit\u2019s policies and procedures are adequate and in line with national and international \nlegislation and ADB requirements. The PIU is capable of making timely payments, correctly \nrecording  all  transactions  and  balances,  supporting  the  preparation  of  regular  and  reliable \nfinancial statements, and safeguarding its assets. Further improvement areas include more \ntransparent operations such as inviting civil society organizations to observe public biddings, \nstreamlining the PIU business processes with more quality control measures, regularly updating \noperational tools, and providing necessary training for finance, accounting, and procurement \nstaff. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \ndiscussed with, the government and MOT. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 14). \n \n \n ", "8 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n27.  In consultation with communities on and near project roads, strong enthusiasm was \nexpressed for the planned road improvement. The long travel time to markets and limited \nelectricity  supply  for  food  processing  activities  relegates  women  to  the  lower  end  of  the \nagricultural  production  value  chain.  Increased  connectivity  will  benefit  women  and  men  in \naccess to social services and trade. The project will significantly benefit them by reducing travel \ntime to reach social services and markets. Moreover, by improving transport in the area, the \nproject will help other poverty alleviation projects from development partners realize their full \npotential. \n \n28.  Many local men of working age are away working overseas, so the women left behind \nhave to earn cash for daily expenses in addition to their responsibilities for the household and \ncaring for the sick and elderly. To expand benefits for women, the project will finance roadside \npublic facilities for women\u2019s improved comfort and income generation, street lighting and road \nsafety measures, and feeder roads for improved access to poor villages not located on the main \nroad. Women will gain a share of project-related jobs (including those in construction and \nmaintenance), take advantage of rest areas and stopping points along the road to sell goods \nand services, and profit from increased tourism, e.g., to the shrine, the Vose museum, and the \nresort (all located in Khovaling). Training will be provided to improve livelihoods and develop \nentrepreneurship, raise road safety awareness, combat HIV/AIDS and human trafficking, and \nimprove gender awareness in local communities. \n \n29.  Tajikistan  depends  on  hydropower  to  solve  its  energy  needs,  but  in  rural  areas\u2014\nparticularly during winter when glacial melt is at its lowest and energy demand at the highest\u2014\nenergy cuts, including for traffic lights, restrict the movement of people and goods, and harm \neconomic  activities. With  abundant  solar  energy  resource  in  project  areas,  the  project  will \nenhance road safety by introducing photovoltaic solar applications to power street lights and \npublic facilities along the road corridor. The project will also demonstrate photovoltaic solar \nsolutions in three off-grid villages on or near project roads to help mitigate greenhouse gas \nemissions by replacing the use of fossil-intensive fuels (e.g., kerosene and diesel) for lighting \nand diesel generators for power supply. This will contribute to improved living standards by \nhaving efficient and environment friendly illumination, increased and better trading opportunities, \naccess to electronic media, and more time to study for children.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  Environment (category B). Due diligence confirmed that the project does not pass \nthrough  any  environmentally  sensitive  areas  and  will  not  result  in  significant  negative \nenvironmental impacts. MOT prepared an initial environmental examination (IEE) according to \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and national legislation and regulations. The IEE was \ndisclosed on the ADB website on 19 June 2013. The project will have temporary and reversible \nenvironmental impacts during implementation. Project-affected people were consulted. The IEE \nincludes an environmental management plan to minimize the project\u2019s potential environmental \nimpacts. The environmental management  capacity of MOT will be strengthened by a new \nenvironmental and social officer position in the PIU. MOT, assisted by an international firm, will \nbe responsible for implementing the plan and submitting semiannual monitoring reports to ADB.  \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category B) and indigenous peoples (category C). In the \nVose\u2013Khovaling road section, the impacts are mostly minor such as the impact on fences and \nwall structures except for four households and business entities that will likely be adversely \n ", "  9 \nimpacted; while in the Sayron\u2013Karamyk road section, land acquisition impact is not expected. \nMOT prepared a resettlement plan according to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and \nnational legislation and regulations to mitigate the impacts and assigned a dedicated staff with \nresources  to  carry  out  the  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  activity  of  the  project.  The \nresettlement plan was disclosed to affected persons through public consultations, and on the \nADB website on 21 June 2013. MOT will submit an updated resettlement plan to ADB if any \nchanges are made during implementation, following the finalization of the detailed design.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.15 The integrated project benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh the project costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInadequate road  The government covenants to increase annual road maintenance budget from \nmaintenance  TJS3,000/kilometer in 2013 to TJS7,000/kilometer in 2017, or increase at the same \nrate as increases of the national budgets during 2014\u20132017, whichever is higher.  \nUnder the project, vehicle overloading control measures will be implemented to \nreduce undue road damage. Performance-based road maintenance for project \nroads will be contracted out to private sectors following project completion, which \nshould ensure good levels of maintenance.   \nWeak executing  The Ministry of Transport, assisted by implementation consultants, is gaining \nagency capacity  experience from a similar community development component under another Asian \nin implementing  Development Bank (ADB) road project approved in September 2012.  \ncommunity \nFor the solar energy installations, consulting services (including technical support \ndevelopment \nand capacity development) will be recruited through the research and development \nsubcomponents \ntechnical assistance for Effective Deployment of Distributed Small Wind Power \nother than civil \nSystems in Asian Rural Areas to provide extensive training to the project \nworks \nimplementation unit and local communities on related installation, repair, and \nmaintenance.a Additionally, operation and maintenance contract of 2\u20133 years will be \nprocured from the supplier or separate service provider. \nGovernment fails  The government's allocation of adequate funds and resources for implementation of \nto fund land  the resettlement plan is covenanted in the grant agreement.  \ncompensation, \nADB will field safeguards review missions from time to time in addition to regular \nresettlement, and \nproject implementation reviews.
