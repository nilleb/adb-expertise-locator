The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested technical \nassistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to implement a new national strategy \nfor soil and water conservation that was previously prepared with ADB TA.1 The proposed TA2 is \nincluded  in  the  PRC  Country  Strategy  and  Program  for  2004\u20132006.  In  response  to  the \nGovernment\u2019s  request,  a  TA  fact-finding  mission  visited  the  PRC  in  June  2004  to  hold \ndiscussions with staff from the Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) and the Ministry of Finance, \nand a memorandum of understanding has been signed with the Government covering the \ndetailed objectives, scope, cost, implementation, and financing arrangements for the TA. The TA \nframework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The PRC has many of the worst land degradation problems in the world, with over 40% \nof its land area, 3.0 million\u20134.0 million square kilometers adversely affected. Although data are \ninconsistent, trends in land degradation appear to be worsening. Water erosion contributes \nabout 64% of the problem; wind erosion, 6%; and organic matter loss and salinization, 30%. \nDaily economic losses from land degradation are estimated at approximately CNY176 million \n($21.2 million equivalent), and indirect economic losses, including public health effects, are \nthought to be over four times higher.3 The social and economic consequences include lower \nincomes and increased poverty in many rural communities, higher unemployment rates, and \nhigher migration rates.  \n \n3.  The Government is making a major effort to combat land degradation as a national \ndevelopment priority. During the 1990s, total public investment programs almost tripled, to over \nCNY54 billion. Investment in soil and water conservation by MWR has increased considerably in \nrecent years to about CNY2 billion ($241million equivalent) in 2003. But this rate of increase has \nmerely kept pace with the growth in the economy as a whole. Investment by MWR is equivalent \nto 0.08% of gross domestic product (GDP), which appears low given that the cost of land \ndegradation to the PRC as a whole is considered to be at least equivalent to about 4% of annual \nGDP. Evaluation of government-financed programs to determine the overall impact and the \ncost-effectiveness of the broad range of interventions that have been implemented by MWR and \nother agencies has not been common in the past. However, during the formulation of the 11th \nFive-Year Plan (2006\u20132010), the Government is attaching importance to adopting a \u201cscientific, \ncomprehensive, and participatory approach\u201d in the future so that development is sustainable. \nAdequately valuing the costs and the economic, ecological, and social benefits of increased \npublic investment in alternative interventions to conserve soil and water is a vital part of this \nmore scientific approach. \n \n4.  Many externally assisted projects related to soil and water conservation have been \nundertaken in the PRC. Apart from ADB, the sources of external assistance include the Food \nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, United Nations Development Programme \n(UNDP), World Bank, and bilateral assistance from, for example, the governments of Australia, \n                                                 \n1\n ADB. 2000.

ADB provided several TAs4 to help develop the \nPRC-GEF Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems, resulting in a long-term \ncountry programming framework (CPF) for $1.5 billion equivalent covering a 10-year period \n(2003\u20132012), which was approved by the GEF council in October 2002. ADB\u2019s first project \nunder the partnership was approved in June 2004. In addition, ADB approved two TAs5 to help \nassess the poverty impact of the Government\u2019s ongoing forest and grassland development \nprojects. The World Bank and Department for International Development is also conducting a \nstudy in evaluating the poverty impact of the World Bank project interventions in the Loess \nplateau. The China Council for International Cooperation on Environment and Development \n(CCICED)6 has also evaluated the socioeconomic impact of some of government programs, \ne.g., the Task Force on Forest and Grasslands.  \n \n5.  As part of its program to assist the Government address the increasing problems of land \ndegradation, ADB TA 3548 helped the Government formulate a new strategy for soil and water \nconservation.  It  provided  a  comprehensive,  scientific,  and  participatory  approach  from  the \n\u201cbottom-up,\u201d  replacing  the  previous  \u201ctop-down\u201d  and  centrally  planned  approach.  The  new \nstrategy has the following elements: (i) formulating state, provincial, and local government policy \nframeworks for sustainable land management through a multisector and interagency approach, \nand recognizing the links between poverty and land degradation; (ii) reforming the water and soil \nconservation legislation regime and reducing overlaps and maximizing synergies in environment \nlegislation; (iii) strengthening human resources and devolving institutional responsibilities and \naccountability;  and  (iv) shifting  from  treating  the  symptoms  to  tackling  the  root  causes. \nAppendix 2 presents a summary of the new strategy. \n \n6.  The work done under this TA involved leading domestic scientists and overseas experts, \nand reflected the results of international and domestic best practices. As a result, the new \nstrategy  is  highly  regarded  in  the  PRC.  MWR  has  used  the  process  and  the  report\u2019s \nrecommendations to stimulate internal debate and better understand the complex web of causes \nand effects of land degradation. The top leadership of MWR is committed to a fundamental shift \nin emphasis and approach as recommended in the report and has communicated this to the \nlocal level. Based upon this TA, MWR has approved a new national strategy for soil and water \nconservation and has taken other specific measures.7 \n \n7.  To now move further to communicate the new strategy for soil and water conservation \nwidely to the leaders of other agencies and to assist in implementation, further ADB support has \n                                                 \n4\n ADB. 2000.

CCICED makes annual recommendations to the Government, at the highest level, on the \nformulation and implementation of long-term strategies and policies for sustainable development.  \n7\n  MWR has taken the following specific measures: (i) developed a pilot program for ecological restoration based on \nnatural processes in 128 counties; (ii) issued a ministerial document, jointly with the Ministry of Agriculture, on \nStrengthening  Ecological  Restoration  in  Soil  and  Water  Conservation  and  Promoting  Grassland  Protection \n(4 September 2004); (iii) launched the first phase of the National Soil and Water Conservation Monitoring Network \n(in April 2004); and (iv) is drafting Regulations for Public Participation in Soil and Water Conservation, to provide a \nmechanism for public involvement at the local level. \n ", "3 \nbeen requested as follows: \n \n(i)  Building awareness of the new strategy. The main elements of the strategy \nneed  to  be  promoted  as  the  previous  \u201ctop-down\u201d  planning  process  is  being \nreplaced by a participatory approach. A brief for the National People\u2019s Congress \nto gain full support from the national leadership is an important output.  \n(ii)  Improvement  of  the  policy,  legislative,  and  institutional  environment. \nTA 3548 initially assessed the PRC\u2019s key policies and legislation in soil and water \nconservation and found many overlaps and inconsistencies at the national and \nprovincial levels. There is a need to improve the quality of the current water and \nsoil conservation regime to create an enabling legal and institutional environment \nfor controlling land degradation.8 \n(iii)  Determining the costs and benefits of controlling land degradation. TA 3548 \nalso found that there was no consistent methodology for estimating the costs and \nbenefits of measures to combat land degradation in the PRC. Standard costs \nhave been calculated for a number of different engineering and vegetative control \nmeasures, but few attempts have been made to determine the economic value of \nthe on-site (farm field level) and off-site (small-watershed and river-basin level) \nbenefits that could accrue from adopting such measures. TA 3548 prepared a \nmethodology and the estimated annual benefits from conservation were CNY223 \nper hectare for the whole of the PRC and CNY280 per hectare for the Yangtze \nRiver basin (in the range $27 to $34 equivalent). The profitability of soil and water \nconservation was also estimated for Loess plateau, Yangtze river area, and PRC \nas a whole. The analysis showed that past soil and water conservation was \neconomically efficient, with the benefit-cost ratio in a range of 1.0 to 1.5, and \nincreasing to a range of 1.8 to 2.7 when off-site benefits were included. However, \nthere  is  a  need  to  expand  this  work  to  develop  a  methodology  to  include \n(i) reduction in soil pollution, (ii) reduction in salinity, (iii) combating desertification, \n(iv) expansion  in  forested  areas,  and  (v) conversion  of  farmland  to  other \npurposes. This analysis can guide future prioritization of investments in soil and \nwater conservation.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n8.  The long-term sector goal of the TA is to combat land degradation and support the \nGovernment\u2019s sustainable development strategy. The immediate objective of the TA is to assist \nthe Government to implement the new national strategy for soil and water conservation within \nthe MWR and at provincial level. The TA will have the following outputs: (i) improved awareness \nat the central and local levels of the new strategy; (ii) recommendations on revising the 1991 \nWater and Soil Conservation Law; (iii) an agreed practical methodology for valuing costs and \nbenefits  of  soil  and  water  conservation;  and  (iv)  support  for  a  prefeasibility  study  of  an \ninvestment project suitable for development partner financing in a selected area. \n                                                 \n8\n  A large amount of work is under way to improve the quality of environmental law and regulations. In part it is \nsupported by ADB through (i) PRC-GEF OP12 Partnership on Land Degradation, (ii) OGC\u2019s ongoing program on \nSupport for Environmental Legislation in the PRC, (iii) other TAs, e.g., ongoing ADB. 2002.

ADB is helping the Government proceed toward viable solutions, and through this TA, \nwill focus on a key environmental law. \n ", "4 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will take into account the relevant findings of previous ADB-funded TAs and \nother  studies  and  will  assess  international  and  domestic  best  practices  and  available \nmethodologies  for  valuing  economic,  ecological,  and  social  benefits  of  soil  and  water \nconservation. The TA will propose a practical framework for such valuation and apply the \nproposed  framework  to  selected  sites.  Various  seminars  and  training  workshops  will  be \nconducted at the national level for consensus building, and at the river-basin and local levels for \nawareness and capacity building. The TA will comprise the following activities: \n \n(i)  Preparing briefing materials on the strategy and action plan for the National \nPeople\u2019s Congress; \n(ii)  Developing training handbooks and brochures, and web site materials on the new \nsoil and water conservation strategy for training workshops at different levels; \n(iii)  Conducting two seminars at the national level for planners and policy makers \nrelating  to  soil  and  water  conservation  and  land  degradation  to  reach  a \nconsensus on the new soil and water conservation strategy; also, conducting one \nseminar at the river-basin level and three workshops at the local level for a better \nunderstanding of the strategy; \n(iv)  Carrying out three training workshops for practitioners at the county level on \nparticipation and the bottom-up approach in soil and water conservation; \n(v)  Assessing international experience in soil and water conservation legislation, and \nmaking recommendations for revising the 1991 Water and Soil Conservation \nLaw.  A  national  workshop  involving  international  specialists  on  selected \ncountry/regional soil and water conservation laws and evaluation of work done in \nTA 3548 will be held in Beijing on June 2005; \n(vi)  Analyzing  available  methodologies  for  valuing  the  economic,  ecological,  and \nsocial benefits of soil and water conservation, proposing a practical framework, \nand applying it in sample areas of the western, black soil, and red soil regions to \nthe provincial or county level; and  \n(vii)  Supporting the EA to conduct a prefeasibility study for a selected area suitable for \ndevelopment partner financing.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $476,000 equivalent, comprising $123,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $353,000 equivalent in local currency costs. It is proposed that ADB \nfinance $379,000 equivalent, consisting of the entire foreign exchange costs and $256,000 \nequivalent in local costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB's TA funding \nprogram. The Government of the PRC will provide the balance of local costs, equivalent to \n$97,000 to cover in-kind counterpart costs and services. The detailed cost estimates are given \nin Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  MWR  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  TA.  A  steering  committee  will  be \nestablished,  chaired  by  the  vice  minister  of  MWR,  to  provide  overall  guidance  for  TA \nimplementation. The steering committee members will consist of MWR, Ministry of Finance, \nNational Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Land and Resources, Ministry of \nAgriculture, State Environment Protection Administration, and State Forest Administration. The \nsteering committee will have three meetings, each at TA Inception, midterm review, and final \n ", "5 \nphase  of  implementation.  A  TA  management  office,  comprising  MWR\u2019s  Department  of \nInternational  Cooperation,  Science  and  Technology,  Department  of  Soil  and  Water \nConservation, and other departments as necessary, will be established for daily coordination \nand administration of the TA, and for liaising with ADB. MWR will assign an experienced staff \nmember of MWR to serve as a TA task manager, as well as counterpart staff who will work \nclosely with the TA consultants. MWR will also provide office space, access to communications \nand photocopiers, and logistical support for TA implementation using counterpart funds.9 \n \n12.  The TA will be carried out over a period of 12 months commencing in November 2004 \nand  completing  by  end-November  2005.  A  total  of  29  person-months  (p/m)  of  consulting \nservices will be required for the TA, comprising 5 p/m of international and 24 p/m of domestic \nconsultants. The international consultants will comprise (i) a natural resources development \neconomist (2.5 p/m), with expertise in the economics of soil and water conservation; and (ii) one \nor two legal experts (a total of 2.5 p/m), with sound soil and water conservation law experience \nin  selected  countries  with  best  practices.  The  domestic  consultants  will  comprise:  (i) a  TA \ncoordinator  (6  p/m),  (ii) a  natural  resources  economist  (10  p/m),  (iii) a  seminar/workshop \nfacilitator (2 p/m), (iv) a legal expert (3 p/m), and (v) a project economist (3 p/m). The terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 4.  \n \n13.  ADB will select and engage consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  itself  in  respect  of  the  selection  and \nengagement of domestic consultants. The international consultants and domestic consultants \nwill be engaged on an individual basis, directly or through an organization, such as an academic \ninstitution, a government or international agency, or a consulting firm. Advance payment may be \nprovided to the EA to facilitate the implementation of the seminars and workshops.  \n \n14.  At the end of the first month, the consultant will submit an inception report and seminar \nand workshop plan to the Government and ADB, which will be discussed in a tripartite review \nmeeting (TRM). An interim report will be submitted to the Government and ADB at the end of the \nfifth month from the start of the TA, the findings of which will be discussed in a seminar or \nworkshop, in which stakeholders will take part, and subsequently in a second TRM. A draft final \nreport will be submitted to the Government and ADB, 1 month before the end of the assignment, \nwhich will be presented by the consultant at the second national seminar. A third TRM will be \nheld prior to the conclusion of the TA to discuss the draft final report. The suggestions and \ncomments generated during the second national seminar and the third TRM will be incorporated \ninto the TA final report, which will be submitted to the Government and ADB at the end of the \n12-month TA implementation period. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $379,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Implementation of the National Strategy \nfor Soil and Water Conservation, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n9\n MWR, by itself, cannot achieve an integrated approach by all relevant agencies. However, by adopting the new \nstrategy it can demonstrate its value to the other agencies. As illustrated in para. 6 and footnote 7, a start has also \nbeen made in improving interagency coordination between MWR and the Ministry of Agriculture. The steering \ncommittee for the PRC-GEF OP12 Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems (which coordinates 11 \nkey agencies in this area) will also be kept informed. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nGoal       \nLand degradation problem  Increased government budget  Government   \naddressed effectively  for soil and water conservation  documents and   \nthrough sustainable  program under 11th Five-Year  reports.

Background  \n \n1.  In the 1998 floods, the worst for 50 years in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nmassive physical damage (over $20 billion equivalent) and loss of life occurred. Increasing land \ndegradation, including wind and water erosion, chemical and physical soil deterioration, mostly \nas a result of poor land use decisions over a long period of time, was largely responsible for \ncreating  the  preconditions  for  such  extensive  devastation.  Land  degradation  affects  most \nprovinces, water tables are declining in many areas, and desertification is expanding in the drier \nand more fragile areas of the west and central regions. Overstocking of animals on grasslands \nhas increased the spread of deserts and reduced biodiversity. Increasing sand and dust storms \noriginating from degraded dryland areas are adversely affecting the quality of life and are a \nglobal problem. With per capita arable land of only 0.11 hectares, shrinking farm areas can \nencourage nonviable farming practices. Land degradation is correlated with poverty; almost \n90% of the rural poor live on degraded land.  \n \n2.  The Government has been implementing soil and water conservation programs for the \npast 50 years, and since the 1998 floods the level of expenditures has significantly increased. \nThere  are  also  many  sector  plans  and  programs  administered  by  different  agencies\u2014but \ncoordination is a challenge, feedback mechanisms are weak, and overlaps in jurisdictions and \nresponsibilities are common. As a result, the level of efficiency in achieving the desired impact \nof public expenditures is low. An extensive body of legislation and regulation exists but this does \nnot clearly provide for an effective framework to address soil and water conservation. Running \nthrough the relevant legislation is an emphasis on production over conservation. Various terms \nrelating to sustainable land use often appear but without clear definitions or consistent and \nnationally agreed indicators or data. Overall, water and soil conservation policy places an \nemphasis on \u201csoil erosion\u201d and \u201cdesertification\u201d with less mention of other principal forms of land \ndegradation, i.e., salinity, acidification, vegetation decline, or nutrient decline. Moreover, various \npolicies call for a broadening of the national policy framework for water and soil conservation, \nincluding an effective multisector approach, and an improvement of the links between land \ntenure, poverty, and food security.  \n \n3.  Aware of the need for a more comprehensive approach, the Government requested \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) in 2000 to develop a new strategy. \nThe work done under this TA 35481 is highly regarded in the PRC. The Ministry of Water \nResources (MWR) has used the process and the report\u2019s recommendations to stimulate internal \ndebate and better understand the complex web of causes and effects of land degradation, and \nhas adopted the recommended strategy.  \n \n4.  The  objective  of  TA  3548  was  to  address  soil  and  water  conservation  in  a \ncomprehensive manner (not limited to existing institutional boundaries) and map out a strategic \napproach to control all forms of land degradation. The extent and severity of land degradation \nwas to be assessed, lessons drawn from past projects were to be analyzed and a pipeline of \npotential projects for future investment proposed, and a progress monitoring and evaluation \nsystem designed. MWR has accepted the strategy as outlined in the final report of this TA. \n                                                 \n1\n  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing National Strategy for Soil and \nWater Conservation. Manila. \n ", "Appendix 2  9 \nB.  The New Strategy \n \n5.  The twin goals of the strategy are (i) sustainable and productive use of natural resources \n(soil, vegetation, and water) in ways that are ecologically sound, economically viable, and \nsocially  acceptable  and  equitable;  and  (ii) prevention  of  further  land  degradation,  and  the \nrestoration of a productive and protective function in currently degraded areas. The strategy is \nbased on sustainability in terms of ecological, social, economic, livelihood, and institutional \nimpacts. The following are the key concepts and principles: \n \n(i)  A  holistic  and  integrated  approach  is  needed,  in  which  land  degradation \nproblems  (not  just  soil  erosion)  are  dealt  with,  within  the  constraints  and \nopportunities of land users. Integrated land management is more than just soil \nand water conservation, as it touches on the totality of rural household livelihood \nsystems,  and  the  improvement  of  the  productivity  and  sustainability  of  crop, \nlivestock, and tree-based enterprises. \n(ii)  Adoption of participatory approaches is essential to overcome the failings in past \n\u201ctop-down\u201d soil conservation and agricultural production projects. \n(iii)  Land degradation is a multidimensional problem that cuts across different sector \ndevelopment  interests  and  administrative  responsibilities.  Tackling  land \ndegradation requires an interagency approach, as no one ministry or department \nhas the full range of disciplinary expertise or statutory responsibility to deal with it \nalone.2 \n(iv)  An enabling policy and legislative environment is needed, which allows rural \ncommunities to take primary responsibility for the preservation and management \nof their local natural resources. \n(v)  Commonality  of  interests  allows  for  the  harmonization  of  key  government \ndevelopment objectives with the social welfare objectives of rural households. \n \n6.  The following are the main elements of the strategy and represent a synthesis of the \nlessons learned from a review of past efforts to control land degradation. \n \na.  Policies \n \n7.  This element entails the formulation of state, provincial, and local government policy \nframeworks  for  sustainable  land  management.  This  requires  harmonization  of  the  related \nelements within the different policies and strategies guiding the sector development concerns of \nindividual government institutions. Ecological sustainability is a key requirement. Policies aimed \nat increased production of crops, livestock, and forest products should not conflict with the \nmedium- to long-term goal of restoring, sustaining, and enhancing the productive potential of \nnatural  resources.  Important  aspects  are  (i) addressing  the  link  between  poverty  and  land \ndegradation and (ii) greater government budget commitment. \n \n                                                 \n2\n MWR, by itself, cannot achieve an integrated approach by all relevant agencies. However, by adopting the new \nstrategy it can demonstrate its value to the other agencies. As illustrated in para. 6 and footnote 7, main text, a \nstart has also been made in improving interagency coordination. The steering committee for the PRC-GEF OP12 \nPartnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems (that coordinates 11 key agencies in this area) will also \nbe kept informed. \n \n ", " 10 Appendix 2 \nb.  Legislation \n \n8.  This involves reforming and strengthening the water and soil conservation legislative \nregime, within the overall environmental law and policy system of the PRC by updating and \nreformulating  the  1991  Water  and  Soil  Conservation  Law.  Other  recommendations  are  to \n(i) reduce  overlaps  and  maximize  synergies  within  the  body  of  environmental  legislation; \n(ii) consider  longer-term  substantial  legislative  reform,  with  the  aim  of  overcoming  existing \nweaknesses in the provisions and implementing regulations of individual environmental laws \n(covering agriculture, forestry, environmental protection, grasslands, and desertification). \n \nc.  Institutions \n \n9.  Interagency  coordination  is  essential  as  the  control  of  land  degradation  and  the \npromotion of sustainable land management are multidimensional. There is a need for a high-\nlevel  coordinating  body  with  a  mandate  to:  (i) coordinate  the  various  sectors,  (ii) develop \nmedium- to long-term strategies and action plans, (iii) prioritize financial resource allocations, \n(iv) approve guidelines and policies for controlling land degradation and promoting sustainable \nland management, and (v) review the local area development plans proposed by various levels \nof government. Other important issues are (i) devolution of primary responsibility for sustainable \nland management projects and programs to the provincial and county levels; (ii) institutional \ncapacity  building  to  generate  a  cadre  of  planners,  extension  workers,  and  researchers; \n(iii) development of participatory approaches and sensitization of policy makers and senior \nofficials  at  all  levels  to  the  benefits  of  using  participatory  methods  and  processes;  and \n(iv) greater attention and financial resources to research the problems inherent in control of land \ndegradation.  \n \nd.  Technologies \n \n10.  The strategy changes the emphasis from looking at land degradation in terms of what is \nhappening to determining why it is happening\u2014instead of focusing on treating the symptoms \nthe need is to identify and tackle the root causes. Sheet, rill and gully erosion, and the scouring \nand deposition of soil by wind are the visible symptoms of other, usually less obvious, land \ndegradation processes. The most important of these are adverse changes in the physical, \nbiological, chemical, and hydrological properties of the soil. Other features are (i) improving on-\nsite crop, soil, and rainwater management as the keys to preventing soil erosion; (ii) ensuring \nthat land use requirements of agricultural or forestry enterprises match the land qualities present \nin the areas where they are undertaken; (iii) promoting integrated plant nutrition management \nsystems; (iv) promoting conservation agriculture/no-till systems, to counter the problems of soil \nerosion, water loss, and organic matter depletion, associated with conventional tillage practices; \n(v) promoting improved natural grassland management systems to sustain and enhance the \nlivestock  production  potential  of  the  natural  grasslands;  (vi) reviewing  and  improving  tree \nplanting practices to ensure that where afforestation is promoted for land degradation control, it \nachieves the intended objective; (vii) ensuring adoption of mitigative control measures within \nurban areas so as to address an increasing problem; and (viii) documenting and disseminating \ninformation on successful technologies, through the systematic collection, review, and storage \nof data in a centrally located, on-line computer-based soil and water conservation information \nsystem. \n \n ", "Appendix 2  11 \ne.  Processes, Approaches, and Methods \n \n11.  Innovation should be encouraged to recognize the role that innovative farmers can play \nin developing and refining sustainable land management practices. Promotion of sustainable \nland management will support locally appropriate combinations of the following: \n \n(i)  buildup of soil organic matter and related biological activity to sustainable levels; \n(ii)  integrated plant nutrition management with locally appropriate, and cost-effective, \ncombinations of organic/inorganic and on/off-farm sources of plant nutrients; \n(iii)  better crop management, especially (i) use of improved seeds, (ii) improved crop \nestablishment for annual crops and mulching/maintenance of surface cover in \nperennial crops, and (iii) weed management and integrated pest management; \n(iv)  better rainwater management to increase infiltration and reduce runoff so as to \nimprove soil moisture conditions within the rooting zone; \n(v)  improved  protection  against  wind  erosion  by  maintaining  soil  moisture,  and \nincreasing soil surface roughness; \n(vi)  improvement  of  soil  rooting  depth  and  permeability  through  breaking  of \ncultivation-induced compacted soil layers through conservation tillage practices; \n(vii)  reclamation, where appropriate (i.e., if technically feasible and cost effective) of \nland that has been severely degraded; \n(viii)  promotion of community-based participatory approaches, for project planning and \ntechnology development,  so  as  to  build on  rural  peoples  inherent skills  and \ncapability  to  formulate  and  implement  their  own  development  plans,  and  to \ndevelop and disseminate their own improved land management technologies; \n(ix)  development  and  adoption  of  people-centered  learning  processes,  such  as \nfarmer field schools for \u201cfarmer-to-farmer\u201d training and information exchange on \nimproved land management practices; and \n(x)  a focus on sustainable (natural resource-based) livelihoods\u2014not just soil and \nwater conservation\u2014so as to break the cycle of poverty and land degradation. \n \nf.  Costs and Benefits \n \n12.  Potential alternative forms of intervention will be analyzed to determine (i) on-site costs \nand benefits of controlling land degradation, in particular at the farm household, community, and \nsmall-watershed levels; (ii) the off-site costs and benefits, in particular at the community, small-\nwatershed, and river-basin levels. For social equity reasons it is important to (i) consider who \nincurs the costs of controlling land degradation, and whether they are the ones who benefit; and \n(ii) identify improved land management practices with high productive benefits, low incremental \ncosts, minimal forgone benefits, and low risk.  \n \ng.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n13.  Monitoring and evaluation systems will support decision making for ongoing planning \nand  management  of  land  degradation  control  programs.  Coordination  and  sharing  of  the \ncollection and analysis of information between stakeholder institutions is also required to obtain \na consistent and broad picture of the true nature, extent, and severity of land degradation. From \nagreed baseline data, selected key monitoring and evaluation indicators will be developed for \nmeasuring the success of sustainable land management projects with regard to the health of the \nland (ecological impact), and improvements in the socioeconomic circumstances of the intended \nbeneficiaries (poverty impact).  \n \n ", " 12 Appendix 2 \nh.  Funding \n \n14.  The  following  sources  of  funding  will  be  pursued  during  the  implementation  of  the \nstrategy: \n \n(i)  Encouragement of private investment from those engaged in farming, forestry, or \nother  land  use  enterprises  in  the  expectation  that  by  investing  their  own \nresources  of  skill,  land,  labor  and  cash,  they  would  gain  tangible  financial \nbenefits  from  investing  in  improved  production-oriented  (but  conservation-\neffective) field-level farm and/or forest management practices.  \n(ii)  Promotion of conservation for business. Improved land management needs to do \nmore than just rehabilitate the environment; it must also enable the land users to \nmake more profit on a sustainable basis.  \n(iii)  Development  of  local  savings  and  credit  schemes,  as  an  alternative  to \ngovernment support, to overcome local cash constraints.  \n(iv)  The  levy  of  fees  on  off-site  (downstream)  beneficiaries,  to  pay  for  on-site \n(upstream) conservation, where it is possible to clearly identify the beneficiaries, \nand determine the type of services and benefits received. This requires the \ndevelopment of mechanisms for charging for such benefits (e.g., a levy on water \nuser fees, hydropower bills).  \n(v)  Funding of land degradation control from the development and operation and \nmaintenance costs of major infrastructure development projects, such as roads, \nrailways, dams, water transmission canals, irrigation facilities, hydropower plants, \noil and gas pipelines, and urban water supply projects, as their long-term viability \nmay be threatened by erosion, sedimentation, flooding, or burial by drifting sand \nor landslides.  \n(vi)  Creation of central, river-basin, and provincial trust funds, using the money raised \nfrom the imposition of levies on the off-site/downstream beneficiaries, to support \nthe  planning  and  implementation  of  land  degradation  control  programs.  This \nwould be part of the public contribution to the costs of upstream conservation. \n \nC.  Immediate Priorities \n \n15.  Selected priority actions, as included in the strategy, will be assisted by the TA. These \ninclude (i) reformulation of the 1991 Water and Soil Conservation Law, (ii) determination of a \nmethodology to estimate the costs and benefits of interventions to combat land degradation, \n(iii) promotion of the new strategy, and (iv) identification of new investment projects suitable for \ndevelopment partner financing. \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  13 \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($) \n                    \n        Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.
