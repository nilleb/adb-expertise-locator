INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2002 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the \nGovernment  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  confirmed  its  request  for  a  technical \nassistance (TA) to prepare an integrated roads development project (the Project) in Guangxi \nZhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR). ADB\u2019s  Fact-Finding Mission visited the project area in \nAugust  2002,  carried  out  an  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  (IPSA),  and  discussed \neconomic,  social,  and  other  project-specific  issues  with  officials  of  the  central  and  local \ngovernments. This report is based on the understandings reached on the objectives, scope, costs, \nconsultants\u2019 term of reference, and implementation arrangements for the TA, and the Mission\u2019s \nobservations in the field. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2002 program for the PRC1, and an ensuing \nloan is included in the 2004 program. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC's rapid economic growth during the last decade has substantially increased the \ndemand for transport services. The changing structure and increasing sophistication of the economy \nhave altered the pattern of transport demand, with more rapid growth in the demand for road \ntransport  than  for  other  modes.  While  the  development  of  road  infrastructure  is  required  to \ninterconnect all growth-generating sectors, especially the agriculture-based ones, it is also required \nto achieve a better and wider distribution of the benefits of economic growth. Good roads that link the \nrural population to the main economy are a prerequisite for rural development and poverty reduction \nthrough increased agriculture output, increased incomes, and better living conditions. \n \n3.  The PRC road network had about 1.76 million kilometers (km) of roads at the end of 2002, \nincluding  the  second  longest  expressway  in  the  world.  However,  the  network  is  still \nunderdeveloped in quality and extent, and the road density is among the lowest in the world  \n(17.7 km per 100 square kilometers [km2]). The PRC faces constraints and bottlenecks in road \ntransport. Road networks are poorly developed and do not provide access to large parts of the \ncountry, particularly in the poorer inland regions. Vehicle numbers are growing at 2\u20133 times the \nrate of population, and the urban population has increased from 190 million in 1980 to 360 million \nin 2001. By 2010, an estimated 700 million people will live in major activity centers. The vehicle \nand population growth, needed for an efficient road network, together with the considerable \nvolume of slow-moving nonmotorized vehicles, contribute to numerous road accidents, hamper \ntraffic flow and generate congestion, and inhibit socioeconomic development. In 2001, there were \nabout 755,000 road accidents, killing 106,000 and injuring 546,000 persons in the PRC. This cost \n1\u20133% of gross domestic product (GDP), and entailed 1 road accident death every 5 minutes. \n \n4.  The Government views road development as a key component of its strategy to improve \naccess to activity centers and support socioeconomic development. An ADB-financed study in the \nsouthwest region2 concluded that poor quality road infrastructure and inadequate transport services \nin poor areas are major obstacles to economic growth and poverty reduction. \n \n5.  The western development strategy (WDS) adopted by the Government in February 2000 \naims to accelerate development in the western region.3 The Government views road development as \na key component of the WDS to improve access to markets and social services, facilitate economic \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 13 May 2002. \n2  ADB. 1998.  Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of China for Regional Road Sector Study. Manila.           \nThe study covered Chongqing Municipality; Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region; and Guizhou, Sichuan, and \nYunnan provinces. \n3  Consisting of the following 12 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipality: Chongqing, Gansu, Guangxi, \nGuizhou, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Xizang, and Yunnan. The three prefectures \nincluded in the Western Development strategy are in Hubei, Hunan, and Jilin. ", "2 \ngrowth,  and  reduce  poverty.  The  Government's  policies  for  the  road  sector  are  based  on \n(i) constructing expressways to expand the national trunk highway system (NTHS) and link all cities \nwith a population of more than 500,000; (ii) developing secondary roads, particularly those that will \nhelp reduce poverty in the rural areas; and (iii) building roads that will support regional cooperation \nwith neighboring countries in the southwest, northeast, and northwest. The NTHS is the heart of the \nroad network, a system of interprovincial expressways and highways of about 35,000 km. It will be \ncomplemented by the development of national, provincial, county, township, and village roads. \nMost of the remaining NTHS sections will be completed together with 195,000 km of interprovincial \nhighways and 150,000 km of rural roads during the Tenth Five-Year Plan (10FYP, 2001-2005).4 \n \n6.  The link between transport development and poverty reduction is generally recognized.5    \nThe greater the road development, the higher the per capita income.6 The Government has been \nsupporting poverty reduction through road sector investments in several ways. First, the focus on \nNTHS construction has shifted from the east coast to the central and southwest regions, which have \na higher incidence of poverty, and where road density is about 10.5 km/100 km2 compared with \n35 km in the east. Second, the vehicle purchase fee, which has financed about 13% of road sector \nexpenditures,  has  been  allocated  largely  to  financing  road  investments  in  poorer  provinces.       \nThird, Ministry of Communications grants and provincial communications department resources \nsupplement local government budgets to improve county and township roads. Fourth, through the \nseparate  budgeting  of  poverty  reduction  funds,  road  improvements  are  carried  out  to  link  an \nincreasing number of villages to the road network, with corresponding improvement in the quality of \ntransport services. For the road sector, the WDS will (i) facilitate economic and social development in \nthe western region, (ii) link the western region with the central and eastern regions, (iii) provide the \nwestern region with trade outlets at the southern and eastern seaports, and (iv) promote regional \ncooperation  with  neighboring  countries.  The  Government\u2019s  measures  and  road  development \nobjectives will contribute significantly to poverty reduction in the western region. \n \n7.  ADB and the Government have had extensive discussions on how to maximize the poverty \nreduction impact of road investments. The location of ADB-financed road projects has shifted from \nthe northeast and coastal areas to the poorer central and southwest regions. The shift to poorer \ninterior provinces will be sustained during the 10FYP. To enhance poverty impact, the scope of \nrecent road projects has been broadened to integrate local roads with expressways, thus providing \nbetter access to poor counties and townships. \n \n8.  GZAR, which is one of the PRC's five autonomous regions, in the southwest part of the \ncountry; covers 236,600 km2; and is bordered by Yunnan on the west, Guizhou on the north, \nHunan on the northeast, and Guangdong on the east, the Beibu Gulf on the south, and Viet Nam \non  the  southwest.  The  population  of  GZAR  was  over  48  million  at  the  end  of  2001.  \nGreater  Nanning  is  the  capital,  with  a  population  of  around  3  million.  GZAR  is  a  minority \nautonomous administrative region with 12 ethnic groups. The administration of GZAR comprises  \n2 prefectures, 12 prefecture cities, 10 county cities, 59 counties, and 12 minority autonomous \ncounties.  The  region's  leading  commercial  crop  is  sugarcane.  It  also  produces  fruits,  pigs, \nchickens, ducks, and goats. Fishing and aquaculture is extensive. GZAR is a major producer of \ntimber and forest products. It has sufficient coal, bauxite, and iron deposits to support moderate \nindustrial  development.  Industries  include  iron,  aluminum,  steel,  machinery,  cement,  textiles, \npaper, flour, and silk. GZAR's GDP was CNY223.1 billion in 2001, compared with the national \nfigure of CNY9,434.4 billion. The GDP per capita for GZAR was CNY4,697 in 2001, which was \n                                                 \n4  ADB assisted the Government in identifying road sector investment and policy reforms in the southwestern PRC \nthrough TA 3086-PRC (footnote 2). \n5  ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of China for Study on Ways to Support Rural Poverty \nReduction Projects. Manila. Also, Fan, S., Zhang, L., and Zhang, X. 2000. Growth, Inequality, and Poverty in Rural \nChina: The Role of Public Investments. Washington, DC: International Food Policy Research Institute. \n6  ADB. 2002. Road Sector Impact Study: Beijing-Tongjiang Exressway Route in the People's Republic of China. Manila. ", "    3 \nbelow the national average of CNY7,543. GZAR is a poor coastal region and is included under the \nWDS.  In  2001,  GZAR\u2019s  GDP  per  capita  ranked  29  among  the  PRC's  31  provinces  and \nautonomous regions. Lack of transport infrastructure is one of the factors contributing to the \ndepressed economic conditions. \n \n9.  At the end of 2001, GZAR had about 3,120 km of railways, 53,000 km of roads, and  \n5,620 km of navigable inland waterways. From 1990 to 2001, domestic passenger transport in all \nmodes grew by 10.3% per annum in passenger-km and freight transport grew at 6.1% per annum \nin ton-km. Road traffic grew at 13.1% per annum for passengers and 6.0% per annum for freight. \nIn 2001, road traffic accounted for over 75% of total passenger-km, followed by railways with \n24.6% and coastal and inland waterways with 0.5%. The modal split for freight by ton-km was \nrailways 62.9%, roads 27.2%, and inland waterways 9.9%. Since 1990, the railway share of \npassenger traffic has declined by 13.6%, and the road share has increased by 17.0%. \n \n10.  The  primary  target  of  road  development  for  the  10FYP  (2000\u20132005)  in  GZAR  is  to \ncomplete construction of expressways on the NTHS and its branch highways that connect to the \nmajor ports and surrounding provinces. The secondary target is to accelerate development of \ncounty and township roads to assist the poverty areas. By the end of 2005, 7,000 km of new roads \nare to be constructed, to increase the length of the network to 60,000 km. \n \n11.  The existing two-lane 250 km Nanning-Baise road (NH24) is the only road linking Nanning \nand Baise prefectures. This road serves agricultural and forest lands, and residential areas. \nThe  technical  standards  of  NH24  are  low\u2014it  has  many  sharp  curves  and  poor  pavement \nconditions. Passing sight distance is poor over much of the road\u2019s length. NH24 has exceeded its \ncapacity, which is an average traffic of 10,000 vehicles daily. Traffic includes trucks, buses, \nmotorcycles,  three-wheeled  vehicles,  passenger  cars,  tractors,  bicycles,  and  nonmotorized \nvehicles. Conflict of traffic with pedestrian and animal movements, vehicle parking, and farmer\u2019s \nactivities on NH24 has exacerbated the situation. A passenger car takes about 5 hours, and trucks \ntake longer, to cover the 250 km between Nanning and Baise. NH24\u2013related accidents represent \n65% of the total accidents in Baise City and 71.5% in Tiandong County only. Traffic on NH24 is \nforecast to reach an average of 14,000\u201316,000 vehicles per day in 2005, which will cripple the \nroad from 2005 onward, and will significantly inhibit the socioeconomic growth of GZAR. A new \nroad following a new alignment therefore must be constructed to accommodate the expected traffic \ndemand and support the economic development of the region. \n \n12.  The proposed Project, construction of the Nanning-Baise road, will comprise a 188.6 km \nexpressway, starting at Tanluo town in Nanning Prefecture and connecting Nanning to the Tanluo \nexpressway (35 km); passing through Long\u2019an, Pingguo, Tiandong, and Tiandeng counties; and \nending at Baise City. The Project will provide access to major economic zones as well as poor \ncounty and township centers in the project influence area, to distribute the anticipated project \nbenefits. The project alignment was selected to minimize adverse impacts. \n \n13.  The Government has developed a 5 year plan to upgrade the road networks in the project \narea. The scope of the proposed Project will be expanded to include local road improvement to \nenhance the access of poor communities and maximize the distribution of socioeconomic benefits \nin the project area. The TA will include determining the scope of the local road improvement. \nThe Project will be a key connector linking surrounding provinces, and is an important part of the \nNTHS. The Project will provide a convenient, or the only, passageway for the western region to \naccess the seaports in GZAR; Hong Kong, China; and Macao Special Autonomous Region, \nparticularly to the ADB-financed Fangcheng Port in GZAR\u2014one of the hub PRC ports, completed ", "4 \nin 2001.7 The Project also will facilitate regional cooperation between the PRC, Viet Nam, and \nother countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion; and will facilitate overseas trade. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s Fact-Finding Mission classified the project influence area into three categories. \n(i) The direct project influence area (DPIA)8 includes a total population of 1.866 million. The DPIA \nhas a high prevalence of minority people,9 and 25\u201345% of its population are poor.10 Of the 788 \nvillages in the DPIA, 413 are classified as \"poverty villages\" and have 687,000 people, or 37% of \nthe total population. (ii) The areawide project influence area (APIA) covers nearly 5 million people \nin Baise and Nanning prefectures, among which 25% are poor.11 Thus, the APIA beneficiaries will \ninclude about 75% of the poor in GZAR. In addition, the Government has increased investment in \nthe Pingguo County Aluminum Company, which is in the APIA and depends heavily on the \navailability of efficient transport. The plant is being increased to twice its capacity with foreign \ninvestment. It employs 6,300 workers. The APIA also has five tourist attractions, and hydropower \nprojects.  (iii)  The  indirect  project  influence  area  includes  all  interprovincial  and  regional \nbeneficiaries. \n \n15.  The Project preparatory work by the Government is already underway. The English version \nof the project feasibility study, prepared by the Guangxi Design Institute, was submitted to ADB in \nMarch 2003. The final endorsement of the feasibility study by the State Development Reform \nCommission  is  expected  in  November  2003  and  the  preliminary  engineering  design  will  be \ncompleted in September 2003 as per Ministry of Communications standards. The environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  is  scheduled  to  be  completed  in  October  2003,  while  the  draft \nresettlement plan are scheduled to be completed in May 2003. The IPSA and rapid environmental \nassessment carried out during fact-finding helped identify the social and environmental issues that \nwill need to be addressed during the preparation of the Project, and reviewed the need for a \ncomprehensive assessment of the social context in line with ADB policies and guidelines on social \ndimensions.  The  rapid  environmental  assessment  concluded  that  the  Project  should  be  an \nenvironment category A project  (Appendix 2), while the IPSA has designated the project as a \npoverty intervention (Appendix 2). The IPSA concluded that key social issues to be analyzed \nfurther during project preparation are resettlement and project impacts on poor and minority \npeople. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n16.  The TA will help the Government prepare an integrated roads development project to \nsupport pro-poor economic growth and reduce poverty in GZAR. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  The  TA  will  assist  the  Guangxi  Communications  Department  (GCD)  to  (i)  refine  the \nfeasibility study, including the EIA and summary EIA, resettlement plan, and poverty impact \nanalysis for the proposed Project, in conformity with ADB\u2019s requirements; (ii) broaden the scope to \n                                                 \n7  PRC: 1427: Fangcheng Port, June 1997. \n8\n The DPIA includes three counties in Baise Prefecture, Baise City, and one county in Nanning Prefecture. It includes a \ncorridor of about 80 km from the proposed project expressway. \n9 There are 7 minority nationalities in Baise Prefecture, who constitute about 87% of Baise\u2019s population (3,650,000). \nMore than 200,000 people still face serious lack of food and clothing. Baise's frontier border with Viet Nam is 361 km. \n10 A \"poverty village\" has an average per capita net income below CNY1,052; more than 70% of its people below the \npoverty line, or areas facing the worst natural and poor living conditions. \n11 The APIA covers all Baise and about 30% of Nanning prefectures. \n ", "    5 \nmake it more pro-poor by integrating a local road component into the Project; (iii) identify socio-\neconomic indicators and the monitoring mechanisms; (iv) confirm the technical, economic, and \nfinancial viability of the proposed investments; (v) review and update transport and road profiles; \nand (vi) provide the basis for further policy dialogue in such areas as the poverty impact of road \nprojects,  vehicle  emissions,  nongovernment  financing,  expressway  corporatization  and \ncommercialization, road safety, asset management, and pricing policies for road users. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $650,000 equivalent, comprising $371,700 of \nforeign exchange cost and $278,300 equivalent of local currency cost. ADB will provide $500,000 \nequivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and a portion of the local currency cost \namounting to $128,300 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding \nprogram.  GCD  will  finance  the  remaining  $150,000  equivalent  to  cover  the  costs  of  office \naccommodation and support services, communications, local transport, office supply, and other \nfacilities and services required for the implementation of the TA. The detailed cost estimate is in \nAppendix 3. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  A team of international consulting firms in association with domestic consulting firm(s) will \nbe engaged using the simplified technical proposal procedures based on the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants.  \nThe TA will require a total of 24 person-months of consulting services, including 12 person-months \nof international and 12 person-months of domestic consultancy, to carry out the study as defined in \nthe outline terms of reference (Appendix 4). The international consultants will provide expertise in  \n(i) highway and traffic engineering, (ii) bridge and tunnel design and construction, (iii) transport \neconomics, (iv) expressway finance and operations, (v) resettlement planning, (vi) poverty and \nsocial analysis, and (vii) environmental aspects. The domestic consultants will have expertise in  \n(i)  highway  and  structure  engineering,  (ii)  transport  economics  and  financial  analysis,  \n(iii) environment protection and conservation, and (iv) social development and poverty reduction. \n \n20.  GCD will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will be responsible for supervision and \nmonitoring  of  TA  activities,  and  liaison  with  government  agencies  and  organizations. \nThe consultants are scheduled to be fielded in October 2003, and the consulting services will be \ncarried out over a 5 month period, with the TA due to be completed at the end of February 2004. \nGCD will provide ADB and the consultants with the feasibility study; engineering studies; EIA; \nresettlement  plan;  and  any  other  materials,  recent  studies,  and  reports  required  for  the \nimplementation of the TA. The consultants will maintain close relationships with the Government \nand  GCD,  and  inform  them  of  progress  and  findings.  A  tripartite  meeting  involving  the \nGovernment, ADB staff, and the consultants will be held in the PRC to provide advice and \nguidance to the consultants and review their reports. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government of \nthe People\u2019s Republic of  China for  preparing the Guangxi Roads Development II Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.
