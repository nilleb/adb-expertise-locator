I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed (i) \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India for the Rajasthan Renewable Energy Transmission \nInvestment Program,1 (ii) administration of loans to be provided from the ADB Clean Technology \nFund (CTF) to India for the Rajasthan Renewable Energy Transmission Investment Program, \nand (iii) administration of a technical assistance (TA) grant to be provided from the ADB CTF for \nRajasthan Renewable Energy Capacity Development and Implementation Support.2  \n \n2.  At the end of 2011, the state of Rajasthan in India had installed renewable energy \ncapacity of about 1,767 megawatts (MW) of wind generation and 45 MW of solar generation, all \nof which was transmitted using the existing transmission grid. The state\u2019s renewable energy \ninvestment plan aims for a total of about 8,000 MW of solar and wind generation capacity by \n2018\u2014largely private sector.3 These include private solar and wind power projects planned \nprimarily for the renewable energy resource-rich districts of western Rajasthan in Jodhpur, \nBikaner, Barmer, and Jaisalmer. One such project is a solar power generation park being \ndeveloped in Bhadla by the Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corporation, the state nodal agency \nfor  renewable  energy.  The  proposed  investment  program  will  support  the  development  of \nfacilities to transmit renewable energy from western Rajasthan to the state and national grids.4  \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.   Background. India has an annual electricity deficit of 8%, and nearly 350 million of its \npeople  have  no  access  to  electricity. The  country  is  increasingly  dependent  on fossil fuel \nimports of coal and gas to generate electricity.5 In its Integrated Energy Policy 2006,6 the \ngovernment estimated that India needed to alter its energy source mix and increase electricity \ngeneration fivefold by 2032 to meet projected demand. Due to its tropical location, some regions \nin India benefit from solar irradiation ranging from 4\u20137 kilowatt-hours per square meter of area. \nThe  solar  irradiation  available  in  the  western  regions,  particularly  in  the  desert  regions of \nRajasthan, is at the higher end of this spectrum. India also has significant wind potential in its \nwestern region. These advantages have led to India\u2019s decision to invest in renewable energy \nparticularly in the state of Rajasthan.  \n \n4.   Policy framework and institutional arrangements. The federal and state governments \nhave  sound  policy frameworks  and  strategies for  developing  renewable  energy,  which  the \nIntegrated Energy Policy sees as a way to meet India\u2019s two goals of improving energy security \nand expanding the use of clean energy to meet fast-rising electricity demand. Solar energy \ndevelopment is an important part of the government\u2019s 2008 National Action Plan for Climate \nChange, and the government launched the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM) \nin 2010 to create an enabling framework to deploy 20,000 MW of solar power generation \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Financed by the Clean Technology Fund. The CTF is a $5.2 billion fund providing middle-income countries with \nresources to scale up demonstration, deployment and transfer of low-carbon clean technologies. India\u2019s CTF \ninvestment plan was endorsed in November 2011 by the CTF trust fund committee. CTF financing approvals for \nthe investment program were received on 29 July 2013.   \n3  This capacity is expected to be developed by the private sector to supply to utilities within and outside Rajasthan.  \n4  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2011. Technical \nAssistance to India for Preparing the Rajasthan Renewable Energy Program. Manila.  \n5   The country currently imports 15%\u201320% of the coal used to generate its electricity.  \n6   Government of India. Planning Commission. 2006. Integrated Energy Policy. New Delhi. ", "2                       \ncapacity across India by 2022. The government of Rajasthan has followed suit with its own \nframework through adoption of a solar policy in 2011 and a wind policy in 2012. These policies \nemphasize  private  and  public  sector  investments,  including  partnerships,  to  shorten  the \ndevelopment timeline, reduce development costs, facilitate replication and address scale up \nissues encountered with a stand-alone project approach. The Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory \nCommission has set renewable energy procurement obligations for the distribution utilities in the \nstate and is regulating the workings of the electricity transmission and distribution companies.7  \n \n5.  Road map. India\u2019s Ministry of New and Renewable Energy aims to add nearly 30,000 \nMW of wind power and 10,000 MW of solar power capacity over 2012\u20132018 in renewable \nenergy rich states including Rajasthan. Nearly 1,000 MW of solar power capacity has been \nawarded under phase 1 of the JNNSM, and this is expected to significantly rise under phase 2 \nof  the  JNNSM  that  will  be  implemented  starting  2013.8 For  Rajasthan,  the  total  installed \nrenewable energy capacity of wind and solar is expected to reach 8000 MW by 2018. In \nRajasthan, the state\u2019s renewable energy investment plan includes establishment of renewable \nenergy  parks,  solar  and  wind  generation  projects,  transmission  and  smart  grid  facilities, \nassociated infrastructure, and community power schemes. The renewable energy park model \nconceives replicable private sector projects being set up at a single location to generate and sell \nrenewable energy. Rajasthan\u2019s use of the park model is expected to accelerate investment in \nrenewable energy generation because the government will provide the infrastructure including \ntransmission facilities for electricity for plant construction, roads, site development, and security. \nIt will also facilitate permits and allocate land. Development of privately owned generation \nprojects  would  be financed  by financial  institutions  such  as  the  Indian  Renewable  Energy \nDevelopment  Agency.  The  park  model  marks  a  departure  from  traditional  approaches  to \ndeveloping renewable energy projects and achieves greater economies of scale. \n \n6.  The state government has mandated Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut Prasaran Nigam Limited \n(RRVPNL), the public sector electrical transmission licensee in Rajasthan, to transmit the power \nproduced from wind and solar renewable energy projects in the state. In addition to private solar \nphotovoltaic projects, the solar park in Bhadla will also host concentrated solar thermal projects. \nThe state government\u2019s overall investment plan for renewable energy development amounts to \nmore  than  $11  billion  during  2012\u20132018.  About  $9.5  billion  of  this  amount  would  be  for \nrenewable energy power generation mainly from the private sector, while more than $1.6 billion \nwould be invested in transmission and financed from various sources, including ADB\u2019s proposed \ninvestment program.9  \n \n7.  The policy framework, road map, and investment program for renewable energy in the \ncountry and the state of Rajasthan are fully consistent with ADB\u2019s strategy for the energy sector \nand ADB\u2019s draft country partnership strategy for India for 2013\u20132017, which supports renewable \nenergy development, expanded transmission systems, and institutional strengthening.  \n \n8.  Multitranche financing facility. In May 2010, ADB announced the Asia Solar Energy \nInitiative  to  catalyze  3,000  MW  in  solar  energy  projects  through  innovative  public\u2013private \npartnerships. ADB\u2019s operations departments have been active through public and private sector \nsupport in this strategic space for some time. ADB\u2019s private sector operations have financed \n                                                \n7  The utilities in Rajasthan are required to procure 5.7% of their overall power needs from wind power projects and \n1.0% from solar power projects during 2013\u20132014. \n8  More than 800 MW of capacity awarded under phase 1 of the JNNSM is in Rajasthan and in advance stages of \nconstruction. \n9  ADB estimates based on government plans for 5,700 MW of renewable energy capacity addition by 2018 (para 5).  \n ", "                  3 \nstand-alone solar power projects across India, including projects in Rajasthan.10 ADB support \nfor the public sector activities has been provided mainly through financing for transmission \nfacilities. This included support for the transmission infrastructure for solar parks in the state of \nGujarat in 2010. The pipeline of renewable energy projects is strong and growing. \n  \n9.  The  Government  of  India  and  Rajasthan  requested  support  from  ADB  for  the \ndevelopment of renewable energy projects in Rajasthan, including in its planned solar parks, as \nwell  as  financing through  an  MFF  to  set  up  transmission  and  associated  infrastructure to \nmanage integration of renewable energy. The preconditions for the use of the MFF are all in \nplace\u2014a road map and strategy, a policy framework, investment and financing plans, and \nreliable  safeguard  arrangements.  The  MFF  is  the  modality  most  suited  to  a  long-term \npartnership in these activities, given the phased nature of investments in electricity generation \nand the need for flexibility in project design and implementation. It is also possibly the best way \nto provide continuity when trying to combine investments in physical and nonphysical aspects of \nrenewable energy development. An MFF allows the Rajasthan government and ADB to spend \nmore time on implementation work.   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  impact  will  be  the  accelerated  development  of  renewable  energy  sources  in \nRajasthan and India. The outcome will be the achievement of a cleaner electricity mix and a \nmore efficient and effective generation and transmission system in Rajasthan.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  Physical outputs will include the construction of the bulk power transmission system in \nwestern Rajasthan. The bulk power transmission system include the construction of three grid \nsubstations (400 kilovolt [kV]) and nine grid substations (220 kV) and associated facilities; \naugmentation  of  four  400  kV  grid  substations  and  three  132  kV  substations;  and  the \nconstruction of about 1852 kilometers of 400 kV, 220 kV, and 132 kV of transmission lines \nprimarily in western Rajasthan. Nonphysical outputs include developing institutional capacity for \nrenewable energy parks and transmission systems (see also para. 17).  \n \n12.  Project 1 will include physical and nonphysical investments. Physical investments will be \nfor construction of the bulk power transmission system in western Rajasthan, including: two 400 \nkV grid substations and associated facilities in Bhadla and Ramgarh; two 220 kV substations \nand associated facilities at Bap and Kanasar; augmentation of two 400 kV grid substations at \nAkal and Bikaner; upgrade of three substations to 132 kV in Bhadla; and construction of almost \n600 kilometers of 400 kV, 220 kV, and 132 kV transmission lines in Bhadla and Ramgarh. The \nnonphysical outputs comprise project management and capacity building. Project 1 will finance \nthe  costs to  prepare future  MFF  investments and  supervise  the first generation  of  capital \ninvestments.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n13.  Private sector led investment under Rajasthan\u2019s renewable energy investment plan will \nbe supported by public sector transmission network investment under the investment program. \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2011.

A commitment charge of 0.15% is applied to the undisbursed balance of the OCR loan. For the \nADB CTF loan, a management fee of 0.18% on the undrawn balance and fixed interest rate of 0.25% are applied. \n   Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n14.  The government requested an MFF in an amount up to $498 million loan and $2 million \ngrant from ADB to finance the investment program. The financing plan (table 2) includes $300 \nmillion from ADB ordinary capital resources (OCR), $198 million loan and $2 million grant from \nthe ADB CTF,11 to be administered by ADB. The MFF will be drawn down in three tranches, \nsubject  to  the  submission  of  periodic  financing  requests,  execution  of  loan  and  project \nagreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set forth \nin the framework financing agreement. The first tranche amounts to $150 million\u2014$62 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s OCR and $88 million from the ADB CTF. Financing from ADB\u2019s OCR will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years, a straight-line repayment method, an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on these loan terms and the \nrepayment method, the average loan maturity is 15.25 years, and the maturity premium payable \nto ADB is 0.10% per annum. The ADB CTF loan financing comes with a 40-year term, including \na grace period of 10 years, an annual interest rate of 0.25%, a management fee of 0.18% per \nyear, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nThe remaining financing will be mobilized by RRVPNL, including debt from lenders and equity \nsupport  from  the  government  of  Rajasthan.

Implementation Arrangements \n15.   RRVPNL, the state transmission licensee in Rajasthan, and the Energy Department of \nRajasthan will be the executing agencies for the investment program. Rajasthan Renewable \nEnergy Corporation (RREC), the state government nodal agency responsible for developing \nrenewable energy will coordinate with the state government to provide the necessary land for \npower project developers. RRVPNL has the capacity to execute and monitor the implementation \nof the investment program-financed transmission projects. This capacity is underpinned by the \nestablishment of a dedicated project management unit at RRVPNL since 2012 for design, \nsupervision, and procurement. Project implementation will be handled by RRVPNL\u2019s regional \noffice  in  Jodhpur,  Rajasthan.  Private  sector  investment  proposals  and  the  related  bidding \nprocess will be handled by a committee of secretaries from the government, supported by \nRREC.  Project  management,  preparatory  work  for  future  subprojects,  and  implementation \nsupport will be financed by the Rajasthan government. \n \n16.  Procurement. Goods, equipment, and civil works financed by ADB will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nRRVPNL has undertaken advance procurement actions, including the placement of bidding \ndocuments in the market and requested that ADB authorize these actions and allow retroactive \nfinancing.  RRVPNL will follow competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB for public \nsector transmission investments. Private sector renewable energy developers selling power to \nutilities will be selected through a competitive process and will enter into supply contracts with \ntheir clients.12 The construction of their facilities will most likely follow turnkey contracts selected \nthrough  a  competitive  process.  RREC  will  coordinate  with  RRVPNL  on  the  choice  and \nsequencing  of  the  development  of  transmission  lines  to  evacuate  the  renewable  energy \nproduced  in  the  region,  including  that  from  wind  and  solar  parks.  The  implementation \narrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the facility administration \nmanual.13 Retroactive financing will be allowed for up to 20% of the individual loan amount for \nexpenditures incurred 12 months prior to loan signing. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n12 Private sector bidding began for phase 1 of the Bhadla solar park in 2013 under the Rajasthan solar policy.

Several  technical  studies  on  the  renewable  energy  roll  out  plan  and  transmission \nevacuation requirements were prepared by RRVPNL and reviewed by the Central Electricity \nAuthority  and  Ministry  of  New  and  Renewable  Energy.  The  work  focused  on  technology \naspects, the nature and characteristics of the investment plans, and the most appropriate \n                                                \n14 Financed by the Clean Technology Fund. \n15 Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Based on the results of studies \nundertaken under the TA, additional support could be considered in subsequent tranches of the MFF. \n16 Climate change adaptation report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "                  7 \nelectricity evacuation arrangements and renewable energy integration proposals. ADB followed \nup these assessments with its own and found the technical studies acceptable. TA for the \nCapacity Development of Rajasthan Solar Park provided support to RREC for the studies for the \nestablishment of the first phase of the Bhadla solar park.17 The work undertaken indicated that \nthe sequencing of the generation developments under the investment plan and of transmission \nunder  the  investment  program  is  technically  feasible  and  execution  arrangements  are \nsatisfactory. A road map for renewable energy integration for RRVPNL will be refined under \nproject 1 and implemented under the investment program. Support for the development of the \nmaster plan for the second phase of the Bhadla solar park will commence starting 2013 under \nthe TA associated with project 1.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n20.  The  due  diligence  process  included  an  assessment  of  the  likely  level  of  investor \nparticipation in renewable energy projects in Rajasthan, including in the Bhadla solar park. \nBidding for 1200 MW of wind power will be carried out to meet the requirement of Rajasthan \ndistribution utilities till 2016 under the state wind policy. Under the JNNSM, at least 3,000 MW of \ncapacity is to be competitively bid out by 2017 and a significant slice of which is expected to be \nin Rajasthan.18 Procurement for 75 MW of solar photovoltaic power at Bhadla solar park for \nRajasthan distribution utilities was completed in 2013. 200 MW of solar power capacity is to be \ntendered out annually during 2014\u20132018 at the Bhadla solar park. In addition, private generating \nenterprises  are  setting  up  wind  and  solar  projects  to  supply  power  purchasers  outside \nRajasthan through long-term contracts and renewable energy certificates. Due diligence shows \nthat private sector generation projects are financially viable with demand from private operators \nwith sufficient access to finance in India and elsewhere (footnote 10). The financial analysis for \nthe transmission infrastructure (a prerequisite and integral part of the overall investment plan) \nwas conducted using standard ADB approaches. It was found to be viable, with the financial \ninternal rate of return for project 1 at 2.1% and a weighted average cost of capital of 1.1%.19  \n \n21.  The economic evaluation of the investment program and project 1 compares benefits \nand costs under with- and without-investment scenarios.20 The evaluation found project 1 to be \neconomically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of about 16.4%. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n22.  ADB  conducted  an  assessment  of  RRVPNL\u2019s  governance,  including  its  financial \nmanagement and procurement capacities. The financial management assessment concluded \nthat RRVPNL has the ability to fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements. RRVPNL has a procurement \nunit of more than 40 qualified staff. This team has the capacity and experience to handle \ninternational competitive bidding operations and is familiar with ADB rules and procedures. ADB \nprovided  support  to  RRVPNL  in  the  preparation  of  bidding  documents  for  the  first  set  of \ninvestments, and RRVPNL staff have participated in ADB procurement seminars. RRVPNL has \nset up a project management unit to report on the investment program.  \n \n23.   An empowered committee comprising senior secretaries of the state government has \nbeen set up to finalize clearances of solar and wind power projects. RREC will support this \n                                                \n17  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance for the Rajasthan Solar Park Capacity Development Project . Manila. \n18 Under the JNNSM, 3,000 MW\u20139,000 MW of solar power is expected to be commissioned during 2013\u20132017. \n19  Financial Analysis: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20  Economic Analysis: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8                       \ncommittee and report on the performance of private sector-led investments. RREC will oversee \nthe private generation program and report on it to government authorities and through the \nproject management unit to ADB. \n \n24.   Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB reserves the right to examine and review directly any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, \nor coercive practices relating to the MFF and the projects. To support these efforts, relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time to time) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government,  RRVPNL  and  other  agencies.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the facility administration manual.21  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.   Industry and services constitute more than 60% of Rajasthan\u2019s gross domestic product. \nThe state registered high growth rates of 8.5% during 2007\u20132012. The power sector plays a key \nrole in contributing to economic growth, development, and social well-being. The growth of \nrenewable energy in Rajasthan will directly and indirectly contribute to poverty reduction by \ncreating temporary and permanent jobs and enhancing energy security.  \n \n26.  A socioeconomic and poverty assessment was carried out along the transmission routes \nand in the area of the substations identified for support under project 1, as well as in the vicinity \nof phase 1 of the Bhadla solar park. These areas lack basic infrastructure and other services, \nincluding  access  to  good  quality  water  supply,  medical  facilities,  and  electricity.  Economic \nactivity and growth is weaker than it should be due to a lack of income-generating opportunities, \nthe low skill levels of the local population, and limited access to markets. The investment \nprogram will create economic opportunities. A gender action plan has been prepared for project \n1. The plan includes interventions to support sustainable, socially inclusive development in the \nareas adjacent to renewable energy parks. As part of its responsibilities, RREC has set up a \ncommunity development fund by levying an upfront nominal fee on renewable energy projects \nthat will support social development projects. The TA associated with project 1 will support the \nexecuting  agencies  in  making  the  community  development  fund  operational  and  support \nlivelihood  opportunities.  The  loan  agreement  includes  a  commitment  from  the  executing \nagencies to implement the gender action plan. The TA will enhance the impact of the renewable \nenergy investment plan through effective community development and gender mainstreaming.    \n \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  An environment assessment and review framework, a resettlement framework, and an \nindigenous peoples planning framework were prepared, outlining the environment and social \nsafeguard  principles  and  requirements.22 RRVPNL  will  undertake  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard due diligence on individual investments based on the environment assessment and \nreview framework, resettlement framework, and indigenous peoples planning framework, and \nsubmit  quarterly  reports  on  implementation  of  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs), \nresettlement plans for projects, and if required, indigenous peoples plans.  \n \n \n28.  Project 1 investments are classified as category B for environment. Major components \nproposed include supply and installation of transmission substations and transmission lines. The \nconstruction work is limited to building foundations for the transmission towers and substations. \n                                                \n21  Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 Environment  Assessment  and  Review  Framework;  Resettlement  Framework;  Indigenous  Peoples  Planning \nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "                  9 \nBased on the environmental assessment and surveys conducted by RRVPNL, potential adverse \nenvironmental impacts of this work are minimal and can be mitigated through implementation of \nthe EMP. Budgetary provisions have been made to cover the environmental mitigation and \nmonitoring requirements, and the EMP is part of the bidding documents. RRVPNL will supervise \nthe construction contracts and EMP implementation. The initial environmental examination for \nProject 1 was disclosed on ADB website. \n \n29.  Project  1  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. Social surveys and consultations were undertaken in accordance with \nADB's  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Project  1  will  not  entail  any  permanent  land \nacquisition. The proposed grid substations will be built on government land. The transmission \nlines will have a temporary impact at some locations through disruption of crop cultivation during \nconstruction. This will be also minimal, since the transmission routes are mostly through vacant \nland. Project 1 will not have any social risks or impacts of a permanent or irreversible nature. \nDue diligence was also undertaken for the Bhadla solar park, and the results are included in an \nappendix of the resettlement plan.23 Budgetary provisions have been made to compensate \naffected people for these losses if and when they occur. There are no structures or buildings \naffected, and no physical displacement is foreseen. The loan agreements include a standard \nassurance related to core labor standards for contractors (including equal pay for equal types of \nwork), and an awareness program on HIV/AIDS, and sexually transmitted diseases. Additionally, \nthe social impact assessment provided baseline information for the gender action plan. The \nresettlement plan for Project 1 was disclosed on ADB website. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  The major risks are (i) lack of coordination in the development of renewable energy \ngeneration and transmission, (ii) potential technical problems integrating renewable energy with \nthe transmission network, and (iii) poor financial performance by RRVPNL. Coordination issues \nwill be addressed by a state government committee while the MFF modality provides flexibility \non the transmission investment roll out in subsequent phases. The integration requirements are \naddressed under the renewable energy integration road map under the investment program. \nAssurances regarding the financial sustainability of RRVPNL have been provided. Risks and \nmitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPossible lack of  Empowered committee of government secretaries to coordinate the planning and \ncoordination between  development of generation and transmission systems.  \nthe development of  Central government agencies, including CEA, and the state regulator, to periodically \nrenewable energy  review plans.
