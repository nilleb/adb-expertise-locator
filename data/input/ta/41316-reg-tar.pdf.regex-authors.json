Regional  cooperation  among  the  Central  Asian  republics  (CARs)  is  necessary  to \nmanage natural resources and to optimize sustainable economic growth, two issues that are \nstrongly related in the case of water resources. The Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers dominate \nwater resources in the CARs and are the sources of the Aral Sea. Together they drain nearly \ntwo-thirds of Central Asia.1 Afghanistan contributes more than one-fifth of the water in the Amu \nDarya. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is providing technical assistance to improve the \nregional management of water resources in Central Asia in response to requests from the \ngovernments of the CARs and Afghanistan.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.    Water Resources and the Aral Sea. The Syr Darya and Amu Darya support most of \nthe agricultural and rural economy in the Aral Sea basin. The rivers contribute significantly to \neconomic  growth  and  welfare  by  providing  water  for  irrigation,  as  well  as  municipal  and \ndomestic use. The rivers\u2019 water is essential because much of Central Asia is arid, with rainfall \nonly 100\u2013200 millimeters annually in the southern steppes. Under the Soviet Union, significant \ndevelopment of irrigation infrastructure, mainly for cotton production, exploited the waters of the \nAmu Darya and Syr Darya. However, the management of water and land resources associated \nwith this development has been unsustainable. The Aral Sea, once the fourth-largest body of \nfreshwater in the world, has shrunk by more than 50% because of reduced flows and has \nbecome  hypersaline.  Its  ecosystem  has  collapsed,  causing  an  environmental,  social,  and \neconomic disaster for the 4 million people who live in the vicinity of the Aral Sea. \n \n3.    In  response  to  the  Aral  Sea  crisis,  the  governments  of  the  five  CARs  signed  an \nagreement in 1992 to establish the Interstate Commission for Water Coordination (ICWC) to \noversee water allocation. The CARs and their development partners established the first Aral \nSea Basin Program and the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea in 1994. The first Aral \nSea Basin Program was finalized in 1997 and included regional water strategies, information \nsystems, water quality management, integrated land and water resources management, and \ncapacity building. In 2003, the CARs prepared the second Aral Sea Basin Program for 2003\u2013\n2010, but progress has been limited. Despite of the attention and resources devoted to the first \nAral Sea Basin Program, little progress has been made in rectifying the environmental, social, \nand economic problems created through desiccation of the Aral Sea.  \n \n4.    Challenges to Improving Regional Cooperation for Water Resources. Regardless of \nthe ability of the CARs to redress the Aral Sea crisis, regional cooperation to manage water \nresources is vital to the region\u2019s economic well-being. During the time of the Soviet Union, water \nallocation among the CARs was centrally planned to maximize benefits from irrigation and \npower generation, with the upstream countries compensated with energy supply in the winter. \nThe arrangements to ensure the transfer of regional benefits from sharing water among the \nCARs no longer exist. In the absence of any permanent water sharing agreements, allocation is \ndecided  annually  on  ad  hoc  basis  under  the  ICWC  and  managed  by  the  basin  water \nmanagement organizations for the Syr Darya (BVO Syr Darya) and Amu Darya (BVO Amu \nDarya) under the ICWC. In addition, Afghanistan is not included in the current water allocation \ndecision making and the BVO Amu Darya. Water management challenges are also mounting \nbecause higher agricultural production and hydropower generation are urgently needed, yet \nclimate change poses uncertainty for water resources planning. The lack of regional cooperation \non water resources poses a major threat to economic integration and growth in Central Asia. \n                                                 \n1 Central Asia includes Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n2 The RETA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 February 2008. No activities \nwill take place in a developing member country under the RETA until a confirmation of a no objection in writing has \nbeen received from the government of that country.  \n ", "2 \n5.    Stronger regional cooperation on water resources, particularly on the Amu Darya, is \nurgently needed to support regional economic growth. However, the knowledge base must be \nimproved  to  develop  an  agreement  to  manage  transboundary  water.  Inadequate \nhydrometeorological (hydromet) technical systems, data collection, and protocols for sharing \ninformation, combined with the weak capacity of regional and national institutions, hamper \nregional cooperation. A framework to assess the economic benefits from regional cooperation \non water resources is also needed. This requires an agreed methodology to determine the \nbenefits and trade-offs from different water resources management and development scenarios, \nwhich can support dialogue for a water allocation agreement on the Amu Darya. To facilitate this, \na robust forum is needed for the CARs and Afghanistan to explore options to strengthen \ninstitutional arrangements and actions to improve regional management of water resources.  \n \n6.    ADB Support for Regional Cooperation. ADB has been engaged in the CARs only \nsince 1994. However, regional cooperation has always been an important element of ADB\u2019s \nprogram in the CARs, most notably through the creation of the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Program.3 CAREC\u2019s first ministerial conference in 2002 confirmed the \nthree priority areas of its program\u2014transport, energy, and trade. CAREC\u2019s comprehensive \naction plan, adopted in 2006, broadened its mission to include human development, agriculture, \nenvironment, and tourism. However, CAREC\u2019s program does not include water resources, and \nADB developed a separate regional technical assistance (RETA) to address water resources. \n \n7.    ADB supported regional cooperation for water resources in the CARs under a RETA \nproject entitled Improved Management of Shared Water Resources in Central Asia, which was \napproved in 2003 and closed in December 2007.4 This RETA included support to (i) establish \nand operate the Chu\u2013Talas Joint Rivers Commission (CTJRC) between Kazakhstan and the \nKyrgyz Republic, (ii) facilitate regional water policy discussions, and (iii) build regional water \nmanagement capacity. The CTJRC has achieved the following: (i) cost-sharing of operations \nand maintenance on shared facilities, (ii) improvement in the interstate agreement for water \nresources in the Chu and Talas basins, and (iii) installation of a management information \nsystem to help operate the Kirov reservoir. The CTJRC is an excellent example of regional \ncooperation for water resources that provides mutual benefits. Additional actions are planned to \nstrengthen the CTJRC through support for its secretariat and expert working groups. However, \nthis requires financial support until the CTJRC becomes self-financed and fully institutionalized. \n \n8.    The  2003  RETA  supported  dialogue  to  review  and  improve  the  1998  framework \nagreement on the use of water and energy resources in the Syr Darya basin. This culminated in \na new draft agreement, but more work is needed to finalize the agreement and to ensure its \napproval at higher levels of government. Based on this experience, and given the importance of \nwater resources for sustained regional economic growth, it is essential that a water resources \nagreement be discussed in the broader context of economic integration and regional growth. \nThe dialogue must be conducted at the highest levels to ensure these broader issues are \naddressed, and that senior policy makers are involved to endorse the process and outcomes. \nSustainable  and  acceptable  agreements  and  their  implementation,  require  a  long-term \ncommitment, adequate resources, and an established forum for dialogue at the highest levels.\n                                                 \n3   CAREC includes the following countries: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Kazakhstan, the \nKyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. It also includes the following institutions: ADB, European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development, International Monetary Fund, Islamic Development Bank, the United \nNations Development Programme, and the World Bank. \n4  ADB. 2003.

Impact and Outcome \n \n9.    The impact of the proposed RETA will be sustainable economic development in the \nCARs and Afghanistan through improvements in regional cooperation on transboundary water \nresources management. The RETA outcomes are (i) an improved knowledge base and capacity \nfor water resources management of the Amu Darya; (ii) a stronger institutional framework for \nwater resources management of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya, and an institutionalized forum \nand process to support dialogue and further actions; and (iii) a more reliable water supply in the \nChu and Talas basins. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.    Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.   The RETA will have two sets of activities. The first set (components 1 and 2) will support \nimprovements  in  regional  cooperation  for  Amu  Darya  and  Syr  Darya.  The  second  set \n(component 3) will focus on the Chu and Talas basins. For the Amu Darya and Syr Darya \ninterventions,  a  steering  committee  will  be  established  to  develop  and  endorse  the  work \nprogram of the RETA, decide policy, and provide guidance for the RETA. National working \ngroups (NWGs) will execute the work program with support from a technical secretariat under \nthe direction of the steering committee. The RETA will support continued dialogue among the \nriparian states to finalize for government consideration the draft agreement on the use of water \nand energy resources in the Syr Darya basin initiated under the 2003 RETA project (footnote 4). \nHowever, this proposed RETA will expand the scope of the dialogue to include the development \nof a draft agreement on water resources of the Amu Darya, including Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The RETA approach will allow the steering \ncommittee broad latitude over the program of work, the pace and content of the dialogue, and \nanalytical work to generate consensus and ownership of the process and RETA outcomes.5 \n \n11.   The RETA will also seek to institutionalize dialogue and development of agreements and \naction plans concerning regional cooperation on water resources under a more permanent \nforum. It is also important that the broader issues of regional integration and economic growth \nare part of the dialogue, and that the dialogue receives the attention of the highest policy \nmakers.  Given  the  vital  importance  of  transboundary  cooperation  on  water  resources  for \nregional economic growth, one promising option is to bring water resources under the CAREC \nprogram. However, this approach would require deliberate discussions with all stakeholders. \nThe CTJRC that was established with support from the 2003 RETA project will implement the \nactivities for the Chu\u2013Talas component. All RETA activities will include capacity development. \n \n12.    Component 1: Improved Knowledge Base for the Amu Darya. The RETA will support \ntechnical  and  analytical  work  to  establish  the  foundation  needed  to  enhance  regional \ncooperation in the Amu Darya basin. This will include strengthening the hydromet network for \nAmu Darya through (i) analysis of the existing network and the collection and exchange of data \namong agencies with recommendations for improvement; (ii) recommendations for physical and \ntechnical improvements to the hydromet network; (iii) development of a framework for efficient \nand  effective  hydromet  data  exchange  and  analysis  among  national  and  regional  water \nmanagement organizations, such as the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea, ICWC, and \nBVO Amu Darya; and (iv) scoping technical studies to strengthen knowledge of hydrological, \nmorphological, and other water resources issues to improve management of the basin. \n \n                                                 \n5  Additional initiatives for regional cooperation are under way, such as a new European Union-established water \nenergy institute in Bishkek and United Nations-sponsored initiative on regional water issues. The RETA will \ncoordinate with these activities as appropriate to enhance the impact and outcomes of the RETA. \n ", "4 \n13.   The RETA will develop a methodology to assess economic, social, environmental, and \nother benefits of regional cooperation with regard to Amu Darya water resources. It will explore \nthe impacts of managing and developing water resources under various scenarios throughout \nthe Amu Darya basin. The work will assess the benefits and trade-offs of regional cooperation \non water resources management as a basis to help draft an agreement on water resources of \nthe Amu Darya. The RETA will identify and research additional priority issues that are needed to \nenhance regional cooperation on water resources, or that are of common concern for RETA \nparticipants, such as integrated water resources management (IWRM), irrigation management, \nand water conservation. The NWGs, with steering committee oversight, will be responsible for \nsupporting component 1. International and local specialists within the technical secretariat will \nsupport  the  NWGs  and  help  with  capacity  development.  Outputs  will  include  studies,  a \nframework and assessment of the benefits of regional cooperation on water resources, reports, \nand capacity development materials. \n \n14.   Component  2: Strengthened  Institutional  Framework  and  Institutionalization  of \nRegional  Cooperation  for  Water  Resources. This component will facilitate dialogue and \ninstitutional strengthening to enhance regional cooperation on water resources management of \nthe Syr Darya and Amu Darya basins. Technical and analytical work carried out by the NWGs \nand the technical secretariat under component 1 will support the dialogue and the steering \ncommittee\u2019s program of work at regular meetings. This component will (i) review the institutional \nand organizational framework for transboundary water management in the Amu Darya basin, (ii) \nrecommend ways to strengthen cooperation, and (iii) develop a draft interstate agreement of the \nAmu Darya basin that includes Afghanistan for government consideration. The RETA will also \nsupport finalization of the draft agreement on the use of water and energy resources in the Syr \nDarya basin for government consideration.6 The steering committee, with NWG and technical \nsecretariat support, will evaluate options, especially CAREC, to institutionalize the dialogue and \nactions to strengthen regional cooperation for water resources. It will also develop a long-term \nprogram  of  work,  budget,  and  implementation  arrangements  for  continued  dialogue  and \ndevelopment of agreements, and strategies and action plans for regional cooperation on water \nresources. Specialists in the technical secretariat will help facilitate steering committee meetings \nand present topical seminars on transboundary water management. Outputs will include briefing \ndocuments; technical analysis; steering committee meeting minutes; an institutional analysis for \nmanagement  of  the  Amu  Darya;  seminars  and  capacity  development  materials;  draft \ncooperation agreements for the Syr Darya and Amu Darya; and a long-term plan, budget, and \nimplementation arrangements to support dialogue and action for regional cooperation on water \nresources management. \n \n15.   Component 3: Support to the Chu\u2013Talas Joint Rivers Commission. Building on the \nfoundation established under the 2003 RETA on managing water resources in Central Asia, this \nRETA will continue supporting the CTJRC, its secretariat, and expert working groups. Under the \n2003 RETA, the CTJRC secretariat prepared a detailed program to be implemented through \nApril 2011. Outputs will include (i) revision of the 2000 agreement between Kazakhstan and the \nKyrgyz Republic on interstate water facilities in the Chu and Talas basins; (ii) testing and \nintroduction of computerized water assessment and allocation modules for the Chu and Talas \n                                                 \n6  While the RETA will support continued development and refinement of draft agreements for the two rivers, formal \napproval of the agreements by the governments will be subject to political considerations. Accordingly, the RETA's \nimpacts should be measured largely against the development of a common understanding and framework for water \nresources  management,  an  improved  knowledge  base,  the  extent  of  information  sharing  and  capacity \ndevelopment, and technically sound agreements for better regional cooperation for water resources management, \nrather than solely upon the immediate approval of the agreements. While work will be initiated on the draft \nagreements under the RETA, it may not be completed until after the end of the RETA. In this case, activities would \ncontinue under a new program of work. \n ", "5 \nbasins; (iii) preparation of IWRM plans for each basin; and (iv) IWRM knowledge dissemination \nin the Chu and Talas basins. \n \nC.    Cost and Financing \n \n16.   The RETA is estimated to cost $1.178 million, of which $0.998 million will be financed on \na grant basis by the ADB Multi-Donor Trust Fund7 under the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility, and administered by ADB. The governments will contribute local currency equivalent to \n$180,000. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.    Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.   ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA, which will start in October 2008 and run \nfor 18 months. The members of the NWGs, who will be appointed by the governments of \nparticipating countries, will comprise representatives of water, hydromet, environment, planning, \nand other agencies, as appropriate. Heads of the NWGs will be members of the steering \ncommittee  and  have  the  authority  to  represent  their  countries  in  all  meetings  and  sign \ndocuments, such as draft agreements and meeting minutes. The NWGs will be responsible for \nexecuting all RETA activities with support from the technical secretariat. \n \n18.   The  steering  committee  will  comprise  the  heads  of  the  NWGs  and  other  national \nrepresentatives, as appropriate, and representatives from regional organizations such as the \nInternational Fund for Saving the Aral Sea, ICWC, the BVO Syr Darya and Amu Darya, and the \nother relevant organizations. It will meet regularly to provide policy guidance and to coordinate \nwith national governments and ADB.8 The steering committee and NWGs will be supported by \nthe technical secretariat, which will include national and international consultants to provide \ntechnical inputs and administrative assistance to the steering committee and NWGs.9 Capacity \ndevelopment activities will be established in consultation with the steering committee, NWGs, \ntechnical secretariat, and ADB. The NWGs will be provided with resources to recruit on a short-\nterm basis national consultants or government institutes with relevant expertise to implement \nspecific tasks for the steering committee\u2019s program of work. Implementation of the Chu\u2013Talas \ncomponent of the Project will be undertaken by the CTJRC secretariat, expert working groups, \nand national consultants supported by the RETA. It is anticipated that 17 person-months of \ninternational consulting services and 144 person-months of national consulting services will be \nrequired  in  (i)  water  resources  management  and  engineering,  (ii) hydrology  and \nhydrometeorology, (iii) irrigation, (iv) economics, (v) law, and (vi) institutional analysis, among \nothers. The terms of reference are in Appendix 3. ADB will recruit consultants on an individual \nbasis in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). Procurement will be in accordance with ADB Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). RETA outputs and the outcome evaluation will be disseminated \nthrough the ADB and CTJRC websites; CAREC meetings and materials; and brochures and \nvideo. \n \nIV.
