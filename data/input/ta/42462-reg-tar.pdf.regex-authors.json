", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) plays a key role in assisting Central and West \nAsian countries1 to move toward low-carbon growth strategies. The Central and West Asia \nDepartment  (CWRD)  Climate  Change  Implementation  Plan  (CCIP)  will  outline  prospective \ninvestments in energy efficiency, renewable energy, sustainable transport, waste management, \nand  adaptation  interventions  for  sustainable  water  and  land  management.  The  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  will  complement  investments  with  analysis,  planning,  capacity \ndevelopment, and project preparation support. The TA will help countries to develop climate \nchange policies, develop capacity of national climate change institutions, remove barriers to \nrenewable  energy  development,  and  develop  incentives  and  penalties  to  promote  energy \ninefficiency. It will foster carbon market development, assist with climate change adaptation \nplanning, and provide for climate-proofing of ADB investment projects.     \n \n2.  Consultations were undertaken during a mission  to Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan (October 2008) to initiate preparation of the CCIP and to \nconduct  fact-finding  for  the  regional  capacity  development  TA.  Stakeholders,  including  the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) focal points, relevant \ngovernment agencies (e.g., for energy, transport, and agriculture), climate change research \ninstitutes, and nongovernment organizations, were consulted. The mission also consulted with \nCentral Asian Countries Initiative for Land Management partners on climate change adaptation \nopportunities. Based on these consultations and discussion with ADB country directors, the \nobjectives, preliminary scope, and suggested implementation arrangements for the TA were \ndeveloped. The TA received concept clearance on 16 December 2008.2    \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Climate Change Impacts. Indications are that climate change is already occurring in \ncentral and western Asia with detectable impacts (i.e., decline in crop yields, retreat of glaciers, \nincreases in climate-induced disease and heat stress, and changes in ecosystem functions). 3 \nFuture climate change is projected to negatively affect land and water resources\u2014and thus \nagriculture\u2014thereby  increasing  food  insecurity  and  water  scarcity.  Warmer  temperatures, \nincreased evaporation, reduced runoff, melting of glaciers and associated negative changes in \nriver flows, and higher frequency of droughts and flooding are major threats. Climate change \nmay cause large tracts of natural grasslands to disappear, thus leading to further desertification.   \n \n4.  Adaptation.  Substantial  adaptation  interventions  will  be  necessary  to  address  the \nimpacts of projected climate change. Immediate investments are needed to protect and/or \nreduce the risks from increased flooding, drought, dust storms, and other anticipated impacts of \nclimate change. Although a wide array of response options are already available,4 there are \nbarriers, limits, and cost constraints on their implementation.  \n \n                                                 \n1  In this report, Central and West Asian countries refer to ADB's 10 developing member countries in Central and \nWest  Asia:  Afghanistan,  Armenia,  Azerbaijan,  Georgia,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Pakistan,  Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 January 2009. \n3  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 2007.

Parry, et al.

Although most Central and West Asian countries are low greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emitters, they are among the most carbon-intensive economies in the world. This creates \nopportunities  for  mitigating  interventions.  Mitigation  projects  involving  improved  energy \nefficiency, fuel switching, industrial processes, renewable energy, improved waste management \nsystems, and land restoration offer cost-effective opportunities for carbon financing. Some key \nactivities may provide much-needed synergies between mitigation and adaptation, especially in \nrenewable energy, water, and land resource management.  \n \n6.  Institutional  Response. All Central and West Asian countries are members of the \nUNFCCC. All except Afghanistan have ratified the Kyoto Protocol. However, the necessary \nclimate  change  institutions  (national  climate  change  coordination  councils,  climate  change \ncoordination centers, and designated national authorities [DNAs] for the Clean Development \nMechanism [CDM]) are not well developed. While these institutions have been established in \nmost countries, they are not fully functional and remain reliant on donor assistance. While \nactivities have been initiated in all Central and West Asian countries, this has not generally \ntranslated into concerted action. Numerous problems, constraints, and barriers remain, and \nmany opportunities for carbon financing have not been funded. There are limited incentives to \npromote  energy  efficiency  (or  penalties  for  failing  to  do  so).  Institutional,  financial,  and \ntechnological barriers need to be removed to foster renewable energy. Few resources have \nbeen allocated to reduce the vulnerability of water, hydropower, and agricultural sectors to \nclimate change.  \n \n7.  ADB  Assistance.    ADB  has  been  promoting  climatic  change  adaptation  through \nsustainable land and water management. The ADB-led Central Asian Countries Initiative for \nLand Management is working to restore, maintain, and enhance the productive functions of land \nin  Central  Asia,  to  improve  economic  and  social  well-being.  ADB  is  supporting  regional \ncooperation for integrated water resources management through regional technical assistance \nprojects.5  ADB has also been assisting some Central and West Asian countries to respond to \nthe challenge of climate change through renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives. In \nPakistan,  ADB  provided  assistance  in  renewable  energy  and  in  formulating  medium-term \nrenewable  energy  policy.6  The  multitranche  financing  facility  for  the  Renewable  Energy \nDevelopment Sector Investment Program ($510 million) will fund up to eight subprojects for \nPakistan (footnote 6). In addition, project preparatory TA for the Sustainable Energy Efficiency \nDevelopment  Program  is  preparing  subprojects  in  energy  efficiency  and  conservation  for \nfinancing in 2009.7 ADB also provided TA to Uzbekistan in the rural renewable energy sector.8   \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2006.

The ADB regional TA for the Promotion of Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, and \nGreenhouse Gas Abatement Projects (PREGA) promoted investments in renewable energy, \nenergy efficiency, and GHG abatement technologies that would increase access to energy \nservices by the poor and help reduce GHG emissions.9 It covered 18 developing member \ncountries (DMCs), including: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and \nUzbekistan. PREGA was the successor to the ADB regional TA for the Study of a Least-Cost \nGreenhouse Abatement Strategy for Asia, which undertook GHG inventories from 1994 to 1999 \nin 11 DMCs, including Pakistan.10 The study was a key part of ADB\u2019s assistance to strengthen \nDMCs\u2019 capacity to participate in the UNFCCC, including the Kyoto Protocol.  \n  \n9.  Lessons from PREGA. Participating countries were found to have significant potential \nto  develop  renewable  energy,  energy  efficiency,  and  GHG  abatement  projects  despite \ndeficiencies  in  policies,  weaknesses  in  implementation,  and  limited  technical  project \ndevelopment capacities. While PREGA addressed these deficiencies, local capacity to prepare \nrealistic, technically sound, and fundable projects was found to require further improvement. \nPREGA found that, for larger DMCs, it may be more fruitful to work at a provincial or regional \nlevel, which is likely to be more responsive than a national government. For smaller DMCs, \nprogress was possible where local champions made a difference. Such was the case in Nepal, \nwhere  national  technical  experts  championed  capacity  development  with  DNAs  and  other \nstakeholders to unlock a pipeline of CDM projects. PREGA also demonstrated the importance of \nfocusing on a limited set of interventions coordinated by effective participation of a focal agency. \n \n10.  Low-Carbon Growth. The overall goal is to help DMCs develop low-carbon economies \nwhile sustaining economic growth. This means assisting DMCs to increase economic output \nwhile (i) becoming more efficient in their use of energy, (ii) using renewable energy to replace \ncarbon-based fuels in the electrical power sector, (iii) accelerating development of low-carbon \ntechnologies, (iv) changing the behavior of business and consumers, and (v) preserving and \nexpanding carbon sinks (e.g., forests, grasslands). This requires DMCs to introduce policy and \ninstitutional changes. In addition to promoting climate change benefits, policies directed to \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency often generate economic benefits, promote energy \nsecurity, and reduce environmental pollution. Unfortunately, there is no blueprint to follow. As \nyet, there is no well-informed policy dialogue ongoing in most Central and West Asian countries.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  impact  will  be  low-carbon  inclusive  economic  growth  and  climate-resilient \ndevelopment (Appendix 1). The outcome will be a favorable policy, technological, and fiscal \nenvironment for investment in climate change mitigation and adaptation interventions. It is \nexpected to foster new investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency improvements, and \nadaptation  measures.  It  also  should  promote  climate-change  policy  dialogue  and  develop \nfunctional DNAs for CDM, functional climate change centers, and functional carbon markets.   \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2000.

Outputs are (i) climate change policy development, (ii) capacity development for climate \nchange institutions, (iii) institutional and technological development for renewable energy, (iv) \ndevelopment of incentives, penalties, and investments to promote energy efficiency, (v) project \ndesign  documents  for  submission  to  carbon  funds,  (vi) development  of  climate  change \nadaptation interventions and preparation of investment and financing plans, (vii) support for \nproject preparation and (viii) project management, coordination and knowledge management.  \n \n13.  Support for Implementing the Climate Change Implementation Plan. The TA will \nsupport the main elements of the CCIP. The CCIP will be implemented through individual \ncountry  partnership  strategies  and  country  operational  business  plans.  CWRD  will  support \ndevelopment of climate change policy directed toward low-carbon growth. It will build its portfolio \nof investments in clean energy, renewable energy, and energy efficiency improvements. It will \ncontinue  to  make  investments  in  sustainable  land  and  water  management,  which  will \nincreasingly be based on national adaptation plans. It will assist DMCs to tap carbon markets to \nobtain additional resources needed for implementing clean energy and other GHG mitigation \nprojects.  \n   \n14.  Under the TA, climate change policy analyses will assist DMCs not only to formulate \npolicy but also to understand the macroeconomic effects and structural adjustments of such \npolicies. To promote policy adoption and implementation, CWRD will assist DMCs in obtaining \nfinancing to support necessary adjustments and examine how DMCs can use the international \ncarbon  markets  to  its  maximum  advantage.  ADB  will  examine  how  policy-based  program \nlending can help selected DMCs make necessary transitions onto low-carbon growth paths. \n \n15.  With respect to mitigation, the TA will help to remove financial and institutional barriers to \nrenewable energy development and to develop appropriate incentives and/or disincentives that \npromote energy efficiency. The TA will be used to develop GHG inventory systems and support \nenergy modeling to better estimate current and future emissions. It will build capacity of the \nDNAs for the CDM, and will conduct an assessment of carbon markets in DMCs. Resources will \nbe allocated to prepare carbon financing to support ADB\u2019s investments.  \n \n16.  With respect to adaptation, the TA will help remove policy constraints (e.g., distorting \nsubsidies) that constrain sound adaptation practices while encouraging measures that support \nadaptation  and  climate  risk  management.  It  will  build  capacity  of  national  climate  change \ninstitutions to assess climate change impacts, on water resources, hydropower, and agriculture. \nThe  TA  will  also  strengthen  national  climate  change  adaptation  planning.  Climate  change \nconsiderations will be integrated into ADB operations through climate-proofing investments.  \n \n17.  It is anticipated that outputs can be readily scaled up, adapted, and/or replicated. The TA \nis  expected  to  produce  replicable  models  for  (i)  climate  change  policy  and  regulations, \n(ii) renewable energy policy and regulations, (iii) energy efficiency incentives (e.g., subsidies, \ntax credits) and penalties (e.g., taxes, fines), (iv) institutional arrangements for DNAs for CDM, \n(v) systems for GHG emissions inventories and reporting, (vi) adaptation policies, (vii) tested \napproaches (methodologies and modeling) for impact analyses, (viii) climate change adaptation \nstrategies and plans, and (ix) tested climate-proofing procedures and guidelines. \n \n18.  Assumptions and Risks. A fundamental assumption is that there is a commitment to \ndevelop a coordinated approach to address climate change. This requires that DMCs be ready \nto make changes in institutions and public expenditure practices, as well as that international \n ", "  5\nagencies stand ready to provide necessary financing. It is assumed that there is government (i) \nwillingness to participate in policy dialogue, (ii) commitment to long-term support of climate \nchange institutions, (iii) support to introducing new regulatory regimes for renewable energy and \nfor new incentives and penalties promoting energy efficiency, and (v) initiative to embark on \nclimate change adaptation programs. Finally, there is a risk that interventions will not lead to \ndecreased GHG emissions and reduced vulnerability to climate change.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The estimated cost is $5.5 million, with $5.0 million financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTA funding program (Technical Assistance Special Fund IV). Participating countries will make \nin-kind contributions totaling $500,000. Appendix 2 provides the cost estimate and financing \nplan.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  CWRD  will  administer  and  implement  the  TA. \nActivities will be undertaken selectively in all Central and West Asian countries. Initial fact-\nfinding and consultations (Appendix 3) indicate that DMCs can be grouped into three categories: \n(i) DMCs where adaptation and mitigation are high priorities (e.g., Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, \nPakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan), (ii) DMCs where a focus on renewable energy and energy \nefficiency is expected to be strong (e.g., Azerbaijan), and (iii) DMCs where the initial focus will \nbe on improving institutional and absorptive capacity.  \n \n21.  Stakeholder consultations will be conducted during project inception to identify capacity \ndevelopment and policy analysis priorities. In each DMC, a focal agency will be chosen, but \nassistance may flow to more than one agency. The focal agency will organize stakeholder \nconsultations, agree to results-based work plans and budgets, and monitor implementation.  \n \n22.  The TA is expected to start 1 May 2009 and be completed by 30 April 2012. International \nconsultants (about 134 person-months) and national consultants (about 276 person-months) will \nbe required. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. It is anticipated that a firm will be \nrecruited  using  quality  and  cost-based  selection  with  a  simplified  technical  proposal.  It  is \nanticipated the consultants will be contracted through an indefinite delivery contract to match the \npriorities of each country and needs of project preparation. Consultants will be engaged by ADB \nin accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Disbursements will be made in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook11.  \n \n23.  A project performance monitoring system will be developed. Quarterly progress reports \nwill  be  prepared.  A  knowledge  management  system  will  facilitate  knowledge  sharing  and \ncapture lessons and good practices. Key knowledge products will be disseminated, and annual \nworkshops will bring together participating countries to report on progress and share information.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n24.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $5,000,000 on a grant basis for Enabling Climate Change \nInterventions in Central and West Asia.  \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2008.
