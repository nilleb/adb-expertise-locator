THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Chemical Industry Energy Efficiency and \nEmission Reduction Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will use the financial intermediation loan (FIL) modality to finance \ninnovative,  high-impact  technologies  and  process  transformations  that  will  improve  energy \nefficiency and reduce emissions from selected plants of the China National Chemical Group \n(ChemChina).2 It will leverage Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing by (i) using a revolving \nescrow fund (REF) for multiple rollover of ADB funding, (ii) engaging in collaborative commercial \ncofinancing, and (iii) employing a sector-specific energy service company (ESCO).3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The chemical industry is the second largest industrial energy consumer in the PRC.4 In \n2013, it consumed about 457 million tons of coal equivalent (tce), or about 16.6% of the PRC\u2019s \ntotal industrial energy consumption. It is also one of the PRC\u2019s most energy-intensive industries. \nIn 2013, its energy intensity of 1.78 tce per CNY10,000 output was about 5.5% below the 2010 \nlevel but still twice as high as the best international standards. With a target of 20%, the \nchemical industry is expected to make larger contributions to energy intensity improvement \nduring the period of the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 compared to the national target \nacross all economic sectors of 16%. The Government of the PRC is expected to take a more \nstringent approach in the period of the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 and beyond to (i) \nslow the growth in coal consumption and overall energy demand by 2020, and (ii) achieve a \npeaking in the PRC\u2019s carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions by 2030. \n2\n \n4.  The PRC\u2019s chemical industry faces unique challenges to further reduce energy intensity \nbecause unlike other major chemical producers worldwide, it predominantly uses coal rather \nthan petroleum or natural gas as feedstock and fuel.5 Coal-based processes are inherently \nmore energy intensive and produce significantly more greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and \nlocal air pollution. Technology innovations and process transformations are essential to further \nimprove  energy  efficiency  and  reduce  emissions.  Many  such  technologies  and  process \ntransformations  have  been  researched  and  successfully  pilot  tested  in  the  PRC,  but  their \ncommercial deployment has been delayed by various barriers (para. 7).   \n \n5.  The PRC\u2019s chemical industry is a major emitter of air and other toxic pollutants, and \nGHGs. In 2013, the chemical industry discharged more wastewater, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen \noxides than any other industry in the country. Within the chemical industry, the production of \nplastics is particularly energy and emission intensive. Fluoropolymer, a synthetic carbon-based \nplastic  commonly  used  to  provide  corrosion-resistant  coating,  is  an  important  source  of \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ChemChina is the largest state-owned enterprise in the chemical industry of the PRC. It owns more than 100 \nindustries and 24 research and development institutes. In 2014, the group\u2019s turnover reached CNY244 billion. \n3  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for Preparing the \nChemical Industry Energy Efficiency and Emission Reduction Project. Manila.  \n4  The iron and steel industry is the PRC\u2019s largest industrial energy consumer.  \n5  Coal is preferred because it is abundantly available and holds a cost advantage in the domestic market. ", "2   \nemissions of fluoroform (HFC-23), a GHG that is 14,800 times more potent than CO .6 HFC-23 \n2\nincineration technologies are available, but they have not been deployed widely in the PRC \nbecause of inadequate regulation and incentives.7  \n \n6.  More than 80% of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) production in the PRC uses coal-derived \nfeedstock8 and a catalyst based on mercury, a toxic chemical element that persists in the \nenvironment once mobilized.9 PVC production accounts for more than 70% of domestic and \nnearly 50% of global intentional use of mercury. Moreover, to provide mercury for this industrial \nuse, mercury mining is still practiced in the PRC, posing a major threat to the environment and \npublic health. In 2010, the government issued a notice to phase out the use of mercury in the \nPVC industry. Research for an alternative catalyst was included in the National Basic Research \nProgram, but to date no alternative catalyst has been demonstrated at commercial scale. \n \n7.  ChemChina is the PRC\u2019s largest producer of fluoropolymer, PVC, synthetic resins, and \nfine  chemicals.  Potent  technologies  and  process  transformations  that  can  improve  energy \nefficiency and lead to deep cuts in emissions in the industry have been developed and pilot \ntested  by  ChemChina\u2019s  research  and  development  institutes,  such  as  mercury-free  PVC \nproduction.  However,  their  scale-up  has  been  difficult  because  of  (i)  perceived  and  real \ntechnical risks; (ii) the need for debt financing, which commercial financing institutions with their \nweak understanding of the financial viability of such projects are unable to provide; (iii) lack of \nstrict regulatory requirements to incentivize investments as relevant technologies have not been \ndemonstrated at commercial scale; and (iv) the lack of a suitable ESCO that can bring together \ntechnical know-how and suitable financing. \n \n8.  The ESCO sector, which has been effective in driving energy efficiency investments in \nother countries, is a priority for the government. ESCOs have grown rapidly in the PRC since \n2006, numbering more than 5,000 and reaching a turnover of more than CNY165 billion by the \nend of 2013. But the ESCOs still lack (i) the capacity to finance and implement more complex \nand larger industrial energy efficiency projects; (ii) access to or knowledge of innovative, high-\nimpact technologies; and (iii) the service standards needed to build trust among financiers and \nhost  industries.  Also, there  are  no  industry-specific  ESCOs  with  technical  expertise  in  the \nchemical industry. \n \n9.  ADB support will be crucial to address the key issues and barriers identified in paras. 7 \nand 8 and facilitate to commercial-scale demonstration of strategic technologies. ADB funding \nsupports de-risking of investments and ADB due diligence and enhanced monitoring measures \nwill ensure that technical and other associated risks are adequately managed. Moreover, the \nbusiness models developed with ADB support will ensure timely replication. Because of the \nrelatively shorter payback period (5 to 7 years) for typical industrial energy efficiency projects, \nthe FIL modality was chosen to allow multiple rollover of the ADB loan over the loan tenor. By \nfurther leveraging commercial cofinancing with ADB funding, the project will target a higher \nimpact in improving energy efficiency and emission reduction than would otherwise be possible \n                                                \n6  In 2013, the PRC emitted nearly 9,500 tons of untreated HFC-23, or nearly 140 million tons of CO  equivalent. \n2\n7  HFC-23 destruction involves an energy penalty at the plant level. Its inclusion among the clean development \nmechanism\u2013eligible mitigation measures led to its use in some plants in the PRC and to disproportionately high \nclean development mechanism credits earned. But the decision to stop buying such credits from 2013 onwards has \ndrastically stalled the wider adoption of HFC-23 destruction measures.  \n8  Although it is more than twice as energy intensive as the petroleum-based process, the coal-based process is \nmore cost-effective in the PRC because of the lower price of coal (about one-third the price of petroleum).  \n9  From 2002 to 2013, the PRC\u2019s PVC production increased from 3.0 million tons to 12.5 million tons using the coal-\nbased process. As a result, mercury use in this sector increased from 350 tons to about 1,300 tons.  \n ", "3 \nwith a project loan. The two subprojects in the first batch will scale up pilot-tested innovative \ntechnologies in selected ChemChina plants to (i) reduce energy consumption and eliminate \nmercury use in one of the largest PVC plants, and (ii) destroy HFC-23 at a major fluoropolymer \nplant.10 Packaging HFC-23 destruction at the selected fluoropolymer plant with state-of-the-art \nenergy efficiency measures will (i) support the financial viability of the investment even under a \nvery weak incentive structure and despite the energy penalties for HFC-23 destruction, and (ii) \ndemonstrate a new business model in the process. It will also directly support and demonstrate \nthe commercial viability of industry-specific ESCO financing and services for such projects. \n \n10.  ADB  has  supported  three  other  industrial  energy  efficiency  and  emission  reduction \nprojects in the provinces of Guangdong, Hebei, and Shandong.11 The following lessons from the \nprevious projects have been incorporated in the project design: (i) the choice of the FIL modality \nwith 10-year grace period was adopted from previous designs, as this was found best suited for \nscaling up the impact of ADB assistance; (ii) a more rigorous review of first batch subprojects \nwas  conducted  to  avoid  dropping  out  of  one  or  more  subprojects  and  to  ensure  timely \ndisbursement;  and  (iii) a  professional  ESCO  with  competent  technical  staff and  access to \nrelevant  technologies  was  chosen  as  the  project  implementation  unit  to  support  effective \nselection and appraisal of future subprojects, and reduce associated risks. Unlike the previous \nprojects, the proposed project applies ESCO use from first batch subprojects. This will reduce \nthe risk identified in the previous projects on the likelihood of ESCO engagement. \n \n11.  The project is closely aligned with (i) ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015,  \nand  the  emerging  priorities  of  the  next  country  partnership  strategy,  which  identifies \nenvironmental sustainability as a key pillar for ADB support in the PRC and emphasizes support \nfor energy efficiency improvements as a priority area in the energy sector; and (ii) ADB\u2019s Energy \nPolicy, which defines energy efficiency as a key measure toward clean energy development. 12   \n \nB.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n12.  The impact of the project will be enhanced environmental sustainability of the PRC\u2019s \nchemical industry. The outcome will be reduced energy intensity and emissions from PVC and \nfluoropolymer production within ChemChina. \n \n13.  The outputs will be (i) more efficient and less hazardous PVC technology demonstrated \nat commercial scale at the Dezhou Shihua Chemical (DSC) plant, and (ii) energy efficiency and \ngreenhouse gas abatement measures implemented at Zhonghao Chenguang Research Institute \nof Chemical Industry (CGY).13 \n \n                                                \n10 The first batch of subprojects selected by ADB met the technical, financial, economic, social, and safeguards \ncriteria explained in the Project Administration Manual (PAM) (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). The same selection criteria will be used in selecting subsequent batches of subprojects.  \n11  ADB. 2008.

The  first  subproject  will  demonstrate  a  scaled-up  application  of  a  successfully \npilot-tested mercury-free catalyst to produce PVC at the DSC plant in Dezhou, Shandong \nProvince.14 After completion, by 2019, the subproject is expected to reduce energy consumption \nin the DSC plant by 388,521 tce per year, or by 34%. It will also eliminate 35 tons of intentional \nuse of mercury per year by 2019 and avoid 1.359 million tons of CO  emissions. The successful \n2\ndemonstration of the new technology is likely to trigger the complete phase out of currently \napplied mercury-based technology making the replication potential therefore very large.15  \n \n15.  Under the second subproject, comprehensive energy efficiency optimization measures \nwill  be  implemented,  and  a  real-time  energy  management  system  will  be  installed.  These \nenergy efficiency investments will reduce the energy consumption of the CGY plant in Zigong \nCity, Sichuan Province by 10,888 tce per year. The measures will be combined with scaled-up \nplasma incineration of HFC-23 at the CGY plant.16 The effective destruction of 890 tons of HFC-\n23  will  avoid  emissions  of  13.1 million  tons  of  CO   equivalent  and  1,205  tons  of  organic \n2\nfluoride.17 Net energy savings from the subproject will be 8,905 tce.18 The packaging of HFC-23 \ndestruction with energy efficiency measures provides a business model for ESCOs that can be \nreplicated in similar plants in the PRC. \n \n16.  A  newly  established  ESCO,  Beijing  Zhonghao  Huatai  Energy  Technology  (Huatai), \nwhich is fully owned by China Haohua Chemical Group (CHC), will support the implementation \nof both subprojects in the first batch, and will identify and implement future subprojects applying \npredefined project selection criteria and the environmental and social management system \n(ESMS).19 For  the  first  subproject  at  DSC,  Huatai\u2019s  services  will  primarily  involve  hiring \ncontractors and supervising implementation of the subproject.20 For the second subproject at \nCGY, Huatai will, in addition, act as subborrower on the basis of an energy savings performance \ncontract with CGY.21 The implementation of the project will strengthen Huatai\u2019s capacities in \ndifferent service aspects of the ESCO business. Huatai will be assisted by CHC in effectively \nfacilitating financing, managing procurement, coordinating with and preparing reports to ADB, \nand promoting good governance and compliance with safeguards beyond the first batch of \nsubprojects. Its capacity will be strengthened as a result. \n \n                                                \n14  The technology was pilot tested in three phases: (i) laboratory scale, (ii) small scale, and (iii) industrial pilot-scale \ntesting of 2,000 tons per year. After validating the test results in August 2014, an independent panel of PVC \nexperts from the PRC determined the technology to be of international standard and approved it for commercial \nscale-up.  \n15 The PRC is party to the Minamata Convention on Mercury, which is aimed at eliminating the intentional use of \nmercury, and controlling and reducing global emissions of the toxic chemical. Annex B of the convention requires \nthat parties phase out mercury use in the PVC industry in a period of 5 years once the Conference of Parties has \nestablished that an alternative catalyst technology has been proven to be technically and commercially viable. \nMinamata Convention on Mercury. http://www.mercuryconvention.org/Portals/11/documents/Booklets/Minamata% \n20Convention%20on%20Mercury_booklet_English.pdf \n16 CGY\u2019s pilot plant has an incineration capacity of 200 tons of HFC-23 per year. It was set up in 2007 and has since \nmet all performance requirements reliably. Plasma incineration of HFC-23 has co-benefits in the form of avoided \nemissions of (i) toxic and carcinogenic dioxin, which can cause reproductive and developmental problems, and (ii) \norganic fluoride, a persistent and non-degradable poison that accumulates in soil, plants, wildlife, and humans.  \n17 In 2014, all of ADB\u2019s clean energy investments combined avoided about 7 million tons of CO  emissions.   \n2\n18 The plasma incineration of HFC-23 has an energy penalty of 1,983 tce per year. \n19 The associated costs for the establishment of the ESMS and the required training of project entities will be covered \nby Huatai, CHC, and ChemChina.  \n20 The engagement of Huatai through an energy savings performance contract is beyond the capacity of the first \nsubproject at DSC, which will have a total investment cost of more than $200 million.    \n21 Huatai\u2019s business plan, developed with ADB support during project preparation, identifies different business models \nfor different energy efficiency projects. Huatai is expected to develop a platform for commercializing innovative \nenergy efficiency technologies at ChemChina and beyond, on the basis of appropriate models. \n ", "5 \nC.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n      \n17.  The project investment cost, including the expected rollover of funds, is estimated at \n$565.0 million, $245.0 million of which is for the first batch of subprojects (Table 1). 22 \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nSubproject 1  205.7 \nSubproject 2  39.3 \nb\nTotal    245.0 \na  Includes taxes and duties of $19.66 million to be financed from government sources ($7.39 million) and ADB loan \nresources ($12.27 million).  \nb  In mid-2015 cost estimates.   \n  Physical contingencies were computed at 7% for civil works, and 7% for field research and development, training, \nsurveys, and studies. Price contingencies were computed at 1.5% on foreign exchange costs, and 3% on local \ncurrency costs; includes provision for potential exchange rate fluctuation under the assumption of a purchasing \npower parity exchange rate. \n  Includes interest and commitment charges. Interest during construction for ADB loan has been computed at the 3-\nyear forward London interbank offered rate plus a spread of 0.50%. Commitment charges for an ADB loan are \n0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n18.  The government has requested a loan of $100.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project, including transportation and insurance costs, taxes, and \nduties.23 The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 10 years,24 an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, a straight-line repayment option, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The average loan \nmaturity is 12.75 years; therefore, no maturity premium will be payable to ADB. The subproject \nborrowers  will  finance  $63.3  million  through  equity  contributions.  China  Construction  Bank \n(CCB) will cofinance $81.7 million on a collaborative basis. \n \n19.  The financing plan for the first batch of subprojects is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \n     Ordinary capital resources (loan)   100.0  40.81 \nCounterpart financing  63.3  25.83 \nChina Construction Bank   81.7  33.36 \nTotal  245.0  100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                \n22  For the first batch of subprojects, ADB subloan amounts will not exceed 55% of the total subproject investment \ncosts. For subsequent batches, financing from revolved ADB loan proceeds will be reduced to a maximum of 40% \nof the investment cost to encourage an increased share of cofinancing. Commercial cofinancing will match ADB \nfunds at a ratio of at least 1:1. Equity financing will not be less than 20%. As ADB loan proceeds are expected to \nbe rolled over 1.2 more times during the loan tenor, additional lending of $240 million and total investments of $320 \nmillion for future subprojects can be mobilized. \n23 The amount of taxes and duties was determined according to the following principles: the taxes and duties \n(i) should be consistent with the current country partnership strategy of ADB, (ii) should not represent an excessive \nshare of the project investment plan, and (iii) should apply only to ADB-financed expenditures. Moreover, the \nfinancing of the taxes and duties should be material and relevant to the success of the project. \n24 A longer grace period is essential to allow for an effective rollover of ADB loan proceeds.  \n ", "6   \n \n20.  The PRC will be the borrower. The loan proceeds will be onlent from the Ministry of \nFinance to CCB, from CCB to CHC through ChemChina on the terms and conditions in the loan \nagreement. CCB will charge an onlending fee of 1% on both onlending transactions i.e., from \nonlending to ChemChina and from ChemChina to CHC.25 CHC will establish the REF and \ninterest  differential  account  (IDA)  at  CCB  under  the  REF  and  IDA  account  management \nagreement. 26 CCB will execute subloan agreements in a form and on terms and conditions \nacceptable to ADB. The interest rate on subproject loans will be the higher of (i) the interest rate \npayable by ChemChina, or (ii) 90% of the prime rate set by the People\u2019s Bank of China for \ncommercial bank loans with the same terms as the subloans.27 ChemChina will bear the credit \nrisk,28 while CHC and subborrowers will share currency exchange and interest rate fluctuation \nrisks. Fund flow, implementation, and risk sharing arrangements are described in detail in \nsections III and IV of the project administration manual (PAM).29 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  March 2016\u2013February 2021 (estimated)  \nLoan closing date  31 August 2021 \nFinancial intermediary   CCB was selected through a competitive process to act as the onlending bank and \nfinancial intermediary. It will be responsible for (i) providing a guarantee to the Ministry \nof Finance; (ii) onlending ADB loan proceeds; (iii)  managing the REF and an interest \ndifferential account; (iv) executing and implementing subloan agreements with \nsubproject borrowers; (v) managing disbursement, interest payment, and collection of \nprincipal; (vi) facilitating timely reporting to ADB and auditing of Statements of \nUtilization of Funds; (vii) conducting financial due diligence of future subprojects; and \n(viii) making suitable recommendations to the steering committee on subproject \nselection. CCB will provide parallel commercial collaborative cofinancing at its own risk, \nand can make loan pricing and approval decisions freely.  \nExecuting agency  ChemChina will implement the project through CHC, bear the credit risk, onlend loan \nproceeds to CHC, and supervise overall implementation through the steering \ncommittee.  \nImplementing agency  CHC will implement the project through the project implementation unit established at \nHuatai. CHC will exercise supervisory control and provide support to Huatai. Huatai will \n(i) facilitate the implementation of subprojects by helping to prepare quarterly subproject \nreports and withdrawal applications to be submitted to ADB in accordance with the \n                                                \n25  This multilayered onlending structure, which has worked well in previous projects, is an established practice in the \nPRC to provide sovereign guaranteed loans to state-owned enterprises. ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation \nof the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Tianjin Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Power Plant \nProject. Manila. \n26  The tenor of subloans will be adjusted to the subprojects\u2019 payback periods and cash flow characteristics, allowing \nthe rollover of ADB loan proceeds. As funds are onlent at near-commercial terms, a complementary interest \ndifferential account will also need to be established. The interest differential will be partially used (up to 40%) to \ngradually strengthen Huatai\u2019s equity base and increase the financing capacity of the ESCO in the future. \n27  The People\u2019s Bank of China publishes three reference rates: 1 year, up to 5 years, and beyond 5 years. The \napplicable reference rate will depend on the chosen term for a subloan. This proposed subloan lending rate does \nnot provide a significant subsidy over the market rates, but gives subborrowers an incentive to invest in energy \nefficiency. \n28 On the basis of the credit rating and the asset scale of ChemChina, CCB has granted it a credit line of CNY40 \nbillion ($6.5 billion equivalent). The outstanding balance of the $100.0 million ADB loan will be part of this credit line \nas ChemChina\u2019s counter-guarantee for CCB\u2019s guarantee to the Ministry of Finance. No further collateral or \ncharging rights are required by CCB. \n29 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \nAspects   Arrangements \nPAM, (ii) screen and assess future subprojects according to the selection criteria, (iii) \nensure compliance with environmental and social safeguards by implementing an \nenvironmental and social management system, and (iv) coordinate the implementation \nof subprojects as needed. \nSteering committee  ChemChina has formed a steering committee comprising representatives of the \nexecuting agency, CHC, and CCB. The steering committee will review the compliance \nof project implementation with the implementation requirements and endorse \nsubprojects for future batches.  \nImplementing unit  Beijing Zhonghao Huatai Energy Technology, No. 19 Xiaoying Road, Beijing City, \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. A full-time staff of 15 is proposed for the implementing unit. \nFirst batch of  Dezhou Shihua Chemical  for subproject 1, and  \nsubborrowers  Huatai for subproject 2. \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  1 contract  $34.26 million \n  Domestic procedure  24 contracts  $65.44 million \nConsulting services  Consultants\u2019 qualification selection  2 person-months  $0.30 million \nAdvance contracting and  Both subborrowers have requested advance contracting and retroactive financing. \nretroactive financing  Retroactive financing of up to 20% is allowed, provided that the expenses are incurred \n12 months before the signing of the ADB loan agreement. ChemChina and CHC have \nbeen informed that provision of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not \ncommit ADB to financing the subprojects. \nDisbursement   The ADB loan will be disbursed according to the statement of expenditures procedure \nfor financial intermediary loans as defined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2015, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed on between \nthe government and ADB. ADB loan proceeds will be directly disbursed according to \ndefined subloan milestones to the REF and from there to subborrowers of the first batch \nas shown in figure 3 in the PAM.b \nADB  =  Asian  Development Bank,  CCB  =  China  Construction  Bank,  CHC  =  China  Haohua  Chemical  Group, \nChemChina = China National Chemical Group, Huatai = Beijing Zhonghao Huatai Energy Technology, PAM = project \nadministration manual, REF = revolving escrow fund.  \na  The estimated project implementation period will be from 1 March 2016 to 28 February 2031, because repayment \nreflows of the ADB loan proceeds will be reinvested in additional subprojects through the REF. \nb  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2, Figure 3). \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n  \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n22.  The due diligence confirmed that project designs have undergone rigorous and multiple \nevaluations, and will apply conservative designs with redundant safety and control measures to \nmitigate any serious technical failure and risks associated with the technical scale-up of pilot \nprojects. It reviewed pilot test results and assessed first batch subprojects to be technically \nfeasible. It further confirmed (i) projected energy savings, (ii) cost estimates, and (iii) adequacy \nof  implementation  arrangements  and  the  schedule  for  first  batch  subprojects.  It  assessed \ntechnical risks inherent to the scale-up and found them to be manageable. It also found the \nsubborrowers\u2019 capacity in managing technical risks to be adequate, and concluded that the \nassociated technical and implementation risks are medium.30 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  Financial analysis. A financial internal rate of return of 17.0% was computed for the first \nbatch of subprojects combined.31 The first batch of subprojects was found to be financially \nsound under various adverse scenarios, with the financial internal rates of return ranging from \n                                                \n30  Innovative Energy Efficiency and Emission Reduction Technologies (see list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \n6.2% to 15.1%. Future subprojects will need to meet financial performance and creditworthiness \ncriteria for subborrowers acceptable to ADB (footnote 10).  \n \n24.  Economic analysis. An economic internal rate of return of 20.3% was computed for the \nfirst batch of subprojects.32 If the significant environmental benefits from the incineration of \nHFC-23 are taken into account and a carbon price at the low end of observed carbon prices on \nthe PRC\u2019s pilot carbon markets is assumed, the economic internal rate of return is equal to \n41.0%. The analysis shows that HFC-23 destruction in subproject 2 is highly sensitive to the \nassumed carbon price. The project remains viable, with an economic internal rate of return of \n29.0% to 38.1%, under various sensitivity scenarios.   \n \nC.  Governance  \n25.  Financial management assessment. The selected financial intermediary, CCB is the \nsecond largest commercial bank in the world in terms of asset value and has satisfactory \nfinancial management capability to accomplish the assigned tasks (Table 3). The integrity due \ndiligence showed a strong governance system in place at CCB, which is regularly audited by \nrelevant  authorities.  The  potential  risk  arising  from  its  association  with  ADB  is  low.  The \nassessment prepared for ChemChina, CHC, DSC, and Huatai found the financial management \nsystems in place to be adequate to ensure that loan funds are used for the intended purposes.33 \n \n26.  Procurement risk assessment. The assessment showed that CHC has satisfactory \nexperience in procuring contracts of up to $10 million equivalent, following domestic procedures. \nCHC will undertake all procurement under this FIL loan, except for one contract, according to \nthe established domestic commercial practices and procurement procedures of ChemChina, \nwhich  are  aligned  with  the  procurement  laws  of the  PRC  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  In the \nprocurement of one large contract for the supply of towers in the amount of $34.26 million \nequivalent, CHC will comply with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time \nto time) and use international competitive bidding procedures and ADB\u2019s standard bidding \ndocuments. A professional procurement agent will be hired for project implementation. Loan \ndisbursement procedures have been prepared to ensure that subloan disbursement will be \nlinked to the payment of eligible expenses.34 \n \n27.  Corruption prevention. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with ChemChina, CHC, Huatai, CGY, DSC, and CCB. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  The project will have positive social impact by reducing GHG emissions, expediting the \nelimination of mercury use, and expediting the phaseout of mercury mining. It will thus help to \ncurb climate change and lessen the hazardous health effects of mobilizing mercury in the \nenvironment. The project will be implemented in existing facilities, with social impacts confined \nto the boundary of the industrial plants. Low-income households and communities will not \ndirectly  benefit through  poverty  reduction. The  project  will  also  have  no  gender  elements: \ngender equity or the empowerment of women will not be directly promoted. \n                                                \n32  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Financial Management Assessment for the Financial Intermediary; Financial Management Assessment for Project \nEntities (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 Project Procurement Risk Assessment for Project Entities; Project Procurement Risk Assessment for Procurement \nAgent (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  Environment. The project is categorized as FI, and first batch subprojects are classified \nas category A for environment. A project environmental impact assessment (EIA) and due \ndiligence was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).35 The \nEIA was posted on the ADB website on 22 May 2015. Following a detailed assessment, both \nsubprojects were found to (i) exclude activities on ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list; and \n(ii) present  low  climate  change  risk,  since  climate  risks  are  already  incorporated  in  the \nengineering design of the existing facilities and new technologies financed under the project.36 \nThe environmental audit of the existing facilities revealed exemplary management commitment \non the part of CGY, as well as excellent practices in environment and occupational health and \nsafety management. DSC, while well managed, needs to further strengthen its environment and \noccupational  health  and  safety  management  and  practices.  Among  the  corrective  actions \nproposed for DSC in the audit report is the certification of these management systems. The EIA \nof  the  component  subprojects  showed  potential  adverse  impacts  to  be  limited  except  for \n(i) construction  noise  and  dust  during  construction,  (ii)  air  source  emissions  and  fugitive \nemissions, and (iii) the handling of chemicals and hazardous materials during operation. A \ncomprehensive  environmental  management  plan  will  enable  the  subproject  companies  to \nreduce  or  avoid  any  anticipated  impacts.  An  ESMS  will  be  developed  and  adopted  by \nChemChina, CHC, CCB, and Huatai for future subprojects under the project to (i) ensure that \nfuture subproject selection is acceptable to ADB; and (ii) enhance effective environmental and \nsocial management practices, as explained further in the PAM. Potential future subprojects \nclassified under category A for the environment will not be excluded.37 \n \n30.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project is categorized as FI. \nFirst batch subprojects will have no impact on involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \nand ethnic minorities (category C). They will be implemented within the borders of existing \nindustrial facilities and will not entail the acquisition of new land for expansion. Potential future \nsubprojects will be screened in accordance with the ESMS, and those under category A or B for \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples will be excluded. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  There are no outstanding major risks. The identified risks and mitigation measures are \nsummarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and management plan. \nThe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.38 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPoor performance, cost overrun, or  Extensive pilot testing and multiple scale-up of pilots have proved the \nimplementation delay for scale-up  efficacy of the technology.a Third-party verification of test results has \napplication of first-of-its-kind process  also confirmed the soundness of the technology, and the chosen scale-\ntransformation at DSC   up is within technically acceptable limits.

Near-zero fatality and \naccident-free operation of both plants for the past 10 years further attest \nto the soundness of the systems. The ESMS will ensure that similar high \nstandards are applied in future subproject selection. \nRisk of financial losses of Huatai, which  A market survey and business model prepared for Huatai\u2019s business \nmay further weaken its position and  plan indicate Huatai\u2019s large energy efficiency investment needs and \nlessen the effectiveness of project  growth potential.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n32.  The government and ChemChina have assured ADB that the implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and the loan documents. \n \n33.  The government and ChemChina have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and the project agreement. \n \n34.  No withdrawals will be made from the loan account unless, to the satisfaction of ADB, \n(i) the subproject agreements have been duly executed and delivered between CHC, CGY and \nHuatai and between CHC and DSC, (ii) the subloan agreements have been duly executed and \ndelivered between CCB and DSC and between CCB and Huatai, and (iii) the ESMS has been \nestablished in a manner satisfactory to ADB. \n \nV.
