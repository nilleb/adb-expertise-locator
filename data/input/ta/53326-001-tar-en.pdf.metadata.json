THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \n1.  The proposed Bengaluru Metro Rail Project will support the Government of Karnataka \nstate to improve the livability and competitiveness of Bengaluru city by enabling integrated and \nsustainable urban development and rejuvenation of areas along mass transit corridors and by \nproviding safe, affordable, barrier-free, high-quality, multimodal public transport for all. The project \nwill finance (i) the construction of 56 kilometers (km) of new metro rail line and 30 metro stations; \n(ii) the preparation of urban development plans and implementation frameworks based on transit-\noriented development (TOD) principles that facilitate land value creation and capture; and (iii) the \ncreation  of  enabling  infrastructure  and  institutional  provisioning  for  seamless  integration  of \ndifferent modes of public transport to provide efficient, accessible, convenient, and safe mobility \noptions for all commuters. The project will also strengthen institutional structures and build \ncapacities of line agencies and stakeholders at all levels for designing and delivering sustainable \nand comprehensive urban mobility solutions and TOD-based urban development schemes. In \naddition, the project will support formulating a communication strategy and participatory process \nfor TOD implementation and urban mobility solutions. The implementing agencies of the project \nwill be the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) and the Directorate of Urban Land \nTransport (DULT) of the Government of Karnataka state. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  Bengaluru, Karnataka\u2019s state capital, is India's fourth most populous city.1 Spatially, the \ncity\u2019s area has tripled in the last two decades to about 800 square km, making it the fastest \ngrowing major metropolis in the country. The city is India\u2019s fourth largest gross domestic product \ncontributor and is responsible for 11% of the country\u2019s foreign direct investment, next only to Delhi \nand Mumbai. Bengaluru is also expected to be one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing city economies \nduring 2019\u20132035. About 33% of the city\u2019s population is engaged in the secondary sector, with \nthe remaining 67% employed in services. Numerous public sector undertakings, engineering and \nmanufacturing  industries,  software  and  information  technology  (IT),  aerospace, \ntelecommunications, biotechnology, and defense organizations are located in the city. Bengaluru, \nwith one of the youngest and most efficient technology workforces among all global start-up hubs \nand one of the best start-up ecosystems in the world, has emerged as the IT start-up capital of \nIndia and the country\u2019s leading IT exporter, with more than 30% of the national share. \n \n3.  Despite well-documented advantages, rapid urban growth in Bengaluru has not been \nwithout problems arising from urban sprawl, unplanned sporadic development in the absence of \na cohesive vision, and the inability of the city\u2019s infrastructure to keep pace with population growth. \nThis has resulted in problems such as congestion, worsening mobility of people and goods, high \nland prices, crumbling essential infrastructure, and environmental degradation. All of these are \nreportedly reducing productivity, inhibiting the efficiency of the economy and leading to a much \nlarger crisis of consistently declining quality of life.2 \n \n1  United Nations. 2018. The World\u2019s Cities in 2018: Data Booklet, Statistical Papers \u2013 United Nations (Ser. A), \nPopulation and Vital Statistics Report. New York. The estimated current population of Bengaluru Metropolitan Area \n(BMA) is about 12 million. \n2   The Boston Consulting Group. 2018. Unlocking Cities: The Impact of Ridesharing across India. Delhi. Bengaluru \nloses a staggering \u20b9380 billion every year as the social cost of traffic congestion. Bengaluru ranks a low 149 (of 231) \non the 2019 Mercer\u2019s Quality of Living Index. According to a report by TomTom, the Netherlands-based global \nprovider of navigation, traffic, and map products, Bengaluru  is the world\u2019s most traffic-congested city. The average \nspeed on critical roads drops to less than 10 kilometers per hour during peak traffic hours. \n ", "2 \n \n4.  As a strategic response to the above challenges, the state government is orienting the \ncity\u2019s public mass transit system toward more sustainable modes, including the expansion of \nmetro rail, introduction of suburban rail, and the upgrading of public bus transport. Moreover, the \nstate government recognizes the importance of (i) developing integrated urban planning to \nmanage growth, catalyze strategic renewal of the city core, and enhance the competitiveness, \nsustainability, and inclusiveness of the city;3 (ii) creating a ridership base that improves the \neconomic and financial viability of mass transit investments; (iii) ensuring accessibility of basic \nurban services for all city residents; (iv) using land as a revenue source to finance the city\u2019s long-\nterm investment; and (v) addressing complex and intertwined economic and technological needs. \nTo  meet  these  objectives,  the  state  government  is  planning  to  develop  a  new  model  for \nsustainable redevelopment and growth for Bengaluru city, including the proposed mass rapid \ntransit system expansion plan, and has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for the following: \n \n(i)  Transforming Bengaluru through transit-oriented development to realign growth \nand densities along mass transit corridors. The proposed extension of the metro rail \nnetwork will link major hi-tech hubs, new growth areas of the city, and the international \nairport. Stations of the proposed corridor and surrounding areas have significant potential \nto  create  agglomeration  effects,  accommodate  planned  growth,  and  increase  the \neconomic productivity of the city through strategic renewal and densification. The use of \nTOD, a new urban development model, will help achieve the objective by realigning growth \nand densities along these new mass transit corridors and creating higher density, mixed \nuse,  mixed  income,  resource-efficient,  safe,  and  inclusive  neighborhoods  that  are \ndesigned for effective diseases containment and cure, and will reduce the city\u2019s carbon \nfootprint. In addition, this new planning approach will enhance land values along the \ncorridor and generate capital revenues for the city to meet its long-term investment needs. \n \n(ii)  Enabling  a  mobility  shift  in  Bengaluru  toward  low-carbon  modes  through \nmultimodal  integration.  Multimodal  integration  (MMI)  across  four  key  pillars  of \nintegration\u2014physical, information, operational, and institutional\u2014and integrated ticketing, \nwill provide seamless, convenient, and affordable route and mode choices to all citizens. \nThis will make mobility more efficient, safe, affordable, and accessible for all, empowering \nwomen and differently abled persons to move and access opportunities and amenities \nacross  the  city  with  greater  ease  and  confidence.  Overall,  these  people-oriented, \nenvironment-friendly solutions will help alleviate Bengaluru\u2019s mobility challenges and the \nassociated adverse impacts.  \n \n5.  TOD and MMI are quickly gaining ground in India because of the substantial merits they \nbring, but these concepts are complex to plan, design, implement, and manage. The proposed \nTA will support BMRCL and DULT to integrate TOD and MMI into their urban development \nschemes. The TA will also help BMRCL and DULT to incorporate lessons from similar brownfield \nTOD developments and MMI initiatives in the region, and to identify measures to ensure \u201cbuy-in\u201d \nfrom stakeholders and the market to enable urban transformation at the required scale.  \n \n6.  To facilitate the preparation and on-the-ground implementation of the TA and make the \nplanning process demand-driven and evidence-based, ADB is supporting BMRCL and DULT in \nTA preparatory activities, which include (i) setting up a relevant database so that the TA is founded \non high-quality, robust analytics; (ii) formulating an integrated regulatory framework to resolve \n \n3  Studies show that investments in mass rapid transit have the potential to leverage 10 times in economic gains for a \ncity and its surrounding regions.  \n ", "3 \n \nconflicts  among  existing  policies  and  plans and  create  conditions  for  successful  TOD  \nimplementation; (iii) developing pilot concept plans for physical MMI for seven proposed stations \nto demonstrate the tangible benefits of convenient intermodal connections and barrier-free access \nfor all; (iv) devising a strategy for integrated service and financial planning for the city public bus \ntransport agency, to ensure that the readjusted travel demand generated in the context of the \nupgraded mass rapid transit system is met; and (v) organizing sensitization workshops for \ndecision makers and capacity building programs and exposure visits for operational staff of line \nagencies to create conditions of ownership and commitment for a lasting legacy. \n \nB.
