The Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) is rebuilding public financial management \n(PFM)  institutions  and  systems.  These  efforts  are  focused  through  the  Public  Expenditure \nReview  and  Rationalization  Programme  (PERR),  which  comprises  nine  projects,  including \nProject 6, financial management improvement programme (FMIP), and Project 9, for improving \nstatutory authority governance. The PERR is a joint Government-donor program coordinated by \nthe multi-agency PERR implementation committee. Key participating development partners are \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and World Bank.  \n \n2.  During the 2006 Country Programming Mission, the Government requested technical \nassistance  (TA)  from  ADB  to  support  PERR-related  activities.  The  TA  was  included \nsubsequently  in  the  PNG  country  strategy  and  program  2006\u20132010.1 TA  fact-finding  was \nconducted in March 2007 during the joint-donor PERR mission.2 The Government confirmed TA \ngoals, purpose and scope, which are summarized in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The objective of PERR Project 9 is to improve the governance of statutory authorities by \nstrengthening the accountability framework, with the aim of improving expenditure control and \nrealizing  fiscal  savings.  The  proliferation  of  statutory  authorities  in  recent  years  has  been \naccompanied by a trend for less clear roles and responsibilities and less effective national \ngovernment  policy  coordination  and  oversight.  There  are  now  over  200  non-commercial \nstatutory  authorities  and  the  list  is  growing.  As  a  consequence,  governance  issues  have \nemerged,  and  weakened  budgetary  control  has  brought  unchecked  expenditure  growth. \nMoreover, accountability and disclosure requirements are often ignored or inadequate, and \nfinancial  management  information  is  either  unavailable  or  incomplete.  Limited  control  is \nexercised over the administrative and broader operating costs of these agencies, and significant \npublic funds have been inappropriately retained, invested or otherwise misused. As a result, the \nGovernment is less able to allocate resources to priority areas of expenditure.4  \n \n4.  In 2005, the PERR implementation committee requested a review of statutory authority \ngovernance arrangements. The review concluded that (i) the large number and small size of \nstatutory  authorities  undermine  oversight  provided  by  the  Auditor-General\u2019s  Office  and  the \nParliamentary public accounts committee; (ii) the Public Finances (Management) Act (PFMA) \nprovides for assessments of statutory authorities, but these assessments are inadequate; (iii) \nannual budgetary controls and other central controls apply in principle but not in practice; (iv) \nthe  accountability  framework  varies  significantly  among  statutory  authorities;  (v)  PFMA \nregulations do not define clearly the actions to be followed in relation to accountability reports; \nand (vi) statutory authority managers are not held accountable for performance.5 In addition, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010): Papua New Guinea. Manila (approved on 25 July). \n2  Joint ADB, AusAID, and World Bank Mission, 5\u201316 March 2007. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 26 April 2007. \n4  The PNG Medium-Term Development Strategy 2005\u22122010, which has widespread internal and external support, \nidentifies seven expenditure priorities: (i) rehabilitating and maintaining transport infrastructure, (ii) promoting \nincome-earning opportunities, (iii) basic education, (iv) development-oriented informal adult education, (v) primary \nhealthcare, (vi) HIV/AIDS prevention, and (vii) law and justice. \n5  Dean, Peter N. 2005. Improving Fiscal and Governance Oversight of Non-Commercial Statutory Authorities in \nPapua New Guinea. Report to the Public Expenditure Review and Rationalization Implementation Committee. \nSeptember 3. \n ", "2   \nstatutory authorities appear overstaffed, and staff terms and conditions are significantly more \ngenerous than in government departments.  \n \n5.  In response, the review recommended that (i) the PFMA be amended to make it more \nspecifically applicable to statutory authorities, leading to a more finely tuned accountability \nregime; (ii) the PFMA and budget procedures be amended so that public monies received by \nstatutory authorities are paid gross to the consolidated revenue fund and that statutory authority \nexpenditures  be  subject  to  annual  parliamentary  appropriation;  (iii)  an  assessment  of \nmanagement  performance  be  undertaken  as  a  prelude  to  a  risk-based  rationalization  and \nrestructuring of the statutory authority sector; and (iv) punitive action be taken under PFMA \nSection 63(8) against delinquent submitters of reports and financial statements.   \n \n6.  The  objective  of  PERR  Project  6,  or  FMIP,  is  to  implement  best  practice  and \ntransparency in PFM within and among national, provincial, and local governments. The FMIP \nhas contributed significantly to reducing the backlog of provincial government financial reports, \nbut the main FMIP focus at present, through the ADB-supported Financial Management Project \n(FMP),6 is  to  implement  an  integrated  financial  management  system  (IFMS)  in  national \nGovernment  agencies.  The  Government  has  decided  to  refocus  the  FMIP  on  its  broader \nobjectives by developing a medium-term financial management strategy (MTFMS). Terms of \nreference for developing the MTFMS have been finalized, and an MTFMS working group is \nbeing  established.  The  MTFMS  working  group  will  comprise  deputy  secretary-level \nrepresentatives from the departments of National Planning and Monitoring, Treasury, Finance, \nEducation, Health, and Works; Auditor-General\u2019s Office; Public Sector Reform Management \nUnit; and Provincial Administration of Milne Bay Province. \n \n7.  The MTFMS will provide a medium-term framework for PFM reform, which will include \nbuilding  transparency  for  financial  transactions  and  establishing  credible  sanctions  for \nimproperly using public monies. Specifically, the MTFMS scope will cover (i) budget preparation; \n(ii) budget execution; (iii) accounting for all national and subnational agencies; (iv) cash and \nbank  management;  (v)  debt  management;  (vi)  financial  and  performance  reporting  and \nmonitoring, including for statutory authorities and state-owned enterprises; (vii) internal controls \nand audit; and (viii) external scrutiny that includes the Auditor-General\u2019s Office, Parliament and \ncivil society.  \n \n8.  ADB has provided early assistance for MTFMS preparations through small-scale TA \n4829-PNG: Preparing Supplementary Financing for the Financial Management Project.7 This \nhas supported the preparation of a background paper, which will provide important input into the \nMTFMS  development  process.8 The  Government  intends  for  the  MTFMS  to  be  developed \nthrough  a  participatory  process  involving  consultation  with  departmental  secretaries, \nconstitutional  office  holders  (particularly  the  Auditor-General),  stakeholders  (including \ndevelopment partners), and civil society (including media and business leaders). The public \nexpenditure  and  financial  accountability  (PEFA)  performance-measurement  framework  will \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 1999.

The TA will promote good governance through improved transparency, accountability \nand efficiency in managing and using public resources. Specifically, the TA will improve the \nfinancial oversight and governance of statutory authorities, and will support the consultative \npreparation and socialization of the MTFMS. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Statutory  Authorities Component. The TA will support the preparation of a policy \nsubmission to the National Executive Council (NEC), sponsored by the Minister for Treasury. \nThe NEC policy submission will outline proposed amendments to the PFMA and selected \nstatutory authority legislation, with the objective of improving the governance framework for both \nnon-commercial  and  commercial  statutory  authorities,  with  an  immediate  focus  on  non-\ncommercial statutory authorities.  \n \n11.  Specifically,  the  TA  will  (i)  recommend  to  the  national  Government  a  whole-of-\ngovernment framework to enhance the accountability of statutory authorities that is consistent \nwith good international practice and explicitly identifies strategies and incentives to encourage \ncompliance and (ii) prepare, in conjunction with the preparation of the framework, and based on \na preliminary review of the statutory authorities in Appendix 2, an implementation plan for \nTreasury  review  and  agreement.  The  implementation  plan  will  (i)  present  the  approach  to \nprioritizing  the  review  of  an  initial  group  of  statutory  authorities;  (ii)  review  and  suggest \namendments to the PFMA to make it more specifically applicable to statutory authorities and to \nstrengthen oversight arrangements; (iii) review and suggest amendments to the PFMA and \nbudget procedures to improve the remittance of public monies received by statutory authorities \nto the Consolidated Revenue Fund; (iv) review and suggest amendments to the PFMA that will \nrequire statutory authorities to receive annual parliamentary authorization for their expenditure \nbudgets;  (v)  review  and  suggest  amendments  to  the  PFMA  to  improve  performance \nassessments of statutory authorities; (vi) review and suggest amendments to the PFMA to \nimprove the regime for statutory authority financial accountability and management; (vii) review \nthe PFMA and individual statutory authority acts to ensure consistency on matters of financial \nmanagement and good governance; (viii) review and propose amendments to the PFMA and \nother applicable legislation to sharpen penalties and improve processes for applying them for \nthe late or inadequate provision of financial information; and (ix) assess the ability of statutory \nauthorities to comply with the proposed PFMA amendments, including identifying resource \nrequirements and capacity constraints. \n \n12.  The PFMA refers at present to \u201cpublic bodies.\u201d The suggested PFMA amendments will \ndefine more clearly statutory authorities and list those to which the amended law would apply, \nas is the approach taken by the Regulatory Statutory Authorities Act 2004, Appendix 2. The \nproposed statutory authorities to be reviewed are listed under Appendix 2 and are categorized \nwith \u201cA, B, and C\u201d as a possible order of prioritization, subject to the implementation plan \ndeveloped and agreed as part of this TA. The implementation plan will be prepared based on a \npreliminary review of the statutory authorities in Appendix 2.  \n \n ", "4   \n13.  MTFMS Component. In close consultation with the MTFMS working group and sponsor \ngroup, the TA will support the development and socialization of the MTFMS. The main output of \nthe working group will be an agreed MTFMS. This will include (i) a statement of the ultimate \nobjectives of the whole PFM cycle, together with a roadmap showing how these objectives can \nbe achieved over the period of the strategy through appropriate phasing and sequencing of \nactivities; (ii) leadership and management arrangements, including monitoring and oversight; (iii) \nreviews of the PFM responsibilities of institutions and officers at different levels of government; \n(iv)  incentives,  rewards,  and  sanctions  underpinning  these  roles  and  responsibilities;  (v) \nrecommendations  for  changes  to  the  legislative  and  regulatory  frameworks;  (vi) \nrecommendations for developing an information and communications technology infrastructure, \nincluding  ownership  and  maintenance;  (vii)  a  change-management  program  for  MTFMS \nimplementation;  (viii)  consideration  of  human  resource  implications,  including  development \nrequirements  and  an  analysis  of  training  needs;  (ix)  an  analysis  of  risks;  (x)  an  MTFMS \ncommunications and public relations program and dissemination plan; (xi) time-bound action \nplans and indicative costs of strategy implementation; and (xii) monitoring indicators. \n \n14.  The TA will support consultations with the PERR implementation committee, national \nand provincial government agencies, and other stakeholders, including civil society groups and \ndevelopment partners. The TA will also support the preparation of a PEFA PFM assessment, \nwhich will provide the basis for monitoring and evaluating the achievement of MTFMS objectives. \nConsultations will consider existing interventions, such as PERR and other public expenditure \nreviews  or  control  framework  reviews  conducted  jointly  with  stakeholders,  the  Fiscal \nResponsibility Act, the original FMIP overarching plan, and PFM guidance documents from \nother jurisdictions. \n \n15.  The MTFMS will identify overarching PFM objectives and provide a roadmap outlining \nthe intermediate objectives on the way to achieving them. Its scope will be the PFM cycle in \nnational,  provincial,  and  local  governments,  including  budget  preparation  and  execution, \naccounting, cash management, debt management, financial reporting, performance reporting \nand monitoring, internal audit, and external scrutiny by the auditor-general and parliament. The \nMTFMS  will  also  identify  the  potential  constraints,  including  institutional  impediments,  to \nachieving these improvements and suggest ways of overcoming them. It will address how the \nstrategy\u2019s scope fits with other PFM and related reforms, both ongoing and planned, and how \nPFM information can be linked with other performance information. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  TA total cost is estimated at $650,000 equivalent. ADB will provide a grant of $500,000 \nfrom the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, to cover consulting services, \nreport production, and miscellaneous administrative and workshop costs. The Government will \nprovide  the  remaining  $150,000  equivalent  as  in-kind  contributions  to  cover  office \naccommodation and support services (Appendix 3). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Department of Treasury will be the Executing Agency for the statutory authorities\u2019 \ncomponent, and the Department of Finance will be the Executing Agency for the MTFMS \ncomponent. The statutory authorities\u2019 consultants will report to the secretary of the Department \nof Treasury through the deputy secretary, who serves as chair of the PERR implementation \ncommittee.  The  MTFMS  consultants  will  report  to  the  deputy  secretary  of  finance.  The \nDepartment  of  Treasury  is  establishing  a  multi-agency  team  to  work  with  the  statutory \n ", "  5\nauthorities\u2019 consultants, which will comprise representatives from the departments of Treasury, \nFinance, and National Planning and Monitoring, as well as from other agencies. \n \n18.  The statutory authorities component will require international consultants (6 person-\nmonths)  and  national  consultants  (6  person-months)  with  skills  in  legal  and  institutional \narrangements for statutory authorities. The MTFMS component will require an international \nconsultant (5 person-months) and a national consultant (8 person-months) with public financial \nmanagement skills. \n \n19.  All consultants will be selected and engaged as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Appendix 4 \npresents the outline terms of reference for the consulting services. The TA is expected to be \nimplemented over 12 months commencing in July 2007 and finishing in June 2008. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Papua  New  Guinea  for  Support  for  Public  Expenditure  Review  and \nRationalization, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets/  Data Sources/  Assumptions \nIndicators  Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms \n       \nImpact      Assumption \nBetter governance through  \u2022  Public expenditure and  \u2022  Annual/biennial  \u2022  Government \nimproved transparency,  financial accountability (PEFA)  PEFA PFM  remains \naccountability, and  public financial management  assessments.a  committed to \nefficiency in managing and  (PFM) performance indicator    improving \nusing public resources  (PI) 7 (extent of unreported  PFM \n  government operations)  arrangements.\nimproved from C+ in 2006 to B  . \nin 2010.    \n\u2022  PI 9 (oversight of aggregate \nfiscal risk from other public \nsector entities) improved from \nD+ in 2006 to C+ in 2010. \nOutcomes       \nImproved financial  \u2022  Increased receipts from  \u2022  Audited annual  Risk \noversight and governance  statutory authorities to the  reports of  \u2022  Vested \nof statutory authorities  Consolidated Revenue Fund  statutory  interests \n  \u2022  Reduced subsidies to statutory  authorities  successfully \n  authorities  \u2022  Annual budgets  combat \n  and public  suggested \naccounts  legislative \n  amendments. \nAn agreed medium-term  \u2022  Endorsement by the National  \u2022  NEC minutes  Assumption \nfinancial management  Executive Council (NEC)    \u2022  Government \nstrategy (MTFMS) is widely  and \nunderstood and supported.  development \n  partners \nremain \ncommitted to \nthe MTFMS. \nOutputs       \n1.
