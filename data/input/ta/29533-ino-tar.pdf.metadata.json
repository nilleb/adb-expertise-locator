INTRODUCTION\n1. The Government of the Republic of Indonesia has requested the Bank to\nprovide an advisory technical assistance (TA) for capacity building to strengthen the\nproject implementation capacity of the Directorate General of Human Settlements (DGHS)\nfor public-private partnership (PPP) projects in the urban sector. A Fact-Finding Mission\nand a Follow-up Fact- Finding Mission were fielded in August 1996 and March 1997\nrespectively, and discussions were held with Government officials including the National\nDevelopment Planning Agency (BAPPENAS); DGHS of the Ministry of Public Works;\nMinistry of Home Affairs; and local governments. An understanding was reached on the\nobjectives, scope, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements for the TA.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Bank's sectoral strategy, consistent with the urban development\nobjectives of the Government, supports the development of basic urban infrastructure and\nservices to meet the rapidly increasing demand for these services. The Bank strongly\nendorses the Government's efforts to promote increased PPP in the sector to relieve the\npressure on public funds, reduce the backlog of infrastructure investment, and increase\nthe efficiency of local service delivery. Under the current (1994-1999) Five-year\nDevelopment Plan (REPELITA VI), private financing is increasingly recognized as critical\nfor the development of infrastructure. Of the $75 billion projected investment program for\nthe major infrastructure sectors for REPELITA VI, about $21 billion is envisaged to be\nfinanced by private sources. While some progress has been achieved in encouraging\nprivate sector investment in infrastructure provision in sectors such as roads and power, in\nthe other sectors, including water supply and urban services, the progress has been\nlimited. Further, most projects have been awarded after direct negotiations, usually based\non unsolicited proposals.\n3. At the Central Government level, the formulation of urban policies and the\nexecution of urban development programs involves BAPPENAS, DGHS, Ministry of Home\nAffairs and the Ministry of Finance. The sectoral responsibilities of DGHS include water\nsupply, sanitation, drainage, solid waste management, housing, and other municipal\nfacilities. With the decentralization of urban development functions to provincial and local\ngovernments, the role of DGHS is increasingly shifting toward sector development\nplanning and provision of assistance to and supervision of provincial and local\ngovernments, while local governments are responsible for planning and implementing\nlocal urban services.\n4. In recognition of the increased need for PPP in urban development, the\nSubdirectorate of Private Sector and Community Participation Development was\nestablished, consisting of 40 professional staff, to focus on promoting PPP and to assist\nlocal and provincial governments to implement such projects. The Subdirectorate has\ntaken an active role in identifying national water supply projects that can be implemented\nwith the private sector and in assisting local governments to deal with the private sector.\nHowever, no major water supply project with the private sector has yet been completed,\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in September 1995.", "2\nand the Subdirectorate lacks the experience to develop build-operate-transfer\n(BOT)/concession projects using a competitive bidding approach.\n5. To assist the Government in its efforts to promote PPP in the development\nof urban infrastructure and services, the Bank provided TA1 to prepare a program of\ncooperation between the public and private sectors in metropolitan Bandung and\nSemarang.2 The TA assisted the Government to identify urban infrastructure projects that\npresent immediate possibilities for private sector involvement and studied their technical,\nfinancial, and economic viability. With regard to laws and regulations, the TA confirmed\nthat the laws do not prohibit private sector involvement in urban infrastructure, either\ndomestic or foreign. Based on local government investment needs, development priorities,\nand the TA recommendations, four projects were proposed 3 covering three urban sectors\nwith varying levels of investment and using different PPP modalities. Two of the projects\nare being implemented,4 while the remaining two, the BOT bulk water supply project and\nthe build-operate-own (BOO) solid waste transfer station project, are more complex and\nrequire substantial additional preparation.\n6. At TA completion, follow-up assistance in capacity building was\nrecommended in view of the Government's limited experience in implementing projects\nwith the private sector involvement. Furthermore, the TA completion report pointed out (I)\nthe need for strong coordination between all involved parties because of the complex\ninstitutional setup that characterizes the urban sector in Indonesia; and (ii) the need for\nstronger involvement of local governments concerned. Lessons learned from the previous\nTA have been incorporated in the design of the captioned TA. Under the captioned TA, a\ntechnical committee consisting of local government representatives will be established in\nBandung to assist with coordination between local governments and thereby improve\nownership of the TA.\n7. Several international agencies have also been promoting PPP and\nsupporting private capital mobilization for urban investments. The most significant\nassistance is the Private Participation in Urban Services funded by the United States\nAgency for International Development, which has provided assistance to (i) establish a\nlegal and regulatory framework to implement BOT, BOO, and joint public-private\npartnership projects, (ii) strengthen local institutional capacity through training; and (iii)\ndevelop standard documentation. The Private Participation Project has developed the\nProject Life Cycle, which contains sets of procedures for various ways to undertake PPP\nprojects and standard contract BOT concessions. No demonstration projects, however,\nhave yet been implemented. The World Bank has also supported the Government's PPP\nTA No. 2016-INO:P,ivate Sector Development in Urban Development (Bandung and Semarang), for\n$600,000. approved on 14 December 1993.\n2 Bandung Metropolitan area covers Bandung City (kotamadya) and the districts (kabupaten) of\nBandung and Sumedang, while metropolitan Semarang covers both kotamadya and kabupaten\nSemarang.\nThe four projects are (i) bulk water supply for metropolitan Bandung, (ii) unaccounted-for-water\nreduction program for the water supply enterprise of kotamadya Bandung, (iii) solid waste transfer\nstation for metropolitan Bandung, and (iv) bus and truck terminal station for kotarnadya Semarang.\nThe projects are the bus terminal station and the unaccounted for water with private sector\nparticipation.", "3\npolicy. Most recently, the World Bank approved a Second Technical Assistance Project for\nPublic and Private Provision of Infrastructure1 to assist the Government, among others, in:\n(i) developing an updated strategy and suitable frameworks for public-private partnerships;\nand (ii) enhancing program evaluation capability of BAPPENAS and regional planning\nbodies. The TA covers the power, telecommunications and transportation sectors; as well\nas urban infrastructure, village infrastructure and banking lending for infrastructure.\n8. The captioned TA is a logical follow-up activity by the Bank to build the\ncapacity of government agencies involved in the implementation of urban PPP projects,\namong others, in the water supply sector and solid waste sector, and to promote orderly\nprocurement processes, transparency and competition in the selection of project\nsponsors. An orderly procurement process where bidders are selected based on\ntransparent and fair criteria is essential to attract private interests to the urban sector. By\nproviding hands-on experience with actual projects, the TA will strengthen the capacity of\nDGI-IS to implement projects. The TA will use pilot projects through which refinements in\nthe bidding, evaluation of bids, and negotiations can be tested and demonstrated to\nofficials of DGHS. This will facilitate the transfer of such knowledge and facilitate\nimplementation of urban development projects with private sector involvement throughout\nIndonesia.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n9. The objective of the TA is to strengthen the capacity of DGHS and other\nrelated agencies in processing PPP projects in the urban sector and to increase\ntransparency in the selection of project sponsors. Using pilot projects that have been\nidentified arid studied under a previous technical assistance (TA No. 2016-INO), the TA\nwill provide hands-on experience in developing projects with private sector involvement\nand the use of competitive bidding processes. Based on the experience gained with the\npilot projects, the TA will recommend improvements to standard contracts, and bidding\nand evaluation processes that will be adopted for use in future projects in Indonesia.2\nB.\t Scope\n10. The TA will comprise three major components. The first component will\ninvolve review and strengthening, where appropriate, of the technical, financial, economic,\nenvironmental and social analysis of urban projects identified under the Bank's previous\ntechnical assistance (TA No. 2016-INO). The pre-tendering documents will be reviewed\nand revised to ensure consistency with the design and scope of each urban project\nidentified. Institutional arrangements to develop projects with PPP will be proposed. The\nsecond component will involve preparation of bidding documents (including concession,\npurchase, and sale agreements) for the selection of projects sponsors, incorporating best\ninternational practices. It will also advise on the bidder evaluation and negotiation process.\n1\t\nIBRD Technical Assistance Project P-6606-IND, approved on 22 June 1995 for $28 million.\n2\t\nVarious modes of undertaking PPP projects and standard contract documentation were developed\nunder the \"Project Life Cycle\", financed by United States Agency for International Development.", "4\nThe third component will comprise institutionalization of the recommendations and\nexperiences from the pilot projects. The interlinkages between the objectives, scope, and\noutputs are discussed in the Logical Framework in Appendix 1.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n11. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,075,000 equivalent, of which\n$730,000 is the foreign exchange cost and $345,000 equivalent is the local currency cost.\nThe Bank will provide $850,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and\n$120,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by the Bank on a\ngrant basis from the Bank-funded TA Program. The Government will finance the balance\nof the local currency costs, amounting to $225,000 equivalent, which includes provision of\ncounterpart staff, domestic consultants, office facilities, and administrative support.\nDetailed cost estimates and financing arrangements are presented in Appendix 2.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n12. The executing agency for the TA will be DGHS, which will coordinate with\nother ministries and offices in providing input to the consultants. To assist in the\ncoordination with local governments, a technical committee will be setup in Bandung,\ncomprising representatives of the three local governments and chaired by the governor.\nThe Director General of Public Administration and Regional Autonomy (DGPARA) will also\nplay an active role in assisting DGHS in the implementation of the TA, particularly in the\narea of institutional arrangements. DGHS will designate two staff as counterpart staff to\nassist the consultants in the implementation of the TA and one senior staff as coordinator\nof the TA. The local government of Bandung, and DGPARA and BAPPENAS will also\nprovide counterpart staff. The Government will make office accommodations available to\nthe consultants and assist with the provision of such administrative services as the\nconsultants may reasonably require to carry out their services.\n13. It is estimated that a total of about 38 person-months of consultant services\n(22 person-months international and 16 person-months domestic) will be required to\nundertake the TA. The international consultant will have expertise in financial, legal,\ntechnical and administrative aspects of bidding for BOT/concession projects. The domestic\nconsultants will have expertise in institutional, legal, environmental, and social aspects.\nThe consultants will be engaged in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and other arrangements for the engagement of domestic consultants. The\nterms of reference for the consultants are presented in Appendix 3.\n14. To assist in the preparation of the projects and the pre-tendering\ndocuments, DGHS will also engage a team of domestic consultants (47 person-months).\nThey will have suitable financial and technical expertise to review and update, if needed,\nthe technical specifications of the projects and assist the Government in the preparation of\nthe pre-tendering documents, and managing the bidding process. These domestic\nconsultants will be selected in accordance with the Government's standard procedures\nand will have qualifications and experience acceptable to the Bank.", "5\n15. The consultants will submit an inception report, quarterly progress reports,\na draft final report, and a final report. The final report will summarize the bidding\nexperience of the pilot projects and, based on the experience gained, provide\nrecommendations to improve the bidding process and standard documentation. Tripartite\nmeetings will be held between the Government, the Bank, and the consultants to review\nthe inception and draft final reports, following the evaluation of the bidding documents. The\nTA is expected to commence in January 1998 and will be implemented over a period of 19\nmonths.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n16. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the\nRepublic of Indonesia, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $850,000 for\nCapacity Building for Private Sector Participation in Urban Development, and hereby\nreports such action to the Board.", "Appendix 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary\t Targets\t Project Monitoring\t Risks/Assumptions\n______________________________________ ________________________\t Mechanisms\n1.
