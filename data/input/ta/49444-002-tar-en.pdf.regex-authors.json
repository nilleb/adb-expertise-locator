INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help improve the capacity of \nPacific developing member countries (DMCs) to develop and implement projects, with a view of \nenhancing the performance of the Pacific portfolio. The TA will provide support by (i) developing \napproaches for  country-  and/or  region-specific capacity  enhancement (short-  to  long-term), \n(ii) delivering targeted training programs and workshops, (iii) conducting technical audits and \nprocurement reviews, and (iv) providing capacity reinforcement for specific projects.  \n \n2.  The  TA  supports  operational  priority  6  (strengthening  governance  and  institutional \ncapacity) of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Strategy 2030,1 and is included in the regional \noperations business plan for the Pacific, 2020\u20132022.2 The TA will build on a previous ADB \ncapacity development TA, Building Project Implementation Capacities in the Pacific.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Limited capacity environment in the Pacific. Seven of the 14 Pacific DMCs are \nclassified as fragile and conflict-affected situations while the remainder share many of their \ncharacteristics.4 They  have  small  populations  and  limited  capacity,  and  are  dependent  on \ndevelopment partner assistance. As geographically dispersed and isolated countries, they are \nalso vulnerable to climate change, natural hazards, and economic shocks. These features also \nprovide a challenging environment for implementing projects in the Pacific. Limited capacity \nresults in reliance on foreign consultants and workers. Government agencies require support to \nbuild  their  capacity  in  project  planning,  preparation,  and  implementation,  particularly  in \nprocurement, contract management, financial management, social and environmental safeguards, \nproject management, and asset management. Greater effort is required to fill these capacity gaps \nin Pacific island countries.  \n \n4.  Lack of systematic training in developing member countries. The Pacific DMCs \nmainly receive ad hoc project management training provided by development partners in areas \nincluding  procurement,  social  and  environmental  safeguards,  and  financial  management. \nGovernment ownership of training is weak, as this is typically externally provided and not adapted \nto specific country needs. The lack of strategic, structured, and regular capacity building based \non a needs assessment results in few opportunities for government staff to systematically develop \ntheir skills in a sustained manner. Staff turnover of those who have been trained is also an issue. \n \n5.  Innovation is essential. Travel restrictions related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-\n19) pandemic have slowed down implementation of infrastructure development projects because \nof nonavailability or limited availability of supervision consultants in the field and the limited \ncapacity  of  executing  and  implementing  agencies  to monitor  and  control  quality.  This  has \nhighlighted the importance of finding innovative solutions to the challenges faced in the Pacific. \nAdoption of high-level technology (HLT) and innovations in construction methods and materials, \nquality supervision, and management information systems for efficient monitoring, are important \n \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n2  ADB. 2019. Regional Operations Business Plan: Pacific, 2020\u20132022. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance for Building Project Implementation Capacities in the Pacific. (TA 9086-REG). \nManila. https://www.adb.org/projects/49444-001/main  \n4  Countries in fragile and conflict-affected situation are the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall \nIslands, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu. \n \n ", "2 \nto achieve value-for-money in the infrastructure investments. To carry out quality monitoring and \nproject management remotely, innovative measures that employ HLT are needed.  \n \n6.  Poor  efficiency  and  sustainability weaken project  success.  According  to  ADB\u2019s \nIndependent Evaluation Department (IED), the percentage of highly successful or successful \nprojects in Pacific DMCs evaluated during 2010\u20132019 varied from 42% to 71% (3-year moving \naverage.5 The percentage during the three most recent cycles6 are as follows: 53% for 21 projects \n(2015\u20132017), 59% for 17 projects (2016\u20132018), and 42% for 19 projects (2017\u20132019). This data \nmust be understood in light of the fact that the completed projects being evaluated over the 2010\u2013\n2017 period would have been designed around 10 years prior, and so do not necessarily reflect \nthe current Pacific portfolio and the innovations in design and implementation that have occurred \nin the intervening 1\u20132 decades. However, what is significant is that the critical factors contributing \nto low success rates were sustainability and efficiency. The DMCs frequently do not have enough \ninstitutional capacity or financial resources to design, develop, and implement the sustainability \ncomponents such as asset management systems, and operation and maintenance schedules.  \n \n7.  A  number  of  factors  drive  the  efficiency  of  project  implementation. \nProject performance ratings in the first quarter of 2020 rated more than 40% of projects in the \nPacific either \u201cfor attention\u201d or \u201cat risk.\u201d7 Several factors contributed to these ratings, including \nweak  capacity  of  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  underperforming  contractors  and \nconsultants,  absence  of  efficient  monitoring  systems,  and  the  quality  of  projects  at  entry. \nThe 2019 Annual Portfolio Performance Report8 found for the Pacific, 38% of the projects \ncommitted in 2019 were design- or procurement-ready, compared with an ADB-wide average of \n83% design-ready and 50% procurement-ready.9  \n \n8.  Historically, procurement has contributed to implementation delays. About 25% of \nprocurement contract transactions had a processing time of 40 days or less, compared with an \nADB-wide average of 67%. This can be partially attributed to the poor quality of bid documents \nand evaluation reports resulting from the low capacity of executing and implementing agencies. \nEnd-to-end procurement time in 2019 averaged 254 days for contracts of more than $10 million.10 \nThe complex country systems for approvals also add to the delays. However, the average \nimplementation period for projects by ADB\u2019s Pacific Department (PARD) that closed in 2019 was \n5.7 years, below the bank-wide average of 7.1 years, in both cases compared with a designed \naverage implementation period at entry of 4.8 years.   \n \n9.  Understanding of 2017 procurement policy still developing. In 2017, ADB approved \nthe new procurement policy11 and procurement regulations for ADB borrowers. The policy and \nregulations require preparation of procurement plans based on full assessment of the needs and \nobjectives of the borrower and describes the project activities to support them. The scope and \ndetails of the procurement plan take into account, and are proportional to, the relevant market, \nscale, risk, value and country circumstances, including when applicable, situations of urgent need \nof assistance or capacity constraints, and the specific economic, environmental, and social \n \n5  IED. 2020. 2020 Annual Evaluation Review: ADB\u2019s Project Level Self-Evaluation System. Manila: ADB. \n6  These projects were prepared during 2008\u20132014. \n7  Project performance ratings are validated by the regional departments, and data are aggregated by the Procurement, \nPortfolio, and Financial Management Department (PPFD).  \n8  ADB. 2020. 2019 Annual Portfolio Performance Report. Manila. \n9  These statistics are expected to be improved with implementation of project readiness financing actively being \npursued. \n10  End-to-end procurement time is defined as time from advertisement to contract signing. \n11 ADB. 2017. ADB Procurement Policy: Goods, Works, Nonconsulting and Consulting Services. Manila. \n ", "3 \nobjectives of the project. Guidance notes to prepare these strategic procurement plans (SPP) \nwere issued in June 2018. Of projects approved by ADB in 2019 across all DMCs, 67% followed \nthe 2017 procurement framework,12 and a few SPPs were prepared following the published \nguidelines. However, in the Pacific, the longer lead time in project development has meant \napproval of projects using the 2017 policy taking place from late-201913. The 2017 procurement \nframework allows flexibility in the procurement approaches, packaging, procurement methods; \nand emphasizes quality and value for money, but requires that executing and implementing \nagencies have greater procurement capacity  to prudently implement projects with fiduciary \nsafeguards. Financial management is an area of particular capacity constraint. This requires \nsupport for DMCs\u2019 capacity enhancement.   \n \n10.  Lessons learned. In developing this TA, ADB has drawn lessons from past TA projects14 \nand considered the recommendations of corporate reviews. The 2016 review of Medium-Term \nFramework  and  Action  Plan  for  capacity  development 15  committed  to  strengthen  the \nimplementation of the Framework, promote effective HLT options, strengthen the quality-at-entry \nreview process, and pursue capacity development support initiatives. The IED\u2019s 2020 Annual \nEvaluation Review (footnote 5) recommends developing a more explicit and expanded public \nsector management capacity development program in relation to ADB investments, focusing on \nexecuting and implementing agencies, which is the intent of output 1. Complementing this, \nthe 2019 Annual Portfolio Performance Report (footnote 8) recommends tailoring projects and \nprograms to address country-specific training requirements and priorities that can be integrated \ninto institutional development strategies. \n \n11.  Specific lessons that have been incorporated in the TA include: (i) building capacity in \nmanagement for development results must go at the pace of the targeted organization, which can \nrequire longer time periods and flexibility in scheduling; (ii) planning implementation support \nrequires long-term TA commitments to facilitate sustainable change; (iii) a sustained presence by \nADB in Pacific DMCs is essential to provide strong logistical support to ADB field missions, \npromote  local  capacity  building,  and  facilitate  day-to-day  communication;  and  (iv) capacity \ndevelopment support for due diligence, project management, procurement, financial management, \nsafeguards, and contract management is critical to support implementation of projects in the \nPacific. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n12.  Initiatives to improve portfolio performance must target all aspects of the project cycle.16  \nMeasures for improving project performance include: (i) improving project readiness, (ii) providing \nextra layers of due diligence and risk management in projects, (iii) supporting the implementation \nof  the  2017  procurement  framework,  and  (iv)  strengthening  financial  management  and \ninstitutional capacity. The TA will support sustainable capacity enhancement initiatives based on \ncountry-specific  institutional  arrangements,  practices,  and  needs;  long  term-capacity \nreinforcements through consulting support; additional due diligence; and required technical audits \n \n12  The  procurement  framework  consists  of  procurement  policy,  procurement  regulations  to  ADB  Borrowers, \nstaff instructions, and guidance notes. \n13 The 2017 procurement policy applies to the projects for which the concept papers were approved on or after \n1 July 2017. \n14  Previous Project and Portfolio Improvement Initiatives in the Pacific and the Lessons Learned (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n15  ADB. 2007.

Impact and Outcome \n13.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: quality of Pacific portfolio enhanced. The TA \nwill have the following outcome: project development and implementation capacities in the Pacific \nimproved.19  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n14.  Output 1: Strategies for country- and/or region-specific capacity enhancement \n(short-  to  long-term)  developed.  The  TA  will  conduct  country-  and/or  region-specific \nassessments of capacity gaps and develop targeted approaches for capacity enhancements in \nproject  design,  project  implementation,  project  management,  and  financial  management. \nThe assessments will identify capacity gaps, needs, and constraints of major stakeholders and \npotential executing and implementing agencies, including ministries, utilities, local contractors, \nand related industry players. These will inform the development of approaches for short-term and \nmedium-  to  long-term  capacity  building  of  Pacific  DMCs  to  be  supported  under  output  2. \nThe approaches  can  include  developing  accreditation  systems  in  procurement,  project \nmanagement, and financial management; and exploring partnerships with regional institutions. \n  \n15.  Output 2: Training programs and/or workshops delivered. Based on the results of \nassessments in output 1, training and workshops will be delivered to DMCs on developing and \nmanaging projects, including financial management to address identified issues. The topics and \nparticipants will depend on the results of the assessments produced under output 1. The TA also \nsupports development of training material and resource persons. Workshops will be conducted \non the implementation of ADB\u2019s 2017 procurement framework and SPP. These will be project-\nbased and supported by sector, country, or subregion industry assessments. The workshops will \nbe  undertaken  at  the  project  preparation  and  implementation  stages.  The participants  will \ncomprise the staff of executing and implementing agencies. Online training modules will be \ndeveloped, and online training will be conducted where appropriate. \n \n16.  Output 3: Technical audits and procurement reviews conducted. The TA will conduct \nannual technical audits and procurement reviews of selected complex projects in PARD\u2019s portfolio, \nincluding for project readiness financing, to facilitate timely intervention and improvements in \nproject implementation and ongoing and future related project design. The reviews will also help \nthe executing and implementing agencies in revising the procurement plans to be fit-for-purpose \nprocurement  approaches.  The  technical  audits  refer  to  all  aspects  of  project  design  and \nimplementation, and address the constraints or delays a project is facing. \n \n17.  Output 4: Capacity reinforcement for specific projects provided. This output will \nsupport capacity reinforcements by specialists to address specific issues that arise during project \nimplementation in key areas such as project management, procurement, contract management, \nuse of HLT, and financial management. This support will not duplicate consulting services \nembedded in the scope of outputs 1\u20133, but will provide targeted interventions to address, \n \n17  Technical audits review a project\u2019s design features, efficiency, challenges, and constraints to further strengthen \nand/or revise project components and implementation arrangements to achieve the intended outputs and outcomes. \n18 The TA on Sustainable Capacity Development for Safeguard in Pacific is expected to be approved in 2020. \n19 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "5 \nfor instance, troubleshooting or on-the-job training. Focused support to \u201cat-risk\u201d projects will be \nprovided to improve the performance to \u201con-track.\u201d \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $5,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($3,685,000 TASF 6 and $1,315,000 TASF-other sources). \nThe key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. The governments of participating DMCs will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of country data, counterpart staff (if needed), meeting \nrooms  as  required  for  consultants,  and  other  in-kind  contributions  as  agreed  during  TA \nimplementation. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency.  PARD  will  be  the  implementing  agency. \nPARD\u2019s Portfolio, Results, and Quality Control Unit will serve as the principal focal point for the \nTA administration, responsible for the recruitment, supervision, and management of consultants \nas well as monitoring and evaluation of the outputs. The implementation arrangements are \nsummarized in the following table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative  December 2020\u2013December 2025 \nimplementation period \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank  \nImplementing agency  PARD/PAOD-PRQ \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB (the executing agency) \n  Firm: QCBS 90:10  Needs assessment and developing country/  $0.80 million \nregion specific capacity enhancement strategies  \n  Individual selection   Targeted capacity reinforcement and strategic  $1.00 million \n(for procurement  interventions in procurement, contract \nconsultants, PPFD  management, project management, financial \nframework agreement  management, and high-level technology \nwill be used)   initiatives \n  Individual framework  For targeted trainings  $0.70 million \ncontracts: consultant \nor resource persons  \n  Firm: QCBS 90:10  Developing strategies for establishment of  $0.50 million \nmanagement information systems in DMCs \n  Firm: CQS  Strategies for local construction and consulting  $0.50 million \nindustry development \n  Firm: CQS  Conducting technical audits   $0.50 million \n(framework contract) \nProcurement  Procurement will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank; CQS = consultants qualification selection; DMC = developing member country; \nPAOD-PRQ  =  Portfolio,  Results,  and  Quality  Control  Unit,  Pacific  Department;  PARD  =  Pacific  Department; \nPPFD = Procurement, Portfolio, and Financial Management Department; QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection; \nTA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n20.  Consulting  services.  The  TA  will  require  an  estimated  145  person-months  of \ninternational and 135 person-months of national and regional consulting services. ADB will \nengage the consultants in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from \n ", "6 \ntime to time) and its associated staff instructions.20 The Procurement, Portfolio, and Financial \nManagement Department (PPFD) Framework Agreement21 of procurement consultants will be \nused for individual consultants recruitment, where appropriate, with the concurrence of PPFD. \nFirms will be selected using the (i) quality- and cost-based selection method with a 90:10 quality-\ncost ratio to ensure quality of the complex scope, through a simplified technical proposal; and \n(ii) consultant  qualification  selection  method  for  technical  audits  and  procurement  reviews. \nOutput-based and/or framework contracts will be considered for consulting services, where \nappropriate, with the concurrence of PPFD. Where possible, the use of fixed out-of-pocket \nexpenses will be considered for administrative efficiency and to simplify the disbursement process.  \n \n21.  ADB will procure nonconsulting services following the procurement staff instructions for \nstaff undertaking procurement of goods, works, and services under ADB-administered TA. \n \n22.  The TA consultants will develop a management information and tracking system to record, \nmanage, and track the activities and results of the TA project. Inputs will be coordinated with other \ndevelopment partners in the region to ensure complementarity, prevent duplication of efforts, and \nensure consistent approaches to achieving long-term sustainability. \n \n23.  Coronavirus disease situation. With travel restrictions related to the pandemic expected \nto continue into the first half of 2021, the inputs of international consultants on the field will be \nconstrained, posing challenges to TA implementation. Some of the measures to be taken to \novercome these constraints include the involvement of the Pacific country offices, recruitment of \nnational and/or regional consultants where appropriate, pairing remotely the national consultants \nwith international consultants, and increased use of information and communication technology \nin TA implementation such as online missions, online training, and webinars.  \n \nE.  Governance \n24.  The procurement risk is minimal since ADB will lead the consultant recruitment. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $5,000,000 on a grant basis for \nEnhancing Quality Portfolio Performance in the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n20 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n21  Framework Agreement # 100008 in consultant management system (CMS). \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact(s) the TA is Aligned with \nQuality of Pacific portfolio enhanced (ADB Strategy 2030 operational priority 6) a \n \nData Sources and \nReporting  Risks and Critical \nResults Chain  Performance Indicators  Mechanisms  Assumptions \nOutcome       \nProject  a.
