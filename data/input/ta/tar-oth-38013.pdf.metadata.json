The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is working together with the nations of Southeast \nAsia1 to prepare a regional cooperation strategy and program (RCSP). The work entails three \nmain challenges.  First, the strategy must be built on a foundation of rigorous analysis of the \npotential gains from regional cooperation. Economic analysis is needed to identify the specific \nsectors and projects in which transnational approaches add the most value.   Second, the role \nof ADB in supporting regional cooperation needs to be clearly defined, based on ADB\u2019s ability to \nadd value to the structures and initiatives that are already in place.  Third, the strategy must be \nbuilt around concrete interventions aimed at two key goals: building regional competitiveness to \nestablish a foundation for sustainable economic growth, and reducing poverty in the region, \nparticularly in areas that are distant from national centers.  On various occasions since 2003, \nthe key underpinnings of the envisaged strategy have been discussed with the governments \nthat will be involved in the RCSP.  During these discussions it was agreed that extensive \nconsultations be held during the preparation and implementation of the new strategy to receive \nneeded inputs and to confirm counterpart commitment.  To accelerate the preparation of the \nstrategy,  ADB  proposes  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  provide  the  most  current  analytical \nassessment of a number of possible themes of the strategy and to support the consultation \nprocess, including a high-level forum on regional cooperation in Southeast Asia.2   \nII.  ISSUES  \n2.  The nations of Southeast Asia are linked by a distinct geography and by a dramatic \neconomic history, including the severe financial crisis in 1997.  During the last decade, a broad \nawareness of common economic and social challenges has fuelled an increasing number of \nmajor cooperation initiatives at regional, subregional, and bilateral levels.  Most recently, the \nsummit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), held in October 2003 in Bali, \nIndonesia, called for the establishment of an ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2020.3  \n3.  ASEAN envisages the AEC as a single market and production base, to firmly establish \nSoutheast  Asia  as  a  dynamic  competitor  in  the  world  economy.  A  recent  ASEAN \ncompetitiveness study4 concluded that the greatest obstacle to competitiveness in the region is \nthe fragmentation of the market, which sharply increases the cost of doing business in the \nregion and deters foreign direct investment.  To overcome this fragmentation and realize the \nambitious AEC vision, the nations of the region will have to surmount a number of obstacles. \nAmong the most difficult of these are the infrastructure challenges posed by its archipelagic \ngeography.    This  unusual  landscape  requires  integrated  planning  of  transport  and  energy \ninfrastructure, as many areas are far more easily linked to other nations than they are to their \nown national centers.  Infrastructure issues are especially serious barriers to development in the \npoorer, border islands of Indonesia and the Philippines, and in Sarawak and Sabah in Malaysia.  \n                                                 \n1 Currently, the Southeast Asia Regional Department covers ADB operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and \nSingapore, four of the five founding members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Although not \nan ADB member, Brunei Darussalam is also included in this TA, as it is a member of the Brunei Darussalam, \nIndonesia, Malaysia, Philippines\u2013East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA), a subregional cooperation initiative. \n2 The TA was listed in Asian Development Bank Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 23 January 2004. The \nTA is not included in the list of planned subregional TAs in ADB. 2002. Subregional Cooperation Strategy and \nProgram Status Report: Southeast Asia.

", "2 \n \n4.  Transport has long been a focus in regional cooperation in Southeast Asia, as reflected \nin the initiatives of the ASEAN transportation network. In the recent ASEAN Summit in October \n2003,  the  need  to  further  develop  land,  air,  and  sea  linkages  was  again  emphasized,  in \nanticipation of greater cross-border movement of goods and services with the implementation of \nASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and other ASEAN+3 initiatives.  An integrated approach to \ntransport development in the region, based on analysis and projections of regional demand for \ntransport services under different scenarios and on a study of the alternative options for meeting \nthat demand, is required to ensure that investments are prioritized correctly.  \n5.  Energy sector development to meet the rapidly growing demand in Southeast Asia also \nrequires integrated planning, as efficient resource development necessitates a regional, not \nlocal, perspective. This is particularly significant in the context of the regional integration effort in \nthe electricity and gas sectors, as highlighted in the ASEAN Power Grid (APG) and the Trans \nASEAN Gas Pipeline (TAGP) programs and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) \nAsian Gas Grid program.  A recent study by the Institute of Energy Economics of Japan projects \nthat energy consumption in Asia will increase annually by 3.8%, and the gas share of this \ngrowing amount will increase from the current 7% to 14% by 2010.5 A new strategy for regional \ncooperation in Southeast Asia will have to place a high priority on helping individual nations \ndevelop their energy sectors in a more coordinated and synchronized way. \n6.  To help meet these and other challenges ADB is currently working with the concerned \nstakeholders to formulate its first RCSP for Southeast Asia.  ADB\u2019s efforts will review and \nselectively build on, streamline, and integrate past and ongoing assistance activities in the \nregion, including investments in infrastructure development and TA activities in support of the \nBrunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines-East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-\nEAGA).  Such an effort will advance the core development themes of the AEC to make ASEAN \na more dynamic and competitive segment of the global supply chain.  While the East ASEAN \nGrowth Area is expected to be one key area of new activities, this strategy is expected to review \nand reformulate ADB assistance in that region in the context of overall regional cooperation \nopportunities in Southeast Asia. \n7.  ADB  has  already  consulted  with  key  international  organizations  that  are  supporting \nSoutheast Asian integration, most importantly with the ASEAN Secretariat6 and with United \nNations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP)7, to ensure that \nthe Southeast Asia RCSP will complement and reinforce ongoing ASEAN initiatives.  The \ndeveloping member countries involved in the RCSP have also expressed support for its main \nobjectives and, most importantly, for the choice of strengthened infrastructure linkages as the \nmain focus of assistance. \n \n8.  The TA will accelerate the shift from dialogue to concrete action in support of these \ngoals.  The TA will finance preparation of action plans for development of the transport and \nenergy sector in the region, rooted in updated projections of supply and demand in these critical \nsectors.  At the decision-making level, a high-level forum envisaged in the TA will identify and \nprioritize strategic objectives in regional cooperation initiatives. At the working level, sector-\n                                                 \n5 Ito, K., et al. 2001.

ADB staff held further discussions with the ASEAN Secretariat on 20\u221226 April \n2004. \n7 Ms. Akhtar met with UNESCAP in Bangkok on 5 February 2004. ", "  3\nfocused consultations will be conducted to help identify, prepare, and implement key regional \nprojects in the priority sectors of transport and energy. The TA findings at both decision-making \nand working levels will provide the basis for the new ADB RCSP for Southeast Asia, which is \nexpected to be completed in late 2004.  Findings of a previous TA to BIMP-EAGA will not be \nduplicated,  but  will  be  utilized  whenever  appropriate.  The  new  TA  aims  to  facilitate  the \nincorporation of those findings into a results-oriented strategy.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The TA aims to support background analytical work and stakeholder consultations for \npreparation of the Southeast Asia Regional Department (SERD) RCSP.   \n10.  The  main  TA  outputs  are  (i)  expert  studies  in  transport  and  energy  development, \nproviding up-to-date analysis and projecting key trends in regional infrastructure demand and \nsupply;  and  (ii)  regional  cooperation  projects  and  programs  identified  through  in-country \nconsultations on priority sectors.  The findings will be presented at a high-level forum to identify \nemerging challenges and opportunities for regional cooperation in the region. \n11.  The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The following methodologies and activities are envisaged for the TA with respect to the \nthree interrelated components. \n13.  Expert  Studies  and  Action  Plans  on  Regional  Cooperation  Approaches  in \nTransport  and  Energy  Development.    The  TA  will  finance  the  preparation  of  expert \nassessments  and  action  plans  on  supply-and-demand  trends  in  transport  and  energy \ninfrastructure in the region, and on the potential for and constraints to regional cooperation in \nthese areas. The assessment will be the basis for the policy dialogue between ADB and the \nstakeholders, and provide inputs to the high-level forum.    \n14.  Regional  Cooperation  Projects  and  Programs.    The  TA  will  support  in-country \nconsultation activities, including sector workshops in transport and energy, to develop priority \nprojects in strategic sectors in the next 3-5 years.  \n15.  High-Level Forum for Regional Cooperation.  The TA will organize and finance a \nhigh-level  forum  at  ADB  headquarters  in  Manila,  to  produce  substantive  and  relevant \nrecommendations for policy makers who will be ADB\u2019s key partners in implementing the RCSP. \nThe forum will invite senior-level (ministerial-rank) policy makers, development practitioners, \nand academic researchers as resource persons. Topics at the forum will include (i) in-depth \ndiscussion of the energy and transport action plans, and the first steps in launching them; (ii) \nbroad review of development challenges and opportunities in Southeast Asia through regional \ncooperation in the context of realization of the AEC in 2020. \n16.  The TA will cover Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Singapore. \nAlthough Brunei Darussalam is not currently an ADB member, it is included in the TA, as its ", "4 \n \nparticipation is essential for the TA objective of promoting regional cooperation in Southeast \nAsia.8 A no-objection letter from each of the participating DMCs will be obtained before the TA is \ncarried out in each of the DMCs.  \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n17.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $370,000  equivalent,  of  which  $350,000  is  in  foreign \nexchange and $20,000 equivalent is in local currency. ADB will finance the entire foreign \nexchange cost on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA will cover the costs of \nengaging consulting services (remuneration, per diem, and travel) and preparing reports. The \nTA  will  also  finance  regional  consultation  including  a  high-level  forum  and  in-country \nconsultation activities, expert studies of priority sectors, and dissemination of major TA output. \nAs it is currently not an ADB member, Brunei Darussalam will finance all direct local costs that \ncould be incurred by that country in implementing the TA. Brunei Darussalam will provide an \nestimated $20,000 equivalent in the form of office space, staff support, conference participation, \nand other in-kind contributions.9 The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix \n2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB (SERD) will be the Executing Agency for the TA. With the assistance of a team of \nconsultants,  ADB  staff  will  work  with  government  agencies  and  business  communities  in \nimplementing the TA. Implementation will take 6 months beginning in April 2004 and ending in \nSeptember 2004. The TA requires two international consultants (6 person-months) and one \ndomestic consultant (5 person-months). The terms of references for consultants are in Appendix \n3. ADB will recruit the consultant team individually in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \nPolicy dialogue and consultation will be carried out with public institutions, the private sector, \nand other aid agencies. Government agencies concerned will provide logistic convenience and \nsupport  including  liaison  with  the  consultant  team  and  assistance  in  accessing  required \ninformation and data. All procurement of equipment and materials, and service payments under \nthe TA will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n19.  The consultants will undertake their assignments intermittently during the TA period. The \ndraft sector study report should be completed by June 2004, and the final TA report by the end \nof August 2004. In view of the time constraint, advance action in recruiting consultants is \nrequired to ensure timely completion of the TA. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis for \nSupport to Strategize Regional Cooperation in Southeast Asia, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n                                                 \n8  Although Brunei Darussalam is not an ADB member, it is a member of BIMP-EAGA subregional cooperation \nprogram, which remains a key part of overall strategic concerns in supporting regional cooperation in Southeast \nAsia. \n9  No financial and other support, which originated from the TASF, will be provided to conference participants from \nBrunei Darussalam and procurement of goods and services will only be limited to ADB\u2019s member countries.
