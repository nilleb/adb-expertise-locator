Program preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is required to prepare the proposed \nResults Based Lending (RBL) Program to support the industrial energy efficiency improvement \nin Shaanxi Province under the 13th Five-Year Plan. The PPTA will be conducted in two phases. \nPhase 1 of the PPTA will (i) confirm the need for proposed financing platform and RBL as the \nmost appropriate lending modality, (ii) define the RBL program scope and program boundary, \nand (iii) recommend the appropriate institutional arrangements to ensure fiduciary oversight and \nsafeguard compliance. Phase 2 of the PPTA will (i) undertake the fiduciary, safeguard, and \nprogram  soundness  assessments  of  the  RBL  program,  (ii)  due  diligence  on  legal  and \ninstitutional  arrangements,  (iii)  detailed  design  of  the  RBL  program  including  the  results \nframework and disbursement linked indicators (DLI), (iv) preparing program action plan and \nprogram implementation guidelines, and (v) identifying capacity building needs of the program \nimplementing agencies and participating financial institutes.     \n \n2.  Given the highly specialized nature of expertise required and the limited availability of \nconsultants with prior experience in preparing a RBL program, a team of consultants will be \nrecruited as individual consultants.
