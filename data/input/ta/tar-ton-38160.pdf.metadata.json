An Asian Development Bank (ADB) reconnaissance mission in \nJune 2004 confirmed the need to address both planning and management systems as well as \ninfrastructure enhancements.1 The Government and ADB preliminarily agreed on a phased \napproach  to  allow  participatory  assessment  and  development  of  an  appropriate  urban \nmanagement  plan  and  identify  priority  areas  for  physical  improvements.  Subsequent  ADB \nconsultation missions confirmed the requests and the phased approach, which resulted in the \nreprogramming of an advisory technical assistance (TA) and a project preparatory TA into a \nsingle TA. A TA fact-finding mission was undertaken from 26 May to 3 June 2005. The Fact-\nFinding Mission reached understanding with the Government on the TA scope, objectives, \nimplementation,  and  financing  arrangements.  The  proposed  TA  is  consistent  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Strategic  Development  Plan  7  (SDP7)2  for  2001\u20132003  and  ADB\u2019s  country \nstrategy for Tonga, particularly its strategy to provide assistance through targeted interventions \nto address the emerging deterioration in some social indicators.3 The TA directly supports the \nPacific Strategy\u2019s key result areas for improving the supply of, and demand for, quality basic \nsocial services and promoting effective development processes.4 The TA concept paper was \napproved in July 2004. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The  Kingdom  of  Tonga  consists  of  five  main  island  groups:  Eua,  Ha\u2019apai,  Niua, \nTongatapu, and Vava\u2019u. Migration is increasing from the outer islands to the urban area of \nNuku\u2019alofa,  the  capital  on  Tongatapu.  Urbanization  is  driven  largely  by  the  desire  for \nemployment, education, health services, and other basic services. Based on projections from \nthe 1996 census, Tonga has a total population of 102,370, of whom more than 65% live on the \nmain island of Tongatapu. Of the Tongatapu dwellers, one third (approximately 25% of the total \nnational population) live in the Nuku\u2019alofa urban area.5 An urbanization rate of 0.8% per annum \nversus 0.6% population overall population increase was observed in the last intercensal period. \nThese statistics may underestimate the rate of urbanization since most current observations \nsuggest that the urban population is increasing more rapidly.  In any event, a growing population \nresulting from both natural increases and rural-urban migration is straining the resources of the \nurban centers and creating social, environmental, health, and economic problems. Increasingly, \nmarginal and poor land is being used for housing and other development activities. The lack of a \nsystematic  and  comprehensive  urban  planning  and  management  system  exacerbates  the \nproblem. Sensitive yet key issues that will need to be considered include the land tenure system \nand individual rights to undertake activities on their own property with no formalized system for \ngovernment acquisition for the social good. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 28 April 2005 as \u201cIntegrated Urban \nDevelopment Project.\u201d \n2  SDP8, which covers the current planning period, is being developed. \n3  ADB. 2004. Country and Strategy Program Update (2005\u20132006): Tonga. The CSPU focuses on (i) continuing \nassistance to the reform program to enhance efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector; (ii) addressing the \nemerging deterioration in some social indicators through targeted interventions; and (iii) improving the policy \nenvironment, market information services, and physical facilities to support smallholders and agribusinesses. \nCSPU 2005\u20132007 is currently being prepared. \n4  ADB. 2004. Responding to the Priorities of the Poor: A Pacific Strategy for the Asian Development Bank 2005\u2013\n2009. Manila. The three strategic objectives are (i) support a conducive environment for private sector; (ii) enhance \nthe supply of, and demand for, quality basic social services; and (iii) promote effective development processes. \n5  Government of Tonga. 1996. Demographic Analysis: Summary and Population Projections. Nukua'lofa, Tonga.   \n ", " 2   \n3.  The Constitution of Tonga provides for Government allocation of land to every adult \nmale citizen in both the town and rural areas (\u201cbush allotment\u201d). With growing urbanization, it \nhas become increasingly difficult for the Government to meet this obligation; and when it does, it \noften must involve marginal land. As a result, many people in Nuku\u2019alofa resort to living in low-\nlying  areas  unsuitable  for  housing.  In  some  cases,  informal  settlement  is  occurring  either \nthrough  formal  landowner  permission,  sharing  of  property  among  relatives,  or  landowner \ninformal permission for settlement. The quality of housing in low-lying areas varies dramatically. \nSome people with reasonable income earnings manage to save and build quality, structurally \nsound homes with adequate sanitation and filling of land to reduce flooding. Others can afford \nonly the most basic of housing and substandard sanitation facilities. Appendix 2 provides the \ninitial poverty and social assessment. \n \n4.  Even though access to safe water is widespread, social services in low-lying areas \nrequire  urgent  attention.6  Sanitation,  drainage,  roads,  and  waste  disposal  likewise  need \nattention.7 Even if sanitation facilities are built to code, geologic conditions in low-lying areas are \nnot  likely  to  allow  adequate  treatment;  thus  groundwater  and  surface  water  may  be \ncontaminated. Many of the environmental health concerns are based on visual and olfactory \nevidence and qualitative perceptions of health professionals; thus, specific data need to be \ncollected in the project area. \n \n5.  Commercial  activities  are  also  affected  by  flooding  in  low-lying  areas.  While  never \nquantified, business losses are evident as stocks have been damaged by flooding and access \nto businesses hampered by flooded roads in the main town area of Nuku\u2019alofa as well as in the \nlowest areas. The lack of adequately planned infrastructure also constrains commercial activity, \ne.g., traffic congestion due to narrow roads and lack of parking facilities. \n \n6.  In smaller urban centers of the outer island groups, the situation is not severe. Still, \nmany stakeholders agree that it is appropriate to initiate urban planning before serious problems \ndevelop. For example, in Neiafu, in Vava\u2019u, road capacity and erosion on steep slopes have \nbeen  noted  as  concerns.  Tourism  being  the  dominant  economic  sector  in  Vava\u2019u,  quality \ninfrastructure is important. \n \n7.  Currently, no government agency is responsible for planning, financing, and providing \nurban infrastructure support services including those relating to water and sanitation. Various \ndepartments have roles in individual aspects of planning and management. The Government\u2019s \nCentral Planning Department (CPD) was established in 1976 with the mandate to coordinate all \ndevelopment  assistance  into  Tonga.8  In  addition,  CPD  is  responsible  for  developing  the \nGovernment\u2019s national plan and providing policy advice on all matters pertaining to social and \neconomic development. The Tonga Water Board is responsible for providing potable water to \nthe urban areas. The Ministry of Works (MOW) is responsible for processing building permits \nand assistance with civil works for roads and drainage. The Ministry of Health is responsible for \nreviewing building designs for compliance with sanitation requirements and currently for the \ncollection of solid waste.9 The Ministry of Lands and Survey is responsible for mapping and \nassigning land allocations. The lack of specific institutional arrangements for urban planning  \nand management directly leads to the current ad hoc approach to urban development.  \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2004. Priorities of the People: Hardship in Tonga. Manila. \n7 The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) has an ongoing solid waste management project, \nthe Tonga Solid Waste Management Project, that is making major improvements in this area through the \nconstruction of an engineered sanitary landfill, improvements to the waste collection systems, and community \nawareness programs. \n8  This role was recently transferred to the Ministry of Finance. \n9  The arrangement for solid waste collection is under review and may be transferred to MOW. \n ", "  3\n \n8.  Responses of donor agencies to assist Tonga in managing urban development vary, \nwith  the  mainstream  response  being  the  focus  on  strengthening  and  supporting  individual \ncomponents of urban development such as health, water, sewage, and education. Much of the \nassistance is directed to the rural areas, though there are small community-based initiatives \nundertaken in urban areas for such things as water tanks and localized filling of land. The \nlargest  urban  intervention  has  been  the  aforementioned  AusAID  solid  waste  management \nproject (footnote 9).  \n \n9.  A comprehensive strategy for urban planning and management is necessary to identify \npriority areas for investment, in terms of both types of physical improvements and specific \ngeographic areas, and ensure that such investments contribute to a focused medium- to long-\nterm  plan  for  urban  development  in  Tonga.  Physical  improvements  in  low-lying  areas  will \nimprove  living  conditions  and  also  provide  the  opportunity  to  demonstrate  the  value  of  a \ncomprehensive approach. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n10.  The proposed TA will undertake a participatory process to address the current ad hoc \napproach to urban management by developing an urban planning and management strategy \n(UPMS) for Tonga. An investment project for integrated urban development in priority low-lying \nareas  identified  by  the  UPMS\u2014which  will  improve  living  conditions  in  Nuku\u2019alofa\u2014will  be \nprepared.  The  UPMS  will  cover  all  relevant  aspects  of  urban  planning  and  management, \nincluding, but not limited to, physical planning, institutional arrangements, policy and legislation \n(e.g., for building and planning regulation, land and resource rights, institutional mandates, etc.), \ncapacity building needs, public participation, and community awareness. Priority low-lying areas \nfor investment will be determined by poor or declining living conditions, potential to support job \ncreation and economic growth, and other factors as may be agreed upon in the participatory \napproach to the UPMS.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact of the TA will be sustainable urban planning and management for Tonga, \nwith improvement in living conditions in low-lying areas of Nuku\u2019alofa. The outcome will be a \nproject design suitable for ADB financing. Key outputs that will support the intended impact and \noutcome are (i) a detailed UPMS for Tonga that addresses institutional arrangements and \nresource needs (e.g., funding, human resources, and capacity building), and includes an action \nplan to achieve improvements; and (ii) a feasibility study for an integrated urban development \nproject in Nuku\u2019alofa.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will be divided into two phases. Phase 1 will include development of the UPMS \nand a conceptual design for an integrated urban development project.10 Phase 2 will develop \nthe  conceptual  design  to  a  level  of  detail  to  allow  completion  of  a  feasibility  study  and \npreparation for ADB financing that also will be completed during phase 2. As the finalization of \nthe UPMS and its endorsement by the Government will require extended consultations and \nparticipatory processes, phase 2 will be initiated as soon as the conceptual design is agreed \nupon, while phase 1 activities to finalize the UPMS continue. The terms of reference (TOR) and \ninputs for the consultants in phase 2 will be refined based on the project components identified \nin the conceptual design.  \n                                                 \n10  Phase 1: October 2005\u2013April 2006; Phase 2: April 2006\u2013November 2006.  \n ", " 4   \n \n13.  The  first  step  in  the  participatory  process  is  confirming  the  identification  of  key \nstakeholders to ensure a participatory process for the TA. Urban development constraints and \nopportunities  will  be  assessed  through  various  workshops,  focus  group  discussions,  and \nsurveys supported by expert reviews.   \n \n14.  To support the discussions and decision making for the UPMS, consultants will complete \na review of urbanization issues affecting Tonga as a whole, and Nuku\u2019alofa and smaller urban \ncenters  in  the  outer  islands  groups.  The  review  will  cover  physical  conditions,  access  to \nservices, existing policies, institutional and legal arrangements, human resources, and funding \nfor urban planning and management and development. They will also review available data to \nsupport  planning  decisions,  e.g.,  maps  and  surveys,  social  indicators,  environmental  data, \neconomic development indicators, etc.  \n \n15.  The consultants will research and identify examples of UPMS from other small island \nstates and similar small economies. From the review and research they will identify a suite of \noptions for improving the existing mechanisms for urban planning and management, citing \nadvantages  and  disadvantages  of  various  approaches.  The  reviews  will  be  supported  by \nsurveys  and  community  discussions.  The  consultants  will  be  assisted  by  one  or  more \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) in undertaking the surveys and community discussions. \nCommunity awareness programs about the project and type of community involvement for \nurban planning and management needs will also be undertaken. \n \n16.  Using  the  completed  reviews  and  feedback  from  the  participatory  process,  the \nconsultants will draft the UPMS components for consideration, refinement, and finalization.  The \ncomplete draft UPMS will be reviewed and feedback sought before it is finalized and presented \nto the Cabinet for its endorsement. \n \n17.  On the basis of the reviews and stakeholder consultations, the consultants will develop a \nconceptual  design  for  the  investment  project,  including  physical  works  and  institutional  or \nlegislative  adjustments,  as  appropriate.  The  conceptual  design  will  identify  an  integrated \npackage of structural improvements such as drainage, roads, sanitation and/or housing.   \n \n18.  Phase 2 will start with an agreement on a conceptual design for the integrated urban \ndevelopment project for Nuku\u2019alofa. The detailing of the project design will include identifying \nUPMS  components  suitable  for  inclusion  in  an  investment  project,  e.g.,  implementation  of \ninstitutional  adjustments  and  capacity  building  to  support  and  sustain  infrastructure \nimprovements. Project detailing will also be completed in a participatory approach to allow for \ndiscussion  and  agreement  on  the  project  components.  The  consultants  will  prepare  the \njustification for the Project, expected outputs and outcomes with monitorable indicators, cost \nestimates,  financing  plan,  and  procurement  needs,  as  well  as  recommend  institutional \narrangements. The TOR for consulting services to be financed under the proposed loan will be \nprepared. Project beneficiaries will be identified and the proposed project\u2019s impact on poverty \nreduction or improvement of the lives of lower income groups assessed.  \n \n19.  The  feasibility  study  will  include  comprehensive  economic,  financial,  social,  and \nenvironmental analyses in accordance with relevant ADB guidelines. The study will assess any \nrisks  from  the  proposed  projects  and  identify  means  to  mitigate  them  in  accordance  with \nrelevant ADB safeguard policies.11  \n \n                                                 \n11 The Project is preliminarily categorized as environment category B. The Initial Poverty and Social Assessment \nindicates resettlement will be minimal, if any. No other social concerns are anticipated at this time.  \n ", "  5\n20.  Results of the feasibility study will be incorporated as appropriate into the TA reports and \ndeveloped as inputs to the report and recommendation of the President (RRP). Initial loan \nprocessing  activities,  e.g.,  loan  fact-finding,  will  be  undertaken  concurrently  with  final  TA \nreviews. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n21.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $794,000  equivalent,  comprising  foreign \nexchange of $640,000 and local currency of $154,000 equivalent. ADB will provide the entire \nforeign exchange and $60,000 equivalent in local currency. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government has \ngiven its assurance that when the TA begins, it will contribute the remaining local currency cost \nof  $94,000  equivalent  for  office  accommodation,  counterpart  staff  support,  field  transport \nassistance, facilities for seminars and meetings, and other administrative expenses in kind. The \nGovernment  will  provide  all  information  required  for  the  TA  activities.  Details  of  the  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Ministry of Finance (MOF), with MOW as \nthe  Implementing  Agency.  A  TA  Steering  Committee  (SC)  will  be  established,  to  include \ndirectors or equivalent level-officials from MOF, MOW, Ministry of Lands and Surveys, Ministry \nof Health, Department of Environment, NGOs including women\u2019s groups, Tonga Water Board, \nand Chamber of Commerce. The SC will be chaired by MOF and will assist MOF and MOW in \nguiding the TA activities. The SC will meet as necessary, at least monthly, to discuss the \ndevelopment of the UPMS and the investment project.   \n \n23.  The TA will be implemented over 13 months from January 2006 to February 2007. \nConsulting services of 34 person-months (24 international and 10 domestic) will have expertise \nin urban planning, institutional development, water and wastewater engineering, legal aspects, \ncommunity development, environmental protection, economics, finance, drainage engineering, \nand housing. ADB will engage the consultants through a firm, using the quality- and cost-based \nselection  method,  in  accordance with  its Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  In  addition  to  the \ndomestic consultants, one or more NGOs will be engaged to assist in community awareness \nand community participation activities. The outline TORs are in Appendix 4. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Tonga for preparing the Integrated Urban Development Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nSustained urban  Improved drainage and  Loan progress reports  \u2022  There is continued \nplanning and  flood managementa   political will. \nmanagement  with    Asian Development Bank  \u2022  Project design is \nimproved provision of  Improved living  (ADB) and Government  implemented effectively. \nbasic social services in  conditions in project  project completion report  \u2022  Government and ADB \nlow-lying areas of  areaa   sign loan agreement. \nNuku\u2019alofa  Government statistics  Risk \nResource availability \nOutcome      Assumption \nProject design and  Memorandum of  Memorandum of  \u2022  Broad stakeholder \nimproved urban  Understanding signed  Understanding   support for urban \nplanning and  in Appraisal Mission in    planning and \nmanagement  December 2006  Review missions  management is \n    developed and \nGovernment initiates  Technical assistance (TA)  sustained. \nimplementation of  reports  Risks \nurban planning and    \u2022  Government priorities \nmanagement strategy  Cabinet papers/records  change. \n(UPMS) by March 2007  \u2022  Government seeks other \nsources of funding. \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Kingdom of Tonga: \nSome 23% of Tongan households are estimated to experience periodic difficulties in meeting their basic \nneeds.  The  hardship  and  poverty  assessment  identified  causes  of  poverty  as  the  lack  of  income \nopportunities and limited access to basic social services. Tonga has made progress toward achieving \nmany  of  the  targets  in  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  and  access  to  safe  water  is \nwidespread.  With  decreasing  availability  of  suitable  land,  however,  social  services  in  Nuku\u2019alofa, \nTongatapu, are deteriorating and sanitation, drainage, roads, and waste disposal need attention. There \nare signs of rising unemployment and rural-urban drift toward the main islands. Urban migration and \nsettlements in geographic areas with poor urban infrastructure are inadequate to meet the growing \ndemand of incoming Tongans. Coupled with recurring flooding in the area, health and social indicators are \ndeclining. Tonga\u2019s limited land resources, combined with the growing urban population, are increasing \npressure on Nuku\u2019alofa\u2019s living conditions. The Government acknowledges that for sustained growth, \nhealth, education, water and sanitation, physical infrastructure, and the environment have to be improved. \n \nThe Ministry of Health and the Department of Environment have raised health concerns about some \nrecent urban settlements in Tongatapu. The settlements in low-lying locations unsuited for housing result \nfrom the urban drift from outer islands. The project preparatory technical assistance (TA) will determine the \nextent of the challenge and examine options and associated costs of improving basic infrastructure in \nthose areas to address the environmental and health concerns of the people living there. Improved living \nconditions will allow beneficiaries to be more self-reliant and enjoy greater opportunities to participate in \neconomic activities. \n \nPriority issues to be addressed are (i) poor living conditions that contribute to the widening urban hardship \ngap;  (ii)  continuation  of  urban  informal  settlements;  (iii)  potential  deterioration  in  social  and  human \ndevelopment rates; and (iv) how structural, institutional, and local actions can assist in reducing poverty \nlevels in Tonga. Three key groups can play a collective role in reducing poverty: (i) government agencies, \n(ii) family groups, and (iii) nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations \n(CBOs).  A  participatory  and  holistic  approach  will  be  followed  in  developing  a  long-term  urban \nmanagement and planning strategy and an investment project to address the main contributors to the poor \nliving conditions. With improved urban services, the project will give lower income groups access to higher \nquality land and evade flooding threats. Through improved health conditions in the target areas in low-lying \nlocations unsuited for housing, the Government will be able to reduce expenditures on health and \nconcentrate on other issues in the long term.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Poverty intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? A detailed socioeconomic survey must be conducted in \nNuku\u2019alofa, the project area. To address the various dimensions of poverty and to facilitate preparation of \nthe urban planning and management strategy, the socioeconomic surveys will be accompanied by focus \ngroup discussions involving key stakeholder representatives of the society.
