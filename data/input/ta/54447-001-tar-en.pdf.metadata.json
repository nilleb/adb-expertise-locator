INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will provide policy recommendations \nand  technical  guidance  for  disaster  risk  management  (DRM)  based  on  natural  hazard \ncharacteristics, exposure, and physical and socioeconomic vulnerabilities.1 Specifically, the TA will \ndevelop frameworks, build capacity, provide technical guidance, and define cost-effective options \nfor DRM in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The TA will foster regional partnerships among \nthe PRC and neighboring countries on improving disaster preparedness and resilience. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the indicative country operations business plan for the PRC, 2021\u2013\n2023.2 The TA is aligned with the country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2021\u20132025 (strategic \npriority 2) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB),3 and supports all seven operational priorities of \nADB's Strategy 2030.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Because of its size and environmental diversity, the PRC is highly exposed to a range of \nfrequent natural hazards affecting a wide geographic area. The combined impact of climate change \nand urbanization poses mounting pressure on society, as the exposure of people and infrastructure \nto natural hazards is increasing, outpacing the decrease in vulnerability. Women, children, and the \nvulnerable are disproportionately affected by disasters. Disasters undermine efforts to eradicate \npoverty, as disasters can perpetuate the cycle of poverty and impair households\u2019 development \nprospects in the long run. Capacity for DRM is inadequate. Some regions still lack the capability \nto establish a disaster risk assessment tool. Others have not systematically explored measures to \nreduce disaster risk, such as urban planning, urban regeneration, early warning systems, disaster \nrisk financing tools, and protection mechanisms, and their cost-effectiveness remains untested.5 \nConsidering the high potential demand for investment in disaster risk reduction, priorities need to \nbe established, in part based on cost-effectiveness. Flood storage and detention areas (FSDAs), \nwhich are vital in flood mitigation, face a serious dilemma because of local socioeconomic \ndevelopment.6 Lastly, the capacity for early response and recovery still needs improvement to \nprevent deaths and reduce economic losses. Therefore, an integrated framework for cost-effective \n \n1  In the TA, disasters refer to those caused by natural hazards, including geophysical, meteorological, climatological, \nand hydrological hazards. \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 8 June 2021. The TA was proposed \nas a cluster TA with four subprojects, now combined into one TA for efficiency gains. Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous \nRegion (GZAR) and Fujian Province in the original proposals are retained under this TA. \n3 ADB. 2021. Country Partnership Strategy: People's Republic of China, 2021\u20132025\u2014Toward High-Quality, Green \nDevelopment. Manila. \n4  The seven operational priorities are (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) accelerating \nprogress in gender equality; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability; (iv) making cities more livable; (v) promoting rural development and food security; (vi) \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity; and (vii) fostering regional cooperation and integration (ADB. \n2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila). \n5  Cost-effectiveness analysis refers to the unit costs of achieving outcomes of interest to local policy makers (e.g., \nstrengthening resilience). In cases where local policy makers have an interest in multiple outcomes that can best be \nharmonized as economic values, effectiveness will refer to benefits, so that the approach is a cost\u2013benefit analysis. \nFor simplicity, \u201ccost\u2013effectiveness analysis\u201d is interpreted to include \u201ccost\u2013benefit analysis\u201d in this document.  \n6  FSDAs can help attenuate flood peaks by holding excessive runoff, thereby reducing damage in downstream areas. \nThe design of FSDA features and operational modalities depends on hydrological, geological, and socioeconomic \ncharacteristics of the river basin. Currently, the functionality of FSDAs is challenged by local socioeconomic \ndevelopment which result in higher exposure of assets and humans to floods but is limited because of the nature of \nFSDAs. Socioeconomic development in FSDAs is not resilient: asset and socioeconomic losses are high and recovery \nafter floods is slow.  \n ", "2 \nDRM, including understanding of disaster risks, solutions for disaster risk reduction, and early \nresponse and recovery, is required to support sustainable development. \n \n4.  The National Comprehensive Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Plan, 2016\u20132020 (i) \nreiterates the complexity of disasters and the weaknesses in disaster risk prevention, mitigation, \nand rescue; (ii) promotes shared responsibility mechanisms between central government and local \nauthorities in decision-making; (iii) supports insurance and other market-based solutions; and (iv) \npromotes international collaboration.7 The 2017 Pilot Work for Climate Adaptive City Construction \nhighlights the need for urban adaptability to extreme weather events and capacity for disaster \nmonitoring and early warning.8 The PRC launched the first national comprehensive disaster risk \nsurvey in  2020,  headed  by  the  Ministry of  Emergency  Management,  to  understand  hazard \nexposure and to assess the capacity of local government, society, and community in disaster \nprevention, mitigation, and rescue. In response to government guidelines, local authorities have \ndeveloped customized plans for DRM and climate change adaptation, such as the Guangxi \nZhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR) Climate Change Adaptation Plan, 2016\u20132020.9 \n \n5.  The TA will build on the government's efforts and partner with four executing agencies. The \nTA will (i) improve the understanding of disaster risk in GZAR;10 (ii) develop solutions for disaster \nresilience strengthening, including (a) recommendations and measures to reduce disaster risk in \nGZAR; (b) an FSDA model customized to local socioeconomic development and climate change; \nand (c) resilient city development, including urban planning, construction, and management, with \na focus on smart technologies, operation, and financing; (iii) conduct research on rapid action \nteams for flood and typhoon response in Fujian Province;11 and (iv) foster regional collaboration \non investment in resilience. The TA will cover a wide geographic area encompassing provinces \nand cities at various levels of economic development, which provide a basis to assess the cost-\neffectiveness of various options for investment in resilience.12 The TA will foster institutional \ncoordination among the four implementing agencies, strengthening institutional cooperation and \ndisaster risk governance. The TA will generate regional public goods by promoting knowledge and \nexperience sharing among the PRC and selected disaster-prone countries,13 and by establishing \nbilateral and multilateral frameworks to promote investment in resilience, supported by the Greater \nMekong Subregion Urban Development Strategic Framework, 2015\u20132022 and the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) 2030 Strategic Framework.14 \n \n \n7  State Council of the PRC. 2016.

GZAR\u2019s gross domestic product per capita was among lowest 10% in the PRC \nin 2019. \n11  Fujian Province is on the southeast coast of the PRC and is exposed to frequent floods and typhoons, with an average \nof one significant flood event every 2 years and 7 or 8 typhoons every year. \n12  For example, market-based solutions can be assessed in regions with mature capital markets and strong interest from \nthe private sector, and public budget\u2013based social protection mechanisms can be assessed in poor areas, with a \nfocus on prevention of disaster-induced poverty.  \n13  The list includes Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation members (Mongolia and Pakistan); Nepal; and Greater \nMekong Subregion countries (Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam). \n14  ADB. 2015.

The TA is aligned with the following impacts: disaster risk prevention and mitigation \nimproved (footnote 7), and international cooperation and global partnership for disaster risk \nreduction strengthened.15 The TA will have the following outcome: readiness to invest in disaster \nrisk reduction improved.16 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Disaster risk identification and assessment improved. The output will help \nGZAR assess disaster risk in all its dimensions: vulnerability; exposure of people and assets; \nhazard characteristics; and impact, including disaggregated impact analysis by age, income, and \ngender. The output will carry out the following activities: (i) collecting and reviewing historical data \non hazards and exposure of people and assets, identifying people and assets at risk, and \nparameterizing vulnerability of human capital and infrastructure in GZAR and, at a more granular \nlevel, in Wuzhou; (ii) creating a disaster risk assessment index system; and (iii) developing a \ndisaster risk assessment tool to estimate disaggregated statistics on disaster losses. The tool can \nhelp in understanding how a specific group of assets or people (such as women and the poor) are \naffected by hazards, allowing for identification of priorities for investment in resilience. The tool will \nbe shared in areas covered by the other outputs, and training will be provided to government \nofficials to improve their understanding of disaster risk assessment. \n \n8.  Output  2:  Solutions  to  strengthen  disaster  resilience  proposed.  The  output  will \ndevelop measures for disaster risk reduction, including (i) hazard exposure control; (ii) vulnerability \nreduction; (iii) early warning systems; and (iv) innovative market-based solutions, including (a) \nmechanisms  to  increase  private  sector  participation  and  risk  sharing;  and  (b)  protection \nmechanisms for all the affected\u2014people; social and physical infrastructure; and the productive \nsector, including micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. The measures will be integrated into \nthe disaster risk assessment tool developed under output 1 to assess their cost-effectiveness, \nusing scenario analyses, where gender-, age-, and poverty-inclusive, cost-effective disaster risk \nreduction  measures  can  be  identified.  The  output  consists  of  three  components  under  the \nresponsibility of three implementing agencies. Building on the results from output 1, output 2a will \ndevelop disaster risk reduction measures and policy recommendations for identified risk areas and \ndraft a report on a GZAR disaster risk reduction strategy. Output 2b will analyze current conditions, \nincluding construction, management, and operation of national FSDAs, and recommend FSDA \nconstruction  and  development  models  customized  to  local  socioeconomic  development  and \nclimate change, without compromising their functionality. Output 2c will support the development \nof an urban resilience evaluation method and index system and identify measures for disaster risk \nreduction throughout the whole urban life cycle. Based on hazard characteristics, exposure, and \nvulnerability, customized disaster risk reduction measures will be designed for Wuzhou. \n \n9.  Output 3: Research on rapid action teams for flood and typhoon response produced. \nThe output will develop a modernized model for rapid action teams and help ensure the functioning \nof critical infrastructure affected during or after a disaster by conducting research on rapid action \nteams for flood and typhoon response in Fujian Province. The output will carry out the following \nactivities: (i) analyzing the current conditions and international best practices on rapid action teams \n \n15 United Nations. 2015.

Output 4: Regional collaboration on investing in disaster resilience promoted. The \noutput will strengthen regional collaboration and partnerships on DRM between and among the \nPRC  and  selected  disaster-prone  countries.17 Bilateral  and  multilateral  disaster  resilience\u2013\nstrengthening frameworks will be developed, under which the following activities will be carried out: \n(i) sharing innovative technology and nonsensitive data; (ii) establishing city-to-city partnerships \nfor disaster-resilient city development; (iii) drafting a road map for multi-hazard monitoring and \nearly warning systems; and (iv) drafting disaster-specific action plans for disaster response to \ntransboundary hazards. At least one regional workshop on knowledge sharing, including on \ngender-, poverty-, and age-inclusive investment in resilience, will be organized, with women \nmaking up at least 30% of participants. TA findings and workshop feedback will be summarized in \na knowledge product and published through ADB dissemination channels. \n \n11.  Innovative features. Innovative features of the TA include (i) inclusiveness of major \nstakeholders to provide integrated solutions for DRM, with improved institutional arrangements \nand disaster risk governance; (ii) tailored solutions for DRM considering geographic and economic \nheterogeneity and the local impact of climate change, rather than one solution for all; (iii) a cost-\neffectiveness assessment approach for decision makers in their deliberation of various disaster \nrisk reduction measures; (iv) bilateral and multilateral frameworks under which a variety of activities \nwill be conducted to promote investment in resilience between and among the PRC and selected \ndisaster-prone  countries,  with  potential  for  lending  opportunities  or  innovative  products  and \nservices for regional DRM; and (v) collaboration with existing TA projects across ADB to cross-\nsupport project design and implementation through shared databases, consolidated approaches \nand methodologies, and lessons learned.18 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.
