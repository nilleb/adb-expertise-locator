INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2011 country programming mission the Government of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) to \ndevelop  innovative  financing  structures  for  urban  infrastructure  and  municipal  services  in \nHarbin  Province.  Following  detailed  consultations  during  8\u201313  March  2012  with  the \nHeilongjiang Provincial Finance Department and the Harbin Municipal Finance Bureau, a TA \nfact-finding  mission  on  11\u201312  April  2012  discussed  and  agreed  on  the  objectives,  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, costs, and terms of reference of the proposed TA. The design \nand monitoring framework is Appendix 1.1 \n \n 2.  The TA will strengthen the capacity of Harbin\u2019s municipal financing mechanisms to enable \nthe Harbin municipal government to finance infrastructure and services growth and ensure long-\nterm economic health. The TA will complete analyses of the municipality\u2019s current fiscal health; \nlocal government investment vehicles (LGIVs); infrastructure financing needs and options; and new \nideas for financing municipal needs including taxes, bond issuance, and public\u2013private partnership \n(PPP).  Based  on  the  studies,  final  recommendations  revising  investment  programs  and  the \nrevenue base will be provided.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n 3.  In the PRC, municipal debt systems were revised during the tax reforms of 1994. These \nchanges split the tax base into national, shared, and local taxes. National taxes currently include \ncustoms duties, income taxes on national firms, and consumption taxes. Shared tax revenues \ncome from value-added tax, corporate and personal income taxes, and securities transaction \ntaxes, and these are shared with local governments under varying ratio arrangements. Local \ntaxes include sales taxes and land taxes (currently under pilot). The result of this change has \nbeen  to  shift  revenues  away  from  local  governments  to  the  central  government.  With \naccelerated urbanization and the demands of an export-oriented high-growth economy, local \ngovernments  have  found  themselves  under  significant  pressure  to  provide  infrastructure\u2014\npressure that was exacerbated by the global financial crisis that began in 2007.2 \n \n4.  In 2010, local governments in the PRC accounted for over 80% of public spending, but \nonly 45% of the country\u2019s tax revenues were provided for use at the municipal level. This \ndifference between spending and revenue is around $600 billion or 10% of the gross domestic \nproduct in 2010. To fill this gap, local governments have relied in the past on income generated \nfrom land sales and LGIVs as additional funding sources.  \n \n5.  In July 2011, the National Audit Office released its National Audit of Regional Finances \nreport, highlighting the extensive debt of CNY10.7 trillion issued by local governments, including \nLGIVs that circumvented borrowing rules. The report indicated that 6,576 LGIVs set up by the \nend  of  2010  held  an  estimated  CNY8.5  billion  in  bank  debt,  at  least  60%  of  which  local \ngovernments have the responsibility to repay. Given these figures, and findings that portions of \nthis debt were uncollateralized and not guaranteed by the central government, the government \nis currently reforming municipalities\u2019 use of LGIVs.  \n \n6.  The slowdown in the real estate market is restricting the ability of local governments to \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 June 2012. \n2  Li  Peng.  2012.  China\u2019s  Startling  Local  Debt  Problem.  Asia  Sentinel.  23  April. \nhttp://www.asiasentinel.com/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf. \n ", "2   \nraise  funds.  During  the  real  estate  market  boom  since  2005,  local  governments  became \ndependent on land sales to generate budget revenues. The current slimming of the property \nmarket is now eliminating that option. According to Centaline, a major real estate broker, more \nthan 100 land auctions across the country failed in November 2011. As many of the LGIVs were \nbacked by state land, the shrinking real estate market not only limits future cash inflows but also \nreduces local governments\u2019 ability to pay debt obligations incurred during the global financial \ncrisis.  \n \n7.  In response to lower revenues, Shanghai, Chongqing, and other cities began imposing \ntaxes in 2011 on large single family homes, high-end flats, and second homes and apartments. \nIn theory, such taxes are an excellent source of revenue for these cities, but in practice these \ntaxes have yielded little revenue. As an example, the property tax rate in Chongqing is 0.5%\u2013\n1.2% of estimated value and is levied on only about 8,500 properties, despite there being \n126,000 second homes in Chongqing listed by the National Statistics Bureau at the end of 2011. \nSuch a limited target group meant the tax generated less than 0.2% of Chongqing\u2019s tax revenue \nfor the year. The effort nevertheless demonstrates a willingness to explore new methods of \ngenerating revenue. Other experiences, such as the recent evaluation of the Shanghai\u2013Pudong \nbridge and road tolls, show the importance of balancing revenues with development needs, and \nof considering both core funding and tolls where public goods benefits exist.    \n \n8.  The 12th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development, 2011\u20132015 \ncalls for further infrastructure development implemented by municipalities to sustain rapidly \nincreasing urban populations. New financing mechanisms must be studied and developed at the \nmunicipal level to ensure long-term fiscal health and sustainability. Specific issues faced by \nlocal municipalities include heavy reliance on bank loans and indirect finance channels, lack of \nappropriate governance over ever-expanding government-backed investment units, and having \nto work within a framework of outdated government finance policy.  \n \n9.  Emerging pressures and desire for financial reform provide an excellent opportunity for \nmunicipalities to take three important steps. The first step is to take stock of the current situation \nand  arrangements,  assess  urban  infrastructure  needs  and  the  creditworthiness  of  local \nmunicipalities, and identify immediate measures. The second step is to explore alternative \nsources of financing, review regulatory frameworks, and consider how to appropriately generate \nresources at the municipal level to meet current and anticipated needs. As there is also a desire \nfor institutional reform, it is possible to review and diversify government-led investment bodies \nand further promote business operations such as PPPs. The third step is to start analysis and \ndiscussion of financial flows between municipal government and other levels of government, to \nimprove  understanding,  use  these  funds  more  efficiently,  and  better  monitor  results  and \naccounting for these funds.   \n \n10.  Heilongjiang  developed  a  provincial  development  strategy  under  the  TA  Provincial \nDevelopment Strategies for Two Northeastern Provinces.3 In this strategy, there are specific \ntargets  for  Harbin  municipality,  recognizing  that  the  municipality  generates  two-thirds  of \nprovincial  gross  domestic  product.  These  include  developing  Harbin  as  an  axis  for  a  key \neconomic zone for export and as a pillar for industrial development. The proposed strategy \nplaces significant responsibility on Harbin to provide connecting infrastructure and capacity for \ntrade with the Russian Federation and in the North Asia region. It also mentions the importance \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2008.

Harbin. \n ", "  3 \nof Harbin developing an efficient and effective real estate market. Accordingly, it is critical that \nthe municipality be able to address in-migration and related services, expand infrastructure, and \ncoordinate with the provincial government and other local governments.  \n \n11.  Harbin municipality consists of the eight urban districts of Harbin, three satellite cities, \nand seven rural districts. The urban population is expected to reach 65% of the total by 2016, up \nfrom 55% at the end of 2010, adding over 1 million people to the city. To help manage expected \ngrowth, the city is currently implementing a master plan entitled Further Developing the Northern, \nSouthern, and Central Parts of Harbin Municipality as Well as the Affiliated Counties, to ensure \nthe development of key infrastructure. The Harbin municipal government is working to find a \nbalanced way to ensure capital inflows and reforming its current financial mechanisms to ensure \nlong-term fiscal vitality. This TA will provide a localized opportunity to address the financing \nissues confronting Harbin and a larger opportunity to find solutions that can be applied across \nthe region and the country. \n   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the TA will be the strengthened capacity of local governments to manage \nmunicipal finances. This strengthened capacity will contribute to smooth economic growth and \nhelp provide jobs and increased social services for low-income households migrating into the city \nfrom rural areas. The outcome will be a deepened municipal financing mechanism for Harbin to \nenable the Harbin local government to finance growth and ensure long-term economic health.  \n   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n 13.  The TA will consist of five components: (i) an analysis of current fiscal health; (ii) a review of \nLGIVs, including a case study; (iii) a review of new concepts for innovative and sustainable \nfinancial structures, including a study tour to develop awareness of good infrastructure financing \npractices used by other high-growth cities; (iv) assessment of specific financing options for urban \ninfrastructure development; and (v) the development of knowledge products for each of these \ncomponents.  \n \n14.  The TA will deliver five major outputs, with the following work to be done:  \n \n(i)  Analysis  of  the  current  fiscal  health  of  Harbin  municipality.  Review  the \nmunicipality\u2019s current modes and issues of financing, debt obligations, and financial \nstructures with a focus on infrastructure financing through site visits, meetings with \ngovernment agencies, and document review. Make specific recommendations for \nimmediate actions to improve the financial structures and status of the municipality. \n(ii)  Review and recommendations for improving government-backed investment \nunits, including a case study. Complete a detailed review of a selected LGIV as a \ncase study and summarily assess data on other LGIVs. Make policy suggestions for \nimproving the implementation and reform of governance, transparency mechanisms, \nand the financial management of current government-backed investment units to \npromote  financing  efficiency  toward  increasing  future  urban  infrastructural \nconstruction. \n(iii)  Assessment  and  recommendations  for  improved  municipal  revenue \narrangements.  Review  existing  revenue  sources  and  financing  channels  and \nidentify new ones. Propose sustainable institutional structures that address the \n ", "4   \nfinancial  context  of  the  municipality  based  on  international  good  practice. \nSpecifically, focus on the steps necessary to be selected by the central government \nas an experimental site for municipal bond issuance. In addition, review current \nconcepts  of  revenue  sharing  between  the  local  and  central  governments  and \nidentify the potential for long-term revenue-sharing agreements. Assess asset and \nliability structures and provide recommendations. Review and provide advice on \nimproving credit appraisal and rating processes. \n(iv)  Recommendations  for  new  and  innovative  financing  of  infrastructure \ndevelopment. Propose innovative mechanisms, policy suggestions, and affiliated \naction plans including a detailed focus on PPP or other sustainable and practicable \nmechanisms that will financially support the city\u2019s infrastructure master plan and \naddress  long-term  financing  demands.  To  promote  understanding  and  further \nbroaden views on specific municipal financing tools, conduct an international study \ntour under this output. \n(v)  Synthesis paper and knowledge products. The TA will produce a synthesis \npaper with all four of the areas above blended into an action plan, as well as four \nstand-alone reports, one for each of the previous four outputs. In addition, the TA \nwill sponsor local workshops to present to various stakeholder groups the study \nresults and policy implications.  \n \n15.  Targeted workshops will be organized for different stakeholders at various stages of project \nimplementation,  including  an  inception  workshop,  an  interim  workshop,  a  draft  final  report \nworkshop, and perhaps others. All workshops are expected to be attended by an ADB mission, \ngovernment officials, LGIV representatives, and specialists in relevant fields to ensure the inclusion \nof diverse views and the wide dissemination of project outputs. The executing agency and the \nimplementing agency will ensure that all finalized reports and recommendations are circulated \nacross all relevant provincial and municipal departments and agencies.  \n   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $640,000, of which $400,000 which will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office,  office \nsupplies, domestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions.
