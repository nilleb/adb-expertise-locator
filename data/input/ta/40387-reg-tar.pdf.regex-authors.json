INTRODUCTION \n1.  Under  its  long-term  strategic  framework  2008-2020  (Strategy  2020),  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will refocus its operations on five core areas that best support its \ndevelopment agenda, reflect the needs of its developing member countries (DMCs) and ADB\u2019s \ncomparative strengths, and complement the efforts of its development partners.1 The education \nsector is one of these five core operational areas, in view of its potential to sustain inclusive \nsocial and economic development, and the strength of ADB\u2019s project response to the education \nneeds of the DMCs.  \n \n2.  Strategy  2020  emphasizes  the  need  to  reinforce  the  five  core  areas,  including  the \neducation sector, for sustained growth and access to economic opportunities\u2014the pillars of \ninclusive growth. Strategy 2020 directs ADB to continue to support expanded, higher-quality, \nmore-accessible basic and secondary education, as well as tertiary and higher education.  \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  As economies in the region have grown larger and more complex, they have also \nbecome more integrated through economic and social exchange. Higher education is seen to \nhave an ever-more-important role in human resource development and the movement of people, \nstudents, and the workforce.2 Demand for higher education is expected to double in 5 years and \ntriple in 10 years in many DMCs, to meet their manpower needs for social and economic \ndevelopment and growth,3 and the strong demand will drive the countries to invest more in \nhigher education.  \n \n4.  Therefore, the question is not whether investment in higher education is justified but how \nthe DMC governments can improve higher education through adequate policies and regulations, \nand position their economies to recover from the impact of the current economic crisis. Higher \neducation must also become more diversified, more inclusive and equitable and not catering \nmerely  to  the  upper-income  groups,  and  financially  sustainable  through  cost  sharing  and \npartnerships, including partnerships with private sector.  \n \n5.  While demand for higher education that is more expanded, inclusive and diversified, is \nincreasing in many DMCs, so is concern about its quality and relevance. The current economic \ncrisis  has  heightened  these  concerns.  Demand  for  higher  education  graduates  will  be \nunaffected in some key areas but is already softening in other areas. The DMCs must carefully \nreview higher education priorities to improve quality and relevance to match the needs of the \nlabor markets and knowledge-based economies.  \n \n6.  The rationale for cost-sharing in higher education is strong. Costs per student are much \nhigher in comparison to lower levels of education. On average, low-income countries spend 34 \ntimes more on a student in higher education than they spend on a student in primary education, \nand 14 times more than they spend on a student in secondary education. The corresponding \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "2   \nfigures  for  high-income  countries  are  1.8  and  1.4.4 The  current  economic  crisis  further \nunderlines the importance of cost-sharing and financing partnerships. In the DMCs sudden, \nlarge shifts in government financing in favor of higher education can diminish funds for basic \nand secondary education.  \n \n7.  Arguments that enrollments will increase and equity will improve if higher education is \nfree generally do not hold up in the face of evidence and international comparisons. Given \npublic resource constraints, allocating more public funds to higher education at the expense of \nbasic and secondary education would be counterproductive.5 Moreover, there is substantial \nevidence that an increasing number of students (or their families) in many DMCs are willing and \nable to share the costs of good-quality higher education.6  \n \n8.  Demand for technical assistance (TA) and financing from ADB for higher education \nreform, including financing from ordinary capital resources, is rising. ADB assists DMCs in two \ncategories with different priorities in higher education: (i) low-income and low-middle-income \nDMCs, where the demand is primarily for the expansion of higher education systems to increase \nenrollment,  and  for  infrastructure  development;  and  (ii)  middle-income  DMCs  with \nwell-established higher education systems, where the priorities are quality improvement and \ndiversification to support economic development.  \n \n9.  DMCs seek evidence-based advice and support for capacity development in critical \ndevelopment dimensions in higher education, such as policy, regulation and governance, quality \nassurance, cost-sharing and financing mechanisms, and partnerships with the private sector. \nThese  dimensions  are  interconnected,  in  ways  that  depend  on  DMCs'  stage  of  economic \ndevelopment and strategic priorities in higher education.  \n \n10.  In addition, there is growing demand in the region, particularly in Southeast Asia, for \ncross-border collaboration and partnerships in higher education and labor markets.7 But such \ncollaboration is hampered by the lack of a systematic database on the various institutional \nnetworks, as well as their arrangements and partnerships, that already exist. A comprehensive \ndatabase would promote the sharing of experiences and lessons from regional collaboration \nactivities  and  partnerships,  and  from  collaboration  with  broader  international  networks  and \ninstitutional partners in higher education development.  \n \n                                                 \n4  Glewwe, P. and M.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will bring about comprehensive higher education policies and \nreforms in the region. The outcome includes improved knowledge and strengthened capacity in \nDMCs to plan and implement critical aspects of higher education reform. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.8 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The proposed TA will have the following four components: (i) studies, (ii) knowledge \nproducts, (iii) capacity development and network strengthening, and (iv) the publication of the \nbook Higher Education in Dynamic Asia. \n1.  Studies on Higher Education Reform  \n13.  A comprehensive analysis will be made of the key issues facing higher education, the \ndynamics of higher education supply and demand in the region and differences imposed by the \nlevel  of  economic  development,  the  evolution  of  the  labor  market,  and  higher  education \ndevelopment in low-income and middle-income DMCs (para. 8). Existing data and materials will \nbe used, and supplemented, where necessary, by new data. \n \n14.  The studies will center on the most critical themes in higher education, presented in the \ntable below.  \n \nCritical Themes in Higher Education \nTheme  Illustrative Issues \nInternal efficiency  Quality assurance and accreditation \nFaculty, instruction, and student assessment \nThroughput rates \nExternal efficiency  Relevance to the labor market, and diversification \n  Partnerships between the public and private sectors, and other partnerships \nPrivate education  \nCosts and financing  Cost-sharing and innovative financing mechanisms \nSustainable financing \nAdministration and  Policy and regulatory frameworks \nsupervision  Governance structures \nManagement of higher education institutions  \nAccess and equity  Equitable access \nTargeted support for disadvantaged students \nSpecial issues  Regional cooperation / cross-border collaboration \n  Information and communication technology for service delivery, in distance \neducation, open universities, and virtual universities, among others \nResearch and innovation; higher education for science and technology, and \nfor knowledge-based economies \n \n                                                 \n8  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 May 2009. \n ", "4   \n15.  These  themes  represent  dimensions  of  concern  relevant  to  both  individual  higher \neducation institutions and national higher education systems. The issues identified here are only \nillustrative at this stage, as the TA will need the latitude to assign emphasis to those issues that, \naccording to the studies, are most important to the DMCs at different stages of economic \ndevelopment.  \n  2.  Knowledge Products on Higher Education Reform \n16.  In this component, concise knowledge products that deal with important and timely \npolicy, strategic, and technical issues in higher education reform and the ways in which they \ninterconnect  will  be  prepared  and  published.  The  issues  will  interconnect  differently  in \nlow-income  and  middle-income  DMCs.  The  knowledge  products  will  help  to  identify  the \nimportant contextual factors and the best policy, strategic, and technical choices that can be \nmade under the circumstances. The studies and ensuing analytical papers of the TA, as well as \nexisting material and literature on higher education, will inform the knowledge products.  \n3.  Capacity Development and Network Strengthening for Higher Education \nReform  \n17.  Critical  issues  in  higher  education  reform  in  the  DMCs  and  the  subregions  will  be \ndiscussed in workshops and seminars, to be organized in cooperation with leading higher \neducation institutions and networks in the region. A comprehensive database of institutional \nnetworks  and  partnerships  in  higher  education  in  the  region  will  also  be  established.  The \ndatabase will facilitate the sharing of knowledge between networks and partnership initiatives in \nhigher education development in the region\u2014their objectives, operating arrangements, and \nsuccesses and challenges, and the opportunities for strengthening subregional and regional \ncollaboration and partnership with international networks and institutions. Once established, the \ndatabase  will  also  be  used  in  analyzing  further  development  needs  in  this  area,  and \nrecommending operating and financing arrangements. The recommendations may include, but \nwill not be limited to, setting up regional or subregional resource centers for higher education \ndevelopment, either by strengthening current leading networks or by establishing new centers.  \n \n18.  A major international conference on higher education reform will be organized to share \nthe outcomes from the workshops and seminars, discuss the findings of the studies under the \nTA, and receive feedback before the study outputs are finalized. Delegates to the conference \nwill come from the DMCs, key higher education institutions and networks in the region, the \nprivate sector, and other relevant regional and international partners and stakeholders in higher \neducation. \n4.  Publication on Higher Education in Dynamic Asia \n19.  A comprehensive publication, Higher Education in Dynamic Asia, will be produced in \nprint and compact-disc (CD) format under the TA, and published or copublished by ADB.9 The \npublication will draw on the TA activities and outputs produced under components 1\u20133 above.  \n \n20.  Print and CD copies of the knowledge products and publications developed under the \nTA  will  be  shared  with  the  relevant  ministries,  higher  education  institutions,  and  other \n                                                 \n9  The possibility of joint publication with a commercial publisher that specializes in higher education issues will be \nexplored. \n ", "  5\nstakeholders in the DMCs, as well as with higher education networks in the region and beyond. \nThe products and publications will be disseminated at specific launch events, through ADB\u2019s \neducation  sector  website,  in  workshops  and  seminars  under  ADB\u2019s  higher  education  loan \nprojects in DMCs, and in other appropriate subregional and regional events. The intent is to \nreach as wide a range of stakeholders as possible, in support of knowledge sharing and \ndialogue on higher education reform issues and priorities. The products and publications will \nalso  guide  ADB  mission  leaders  in  processing  specific  higher  education  projects  for  ADB \nfinancing. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The TA will cost about $800,000. It will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program (Technical Assistance Special Fund \u2013 IV). The bulk of the financing will cover \nthe  costs  of  consulting  services,  travel,  workshops  and  seminars,  a  conference,  and \npublications. Reports and communication, equipment, and miscellaneous administration and \nsupport costs will take up a minor part of the financing. A breakdown of the cost estimates is \nfound in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and its Poverty Reduction, Gender, and \nSocial Development Division, under the Regional and Sustainable Development Department \n(RSDD), will be the focal point for TA implementation and administration. \n  \n23.  The TA consulting team will be headed by an experienced international expert in higher \neducation. Over 8 person-months of intermittent participation, he or she will plan, manage, and \ncoordinate  the  inputs  and  outputs of  the  TA  team,  and  will  report  to  the  Practice  Leader \n(Education Sector), RSDD. The TA consulting team will also include pools of international \nconsultants  (15  person-months)  and  national  consultants  (13  person-months),  and  an \ninternational consultant for the establishment and regular updating of the necessary databases \n(12 person-months). The database consultant will also contribute to the analytical work and TA \ncoordination, and will be based at RSDD.  \n \n24.  Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. Given the intermittent \nnature of the assignments and the variety of skills required, all consultants will be hired as \nindividual consultants by ADB according to its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). \n \n25.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, starting in September 2009. The TA team \nleader will submit (i) an inception report by the end of the 2nd month; (ii) an interim report by the \nend of the 12th month; (iii) a draft final report by the end of the 22nd month; and (iv) a final \nreport, incorporating comments from ADB and stakeholders in participating DMCs, by the end of \nthe 24th month. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis for \nHigher Education in Dynamic Asia, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nSummary  and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nComprehensive  Higher education policies  National plans for higher  Demand for higher \nhigher education  and regulations in DMCs  education development  education and its reform \npolicies and    in DMCs  will continue to increase \nreforms in the    in the region  \nregion  DMC documents on   \n  higher education policies  Risk \nand regulations, and the   \ncorresponding financing  Progress in higher \nstrategies and  education reforms will be \npartnerships  undermined by slow \nDMC government \napproval of policies and \nregulations, and by the \neconomic crisis affecting \nDMCs  \n \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nImproved  Increasing attention to  DMC programs and  DMCs will have enough \nknowledge and  policies, system reforms,  implementation plans,  human resource \nstrengthened  cost-efficient and  and partnership and  capacity to efficiently use \ncapacity in DMCs  sustainable financing,  financing plans, for  the outputs of the TA in \nto plan and  and partnerships in  higher education   higher education \nimplement critical  higher education, in  subsector planning \naspects of higher  education sector planning   \neducation reform   in DMCs   \n   \n   \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.
