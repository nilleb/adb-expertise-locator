INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will improve management \nof the urban public transport system in Phnom Penh to achieve a sustainable integrated system \nand promote its use by (i) developing policy guides and a planning toolkit for relevant public \ntransport authorities; (ii) formulating candidate integrated urban public transport improvement \nprograms; and (iii) providing capacity development training to the public transport authorities to \nimprove their system management capacity, and public awareness-raising workshops to promote \nuse of the system. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations business \nplan for Cambodia, 2018\u20132020.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The population of Phnom Penh, which is Cambodia\u2019s capital, increased from 1.00 million \nin 1998 to 1.69 million in 2013;2 this trend is expected to continue, with the population forecast to \nincrease to 2.41 million in 2020 and 2.87 million in 2035. It is expected that the number of all \nperson trips, including to home, to work, to school, business and private by walking, motorbike, \npassenger car, and paratransit, will increase from 4.30 million trips in 2012 to 6.97 million trips in \n2035. Urban areas have been expanding along major roads towards the west, north, and south, \nand beyond existing urban areas to the west.3 \n \n4.  Traffic conditions in Phnom Penh are worsening. The country\u2019s economic growth has \nspurred a rapid increase in the number of vehicles, with a 350% increase in the number of \nregistered vehicles from 2001 to 2012, while the average travel speed in the city center decreased \nfrom 22.9 to 14.6 kilometers per hour over the same period (footnote 3). \n \n5.  In line with the 2001 Transport Master Plan (TMP), which had a target year of 2015,4 the \nGovernment  of  Cambodia  invested  in  road  construction  and  improvement,  intersection \nimprovement, traffic signal installation, and traffic safety improvements. These investments have \nimproved traffic conditions to some degree, but a 2015 review found that a public transport system \nand traffic management measures are required to effectively alleviate the worsening traffic \nconditions.5 \n \n6.  In  2014,  with  support  of  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  the \ngovernment reformulated the 2001 TMP and developed the Comprehensive Urban Transport \nPlan (CUTP) to improve people\u2019s mobility, maintain people- and environment-friendly urban \nconditions, and revitalize economic activities in Phnom Penh City by promoting a shift from a \nprivate-oriented urban transport system to a well-balanced system of public and private transport \nwith a combination of public transport enhancement, traffic management improvement, and road \nnetwork improvement. The CUTP is an updated TMP with a 2035 target date that is built on a \ntraffic-demand forecast model; it includes an overall investment implementation plan, with an \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2017.

It also includes medium-term (2017\u20132020) and long-\nterm (2021\u20132035) action plans that define targets, actions, periods, and responsible agencies. \n \n7.  The action plans include three components: (i) public transport, involving completion of a \nbasic  bus  network  and  implementation  of  rail  transit,  with  8  proposed  actions;  (ii)  traffic \nmanagement, comprising upgrading of signalized intersections and traffic demand management, \n(such as park and bus ride, parking measures, and improvement of the pedestrian walking \nenvironment  and  commodity  transport),  with  8  proposed  actions;  and  (iii)  roads,  involving  \ndevelopment of radial, ring, and inner city trunk road systems, and improvement of bottleneck \nintersections, with 13 proposed actions. Phnom Penh needs to implement the public transport \nand traffic management components, because the road network improvement alone is insufficient \nto improve traffic conditions. \n \n8.  The government and Phnom Penh Capital City (PPCC) have been implementing the \nmedium-term action plan for the public transport and traffic management components with the \nsupport of development partners in an effort to meet travel demand resulting from Phnom Penh\u2019s \ngrowth, and to address worsening traffic conditions. PPCC introduced 3 bus routes serviced by \n57 buses in 2014, and expanded up to 8 routes served by additional buses provided by the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  JICA  in  2017.  Also,  JICA  has  upgraded  100  signalized \nintersections and is preparing a pilot bus priority lane. In addition, JICA and France plan to \nintroduce an urban rail for the East\u2013West transport corridor and a tramway as a part of the long-\nterm action plan. \n \n9.  The public transport and traffic management components are emerging topics, and the \ngovernment and PPCC officials require new standards and regulations to consistently plan, \ndesign, and implement actions (especially for mode interchanges) in the CUTP medium- and long-\nterm action plans, in support of the development of a sustainable integrated urban public transport \nsystem. The development of standards and regulations will allow the officials to coordinate and \nmanage the action plans to (i) improve accessibility from the travel starting point to the urban \npublic transport system; and (ii) improve connectivity or integration among different modes (e.g., \nprivate vehicle, paratransit, walking and public transport), and within a mode (e.g., bus to bus). \nMeeting these needs is essential to ensure the urban public transport system plays a greater role \nin transit in Phnom Penh. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: people- and environment-friendly urban \nconditions maintained, and urban activities in Phnom Penh City vitalized (footnote 3). The TA will \nhave the following outcome: urban public transport system management improved.6  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n11.  Output 1: Sustainable integrated urban public transport policy guides and planning \ntoolkit  developed.  The  TA  will  develop  policy  guides  to  regulate  planning,  design,  and \nimplementation of an integrated urban public transport system by articulating suitable measures \nand standards. With a focus on public transport and traffic management, the TA will review \nexisting plans, standards, regulations, and planning practices; the operation and management of \n                                                \n6 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nurban transport systems and public space; and the institutional settings of the authorities who \nplan, operate, and manage these. The TA will then assess infrastructure and people\u2019s needs, \nconstraints, and behavior, through surveys of literature, traffic (through counts) and physical \ninfrastructure along the existing and planned urban public transport network in Phnom Penh.7 \nBased on the prior activities, the TA will identify and propose suitable urban public transport \nmeasures and standards. The policy guides will cover integration of public transport, including \nwaterways, pedestrian walkways, transit malls, and park and ride facilities; the use of public space, \nand control of public and private space around bus stops and urban rail stations; and operational \ntools and schemes (e.g., information and communication technology, and outsourcing to the \nprivate sector).8 Policies to promote the use of the public transport system will be (i) responsive \nto the needs of different segments of the population, especially women, the elderly, and people \nwith disabilities; and (ii) grounded in theory, experience, and research. The policy guides will be \nused to prepare new transport regulations. \n \n12.  The TA will also develop a planning toolkit, with planning processes and tips built on good \nurban  public  transport  system  development  practices,  ensuring  that  the  needs  of  different \nsegments of the population will be identified and addressed during the planning process. It will be \na comprehensive resource that will allow officials to develop a sustainable, integrated urban public \ntransport system by identifying options (e.g., pedestrian subways, footbridges, and park and ride \nfacilities)  through  assessments  that  consider  technical,  economic,  financial,  gender, \nenvironmental, and social aspects. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Candidate integrated  urban  public  transport improvement  programs \nformulated.  Based on output 1, the TA will work with government and PPCC officials to formulate \ncandidate  integrated  urban  public  transport  improvement  programs,  including  scope  and \ninvestment costs, for at least three planned or ongoing actions in the CUTP medium-term and \nlong-term action plans, and examine their feasibility through a preliminary feasibility study. The \ncandidate programs will aim to improve safety, affordability, accessibility, and connectivity in the \nvicinity of bus stops and interchanges, urban rail stations, and major transit hubs of the action \nplans (which were developed and implemented with little coordination), and seek to maximize the \nefficacy of the urban public transport network.9  \n \n14.  Output 3: Urban public transport management capacity and awareness improved. \nThe TA will improve the capacity of officials to develop candidate integrated urban public transport \nimprovement programs and manage an urban public transport system by providing training \nsessions using the deliverables in outputs 1 and 2. A study tour will be undertaken to review and \ndiscuss good practices\u2014regarding traffic demand management, transit-oriented development, \nand urban public transport system planning and development, in terms of sustainability and social \ninclusion\u2014with authorities and developers in the study tour destination country. The findings of \nthe study tour will be incorporated in the deliverables of the two outputs. In addition, the TA will \npromote the use of the urban public transport system by raising public awareness on system \n                                                \n7 The Ministry of Public Works and Transport plans to apply the guidelines to other urban cities (i.e., Kondal, Siem \nReap, and Baat Dambang) in the near future. A rapid assessment will be made as to whether the policy guides can \nbe applied in the three cities, with consideration given to traffic and physical infrastructure similarities and differences. \n8 JICA will develop a transport policy and technical specification related to an urban railway, a bus system, traffic \nmanagement, parking management, paratransit management, and a fare policy. France plans to conduct a feasibility \nstudy and produce a policy and technical specification for a tramway. These products will be summarized and \nexplained in the policy guidelines and toolkit. \n9  If the government requests ADB to implement the candidate integrated urban public transport improvement \nprograms, ADB will process a transaction TA (programmed for 2019 in the ADB country operations business plan for \nCambodia, 2018\u20132020) to prepare a sustainable integrated urban public transport improvement project in 2021. \n ", "4 \nsafety, security, and efficiency, and will reach out to both women and men by formulating a \ncommunication tool based on the two outputs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,545,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2. The following are ineligible expenditures: (i) purchase of vehicles, \n(ii) salaries for civil servants, (iii) scholarships or long internships, (iv) detailed engineering design, \n(v) civil works and other related expenses, and (vi) those under ADB\u2019s List of Ineligible Items (or \nNegative List) and Prohibited Investment Activities List.10 \n \n16.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office, \naccess to information and reports, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The executing agency of the TA will be the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT), \nwhile the implementing agency will be the PPCC. The MPWT and PPCC will coordinate to \nsuccessfully deliver the three outputs. The MPWT will be responsible for leading the development \nof the policy guides and toolkit under output 1. The PPCC will be the main beneficiary of the TA \nunder outputs 2 and 3. The Transport and Communications Division of ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia \nDepartment will be responsible for TA administration, consultant recruitment, and consultant \ncontract management. The TA is expected to be implemented from 1 April 2018 to 30 June 2020. \n \n18.  To effectively deliver and adopt the outputs, the MPWT and PPCC will each appoint one \nfocal point officer, who will directly communicate with the consultants. To develop the sustainable \nintegrated urban public transport policy guides, the MPWT and PPCC will form a task force with \nthe support of the consultants. The task force shall include relevant authorities, such as the \nMinistry of Economy and Finance, and invite key representatives from the public transport industry, \nsuch as paratransit providers and bus operators. In addition, TA activities and deliverables will be \nshared with relevant agencies and development partners at the Infrastructure Regional Integration \nTechnical Working Group chaired by MPWT and JICA. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  April 2018\u2013June 2020 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Public Works and Transport \nImplementing agency  Phnom Penh Capital City \nADB for TA administration, consultant recruitment, and consultant contract \nmanagement \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nQCBS 90:10, FTP  107 person-months  $1,380,000 \nAdvance contracting  The consulting service is proposed for advance contracting. \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover upon TA completion  The goods (indicatively, 5 computers, 5 computer software, 1 printer and \nphotocopying machine, 1 video camera, 5 portable traffic counters, and 10 \nhand-held intersection traffic counters) will be turned over to the Ministry of \nPublic Works and Transport and Phnom Penh Capital City upon TA \ncompletion. \n                                                \n10 A study tour under output 3 is justified with detailed description, objectives, and budget, and approved by the \nGovernment of Japan. \n ", "5 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, FTP = full technical proposal, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, TA = \ntechnical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n19.
