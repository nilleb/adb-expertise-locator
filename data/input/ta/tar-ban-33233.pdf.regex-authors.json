In its effort to sustain strong economic performance and reduce poverty, Bangladesh \nfaces the challenge of maintaining sound macroeconomic management. Improved institutional \ncapabilities  of  the  key  economic  agencies  is  a  prerequisite  for  a  stable  macroeconomic \nenvironment. At the request of the Government, an advisory technical assistance (ADTA) for \nEfficiency Enhancement of Fiscal Management II is included in the 2002 technical assistance \n(TA) program for Bangladesh. The ADTA Fact-Finding Mission, conducted in October 2002, \nreached an understanding with the Government on the ADTA goals, purpose, scope, terms of \nreference for consultants, cost and financing arrangements, and implementation arrangements.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is the key economic government agency. Its Finance \nDivision (i) prepares and implements the national budget; (ii) manages and coordinates fiscal, \nmonetary, and external sector policies; and (iii) designs and implements important economic \nand structural reforms.  \n \n3.  ADB provided two TAs to strengthen the research and policy analysis capabilities of the \nFinance Division,2 which lacked the capacity to address structural reform in a comprehensive \nand analytical manner based on a clear understanding of macroeconomic implications. Policy \nchanges  used  to  be  considered  in  an  ad  hoc  manner  without  assessment  of  the \ninterrelationships between policy efforts and goals in dealing with long-term objectives and \nshort-term situations.  \n \n4.  Both TAs achieved their major objectives and the following: \n \n(i)  A  dynamic  computable  general  equilibrium  (CGE)  model  was  developed  to \naddress  policy  issues  of  concern  to  the  Finance  Division.  Several  training \ncourses  were  conducted  to  transfer  the  modeling  expertise  to  the  Finance \nDivision, other government agencies, and research and academic institutions. As \na result, several Finance Division staff are now capable of running the CGE \nmodel, which was applied for policy analyses, and monitoring of policy impact \nand evaluation of policy options. The Finance Division prepared a large number \nof  analytical  papers  on  different  national  and  international  economic  issues, \nwhich  helped  the  Government  address  several  policy  issues.  Several \ndevelopment workshops were also conducted to discuss the major fiscal and \nmacroeconomic development issues.  \n \n(ii)  Five studies were done on domestic debt management, nontax revenue and non-\nNational  Board  of  Revenue  (NBR)  taxes,  monitoring  system  of  state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs), public sector wages and salaries, and debt service liabilities \nof public organizations. Finance Division staff helped finalize these studies, which \nwere then examined during workshops and used in training programs. These \nstudies have enabled the Finance Division to conduct policy dialogue with other \nagencies. An action plan on the basis of the studies' recommendations was \nformulated for implementation.  \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 28 August 2002. \n2 TA No. 1274-BAN: Institutional Support to the Ministry of Finance, for $600,000 approved on 27 February 1990 and \n  TA No. 3066-BAN: Efficiency Enhancement of Fiscal Management, for $700,000 approved on 10 September 1998.  ", "2 \n \n(iii)  Three officers from the Economic Adviser\u2019s Wing (EAW) of the Finance Division \nwere placed full-time under the Project, and the long-term national consultants \nimparted rigorous on-the-job training.3 The officers took over the responsibility to \nprepare  various  management  reports  developed  under  the  TAs  to  support \ninstitutional needs. A local area network (LAN) has been set up under the TA, \nconnecting the Budget Wing, Development Wing, Nontax Cell, Monitoring Cell, \nEconomic Adviser\u2019s Wing, and the Project Office. \n \n(iv)  Various  weekly,  fortnightly,  and  monthly  management  reports  were \ninstitutionalized  in  MOF.4  The  TAs  helped  the  Finance  Division  prepare  the \nbudget and post-budget economic reviews and in undertaking dialogue with the \ndevelopment partners, including the World Bank, International Monetary Fund \n(IMF), and ADB. \n \n5.  ADB-assisted initiatives have considerably enhanced the Finance Division's institutional \ncapabilities. An operational framework has been developed to conduct research and analysis on \nstructural reforms and policy changes based on a clear understanding of macroeconomic and \nsectoral  implications.  Still,  the  analytical  framework  cannot  be  fully  institutionalized  as  the \nFinance Division lacked adequate professional staff with requisite training in macroeconomics \nand fiscal policy analyses. The CGE model developed under the earlier TAs is now outdated, \nand ineffective in meeting the changing needs of the Finance Division to conduct simulations in \nmonetary, fiscal, and external sector policies. The present FORTRAN-based solution program is \nnot user-friendly and cannot meet the new requirements.5 The absence of proper organizational \narrangements in the Finance Division also impedes internalization of the analytical framework. \nThe Finance Division's institutional structure is not effective in coordinating the analytical needs \nof different functional wings and providing feedback, assimilating the analytical outputs and \napplying them as policy inputs, and identifying needs for updating and refining policy actions. \nAlthough a number of Finance Division officers now have access to computers, only a few are \nconnected through LAN and have Internet facilities, which hampers coordination among officials \nand their operational efficiency.  \n \n6.  The  Finance  Division  is  also  inefficient  in  several  other  areas  of  fiscal  and \nmacroeconomic  management.  Remittances  from  overseas  workers  are  the  most  important \nsource  of  external  resource  inflows,  after  earnings  from  merchandise  exports.  Because  of \ninefficiency in sending remittances through official channels, a sizable part is sent through \nunofficial routes. SOEs drain the national exchequer. The Finance Division lacks the capacity to \nassess the budgetary implications of performance and divestiture of SOEs. The SOE monitoring \nsystem needs improvement in several areas to generate more reliable and updated key SOE \nperformance indicators, and to design and develop appropriate SOE performance contracting \nsystems.   \n \n7.  Considering that the issues are institutional, the Finance Division needs more support \nand assistance to sustain the accomplishments under the earlier TAs in fiscal management and \nto strengthen the division\u2019s capacity in other important areas. Assistance is needed in updating \nmodeling expertise, addressing institutional weaknesses in the analytical framework, developing \n                                                 \n3  Two are still working in TA 3066-BAN: Efficiency Enhancement of Fiscal Management.  \n4  These include a monthly report on Government\u2019s borrowing from the banking system, monthly report of fiscal \nsituation, and Fortnightly Economic Trends.  \n5  FORTRAN = Formula Translation.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The ADTA will enhance the Finance Division's ability to analyze fiscal, monetary, and \nexternal sector policies efficiently and effectively. The ADTA's purpose is to improve the quality \nand  timeliness  of  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  policy  analysis.  The  ADTA's  expected  major \noutputs  are  (i)  improved  institutional  arrangements  for  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  policy \nanalyses, (ii) upgraded CGE modeling expertise, (iii) improved SOE monitoring systems, (iv) an \nefficient  system  for  remitting  overseas  workers\u2019  earnings,  and  (v)  upgraded  professional \nexpertise in macroeconomics and fiscal policy analysis. The ADTA will enable the Finance \nDivision to better assess the benefits and costs of various policy reforms, mobilize domestic \nresources and overseas workers\u2019 remittances, conduct policy dialogue with the development \npartners, and internalize an analytical framework. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The ADTA includes specialist assistance and other institutional support to enhance the \nFinance Division's analytical and research capabilities. The ADTA will accomplish the following: \n \n(i)  Analyze and address the Finance Division\u2019s institutional weaknesses by (a) \nconducting an institutional analysis of the Finance Division, (b) preparing an \naction  plan  on  institutional  arrangements  for  macroeconomic  and  fiscal \nmanagement, (c) helping implement the action plan, (d) providing analytical and \ntechnical  support  to  operate  a  permanent  policy  research  unit  (PRU)  in  the \nFinance Division, and (e) conducting in-house training for government officials. \n \n(ii)  Restructure and upgrade the CGE model by (a) making it more user-friendly \nand transferable, and (b) training officials of the Finance Division and other \nagencies to use the model. \n \n(iii)  Improve  the  SOE  monitoring  system  by  (a)  reviewing  and  improving  the \nsystem, (b) designing a computerized reporting system on SOEs' financial and \neconomic  performance,  and  (c)  designing  and  developing  SOE  performance \ncontracting systems. \n \n(iv)  Improve institutional arrangements in workers\u2019 remittance inflows by (a) \nassessing policies, regulations, systems, and procedures relating to overseas \nremittances;  (b)  suggesting  measures,  including  the  use  of  information  and \ncommunications technology, to enhance institutional effectiveness and efficiency \nto augment remittance inflows; (c) diverting remittances from illegal to official \nchannels;  and  (d)  identifying  other  areas  to  improve  inflows  of  workers\u2019 \nremittances. \n \n(v)  Upgrade  professional  expertise  in  macroeconomics  and  fiscal  policy \nanalyses  by  providing  a  customized  6-week  training  program  for  about  10 ", "4 \nFinance  Division  officials,  in  a  reputable  training  institute  in  the  region,  in \nmacroeconomics, fiscal, monetary, and external sector policies.   \n \n(vi)  Improve access to LAN and the Internet by (a) extending LAN through more \nworkstations with accessories and (b) providing Internet access to key Finance \nDivision officials. \n \n10.  The PRU will comprise qualified officers, nominated by the Finance Division secretary, \nfrom the budget, development, economic adviser\u2019s, expenditure control, and implementation \nwings. The PRU will be supervised by the Finance Division secretary and will plan and conduct \nthe division's substantive macroeconomic and policy analyses. The TA will provide the PRU with \nanalytical and technical support.  The consultants will be fielded after the PRU is set up. The \ninterface with other agencies, including Bangladesh Bank, Planning Commission, NBR, and \nBangladesh  Institute  of  Development  Studies  will  be  strengthened.  ADTA  activities  will  be \nclosely  coordinated  with  the  proposed  financial  management  reform  project  (FMRP)  to  be \nfunded by the Department for International Development, UK, and the Government of the \nNetherlands.6 At the ADTA's final stage, all systems/techniques/know-how developed will be \nincorporated into the Finance Division through various training programs and workshops.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The  ADTA's  total  cost  is  estimated  at  $750,000  equivalent,  comprising  the  foreign \nexchange cost of $405,000 and local currency cost of $345,000 equivalent. ADB will provide \n$600,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost of $405,000, and $195,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The ADTA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government will finance $150,000 equivalent to finance counterpart staff, \noffice facilities, and other administrative costs. The Government assured the availability of \ncounterpart services, facilities, and funds by the ADTA's expected commencement date. The \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The ADTA is expected to be implemented over 2 years commencing March 2003 and \nclosing February 2005. The Executing Agency will be Finance Division. Overall supervision and \nguidance of the ADTA will be the responsibility of a steering committee headed by the Finance \nDivision secretary and comprising representatives from Bangladesh Bank, Economic Relations \nDivision, Planning Commission, and different Finance Division wings. The steering committee \nwill meet every 6 months. A project implementation unit will be established in the Finance \nDivision, staffed by qualified and experienced counterpart staff, to facilitate ADTA planning and \nimplementation.  \n \n13.  The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. Two long-term domestic consultants, 24 person-months each, will be recruited \nindividually; 6 person-months of international and 7 person-months of domestic consultants from \nan  international  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged.  The  international  consulting  firm  will  be \nselected  in  accordance  with  simplified  technical  proposals.  ADB\u2019s  quality-  and  cost-based \n                                                 \n6 The overarching objective of the FMRP is to develop accountable and transparent institutional management and \noperational arrangements for aggregate fiscal discipline, strategic prioritization of expenditure, and improved \nbudget execution. ", "    5 \nselection method will be applied in selecting the international consulting firm. The consultants \nare expected to have extensive experience in macroeconomic and fiscal policy analysis or in \nother relevant areas. The outline terms of reference of consultants are in Appendix 3. The \ninternational  consulting  firm  will  also  develop  and  organize  a  customized  6-week  training \nprogram  for  about  10  officials,  in  a  reputable  training  institute  in  the  region;  and  procure \ncomputers,  server,  network  components  and  related  accessories,  Internet  facilities,  and \ncustomized software (according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement) to extend LAN and give \nInternet access to key officers of the Finance Division. Two long-term domestic consultants will \ncommence  work  in  March  2003  while  international  consultants  and  associated  domestic \nconsultants will be fielded from June 2003. Two long-term domestic consultants will submit \ninception,  midterm,  draft  final,  and  final  reports  within  1,  12,  20,  and  22  months  of  their \nappointment, respectively. The international consultants will be responsible for specific ADTA \nstudy reports. All the consultants' reports will be discussed at tripartite meetings. The equipment \nprocured under the ADTA will be handed over to the Executing Agency upon completion.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n14.
