", "     \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Tajikistan requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 2001 to \nprovide  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  governance  reforms  in  public  and  private \ninstitutions. The Government and ADB reached an understanding on the objectives, scope, and \ncost, financing, and implementation arrangements for the proposed TA during a Fact-Finding \nMission in August 2002. The TA is included in the 2002 TA program. The logical framework is in \nAppendix 1.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Civil conflicts as well as structural rigidities have delayed Tajikistan\u2019s transition to a \nmarket-oriented economy. As an indicator, total output in 2001 was only 43% of that in 1991. \nSince the resumption of peace in 1997, the economy has steadily been recovering and real \ngross domestic product (GDP) grew by 8.3% in 2000 and 10.3% in 2001. Inflation has gone \ndown from levels above 120% in 1997 to less than 40% in 2001. The foreign exchange rate has \nstayed relatively stable since the introduction of the somoni (TJS) in October 2000, (TJS1 \nreplaced 1,000 Tajik rubles). In 2000, the Government accelerated the privatization of state-\nowned  enterprises  (SOEs)  and  strengthened  tax  administration,  budget  management  and \ntreasury systems. Agriculture sector reforms are gradually under way. Yet growth opportunities \nremain limited with two principal products (aluminium and cotton) driving the economy, thus \nmaking it vulnerable to terms of trade shocks and poor harvests. The large volume of external \ndebt outstanding at 97% of GDP at end-2001 hinders medium-term growth. \n \n3.  As in the other small transition economies, the financial sector of Tajikistan remains \nsmall and nascent. The banking sector comprises 14 domestic commercial banks and 1 branch \nof a foreign-owned bank. At the end of 2001, the deposit base of the banking sector stood at \nTJS183 million ($76.4 million) or 7.3% of GDP, its assets amounted to 18.4% of GDP, while \nloans  accounted  for  15.5%  of  GDP.  Exhibiting  high  concentration,  the  four  largest  banks \naccount for 86% of the assets, 91% of loans, and about 95% of the deposits. Of the four, \nAgroinvest Bank, the largest, accounts for more than 80% of the outstanding loans.  \n \n4.  The Law on National Bank and the Law on Banks and Banking Activity (LBBA), adopted \nin 1992 and amended subsequently in 1998, along with a host of National Bank of Tajikistan \n(NBT) regulations, define the legal and regulatory framework governing the banking sector. \nWhile the laws give adequate authority to NBT, inconsistencies between these laws and the \nnew Civil Code adopted in 1999 have impeded effective regulation. Public confidence in the \nbanking system has been low and declining. Although NBT requires some evidence of financial \nstatus from shareholders, the legal and regulatory framework does not lay down stringent \ncorporate and financial governance (CFG) requirements. Specifically, there are no provisions \nwith respect to (i) representation of independent members on the board of directors (BOD); \n(ii) ongoing fit and proper, and financial disclosure requirements; (iii) establishment of obligatory \ncommittees of the BOD for risk management and director nominations; (iv) explicit fiduciary \nresponsibilities for members of the BOD or the management, to ensure depositors' interests are \nprotected; (v) rules on avoiding conflicts of interest by the BOD and the management; and \n(vi) non  preferential  treatment  given  to  transactions  with  related  parties  vis-\u00e0-vis  unrelated \nparties. \n \n                                  \n \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in September 2001. An updated version was published in \nAugust 2002. \n ", "2   \n5.  The SOE privatization and restructuring process have been gradual. Privatization is \ndefined as the sale, through auctions or tenders, of at least 75% of shares in SOEs. In 1991, the \nState had full ownership in 10,280 enterprises, of which 1,084 entities were not privatized given \ntheir strategic importance. Of the total, 8,562 were classified as small (less than 99 workers) \nand the remaining 1,718 were categorized either as medium size (100-199 workers) or large \n(more than 200 workers). A case-by-case privatization approach has been adopted for 1,127 \nenterprises and 294 farms. Substantial progress has been made with regard to small SOEs, \nwith 92% already privatized. However, medium-size and large SOEs have been privatized at a \nmuch slower pace due to overvaluation of government assets, vested interests impeding the \nprocess, social concerns, and high indebtedness of many enterprises. Of the 909 medium size \nand  large  SOEs  that  are  subject  to  privatization,  only  466  have  been  privatized  to  date. \nProgress has been made in the first half of 2002, when 100 medium-size and large SOEs were \nprivatized, compared with about 75 privatized on average per year over 1998-2001. \n \n6.  Besides LBBA, the key laws governing enterprises are the law on joint-stock companies \n(JSCs) adopted in 1991 and amended in 1998, law on securities and stock exchange adopted in \n1992 and amended in 1998, law on state enterprises (1993), the Civil Code (1999), and the law \non limited-liability companies (2002). While Tajikistan has a modern version of the Civil Code in \nrelation to its neighboring countries, which had adopted their civil codes at the turn of the \ntransition, its commercial laws are yet to be amended to achieve consistency with the Civil \nCode. The law on JSCs defines adequately the grounds for creating and liquidating companies, \nrequirements  regarding  charter  capital,  issuance  and  placement  of  securities,  and  some \nprinciples for disclosure. However, the JSC law lacks specific requirements on CFG. The law \nlacks  (i)  clarity  on  transactional  rights  and  obligations  of  the  BOD  and  the  management; \n(ii)   clear  rules  on  business  judgment  which  may  place  excess  liability  on  the  BOD  or \nmanagement and lead to inaction; (iii) provisions for fiduciary responsibilities on the part of the \nBOD  and  management  to  protect  the  interests  of  shareholders,  particularly  minority \nshareholders; (iv) clarity on the powers of majority shareholders to veto the decisions of the \nBOD  and  management,  without  due  course  to  a  general  meeting  of  all  shareholders; \n(v) adequate provisions governing valuation of shares, and conversion of categories of shares \n(for example, from preferred to ordinary shares); (vi) provisions for debt-to-equity swaps; and \n(vii) requirements on representation of independent directors on the BOD. \n \n7.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) has a State Department of Securities Market with a staff \nof only four officials responsible for monitoring over 1,000 registered JSCs. MOF also has a \nShare Registration Department that has registered the shares of about 600 JSCs thus far. While \nthe rules establishing these departments stipulate that they will function in an independent \nmanner, they are not self-sufficient and rely on support from MOF\u2019s operational budget. The \nGovernment does not have an independent body to oversee compliance with the provisions of \nlegislation pertaining to JSCs. \n \n8.  Tajikistan has the smallest capital market within the Central Asian region. The Central \nStock Exchange established in 1994 has not played any major role in developing the securities \nmarket. Privatization has not led to the development of a securities market, as most transactions \nhave been conducted through auctions or sale outside of an organized stock exchange. Much of \nthe auction process for sale of state property has taken place under the Republican Real Estate \nMarket, founded by the State Property Committee (SPC). The enterprises privatized, whether \nthrough auctions or purchase by strategic investors, have not yet initiated any new share issues. \nThere has been no formal secondary trading in the shares held by individual or institutional \ninvestors, although anecdotal evidence suggests that significant share trading does take place \ninformally. Trading in cotton and other commodities takes place at the Tajik Universal and Raw \nMaterials Exchange, established in June 2001.   ", "  3\n9.  SOEs  are  overseen  by  their  respective  sector  ministries.  The  SPC  confines  itself \nprimarily to privatization of state property, and does not have adequate capacity to undertake in-\ndepth  operational  reviews.  The  State  Agency  on  Anti-Monopoly  and  Support  for \nEntrepreneurship  (SAASE),  established  in  2000,  has  the  mandate  for  private  sector \ndevelopment and formulates competition policies and examines concentration of market power. \nWhile reforms have been under way to corporatize all SOEs reporting to various ministries as \nwell as to delink policy formulation and day-to-day administration, in reality governance in SOEs \nis weak and significant impediments remain through influence exerted by the line ministries. \nFurthermore, there is no regulatory authority to examine violations by SOEs of company laws or \ngovernance norms. \n \n10.  Operational and financial problems of privatized enterprises and SOEs exacerbate their \ngovernance  weaknesses.  An  assessment  of  the  reported  finances  of  about  350  SOEs, \nundertaken with support from the World Bank\u2019s second institutional building TA loan, reveals \nthat none of the enterprises have been operational over the last 3 years. With the exception of a \nfew engaged in aluminum production or raw cotton processing, enterprises in other sectors \nhave incurred consecutive losses. Most private JSCs as well as SOEs operate well below their \ncapacities, and anecdotal evidence indicates significant asset stripping by insiders. Inadequate \nand  expensive  means  of  financial  intermediation  have  stymied  effective  restructuring  or \nreorganization of assets. Moreover, the law on bankruptcy, adopted in 1993 and amended most \nrecently in 1998, is inadequate in many respects. In contrast to the bankruptcy legislation in the \nneighboring transition economies, the law in Tajikistan is much simpler, but it also lacks clear \nprovisions  with  regard  to  bankruptcy  determination  and  methods  of  reorganization,  among \nothers. In practice, only three cases of bankruptcy have been reported, and none has gone \nthrough the court system. Given the overall economic difficulties, enterprises are reluctant to \npursue  restructuring  or  bankruptcy  as  options.  In  the  absence  of  sound  asset  valuation \npractices, enterprises tend to inflate their assets to avoid bankruptcy, even if they had defaulted \non debt repayment or other obligations.  \n \n11.  The World Bank has actively supported restructuring of the banking sector under its first \nstructural adjustment credit in 1996,2 and privatization of enterprises under its second structural \nadjustment  credit  in  2000.3 ADB  has  supported  (i)  the  initial  phase  of  law  reform  and \ndissemination of legal information,4 and (ii) corporatization of key enterprises in the transport \nand energy sectors.5  \n \n12.  The United States Agency for International Development and the Swiss Development \nCooperation  Agency  have  provided  substantial  legal  and  judicial  training.  However,  no \nsignificant external support has yet been provided to assess the state of CFG in banks or \ncommercial enterprises, develop the corporate sector or to strengthen enterprise reorganization \nmeasures, for which the Government has requested the proposed TA. It will be implemented in \ncoordination with the work being done by the other aid agencies. The lessons emerging from \nthe ADB TA on law reform point to the need for (i) improving coordination of legal and judicial \nreforms, (ii) wider dissemination of laws, and (iii) training of lawyers and judges. The proposed \nTA will help disseminate the provisions of the law on bankruptcy and bankruptcy procedures \nwidely in the legal community through several training workshops. \n                                  \n \n2  Structural Adjustment Credit, approved on 30 July 1998, in the amount of $50 million. \n3  Structural Adjustment Credit \u2013 II, approved on 26 June 2001, in the amount of $50 million. \n4  ADB. 1999.

The goal of the TA is to strengthen CFG in Tajikistan. The purpose is to (i) strengthen \nthe  legal  and  regulatory  framework  with  regard  to  CFG  in  commercial  banks;  (ii) support \ncorporate  sector  development;  (iii)  enhance  institutional  capacity  to  undertake  enterprise \nrestructuring initiatives; and (iv) formulate reform directions to guide the Government in the \nareas of (i)-(iii).  \n \n14.  The outputs will include (i) revised legal and regulatory provisions on CFG in commercial \nbanks, CFG assessments, and recommendations to strengthen supervisory capacity in this area; \n(ii) training modules on corporate management; (iii) a developmental and regulatory framework \nfor the securities market; and (iv) capacity-building initiatives on bankruptcy and enterprise \nrestructuring aimed at enhancing the capacity of lawyers, judges, court officials, and special \nadministrators. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The TA will pursue activities in two areas. \n \n1.  Strengthen CFG in the Banking Sector \n(i)  Strengthen  CFG-related  provisions  in  LBBA  and  other  commercial  banking \nregulations, with specific focus on (a) effective management of various types of \nrisks; (b) fit-and-proper qualification requirements for principal shareholders and \nmembers  of  the  BOD  and  the  management; (c)  constitution  of  obligatory \ncommittees of the BOD for risk management, managerial compensation, and \ndirector  nominations;  (d)  presence  of  independent  directors  on  the  BOD; \n(e) establishment of an explicit fiduciary duty for banks, members of the BOD and \nthe management; (f) disclosure of the financial interests of members of the BOD \nand the management; (g) rules to avoid exploitation of conflict of interest by \ndirectors and managers; and (h) nonpreferential treatment of banks' transactions \nwith related parties. \n \n(ii)  Assess the current state of CFG practices in all commercial banks and formulate \nand introduce guidelines on CFG in all commercial banks, amend the internal \nregulations of NBT and strengthen supervisory procedures to effectively enforce \nCFG requirements, and help banks in implementing the guidelines. \n \n2.  Formulate a Sound Developmental Framework for the Corporate Sector \n(i)  Strengthen relevant provisions within the law on JSCs to improve CFG, and \nformulate a sound regulatory framework for JSCs.  \n \n(ii)  Strengthen the Law on Bankruptcy to facilitate efficient enterprise restructuring \ninitiatives and to expedite bankruptcy procedures. \n \n(iii)  Enhance the institutional capacity of the SPC to monitor progress with regard to \nbankruptcy;  and  give  training  on  bankruptcy  and  enterprise  reorganization \nprocedures  for  lawyers,  judges,  court  officials,  accountants,  special \nadministrators, and other finance sector professionals. ", "  5\n \n(iv)  Design and implement a pilot program covering at least 50 enterprises registered \nas  JSCs  to  (a)  train  senior  officials  in  modern  corporate  management,  and \n(b) formulate efficient operational or financial restructuring measures to enhance \nviability. \n \n(v)  Based on an assessment of the medium-term economic outlook and need for \nlong-term financing requirements, provide advisory and capacity-building support \nto the Government to design a developmental plan and regulatory framework for \nthe securities market.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $565,000 equivalent, of which $412,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $153,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $480,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$68,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance the balance of the \nlocal  currency  cost,  equivalent  to  $85,000,  through  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff  and \nworkshop facilities. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Spain. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will select and engage a firm using the quality- and cost-based selection method \nand a simplified technical proposal in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. Consulting services \nwill total 33 person-months (11 international, 22 domestic). Consultants will have expertise in \n(i) CFG legal and regulatory framework, (ii) corporate sector development and restructuring, and \n(iii) capacity building in bankruptcy procedures. The outline terms of reference for consulting \nservices are in Appendix 3.  \n \n18.  Given the overall focus on financial and corporate sector development, MOF will be the \nExecuting Agency for the TA and will implement the JSC development component jointly with \nSAASE and SPC. NBT will be the Implementing Agency for the banking sector component. The \nMinistry  of  Justice  (MOJ)  along  with  SPC  will  be  responsible  for  the  subcomponents  on \nbankruptcy procedures. A bankruptcy reform group will be established, with participation from \nSPC, MOJ, and MOF. To ensure effective coordination among all agencies, MOF will establish \na steering committee with participation from MOJ, NBT, SPC, and SAASE. The TA is expected \nto start in March 2003; it will be implemented over a period of 10 months.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $480,000 to the Government \nof Tajikistan to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Spain for Strengthening \nCorporate and Financial Governance Reforms, and hereby reports this action to the Board.     \n ", "6  Appendix 1   \nTECHNICAL
