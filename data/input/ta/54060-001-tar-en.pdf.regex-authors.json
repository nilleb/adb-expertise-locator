INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  improve  public  sector \nmanagement  (PSM)  practices  in  seven  Pacific  developing  member  countries  through \n(i) institutional strengthening of ministries of finance, other central management agencies, and \nrelevant sector ministries; and (ii) supporting tailored policy advice and targeted analysis to \npromote  longer-term  fiscal  sustainability  for  improved  growth  and  public  service  delivery.1  \nThe seven targeted countries are the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Niue, Samoa, Tonga, and \nTuvalu.2 The TA will also provide policy advice as requested to support the targeted countries \nduring disasters caused by natural hazards, such as cyclones and the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic. The TA will deliver (i) targeted assessments on PSM issues to inform \ngovernment  planning  and  development  partner  engagement;  (ii)  support  for  capacity \ndevelopment in PSM, with different focus areas depending on the country\u2019s need and absorptive \ncapacity; and (iii) policy advice and dialogue to strengthen governance mechanisms and prioritize \nand implement reforms. \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 operational \npriority of strengthening governance and institutional capacity, accelerating progress in gender \nequality,  and  fostering  regional  cooperation  and  integration.3  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  also \nemphasizes a differentiated approach for small island developing states, given their unique \nstructural constraints and vulnerabilities. Common areas for support in these countries are public \nprocurement, tax administration, and state-owned enterprise (SOE) management. However, the \napproach to delivering support depends on the government\u2019s appetite for change, absorptive \ncapacity, accessibility to technology, and platforms for communication. Under Strategy 2030, ADB \nsupports institutional strengthening in small island developing states to help enhance public \nservice delivery, improve the business environment, and promote private sector-led growth.  \nThe TA also reflects the Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020 strategic priority of managing risks through \nPSM operations that support country efforts to manage financial and economic risks.4 The TA is \nlisted in the Regional Operations Business Plan, 2020\u20132022.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Development context. The targeted countries are some of ADB\u2019s smallest and most \nisolated developing member countries. With a combined population of over 1.3 million, dispersed \nover 7.8 million square kilometers of ocean (larger than the size of Australia), these countries face \nunique development challenges that hinder their growth. Among the targeted countries, relatively \nmore developed economies, such as the Cook Islands and Fiji, depend on tourism, while others, \nsuch as Kiribati and Tuvalu depend on fishing revenues. Regardless of size and growth drivers, \nthese Pacific economies share similar challenges\u2014distance from markets, lack of resources (land \nand human capital and natural resources), limited capacity to manage their large oceans, and \nvulnerability to external shocks, including epidemics, financial crises, natural disasters, and \nclimate change. COVID-19 has dampened the economic outlook for many targeted countries with \n \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) defines PSM in seven areas: public expenditure and fiscal management, \neconomic affairs management, public administration, reforms of SOEs, decentralization, law and the judiciary, and \nsocial protection. https://www.adb.org/sectors/governance/overview. \n2  This TA covers seven Pacific member countries that are assisted through the Pacific Subregional Office in Suva, Fiji.  \nPSM in other Pacific countries are supported by similar TA programs. \n3  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n4  ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n5  The  TA  first  appeared  in  the  business  opportunities  section  of  ADB\u2019s  website  in  December  2019. \nhttps://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/545316/robp-pacific-2020-2022.pdf. \n ", "2 \nsubstantial loss of revenue expected in tourism and a recession in 2020 projected by ADB\u2019s Asian \nDevelopment Outlook and the International Monetary Fund\u2019s World Economic Outlook April 2020. \nThe countries distance from markets results in high costs of service delivery. Their limited \nresource base causes heavy reliance on volatile revenue sources. Their governments and SOEs \ndominate  economic  activities  and  service  delivery,  while  their  capacity  is  limited.  Hence, \nstrengthening the capacity of ministries of finance and other oversight institutions is critical for \nthem to deliver services effectively while managing their limited resources well. \n \n4.  Impacts of COVID-19 highlight structural issues. The pandemic impacted the targeted \ncountries in various ways, hitting hardest on the tourism-dependent countries\u2014the Cook Islands \nand Fiji. In Fiji, 28,000 tourists arrived between January and March 2020 compared with 60,000 \nvisitors for the same period in 2019. As a result, 40,000 workers in the hospitality industry became \nunemployed. Fiji, as the main hub of the region, was also the only country from the targeted \ncountries that recorded confirmed COVID-19 cases (18, or 0.002% of Fiji\u2019s population). Although \nlow, the ripple effect of closing borders led to a drop in economic activities, mainly in tourism, and \nlowered growth prospects. Most governments launched stimulus packages to support business \ncommunities and ordinary citizens who lost their jobs. Delays in procuring and mobilizing essential \nmedical equipment highlighted issues with government systems. The PSM support complements \nexisting analytical work and informs short- to medium-term policy measures for COVID-19. \n \n5.  Weak policy and legal framework. Over the last 5 years, the targeted countries have \nmade considerable efforts to improve PSM and strengthen alignment with national development \nplans. However, challenges persist because the outdated policy and legal frameworks for PSM, \nincluding public financial management (PFM), do not effectively support progress in the national \npriorities  of  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  especially  in  sustaining  reforms  and \nmaintaining progress along multiyear reform plans to develop regulations and implement PFM \nlegislative updates. \n \n6.  Public sector management challenges. The targeted countries received various PSM \ndiagnostics studies\u2014public expenditure and financial accountability assessments, assessments \nof national systems, and public expenditure reviews. These assessments prioritize managing \nfiscal  risks,  including  expenditure  controls,  strategic  allocations  of resources  (planning  and \nbudgeting), accounting and procurement practices, and SOE management. Impacts of COVID-\n19 resulted in job losses and increased the vulnerability of marginalized groups. Weak PSM \nhampers optimizing public infrastructure investments in transport, energy, water supply and \nsanitation. Overall, weak PFM increases the already high costs of delivering essential public \nservices.  These  challenges  are  exacerbated  by  thin  institutional  capacity  and  poor  human \nresource management, particularly in line agencies with limited oversight capability. \n \n7.  Weak domestic resource mobilization and debt management.6 Public service delivery \nis costly and requires steady financing in the targeted countries. A challenge is ensuring sufficient \nresources for adequate public service delivery while managing debt sustainably. Central agencies \nvary in their capacity to mobilize revenue and manage public expenditure. In Fiji, a dedicated \ninstitution, the Fiji Revenue and Customs Service, has over 100 staff, whereas smaller countries \nsuch as Tuvalu have fewer than 10 staff to handle such work. The structure of how these functions \nare managed differs across countries and poses various challenges. In most targeted countries, \n \n6  ADB defines  domestic  resource  mobilization  as measures  to  support  fiscal  consolidation; improve  revenue \nmanagement; strengthen public expenditure management; enhance the generation of domestic savings; and \nincrease private resource mobilization for investment opportunities, especially for micro, small, and medium-sized \nbusinesses. https://www.adb.org/sectors/governance/issues/domestic-resource-mobilization. \n ", "3 \nthe fiscal risk is high because public spending depends on volatile non-tax revenue sources\u2014\nfishing licenses, remittances, and tourism. Recognizing this, governments have implemented \nprograms to improve budgeting and tax administration with support from development partners, \nbut there is still room to strengthen tax administration and debt management. \n \n8.  Thin capacity to manage state-owned enterprises. Despite the importance of SOEs in \nthese economies, oversight of SOEs is often weak because of limited capacity, lack of clarity on \nthe SOE noncommercial objectives, and political influence in operations. Government capacity to \nmonitor  SOE  is  severely  stretched.  For  example,  in  Kiribati,  the  SOE  Monitoring  and \nAdministration Unit of two staff manages a relatively large portfolio of over 15 SOEs plus other \nresponsibilities, including the large sovereign wealth fund (Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund). \nIn the targeted countries, sustained support to (i) strengthen institutions to better formulate policy \nand manage operations and (ii) build capacity on economic and financial analysis and reporting \nis critical to ensuring that the SOEs are accountable for delivering efficient services. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  TA  is  aligned  with the  following  impact:  delivery  of  public  goods  and  services \nenhanced. The TA will have the following outcome: efficiency and effectiveness of public resource \nuse improved.7 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Quality public sector management assessments supported.8 The TA will \nhelp the targeted countries conduct needed diagnostic studies and facilitate policy dialogues. The \nassessments will help to scope and design practical reform measures to improve PSM practices \nto effectively deliver public services. Based on potential reform measures generated from these \nassessments and dialogues, ADB will lead engagement with governments to set priorities, which \nmay be supported through policy-based operations. The TA will produce briefing notes, analytical \nreports, and background information to support these PSM activities. ADB, with experts\u2019 support, \nwill  discuss  the  scope  of  subregional  or  country-specific  diagnostic/assessments  with \ngovernments to ensure that topics are relevant and add value to sustainable public investments \nand reforms. The TA also aims to enhance strategic policy dialogue between ADB, governments, \nand partners. The TA will define areas of assessment and policy advice in consultation with each \ngovernment, taking into consideration future ADB programs and the potential to share the learning \nmore widely. The TA will develop a dissemination strategy in the first year of implementation to \nsupport this. \n \n11.  Output 2: Capacity of the governments\u2019 central oversight and planning agencies \nstrengthened. The TA will provide high-quality guidance and capacity-strengthening support to \nthe ministries of finance, central planning agencies, and relevant sector ministries to implement \nrecommendations from PFM road maps and/or other PSM assessments. This could also include \nassessments of COVID-19 impacts to inform management of stimulus packages. Experts in \naccounting, internal audit, procurement, economic planning, human resource management, SOE \nmanagement,  tax  administration,  and  debt  management  will  work  alongside  government \ncounterparts to build their technical know-how and empower them to lead the prioritization, \n \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n8  Depending on the needs of the member country, this may involve specific PFM assessment to support a project. \n ", "4 \nsequencing, implementation, and monitoring of PSM reforms. Lessons from reforms on public \nprocurement in one country, will be replicated and utilized in other countries to increase cross \nlearning. As part of this process, the experts will deliver a mix of capacity-building support \ninvolving workshops, group discussions, and on-the-job training to strengthen the capacity of \ncounterparts on PSM, including COVID-19 response. These activities will improve strategic \nplanning, policy discussions, and coordination in the targeted countries based on existing efforts \nin line with their PSM reform agenda. \n \n12.  Output 3: Public sector management reforms prioritized and implemented. ADB\u2019s \nactive role in PFM discussions has made ADB a partner of choice to support reform efforts and \nbroader PSM issues. Through tailored assessment and capacity building, the TA will  help \nprioritize and implement public sector reform. Insights from assessments will inform policy advice \nand dialogue between ADB and targeted countries to strengthen governance mechanisms. The \nTA will provide tailored capacity-building and advisory services on a short-term and medium-term \nbasis to help effectively implement priority reforms to strengthen fiscal management, public \nadministration, and SOE management, thus helping governments better prioritize and implement \nreforms. \n \n13.  The proposed solutions build on lessons from previous ADB policy-based operations and \nTA that supported PSM reforms,9 including a series of independent evaluations of ADB public \nsector operations.10 Lessons include (i) building on ownership for reform, (ii) building on existing \nefforts,  (iii)  accommodating  the  political  economy,  (iv)  carefully  timing  the  intervention, \n(v) employing participation and building consensus, (vi) incorporating the need for capacity and \ninstitutional development, (vii) keeping the design simple and allowing for flexibility in the design, \n(viii) sequencing reforms, and (ix) monitoring progress. It is critical not to just adopt PSM solutions \nfrom developed countries and try to replicate them with low levels of public administration. Rather, \nthe culture and quality of management are key elements in designing the program.11 Where \nappropriate,  climate  change,  disaster  risk  management,  and  gender  considerations  will  be \nincorporated into policy advice, technical support, and training. The proposed program aims to \nenhance  partnership  and  collaboration  on  PSM  support  to  improve  coordination,  flow  of \ninformation, networks, and cross learning across governments and development partners. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,150,000, of which (i) $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF  6: $1,000,000  and  TASF-other \nsources: $500,000); and (ii) the equivalent of A$1,000,000 ($650,000 as of 14 May 2020) will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of New Zealand and administered by ADB. \nCofinancing from New Zealand will support experts on SOE and PFM for Kiribati only.

The TA will also support development partner coordination through facilitating \ncofinancing and joint analytical work. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA. As the executing agency, the Pacific Subregional Office of \nADB\u2019s Pacific Department (PARD), in consultation with participating countries, will select, deploy, \nsupervise, monitor, and evaluate consultant\u2019s performance. ADB\u2019s main government counterparts \nwill be the ministries of finance in the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Niue, Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu. \nThe  Pacific  Subregional  Office  will  coordinate  implementation  across  ADB  operations  and \ndevelopment partners involved in PSM reform in participating countries.12 \n \n17.
