The Asian Development Bank (ADB), through the South Asia Regional Cooperation Strategy \nand Program (2006\u20132008)1 has reaffirmed its commitment to supporting regional cooperation in \ntourism with significant capacity to contribute to sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the \nsubregion.  A  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Improving  Connectivity  and  Destination \nManagement of Cultural and Natural Resources in the South Asia subregion has been included in \nADB\u2019s 2008 assistance pipeline. The TA concept was first discussed with all participating countries at \nthe ninth meeting of the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) tourism working \ngroup (TWG)2 in Delhi in May 2008. Subsequently, ADB missions visited Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, \nand  Nepal  to  further  discuss  and  finalize  the  scope,  costs,  financing,  and  implementation \narrangements of the TA. The proposed TA3 forms an important intervention in the process of a long-\nterm partnership between ADB and the TWG countries for developing environmentally- and culturally-\nsustainable, and socially inclusive tourism to catalyze economic growth and reduce poverty in the \nsubregion. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  South Asia is one of the poorest regions of the world. However, the region has rich and \ndiverse natural and cultural heritage assets and major Buddhist sites, positioning it as a Buddhist \nheartland and one of the most attractive nature- and culture-based tourism destinations in the world. \nThe region has tremendous potential for developing tourism that can be used to expand economic \nopportunities,  generate  employment,  and  raise  incomes,  particularly  for  the  subregion\u2019s  poor. \nHarnessing the full potential of tourism in the subregion requires coordinated approaches to tourism \nexpansion  and  integrated  development  and  promotion  of  the  subregion\u2019s  tourism  assets  by \nparticipating countries.  \n \n3.  Since the formation of the TWG in 2001 under the SASEC Program, ADB and TWG countries \nhave identified tourism as one of the priority areas for cooperation. In 2004, the TWG, with ADB \nsupport, prepared and adopted a subregional tourism development plan that provided a strategic \nframework for coordinated tourism initiatives among participating countries. More recently, the TWG \nperceived the need for more tangible outcomes and requested ADB\u2019s financial support for the joint \ndevelopment of tourism infrastructure. An ADB-funded regional TA,4 which was implemented recently, \ndeveloped a tourism infrastructure road map comprising a number of multi-country tourism circuits as \na framework for phased infrastructure development. The TA determined the overall infrastructure \nrequirements in these multi-country tourism circuits and undertook a prefeasibility evaluation of priority \nsubprojects along the high-potential circuits, with a focus on the subregion\u2019s Buddhist heartland and \nnatural and cultural heritage sites. The purpose of the integrated development of multi-country tourism \ncircuits is to link the complementary and contiguous tourism attractions of the subregion\u2019s countries \nthat otherwise might not be sufficient to attract high levels of tourist arrivals on an individual basis. \nADB  has  already  initiated  the  processing  of  the  subregional  investment  project  (the  Project)  5 \ncomprising high-priority investments along the selected multi-country circuits. However, advanced \nlevels of cooperation in tourism and the integrated development of tourism infrastructure in multi-\ncountry circuits need to be supported with a number of additional complementary interventions.  \n \n4.   Need to Sustain Cooperation in Subregional Tourism Development. There is a need to \nsustain cooperation in tourism in the subregion beyond the proposed TA and the forthcoming Project. \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2006. South Asia Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program (2006\u20132008).Manila                                                                        \n2  The South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation TWG includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India\u2019s north and northeastern \nstates, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.   \n3   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on October 2008.  \n4  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Tourism Development Project. \nManila (TA 6362-REG, approved on 13 December, for $1.0 million).     \n5  The \u201cProject\u201d refers to the subregional loan/grant project for \u201cImproving Connectivity and Destination Infrastructure for \nSubregional Tourism Development\u201d for which loan fact-finding missions were completed. \n ", "   2 \nThe subregional tourism development plan of 2004 proved to be an effective instrument in facilitating \ncooperation and coordinated tourism actions towards common goals in the subregion. However, there \nis a need for periodic adjustments to the plan in order to maintain its relevance in the context of the \nevolving needs as highlighted by the eighth TWG meeting in 2007. Adjustments to the plan are \nrequired in light of a new stage of subregional cooperation for joint infrastructure development and to \nincorporate the findings of the recent TA, especially the subregional tourism infrastructure road map \nthat was developed and endorsed under the TA.  \n \n5.   Need to Streamline Cross-Border Tourist Movement. While many of the key border points \nbetween the participating countries and on the selected multi-country circuits are open to tourist travel, \nand subregional tourism growth is not directly dependent upon immediate action to facilitate cross-\nborder travel, the benefits will significantly increase in the long run if cross-border travel is further \nstreamlined. Possible actions to promote cross-border travel include, depending on the specific border \npoint, streamlining visa issuance procedures, facilitating tourist vehicle movements, and coordinating \nborder opening times and duration. The participating countries recognize these issues and they are at \nvarious stages of addressing them. There is a need to (i) continue constructive dialogue among the \nTWG countries to address issues that potentially could hamper realization of the full benefits of \nintegrated development of multi-country tourism circuits, and (ii) develop an agreed-upon plan of \ncoordinated action to facilitate cross-border tourist movement.  \n \n6.  Need for Subregional Action for Market Expansion. The viability of the Project and other \ninvestments being made to enhance subregional tourism will ultimately depend upon the number of \nvisitors to the subregion, which will, to a significant extent, be influenced by the level of the target \nmarkets\u2019 awareness of the subregion\u2019s tourism assets. The TWG countries recognize this and have \nsupported subregional marketing initiatives in the past. There is a need for continuous and collective \nmarketing and promotion of the subregion as a unique destination. This is especially important for the \nmulti-country tourism circuits to be developed under the forthcoming Project. The statistics show that \nmany tourists are combining several countries in their trip to the subregion, which is the primary \nrationale for supporting multi-country circuit development under the forthcoming Project. There is a \nneed to develop measures to complement ongoing interventions to enhance  demand from current \nand new markets for existing and potential multi-country circuits, and the subregion as a whole, \nespecially high-value Western and Asian markets, and domestic and intraregional markets.   \n \n7.  Need for Subregional Knowledge and Experience Sharing. While there are substantial \ncapacity constraints to protecting, developing, managing, and promoting tourism destinations and \nassets of cultural and natural importance in the subregion, there are also specific examples of good \npractices that can be used for further replication, including the excellent management of sensitive \ndestinations such as natural and cultural heritage sites. In some cases, community\u2013government\u2013\nindustry partnerships are promoted to support the development of inclusive and sustainable nature-\nbased tourism. There is also widespread enthusiasm for sharing knowledge and experience among \nthe participating countries. There is a need to complement national-level, capacity-building efforts with \nsubregional experience and knowledge-sharing activities that focus on sustainable and inclusive \ndevelopment and management of nature- and culture-based tourism destinations.  \n \n8.  Need to Enhance Preparedness for the Subregional Investment Project. There is a need \nto assist the participating countries to enhance their capacity and readiness for implementing the \nforthcoming Project, both at the subregional and national levels. Implementation of the Project will \nrequire  formation  of  a  subregional  task  force\u2014comprising  members  of  the  TWG  and  key \nimplementing  agencies  of  the  Project\u2014to  monitor  and  provide  policy  guidance  on  project \nimplementation. Support is needed to enable to the task force to perform its mandate. In addition, \neffective  and  timely  implementation  of  the  forthcoming  Project  will  require  support  for  individual \ncountries to enhance their project management and implementation capacities, and to undertake \nproject start-up activities in a timely manner. There is a need to provide bridging assistance to the \nparticipating countries for enhanced project preparedness.  \n \n ", "3 \n9.  At this stage of subregional cooperation in tourism, and given the demonstrated efforts of \nparticipating countries to cooperate on joint infrastructure development, there is need for further \nsupport to enable continuous and focused subregional dialogue, and ensure the effectiveness of the \nforthcoming Project. The TA is required to (i) enable sustainable cooperation among participating \ncountries for subregional tourism development; (ii) promote dialogue and actions for streamlining \ncross-border tourist travel; (iii) assist in collective marketing and promotion of the subregion\u2019s tourism \nassets, with a greater focus on the multi-country tourism circuits that will be developed under the \nProject;  (iv)  provide  for  subregional  experience  and  knowledge  sharing  for  stakeholder  capacity \nbuilding in the sustainable protection and management of natural and cultural heritage sites of tourism \nimportance, including exposure to innovative approaches (e.g., partnerships between community\u2013\npublic\u2013private sectors); and (v) help enhance the preparedness of the participating countries at both \nthe national and subregional levels for the timely and efficient implementation of the Project.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The expected impact of the proposed TA is the enhanced positioning of the subregion in both \nintraregional and international markets as one of the world\u2019s leading destinations for spiritual-, nature-, \nand culture-based tourism. This will be achieved by facilitating expanded subregional dialogue for \ncollective  action  and  capacity  building  for  enhanced  subregional  tourism  development  that  is \nenvironmentally- and culturally-sustainable, and socially inclusive.  \n \n11.  The expected outputs of the proposed TA are: (i) a deepened subregional dialogue guided by \nan updated and focused subregional tourism plan and action agenda; (ii) an increased awareness of \ncross-border issues and ongoing, concerted efforts based on a broadly agreed-upon plan of action to \nstreamline  cross-border  tourist  travel;  (iii)  enhanced  capacity  for  collective  marketing  of  the \nsubregion\u2019s  assets  and  ongoing  efforts  for  marketing  and  promotion  based  on  a  strategy  and \nexpansion plan that focuses on the selected multi-country circuits; (iv) improved capacities of the \npublic sector, communities, and the tourism industry for sustainable and inclusive management of \nnatural and cultural heritage sites and Buddhist circuits; and (v) enhanced preparedness of national-\nlevel stakeholders to manage and implement the Project in an effective and timely manner. The TA \nwill  include  the  TWG  countries,  i.e.,  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  Nepal,  and  Sri  Lanka  with  the \nexception of output (v), which will only include the TWG countries participating in the Project.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The proposed TA will include the following components.     \n \n13.  Support for Effective Subregional Cooperation. This component will strengthen the basis \nfor sustainable subregional cooperation. The subregional tourism plan of 2004 will be updated to \nmake it a living document. The plan will be realigned and its scope will be redefined to incorporate the \nfindings of recent regional TA and joint infrastructure development efforts based on a framework of \nmulti-country tourism circuits. An updated and focused tourism development matrix and action plan \nwill also be prepared in consultation with TWG members to provide an effective tool for use by the \nTWG to track the progress of coordinated efforts for advanced subregional tourism development.     \n \n14.  Streamlining  Cross-border  Tourist  Movement. This component will help in providing a \nplatform for dialogue and collective action among participating countries for smoother cross-border \ntourist movement. An assessment of non physical cross-border issues in each multi-country tourism \ncircuit will be made and discussed to raise awareness and garner support among the participating \ncountries to overcome obstacles. Options for solutions will be developed in consultation with and \nconsidering the ongoing plans and efforts of participating countries. An overall time-bound action plan \nand  individual  country  agendas  will  be  prepared  to  streamline  cross-border  tourist  movement. \nCoordination and synergies will be established with other relevant initiatives in the subregion. \n   \n ", "   4 \n15.  Action Plan for Market Expansion.  This component aims to ensure collective efforts for \nmarketing the subregion\u2019s tourism assets and especially the multi-country tourism circuits that will be \ndeveloped under the forthcoming Project. The  component will support (i) a market assessment and \nadditional research into new markets that build on existing market flows; (ii) marketing products and \ncommunications measures to enhance demand from current and potential new markets, especially \nhigh-value Western and Asian markets, and increase domestic and intraregional demand; and (iii)  a \ntime-framed marketing action plan and supporting institutional arrangements for implementation that \ngive special attention to the participation of the subregion\u2019s private sector. Some of the activities will \nlikely include: (i) developing a South Asia manual for the travel trade to feature the subregion\u2019s natural \nand cultural assets and give greater focus to selected multi-country circuits, (ii) a media and travel \ntrade familiarization program to promote the subregion\u2019s tourism assets, (iii) participation in selected \ntrade fairs and sales missions in source markets, (iv) sustained website management, (v) preparation \nof updated South Asia promotional materials, and (vi) design and implementation of a marketing and \npromotion monitoring and evaluation system to assess performance against key indicators.  \n \n16.  Subregional Experience and Knowledge Sharing. This component will support capacity \nbuilding and human resource development for ensuring (i) the sustainability of the natural and cultural \nheritage sites of tourism importance, with a greater focus on the multi-country circuits to be developed \nunder the Project; and (ii) increased cooperation among and benefits to the subregion\u2019s communities \nfrom the nature- and culture-based tourism interventions, including partnerships among the public and \nprivate sectors, and communities. The component will complement national-level capacity-building \nefforts  through  experience-  and  knowledge-sharing  activities,  including  study  tours,  workshops, \nseminars, and exposure to best practices within and outside the subregion. These activities will target \npublic sector officials, community leaders, and industry members who are collectively responsible for \nprotecting, developing, and managing the sites in selected multi-country tourism circuits.  \n \n17.  Enhanced Project Preparedness and Management. This component will promote effective \nmanagement and timely implementation of the Project. It will support the participating countries at the \nsubregional  and  national  levels.  At  the  subregional  level,  assistance  will  be  provided  to  the \nsubregional  task  force  that  will  be  formed  to  oversee  progress  and  provide  policy  guidance  in \nimplementing  the  Project.  The  task  force  will  be  supported  in  performing  annual  consolidated \nsubregional reviews of country components, advising as necessary on overall implementation issues \nand coordinating implementation of the Project with the proposed TA for consistency in intended \noutcomes. At the national level, support will be provided to the participating countries to develop their \ncapacity  for  project  management  and  to  undertake  project  start-up  activities,  including  advance \nactions for timely procurement as needed. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2.4 million. An amount of $2,000,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation \nand Integration Financing Partnership Facility. The governments of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, \nand Sri Lanka will provide $400,000 equivalent to cover the costs of counterpart staff and office \naccommodation and facilities in their respective countries. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  For all components listed above, except Enhanced Project Preparedness and Management, \nADB will execute the TA. The TWG and the subregional task force will act as the steering committee \nto oversee and guide TA implementation. The TA will be managed by ADB\u2019s South Asia Department \nUrban Development Division. National tourism organizations will be the TA focal agencies in each \nparticipating  country  responsible  for  providing  the  required  national  inputs  for  the  TA  and  will \ncoordinate  with  representatives  of  central  and  local  government  agencies,  nongovernment \norganizations, the private sector, and the tourism industry. For the component Enhanced Project \nPreparedness and Management, the focal agencies will include the following in each respective \n ", "5 \ncountry: Bangladesh, Department of Archeology; India, Sikkim\u2019s Tourism Department Nepal, Civil \nAviation Authority and Lumbini Development Trust.     \n \n20.  The  TA  will  commence  in  March  2009.  The  first  four  components  listed  above  will  be \nimplemented over 2 years until March 2011. Enhanced Project Preparedness and Management will \nbe implemented over 8 months until November 2009. The TA will require about 161 person-months of \nconsulting  services  (11  person-months  international  and  150  person-months  national).  ADB  will \nengage consulting firms and an individual consultant in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007 as amended from time to time). National tourism organizations will provide office \nspace  and  facilities,  and  suitably-qualified  counterpart  staff  for  the  consultants  to  support \nimplementation of the first four components and the subregional aspects of the Enhanced Project \nPreparedness  and  Management  component.    At  the  national  level  of  the  Enhanced  Project \nPreparedness and Management component, the key agencies involved in the implementation of the \nProject (listed in para. 19) will be responsible for providing office space, logistics, and counterpart staff. \n \n21.  A consulting firm, comprising a team of international and national consultants, will be recruited \nusing the quality- and cost-based method of selection to carry out the first four components. The team \nwill possess expertise in subregional tourism planning, marketing and promotion, travel facilitation, \nand  tourism-related  capacity  building  and  human  resource  development.  The  consultant  for  the \nEnhanced  Project  Preparedness  and  Management  component  at  the  subregional  level  will  be \nrecruited individually. An international tourism planner and infrastructure development specialist will \nbe engaged as a subregional tourism advisor to support the subregional task force during project \nimplementation.  At  the  national  level  of  the  Enhanced  Project  Preparedness  and  Management \ncomponent,  the  consultants  will  be  recruited  as  national  firms,  one  for  each  of  the  countries \nparticipating in the Project. The teams will posses expertise in project management, procurement, \nairport engineering, civil, electrical, and structural engineering, cultural heritage and conservation, \necotourism, community participation, and safeguards (See Appendix 3 for outline terms of reference). \n \n22.  The consultant team recruited to carry out the first four components will submit an inception \nreport containing an approach and work plan within 1 month of the start of the TA. This will provide \nlinkages with the Project to ensure consistency in outcomes. An interim report to be submitted within 6 \nmonths of the TA start will contain a (i) cross-border issues paper; (ii) position paper for revising the \nsubregional tourism plan; (iii) marketing strategy; and (iv) subregional training plan, including a needs \nassessment. The first annual report, which will be submitted within one year of the TA start and will be \nreviewed by the TWG and subregional task force, will provide (i) a revised subregional tourism plan, (ii) \nan action agenda for streamlining cross-border tourist movement, (iii) a market expansion plan, and \n(iv) an update on the status of subregional experience and knowledge sharing. The second year will \nfocus on implementation of action agendas and establish systems and procedures for uninterrupted \nimplementation of subregional agendas following the conclusion of the TA. Quarterly progress reports \nwill  be  submitted  in  the  second  year  followed  by  a  second  annual  report  documenting  all  TA \naccomplishments as compared to the original objectives and scope. The consultant recruited for \nEnhanced  Project  Preparedness  and  Management  at  the  subregional  level  will  provide  reports \noutlining the outcome of each annual meeting of the subregional task force, while the consultants for \nthis component at the national level submit an inception report, interim progress report, and a final \nreport within 1, 4, and 8 months of the TA\u2019s start respectively. Disbursements under the TA will accord \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, amended from time to time). \n  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION  \n23.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 for Improving Connectivity and Destination Management \nof Cultural and Natural Resources in the South Asia Subregion to be financed on a grant basis by the \nRegional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Fund  under  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration
