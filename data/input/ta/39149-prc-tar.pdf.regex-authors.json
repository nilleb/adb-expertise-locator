INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During the 2005 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) confirmed its request for technical \nassistance  (TA)  to  prepare  an  integrated  road  development  project  in  Guangxi  Zhuang \nAutonomous Region.1 ADB\u2019s Fact-Finding Mission visited the project area in January 2006, \ncarried out an initial poverty and social assessment and rapid environmental assessment, and \ncollected  other  information.  This  paper  is  based  on  the  understanding  reached  with  the \nGovernment regarding the TA objectives, scope, costs, consultants\u2019 terms of reference, and \nimplementation arrangements, as well as the Mission\u2019s observations in the field. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The PRC has achieved rapid economic growth and poverty reduction in recent decades. \nGDP has grown more than 9% per year since the 1980s, and the incidence of rural poverty fell \nfrom 33.0% in 1978 to just 2.8% in 2004. The PRC\u2019s sustained economic growth has resulted in \nan unprecedented expansion in traffic between and within provinces. The economy\u2019s changing \nstructure and increasing diversification have altered the pattern of transport demand. Demand \nfor road transport has outpaced that for other modes of transport. The movement of goods and \npassengers by road, which is more flexible and responsive to the needs of a market economy \nthan other modes of transport, is increasing rapidly.2 The shift in demand reflects the loosening \nof anticompetitive restrictions in the road transport industry. Large investments in automotive \nmanufacturing and the country\u2019s rapid economic growth have spurred the expansion of vehicle \nfleets at a pace that will likely be maintained in coming years. \n \n3.  Propelling  the  country\u2019s  robust  growth  and  drastic  poverty  reduction  were  massive \ninvestments in roads. The Government has made major efforts to increase road capacity to \nmeet the growing demand for improved access to markets and services. At the heart of the \ndevelopment of the road network is the National Trunk Highway System (NTHS), a 35,000-\nkilometer  (km)  system  of  interprovincial  expressways  and  high-class  highways  (target \ncompletion: 2007). The NTHS will be complemented by a network of national, provincial, county, \nand  township  roads.  The  Government  has  also  adopted  the  western  region  development \nstrategy (WRDS), a key theme of the 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2001\u20132005), to enhance \neconomic development in the western part of the country, where most of the poor reside. The \nstrategy, which aims to reduce the disparity between the western and coastal regions, assigns \nhigh priority to road sector development as a way to promote economic growth and poverty \nreduction in the western region. During the 10th FYP, the Government (i) accelerated the \nconstruction of a network of expressways and high-class highways, giving priority to five north\u2013\nsouth and seven west\u2013east sections of the NTHS; (ii) started the construction of highways in the \nwestern region totaling 18,000 km, including the eight western corridors; (iii) targeted opening \nabout 1.95 million km of highways to traffic, with expressways accounting for 35,000 km; and \n(iv) began to implement the 85,000 km national expressway network plan, slated for completion \nin 2040, with an annual investment of CNY100 billion to CNY150 billion. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities on 3 March 2006. \n2  From 1990 to 2004, road traffic grew by about 9.0% per year for passenger traffic, reaching 876.5 billion \npassenger-kilometers, and by 6.0% per year for freight, reaching 759.7 billion ton-km. In 2004, road traffic \naccounted for 53.7% of the PRC\u2019s total passenger traffic and 11.4% of its total freight traffic. \n ", "2   \n4.  As a result, the country\u2019s highway network grew from 1.16 million km in 1995 to 1.86 \nmillion km in 2004, for an average annual increase of 6%. Of this, 1.52 million km were \nclassified. The total length of expressways increased from 147 km in 1988 to 34,287 km in 2004, \nor over 100-fold. Class-I highways increased from 196 km in 1980 to 33,522 km in 2004, or 29% \nper year on average. Highways of class II and above accounted for 299,524 km, or 19.7% of the \ntotal  length.  County,  township,  and  village  roads,  which  the  Ministry  of  Communications \nclassifies as rural roads, totaled 2.9 million km in 2004.3 \n \n5.  Guangxi, in southern PRC, is one of the three least developed areas of the country. It is \nbordered by Yunnan province on the west, Guizhou on the northwest, Hunan on the northeast, \nand Guangdong on the southeast; the Gulf of Tonkin on the south; and Viet Nam on the \nsouthwest. The population of Guangxi exceeded 48.9 million in 2004, when the province\u2019s per \ncapita GDP was CNY7,196, or 77% of the national average. Of 81 counties in Guangxi, 49 are \npoor by either the national or provincial standard. The poor and the ethnic minorities are \nconcentrated in the northwest, where the project will be located. \n \n6.  Guangxi has strong links with the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries with \nregard  to  geography,  resources,  climate,  culture,  economy,  trade,  transport,  and  tourism.  \nGuangxi\u2019s border with Viet Nam is 637 km. Guangxi\u2019s trade with Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) countries has increased from $420 million in 2001 to over $1 billion in 2004, \nand comprises around 20% of its total foreign trade. Cross-border tourism is flourishing, with an \nestimated 2 million tourists crossing the Guangxi\u2013Viet Nam border in 2004. Fostering regional \ncooperation with other GMS countries is one of Guangxi\u2019s strategic objectives during the 11th \nFYP.  In  line  with  the  strategy,  Guangxi  gives  priority  to  establishing  transport  links  with \nneighboring provinces and countries. The proposed Longlin\u2013Baise expressway will be vital to \nregional integration, particularly through an integrated transport network. \n \n7.  The project is in the rural and mountainous territory of northwest Guangxi, which has \nlimited accessibility. The incidence of rural poverty is 24%; most of the population is made up of \npoor ethnic minorities. The project area consists of one city and two counties. About 80% of the \npeople live in rural areas. Ethnic minorities, mainly Zhuang, account for some 87% of the \npopulation. The area\u2019s remoteness and inadequate roads are among the main causes of the \narea\u2019s high poverty. \n \n8.  Traffic volume along the existing national highway, G324, has increased 7% yearly over \nthe last decade as a result of the area\u2019s economic growth and rising number of vehicles. \nHowever, the highway has poor geometrical and technical standards. More than 90% of G324 \nbetween Baise city and Longlin county is class III and in very poor condition. More than 80% of \nthe  road  has  steep  slopes,  narrow  sections,  and  sharp  turns.  Overloaded  vehicles  and \nnonmotorized traffic intrusions make matters worse. The high number of deaths and injuries \nresulting from accidents on G324 places a heavy burden on the health and welfare systems of \nthe poor counties in the project area. G324 will exceed its design capacity in 2007. The new \nhighway is thus urgently needed to meet traffic demand along the corridor. \n \n9.  The project will construct an access-controlled toll expressway of about 177 km from \nLonglin to Baise\u2014an alternative high-capacity route to G324. The project is a section of the \nShantou\u2013Kunming expressway, which is included in the Government\u2019s National Expressway \nNetwork Program and the GMS road network. Baise is at the junction of the Shantou\u2013Kunming \n                                                 \n3  Of the total rural roads, 479,372 km are county roads, 945,180 km are township roads, and 1,473,534 km are \nvillage roads. \n ", "  3\nexpressway and the Guangzhou\u2013Kunming expressway. The project expressway will connect \nNanning to the large cities in south PRC, such as Kunming and Guiyang, and thus promote the \neconomic integration of the east and west regions. The project will also support the WRDS, as \nwell  as  facilitate  communication  between  the  southwestern  region  and  the  Zhujiang  Delta \nEconomic Zone.  \n \n10.  The trip from Longlin to Baise along G324 takes 5\u20136 hours. The project expressway, \nwhich will be 45 km shorter, will cut travel time to less than 2 hours. By lowering transport costs \nand improving the frequency and quality of transport services, the project is expected to boost \neconomic activities, thereby helping reduce poverty in the area. Improved transportation will \nincrease income opportunities from cash-crop farming or migration, promote more contact with \nurban centers, and improve access to markets and social services. Consistent with ADB\u2019s \noperational strategy, the project will also spur trade between Guangxi and the GMS countries, \nincluding Viet Nam. \n \n11.  The project expressway will directly traverse Longlin and Tianlin counties, and Youjiang \ndistrict of Baise prefecture, all of which are poor by national and provincial standards. The \nproject  area  has  a  high  economic  potential,  as  it  possesses  abundant  water  and  mineral \nresources,  including  aluminum,  gold,  silver,  and  copper.  However,  inadequate  road \ninfrastructure has slowed down the area\u2019s development. In 2004, the per capita GDP of Baise \nwas CNY5,564\u2014only half of the national average. The per capita GDPs of Longlin and Tianlin \nwere even lower at CNY2,949 and CNY3,719. The per capita rural incomes of the city and \ncounties was CNY1,312, CNY1,501, and CNY1,814. Of the 53 townships in the project area, \n80% are rural. In 2005, 24% of the rural residents in the project area had a per capita income of \nless than CNY825. About 87% comprise six ethnic groups: Zhuang, Yao, Miao, Yi, Gelao, and \nHui. Because of difficult transport conditions, rural people in the area have to pay high rates for \nmotorized transport, have insufficient access to markets, and have little mobility beyond their \nimmediate communities. The main causes of the depressed economy and poverty in the project \narea are (i) the limited road access to markets where farming products are sold, and (ii) the \ninadequate delivery of road infrastructure and services. During the Fact-Finding Mission, the \ninitial poverty and social assessment reviewed the need for a comprehensive assessment of the \nsocial context and concluded that the key issues to be analyzed during project preparation are a \nfull  resettlement  plan,  an  ethnic  minority  development  plan  (EMDP),  and  the  project\u2019s \nsocioeconomic impacts. \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s operating strategy in the PRC\u2019s road sector is designed to remove infrastructure \nconstraints  and  support  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  Since  1991,  ADB  has  extended  \n32 loans totaling $6.4 billion to finance 4,455 km of expressways and 8,366 km of associated \nlocal road networks. To make ADB\u2019s road projects more pro-poor, the local roads have been \nincluded in project scopes since 1995. A portion of some ADB loans has been used to finance \nthe local road component.4 To promote pro-poor economic growth, ADB strategy extends its \noperations to the local roads. In line with ADB\u2019s policy dialogue, the project will finance the \nimprovement of transport network by constructing an expressway, and the improvement of local \nroads. ADB financing to the local road component will ensure the favorable distribution of the \nproject\u2019s benefits to the poor in the area. \n \n13.  The ADB strategy supports (i) the construction of the roads that connect major growth \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \ncenters with hinterland economies; (ii) the integration of the network, so that the major trunk \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n4  Ningxia  Roads  Development  Project,  Hunan  Roads  Development  II  and  III  Projects,  and  Guangxi  Road \nDevelopment II Project. \n ", "4   \nhighways are supported by a system of local roads, particularly those that provide access to \npoor areas; (iii) the adequate delivery of affordable transport services to the poor; (iv) adequate \nroad maintenance; (v) the promotion of road safety; (vi) private sector participation in the road \nsector;  (vii)  institutional  strengthening  to  increase  financial  and  managerial  efficiency  in \noperation and maintenance; and (viii) the adoption of pricing policies to ensure the optimum use \nof road transport capacity. \n \n14.  The feasibility study for the project was submitted to the Ministry of Communications and \nNational  Development  and  Reform  Commission  in  January  2006,  and  is  expected  to  be \napproved by July 2006. The preliminary design is expected to be completed by August 2006. An \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) was completed and submitted to State Environmental \nProtection Administration on 30 December 2005. The resettlement plan will be completed by \nMay 2006. The land-use plan was submitted to the Ministry of Land Resources in December \n2005. The initial poverty and social assessment and rapid environmental assessment carried \nout during fact-finding identified the key social and environmental issues that will need to be \nanalyzed further during project preparation (Appendix 2). \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n15.  The TA will help the Government prepare a road network development project to support \npro-poor economic growth and reduce poverty in the project area. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The TA will help Guangxi Provincial Communications Department (GPCD) in (i) refine \nthe feasibility study, including an EIA and summary EIA, a resettlement plan, and poverty impact \nanalysis  for  the  project,  in  conformity  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements;  (ii)  design  the  project  log \nframework, identify performance targets and socioeconomic impact indicators, and baseline \ndata,  and  establish  a  measuring  and/or  monitoring  mechanism;  (iii)  confirm  the  technical, \neconomic, and financial viability of the proposed investments; (iv) update transport and road \nprofiles; and (v) review the road sector issues and provide the basis for strengthening the \nongoing policy dialogue with the Government in key areas, such as the impact of road projects \non  poverty  reduction,  road  safety  and  vehicle  emissions,  local  road  maintenance,  public \ntransport  services,  intelligent  transport  system  and  asset  management,  and  private  sector \nparticipation in the road sector. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000, of which $360,750 is the foreign \nexchange component and the equivalent of $264,250, the local currency cost. ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram will provide a $500,000 grant to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and a portion of \nthe local currency cost ($139,250 equivalent). GPCD will finance the remainder of the total TA \ncost ($125,000 equivalent), which will be used to cover office accommodation and support \nservices, local communications, local transport, office supplies, and other facilities and services \nrequired to implement the TA. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. The Government \nhas been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  A team of international consultants, in association with one or more domestic consulting \nfirms, will be engaged, using the simplified technical proposal procedures based on the quality- \nand cost-based selection method, ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. \nThe TA will require a total of 29 person-months of consulting services, including 13 international \nand 16 domestic, to carry out the study, as defined in the outline terms of reference (Appendix \n4). The international consultants will provide expertise in (i) structural engineering, (ii) transport \neconomics, (iii) financial analysis and private sector participation in the road sector, (iv) poverty \nand socioeconomic analysis, and (v) environmental aspects. The domestic consultants will have \nexpertise  in  (i)  highway  and  structure  engineering,  (ii)  transport  economics,  (iii)  transport \nservices,  (iv)  financial  analysis,  (v)  socioeconomic  and  poverty  impact  analysis,  (vi) \nresettlement, and (vii) environment engineering.  \n \n19.  GPCD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA,  responsible  for  supervising  and \nmonitoring TA activities and liaising with government agencies and organizations. GPCD will \nalso provide office accommodation and transport arrangements. The fielding of consultants is \nscheduled  for  August  2006;  consulting  services  will  be  carried  out  over  5  months,  to  be \ncompleted in February 2007. GPCD will provide ADB and the consultants with the feasibility \nstudy; engineering studies; EIA; resettlement plan; and all other materials, recent studies, and \nreports required to implement the TA. The consultants will maintain close contact with the \nGovernment  and  GPCD,  and  keep  them  informed  of  the  progress  and  findings.  Tripartite \nmeetings involving GPCD, ADB staff members, and the consultants will be held in the PRC to \nadvise  and  guide  the  consultants  and  review  their  reports.  The  consultants  will  procure \nequipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n \n20.  The consultants will submit to ADB and GPCD (i) an inception report, including a survey \nimplementation  plan  with  a  proposed  questionnaire  for  socioeconomic,  resettlement,  and \npoverty-reduction impacts, 2 weeks after services start; (ii) an interim report, 10 weeks after \nservices start, which will provide a draft project log framework along with socioeconomic impact \nindicators and their baseline values, assess the need for an EMDP in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nPolicy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  and  present  an  initial  assessment  in  the  areas  of \neconomic, financial, and poverty analyses; (iii) a draft final report, the final project framework, \nsummary EIA, draft resettlement plan, draft EMDP, and draft social and poverty assessment \nreport, 14 weeks after services start; and (vi) the final report, summary EIA, resettlement plan, \nsocial and poverty assessment report, and EMDP, 2 weeks after receiving comments from ADB \nand GPCD.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China: The transport \nsector directly reduces poverty by improving access to markets, jobs, and social services, and indirectly by stimulating \neconomic development. Despite its good natural resources, the project area has lagged behind economically mainly \nbecause of lack of good transportation, which is limited to a class-II or -III highway. The project will link the Nanning\u2013\nBaise expressway (Asian Development Bank loan, under construction) to Guizhou province. It is also an important \nsection of the national expressway network. The expressway will reduce travel time and cost for passenger trips and \nfreight transport, thereby facilitating economic development, creating jobs, and improving access to social services.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe project area is in Baise prefecture, northwest of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. There are 12 counties \nand/or districts in Baise: 10 counties are listed as poverty counties by the national standard, and 2 counties and/or \ndistricts as provincial poverty counties. The poverty incidence in Baise is 6% (221,834 people) based on the absolute \npoverty line of CNY625 income per capita and 22% (809,900) based on the relative poverty line (CNY626 to CNY825 \nincome per capita). The poverty incidence in project area is 7.5% (104,633) based on the absolute poverty line, and \n23.5% (329,925) based on the relative poverty line.  \n \nThe project will directly reduce poverty by creating construction jobs in the short term and improving access to the \nmarket for cash crops. It will substantially improve transport infrastructure that will help develop local enterprises and \nthereby indirectly provide more local jobs and income-generating opportunities. The project will improve access to \nsocial services in the county centers and larger cities. Transportation is inconvenient and education and medical \nfacilities are very basic.  \n \nDuring  the  TA,  a  detailed  poverty  analysis  will  be  carried  out  to  identify  the  causes  of  poverty,  prepare  a \ncomplementary local road program, quantify how the project will help reduce poverty, and incorporate other social \nmeasures within the project scope. The TA will focus on the interventions\u2019 impact on the poor and disadvantaged, \nincluding the impact of enhanced provision of transport services. The analysis will be based on ADB\u2019s Handbook on \nPoverty and Social Analysis (2001) and Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects (2001). Poverty mapping will help determine the correlation between poverty, ethnic minority \nnationality, topography, and transport systems. Recommendations from the analysis will be considered for possible \ninclusion in project design. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes   No  \n \nStakeholder analysis: Key stakeholders include GPCD, local governments, transport companies, local businesses, \nand local residents. Consultation began during the preparation of the feasibility study. Further consultation will be \ncarried out for the EIA, resettlement planning, and poverty and social analysis. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?   Yes    No \n \nLocal communities and people will be consulted during preliminary design on expressway alignment, resettlement \npolicy, and compensation rates. They will participate in formulating village resettlement plans and poverty reduction \nmeasures. Local labor will help construct the expressway. Project components will also include linking roads and \npossibly public transport services. \n ", "Appendix 2  11\nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe TA will investigate opportunities to enhance the benefits to women through improved public transport service and \nlinking road improvements, which lead to better access to education, health care, and markets. Particular focus will be \nplaced on remote and minority villages, where females have limited skills for outside work. A gender analysis in line \nwith ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (2003) is required. Data will be disaggregated by gender. Ways of \nincorporating gender aspects or mitigating adverse impacts will be investigated for inclusion into the project design, \nmeasures for ethnic minorities, and/or the resettlement plan.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?
