I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Republic of Palau for the Water Sector Improvement Program.1 The program will support \nreform  of  the  water  and  sanitation  sector,  with  a  focus  on  improving  policy  and  legal \nframeworks, financial sustainability, and capacity development. \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n2.  Low water tariffs and high water consumption. Water tariffs in Palau are low by \ninternational standards. Average household expenditure for water by the residents of Koror and \nAirai is about 1% of average monthly household income, compared with the international norm \nof 5%.2 Sanitation services in Palau are provided free of charge. The low water tariffs do not \nencourage  prudent  water  consumption  of  treated  water. 3   Consumption  is  estimated  at \n169 gallons per person a day, or more than 5 times greater than in Asian countries. \n3.  High subsidies. The water and sanitation sector is the only utility service in Palau that \noperates  with  high  subsidies.  Power  and  telecommunications  services  have  already  been \ncorporatized and attract no government subsidies. Only 20% of the total operational cost of \nproviding water and sanitation services is recovered through water charges, with the balance \nsubsidized by the Government of Palau (government). The government\u2019s budget support for the \ndelivery of water and sanitation services for FY2010 of $2.4 million or 1.2% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) is similar to the government\u2019s FY2010 projected fiscal deficit. Water subsidies \nare  not  targeted  to  the  poor  and  disproportionately  benefit  wealthier  Palauans.4 The \ngovernment\u2019s objective is to eliminate subsidies in the sector by increasing charges to reflect \nthe full cost of supplying these services. This will help the government achieve its medium-term \nfiscal  target  of  a  5%  reduction  in  expenditure  over  the  next  5  years,  consistent  with  the \nInternational Monetary Fund\u2019s recommendations.5 \n4.  Water shortage may hinder tourism growth. Current demand projections show that \nwithout intervention, demand will exceed supply by 1.4 million gallons per day by 2020. Demand \ngrowth will be primarily driven by increasing tourist arrivals. Tourism is the largest private sector \ncomponent of the economy, accounting for almost half of the country\u2019s GDP. Tourist arrivals \nalready exceed 80,000 per year, or four times the national population and are projected to grow \nby an average of 4.4% per annum over the next 10 years. The resident population of Koror and \nAirai is projected to grow by 0.5% per annum. Yields from water sources for the Koror\u2013Airai \nwater supply are insufficient to meet current demand during periods of prolonged drought, \nexpected to intensify due to climate change. Improving the climate resilience of the water supply \nwould require the construction of a large reservoir at an estimated cost exceeding $25 million, \nwhich  is  not  financially  viable.  However,  efficiency  improvements\u2014including  demand-side \nmanagement and reduction of nonrevenue water\u2014are expected to remove the projected supply \ngap without adversely impacting tourism growth and associated private sector development. \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  About 14% of water provided in Koror and Airai is unmetered and incurs a flat fee. Metered connections are \ncharged at $0.85 per 1,000 gallons. Water tariffs in the Pacific range from $0.19 to $7.50 per 1,000 gallons.  \n3  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4  These subsidies disproportionately benefit Palau\u2019s wealthy, with 53% of all subsidized water delivered to those in \nthe top income quartile. Government of Palau. 2008. Household Income and Expenditure Report. Koror. \n5  IMF. 2010. Article IV Staff Report. Washington, DC. The report recommends the government reduce expenditures \nby 1.5% of GDP each year, in part through the elimination of subsidies. ", "2 \n5.  Fragmented responsibilities within the sector. The Koror\u2013Airai water supply system \nprovides treated water to approximately 77% of Palau\u2019s population living in Koror and Airai \nstates. The Koror\u2013Airai water supply system is operated and maintained by the Bureau of Public \nWorks  (BPW),  a  division  of  the  Ministry  of  Public  Infrastructure,  Industry  and  Commerce \n(MPIIC). BPW also operates and maintains separate systems in 14 states on behalf of the state \ngovernments.6  Multiple  agencies  are  responsible  for  water  supply  and  sewerage  service \ndelivery, with no agreed plan or central coordination. The capital infrastructure project unit of \nMPIIC is responsible for the design and development of infrastructure. The BPW is responsible \nfor water supply and sewerage treatment. The Ministry of Finance (MOF), Division of Utility \nCollections, is responsible for billing and payment collection. Currently, no agency is responsible \nfor  tariff setting,  infrastructure  investment,  and  planning. No  budget is  provided  for  capital \nexpenditure, as all public water infrastructure development since the Palau\u2019s independence in \n1994 has been financed by grants. The water sector maintenance budget is approximately 1.7% \nof the value of the assets, which is below the international norm of 2%. Many of the assets have \nexceeded their design life, and thus have no book value. \n6.  Inefficient operations and management. Operations are inefficient and losses are \nhigh, with nonrevenue water at 43% of production. Collection rates have historically been poor, \nat 60%\u201365% of billing. Management and organizational planning is limited. Maintenance is \nunder-funded, and not all needed technical skills are available. There is scope to improve \nperformance  within  the  sector,  but  this  will  require  an  overhaul  of  current  operations  and \nmanagement and the introduction of a capacity building program. Water and sewerage flow \nmetering to improve maintenance and leak detection, adjustment of the pricing of water and \nsewerage, and remedial programs will also improve efficiency.  \n7.  Inadequate  legal  and  regulatory  framework.  Current  legislation  is  outdated  and \nrequires  updating  and  consolidation  to  empower  a  new  water  and  sewerage  authority, \nparticularly in the areas of water abstraction and sewerage disposal, obligations for natural \nresource management, and rights of a utility to undertake its duties and functions as a water \nand sewerage services provider.  \n8.  Legislative changes need to reflect the government\u2019s commitment to reform in the water \nand sanitation sector, recognizing that tariff reform in the sector is critical to reduce demand and \nprovide a reliable, full cost-recovery service (footnote 6). This commitment is articulated in the \nMedium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS) 2009\u20132014,7 which was developed to support \nimplementation of the National Master Development Plan.8 The program supports the MTDS \ngoals and actions by (i) investing in the water and sanitation sector, (ii) moving state-owned \nenterprises toward full cost recovery, and (iii) reducing government expenditure by eliminating \nsubsidies. The Palau country partnership strategy, 2009\u201320139 supports the goals and actions \nof the government\u2019s MTDS and includes technical and financial support for sewerage sector \nplanning, improving water resource management, and water and sanitation sector infrastructure \ndevelopment. \n9.  The program also applies lessons from earlier ADB policy programs in the Pacific, as \nwell as ADB's approach to engaging with weakly performing countries, notably by (i) adopting a \ncountry-led set of policy actions developed in an open, participatory manner and at a pace in \n                                                 \n6  Sector Assessment (Summary): Water and Sanitation (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n7  Government of Palau. 2009.

The  impact  of  the  program  will  be  sustainable  water  and  sewerage  services.  The \nprogram outcome will be that the demand for water and sewerage services is met. \nC.  Outputs \n \n1.   Legal and Policy Framework for Water Sector Improvement is in Place \n11.  The program will establish the policy and legal framework to enable the provision of \nsustainable and efficient water and sewerage services by an independent, government-owned \ncorporate entity. The government is expected to pass an act that would create the Palau Water \nand Sewer Corporation (PWSC). The act will empower the PWSC, through an independent \nboard, to provide water and sewerage services throughout Palau and set tariffs for full cost \nrecovery.  The  draft  act  covers  (i)  the  transfer  of  physical  water  sector  assets  from  the \ngovernment  to  PWSC,  (ii)  the  transfer  of  the  existing  staff  from  the  relevant  government \nministries, and (iii) the right to collect and retain revenue and enter into debt. Regulations for \ndetailed operational issues have been prepared. The board will set its own bylaws. The draft act \nalso allows for outsourcing the management function to a private company of international \nstanding. The PWSC will meet external water and sanitation quality standards.  \n12.  Under the program, the government will increase the water tariffs in 2010 by regulation \nand establish a sewerage tariff for the first time. Further tariff increases will be required before \nthe PWSC is fully operational, and the government has committed to making these increases in \nFY2012 under the program. \n13.  During  program  implementation,  the  government  will  issue  policies  for  public \nmanagement of water resources (including a National Water Resources Management Plan) that \nincorporate the rights and responsibilities of water users in helping to manage the country\u2019s \nwater resources. The government will also seek changes to legislation to implement the plan \nand to further assist the sustainable management of Palau\u2019s terrestrial and marine resources \nincluding: (i) permits for water abstraction, (ii) issuing abstraction permits, and (iii) sewage \ntreatment and disposal.  \n \n2.  An  Independent  Palau  Water  and  Sewer  Corporation  Delivers  Improved \nServices \n14.  Transition  to  Palau  Water  and  Sewer  Corporation.  To  improve  the  operational \nefficiency and reduce the fragmentation of responsibilities in the sector, the PWSC will be \ncreated. The PWSC will be legally established including the appointment of a board and the \nboard\u2019s appointment of key staff. Over the next 12-18 months, the necessary regulations, \npolicies, and plans for the PWSC to be able to deliver water and sewerage services will be \nprepared.  These  will  include:  (i)  preparation  of  an  organizational  structure  to  deliver  the \nfunctions of the PWSC, (ii) finalization of an assets register, (iii) development of an asset \nmanagement plan, (iv) preparations to transfer current staff from the government to the PWSC, \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2009.

In  addition  to \nproviding  support  for  organizational  and  management-related  strengthening,  there  will  be \ncapacity building in technical management and planning, including through the development of \n(i) guidelines and technical standards, (ii) an infrastructure maintenance plan, (iii) an investment \nplan, and (iv) an institutional development plan. The program will provide ongoing technical \nsupport during this transition phase. \n15.  MPIIC will continue to deliver water and sewerage services while the PWSC is preparing \nto take full responsibility. When all preparations are complete, the President will declare the \nPWSC \u2018operationally effective\u2019 and the staff and relevant assets will transfer to the PWSC.   \n16.  Capacity building. A capacity-building program to help improve the effectiveness and \nefficiency of services will be implemented in early 2011 through the program. The capacity \ndevelopment program will initially be implemented within MPIIC Water and Sewer Divisions, and \nwill continue within PWSC when operations commence. Components of the capacity-building \nprogram  cover  (i)  mentoring  of  management  personnel,  (ii)  strengthening  administrative \ncapacity, and (iii) developing the technical skills of the water and sewerage operation teams. \nThe government will ensure PWSC is professionally managed and operated, and the draft \nPWSC act requires an experienced management team to be in place. \n17.  The program steering committee (PSC),11 MPIIC, and the program implementation unit \n(PIU) will manage and oversee the transitional activities. The PIU will contract external TA to \nhelp with the transition to, and capacity building of, the PWSC. This assistance will include \nexpertise  in  utility  management,  operational  management,  and  finance.  Once  operational, \nPWSC will be responsible for delivering water and sewage services in Palau. The government \nwill  continue  to  provide  budget  support  to  the  sector  until  the  PWSC  becomes  financially \nindependent by FY2015. Tariffs will be progressively increased to achieve full cost recovery \nduring this time.  \n18.  ADB technical assistance. To further support the capacity development of the PWSC, \nADB will utilize resources under an existing TA project to facilitate its transition to operational \neffectiveness.12 TA funds will help develop the maintenance, operations, and infrastructure \ninvestment plans.  \n19.  Improving Palau Water and Sewer Corporation operational efficiency. Consistent \nwith the MTDS\u2019s overarching goal of reducing costs and ensuring water conservation, the \ngovernment will set benchmarks for operational efficiency improvements. During transition to full \ncost recovery, PWSC will be expected to (i) reduce nonrevenue water from 43% to 25%, (ii) \nprogressively  increase  tariffs  to  achieve  full  cost  recovery  by  FY2015,  and  (iii)  improve \ncollections to at least 95% of billings by FY2015. The board will consider additional performance \nstandards for the PWSC. \n20.  To achieve these benchmarks, the PWSC will have to improve the efficiency of water \nand  sewer  sector  operations,  including  by  (i)  implementing  100%  consumer  metering,  (ii) \ndisconnecting all illegal connections, (iii) identifying non-metered connections and scheduling \ntheir  meter  connections,  (iv)  improving  water  management  through  better  monitoring  by \ninstalling flow meters within the existing network and at all storage tanks, and (v) reducing \n                                                 \n11  The PSC is established and consists of the vice-president and minister of finance (chair) and representatives from \nMPIIC, the Office of the President, the Office of the Vice-President, the Palau Public Utility Corporation, a member \nof the House of Delegates, and a member of the Senate. \n12  ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n ", "5 \nsystem  losses  through  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  a  leak  detection  and  repair \nprogram.  Some  of  these  measures  will  take  until  FY2015  to  complete.  Meeting  these \nbenchmarks will help achieve reliable and affordable services.  \n  3.  Full Cost Recovery is Achieved in the Water and Sewerage Sector \n21.  The MTDS outlines the government\u2019s policy of requiring people to pay tariffs that allow \nservices and utilities to operate on a full cost-recovery basis. This will allow the government to \nremove  subsidies  and  enable  the  sector  to  self-invest  in  maintenance  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment.  Transition  to  full  cost  recovery  will  take  4 years.  The  program  supports  (i) \nprogressive tariff increases up to the point of full cost recovery; and (ii) budget support to cover \nthe difference between tariff revenue and actual costs during this transition. The first and \nsecond tariff increases will be regulated by the Minister of Finance in (i) late 2010, to become \neffective in February 2011; and (ii) in late 2011, to become effective in February 2012. The third \nand fourth tariff increases being recommended to achieve full cost recovery for PWSC will be \nenacted by the PWSC board in subsequent years.  \n22.  To achieve full cost recovery in 4 years, tariffs for consumption of up to 5,000 gallons of \nwater per month will need to increase from $0.85 to $1.30 per 1,000 gallons consumed (a 53% \nincrease). Sewerage tariffs will also need to be charged, and will start at $0.30/1,000 gallons. \nTariffs  for  high  residential  water  users  (over  5,000  gallons)  and  non-residential  users  will \nincrease more steeply to $3.36/1,000 gallons. These rates will encourage prudent consumption \nand facilitate maintaining a sustainable supply of treated water. Commercial sewerage tariffs will \nbe introduced at $1.70/1,000 gallons and increase steadily over the 4 years. \n23.  During the transition to full cost recovery, PWSC will operate at a loss. The government, \nthrough the program, has committed to fund the shortfall through annual budget appropriations \ntotaling $5.1 million. This budget support will include $2.5 million in FY2011, $1.5 million in \nFY2012, with the remaining $1.1 million depending on the tariffs set by the PWSC board in late \n2012 and 2013. The government will enter into a financial agreement with the PWSC to (i) \nassist in implementing the sector reforms, (ii) make possible the improvements in technical and \nmanagerial capacity and operational efficiency, and (iii) promote water conservation and health \nawareness. The government will provide financial assistance in the form of a loan of up to \n$6 million to the PWSC to achieve these objectives. Through the financial agreement, the \ngovernment will also provide grant transition financing of up to $2.6 million.13 The grant will \ncover the difference between revenue collected by the PWSC and the full cost of operations. \n24.  At the end of the transition to full cost recovery in October 2015, the government will no \nlonger provide financial support to the sector. The PWSC will have the ability to charge tariffs to \nmaintain infrastructure and make new investments. The government will have improved its fiscal \nposition by at least $2.2 million (1.1% of GDP) per year as recommended by the International \nMonetary Fund (footnote 5). \n4.  Effective Public Consultation is in Place \n25.  ADB lessons from implementing reform across the Pacific stress the importance of \npublic consultation before and during the reforms. Broad public support is important to achieving \nreform in the water and sanitation sector. Under the program, the government has undertaken a \npublic  advocacy  program  with  politicians,  civil  society,  and  community  groups  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s policy, its importance to Palau\u2019s future, and the impact on the people. In doing so, \n                                                 \n13 The value of the grant will be determined by the date on which the PWSC is declared operationally effective. Until \nthis time, budget support will be channeled through the MPIIC.  \n ", "6 \nthey have sought support for the creation of PWSC and for tariff reform, thereby reducing the \nrisk that support will wane over time. The PWSC will conduct an awareness campaign on the \nimportance of water conservation and behavior change to help the community adapt to the new \npolicy arrangements and minimize their impact. The awareness campaign will include support \nfor sanitation, hygiene, water use, and health awareness. \n26.  Impacts  of  government  reform.  The  impact  on  the  water  sector\u2019s  financial \nsustainability and operational performance will fundamentally improve under the reforms being \nintroduced by the government. The PWSC will return a profit by FY2015 and the government\u2019s \nfiscal position will be improved by at least $2.2 million per year (Table 1). The creation and \nstrengthening of the PWSC will enable significant efficiency improvements and set the sector on \na path to long-term sustainable management of the resources to facilitate growth and address \nthe impacts of climate change in Palau. \n \nTable 1: Water and Sanitation Sector Financial Impact \n \nItem  FY2010 FY2011 FY2012 FY2013  FY2014  FY2015\nAverage water tariff ($)  0.85  0.96   1.37   1.82   2.36   2.62 \nAverage sewerage tariff ($)  0.00  0.69   0.81   1.02   1.30   1.44 \nSystem losses (%)  43  43  40  30  35  25 \nSector financial projections           \nTotal revenue ($ million)  0.52  0.76   1.72   2.25   2.90   3.21 \nTotal expenses ($ million)  2.60  2.99  3.13  3.30  3.29  3.17 \nNet profit/loss ($ million)  (2.08) (2.23) (1.41)  (1.05)  (0.40)  0.03 \n          \nGovernment subsidy ($ million)  2.08  2.23   1.41   1.05   0.40   0.00 \n( ) = negative, FY = 1 October to 30 September. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nD.  Program Costs and Financing \n27.  The government has requested (i) a loan of $12.6 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources (OCR), and (ii) a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR2.23 million ($3.4 \nmillion equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund [ADF] loan) \nto help finance its reform program. The OCR loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  3  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. The government \nhas provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB. The ADF loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an \ninterest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The borrower will be the \nRepublic of Palau. Proceeds of the program loan are expected to be used within 24 months \nfrom the date of loan effectiveness. \n28.  The  size  of  the  Program  has  been  determined  after  due  consideration  of:  (i)  the \nprojected financing requirements for the sector over the implementation period at about $16 \nmillion; (ii) the lack of  available cofinancing resources; (iii) the direct costs of supporting tariff \nreform, Output 3, of approximately $5.1 million; (iv) adjustment costs in restructuring the sector, \nincluding  reticulation  network  refurbishment,  improving  sector  commercial  capacity,  and \ncapacity development programs through Outputs 1, 2, and 4 of approximately $6 million; and (v) \n ", "7 \nthe significance and sensitivity of the policy actions. The government will contribute $1.2 million \nthrough in-kind and cash contributions to implement the program. \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n29.  Program management. MOF will be the executing agency and will be responsible for \nthe overall implementation, financial management, and budget support required under the \nprogram. The implementing agency will initially be MPIIC, with PWSC serving as implementing \nagency once it becomes operationally effective (prior to the release of the second tranche). The \nimplementing agency will be responsible for implementation of outputs 2, 3, and 4 under the \ndirection of the PSC. A financing agreement between the government and the PWSC will \nmanage the rights and obligations of the PWSC to implement the program. MOF will establish \nthe PIU and provide ongoing support to the executing agency and implementing agencies. The \nPIU will be staffed with national staff supported by international consultants. The PSC will be \nresponsible for overall direction, guidance, and monitoring of the program. The government and \nPSC recognize the challenges and have engaged all the stakeholders early in the reform \nprocess. The government and members of the PSC were involved in establishing Palau\u2019s power \nutility and bring this experience and insight to the program. Implementation arrangements are in \nTable 2.  \n  Table 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  30 September 2010\u201329 September 2014 \nEstimated completion date  29 September 2014 \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body  Chair: vice-president and minister of finance \nMembers: Public Infrastructure, Industries and Commerce; Office of \nthe President; Office of the Vice President; Palau Public \nUtility Corporation. \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance. \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  (i) Ministry of Public Infrastructure, Industries and Commerce; and \n(ii) Palau Water and Sewer Corporation. \nDisbursement  First tranche release: $3.40 million ADF; $6.40 million OCR; and a \ntarget release date of January 2011. \n  Second tranche release: $6.20 million OCR; and a target release \ndate of April 2012. \nADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n30.  Development partner programs. Development partners\u2014Australia, the International \nMonetary Fund, Japan, Taipei,China, and the United States\u2014have expressed their support for \nthe program but have no activities scheduled for the sector.14  \n31.  Program  period  and  tranching. All disbursements and policy actions in the policy \nmatrix  will  be  implemented  on  delivery  of  the  second  tranche  conditions  by  April  2012. \nImplementation will finish after full cost recovery of the PWSC has been achieved by September \n2014. The PIU and PWSC will continue to implement the reforms after release of the second \ntranche. ADB will continue to undertake joint reviews until December 2014.  \n32.  Counterpart funds. The government will ensure counterpart funding will be used to \nfinance costs under the program, including, but not limited to (i) developing a legal and policy \n                                                 \n14  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nframework for the water sector, (ii) establishing a PWSC, (iii) providing transitional finance until \nPWSC becomes financially autonomous, and (iv) promoting water conservation.  \n33.  Procurement and disbursement. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed to the \ngovernment  as  the  borrower  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Simplified  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated Requirements for Program Loans.15 The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. The proceeds will finance the \nfull foreign exchange costs, excluding local taxes and duties, of items produced and procured in \nADB member countries and exclude items on the list of ineligible items and imports financed by \nother bilateral and multilateral sources.16 No supporting import documentation will be required if, \nduring each year that loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of Palau\u2019s total \nimports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and disbursements made \nunder other official development assistance is greater than the amount of the loan expected to \nbe disbursed during such year. The government will certify its compliance with this formula with \neach withdrawal request. Otherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be \nrequired. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of \nthe government's certification. \n34.  Accounting, auditing, and performance management. The government will maintain \nrecords of account for the program. Prior to withdrawal, the government will open a deposit \naccount  at  a  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  to  receive  the  loan  proceeds.  The  account  will  be \nmanaged, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. MOF, PSC, \nand ADB will monitor the progress of the program and measure performance.   \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.   Economic and Financial \n35.  The  government  has  made  progress  in  improving  public  financial  management, \nparticularly in government financial accounting and reporting. The public finance legislative \nframework  is  robust  and  financial  management  systems  are  good.  Expenditure  has  been \naligned with revenue in the current fiscal year. However, systems for budget preparation and \nmanagement still require improvement. Budget appropriations are not aligned with revenue, \nleading to persistent deficits. Cash management planning also inhibits the ability to plan and \nmanage expenditure. The Office of the Public Auditor and Office of the Special Prosecutor \nperform  their  mandate  effectively.17  Recognizing  these  financial  management  issues,  the \ngovernment sought ADB\u2019s assistance to strengthen budget preparation and management.18 \nLinked with this work, the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre is working with MOF to \nstrengthen cash management. \n36.  Palau\u2019s government debt is low at 9.6% of GDP. The impact of the program loan will be \nto increase government debt to 15.5% of GDP. Government debt servicing, currently 0.8% of \nGDP will also remain low. \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 1998.

Technical Assistance to the Republic of Palau for Implementing a Medium-Term Budget Framework. \nManila (TA 7421-PAL). \n ", "9 \nB.  Governance \n37.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MOF.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the program. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan documents.19  \n38.  MPIIC has the technical skills to maintain the water and sanitation systems, but lacks \nspecialist  managers,  planners,  and  engineers  needed  to  create  a  separate  entity  outside \ngovernment. Despite strong champions for this reform, there is also a limited cadre of people \ncapable of managing the organizational change required by the program. The government \nrecognizes the need for technical support and managers of organizational change. They will use \nloan funds for this purpose.  \n39.  The National Government Procurement Law is applied to all expenditure of government \nfunds.  It  emphasizes  the  government's  policy  of  promoting  fair  and  competitive  public \nprocurement and prescribes most of the important procurement matters to be followed. The law \nis enforced strictly. Competition and efficiency is maintained in MPIIC\u2019s procurement. \nC.  Poverty and Social \n40.  The PWSC\u2019s transition to full cost recovery in 4 years is designed to minimize the impact \non the poor. The new tariff structure will better target the needs of the poor. The first 5,000 \ngallons  (double  the  World  Health  Organization\u2019s  recommendations)  is  below  the  cost  of \nproduction to ensure affordability to the poor. The average total household water and sewerage \nbill will increase from 1% to 1.9% of average household income progressively over the 4 years. \nThe  program  includes  the  promotion  of  water  conservation  and  health  awareness  at  the \nhousehold level. The reliability of water supply during drought will improve, benefiting the poor. \nThe program will improve the climate resilience of Palau\u2019s water resources. Over time, the \nprogram will yield broadly distributed social benefits by providing a foundation for improving the \nfiscal position of Palau. This will enhance the sustainable delivery of essential services.20 \nD.  Safeguards  \n41.  The  program  has  been  classified  under  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples.  Improved  national  water  resource  planning,  water \nconservation, and strengthening of environmental quality control regulations relating to water \nabstraction and sewerage outflow are expected to yield positive environmental outcomes and \nameliorate the negative impacts of climate change in the future. \nE.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n42.  Risk  will  be  monitored  and  managed  by  the  PIU  during  program  implementation. \nChanges in risk assessment and risk mitigation will be monitored by the government and ADB \nthrough its scheduled reviews. Major risks and mitigating measures are in Table 3.21 \n                                                 \n19  Loan Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPolitical commitment to annual tariff  A public awareness campaign will be conducted, including on \nincreases for water and sewer services  financial sustainability.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n43.  The government and MOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail \nin the program implementation arrangements and loan documents. \n44.  The loan will become effective after: (i) all conditions for the release of the first tranche of \nthe program, as specified in the policy matrix and set out in Attachment 2 to Schedule 3 to the \nloan agreement, have been complied with to the satisfaction of ADB; and (ii) the government \nhas established the PSC and the PIU for the program.  \nV.   RECOMMENDATION \n45.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n(i)  the  loan  of  $12,600,000  to  the  Republic  of  Palau  for  the  Water  Sector \nImprovement Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; and  \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR2,230,000 to the Republic of \nPalau for the Water Sector Improvement Program from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft program loan agreement presented to \nthe Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n15 October 2010 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms   Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nSustainable water  Government transfers to the water  Annual budget  The government \nand sewerage  sector are eliminated by 2015  submissions and  and community \nservices  (2010 baseline: $2.4 million per  PWSC annual reports  continue to support \nannum).    water sector reform. \n     \nPWSC annual revenue exceeds  PWSC annual report  Risk \ncosts by 2014 (2010 baseline: $2.4    Political \nmillion loss)  interference in \nwater and \nsanitation sector \nmanagement. \n \nOutcome  Nonrevenue water is less than  PWSC production and  Assumptions \nDemand for water  25% by FY2015 (2010 baseline:  management reports  Airai accepts \nand sewerage  43%)    metered water \nservices is met.      supply services. \nProjected demand for water in  PWSC production and   \nFY2015 of 3.0 million gallons per  management reports  Palauans accept \nday is within supply capacity (2010    user pays principle \nbaseline: demand is 3.8 million    for service delivery. \ngallons per day)     \n    The government \nThe continuity of water supply to  PWSC production and  maintains subsidies \nusers increases to 99.9%+ by  sales data in annual  to the sector until \n2014 (2010 baseline: 95%)  reports  2015.  \n     \nHouseholds reduce water  PWSC production and    \nconsumption by 30% by FY2015  sales data in annual \n(2009 baseline: 169  reports \ngallons/capita/day)   \n   \nThe number of uncontrolled  PWSC production and \nsewage overflows is reduced by  sales data in annual \nmore than 20% by FY2015 (2010  reports \nbaseline: 20 uncontrolled overflow \nevents) \n \nOutputs      Risks \n1.
