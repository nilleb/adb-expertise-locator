INTRODUCTION\n1. The Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam asked the Asian Development\nBank  (ADB)  to  provide  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  improve  planning  and\nimplementation capabilities for relevant government planning and service delivery agencies in\nthe central region. The goal is to promote improved socioeconomic outcomes for the rural poor.\nFrom 21 February to 14 March 2001 the ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam and held\ndiscussions with government officials and other stakeholders in Hanoi and three central region\nprovinces: Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien Hue. The TA is included in the 2001 TA\nProgram  for  Viet  Nam.1  This  TA  will  support  the  proposed  Central  Region  Livelihood\nImprovement Project for 10 upland districts within Kon Tum, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, and Thua\nThien Hue provinces.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The ADB 2001-2005 country strategy for Viet Nam includes a geographic focus on the\ncentral region. The Government confirmed support for this approach. The geographic focus will\nbe carried out through community-based livelihood projects to address at the micro-level the\ncauses  of  poverty  in  a  small  number  of  provinces  in  the  north-central  coast  and  central\nhighlands. Although Viet Nam\u2019s performance in reducing poverty was good during the 1990s\nthrough a policy of pro-poor economic growth, certain groups have not shared in this general\nimprovement in living standards. These include the rural poor, especially ethnic minorities, in\nupland areas of the central region, where poverty rates are significantly higher than the average\nfor the country as a whole. Surveyed communes have poverty rates of up to 75 percent,2\ncompared with the national average of 37 percent. Rural upland communities have low levels of\neducation attainment, limited opportunities for rural nonfarm employment, poor health status,\nand limited access to services and basic infrastructure. One key reason is that institutions are\nrelatively weak in upland areas of Viet Nam. This is evidenced by poor service delivery, which\nresults from (i) lack of accountability for institutions and lack of reward for good work, or\nsanctions  for  low-quality  work;  (ii)  relatively  low-skilled  planners  and  service  providers,\nespecially those for people in poor and remote regions; and (iii) lack of adequate funds available\nfor poverty reduction activities. In those areas, service delivery outcomes, quality of governance,\nand institutional quality are all below average for the country; they are among the reasons the\nGovernment selected the upland areas for this TA.\n3. Within this environment of relative poverty, improved governance can create conditions\nfor significantly better service delivery. To promote improved poverty-focused service delivery in\nthe  targeted  areas,  three  issues  must  be  addressed:  (i)  making  rules,  regulations,  and\nbudgeting constraints governing service delivery, clearer and more transparent; (ii) increasing\ncompetition  in  selected  sectors,  such  as  microfinance  services,  agricultural  extension,  and\ninfrastructure  construction;  and  (iii)  holding  service  providers  accountable  to  local  citizens\nthrough closer interaction and feedback between government and clients. The Government has\nattempted to promote improved governance and higher quality service delivery by decentralizing\nselected  poverty-focused  programs  such  as  Program  135,3  and  by  promoting  greater\naccountability  through  legislation,  such  as  the  Decree  on  Regulation  and  Exercise  of\nDemocracy in Communes (Grassroots Democracy Decree),4 which empowers citizens to meet\nand discuss with local leaders issues regarding local spending and policy priorities. Under\nProgram 135, district and commune people\u2019s committees have the authority to select local\n                  \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 5 September 2000.\n2  TA 3392-VIE: Central Region Poverty Reduction Project, Final Report, January 2001.\n3  The 1,715 Poorest Communes Program, Prime Minister\u2019s Decision 135, 31 July 1998.\n4  Decree 29/CP on The Regulation and Exercise of Democracy in Communes, 1998.", "2\npriorities and spend program funds accordingly. Local communities are empowered to play an\nactive role in project selection within their communities. The Grassroots Democracy Decree\naims to provide a supportive institutional environment to promote programs like Program 135,\nwhich  has  to  a  limited  extent  demonstrated  the  central  Government\u2019s  ability  to  implement\nvertical service delivery programs, and deliver at least some improved services to rural clients.\nHowever, to date, Program 135 has evinced problems such as (i) weak horizontal coordination\nand relatively low skill levels among local service providers; (ii) insufficient funds to achieve\nmandated poverty reduction objectives; and (iii) relatively weak feedback between clients and\nservice providers, especially in remote or disadvantaged regions.\n4. Services in the targeted provinces are provided through (i) line ministries, such as the\nDepartment of Agriculture and Rural Development, which has provincial and district offices; (ii)\nmass  organizations  like  the  Viet  Nam  Women\u2019s  Union,  which  has  provincial,  district,  and\ncommune representatives; and (iii) special central Government-mandated poverty reduction\nprograms, such as Program 135, aimed at poor communes within the country. These efforts\nhave met with only limited success in upland areas, as evidenced by the relatively slow drop in\npoverty rates during the past decade. While the Government\u2019s vertical service delivery modality\nhas been relatively effective at addressing specific national problems, such as the attainment of\nuniversal primary education or the eradication of Vitamin A deficiency, service delivery in the\ntarget districts has been beset by many of the same constraints to high-quality service delivery\nin many other parts of the country. Local research indicates that district-level coordination of\nimplementing bodies is weak, and that commune people\u2019s committees have been unable to\nsustainably  garner  feedback  from  citizens.  Thus,  while  formal  efforts  have  been  made  to\npromote decentralized service delivery, most civil servants continue to act and work according\nto norms established when delivery modalities were highly centralized.\n5. An important condition for improved service delivery is that service providers have the\nnecessary skills, including organizational, technical, and communication; and the opportunity to\nuse them to successfully fulfill their assigned missions. In upland areas of Viet Nam, these\ninstitutional  conditions  for  better  quality  service  provision  are  largely  absent.  In  particular,\nservice providers and local clients often have serious communication difficulties, resulting from\nboth  linguistic  and  cultural  differences,  so  local  service  providers  require  special  skills  to\ncommunicate effectively with their clients. Local service delivery staff have the potential to\nimprove their performance if they are given the opportunity to work in an enabling institutional\nand organizational environment that recognizes and rewards people primarily on the basis of\nability, and according to transparent rules. Capacity building, within a transparent environment,\ncan lead to improved performance.\n6. Finally, because of their relative poverty, the target provinces also lack adequate local\nresources to purchase basic inputs or hire additional staff, resulting in limited flexibility for\nbudgeting and staff deployment. Each province receives approximately half of its total revenue\nin the form of central Government transfers, and in upland districts revenues collected appear to\naccount for only 10-20 percent of total spending in most cases. Reported spending patterns\nindicate that most district budgets are spent on recurrent items (primarily salaries) with only 10-\n20  percent  of  the  budget  left  for  capital  spending.  Therefore,  limited  flexibility  regarding\ndepartment staffing and spending priorities (because much of the central money transferred to\nlocalities is channeled through line ministries) combined with low absolute budgets implies that\nupland districts have relatively few methods at their disposal to sustainably improve services\nand reduce poverty. Evidence from the recently completed Government-Donor Working Group\nPublic Expenditure Review (PER) indicate that poor districts have limited negotiating power with\nthe central Government regarding budgetary transfers, while wealthy provinces have the power\nto negotiate more favorable funding norms.", "3\n7. The TA will address poverty by improving service delivery both directly in a number of\npilot communes, and by improving the institutional environment in the four provinces. The pilot\napproach will facilitate greater experimentation and innovative institutional approaches. The TA\nwill promote better project implementation by improving skills of service providers, and better\nutilization  of  loan  funding  provided  to  government  agencies  charged  with  direct  service\nprovision. It will indirectly support improved implementation through better understanding of\nlocal institutional and organizational environments, and local government officials will use this\nunderstanding to promote key policy and practice changes at national and subnational levels.\nThe  combination  of  these  factors  will  improve  implementation  conditions  for  the  proposed\nCentral Region Livelihood Improvement Project and future ADB and other external assistance-\nsupported poverty reduction projects in the poorer regions of Viet Nam.\n8. The TA also will attempt to promote improved implementation arrangements, and by\nfocusing on policy and practice changes, help create an improved institutional environment for\nongoing and future poverty-targeted interventions, especially those in the central region and\nthose focused upon improving planning and decentralization.5 Creation of coherent policy and\npractice principles will promote fundamental changes in government rules and supervision\narrangements; and will seek to improve conditions for future loan appraisal, development, and\ndisbursement.  Increased  competition  between  and  among  government  and  other  service\nproviders will offer ADB and other assistance agencies increased choices and flexibility in loan\ndesign;  improved  accountability  to  local  citizens  by  service  providers  will  promote  a  more\nresponsive and flexible civil service. Lastly, the TA will assist the Government to maintain the\nmomentum of its own efforts at promoting decentralized, accountable services, and will be\nlinked with other assistance and government efforts to promote sustainable approaches to\npoverty reduction in Viet Nam.6\nIII.  THE  PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n9. The goal of the TA is to facilitate creation of the conditions for improved decentralized\npoverty reduction initiatives in Viet Nam. The objectives are to (i) improve local service delivery\nperformance in selected pilot areas, and (ii) develop a set of key policy and practice changes\naimed at enhancing poverty-focused service delivery modalities. The main indicators of success\nwill be adoption by the Government of an agreed set of key policy and practice changes, and\nthe creation of a management structure able to deliver these changes. The TA framework is\nincluded as Appendix 1.\nB.  Scope\n10. The TA has two main components: (i) design, testing, and implementation of improved\ndecentralized service delivery arrangements and outcomes in eight pilot communes with a\nresulting model for wider replication; and (ii) development of an active policy and practice\nnetwork, leading to the development of key principles that will serve as the basis for the\nGovernment to improve decentralized service delivery for poverty reduction in Viet Nam.\n                  \n5   Two related ADB TAs are (i) TA 3591-VIE: Strengthening the Planning Capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture and\nRural Development,  for  $300,000,  approved  on  15  December  2000;  and  (ii)  TA  3289-VIE: Support for\nDecentralization and Participation in Planning, for $1,000,000, approved on 8 November 1999.\n6  Related projects include the World Bank\u2019s Northern Mountains Poverty Reduction Project and its Community\nBased Rural Infrastructure Project. In addition, the Government plans to undertake a series of public administration\nreform efforts, with support provided by a number of multilateral and bilateral financing agencies.", "4\n11. Because this TA is a learning exercise, implementation will be limited to a small number\nof  communes,  thus  providing  enhanced  opportunities  for  monitoring,  learning,  program\nredesign,  and  subsequent  expansion.  The  TA  will  work  directly  in  eight  communes  (two\ncommunes per province)7 to provide a representative geographical and socioeconomic sample\nof communes in the TA area, with counterparts to improve quality and access to (i) planning and\nadministration, (ii) microfinance, (iii) agricultural extension, (iv) infrastructure development, and\n(v) land use planning. Services will be improved by undertaking diagnostics of existing service\ndelivery modalities, designing three rounds of pilot service-delivery implementation models, and\nundertaking  an  evaluation  of  each  modality.  Projects  will  be  implemented  by  district  and\ncommune  staff,  and  will  be  directly  linked  to  current  district/commune  planning  and\nimplementation systems. The TA will develop improved planning modalities to ensure that they\nare sensitive to gender, indigenous peoples, and environmental concerns. Skill deficiencies will\nbe addressed through intensive capacity building efforts, including designing improved training\ncurricula, training a cadre of local government staff, training trainers, and strengthening local\ntraining institutions. These activities are directly linked with promoting improved decentralized\nservice delivery and effective governance in disadvantaged areas of Viet Nam.\n12. A PER will be undertaken in selected districts and communes so that TA consultants\nand government staff can understand current spending patterns and processes more clearly in\npractice. The local PER will (i) complement and draw on findings from the recently completed\nnational PER, clarifying how national spending priorities are translated into concrete spending\npatterns at local levels; (ii) assist the Government to develop methods to implement policy\nrecommendations  emanating  from  the  national  PER;  and  (iii)  recommend  approaches  to\nincrease local revenue-generating capacity.\n13. Findings from pilot implementation modalities will be synthesized and combined with\ninputs  from  members  of  a  central  region  learning  network  (a  cooperative  effort  of  local\ngovernment, assistance agencies, and nonstate groups, such as research institutions), to be\nestablished during the TA.8 The learning network will form the basis for creating key policy and\npractice change principles aimed at promoting effective, poverty-focused service delivery. By\nthe end of the third year, the learning network members will prepare a report that includes (i)\ndescription of the current service delivery situation and recommendations for a more flexible\nstaffing, planning, and budget-setting process targeted at needs of rural poor households in the\nTA area; (ii) systematic analysis of constraints and opportunities facing administrative organs\nand  service  delivery  agencies  in  planning,  budgeting,  and  implementing  service  provision,\nbased upon case studies and empirical evidence; review of the institutional environment facing\nlocal  citizens,  including  a  focus  on  tax  burdens,  user  fees,  and  labor  obligations;  (iii)\nrecommendations for policies and practices that will promote improved quality and access of\nservice delivery; and report on best practice lessons containing analysis of and justification for\nkey policy and practice principles drawn from pilot experiences and other relevant poverty-\nfocused projects.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n14. ADB and the Government of the United Kingdom will cofinance the TA on a joint basis.\nThe total cost of the TA is approximately $3.7 million equivalent consisting of $1.5 million in\nforeign  exchange  cost,  and  $2.2  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  and  the\nGovernment of the United Kingdom will finance all foreign exchange costs and approximately\n                  \n7  The eight communes will be selected from among the 10 districts identified for support under the proposed Central\nRegion Livelihood Improvement Project.\n8  To be established at a regional institution, such as the Center for Rural Development of Hue University.", "5\n$1.6 million equivalent of the local currency costs, for a total of approximately $3.11 million.\nADB will provide $800,000 on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, financed by the\nGovernment of Japan. The Government of the United Kingdom will contribute the equivalent of\n$2.31 million through a joint cofinancing agreement with ADB. The Government of Viet Nam will\nfinance the balance of local currency costs, $622,000 equivalent, by providing counterpart staff,\noffice accommodation, workshop facilities, transportation, and by supporting training of local\ngovernment personnel, and cofunding of pilot initiatives. Detailed cost estimates and financing\nare shown in Appendix 2.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n15. The Executing Agency will be the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), which will\nclosely coordinate TA implementation with the four provincial people\u2019s committees in the TA\narea. A multiministerial committee, chaired by MPI, will comprise representatives from the\nMinistry  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development,  Ministry  of  Finance,  Committee  for  Ethnic\nMinorities and Mountainous Affairs, and other relevant ministries and agencies, and will review\nthe findings and recommendations from TA outputs, coordinate discussion of these at the\ncentral level, and provide periodic feedback on key policy and practice principles emanating\nfrom TA activities. The TA will begin in December 2001 and be completed by 31 December\n2004.\n16. The TA will finance a total of 54.5 person-months of international and 137 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants inputs. The outline terms of reference are found in Appendix 3.\nA consulting firm will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants.  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  will  be  followed  for  the  portion  of  the  TA  financed  by  the\nGovernment of the United Kingdom. The TA consultants will be based in Hanoi, report to the\nMPI TA director, and liaise with the relevant vice-chairman of the provincial people\u2019s committee\nin  charge  of  social  programs.  The  consultants  will  be  provided  with  office  space  in  each\nprovincial capital to enable them to work closely with provincial, district, and commune People\u2019s\nCommittees,  planning  bodies,  line  ministries  (i.e.,  Department  of  Agriculture  and  Rural\nDevelopment, Ministry of Transport, Department of Land Administration), and other agencies\ncharged with service delivery included in this TA.\n17. The TA will prepare, in English and Vietnamese, an inception report, quarterly progress\nreports, and a final report for submission to the Government (MPI, with copies to the vice-chair\nof  participating  provincial  people\u2019s  committees),  ADB,  and  the  Government  of  the  United\nKingdom. An inception workshop will be convened six weeks after TA commencement, and\nperiodic workshops held in the central region and Hanoi to report on progress and agree on\nimplementation  of  each  phase  of  the  TA  process.  A  wrap-up  workshop  will  be  convened\napproximately six weeks before the end of the TA to address achievement of TA objectives.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION\n18. The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of\ntechnical assistance to the Government of the Socialist Republic Viet Nam for the purpose of\nCapacity Building for Central Region Poverty Reduction, to be financed by the Government of\nthe United Kingdom on a grant basis in an amount of $2,308,000. If the Board approves ADB\nadministering the portion of the technical assistance to be financed by the Government of the\nUnited Kingdom, the President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, shall approve\nthe provision of the balance of the technical assistance to be financed by ADB on a grant basis\nin an amount equivalent to $800,000.", "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Indicators Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions/Risks\nGoal\nImproved conditions for decentralized -Service delivery performance in -Vietnam Living Standards Survey and -Central Government perceives need\npoverty reduction initiatives in Viet Nam upland areas improve at least as other Government surveys for change\nrapidly as in lowland areas -Government policy effectively\nimplemented at subnational levels\nPurposes\n1.
