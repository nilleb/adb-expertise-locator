During the Country Program Consultation Mission in December 2005, the Government \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to improve efficiency in road transport, energy conservation, and \nenvironmental protection. TA was included in ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update \n(2006\u20132008) and was confirmed by the Government during the Country Programming Midterm \nReview  Mission  in  March  2006.  An  ADB  Fact-Finding  Mission  (the  Mission)  reviewed  the \nrationale and justification of the proposed TA for Resource Optimization in the Road Sector with \nthe Ministry of Communications (MOC) as the Executing Agency (EA) and the Ministry of \nFinance.  The  Mission  discussed  with  MOC  the  need  to  optimize  the  use  of  land  in  road \ninfrastructure development and improve the efficiency of public and freight transport, energy \nefficiency, and environmental protection, and how the proposed TA could help. The Mission \nreached an understanding with the Government on the scope and output of TA, cost estimates, \na financing plan, consultants\u2019 terms of reference, and implementation arrangements.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Over the last 2 decades, road construction in the PRC has moved at a rapid pace, and \nthe development of the expressways and other road networks has contributed greatly to the \nPRC\u2019s economic development. By the end of 2005, the road network had grown to include \n41,000 kilometers (km) of expressways, 38,400 km of class I highways, 246,400 km of class II \nhighways, 344,700 km of class III highways, 921,300 km of class IV highways, and 338,800 km \nof rural and other roads, for a network total of 1.93 million km.  \n \n3.  Land Use Planning. The land utilized by the road network is estimated at over 23,000 \nsquare km. With the planned increase of the expressway network to 65,000 km and the overall \nroad network to 2.3 million km by the end of the 11th Five-Year Plan 2006\u20132010 (11FYP), the \nprojected area of land used for road infrastructure will increase significantly. Conversion of \nfarmland  for  infrastructure  development,  industrialization,  and  other  investment  has  been \nneeded to support the PRC\u2019s economic growth. Cities offer discounted or free land to attract \ndevelopers or investors to garner the financial gains of development. However, this mechanism \nhas distorted land use and brought excessive conversion of farmland, creating a shortage of \ngood farmland. Today, the PRC\u2019s farmland per capita is one third of the world average. The \nMinistry of Communications thus faces a challenge in achieving the objectives of the 11FYP \nwith limited land resources. \n \n4.  Public and Freight Transport. Rapid economic growth in the PRC has changed the \nstructure of urban areas, which contribute 80% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Urban \nareas have been changed not only by economic development but also by migration from rural \nareas. In a single generation, 300\u2013400 million people have shifted from the countryside to the \ncity. The urban share of the total population grew from 26% in 1990 to almost 40% in 2005. This \nshift brought suburban development to many cities, making biking and walking less feasible and \nrapidly increasing the number of people who need public transport. In response to this need, the \ndevelopment of efficient and affordable public transport is an urgent priority. Rapid economic \ngrowth also brings increased freight traffic. Logistical costs have been cited as making up about \n30\u201340% of overall product costs in the PRC, much more than the 5\u201320% in the United States. \nFreight transport in the PRC heavily relies on expressways, but expanding the expressway \nnetwork is not the only way to increase the efficiency and reliability of freight transport. It is clear \nthat efficient and reliable freight transport is required for sustainable development. \n \n ", "2     \n5.  Energy Use. In parallel with economic growth, the number of vehicles on roads in the \nPRC has grown rapidly. The number of registered vehicles increased from about 1 million in the \nearly 1990s to 32 million in 2004. As a result, fuel consumption was 10 million tons in 2005.  \nWith development, the PRC has become the world\u2019s second largest oil consumer, changing \nfrom being an exporter of crude oil to importing a third of its fuel. The number of registered \nvehicles is projected to reach 170 million by 2020 under a business-as-usual scenario, with fuel \nconsumption projected to soar to 100 million tons by that year. Long-term energy security is \nbecoming a real concern. \n \n6.  Vehicle Emissions. Soaring oil consumption is a matter of the concern not limited to \nenergy security but also to the environment. Burning 100 million tons of oil, as projected in 2020, \nwill generate 102 million tons of the greenhouse gas (GHG). The National Statistics Bureau \nestimated economic losses to pollution in 2004 at CNY511.8 billion ($63 billion), equivalent to \n3.05% of GDP, with 43% of the loss due to air pollution. The State Environmental Protection \nAdministration estimated that auto emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons accounted \nfor 79% of total emissions in urban areas nationwide in 2005. This environmental issue is \nrelatively new but increasingly urgent.  \n \n7.  The Government is keen to move toward a savings-oriented approach to development, \nparticularly in the transport sector. The Government is focusing on the three fields: (i) road \nplanning  and  land  use,  (ii)  road  transport  management,  and  (iii)  energy  efficiency  and \nenvironmental protection.  \n \n8.  With  regard  to  land  use,  land  resources  have  been  imprudently  used  for  road \ninfrastructure development. Because roads have been constructed very rapidly, efficiency of \nland use and other opportunities, e.g., preserving productive farmland, private development, and \ncoordination with social activities, were sacrificed for fast development. An additional 24,000 km \nof expressways will be developed by the end of the 11FYP in 2010, as part of a 400,000 km \nexpansion of the road network. New frameworks and measures for efficient land use need to be \nestablished for efficient conversion and use of land to ensure sustainable and well-balanced \ndevelopment. \n \n9.  Growing urban populations and urbanization resulting from national economic growth \nare raising demand for public transport and expanding the areas to be served. However, the \ncontinuing shift to private cars and rapidly worsening road congestion are causing the quality of \nservice and efficiency of public transport to deteriorate. In addition, less consideration of mass \ntransit systems has been paid in urban road networks. The structure of urban road networks \nand inflexible regulations for public transport make it difficult for public transport operators to \nefficiently  respond  to  increased  demand.  It  is  becoming  clearer  to  the  Government  that \nincreasing the capacity and efficiency of public transport would greatly benefit sustainable \ndevelopment. A new policy framework and measures are required to strengthen the public \ntransport sector because road expansion alone is not a panacea bringing efficient and reliable \ntransport. \n \n10.  Highway freight traffic is increasing at almost the same rate as GDP growth, or about \n10% per annum from 2003 to 2005. The total length of the expressway network increased from \nby 15% from 2003 to 2004 and by 20% from 2004 to 2005, during which time the total length of \nroads other than expressways increased by just 5% annually. Freight transport, especially inter-\nprovince  and  international  traffic,  relies  heavily  on  the  expressway  network,  but  total  road \ninvestment has lagged behind the growth of freight transport. As noted above, logistical costs \n(transport, warehousing, administration, and inventory) are thought to account for 30\u201340% of \n ", "    3\ntotal cost of manufactured goods in the PRC, much more than the 5\u201320% in the United States. \nThe share of land transport in the PRC is about 65% of the total cost of shipping a container \nfrom Chongqing to US West Coast. It is clear that expanding expressways is not the answer to \nensuring efficient and reliable freight transport and that a new policy framework and measures \nare required, as they are for public transport. \n \n11.  The price of oil was $20 per barrel in January 2002 but rose to $72 per barrel in August \n2006, an increase of 360% in 2.5 years. Vehicle ownership in the PRC was about 1 million in \nthe early 1990s but will reach 170 million by 2020. The number of vehicles is one indicator of oil \nconsumption, and oil consumption is a direct indicator of GHG emissions. Without an adequate \npolicy framework and necessary measures to promote energy efficiency and environmental \nconservation, it is clear that transport in the PRC threatens global energy security and harms \nthe environment, both locally and globally. Also worth noting is that, as the PRC is the world\u2019s \nsecond largest oil consumer, energy efficiency and environmental protection are concerns of \nboth  national  and  global  relevance.  Improving  fuel  efficiency  in  transport  benefits  other \ncountries\u2019 sustainable development. Road traffic volume (vehicle-kms) in Japan, for example, \nincreased by 7% from 1997 to 2003, but total CO  emissions fell by 3.3% in the same period \n2\n(emissions from road transport accounts for about 20% of total CO  emissions). Half of the CO  \n2 2\nreduction  came  from  improved  vehicle  quality  and  the  other  half  from  improved  road \ninfrastructure  and  traffic  management.  This  shows  the  potential  for  aligning  sustainable \ndevelopment  with  energy  and  environmental  issues  and  the  importance  of  systematic \ncoordination between road administration and vehicle administration. \n \n12.  Under the 11FYP, the Government envisages significantly more efficient utilization of \nresources in all fields including the transport sector. The resource optimization targets of the \n11FYP in the transport sector are a (i) 20% reduction in land utilization per 100 million vehicle-\nkms; (ii) 25% reduction in port berth occupancy per 10,000 tons throughput; (iii) 20% reduction \nin  energy  consumption  per  ton-km  of  vehicles  and  ships;  and  (iv)  20%  reduction  in  total \nemissions of major pollutants. To meet the 11FYP targets, effective policy and measures are \nneeded to ensure sustainable, harmonious, and environmentally friendly development in the \ntransport sector, which will continue to contribute to rapid economic development in the country. \nA holistic approach is needed, and the aspects the policy and measures should cover are \ntechnology, regulations, economics, and building public awareness.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact of TA is expected to be resource optimization on PRC roads. The outcome \nof TA will be a policy framework, measures, and guidelines for road planning and land use, road \ntransport management, and improving energy efficiency and environmental protection. This will \nbe  achieved  by  (i)  undertaking  a  detailed  assessment  of  the  current  state  of  resource \noptimization in the road sector, in particular focusing on road planning and land use, road \ntransport management, and energy efficiency and environmental protection; (ii) identifying key \nissues relating to resource optimization in line with Government priorities in the 11FYP; (iii) \nlearning from experience in developed countries where resource optimization is successfully \nimplemented;  (iv)  preparing  recommendations  on  the  policy  framework  and  measures;  (v) \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping guidelines to assist local governments in implementing the policy framework and \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nmeasures;  (vi)  carrying  out  a  case  study  to  analyze  an  approach  to  implementing  the \nrecommendations and putting into effect recommendations; (vii) undertaking workshops for \nconsultation  with  stakeholders  and  to  disseminate  findings;  and  (viii) disseminating  a  final \n ", "4     \nreport. The design and monitoring framework outlining the expected impact, outcomes, outputs, \nand activities is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  International experts and national consultants will be engaged to help the Government \nstudy resource optimization in the road sector for road planning and land use, road transport \nmanagement, and energy efficiency and environmental protection. They will also prepare the \npolicy framework and measures and develop the guidelines. TA will be undertaken in close \nconsultation with provincial governments and the central Government agencies concerned and \nwill take into account all previous studies carried out by the Government, ADB, and other \nmultilateral agencies, as well as best international practice. TA will involve fieldwork, gathering \ninternational  experience,  analytical  research,  stakeholder  consultations  with  national  and \nprovincial governments, agencies responsible for road transport and road users, and training for \nbuilding the capacity of government staff to implement TA outputs.  \n \n15.  TA will include case studies from selected provinces that exemplify typical issues in the \nPRC with regard to the three fields of road planning and land use, road transport management, \nand energy efficiency and environmental protection and are willing to solve the issues. The \nselected provinces should be cooperative and have sufficient information and data for their \nparticular case study. The case studies will entail in-depth study on the current state and key \nissues in the three fields. The case studies will also apply the recommended policy framework, \nmeasures and guidelines.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of TA is estimated at $500,000. TA will be financed as a grant from ADB\u2019s \nTA funding program. The Government requested ADB to finance $400,000. MOC will finance \nthe remaining $100,000, which will cover office accommodation and counterpart staff required to \nimplement TA. The detailed cost estimate is in Appendix 2.    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  TA, including fieldwork, will require about 36 person-months of consulting services (6 \ninternational and 30 national) spread over 9 months. Individual international consultants and a \nnational consulting firm will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2006) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of national \nconsultants. The national consulting firm will be engaged following the quality-based selection \nmethod,  using  a  simplified  technical  proposal.  The  international  consultants  will  provide \nexpertise in (i) road planning and land use, (ii) road transport management, and (iii) energy \nefficiency and environmental protection. The national consultants will have expertise in (i) road \ndesign and planning; (ii) planning and regulations on land use; (iii) road transport management; \n(iv) freight and public transport; (v) energy conservation in road transport, including vehicle \nstandards; (vi) environmental economy and policy analysis on road transport, including GHG \nand vehicle emission control; and (vii) managerial skills. The national consultant providing \nmanagerial skills will be the team leader, and three international consultants will be the sub-\nteam  leaders.  The  international  experts  will  supervise  and  provide  their  inputs  to  each \ncomponent.  A  national  consultant  firm  will  work  on  the  three  components  and  will  take \nresponsibility  for  coordinating  the  entire  study.  Appendix  3  presents  an  outline  terms  of \nreference for the consultants. \n \n ", "    5\n18.  MOC will be the EA and therefore responsible for guiding and supervising TA activities \nand for coordinating with relevant government agencies and organizations. MOC will (i) ensure \nthe  cooperation  of  the  government  agencies  concerned  and  (ii)  provide  guidance  and \nassistance to the consultants in implementing TA. To strengthen institutional capacity, TA will \nfinance a domestic and overseas training program in the areas of road planning and land use, \nroad  transport  management,  and  energy  efficiency  and  environmental  protection.  TA  is \nexpected to commence in May 2007 and be completed by January 2008. The international and \nnational  consultants  will  also  conduct  workshops  for  consultation  with  stakeholders and \ndissemination. MOC will provide to the consultants all relevant materials, recent studies, and \nreports required for TA. The consultants will maintain in close contact with MOC and ADB and \nwill keep them informed of TA progress and findings. Tripartite meetings of the Government, \nADB staff, and the consultants will be held to provide comments on a draft final report and guide \nthe consultants in finalizing it. Procurement of equipment provided under TA will be carried out \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006), and the equipment will be handed \nover to MOC upon completion of TA.  \n \n19.  The consultants will submit the following reports to ADB and MOC as scheduled in the \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 1): (i) a list of sources of information, a list of \nrelated regulations, a list of related organizations and contact persons, and an outline of case \nstudies; (ii) a list of identified issues and potential recommendations (the policy framework, \nmeasures, and guidelines); (iii) an inception report, including an outline of the final report, 4 \nweeks  following  commencement  of  the  services;  (iv)  an  interim  report;  (v)  draft \nrecommendations of the policy framework and measures; (vi) recommendations of the policy \nframework and measures; (vii) the draft final report; (viii) guidelines for local government; and \n(ix) the final report 2 weeks after receiving all comments from MOC and ADB. In addition, the \nconsultant will provide monthly progress reports to MOC and ADB. The consultants will hold a \nstakeholder consultation workshop within 8 weeks of commencing services and, within 4 weeks \nof submission of the draft final report, a national workshop in Beijing to disseminate TA findings. \nThe inception report, interim report, draft final report, and final report will be submitted in English \nand  Chinese  to  ADB,  MOC,  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission.  \n \nIV.
