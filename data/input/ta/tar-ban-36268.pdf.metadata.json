During the Country Program Confirmation Mission between 2 to 22 November 2003, the \nGovernment of Bangladesh (the Government) renewed its request that the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) provide assistance1 for enhancing private-sector participation in its gas sector to \nsupport sustainable development. ADB conducted a fact-finding mission from 7 to 15 July 2004.  \nA consultation mission2 (the Mission) visited Bangladesh from 4 to 10 November 2004 to finalize \nand reach an understanding with the Government on the objective, scope, cost estimates, \nfinancing, implementing arrangements, and the consultants\u2019 terms of reference of the proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA). The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Natural gas accounts for almost 70% of commercial energy and also provides the source \nfor about 90% of electricity generation in Bangladesh. Although Bangladesh has been producing \nnatural gas for more than three decades, its major fields are underdeveloped and have not been \nproperly delineated because  public resources cannot provide adequate support for essential \ninvestments.  Gas  sector  performance  has  fallen  short  of  its  potential  because  of  limited \nextraction and domestic use. The sector\u2019s operational performance has been affected by high \nsystem losses and, to some extent, by infrastructure constraints. Gas system losses were 6.3% \nof total production in FY2003, compared with 5.3% in the early 1990s. Bangladesh\u2019s natural gas \nis also under priced in relation to the long-term marginal cost. This leads to a high opportunity \ncost in terms of foregone resources that could have been mobilized to support investment within \nand outside the sector. As a result, constrained gas production causes supply shortages and \ndisrupts activities in power generation and industrial production. \n \n3.  Regulatory  Framework.  There  are  several  major  players  in  the  gas  sector  with \noverlapping and conflicting responsibilities.  The Energy and Mineral Resources Division of \nMinistry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources (MPEMR) has overall responsibility for the \ncountry\u2019s energy sector, with policy formulation, regulation, and investment decisions under its \ncontrol. Petrobangla, a statutory body, also plays a dominant role in policy formulation and \nenforcement  of  production-sharing  contracts  (PSCs)  with  international  oil  companies. \nPetrobangla  is  the  business  partner,  purchaser  of  gas,  and  enforcer  of  the  PSCs.  A \nhydrocarbon unit has been established at Petrobangla to assume regulatory functions for \nupstream activities, but its responsibilities remained limited to some technical issues. The \nEnergy Regulatory Commission (ERC) was created in 2003 to oversee the energy and power \nsectors, in accordance with ERC Act 2003, government policies, and other laws. Nevertheless, \nthe  government  plans  to  continue  regulating  upstream  activities  in  the  gas  sector  and \ntransferring regulation of downstream activities to ERC.  In order to encourage private-sector \nparticipation in the gas sector, a regulatory framework that provides comfort in terms of pricing \nand services provided is critical. This could be ensured through an independent regulatory \ncommission  with  appropriate  staff  and  explicit  power.  It  is  also  essential  to  separate  the \nGovernment\u2019s policy and regulatory functions, and to remove any policymaking tasks from \nstate-owned enterprises. \n \n                                                 \n1  The technical assistance (TA) was included in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) country strategy program of \nBangladesh for 2004\u20132007. The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 2 July 2004. \n2 The Mission comprised Neside Tas Anvaripour, Senior Energy Specialist (Finance), team leader, Energy Division, \nSouth Asia Department (SAEN); P. Abeygunawardena, Principal Project Economist, SAEN; and Shamsuddin \nAhmed, Head, Energy, ADB Bangladesh Resident Mission.   \n ", "2  \n \n4.  Unbundling of Gas Sector Entities. Gas sector reforms have been slow because of \nthe industry\u2019s structure and  size. Although Petrobangla  has been organized along functional \nlines, it is still a government agency in the form of a corporation. The National Energy Policy \n(NEP) envisions converting Petrobangla into a holding company under the Companies Act 1994 \nwith necessary organizational and financial restructuring.3 In order to improve management \nefficiency, the NEP envisages managing production, transmission, and distribution as separate \ncost and profit centers. Under ADB\u2019s Dhaka Clean Fuel Project, assets of transmission and \ndistribution companies were transferred to GTCL to create a national gas grid company. The \nGovernment plans but has yet to segregate TGTDCL\u2019s distribution business and Bakhrabat Gas \nTransmission and Distribution Company Limited into two independent companies. Some retail \nsupply could be transferred to the private sector, provided the necessary regulations and a \nstrategic timebound plan. \n \n5.  Corporate Governance. Corporate governance is another important policy issue. The \nGovernment has allowed full autonomy to gas subsector entities, but autonomy has yet to be \nfully exercised. Gas sector entities have been established as limited liability companies and are \ngoverned in principle by their boards of directors. In practice, however, the powers of the boards \nof directors are limited when it comes to making decisions on prices and investments. It is \nimportant for companies to interact with one another and with customers in a commercial \nmanner. Some directors sit on multiple boards, precluding real independence of one company \nfrom another. Board directors often lack knowledge of commercial operations. Reports on \noperations  at  Petrobangla  and  its  subsidiaries  are  not  published  annually.  Policies  and \nprocedures governing Petrobangla and its subsidiaries need to be reviewed and updated to \nreflect the recent developments in corporate governance. \n \n6.  Pricing Framework. The Government establishes domestic gas prices and determines \ntaxes for all gas sector companies as well as the distribution margins for gas transmission and \ndistribution companies. At present, taxes amount to 55% of tariffs. Following policy dialogue \nwith ADB and other development partners, the Government has taken steps to move away from \nadministered gas tariffs to a flexible and transparent mechanism under which gas prices would \nbe linked to the cost of supply for each category of consumer and adjusted periodically. In 2003, \nthe Government adopted an interim pricing framework that allows formula-based frequent tariff \nadjustments in line with international market prices. The Government was to implement initial \nprice adjustments based on these principles, resulting in an increase of about 6% in three \nphases (September 2003, March 2003, and September 2004). The adjustments expected in \nSeptember 2003 were only introduced in July 2004, however. The prices for transmission and \ndistribution do not reflect the size of the pipeline, volume of gas transported, length of pipelines, \nor return on investment. The transmission and distribution companies receive margins for the \nvolume of gas transmitted and sold to consumers that are hardly sufficient to cover operation \nand maintenance or debt servicing.  \n \n7.  Private-Sector Participation.  There is some private-sector involvement in the  gas \nsector through international oil companies, which operate in gas exploration/production, and \nthrough small companies that distribute liquefied petroleum gas and compressed natural gas. \nPublic-sector resources are insufficient for essential investments such as increasing exploration, \nexpanding transmission pipelines, and reactivating abandoned gas fields. The scale of the \nrequired investments in exploration means a significant potential role for the private sector \nprovided  the  right  incentives  and  business  environment.  In  gas  transmission,  operational \n                                                 \n3 Issues related to Petrobangla will be addressed under the TA 4332 (ADB. 2005. Gas Sector Development Project. \nManila).   \n ", "  3\nefficiency could be improved through various forms of private-sector participation. GTCL could \nenter into a long-term strategic partnership with an international gas transmission companies or \nconsider other  forms of private\u2013sector partnership such as build-own-maintain or build-own-\ntransfer. Future funds for investment could also come from a stock flotation or equity placement. \nSimilar options could be exercised in distribution and production companies. Private-sector \nprovision  of  gas  services  will  bring  modernization  opportunities,  as  well  as  customer \nresponsiveness, efficiency, and accountability. Substantial rehabilitation of existing facilities by \nprivate investors would also add value to poorly performing assets and expedite their potential \nfor privatization. \n \n8.  ADB has been involved in the gas sector in Bangladesh with eight loans totaling $446 \nmillion. The Third Natural Gas Development Project4 was completed in October 2003. Major \ninitiatives taken under the Third Natural Gas Development Project were (i) the establishment of \nthe  Hydrocarbon  Unit  in  the  MPEMR,  (ii)  adoption  of  a  gas  pricing  framework  linked  to \ninternational fuel oil prices, and (iii) regulatory framework that led to the creation of the Energy \nRegulatory  Commission.5  ADB  is  further  addressing  regulatory,  policy,  and  capacity \nstrengthening measures in the gas sector through the Dhaka Clean Fuel Project6 and the \nproposed Gas Sector Development Project.7     \n \n9.  The Government has been preparing a roadmap for gas sector reforms covering the \nnext 3 years and outlining its vision for matters including restructuring, ownership, private-sector \nparticipation, and regulation. Following the preparation of the roadmap, the Government  will \nbegin implementing gas sector reforms through a sequence of structural changes over the next \n2 to 3 years. Medium-term reforms proposed for the gas sector would include restructuring of \ngas-sector  entities,  ensuring  good  governance  through  providing  more  autonomy  to  the \ncompanies, further refinement of the gas price framework, operationalization of a new regulatory \nframework, and offloading shares in some companies. The gas sector, with its large potential in \ncontributing to economic development, would have to be effectively managed to maximize its \nrole  in  poverty  reduction.  The  Government  recognizes  that  it  should  focus  on  planning, \nstructuring, and regulation while the private sector should specialize in investment, construction, \nfinancing, and management. Private-sector participation is needed to meet gas sector\u2019s critical \nneed for rehabilitation and expansion. The proposed TA will help the Government improve the \nframework for private-sector participation and eventual privatization of gas sector activities to \nthe extent feasible and assuring sustainable development. The proposed TA will also implement \nselected gas sector reforms identified in the NEP and the Government\u2019s draft roadmap and \nbroaden  private-sector  participation  by  identifying  additional  opportunities  for  private-sector \ninvestments. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1993.

Purpose and Output \n10.  The TA will address issues constraining sector development through continuing policy \nreform, institutional restructuring and priority investments that would facilitate private sector \nparticipation. The TA will  help the Government in promoting private-sector participation and \nassuring sustainable development in the gas sector. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  A detailed examination of sector structure, unbundling of transmission and distribution \ncompanies, and investment planning will be undertaken to meet the reform objectives and to \nfacilitate  greater  private-sector participation for sustainable development of the gas sector. \nAdvice  on  policy  matters  and  stakeholder  communication  will  be  provided  throughout  TA \nimplementation.     \n \n12.  The key TA activities are grouped into five components: \n \n(i)  Component A: Assessing the adequacy of the existing policy and regulatory \nframework for private-sector participation in the gas sector. The assessment will \ninclude  recommendations  for  improvement  and  suggestions  for  better \nenforcement of the framework. \n \n(ii)  Component  B:  Examining  the  corporate  structure  of  gas-sector  entities  and \npreparing a corporate strengthening plan. Developing policies and procedures for \ngas  companies  that  reflect  recent  developments  in  corporate  governance \narrangements in more developed countries. \n \n(iii)  Component C: Analyzing gas transmission and distribution pricing framework to \nevaluate how these prices are reflecting the size of the pipeline, volume of gas \ntransported,  distance  or  length  of  pipelines,  and  return  on  investment. \nDeveloping recommendations for adequate pricing framework for these business \nsegments. \n \n(iv)  Component  D:  Examining  unbundling  options  for  gas  transmission  and \ndistribution entities, identifying major issues to be addressed, and defining steps \nto achieve this unbundling. \n \n(v)  Component  E: Designing  an  investment  package  covering  transmission  and \ndistribution business segments  of  gas  sector  that  would  facilitate  additional \nprivate-sector investment. \n \n13.  Petrobangla has identified several gas sector projects, and preparation of feasibility \nreports is underway. Component E will evaluate whether these feasibility reports are consistent \nwith a least-cost development plan for the gas sector and select suitable projects to develop an \ninvestment package to facilitate private-sector participation in the gas sector. \n \n    \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent, of which $370,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $255,000 equivalent the local currency cost. ADB will finance \n$500,000 on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, \nconsisting of the entire foreign exchange cost of $370,000 and $130,000 of the local currency \ncost. The Government will finance the remaining local currency cost of $125,000 equivalent. \nDetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Executing Agency will be MPEMR, which will provide overall supervision through its \nenergy  division.  MPEMR  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  components  A  to  D,  and \nPetrobangla will implement Component E. A TA steering committee will be  established and \nchaired  by  the  energy  secretary.  The  Implementing  Agencies  will  provide  (i)  office \naccommodation  and  facilities,  Internet  access,  and  secretarial  support;  and  (ii)  land \ntransportation within Dhaka for consultants. The Implementing Agencies will appoint directors \nfor  the  TA  management  offices.  Consultants  will  pay  for  international  communications \nconnected with TA implementation. MPEMR will buy office equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  The  Implementing  Agencies  will  guide  consultants  in  data \ngathering, preliminary analysis, and report writing, and will provide them with all necessary \nguidance in liaising with other government ministries and agencies. MPEMR, Petrobangla, and \nthe consultants will jointly organize dissemination workshops for counterpart staff and other \nstakeholders.  The  executing  and  Implementing  Agencies  will  coordinate  closely  with  the \nconsultants in ADB\u2019s ongoing project preparatory TAs in the gas sector. Consultants will be \naccountable to both ADB and MPEMR. \n \n16.  The TA will require about 10 person-months of international and 20 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services. Appendix 4 sets out terms of reference for consultants. The TA \nwill be implemented over 6 months from April 2005 to October 2005. ADB will engage a \nconsulting  firm  or  consortium  of  firms  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  or  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. Recruitment of consultants will be under the quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedures, and simplified technical proposals will be requested. The consultant team will be \nfielded when the steering committee is established and counterpart staff has been nominated. \n \n17.  The consultants will submit an inception report focusing on the work program no later \nthan two weeks after the commencement of their services. An interim report and a draft final \nreport will be submitted 10 and 16 weeks after inception, respectively. The consultants will \nprepare monthly status reports for their specific scope of work, highlighting any issues that could \nbecome critical to the timely completion of the TA. Tripartite meetings will be held in Dhaka to \ndiscuss the inception, interim, and draft final reports. Within 3 weeks after the tripartite meeting \nto discuss the draft final report, the consultants will submit a final report to the Government and \nADB incorporating all comments received from the Government and ADB.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bangladesh for Promoting Private Sector Participation in the Energy Sector, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6 Appendix 1     \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n  \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \nFacilitate sustainable  Increased economic  Increased energy supply   \ndevelopment through  growth in Bangladesh  and better corporate   \nprivate-sector  through provision of  governance.  \nparticipation in the gas  energy in a sustainable \nsector.  manner. \n \nPurpose       \nRemove or reduce  Policy, investment, and  Associated  Government\u2019s willingness to \nconstraints to gas sector  institutional  assessments, reports,  engage in dialogue and \ndevelopment through  strengthening package  review missions, and  commitment to implement \npolicy reform,  for the development of  policy dialogue.  necessary policy changes. \ninstitutional  the gas sector.   \nrestructuring, and priority \ninvestments to facilitate \nprivate-sector \nparticipation. \n \nOutputs       \nAn action plan for  An analysis of reasons,  Associated  Data is available and \nunbundling of  methods, and outcome  assessments, reports,  capable consultants are \ntransmission and  of transmission and  review missions, and  recruited.   \ndistribution entities.  distribution entities  policy dialogue.   \n   within 2 months of TA  The government and \n  commencement.  agencies are committed for \n    the development of the \nCorporate governance  Prepare a corporate  energy sector. \nprocedures for gas  governance procedure \nsector entities.  manual for the gas \n  sector entities within 2 \n  months of TA \n  commencement. \n   \nInstitutional/corporate  Develop a corporate \nstrengthening package  strengthening plan within \nfor gas sector entities.  3 months of TA \n  commencement. \n   \n   \nAn investment package  Prepare an investment \nthat will facilitate private  package within 5 months \nsector participation.  of TA commencement. \n   \n  Develop a policy and \nPolicy and regulatory  regulatory reform \nreform package.   package within 3 months \nof TA commencement. \n \n \nContinued on next page  \n ", "  Appendix 1    7\n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nActivities       \nA.
