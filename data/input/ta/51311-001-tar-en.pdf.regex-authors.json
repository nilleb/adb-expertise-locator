The Strengthening Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund Limited (BIFFL) Project will \nsupport infrastructure development in Bangladesh. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will \nprovide funds to infrastructure projects developed under the public\u2013private partnership (PPP) \nmodel through BIFFL, which is a public sector financing company mandated by the Government \nof Bangladesh to support the long-term financing of PPP projects. The project will facilitate long-\nterm infrastructure finance, support the rollout of a PPP strategy, and strengthen the overall \ncapacity of BIFFL in supporting PPP projects.   \n \n2.   The  project  will  be  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  investment  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment increased.1 It will have the following outcome: PPP infrastructure projects increased, \nand new employment opportunities created. The outputs are (i) long-term debt to infrastructure \nsubprojects provided and (ii) BIFFL\u2019s institutional capacity to finance PPP infrastructure projects \nimproved. The project will be financed with a $50 million loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n3.   Bangladesh\u2019s economic development during 2012\u20132019 has been strong; gross domestic \nproduct grew at an average rate of 7.0% per annum during that period.2 Bangladesh is on track \nto graduate from the United Nations\u2019 least-developed countries list in 2024.3 Rapid economic \ngrowth has increased the demand for energy, transportation, and urban development. However, \ninfrastructure deficit remains a bottleneck and prevents the economy from reaching its full \npotential. 4  Recognizing  this  issue,  the  government  has  recently  intensified  infrastructure \ninvestments; since FY2016, infrastructure investments have accounted for more than 30% of the \ngovernment budget. Nevertheless, public-sector-driven infrastructure development is constrained \nby the budget deficit, which was 5.5% in 2019, above the 5.0% ceiling level set by the government. \nFurthermore, the capacity of the public sector to implement more infrastructure development is \nalso significantly stretched, as evidenced by delays and cost overruns in many projects under \nconstruction. It has become clear that the infrastructure investment gap cannot be addressed by \nthe public sector alone, and more private sector resources must be directed to the development \nof infrastructure in Bangladesh.  \n \n4.  The government has identified PPP as an important tool to mobilize more private sector \nresources into infrastructure investments. In the government\u2019s 7th Five Year Plan, FY2016\u2013\nFY2020, PPP is expected to help bridge the infrastructure financing gap of 1.8% of gross domestic \nproduct on an annual basis. \n \n5. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the economy of Bangladesh. ADB \nestimates that the country\u2019s economic growth will weaken to 4.5% in FY2020 and 1.4 million\u20133.7 \nmillion workers may lose their jobs. 13 million people may fall back into poverty.

Dhaka. \n4  The World Economic Forum ranked Bangladesh 114th out of 141 countries in terms of infrastructure in its 2019 \nGlobal Competitiveness Report.  \n ", "2 \nthe pandemic, the government has also come under increasing fiscal pressures. In this context, \nPPP will take on added significance in complementing public financing to support infrastructure \ndevelopment, create jobs and spur economic growth.   \n \n6.   The government has mainstreamed PPP in the economic planning process and with the \nhelp of ADB has developed the legal and regulatory framework to support PPP. ADB, through the \nOffice of Public\u2013Private Partnership, has also supported project preparation with transaction \nadvisory services. To address long-term funding challenges of infrastructure projects, especially \nin PPP projects, the government set up BIFFL in 2011 to fund public sector infrastructure projects \n(promoted  by  line  ministries  or  local  governments),  such  as  public  roads  and  highways, \nparticularly those developed by the Bangladesh PPP Authority.5  \n \n7.  BIFFL is still a relatively new financial institution, with limited financial resources and \ninstitutional capacity. The attached transaction technical assistance (TA) will improve the capacity \nof BIFFL in screening, processing, funding, and implementing PPP infrastructure projects. During \nthe project period, it is expected that two PPP projects will be reviewed and approved by 2024, \nputting BIFFL on a sustainable path to achieve its mandate to support infrastructure development.   \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n8.  Output  1:  Bangladesh  Infrastructure  Finance  Fund  Limited  business  strategy \nreview and development. The TA consultants will review BIFFL\u2019s existing corporate business \ndevelopment strategy and improve its long-term sustainability to support BIFFL\u2019s mandated work \nin infrastructure and PPP development. This is in light of the rapid rise in the number of PPP \nprojects in Bangladesh in recent years, and the rising demand for long-term, local currency debt \nfunds from the market. The TA consultant will also help BIFFL identify operational gaps and refine \nthe corporate strategy as required. Furthermore, the consultant will review the overall governance \nstructure of BIFFL and provide assessment and recommendations for enhancement.  \n \n9.  Output  2:  Comprehensive  institutional  capacity  review  and  selected  capacity \ndevelopment. The TA consultants will conduct a comprehensive review of BIFFL\u2019s operational \nsystems, including funding and treasury operations, project finance and PPP, and credit and risk \nmanagement. Following the initial assessment, the TA scope could potentially be expanded to \nother  areas,  if  warranted,  including  accounting  and  internal  control;  corporate  information \ntechnology including credit risk rating models and project cycles (e.g., project identification, review, \napproval,  and  implementation  and  monitoring);  ADB  project  monitoring,  review,  and  audit; \ncorporate governance; and human resources. The TA consultants will identify critical operational \ngaps and propose a capacity development strategy to improve these identified priority areas. The \nareas of implementation work will be agreed upon by BIFFL and ADB based on the available \nbudget and other conditions. It is expected that at least 12 targeted training sessions (e.g., \nfocused on specific functional areas) will be provided to BIFFL staff during the TA implementation \nperiod.  \n \n10.  Output 3: A functioning environment and social safeguard unit established, and \ncapacity developed. The TA consultants will help establish a functioning environment and social \nsafeguard unit within BIFFL. Currently, this unit has one full-time staff member and a number of \nconsultants. The unit must be strengthened under the TA to sustain BIFFL\u2019s long-term lending \n \n5   However, because of the limited PPP pipeline, BIFFL has also been lending to non-PPP public and private sector \ninfrastructure and industrial projects, similar to those funded by the Infrastructure Development Company Limited. \nThe proposed project is designed to bring BIFFL back to its mandate of lending to support PPP development. \n  \n ", "3 \noperations to PPP projects. The subproject screening process will initially be limited to ADB-\nfunded subprojects, with training on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and the developed \nenvironmental and social management system, including subproject assessment, clearance, and \nthe monitoring and review process. Over the course of the project, it is expected that these \ninternational best practices will be gradually adopted by BIFFL to cover more projects and \neventually become the institutional policy.   \n \n11.  Output 4: Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund Limited\u2019s project administration \nand implementation capacities improved. The proposed ADB project and the attached TA are \nthe first such assistances to BIFFL. Therefore, ADB needs to ensure that BIFFL has the necessary \ncapacity to (i) identify and screen PPP pipeline subprojects, (ii) prepare and consolidate required \nsubproject  documents  (e.g.,  feasibility  study,  environment  and  social  impact  assessment, \nfinancial and economic analysis, credit review and pricing notes, subloan agreement, and other \nlegal contracts and agreements), (iii) conduct environment and social safeguard (involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples) reviews and clearances, (iv) assess its funding needs and \ndetermine its drawdown schedule, (v) choose the appropriate disbursement methods and prepare \ncontract awards and disbursement projections, (vi) conduct economic and financial analysis of \nthe PPP projects, and (vii) conduct periodic project reviews and prepare audit and compliance \nreports. The TA will help BIFFL meet the project administration requirements outlined in the \nproject administration manual. \n \n12.
