Component 1 will \ndevelop  an  efficient,  effective,  and  accountable  urban  water \nsupply  and  sanitation sector  by  establishing and  implementing \npolicies,  establishing  service  standards,  and  enhancing  sector \ncoordination.  Component  2  will  entail  development  of  safe, \naccessible, and adequate water supply and sanitation facilities in \nabout 20 small towns. Component 3 will strengthen governance \nand capacity for project management and operation. \n   \nRationale  Although  Nepal  is  considered  ahead  of  its  Millennium \n  Development Goal (MDG) target of 73% (95% for urban and 72% \nfor rural) in terms of access to an improved water source, the \nNepal Millennium Development Goals: Progress Report by the \nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  published  in \n2005 cautions against optimism because of serious functionality \nproblems. Based on a survey in 2002, it was reported that water \navailability was only intermittent in many areas, half of the gravity \nflow systems in the hills needed major repair, and more than half \nof the tubewells in the Terai were contaminated. UNDP concludes \nthat Nepal's coverage could be considerably lower if the strict \ndefinition of access to safe drinking water were applied. Access to \nimproved sanitation services was estimated to be only 27% in \n2006  according  to  the  World  Health  Organization  and  United \nNations Children's Fund, and the MDG target of 53% (67% for \nurban and 52% for rural) for sanitation will not be met, if the rate of \nincrease in coverage between 2000 and 2006 is maintained until \n ", "ii \n2015. Currently, 265 towns (153 Terai and 112 hill towns) are \nclassified as small towns in Nepal, with a total population of 3.6 \nmillion. These towns are being developed haphazardly, although \nthey  are  playing  an  important  role  in  creating  economic  links \nbetween the rural areas and the country's urban economy. Water \nsupply in many small towns is deficient both in terms of coverage \nand water quality. There is serious and urgent need to improve \nwater supply and sanitation services in small towns.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  expected  impact  of  the  Project  is  improved  health  and \neconomic and environmental living conditions of people in small \ntowns in Nepal. The expected outcome of the Project is improved, \naffordable, and sustainable water supply and sanitation services \nwhich  are  governed  and  managed  by  locally  accountable \nrepresentative bodies.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $71.7 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $7.5 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A grant of $45.1 million will be provided under ADB's Special \nFunds resources to finance 62.9% of the total project cost.  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The  Government  will  lend  a  portion  of  the  grant  proceeds, \nTerms  estimated to be about $17 million, to the Town Development Fund \n(TDF) at a proposed interest rate of 2%\u20133% per annum with no \nless than 20 years maturity, including a grace period of 5 years. \nThe  TDF  will  onlend  the  funds  to  water  users  and  sanitation \ncommittees (WUSCs) at an interest rate not exceeding 5% per \nannum with a maturity of 20 years including a grace period of 5 \nyears. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 March 2016  \n   \nEstimated Project  September 2015 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  (MPPW),  with \nresponsibility for subproject execution delegated to its Department \nof Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS). \n   \nImplementation  A sector efficiency improvement unit (SEIU) in the MPPW will take \nArrangements  the lead in advancing the sector development (component 1). A \n  project management office (PMO) established in the DWSS will \nbe responsible for the overall project planning and management \nfor  component  2,  including  selection  of  towns,  assistance  for \ndesign, construction supervision and operation and maintenance \n(O&M), and overseeing safeguard compliance. The water supply \nand sanitation divisional or subdivisional offices (WSSDOs) of the \nDWSS, under the guidance of the PMO, will carry out overall \nmanagement  of  individual  subprojects,  such  as  supporting  the \nfeasibility  studies  and  detailed  designs,  managing  the \n ", "  iii\n \nperformance  of  design  and  supervision  consultants  (DSCs), \nengaging  and  supervising  the  services  provided  by  local \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  providing  technical \nsupport for O&M. The regional monitoring and supervision offices \nof the DWSS will supervise and support the WSSDO in the region. \nWUSCs  will  be  responsible  for  O&M  of  the  water  supply  and \nsanitation facilities constructed.  \n   \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed under an ADB grant will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). The civil works contract, which will \ninclude  the  technical  operation  of  the  system  for  1  year  after \ncompletion  of  the  construction,  will  be  made  for  each  town, \ncombining  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities.  Civil  works \ncontracts  valued  at  more  than  $1  million  equivalent  and \nequipment  contracts  valued  at  more  than  $500,000  will  be \nundertaken through international competitive bidding procedures, \nwhile civil works contracts valued at $1 million equivalent or less \nand  equipment  contracts  valued  at  $500,000  or  less  will  be \nprocured  following  national  competitive  bidding  procedures \ngenerally  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  Public \nProcurement Regulations 2007 and Public Procurement Act 2007 \nand acceptable to ADB. Packages valued at $100,000 or less will \nbe procured under shopping procedures. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  to  (i)  support  sector \ndevelopment; (ii) support project management, monitoring, and \nevaluation  at  the  central  level;  (iii)  carry  out  design  and \nconstruction  supervision  for  individual  subprojects,  including \nmonitoring for safeguards compliance; and (iv) provide training \nand  capacity  development  programs  for  WUSCs  and  other \ninstitutions on financial, technical, and managerial aspects. An \nestimated  2,170  person-months  (56  international  and  2,114 \nnational) of consulting services are needed.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project is expected to provide a high level of water supply \nBeneficiaries  services  to  about  240,000  people  in  about  20  small  towns. \nSanitation services\u2014such as on-site sanitation (private latrines), \npublic toilets, wastewater management facilities (if justified), and \nstorm water drainage\u2014will also be provided in the same towns \nthrough an integrated approach. About 270,000 people will have \naccess to and use improved sanitation facilities. Supplemented by \nhealth  and  hygiene  education  programs  in  these  towns,  the \nProject will bring significant health benefits, to be measured by the \nreduction in the occurrence of waterborne diseases. Time saving \nfor water collection, in particular in hill towns, will be another major \nbenefit expected from the Project, mainly for women and children. \n   \n ", "iv \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Government  is  currently  in  a  transition  to  a  new  federal \nstructure. The peace process remains complex and challenging, \nand  the  ongoing  movement  in  the  Terai  region  demanding \nautonomy and adequate representation in key state institutions is \nlikely to continue. This could affect the Government's commitment \nto sector development as well as the process of decentralization \nand  devolution  of  functions.  However,  the  Government's \ncommitment to sector efficiency improvement is currently strong \nand is expected to remain so in the near future, and the direction \nof federalism being debated is in line with increased roles and \nfunctions of local governments and community organizations. \n \nThe unstable security situation is likely to continue, in particular in \nthe Terai, and there is a risk of delay in subproject design and \nconstruction due to difficulties in fielding the Government staff, \nconsultants,  and  contractors.  The  Project  implementation \nschedule  has  taken  into  account  some  potential  delay,  but \nexperiences in the previous project show that, due to the nature of \nthe  Project\u2014which  is  provision  of  water  supply  and  sanitation \nservices to communities\u2014risks for disturbance are expected to be \nmuch smaller than projects in other sectors.  \n \nThe Project's financial sustainability assumes an appropriate tariff \nlevel  to  recover  at  least  necessary  capital  and  O&M  costs. \nAwareness raising about tariff payment and use of safe water will \nbe started early in the project preparation stage for water users \nand  WUSC  members,  and  realistic  assessment  will  be  made \nregarding the amount of water to be used, based on which the \nappropriate tariff level will be proposed. More concessional terms \nof subloans from the TDF to WUSCs will significantly ease the \nburden of cost recovery.  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL  \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Nepal for the Second Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Urbanization. In 2001 Nepal had a relatively low urbanization level, with an urban \npopulation of 14%. However, internal migration into urban areas is rapidly increasing and the \nurban population is expected to reach 24% by 2017. Due to lack of proper planning and \nhaphazard urban development, severe deficiencies in all kinds of urban infrastructure and \nservices have become a major problem for the economic and social development of the country.  \n \n3.  Water Supply and Sanitation. The Government of Nepal, with the assistance of a \nvariety of multilateral and bilateral development partners and nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs),  has  made  considerable  efforts  to  provide  improved  water  supply  and  sanitation \nservices to people living in both the urban and rural areas of Nepal. The main resource for \ndomestic supplies in the Terai1 is groundwater from the shallow and deeper aquifers, whereas in \nthe hills people rely on springs and streams. The quantity and quality of, and therefore access \nto, water, however, is compromised by population and development pressures, competing uses, \nlack  of  infrastructure,  and,  in  some  cases,  poor  water  resource  management.  Shallow \ngroundwater and surface streams are the most vulnerable to contamination, including arsenic in \nsome areas. In addition, there are acute shortages during dry periods. \n4.  The Three-Year Interim Plan (FY2008\u2013FY2010) of the Government reports that 76.6% \nof the population had access to basic drinking water services and 45.8% had access to basic \nsanitation services in 2006. The plan sets the target of 85% for access to basic drinking water \nservices and 60% for access to basic sanitation services by the end of the interim plan period. \nThe  most  recent  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  and  United  Nations  Children's  Fund \n(UNICEF) joint monitoring report2 indicates even better coverage for water supply, with 94% of \nthe urban population and 88% of the rural population estimated to have access to improved \ndrinking water sources in 2006, although the figures are substantially lower, at 49% in urban \nareas and 11% in rural areas, in terms of house connections. The WHO and UNICEF joint \nmonitoring report shows that improved sanitation is available to only 27% of the population \n(45% for urban and 24% for rural) in 2006. Sector analysis is provided in Appendix 2. \n \n5.  Small Towns. In Nepal, small towns have been emerging due to internal migration \ncaused by inadequate economic opportunities and services and facilities in rural areas and the \nrecent conflict. In order to improve water supply and sanitation services in these small towns, in \nJanuary 2000 the Government endorsed the 15-year Development Plan for Small Towns Water \nSupply and Sanitation. It quantified the water supply and sanitation needs of small towns, \nestimated the cost of providing the improved services, and proposed an institutional framework. \nTwo hundred and nine towns were identified as small towns, with a total population of 2.14 \nmillion. In the 8 years to 2008, however, major improvement of water supply services was \n                                                 \n1  The Terai is the southern plain area bordering India. \n2  WHO and UNICEF. 2008. Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation. Progress on Drinking Water \nand Sanitation: Special Focus on Sanitation. New York and Geneva. \n ", "2 \nprovided to only 32 towns, out of which 29 were supported by the Asian Development Bank's \n(ADB's)  Small  Towns  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  (STWSSSP-I),  and  the \nremaining three by a grant from the Government of Japan.  \n6.  In the technical assistance for preparing the Project,3 the 15-year development plan has \nbeen updated and small towns have been redefined within the framework of the National Urban \nPolicy (2007) as follows: (i) population of 5,000\u201340,000; (ii) located on a road linked to the \nstrategic road network; and (iii) having at least one secondary school and a health post in \naddition to grid electricity, basic telecommunications, and banking. Two hundred and sixty five \ntowns (153 Terai towns and 112 hill towns) with a total population of 3.6 million satisfy the \ncriteria. These towns are being developed haphazardly, although they are playing an important \nrole in creating economic links between the rural areas and the country's urban economy. \nAccording to the original plan, only 45% of the population in small towns had access to piped \nwater supply, irrespective of the water quality, and the current coverage is likely to be similar. \nOn sanitation, coverage of three towns studied ranged from 36% to 81%. Although there is \nserious and urgent need, support to improve water supply and sanitation services in small towns \nfrom both the Government and from development partners has been severely limited.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  Service Quality of Water Supply. Although the access ratio on water supply mentioned \nabove shows that Nepal is ahead of its Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of 73% \n(95% for urban and 72% for rural) in 2015, the Nepal Millennium Development Goals: Progress \nReport by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)4 cautions against optimism \nbecause  of  serious  functionality  problems.  Based  on  a  survey  conducted  in  2002,  it  was \nreported that water availability was only intermittent in many areas, half the gravity flow systems \nin  the  hills  needed  major  repair,  and  more  than  half  the  tubewells  in  the  Terai  were \ncontaminated. Arsenic contamination is also a major issue in some areas in the Terai where \nwater supply depends on shallow wells. UNDP concludes that Nepal's coverage could be \nconsiderably lower if the strict definition of access to safe drinking water were applied. Taking \ninto account functionality and water quality, the implication would be that Nepal is seriously \nbehind in achieving its MDG target for water supply. \n \n8.  Sanitation  Coverage. There is strong need to improve sanitation services delivery, \nparticularly in small towns which are similar in terms of rural access figures, in order to meet the \nMDG target of 53% (67% for urban and 52% for rural). Assuming that the rate of increase in \ncoverage between 2000 and 2006 is maintained until 2015, it appears that the MDG target for \nsanitation will not be met in either urban or rural areas.  \n \n9.  Lessons. In 2000, ADB provided a loan of $35 million for the STWSSSP-I to assist the \nGovernment in providing water supply and sanitation services in 29 small towns. The detailed \nanalysis of phase I is in Supplementary Appendix A. The STWSSSP-I, completed in November \n2008, has brought about substantial benefits in terms of (i) successfully introducing community \ninvolvement and strong ownership, (ii) introducing the principle of cost sharing to water users \neven for the capital cost, (iii) significantly reducing the occurrence of waterborne diseases, (iv) \ngreater involvement of women in particular in community mobilization and decision making, and \n(v) savings in time and labor to fetch water, which is normally the work of women and children. \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2007. Preparing the Improved Water Quality, Sanitation and Service Delivery Sector Development Program. \nManila. \n4  UNDP. 2005. Nepal Millennium Development Goals: Progress Report. New York.  \n ", "    3 \nShortcomings observed are described in the following paragraphs, together with the changes \nthat have been reflected in the design of the Project.  \n \n10.  Technical  Sustainability.  Some  water  supply  systems  constructed  under  the \nSTWSSSP-I faced problems such as poor construction quality, lack of technical expertise of \nwater users and sanitation committees (WUSCs), and inadequate backup support, which is \nadversely affecting the effective operation of the system. In the Project, the water supply and \nsanitation  divisional  or  subdivisional  offices  (WSSDOs) 5  will,  under  the  guidance  and \nsupervision of the project management office (PMO), carry out overall management of individual \nsubprojects from the planning stage, instead of establishing a town project office in each town, \nwhich lasts only during the project period. The WSSDOs will also strengthen construction \nsupervision,  assisted  by  design  and  supervision  consultants  (DSCs),  and  will  work  as  a \ntechnical  backstop  agency  for  WUSCs  even  after  completion  of  construction.  Technical \noperation of the system in the first year will be entrusted to the contractor, and this is expected \nto improve the quality of construction work.   \n \n11.  Financial  Sustainability.  Delay  in  construction  as  well  as  the  low  number  of  tap \nconnections is putting a number of WUSCs in the STWSSSP-I towns in a difficult situation in \nrepaying the loan to the Town Development Fund (TDF) on time. In Terai locations, easy \navailability of groundwater to the households at their premises, though often unsafe due to \ncontamination, seems to be the main reason for the low number of tap connections and low \nwater use. Another significant reason is the high tap connection fee6 for drinking water supply. \nTo overcome these bottlenecks, subloans from the TDF in the Project will be made more \nconcessional, with a longer grace period (proposed to be 5 years), a longer repayment period \n(15 years after grace period) and a lower interest rate (proposed to be not exceeding 5% per \nannum).  Output-based  aid  (OBA)\u2014performance-based  grants  to  be  provided  primarily  to \nfacilitate  the  connection  of  poor  people's  houses  to  the  water  supply  and  to  sanitation \nservices\u2014will increase the connection of the poor without compromising financial viability.  \n \n12.  Fifteen percent in-kind or cash contribution, on top of 5% upfront cash contribution, by \nWUSCs for the water supply component was reported problematic in the STWSSSP-I.7 In the \nProject, WUSCs will be given flexibility, with a choice between increased borrowing from the \nTDF  and  its  own  initial  contribution,  depending  on  the  willingness  and  capability  of  the \nbeneficiaries. The cash contribution will be 5%\u201315%, including 5% upfront contribution, and the \nremaining 35%\u201345% will be a loan from the TDF. A reduced initial cash contribution will enable \nthe connection fee to be lowered, if not eliminated. A 50% contribution from WUSCs is in line \nwith the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Policy (UWSSSP) that requires communities \nand/or  municipalities  to  contribute  not  less  than  30%,  depending  upon  the  socioeconomic \nstatus. Operation and maintenance (O&M) costs will be fully recovered through tariff collection.  \n \n13.  Training and Capacity Building. Under the STWSSSP-I, the TDF, DSC, and national \nNGOs provided various types of technical, financial, and social training programs to WUSC \nmembers. While trainings given by the TDF on financial aspects and by the DSC on technical \n                                                 \n5  Forty two divisional offices, 28 subdivisional offices, and 5 regional monitoring and supervision offices in 75 districts \nare hereinafter collectively referred to as WSSDOs.  \n6  The connection fee was in the range of $100\u2013$150 per household in most towns under the STWSSSP-I. This was \nseparately charged from connection costs of about $60\u2013$70 per household.  \n7  In reality, there was little in-kind contribution, and many towns collected high connection fees and connection costs, \namong other charges, to satisfy the total 20% requirements. Another problem observed was difficult synchronization \nbetween the main contractor's work and the community work carried out using the community contribution, which \nresulted in delay and poor quality.     \n ", "4 \naspects were generally found effective and appreciated by WUSCs, observations have been \nmade that (i) training programs were not held in a timely manner, (ii) trainings were not frequent \nenough to create results, and (iii) participants who received training did not remain in the \nrelevant posts. The PMO, its consultants, and the DSC will plan more carefully and implement \nthe capacity building programs for WUSC members and WUSC's employees in accordance with \nthe construction schedule and progress. A monitoring mechanism to measure the effectiveness \nof  training  programs  will  be  established  by  the  PMO.  The  Central  Human  Resources \nDevelopment Unit (CHRDU), under the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS), \nwill also be brought in and strengthened so that it can help equip WUSCs with more business-\noriented management skills, in addition to technical and financial management capabilities, \neven beyond the Project period.   \n \n14.  Policy and Legal Framework. Development of the legislative and policy framework for \nNepal\u2019s water and sanitation sector is a relatively recent phenomenon, taking place primarily \nover the last 10 years to 2009. The policy and legal framework has developed incrementally \nwith  separate  policies  and  regulations  adopted  and  enacted  for  water  resources,  national \nsanitation, rural water supply and sanitation, water quality, and urban development. Major acts \nand regulations relevant to the Project include the Drinking Water Regulation (1998), National \nWater Supply Sector Policy (1998), Local Self Governance Act (1999), Local Self Governance \nRegulations (1999), National Water Plan (2005), National Drinking Water Quality Standards \n(NDWQS)  (2005),  and  National  Urban  Policy  (2007).  Some  inconsistencies  are  observed \namong the acts and regulations, and translating policies and plans into actions in the context of \ndecentralization and community empowerment is a key challenge.  \n15.  The Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) has finalized and the Government \nhas subsequently approved the UWSSSP. As a next step, an action plan will be developed to \nfacilitate  policy  implementation.  The  Government  currently  does  not  have  policies  and \nguidelines focused on wastewater management, which will be another priority action of the \nMPPW. The Government intends to develop an umbrella water supply and sanitation act by \nconsolidating existing acts, although adequate consideration needs to be made with regard to \nthe finalization of Nepal\u2019s new political structure and constitution which is anticipated to provide \nadditional powers to local governments under a new federated structure beyond 2010. As a \nmajor development partner in the water supply and sanitation sector as well as in the urban \nsector, it is critical that ADB remains engaged in policy dialogue with the Government and \nprovides necessary support for smooth and effective sector development.  \n16.  External Assistance. In recent years, ADB has been the largest development partner in \nthe urban water supply and sanitation sector, followed by the Government of Japan through the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) and German development cooperation through \nKfW and GTZ. ADB has been chairing the development partners' group for urban development, \nand assisted the Government in drafting the UWSSSP and updating the 15-year Small Towns \nDevelopment Plan.8 External assistance is outlined in Appendix 3. JICA has recently agreed to \nprovide technical cooperation for capacity development on water supply in semi-urban areas, \nunder which the technical support system of the DWSS to WUSCs is to be improved in a few \ndistricts. GTZ has been providing support for strengthening the financial and management \ncapacity of the TDF under the Urban Development through Local Efforts program.  \n                                                 \n8  Technical assistance was provided through the Preparing the Improved Water Quality, Sanitation and Service \nDelivery Sector Development Program.   \n ", "    5 \n17.  Sector Lending. The Project will follow a sector lending modality.9 This is considered \nappropriate because (i) the Government has prepared the 15-year Development Plan for Small \nTowns Water Supply and Sanitation (2000\u20132015) and in May 2009 endorsed the updated 15-\nyear plan that is satisfactory to ADB; (ii) the MPPW and DWSS have the institutional capacity to \nimplement the updated 15-year plan with substantial experience gained through past ADB-\nassisted water supply and sanitation projects including the STWSSSP-I; and (iii) the MPPW \nfinalized  the  UWSSSP  in  May  2009,  also  satisfactory  to  ADB,  and  the  Government \nsubsequently  approved  it  in  August  2009.  The  Project  will  assist  the  Government  in \nimplementing the updated 15-year plan and the UWSSSP.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n18.  The expected impact of the Project is improved health and economic and environmental \nliving conditions of people in small towns in Nepal. The expected outcome of the Project is \nimproved, affordable, and sustainable water supply and sanitation services which are governed \nand managed by locally accountable representative bodies.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n19.  The Project has three components. Component 1 will develop an efficient, effective, and \naccountable  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector  by  establishing  and  implementing \npolicies, establishing service standards, and enhancing sector coordination. Component 2 will \nentail development of safe, accessible, and adequate water supply and sanitation facilities in \nabout 20 towns. Component 3 will strengthen governance and capacity for project management \nand operation. \n \n1.  Component 1: Developing an Efficient, Effective, and Accountable Urban \nWater Supply and Sanitation Sector \n20.  The output of component 1 is developing an efficient, effective, and accountable urban \nwater supply and sanitation sector. The Project will support sector development spearheaded by \nthe  MPPW,  in  particular  the  sector  efficiency  improvement  unit  (SEIU)  established  in  July \n2009.10  \n \n21.  While the legal and policy framework of the water supply and sanitation sector has \ngradually been developed over the last 10 years to 2009, the sector needs further improvement \nin terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability. Initial tasks of the SEIU will include (i) \nsupporting  the  implementation  of  the  UWSSSP,  with  its  clear  monitoring  and  evaluation \nmechanism put in place; (ii) establishing water supply and sanitation service standards and \nmeasuring and monitoring performance of service levels provided by all utilities (including local \ngovernments and WUSCs); (iii) enhancing sector coordination; and (iv) assisting the formulation \nof new laws, policies, and guidelines that fall under the responsibility of the MPPW, including the \numbrella water supply and sanitation act and national technical standards for sewerage and \nwastewater management. This component will cover incremental recurrent costs in the SEIU, \nequipment, and consultancy support to the SEIU. \n                                                 \n9  The term used in the ADB's Operations Manual (OM Section D3) was followed, although the Project is funded on a \ngrant basis.  \n10  Monitoring and Evaluation Unit for rural water supply and sanitation in the MPPW will be integrated into the SEIU. \n ", "6 \n22.  Performance Monitoring and Improvement. The SEIU will establish service standards \nfor water supply and sanitation services, performance indicators and targets, and a performance \nevaluation system, followed by actual collection and compilation of indicators, performance \nevaluation for improvement of the services in the medium-to-long term, and documentation and \npublication of the assessment results. In addition, the SEIU will review the governance structure \nof WUSCs and other water supply and sanitation service providers and provide guidelines for \nimproved governance in the context of decentralization and devolution. As needed, the roles \nand functions of central government agencies, including the DWSS, will be redefined to focus \nmore on policy implementation, sector planning and monitoring, and establishment of regulation \nand technical standards. Promotion of private sector participation, including as an operator for \nservice delivery, will be examined.  \n \n2.  Component 2: Developing Water Supply and Sanitation Facilities \n23.  The output of component 2 is developing safe, accessible, and adequate water supply \nand sanitation facilities in about 20 towns, with an average population of 16,000 per town. This \ncomponent will be implemented in two batches, with each batch consisting of about 10 towns.11 \nThe criteria for selecting small towns and subprojects are in Appendix 4.  \n \n24.  Water Supply. Water supply in many small towns is deficient in terms of both coverage \nand quality. Coverage needs to be expanded with augmented water supply from surface water \nsources (normally in the hills) or from groundwater sources (normally in the Terai). Even in \nareas where water is supplied through a piped system or shallow tubewells, current water \nsupply is usually intermittent, limited in quantity, and the quality is not suitable for drinking. The \nProject will support the development of additional water sources, construction of water treatment \nfacilities 12  and  storage  tanks,  and  rehabilitation  and/or  expansion  of  transmission  and \ndistribution systems in about 20 small towns. It is intended that the piped water supply system \nwill achieve the following service level:13 (i) increased per capita water supply (90\u2013100 liters per \ncapita per day for private house connections), (ii) 24-hour water supply with adequate residual \npressure, (iii) at least 90% coverage of the service area after 5 years of operation, (iv) treated \nwater satisfying the NDWQS, and (v) predominantly private house connections. Public\u2013private \npartnerships, through such options as service or management contracts, will be piloted in a few \ntowns.     \n \n25.  Sanitation.  Addressing  sanitation  and  wastewater  management  is  essential, \nparticularly as water supply will be augmented. In Nepal, wastewater management is still in its \ninfancy and currently implemented only in a small number of large towns. In order to maximize \nthe Project benefits in terms of improving the health of beneficiaries, an integrated water supply \nand sanitation subproject14 will be planned and implemented in all towns under the Project. \nLocal NGOs will be engaged in each town for public awareness raising and health and hygiene \neducation. The Project will support construction of sanitation facilities, such as public toilets and \n                                                 \n11 For batch 1, towns that have completed at least feasibility studies will be selected. Currently the detailed design is \navailable for 12 towns, and the feasibility study is available for 11 more towns (including 3 sample subprojects studied \nunder the project preparatory technical assistance).  \n12 Depending on the raw water quality, expected water treatment could include sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection \n(chlorination) to satisfy the NDWQS.  \n13 There is a minor difference from the high level of services defined in the UWSSSP which has the following criteria: (i) \nmore than 100 liters per capita per day of water supply, (ii) quality meeting NDWQS, (iii) fully plumbed within the \nhouse, (iv) 24 hours supply, and (v) 12 months continuity. The level of services provided under the Project is also \nconsidered high as the difference is minor and the Project takes account of the situation in small towns in terms of \nwater demand. \n14 In each town, a subproject is referred to as a town project.  \n ", "    7 \nsludge drying beds for septic tank sludge disposal, in about 20 small towns. Where population \ndensity is high and investment is economically justified, wastewater management systems will \nbe introduced as pilot projects in several towns. The type of treatment to be used largely \ndepends on the available funds and the land, but natural treatment systems such as waste \nstabilization  ponds  or  the  reed  bed  treatment  method  are  generally  preferred  due  to  the \nrelatively small operation costs and past experiences. Each household is principally responsible \nfor on-site sanitation (private latrines), but grants through the OBA approach will be provided to \nhouseholds to facilitate construction of private latrines, in association with awareness raising \nactivities.  \n \n26.  Storm water drainage is a major problem in most of the Terai towns. The Project will \nsupport construction of drainage systems in the core areas of the project towns. Solid-waste \nmanagement will be included to ensure effective operation of sanitation facilities, with focus on \ncommunity 3R (reduce, reuse, and recycle) activities. \n \n27.  Output-Based Aid.15 The Project proposes a strategy for using explicit performance-\nbased grants to deliver water supply and sanitation services primarily to the poor and vulnerable \ngroups. Under the OBA, grants will be given to service providers, i.e., WUSCs, after delivery of \nthe household connections has been verified by an independent verification agent. Grants will \nbe provided to carefully selected households16 for water supply and sanitation services, the \ndetails of which will be determined by each WUSC. This will enhance service delivery without \ncompromising financial viability. The framework of the OBA is in Appendix 5.  \n \n28.  This component will include civil works and equipment in about 20 towns, OBA, and \nproject planning and implementation support from the DSC and local NGOs. To ensure more \neffective and long-term involvement, local NGOs will be engaged in each town to promote \ncommunity awareness and implement a gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) action plan \n(by contrast, national NGOs were used in the STWSSSP-I).  \n \n3.  Component 3: Strengthening Governance and Capacity for Project \nManagement and Operation  \n29.  This component will support smooth and effective Project implementation and operation. \nAdequate training and capacity building programs will be provided to WUSCs, WSSDOs, and \nregional monitoring and supervision office by the PMC, DSC, TDF, CHRDU, and local NGOs. \nThe PMO in DWSS, with the support from the PMC, will manage and monitor overall project \nimplementation through the project performance management system (PPMS) to be developed \nfor the Project. This component will cover the PMC, equipment, and incremental recurrent costs \nin the PMO and WSSDOs. To assist WUSCs in getting proactively involved in construction \nmanagement and in taking over the system smoothly, the administrative cost for engaging \nmanagement staff to be retained by WUSCs (who will take operational responsibility for the \nsystem), will be partially paid from this component.17 The PMO, assisted by the PMC, will \nensure  that  five  regional  water  quality  and  meter  calibration  laboratories18 become  fully \n                                                 \n15 The UWSSSP addresses the OBA to facilitate the access of poor people to water supply and sanitation services. \nSpecific guidelines will be prepared by the SEIU. \n16 It is intended that the poor will be targeted and selected for the water supply connection, while even non-poor may be \neligible for grants for the construction of private latrines.  \n17 It is proposed that 50% of the recurrent cost for engaging up to two technical and/or financial managers will be paid \nby the Project for a maximum of 2 years, if not later than 1 year after the completion of construction.  \n18 Necessary equipment has been provided under STWSSSP-I, but staff recruitment is still in progress. It is expected \nthat meters to be procured in the Project will have to be certified in these laboratories.   \n ", "8 \noperational  so  that  these  laboratories  conduct  water  quality  testing  and  meter  calibration \nservices for WUSCs.   \n \n30.  The PMO, its consultants, and the DSC will plan and implement the capacity building \nprograms for WUSC members and employees in accordance with the construction schedule \nand progress.19 A monitoring mechanism to measure the effectiveness of training programs will \nbe established by the PMO as part of the PPMS. The CHRDU, under the DWSS, will be brought \nin and strengthened so that it can help equip WUSC members and/or employees with business-\noriented management skills, in addition to technical and financial management capabilities, \neven beyond the Project period.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n31.  Introduction of Output-Based Aid. OBA, a strategy for using explicit performance-\nbased  grants  to  deliver  basic  services  such  as  water  supply  and  sanitation  where  policy \nconcerns would justify public funding to complement or replace user contribution, will be applied \nto facilitate connection of mainly poor people's houses to water supply and sanitation services. \nOBA, as an approach to help improve aid effectiveness, is increasingly being utilized by other \ndevelopment partners such as the World Bank. In the Project, WUSCs will pre-finance a part of \nthe connection costs for those eligible for OBA grants, mainly through membership fees and/or \ninitial contributions from the non-poor, and ensure the connection of poor people's houses to the \nwater supply and the construction of private latrines with appropriate designs. WUSCs will be \nreimbursed  the  grant  amounts  by  the  Government  after  the  intended  outputs  have  been \nconfirmed by local NGOs working as verification agents. As this is the first attempt of its kind, \nspecific guidelines for OBA  will be prepared by the SEIU, with assistance from the SEIU \nconsultants.   \n \n32.  Construction and First-Year Operation Contract. Smooth start-up of the operation is \nconsidered a key to the success of the Project. Inclusion of technical operation of facilities in the \nfirst year in the main civil works contract, in particular incorporating operational performance in \npayment conditions, is expected to (i) speed up the construction, (ii) ensure good quality of \nconstruction work, and (iii) ensure smooth operation of the facilities. During the first year of \noperation, management staff to be engaged by WUSCs taking operational responsibility for the \nsystem will receive full on-the-job training from the contractors to ensure the seamless transition \nafter the first year of operation.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n33.  The Project investment cost is estimated at $71.7 million, including taxes and duties of \n$7.5 million. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 6.   \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n19 Capacity building programs would include members and/or employees of WUSCs in the STWSSSP-I towns. \n ", "    9 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amount\nA.

Financing Plan \n34.  The Government has requested a grant of $45.1 million from ADB's Special Funds \nresources to help finance the Project. The provision of grant assistance is justified by (i) the \nnature of the Project, which is to satisfy basic needs of water supply and sanitation; (ii) the fact \nthat it has pro-poor orientation; and (iii) the country's tight fiscal position. The grant will cover \n62.9% of the total project cost. The Government will provide $20.5 million equivalent to cover (i) \ntaxes and duties, (ii) a part of civil works costs, (iii) a part of OBA grants, and (iv) a part of \nincremental recurrent Government staff costs. WUSCs (beneficiaries) and local governments \nwill contribute $6.1 million equivalent.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount Share of \nSource  ($ million) Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  45.1    62.9 \nGovernment   20.5    28.6 \nBeneficiaries and Local \n6.1    8.5 \nGovernments  \n  Total    71.7    100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n35.  The Government will lend a portion of the grant proceeds, estimated to be about $17 \nmillion,20 to the TDF at a proposed interest rate of 2%\u20133% per annum with no less than 20 years \nmaturity, including a grace period of 5 years. Final lending terms and conditions between the \nGovernment and the TDF will be mutually agreed upon. All payments received from the TDF \nunder the subsidiary loan agreement will be used for country poverty reduction programs. It has \nbeen proposed that the TDF will onlend the funds to WUSCs at an interest rate not exceeding \n                                                 \n20 Assumed to be 40% of the civil works and equipment cost, excluding the cost for private latrine construction.  \n ", "10 \n5% per annum with a maturity of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years. While reducing \nthe interest rates from the TDF to WUSCs from the level in the STWSSSP-I, the introduction of \na late payment charge will be examined to provide incentives for on-time payment. The balance \nof the grant amount (about $28 million) will be channeled through the Government as a grant \nportion, to be used for subproject investment costs, consulting services, and other costs in \nrespect of the Project. \n \n36.  In each project town, water supply systems will be financed by WUSCs (50%) and the \nGovernment (50%). The initial cash contribution of WUSCs may range between 5% and 15% of \nthe  civil  works  contract,  including  a  5%  upfront  cash  contribution,21 depending  upon  its \nwillingness  and  capability,  with  the  remaining  35%\u201345%  to  be  borrowed  from  the  TDF.22 \nIncreasing the proportion of TDF borrowing, compared to the STWSSSP-I, will ease the burden \nof  collection  of  initial  contribution,  and  enable  gradual  recovery  through  tariff  collection. \nMoreover, the payment method will be changed to alleviate the financial burden during the initial \nyears.23 Public sanitation facilities24\u2014which include public toilets, sludge drying beds, storm \nwater drainage, and wastewater management (if justified)\u2014 will be financed by WUSCs and \nlocal governments25 (15% in total26) and the Government (85%).27 On-site sanitation will be the \nresponsibility of individual households, but grants through the OBA approach will be provided to \nhouseholds  to  facilitate  construction  of  private  latrines.  All  other  related  costs\u2014including \nconsulting services, NGO services, training, capacity building, and incremental administrative \nexpenses\u2014will be financed by the Government using Project funds. \n \n37.  O&M costs for water supply will be fully recovered by WUSCs, while those for sanitation \nservices (sludge management, off-site sanitation, and drainage) will be paid for by WUSCs and \nlocal governments through a mutual agreement. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n38.  The MPPW will be the executing agency, with responsibility for subproject execution \ndelegated to the DWSS. The SEIU established in the MPPW will take the lead in advancing the \nsector development (component 1), with support from SEIU consultants. The SEIU will be \n                                                 \n21 In the STWSSSP-I, an upfront 5% cash contribution and additional 15% contribution (in-kind or cash) were required. \nIn reality, there was little in-kind contribution, and many towns collected high connection fees ($100\u2013$150 per \nhousehold) and connection costs ($60\u2013$70 per household), among others, to satisfy the requirements. This created \nproblems, such as difficult synchronization between the main contractor's work and the community work (using the \n15% contribution) resulting in delay and poor quality, and less connection by the poor due to high initial costs. \nSubproject costs that will not be included in the civil works contract, such as compensation for land acquisition and \nresettlement, if any, will be separately collected and paid by WUSCs. It is expected that 5%\u201315% initial contribution \nwill be made mainly through collection of connection costs.   \n22 This will be repaid from tariffs to be collected by WUSCs.   \n23 An alternative payment method, under which the sum of principal repayment and interest payment will be equal in \neach installment throughout the repayment period, may be adopted by WUSCs, which is different from the equal \nprincipal repayment method. These changes will enable the tariff level for recovering payment or repayment to the \nTDF and full O&M expenditure to be set at an affordable level of less than 3% of income even for low-income \nhouseholds in three sample subprojects studied under the project preparatory technical assistance. \n24 No cash contribution is expected from WUSCs and local governments for solid-waste management, as the scope is \nmostly focused on awareness raising and community mobilization for 3R activities.  \n25 \"Local governments\" refers to municipalities and village development committees (VDCs).  \n26 Share between WUSC and local government will be agreed upon in each town before the commencement of detailed \ndesign. WUSC may borrow from the TDF a part of its share.   \n27 Sanitation will require a higher contribution from the Government as there are limited demands from the public due to \nfear of high investment costs, but inclusion in the system will bring significant public health benefits. \n ", "    11 \nheaded  by  the  joint  secretary  of  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  division  and  consist  of \ndedicated staff including one at undersecretary level. The PMO established in the DWSS will be \nresponsible  for  the  overall  project  planning  and  management  for  component  2,  including \nselection  of  towns;  recruitment  of  PMC  and  DSC;  procurement  of  civil  works  contractors; \nassistance  for  design,  construction  supervision,  and  O&M;  and  overseeing  safeguard \ncompliance. The PMO will be headed by an experienced full-time project director, supported by \ntwo full-time deputy project directors. The WSSDO of the DWSS, under the guidance of the \nPMO,  will  carry  out  overall  management  of  individual  subprojects,  such  as  supporting  the \nfeasibility studies and detailed designs, managing the performance of the DSCs, recruiting and \nsupervising local NGOs, and providing technical support for O&M.  For each subproject, a \ndedicated core group headed by a qualified engineer under the supervision of the WSSDO head \nwill undertake day-to-day project management. The regional monitoring and supervision office \nof  the  DWSS  will  supervise  and  support  WSSDO  in  the  region.  The  implementation \narrangement is in Appendix 7.   \n \n39.  Functions of Water Users and Sanitation Committees.28 WUSCs will be responsible \nfor O&M of the water supply and sanitation facilities constructed. When a WUSC does not exist \ninitially, an interim service area committee (ISAC) will be first established in the feasibility stage \nby representing potential consumers. The ISAC will assist the DSC in undertaking a feasibility \nstudy, make inputs into and agree with the technical proposals, and decide on the boundaries of \nthe service areas. WUSCs will be developed from ISACs at the detailed design stage, and will \nbe responsible for (i) working with the DSC in finalizing the detailed design; (ii) land acquisition \nand resettlement, if any; (iii) participating in the bidding evaluation process and signing the \ncontact with the main civil works contractor as a witness; (iv) fulfilling required contribution; (v) \nconcluding a subsidiary loan agreement with the TDF; (vi) supervising the construction work and \nendorsing the payment; (vii) setting water tariffs at a level to cover necessary payment or \nrepayment  to  the  TDF,  O&M  expenditures,  and  replacement  and  future  expansion  in \naccordance  with  the  UWSSSP;  and  (viii)  ensuring  smooth  house  connections.  After  the \nconstruction  completion,  WUSCs  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  operating  and  maintaining  the \nsystem, and expanding the system, when appropriate; (ii) collecting the tariff; and (iii) repaying \nthe debt to the TDF. WUSCs normally consist of nine executive members, at least three of \nwhom are women. An operation or supervision unit is to be established under the WUSC before \nthe construction completion, and this unit will operate the system or supervise the operator, if \noutsourced. After the first year of technical operation by the contractor, WUSCs will be given \noptions as to whether they (i) continue to engage the same operator with agreed fees, (ii) \nengage a separate operator through competitive bidding, or (iii) operate the system through the \nunit. \n \n40.  Local Governments. Local governments, i.e., village development committees (VDCs) \nand municipalities, are responsible for ensuring effective and efficient operation of the system \nby WUSCs, and will facilitate the access of WUSCs to a TDF loan as well as the loan recovery \nfrom  the  WUSC  to  the  TDF.  They  will  also  contribute  a  part  of  investment  and  O&M \nexpenditures  for  off-site  sanitation  facilities,  in  agreement  with  WUSCs.  The  following \nagreements will be concluded for subproject implementation: (i) a general agreement among \nlocal governments, WUSCs, PMO, and TDF specifying, among other things, (a) the proportion \nof cost sharing both for water supply and sanitation systems; and (b) the principle of integrated \nwater  supply  and  sanitation,  tariff  collection,  and  the  OBA,  before  the  commencement  of \n                                                 \n28 WUSCs are to be registered with the district water resources committee as a user association under the Water \nResources Act (1992).  \n ", "12 \ndetailed design work;29 (ii) an agreement among the same four parties specifying, among other \nthings, (a) the amount of contribution from each party; (b) the proposed level of tariff to be \ncollected by WUSCs; (c) the commitment of WUSCs to recover payment and repayment, O&M \nexpenditures, replacement, and future expansion in accordance with the UWSSSP; and (d) the \ntarget and level of grant to be given under the OBA, before the contract award; and (iii) a \nsubsidiary loan agreement between the TDF and WUSC before the contract award.  \n \n41.  Town Development Fund. The TDF is a Government-owned autonomous body that \nprovides  financial,  technical,  and  institutional  support  to  the  institutions  engaged  in  town \ndevelopment. The TDF has been strengthened by gaining experiences from KfW grants and the \nSTWSSSP-I. The TDF will be responsible for the financial sustainability of subprojects, and it \nwill (i) examine the subproject costs in connection with the repayment capabilities of the WUSCs \nin coordination with the DSCs and PMO; (ii) recommend and monitor tariffs to cover O&M \nexpenditures, debt service payment, and replacement and future expansion in accordance with \nthe  UWSSSP;  (iii)  provide  training  in  tariff  setting,  bookkeeping,  accounting,  and  financial \nmanagement to members and/or employees of WUSCs; and (iv) disburse and collect loans. The \nTDF may, in consultation with the DWSS, send the records of payment and/or repayment from \nWUSCs and the performance of local governments as a facilitator to the Ministry of Local \nDevelopment (MLD) to seek necessary support from the ministry. Assessment of the TDF is in \nSupplementary Appendix B.  \n \n42.  Central Human Resources Development Unit. The CHRDU was established in 1987 \nwithin the DWSS to work as the center for human resource development for water supply and \nsanitation services. The CHRDU will provide training on technical matters and management \nskills  such  as  business  plan  development,  management  of  outsourcing,  and  customer \nrelationships.  The  PMO  will  support  strengthening  functions  of  the  CHRDU  through \ndevelopment of appropriate programs and training of resource persons.   \n \n43.  Coordination Committees. At the central level, a project coordination committee will be \nset up with the secretary of the MPPW as the chair and the joint secretary of the MPPW as the \nalternate chair. The committee will comprise the director general of the DWSS, the executive \ndirector of the TDF, and senior representatives from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), MLD, the \nMinistry of Health and Population, the Ministry of Law and Justice, and the National Planning \nCommission.  The  PMO  director  will  serve  as  member-secretary.  The  project  coordination \ncommittee will meet at least twice a year to review the overall progress and discuss key issues \nto be addressed at the central level. In each town, a town project coordination committee \n(TPCC) will be established. If a subproject is implemented in a municipality, the TPCC will be \nchaired by the mayor30 of the municipality, and represented by the executive officer of the \nmunicipality, WSSDO, and WUSC. If it is located in a VDC, the TPCC will be chaired by the \nhead of the WSSDO, and represented by the WUSC and the VDC, until political leadership31 is \nin place in the VDC, after which time the VDC chair will co-chair the TPCC. Representatives of \neducation and health units of local governments will also be members of the TPCC, to ensure \nthe  sustained  efforts  for  health  and  hygiene  education  beyond  the  construction  period. \nRepresentatives  from  the  district  development  committee,  PMO,  regional  monitoring  and \nsupervision office, TDF, the contractor, DSC, and local NGO will also be invited when needed. \nTPCCs will meet quarterly, or as often as necessary, to oversee the subproject progress and \n                                                 \n29 This will mean the commencement of detailed design review for towns where the detailed design is already available. \n30 Until the mayor is elected, the chief executive officer deputed from the MLD, acting as mayor, will chair the TPCC.   \n31 Political leadership refers to either the elected chair, or the chair selected via consensus among political parties.  \n ", "    13 \neffectiveness of all relevant activities and discuss any issues to ensure smooth implementation \nand operation. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n44.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years and is expected to end in September \n2015. Start-up activities will include establishing the PMO and SEIU, recruiting consultants and \nproject staff, and selecting towns under batch 1. Component 2 will be implemented in two \nbatches, each consisting of about 10 towns, and the construction period is expected to be from \nJuly 2011 to June 2013 for batch 1 and from July 2012 to June 2014 for batch 2. The Project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 8.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n45.  All procurement to be financed under an ADB grant will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The civil works \ncontract, which will include the technical operation of the system for 1 year after completion of \nthe construction, will be made for each town, combining water supply and sanitation facilities. \nCivil works contracts valued at more than $1 million equivalent and equipment contracts valued \nat more than $500,000 will be undertaken through international competitive bidding procedures, \nwhile civil works contracts valued at $1 million equivalent or less and equipment contracts \nvalued at $500,000 or less will be procured following national competitive bidding procedures \ngenerally  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Regulations  2007  and \nPublic Procurement Act 2007 and acceptable to ADB. Packages valued at $100,000 or less will \nbe procured under shopping procedures. The procurement plan is in Appendix 9, and the \nprocurement capacity assessment report and recommendations are in Supplementary Appendix \nC. \n \n46.  Advance  Contracting  and  Retroactive  Financing.  ADB  has  approved  the \nGovernment's request of advance contracting for engaging the PMC, DSC, SEIU consultants \nand local NGOs, and retroactive financing for (i) the services to be provided by the consultants \nand NGOs, and (ii) the operation of the PMO and SEIU. Retroactive financing will be up to 20% \nof the total ADB grant amount for eligible expenditures incurred prior to grant effectiveness but \nnot earlier than 12 months prior to the signing of the grant agreement and in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) for the \nrecruitment of PMC, DSC, SEIU consultants, and local NGOs. The Government has been \nadvised that ADB's approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing would not commit \nADB to subsequently approve and finance the Project.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n47.  Consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nConsulting  services  will  be  provided  to  (i)  support  project  management,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation  at  the  central  level;  (ii)  support  sector  development;  (iii)  carry  out  design  and \nconstruction  supervision  for  individual  subprojects,  including  monitoring  for  safeguards \ncompliance; and (iv) provide training and capacity development programs for WUSCs and other \ninstitutions on financial, technical, and managerial aspects.32 The PMC, to be recruited by the \nPMO,  will  require  24  person-months  of  international  expertise  and  308  person-months  of \n                                                 \n32 Training may include overseas field visits for government officials, including project staff, for issues such as service \nlevel benchmarking, water safety, and wastewater management.  \n ", "14 \nnational expertise. The SEIU will recruit the SEIU consultant, which will require 32 person-\nmonths of international expertise and 120 person-months of national expertise. Three DSCs will \nbe engaged in each batch, all to be recruited by the PMO, with each contract covering 3\u20134 \ntowns. In total, all contracts for the DSCs will require 1,686 person-months of national expertise. \nThe proposed outline terms of reference are in Supplementary Appendixes D, E, and F. All \nconsulting firms will be selected using the quality and cost-based selection method with a \nstandard quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. \n \n48.  Local NGOs will be engaged for each town by the WSSDO to (i) inform communities and \nassist with the formulation of ISACs and/or WUSCs, (ii) conduct socioeconomic surveys and \nidentify those eligible for OBA grants, (iii) provide health and hygiene education, (iv) implement \nthe GESI action plan, (v) support the implementation of house connections under the OBA, and \n(vi)  assist  with  the  implementation  of  resettlement  plans.  Local  NGOs  will  also  act  as  an \nindependent verification agent under the OBA framework to verify that agreed outputs have \nactually been delivered. The WSSDO will engage local NGOs using selection criteria including \n(i) experience relevant to the project objectives, (ii) ties with the project town, (iii) financial \nintegrity, and (iv) record of proven competence in group formation. The proposed outline terms \nof reference are in Supplementary Appendix G.   \n \n5.  Anticorruption Policy  \n49.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the executing agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n50.  Transparency. The Project intends to maximize transparency. The DWSS will set up a \nwebsite  within  2  months  from  the  grant  effectiveness  and  disclose  all  key  project-related \ninformation, including the main framework of the Project, criteria for selecting small towns and \nsubprojects, results of town selection, project safeguard reports such as initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) and resettlement plans, and project progress such as procurement and \ncontract  award.  WUSCs  will  also  fully  disclose  town  project-related  information\u2014such  as \nsubproject cost, cost-sharing arrangement, progress of construction, connection cost and fee, \nfinancial status, available grant scheme (OBA), and the endorsed list of those eligible for OBA\u2014\nthrough  public  briefings,  bulletin  boards,  or  at  the  general  assembly  of  the  WUSC.  Full \ninformation disclosure and participatory monitoring are expected to be effective in reducing the \nrisk of corruption and improving governance at central and local levels. Grievances regarding \nsubprojects will be first addressed at WUSCs, but if not completely redressed, they will then be \ndiscussed at the TPCC.    \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n51.  Grant  disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements between the \nGovernment and ADB. To ensure the timely release of grant proceeds and to expedite project \nimplementation, the Government will, immediately after grant effectiveness, establish an imprest \n ", "    15 \naccount at the Nepal Rastra Bank for the Project for the MPPW. The initial and maximum \namount  to  be  deposited  into  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  estimated  ADB-financed \nexpenditures for the next 6 months, or 10% of the grant, whichever is less.  \n \n52.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  maintained,  audited,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements between the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  The  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedure  will  be  adopted  to \nreimburse eligible expenditures or liquidate advances provided into the imprest account. Any \nindividual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under SOE procedure will not exceed the \nequivalent of $100,000.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n53.  The DWSS will provide ADB with quarterly progress reports on project implementation. It \nwill prepare information on the Project's physical progress and status of project management \n(components 2 and 3), and consolidate them with other issues (mainly component 1) and \nsubmit a combined report to ADB within 1 month of the end of the applicable period. Within 6 \nmonths of physical completion of the Project, the DWSS will submit to ADB a project completion \nreport. \n \n54.  Financial management assessment undertaken for the DWSS and TDF has revealed \nthat they have satisfactory financial management arrangements and project accounting systems \nin place, gained through experience of working on ADB projects in the past. The DWSS will \nmaintain  separate  project  accounts  and  records  to facilitate  identification  of  all  goods  and \nservices financed by the grant proceeds and counterpart funds. The PMO will be staffed with an \nadequate number of suitably qualified accounting personnel. Consolidated project accounts and \nrelated financial statements will be audited annually by the auditor general. The Government will \nsubmit to ADB, within 9 months after the end of each fiscal year, audited reports and related \nfinancial statements, which include a separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account \nand SOE procedure. The TDF will be subject to annual audit by auditors acceptable to ADB, \nand will submit to ADB a copy of the audited statements of project accounts and financial \nstatements within 9 months after the end of each fiscal year. Furthermore, ADB reserves the \nright to verify the financial accounts of the DWSS and TDF to confirm that the share of ADB\u2019s \nfinancing is used in accordance with ADB\u2019s policies and procedures. Financial management \ncapacity of WUSCs needs to be strengthened, and the TDF and consultants will provide support \nfor their capacity development.  \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n55.  The PMO will establish a PPMS, with the support of the PMC, in line with ADB's PPMS \nframework. The system will ensure that the project components are managed efficiently and \nbenefits  are  maximized.  The  PPMS  developed  by  the  DWSS  in  the  STWSSSP-I  will  be \nimproved in terms of better collection of baseline data\u2014such as incidence of water-related \ndiseases and quality and quantity of water supply services available, and the level of on-site \nsanitation  facilities\u2014disaggregated  by  income  levels,  sex,  caste,  and  ethnicity.  Under  the \nguidance of the SEIU, the PMO will conduct a benchmark survey for batch 1 towns and submit \nfor ADB's review and concurrence an implementation plan for monitoring performance and \npreparing  benchmark  information  within  9  months  of  grant  effectiveness.  These  baseline \nsurveys will be conducted in accordance with the design and monitoring framework and provide \nthe basis for preparing the benchmark information and targets. After the initial survey, the PMO \n ", "16 \nwill  submit  annual  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  reports  to  ADB  throughout  project \nimplementation, and a comprehensive completion survey.   \n \n9.  Project Review \n56.  The Government and ADB will jointly review the Project at least twice a year. This \nincludes  (i)  the  performance  of  the  SEIU,  DWSS,  TDF,  PMO,  regional  monitoring  and \nsupervision offices, WSSDOs, WUSCs, consultants, NGOs, and contractors; (ii) progress of \nsector development, physical progress of subprojects, and capacity building; (iii) inclusion of \npoor and vulnerable groups in subproject planning and implementation; (iv) compliance with \ngrant assurances; and (v) assessment of subproject sustainability in technical and financial \nterms.  In  addition  to  the  regular  reviews,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  undertake  a \ncomprehensive midterm review in the third year of project implementation to identify problems \nand constraints encountered and suggest measures to address them. Specific items to be \nreviewed will include (i) appropriateness of scope, design, implementation arrangements, and \nschedule of activities, including the OBA; (ii) assessment of implementation pace against project \nindicators;  (iii)  effectiveness  of  training  and  capacity  building;  (iv)  evaluation  of  the  policy \nimplementation, establishment, and monitoring of service standards and sector coordination for \neffective and efficient sector development; (v) compliance with safeguard measures; (vi) extent \nto which the GESI is being met in subprojects; (vii) lessons learned, good practices, and \npotential for replication; and (viii) changes recommended.   \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Benefits and Impacts  \n57.  The Project is expected to provide a high level of water supply services to about 240,000 \npeople in about 20 small towns by the end of the Project. Sanitation services, such as on-site \nsanitation (private latrines), public toilets, wastewater management facilities (if justified), and \nstorm water drainage, will also be provided in the same towns through an integrated approach. \nAbout 270,000 people will have access to and use improved sanitation facilities by the end of \nthe Project. Supplemented by health and hygiene education programs in these towns, the \nProject will bring significant health benefits, to be measured by the reduction in the occurrence \nof waterborne diseases. Time savings for water collection, particularly in hill towns, will be \nanother  major  benefit  expected  from  the  Project,  and  this  will  mainly  benefit  women  and \nchildren.  \n \n58.  Water  supply  and  sanitation  subprojects  will  bring  significant  economic  benefits, \nalthough health and environmental benefits in particular from sanitation subprojects are hard to \nquantify due to the lack of area-specific data. The economic analysis of subprojects has been \nconducted for the three sample subprojects, and these subprojects have been found to be \neconomically viable (Supplementary Appendix H), with economic internal rates of return ranging \nfrom 15.6% to 20.9%. These subprojects have also been found to be financially sustainable \n(Supplementary Appendix I). The financial analysis found that the tariff level to cover O&M costs \nand loan repayments throughout the project period would be within 3% of the monthly income, \neven for poor households.  \n \n59.  Gender Equality and Social Inclusion. The Project will implement the GESI Action \nPlan (Appendix 10) to address different impacts on, and needs of, women, the poor, and \nvulnerable  groups.  Gender  mainstreaming  in  overall  project  planning,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation processes will be effectively applied for gender-responsive service \n ", "    17 \ndelivery. Women will directly benefit from the Project in terms of their participation in WUSCs \nand in decision-making processes. It is expected that the piped water system will lead to time \nand labor savings for collecting water\u2014especially for women and children\u2014thereby increasing \nthe  possibility  of  women's  engagement  in  productive  economic,  social,  and  capacity \ndevelopment activities.  \n \n60.  The  Project  will  directly  benefit  socially  and  economically  vulnerable  caste  and \nindigenous groups. Dalits,33 indigenous peoples, Muslims, and other minorities will be given due \nattention to equally benefit from improved water supply and sanitation systems. The OBA \napproach will ensure that the poor among these groups are adequately included and connected \nto water supply and sanitation services. Social mobilization through local NGOs will help raise \nawareness  among  these  groups  and  facilitate  their  effective  participation  in  WUSCs.  The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11.  \n \nB.  Environmental and Social Safeguards \n61.  Environmental Safeguards. The Project is classified category B in accordance with \nADB's  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  The \nDWSS has prepared IEEs for three sample subprojects (Supplementary Appendix J) as part of \nthe feasibility study, and an environmental assessment and review procedure (EARP). The \nEARP has specified the requirements for project screening and classification, environmental \ncriteria for selection of subprojects, information disclosure and consultation with the affected \npeople including the establishment of grievance redress committees, environmental assessment, \nand development of an environmental management plan. Following the EARP, the DSC will \nprepare an IEE or an environmental impact assessment (EIA) and monitor the implementation \nof the environmental management plan, with guidance from the WSSDO and PMO. IEEs will be \napproved  by  the  MPPW,  while  EIAs  (if  needed)  will  be  approved  by  the  Ministry  of  the \nEnvironment. EIA reports of category A and IEE reports of category B-sensitive subprojects (if \nany) will also be submitted to ADB for review and concurrence. The PMO will be responsible for \nensuring  that  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plans  will  be  implemented  to  meet  the \nGovernment laws and regulations and ADB's Environment Policy.  \n \n62.  The summary environmental assessment of the Project is in Appendix 12 and the full \nEARP is in Supplementary Appendix K. The IEE reports found that the planned subprojects \nwould have only small and localized adverse impacts on the environment and these can be \nmitigated. Mitigation measures and monitoring plans have been proposed in the IEE. Because \nof the small size of the subprojects and scattered location of towns to be selected, cumulative \nand long-term negative environmental impacts are not anticipated. Improvement in sanitation \nand solid-waste management, together with wastewater management in a few pilot towns, will \nhave significant positive impacts on community hygiene and sanitary conditions.  \n \n63.  Social  Safeguards.  The  Project's  category  for  involuntary  resettlement  is  B  in \naccordance with ADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). Out of three sample subprojects \nstudied, two require small-scale land acquisition for water and/or wastewater treatment plants \nand reservoir tanks, and thus short resettlement plans have been prepared (Supplementary \nAppendix L). To ensure compliance with the Government's and ADB's policy requirements, a \nresettlement framework to guide the preparation and implementation of subprojects has been \nformulated by the DWSS. Its summary is in Appendix 13 and the full resettlement framework is \nin Supplementary Appendix M. If any subprojects require land acquisition and/or resettlement, a \n                                                 \n33 Dalit refers to the lowest caste (\"untouchable\") in the Hindu caste system. \n ", "18 \nresettlement  plan  will  be  prepared  based  on  the  resettlement  framework.  WUSCs  will  be \nresponsible for the implementation of the resettlement plan, and the DWSS will ensure that \nWUSCs comply with the resettlement framework and the resettlement plan. Local NGOs will \nundertake the external monitoring for the resettlement plan implementation. Subprojects that will \ncause significant resettlement impacts will not be selected, although such impacts are not \nanticipated because of their nature and scale.34 Special compensation measures for vulnerable \ngroups, including indigenous people, are also included in the resettlement framework. \n \n64.  The Project's category for indigenous people is B in accordance with ADB's Policy on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998). The Government has recognized 59 different ethnic groups as \nindigenous people, and they comprise 37% of the total population. All three sample subprojects \nidentified indigenous people in the subproject areas, and the same is likely for most subprojects. \nWith water supply and sanitation services improvement, subprojects are expected to result in \nimproved health and time savings benefits for indigenous people. Some indigenous people \nmaintain distinct social and cultural traditions, but most indigenous people in subproject areas \nare economically and politically integrated into the mainstream society. Considering the nature \nand scale of these subprojects, impacts are considered minor and specific actions favorable to \nindigenous people will be a part of the integrated GESI action plan.  \n \nC.  Major Assumptions and Risks \n65.  Political Stability and Commitment. The Government is in transition to a new federal \nstructure, with the new constitution expected to be finalized and approved in 2010. The peace \nprocess remains complex and challenging, and the ongoing movement in the Terai region \ndemanding autonomy and adequate representation in key state institutions is likely to continue. \nThis could affect the Government's commitment to sector development as well as the process of \ndecentralization and devolution of functions. However, the Government's commitment to sector \nefficiency improvement is strong and is expected to remain so in the near future, and the \ndirection of federalism being debated is in line with increased roles and functions of local \ngovernments and community organizations.  \n \n66.  Security in the Terai. The unstable security situation is likely to continue, particularly in \nthe Terai, and there is a risk of delay in subproject design and construction due to difficulties in \nfielding  the  Government  staff,  consultants,  and  contractors.  The  Project  implementation \nschedule has taken into account some potential delay, but experiences in the STWSSSP-I show \nthat, due to the nature of the Project\u2014which is provision of water supply and sanitation services \nto communities\u2014risks for disturbance are expected to be much smaller than projects in other \nsectors.  \n \n67.  Problems of intimidation and collusion in procurement are reportedly widespread, and \nthe extent appears to be greater in the Terai. It is reported that change in the bid submission \nvenue from districts to Kathmandu would considerably reduce such risks. Accordingly, the bid \nsubmission venue for the Project will be Kathmandu, as contractors are centrally procured. An \ninternational procurement and contract management specialist will be engaged in the initial \nperiod of the Project, to ensure that risks of collusion and intimidation in procurement are \nminimized. The Government, led by the Ministry of Finance, has also taken this issue seriously \n                                                 \n34 Involuntary resettlement impacts are considered significant when 200 or more people experience major impacts. \n\"Major impacts\" is defined as involving affected people (i) being physically displaced from housing; and/or (ii) having \n10% or more of their productive, income-generating assets lost.  \n ", "    19 \nand  started  discussions  on  specific  actions  with  various  line  ministries  and  development \npartners including ADB.   \n \n68.  Tariff Setting and Cost Recovery. The Project's financial sustainability assumes an \nappropriate tariff level to recover necessary capital and O&M costs. WUSCs have the tendency \nto keep the tariff level lower than that proposed by the consultant and the TDF during the \ndetailed design stage. Water users, especially those in the Terai, may continue to use cheaper \nbut unsafe water sources (e.g., shallow tubewells), which would lower the total amount of tariff \ncollected. Awareness raising about tariff payment and use of safe water will be started early in \nthe project preparation stage for water users and WUSC members, and realistic assessment will \nbe made regarding the amount of water to be used, based on which the appropriate tariff level \nwill be proposed. More concessional terms of subloans from the TDF to WUSCs will significantly \nease the burden of cost recovery. More effective capacity building programs for WUSCs are \nexpected to improve business planning, technical operation, and financial management.   \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n69.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  MOF will lend a portion of ADB funds to TDF under a subsidiary loan agreement, \nwith proposed terms of an interest rate of 2%\u20133% per annum with not less than 20 \nyears maturity including a grace period of 5 years, to be mutually agreed upon by the \nGovernment and TDF. TDF will onlend such funds to WUSCs with proposed terms of \nan interest rate not exceeding 5% per annum and for a repayment period of 20 years \nincluding a 5-year grace period. \n(ii)  MOF and TDF will finalize the lending agreement and TDF will finalize the standard \nonlending agreement with WUSCs, prior to the first disbursement in respect of civil \nworks and goods with respect to component 2, ensuring that both agreements are \nacceptable to ADB. \n(iii)  The  Government  will  provide  all  required  counterpart  funds  for  project \nimplementation on a timely and regular basis. \n(iv)  The Government will provide adequate support and assistance to SEIU so as to \nensure proper implementation of the UWSSSP and the sector development referred \nto in paragraph 21. \n(v)  The Government will ensure that necessary technical and financial support will be \nprovided to WUSC for O&M of the schemes developed under the Project. \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that there will be no overlap of activities between ADB-\nfunded subprojects and projects funded by other development partners. \n(vii)  MPPW will ensure that all subprojects are selected and implemented in accordance \nwith the town and subproject selection criteria agreed between ADB and MPPW and \nset out in Appendix 4. \n(viii)  MPPW will ensure that framework and guidelines regarding the establishment and \noperation  of  OBA,  to  be  developed  in  accordance  with  Appendix  5,  will  be \nsatisfactory to ADB.  \n(ix)  DWSS will ensure that, within 1 year of grant effectiveness, five regional water \nquality and meter calibration laboratories will become fully operational. \n(x)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  sufficient  funds  to  cover  the  costs  of  land \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement are made available in a timely manner. All \n ", "20 \nland  and  right-of-way  required  will  be  made  available  in  a  timely  manner,  and \ncompensation at replacement value and other entitlements will be paid to affected \npeople prior to the award of any civil works contract.

Status of Water Supply and Sanitation Coverage \n1.  The Government of Nepal, with assistance from a variety of multilateral and bilateral \ndonors and nongovernment organizations (NGOs), has made considerable effort to provide \nimproved water supply and sanitation services to people living in both the urban and rural areas \nof Nepal. The Three-Year Interim Plan (FY2008\u2013FY2010) of the Government reports that 76.6% \nof the population had access to basic drinking water services and 45.8% had access to basic \nsanitation services in 2006, and sets the target of 85% of the population with access to basic \ndrinking water services and 60% with access to basic sanitation services by the end of the \ninterim plan period. The most recent World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations \nChildren's Fund (UNICEF) joint monitoring report1 indicates even better coverage for water \nsupply, with 94% of the urban population and 88% of the rural population estimated to have \naccess to improved drinking water sources in 2006, although the figures are substantially lower, \nat 49% in urban areas and 11% and rural areas, in terms of house connections.  \n2.  Although these figures show that Nepal is ahead of its Millennium Development Goal \n(MDG) target of 73% (95% for urban and 72% for rural) for access to improved water source in \n2015, the Nepal Millennium Development Goals: Progress Report by UNDP cautions against \noptimism because of serious functionality problems.2 Based on a survey in 2002, it was reported \nthat water availability was only intermittent in many areas, half of the gravity flow systems in the \nhills needed major repair, and more than half of the tubewells in the Terai were contaminated. \nArsenic contamination is also a major issue in some areas in the Terai where water supply \ndepends on shallow wells. UNDP concludes that Nepal's coverage could be considerably lower \nif  the  strict  definition  of  access  to  safe  drinking  water  were  applied.  Taking  into  account \nfunctionality  and  water  quality,  the  implication  would  be  that  Nepal  is  seriously  behind  in \nachieving its MDG target for water supply. \n \n3.  The  WHO  and  UNICEF  joint  monitoring  report  shows  that  improved  sanitation  is \navailable to 45% of the urban population but only to 24% of the rural population in 2006. As the \nsituation in small towns is likely to be much closer to the rural figures, there is strong need to \nimprove sanitation services delivery to meet the MDG target of 53% (67% for urban and 52% for \nrural). Assuming that the rate of increase in coverage between 2000 and 2006 is maintained \nuntil 2015, it appears that the MDG target for sanitation will not be met in either urban or rural \nareas.  \n \n4.  For the households that do have sanitary latrines, these are usually pour-flush latrines \nconnected to a disposal pit or to a septic tank. The liquid effluent either infiltrates into the ground \nor is discharged to surface water drains as there are no sewer systems in the smaller urban \nareas. Using storm water drainage as sanitary sewers in this way is a widespread practice in \nNepal,  and  is  a  principal  factor  in  pollution  of  the  nation\u2019s  watercourses.  Wastewater \nmanagement is still in its infancy and currently implemented only in a small number of large \ntowns.  \nB.  Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation \n5.  The  15-year  Development  Plan  for  Small  Towns  Water Supply  and  Sanitation was \nendorsed by the Government in January 2000. It defined small towns (209 towns with a total \npopulation of 2.14 million), quantified the water supply and sanitation needs of small towns, \nestimated the cost of providing the improved services, and proposed an institutional framework. \n                                                 \n1  WHO and UNICEF. 2008.

Nepal Millennium Development Goals: Progress Report. New York.  \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nSmall towns were further classified in terms of water supply coverage as good (existing piped \nwater supply coverage equal to or higher than 75%), satisfactory (between 30% and 75%), and \npoor (less than 30%). In the 8 years to 2008, however, improved water supply services were \nprovided to only 32 towns, out of which 29 were supported by the Asian Development Bank's \n(ADB's)  Small  Towns  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector  Project  (STWSSSP-I)  and  the \nremaining three by a grant from the Government of Japan.  \n6.  In the project preparatory work, the 15-year plan has been updated and small towns \nhave been redefined within the framework of the National Urban Policy (2007) as follows: (i) \npopulation of 5,000\u201340,000; (ii) located on a road linked to the strategic road network; and (iii) \nhaving at least one secondary school and a health post in addition to grid electricity, basic \ntelecommunications, and banking. Two hundred and sixty five towns (153 in the Terai and 112 \nhill towns), with a total population of 3.6 million, satisfy the criteria. These towns are being \ndeveloped haphazardly, although they are playing an important role in creating economic links \nbetween the rural areas and the country's urban economy. According to the original plan, only \n45% of the population in small towns had access to piped water (irrespective of water quality) \nand the current coverage is likely to be similar. Although there is serious and urgent need, \nsupport  to  improve  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  in  small  towns,  both  from  the \nGovernment and from development partners, has been severely limited.  \n \nC.  Policy and Legal Environment  \n7.  Development of the legislative framework for Nepal\u2019s water and sanitation sector is a \nrelatively recent phenomenon taking place primarily over the last 10 years to 2009. The policy \nand  legal  framework  has  developed  incrementally  with  separate  policies  and  regulations \nadopted and enacted for water resources, national sanitation, rural water supply and sanitation, \nwater quality, and urban development.

Some inconsistencies are observed among the acts and regulations, and translating \npolicies and plans into actions in the context of decentralization and community empowerment \nis a key challenge.  \n9.  The National Water Supply Sector Policy 1998 did not adequately specify roles and \nresponsibilities  of  central  government  agencies  and  local  governments  and  issues  of  cost \nsharing  and  recovery.  The  policy  was  never  updated,  while  the  Rural  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation  Sector  Policy  was  adopted  in  2004,  with  specific  provisions  for  community \ncontribution  and  responsibilities  for  operation  and  maintenance.  Under  such  context,  the \nMinistry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) has finalized the Urban Water Supply and \nSanitation  Sector  Policy,  which  has  been  assisted  by  ADB's  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance.  As  a  next  step,  an  action  plan  will  need  to  be  developed  to  facilitate  the \nimplementation of the policy. The Government intends to develop an umbrella water supply and \nsanitation act by consolidating existing acts and regulations.   \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \n \nD.  Institutional Arrangements \n10.  In the 1990s, political liberalization and a focus on decentralization saw important new \nparticipants emerge in the sector, in particular community groups and local governments. New \nworking  methods,  including  a  demand-led,  community-based  participatory  approach,  were \nintroduced  and  communities,  particularly  in  rural  schemes,  were  encouraged  to  take  full \nownership and contribute to the capital costs. \n11.  The MPPW has overall responsibility for water supply and sanitation, within which the \nDepartment of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) is designated as the lead agency for the \ndrinking water and sanitation sector. The DWSS operates through 10 technical divisions based \nin Kathmandu and offices in the five development regions, and has regional and divisional (or \nsubdivisional) offices in all 75 districts of the country.3 As the lead agency, the functions of the \nDWSS include sector planning and coordination, developing technical standards, and managing \ndesign and construction activities for both the urban and rural parts of the sector. The role of the \nDWSS has been shifting from an implementing agency to a facilitator and coordinator in line \nwith decentralization. The DWSS has strengthened its institutional capacity with substantial \nexperiences gained through past ADB-assisted water supply and sanitation projects, such as \nthe Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project and the STWSSSP-I. \n12.  The Ministry of Local Development (MLD) is the lead government body for promoting \nlocal development and decentralization. The ministry achieves this through supporting capacity \nbuilding  in  local  bodies,  i.e.,  district  development  committees,  municipalities,  and  village \ndevelopment  committees  (VDCs).  Under  the  MLD,  the  Department  of  Local  Infrastructure \nDevelopment and Agriculture Roads is responsible for small-village schemes through the district \ntechnical offices and VDCs.  \n13.  The main role defined for district development committees, municipalities, and VDCs in \npromoting the development of water and sanitation facilities is developing local plans, programs, \nand projects, and also providing the materials and financial support to match the projects\u2019 cost \nand technical support. In many cases, actual service provision has been left to water users and \nsanitation committees (WUSCs) in accordance with the Local Self Governance Act and the \nWater  Resources  Act.  WUSCs,  as  elected  representatives  of  the  water  users  association \nmembers,  work  as  investors  of  infrastructure  as  well  as  operators  of  the  completed \ninfrastructure, under the supervision of municipalities or VDCs. The water supply and sanitation \ndivisional and subdivisional offices of the DWSS provide technical support to local governments \nand WUSCs in the development and operation of facilities. \n14.  The  Water  Supply  Tariff  Fixation  Commission  was  established  in  2007  and  is \nresponsible not only for fixing water tariffs but also for ensuring quality standards in service \ndelivery in relation to the level of tariff. Although initially responsible only for Kathmandu, the \ncommission has a plan to establish offices in the regions and to extend its activities to all parts \nof the country, but does not yet have the capacity to do this. \n                                                 \n3  Out of 75 districts, 42 have divisional offices, 28 have subdivisional offices; the regional monitoring and supervision \noffices are responsible for the other five districts in which they are located. \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE WATER AND SANITATION SECTOR \nType of  Amount \nProject Name  assistance  Duration  (million)  Source \nA.

Town Selection \n  \n1.  Data  for  assessing  applications  and  prioritizing  projects  to  be  considered  for  funding \nshould be gathered during a prefeasibility study. These studies should be carried out strictly in \naccordance with the procedures in the implementation guidelines, so that applications can be \ncompared fairly, based on standard data sets.  \n2.  Scoring for Town Selection. Scores will be given in the following manner to select towns: \n(i)  If a town does not fit the definition of a small town,1 it is automatically excluded.  \n(ii)  The  district  development  committee,  with  an  endorsement  from  the  village \ndevelopment committee (VDC) or municipality where the subproject is located, \nhas included or agreed to include the subproject in the district plan and has \nsubmitted a formal subproject application to the Department of Water Supply and \nSewerage (DWSS). \n(iii)  Poverty is weighted so that towns with a higher proportion of poor people score \nmore. The lowest band is set at the poverty line (i.e., people below the poverty \nline).2  \n(iv)  If a town does not have a piped system, it should be awarded maximum points. If \nit has a piped system, the scoring is according to the proportion of the population \nnot served by it. \n(v)  As a measure of hardship, intermittent systems providing less than 10 hours \nservice per day are scored inversely by the number of hours. Waiting time for \nwater would be too complex to assess over a whole town. \n(vi)  Quality is scored according to whether or not the water meets the National \nDrinking Water Quality Standards (NDWQS). \n(vii)  Sanitation  is  scored  proportionate  to  the  number  of  households  not  having \nsanitary latrines. \n(viii)  Additional points are given if the town does not have any system of wastewater \ndrainage. If the town has wastewater drainage but the effluent is discharged \nwithout treatment, it scores fewer points. \n(ix)  Community demand is assessed by the interest shown by people by participating \nin  a  public  meeting  at  the  prefeasibility  stage.  It  assumes  that  the  publicity \nprocess during the prefeasibility study to inform people about the potential project \nhas been carried out in accordance with the implementation guidelines. \n(x)  Project readiness and population growth are measured. Towns that have already \nmade necessary land available and collected upfront cash contributions will be \ngiven additional points. Towns with high population growth rates will also be \nawarded additional points.  \n(xi)  Fair  and  equitable  consideration  will  be  given  to  geographical  and  regional \nbalances. In any event, and unless otherwise agreed by ADB, 2\u20136 towns will be \nselected from each region, and not more than two-thirds of subprojects will be \nlocated either in the Terai or hills. \n \n \n                                                 \n1   A small town is defined as (i) population of 5,000\u201340,000; (ii) located on a road linked to the strategic road network; \nand  (iii)  having  at  least  one  secondary  school  and  a  health  post  in  addition  to  grid  electricity,  basic \ntelecommunications, and banking. \n2  Nepal Living Standards Survey in FY2004 set the average national poverty line as NRs7,696 per year.

Background \n1.  Output-based aid (OBA) is a method for using explicit performance-based grants to \nsupport delivery of basic services where policy concerns justify public funding to complement or \nreplace user charges. The Project proposes a strategy for using OBA to deliver water supply \nand sanitation services to the poor and vulnerable groups in Project towns. Under the OBA, \ngrants will be given to service providers, i.e., water users and sanitation committees (WUSCs), \nafter achievement of specific outputs have been duly verified. The specific outputs are piped \nhousehold  connections  for  water  supply  and  construction  of  private  latrines  for  sanitation. \nGrants will be provided only to poor households for water supply services, and to both poor and \nnon-poor (though at different levels) for sanitation services.  \n \nB.  Unit Costs of Water Supply House Connection and In-house Latrine \n2.  The cost of providing house connection to a household depends upon the distance of \nthe household from the pipe network. The estimated costs for various distances are given in \nTable A5.1. \n \nTable A5.1: Estimated Unit Cost for Water Supply House Connection \nDistance (meters) of the User Household from Pipeline \nParticulars \n10  25 50  75 \nPipe (NRs per meter)  140  140  140  140 \nCost for pipe (NRs)  1,400  3,500  7,000  10,500 \nAccessories (30% of pipe) (NRs)  800  800  800  800 \nWater meter (NRs)  1,200  1,200  1,200  1,200 \nTotal (NRs)  3,400  5,500  9,000  12,500 \nEstimated proportion of poor households (%)   10  40  35  15 \nWeighted average cost (NRs)  7,565 (say 8,000 including miscellaneous costs) \nNote: Labor cost not included assuming household will provide own labor. \nSource: ADB estimates based on the hearing from the DWSS. \n \n3.  As can be seen from Table A5.1, the cost of individual house connection varies greatly \ndepending on the distance from the pipeline. Accordingly, it is considered appropriate to provide \ngrants based on the actual cost of house connection. \n \n4.  The cost of constructing latrines in a household is likely to be uniform. The estimated \ncost of constructing a latrine is given in Table A5.2.  \n \nTable A5.2: Unit Cost for Construction of In-House Latrine (Basic Model) \nParticulars  Estimated cost (NRs) \nCost of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pipe   6 meters x NRs25 per meter = NRs150 \nAccessories and miscellaneous  (lump-sum)   1,800 (including drain pipe) \nCement (3\u20134 bags)  1,600 \nPan  500 \nCistern  950 \nTotal  5,000 \nNote: Labor cost not included assuming household will provide own labor. Substructure up to plinth level considered. \nSource: ADB estimates based on the hearing from the DWSS.  \n \n5.  As the cost of construction of latrines is approximately uniform for the basic model, it is \nappropriate to provide grants based on the uniform cost. \n  \n ", "36  Appendix 5 \nC.  Level and Extent of Grant, and Mode of Payment \n6.  Grants  for  latrine  construction  will be  provided  in  accordance  with  the  Government \nnorms. A fixed unit grant amount1 multiplied by the number of households without access to \nsanitation services will be provided. Distribution of grant among beneficiaries will be determined \nby each town. As construction of a latrine by a household is essentially an individual choice, it is \ndesirable  that  construction  be  done  by  individual  householders  as  per  his  or  her  choice. \nHowever, the Project and the nongovernment organization (NGO) will give all information and \nwill support the household in making an informed decision regarding the type of model, cost of \nmodel, sourcing the material, etc.  \n \n7.  Grants to poor households for water supply house connections will be provided at the \nrate of 50% of actual cost, or NRs6,500, whichever is less. In any project town, the maximum \nproportion of households eligible for grants is equivalent to the district-level poverty ratio in the \nbase year (current year). For example, if a district has a poverty ratio of 30%, then a grant in a \nproject town in such a district will be limited to 30% of total households.  \n \n8.  In order to ensure the quality of house connection, minimize leakages at the connection \npoint, and reduce occurrences of frequent road cuts, it is desirable that house connection for \nwater supply be executed by the main civil works contractor. Grants under the OBA will be \nadmissible  only  if  connections  are  made  by  the  main  civil  works  contractor  during  the \nconstruction period and the first 6 months of the operation and maintenance (O&M) period.  \n \n9.  Payment of the grant amount will be made to the WUSC after house connection has \nbeen verified, as prescribed. \n \nD.  Target Group and Expected Utilization \n10.  Water Supply. In the proposed towns, there are approximately 55,000 households, out \nof which about 30%, i.e., 17,000 households, are poor. Assuming a weighted average amount \nof actual cost as NRs8,000 per poor household for house connection for water supply as \ncalculated in Table A5.1, grant expenditure (50%) for connections to poor households is likely to \nbe NRs68 million (17,000 x NRs4,000). \n \n11.  Sanitation. Assuming that 25% of the poor households and 50% of the general (non-\npoor) households already have latrines, 13,000 (75% of 17,000) poor households and 19,000 \n(50% of 38,000) non-poor households will need to be supported by the Project. The total grant \nis likely to be NRs38.4 million (32,000 x NRs1,2002).  \n \n12.  Accordingly, NRs106.4 million ($1.33 million) will be required for grant support for water \nsupply and sanitation from the Project.  \n \nE.  Eligibility Criteria \n13.  Poor households will be identified using a broad framework outlined in Table A5.3. \n                                                 \n1  In the draft national guidelines for promoting improved sanitation, the unit grant amount per household is NRs1,000 in \nthe Terai, NRs1,200 in the hills, and NRs1,500 in the mountains.    \n2  NRs1,200 per household was assumed, in line with the draft national guidelines mentioned in footnote 1. \n ", "  Appendix 5  37 \nTable A5.3: Eligibility Criteria for Identifying Beneficiaries Under Output-Based Aid \nEligibility Criteriaa \n\u2022  Family members without reliable income and employment-generating opportunities or a wage earner. \n\u2022  Possesses house with separate kitchen, but only one room to stay and without telephone, TV, or refrigerator. \n\u2022  Land holding less than 0.25 hectares.  \n\u2022  Food sufficiency up to 6 months of the year. \n\u2022  Possesses few (1\u20132) large productive cattle and buffalo. \n\u2022  Any member of the household should not be a regular or retired government servant or a regular or retired \nemployee of any private sector organization, or should not be a public representative.  \na At least four out of six criteria, including the last criterion, have to be met.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank assessment. \n \nF.  Identification of Target Beneficiaries \n14.  Identification of target beneficiaries will be done by local NGOs in collaboration with \nWUSCs and design and supervision consultants (DSCs), and under the overall superintendence \nof the project management consultant (PMC) and project management office (PMO). It is very \nimportant to properly identify the eligible households so that the benefits are delivered to the \ndeserving persons and the grant is not misused. Some indicative (rather than comprehensive) \nparameters for target beneficiaries are given below. The actual parameters to be used and the \nprocess to be followed will depend on the context and prevailing circumstances of a town and \nwill be determined by DSCs, NGOs, and WUSCs, and approved by the PMC and/or PMO well \nbefore the actual process of identification. The process has to be participatory and consultative. \n \n(i)  Housing index. This index uses external housing conditions as a proxy for poverty, \nand can be very effective in conditions where there is a consistent relationship \nbetween poverty and housing conditions. Typical factors to be analyzed will include \nuse of construction materials for walls, roofs, etc.; and space in the house such as \nseparate kitchen, separate rooms for children and parents, etc. This method relies on \nthere being a strong correlation between housing conditions and poverty; there is not \na universal relationship\u2014it is very much defined by the context. Where the housing \nindex is adapted to local conditions, perhaps even including other externally visible, \nnonhousing indicators, there is a greater chance of this index being applicable to a \nwider range of contexts. \n(ii)  Participatory wealth ranking. This tool uses a community's own definitions and \nperceptions of poverty, and employs rigorous cross-checking methods to ensure \nconsistency and accuracy of results. This method relies on detailed knowledge of a \ncommunity of itself, and is unlikely to work in contexts where the community is weak, \nor where there are high levels of conflict or mistrust.  \n(iii)  Perceptions of important community leaders. Sometimes, important community \nleaders such as local priests, tailors, school teachers, chairperson of ward, etc., can \ngive useful information about economic status of households. They may be involved \nin the process of identification of target beneficiaries. \n(iv)  Check-list approach. Under this approach, a list of poverty proxies or indicators is \nbuilt on, based on a local understanding of poverty and in consultation with WUSCs. \nScores are then assigned to each indicator, or a poverty-line level determined. The \npoverty level of a household can then be calculated from their score, or number of \nqualifying indicators. \n \n15.  In general, all four methods build on existing information, collect the minimum data \nnecessary for reliable targeting, and follow-up targeting with a motivation process to encourage \nthe poor to benefit from the subproject. Thus, these methods must not be applied blindly but \nadapted to local needs and conditions. A number of choices need to be made which will \ndetermine which tool is used. It has been suggested that all four methods of poverty targeting \n ", "38  Appendix 5 \nare adopted, the findings are triangulated, and the poor identified, integrating all findings in a \nparticipatory way and through consensus. \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The following process will be followed in the implementation of OBA: \n \n1.  Identification, Endorsement, and Application \n \n(i)  The PMO, PMC, DSCs, WUSCs, and NGOs should be in place and fully \nfunctional. \n(ii)  As required in the terms of reference of NGOs, it is the responsibility of the \nNGO, in collaboration with the WUSC, to carry out the socioeconomic survey \nof all the households in the town.  \n(iii)  The NGO, in collaboration with the WUSC, identifies the poor households as \nper  the  eligibility  criteria  and  participatory  consultative  process  of \nidentification mentioned in this framework.  \n(iv)  After identification of target beneficiaries, the WUSC, in collaboration with the \nNGO, should organize a meeting of water users associations and the list of \ntarget beneficiaries should be read out in this meeting, objections invited and \ncorrected, and the final list endorsed. Representatives of water supply and \nsanitation divisional or subdivisional offices (WSSDOs) and DSCs should \nalso attend this meeting.  \n(v)  The NGO should explain the OBA framework to target beneficiaries in the list, \nincluding the level of grant, extent of coverage, and process of delivery of \nwater supply and sanitation services, etc. The details of house water supply \nconnection\u2014including length of pipe, fixtures, water meters, and valves\u2014\nmethod  of  construction  by  the  main  contractor,  and  responsibility  of  the \nhousehold for oversight and quality control in this regard should be explained \nto the target beneficiary household.  \n(vi)  The details of different types of latrine models, cost of each model, type and \nunit costs of material required, level of grant, method of payment of grant, \netc., should be explained by the NGO and the choice of the model should be \nascertained  and  documented.  The  responsibility  of  construction  by  the \nbeneficiary has to be clearly explained to the household by the NGO and the \nlikely time frame of construction by the household should also be ascertained \nand documented.  \n(vii)  Voluntary  application  by  the  target  beneficiary  to  the  WUSC  should  be \nobtained by the NGO, verified, compiled, and recommended to the WUSC by \nthe NGO for approval. \n \n2.  Water Supply After Application \n \n(i)  A list of eligible approved target beneficiaries will be prepared by the NGO \nand a copy will be made available to the main civil works contractor.  \n(ii)  The actual work of house connection is carried out by the main civil works \ncontractor for house connection.  \n(iii)  The contractor should submit a periodic running claim (for example, monthly \nor when a substantial number of connections are made) to the WUSC along \nwith details of work carried out for the target beneficiaries such as name, \naddress, length of pipe used for connection, fixtures and fittings, water meter, \nvalve, etc., user\u2019s contribution, and the amount claimed for each household. \nThe  signature  of  the  user  indicating  satisfactory  completion  of  the  work \nshould be obtained by the contractor. The DSC should certify the claim of the \ncontractor.  \n ", "  Appendix 5  39 \n(iv)  The WUSC will get the list of beneficiaries verified through the local NGO so \nas to ascertain that the house connections have actually been made to the \nintended beneficiaries and that the desired outputs have been achieved. At \nthe same time, the 50% user's contribution should be collected by the WUSC \nwith the help of the NGO.  \n(v)  The  WUSC  should  make  full  payment  to  the  contractor  from  the  funds \navailable from various sources such as initial upfront connection fee and \nactual connection costs recovered from the users.  \n(vi)  The WUSC will periodically get reimbursement from the WSSDO based on \nthe payments actually made to the contractor. Such reimbursement may be \nused as revolving funds by the WUSC for making payments to the contractor \nfor further connections.  \n \n3.  Sanitation After Application \n \n(i)  The WUSC will provide grants to the household, either in cash or in the form \nof  materials  needed,  together  with  some  guidance  for  procurement  of \nmaterials, if the household chooses to procure materials on its own.  \n(ii)  The  actual  work  of  latrine  construction  is  carried  out  by  the  concerned \nhousehold. \n(iii)  Once a latrine has been constructed and made operational by an individual \nhousehold, such household will send a statement to the WUSC informing it of \nthe  completion  of  the  work.  (The  NGO  will  provide  the  format  for  this \napplication.) \n(iv)  The WUSC will ask the NGO to verify that the latrine has been constructed, \nthe quality and workmanship of construction, and whether it is operational, \nand issue a verification report.  \n(v)  The WUSC will send a request for reimbursement of the grant to the WSSDO \ntogether with a verification report and have it reimbursed.  \n \nH.  Evaluation  \n17.  Evaluation of OBA will be carried out on a random sampling basis by an independent \nagency appointed by the PMO for this purpose. It may be appropriate to engage the department \nof sociology, anthropology, management, or economics, etc. of any renowned university for this \npurpose.  \n \n ", "40  Appendix 6 \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A6.1: Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n \nNRs  % of Base \nItem  $ Million  Million  Cost \nA.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe National Living Standard Survey (NLSS II) in FY2004 indicated that incidence of poverty declined sharply\u2014from 41.8% in \nFY1996 to 30.8% in FY2004. This decline was mainly driven by growth in both per capita consumption expenditure and \nincome by an annual average of 4.5%, supported by increased remittance inflows, higher agricultural wages, increased \nconnectivity, and urbanization. Nepal has also made notable progress in various aspects of human development. The child \n(under 5-years old) mortality rate has declined from 118 per 1,000 live births in 1996 to 61 in 2006, the infant (below 1-year) \nmortality rate has decreased from 79 per 1,000 live births to 52 in the same period, and the maternal mortality rate has been \nnearly halved from 539 per 100,000 live births in 1995 to 281 in 2006. Despite the notable progress in overall poverty \nreduction and human development, the NLSS shows a marked increase in income inequality\u2014the Gini coefficient increased \nfrom 34.2% in FY1996 to 41.4% in FY2004. The reduction in poverty has been unevenly distributed. Inequalities across \ngeographic regions and ecological zones and between rural and urban areas remain significant, as do inequalities across \ngender, ethnic, and caste lines.  \n \nIn the context of Nepal, poverty has always been a rural phenomenon. However, the increasing migration of the people from \nrural villages to urban centers for better livelihoods has presented a great challenge to the system to fulfill the growing \ndemands being made of the basic services. The water and sanitation coverage has drastically increased in both rural and \nurban areas from 1990 onwards. In 2006, 76.6% of the total population had access to basic drinking water services; the figure \nwas 46% in 1990. Access to sanitation services was available to 45.8% of the population in 2006. Although there was \ndecreasing gaps in water and sanitation coverage between rural and urban areas, the increasing population in urban centers \nalso increased demands which the current system has not been able to respond to. Small towns, emerging from rural \ncharacteristics, lack basic infrastructure. The poor settlements in these towns are mostly on the periphery and generally \ndenied basic infrastructure including water and sanitation services. Generally, the poor have less access to safe drinking \nwater and sanitation facilities, are not connected to piped systems, and depend upon poor-quality water sources. Women and \nchildren are mainly responsible for the collection of water, and consequently women are adversely affected in situations \nwhere water is scarce and sanitation is poor, and it increases the burden on them for household and health maintenance.  \n \nThe water sector policy of the Government's Three-Year Interim Plan (FY2008\u2013FY2010) aims to contribute to raising living \nstandard and the status of public health by making sustainable and equitable water supply and sanitation services available. \nThe country poverty analysis describes the provision of basic services for the poor, including water-related needs, as being \nfundamental to poverty reduction. The plan includes that the drinking water projects will be made gender friendly and women \nwill be involved institutionally and at all levels. The national Water Plan 2005 has set the target of achieving total population \ncoverage of basic drinking water supply and sanitation services by 2017. Nepal adopted the Millennium Declaration in 2000, \ncommitting to work towards attaining the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.  \n \nThe urban water supply and sanitation sector policy, which has recently been finalized, has as its goal that the policy would be \nto  ensure  the  socioeconomic  development  and  improved  health  status  of  urban  populations,  including  the  poor  and \nmarginalized, through the provision of sustainable water supply and sanitation facilities. The Asian Development Bank's \n(ADB's) country strategy and program for Nepal (2005\u20132009)a emphasizes the role of water supply, sanitation, and urban \ndevelopment infrastructure, and the need to target the poor to reduce both poverty and inequalities. Following these policy \nframeworks, the Project will contribute to helping achieve the Government's goal to provide sustainable and equitable drinking \nwater supply and sanitation services through applying pro-poor approaches so that the poor in the service area will equally \nbenefit from piped water supply system and sanitation. The Project will ensure inclusion of the poor, women, and the \ndisadvantaged caste and ethnic groups by implementing the gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) action plan. Time \nand economic savings gained from a sustainable water supply system will contribute to economic returns and improved \nlivelihoods. It can be expected that reduced time for fetching water will contribute into increased school attendance and \nenrolment of children and increased investment of time for women in productive economic activities. \n \n ", "50  Appendix 11 \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention (MDG-TI) \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe critical issue related to poverty reduction that requires particular attention in Nepal is its unequal benefits to different \ncaste, ethnic groups, and those from different geographical regions. The exclusionary practices embedded through strong \nfeudalistic rules and attitudes in the society have historically and systematically excluded women, dalitsb, indigenous people \n(janajatis), madhesis,c Muslims, religious minorities, and other vulnerable groups from politics, governance, and institutions. \nThe reduction in national poverty between FY1996 and FY2004 led to poverty reduction of 46 percentage points for the upper \ncaste Brahmin/Chhetri group. However, poverty declined by only 21 percentage points among the lower-caste dalits, 10 \npercentage points among the hill janajatis, and 6 percentage points among the Muslims. The NLSS II data shows that the \npoverty incidences of historically marginalized and socially excluded groups\u2014dalits, janajatis, and Muslims, who altogether \nconstitute more than 50% of the total population\u2014are higher than that of Brahmins, Chhetris, and Newars, and above the \nnational average. The incidence of poverty is 19% among the Brahmins/Chhetris and 14% among Newars, compared with \n46% among dalits, 44% among hill janajatis, and 41% among Muslims. The higher poverty incidences are correlated with the \nlower status of the particular caste and ethnic groups in the social hierarchy.  \n \nIn addition to gender identity, the caste and ethnic identities have historically greatly influenced people's access to services, \nbenefits, and participation in development programs. Social exclusion due to gender, caste, and ethnic identity is very much \nrecognized in the country's current political and development discourses. Those who were left out of the mainstream \ndevelopment and overall governance and political representation are mostly from the vulnerable communities. Their inclusion \nin overall development and political representation is crucial in the post-conflict and peace building processes. In changed \npolitical circumstances, the rising voices and calls of dalits, indigenous people, madhesis, women, and other vulnerable \ngroups for integration of their issues into a new constitution and new structural changes in Nepal clearly demand higher \nattention from all concerned. The social inclusion and appropriate representation of these groups is highly recommended in all \nsectors of development interventions. The benefits of the development interventions need to be diverted with conscious \nefforts towards these excluded groups.  \n \nGender-based roles and discrimination are relevant to the water supply system. In Nepal generally, women and children are \nresponsible for fetching water. This role increases the burden on women when there is scarcity of water. Time savings in \nthree completed STWSSSP-I projects were reported to range from 30 minutes to 90 minutes per household. A shorter time to \ncollect water normally results in increased consumption of water, which results in improved hygiene (more frequent personal \nbathing and washing of clothes and utensils) and better livestock maintenance. Health benefits cited by beneficiaries normally \ninclude improved quality of life due to better physical health, reduced mental stress (as a result of less drudgery), and an \nimproved household economy. Improving the quality of life by providing basic water and sanitation services will have a \nprofound bearing on reducing women's burden and poverty levels.  \n \nBy providing access to improved drinking water supply and sanitation, the Project will assist the Government in achieving the \nMDGs. The Project beneficiaries are town dwellers who have received no or limited piped water supply system and have no \naccess to improved sanitation. By addressing the issues of gender, caste, and ethnic-based discrimination, the Project will \nadopt the policy of social inclusion for the excluded and vulnerable while targeting the beneficiary community. These groups \nwill be identified through household surveys, and their socioeconomic situation will be studied to include them within the \nProject activities and to provide them with water and sanitation facilities.  \n \n2. Design Features  \nThe Project will implement a strategy for using explicit performance-based grants (output-based aid [OBA]) to deliver water \nsupply and sanitation services primarily to the poor and vulnerable groups. Under the OBA, grants will be paid to service \nproviders, i.e., the water users and sanitation committees (WUSCs), after delivery of the household connections has been \nverified. Grants will be provided to carefully targeted poor households for water supply services, and at different levels \nbetween the poor and the non-poor for sanitation services.   \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nUnder the Project, low-income families are identified on the basis of annual income. The national poverty line for Nepal based \non consumption is NRs7,696 per household per year (2003). This translates to NRs3,000\u2013NRs4,000 per household per \nmonth, depending on the region. The population below the poverty line for urban areas is 13%, and between 24% and 45% in \nthe various regions in which emerging small towns are located. Central Bureau of Statistics poverty estimates for the Ilakas \n(areas  that  cover  clusters  of  village  development  committees  (VDCs)  and  municipalities)  in  which  the  three  project \npreparatory technical assistance towns are located are 59% for Sukhad, 19% for Duhabi, and 50% for Khandbari municipality. \n\u201cBetter-off\u201d incomes are taken to be those greater than NRs12,844 ($165). Poverty incidence is higher among dalits, highly \nmarginalized ethnic minorities (24 groups classified highly marginalized by the National Foundation for Development of \nIndigenous People, Ministry of Local Development), and religious minorities (Muslims).  \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 11  51 \nStakeholder analysis for the three project preparatory technical assistance towns found that 10%\u201376% live in urban areas and \n24%\u201390% in the more rural peripheral areas. The wealthy and middle class comprise between 5% and 20%. Dominant caste \ngroups like Brahmins, Chhetris, and Newars, and traders from the Terai middle castes, account for 40%\u201350% of the \npopulation. On average, between 60% and 70% of the population is in some way disadvantaged or vulnerable. Ethnic \nminorities account for 30%\u201345%, Muslims 0%\u201313%, and dalits 7%\u201311%. Ethnic minorities can be divided among (i) highly \nmarginalized ethnic minorities, such as Majhi, Tharu ex-Kamaiya, and Dhimal (0%\u2013 2%); (ii) marginalized groups such as \nTharu and Tamang (10%\u201340%); and (iii) disadvantaged ethnic minorities such as the Rai and Magar (2%\u201334%). Other \ndisadvantaged categories are the poor (19%\u201359% of whom are below the poverty line), landless (3%\u201320%), households \nheaded by women (14%\u201322%), and outlying relatively remote villages that are underserved (10%\u201330%). The number of \nProject-affected people is very low, with only a few households in Duhabi and Khandbari in this category.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nAt the central level, workshops were held by inviting key stakeholders (government departments, NGOs, development \npartners, etc.) to discuss the Project design and the draft urban water supply and sanitation sector policy during the project \npreparatory technical assistance. A gender equality and social inclusion strategy has been drafted to ensure effective \nparticipation of stakeholders in the Project. In each of the three sample subproject towns, group discussions and workshops \nwere organized to solicit views from potential beneficiaries of the Project, including vulnerable groups such as dalits and \nindigenous people. Strong support for the Project has been confirmed at these workshops, and suggestions and comments \nmade have been reflected in the design of subprojects.  \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \nA C&P plan was not prepared because the gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) implementation plan to be developed \nand implemented in each town by a local NGO will ensure sufficient consultation and participation of beneficiaries, including \nwomen, the poor, and vulnerable groups.  \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. Gender issues focus on women's subordinated role in households. Their responsibility to manage water for \ndrinking, cooking, and cleaning make them the primary users and managers of water. Hence, women are at the core of the \nProject and its success as they are the main participants and users of water supply facilities. Gender-sensitive processes are \nimportant to all community mobilization and scheme implementation plans. Gender will be an integral part of the GESI \nframework and all components of the Project. To have gender as integral to project success, the institutional capacity and \nstructures are prerequisite in government agencies, the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS), the regional \nmonitoring and supervision offices, and the WSSDOs. Similarly, WUSCs need to be gender balanced and their operations \nneed to be gender responsive. Women from vulnerable groups\u2014dalits, marginalized indigenous groups, and poorest \nhouseholds\u2014need extra attention to ensure their participation in WUSCs and sanitation activities. \n \nBenefits accruing to women will be: \n(cid:131) significant time and energy savings through provision of water points at house; \n(cid:131) participation in decision making on the location and design of water points and latrines so as to meet the full practical \nneeds of women; \n(cid:131) priority for paid positions such as health motivators, sanitation masons, and maintenance caretakers; \n(cid:131) 33% representation on WUSCs;  \n(cid:131) improved community awareness on GESI through training of WUSC members; \n(cid:131) participation of men as well as women in hygiene promotion sessions; recruitment of male as well as female hygiene \npromoters. \n \nGender plan prepared?

Overview  \n \n1.  The Second Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project's environmental \ncategory is B. As part of the feasibility study, three initial environmental examinations (IEEs) \nwere prepared for sample subprojects in Duhabi, Sukhad, and Khandbari. IEE reports conclude \nthat the planned subprojects would have only small-scale, localized impacts on the environment \nand these can be mitigated. Mitigation measures and monitoring plans have been proposed in \nthe IEE and are summarized below. Improvement in sanitation and solid-waste management, \ntogether  with  wastewater  management,  will  substantially  improve  health,  economic,  and \nenvironmental  living  conditions  of these  areas.  The  environmental  assessment and  review \nprocedure (EARP) is also summarized herein.  \n \nB.  Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n2.  The three IEEs (Supplementary Appendix J) show that sample subprojects will result in \nlarge net environmental benefits. The Project is designed to improve environmental quality and \nliving conditions in selected small-town areas through the provision of basic water supply and \nsanitation  services,  including  solid-waste  management.  Three  sample  subproject  IEEs \nconducted for the Project show that net subproject environmental benefits would be positive and \nlarge, and include (i) increased availability of adequate potable water at appropriate pressure \nfrom water supply subprojects; (ii) better public health, particularly reduction in waterborne and \ninfectious diseases; (iii) reduced pollution resulting from sewage treatment and solid-waste \nmanagement focused on community-level 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle); and (iv) improved \naesthetics from the improvement of sewage treatment and solid-waste management. \n \n3.  There  are  no  adverse  cumulative  impacts  as  potential  negative  subproject  impacts \nduring construction and operation will not be significant, and most impacts are localized and \ntemporary.  Environmental  subproject  selection  criteria  (Table  A12.2)  further  ensure  that \nsubprojects will not have significant negative environmental impacts. Impacts that are potentially \nsignificant  and  permanent  in  nature  are  identified,  and  environmental  subproject  selection \ncriteria will not allow subprojects with such impacts. Potential negative impacts and mitigation \nmeasures are summarized in Table A12.1 and no further environmental impact assessment is \nrequired.   \n \nTable A12.1 Summary of Potential Adverse Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \nPotential Negative Impacts  Mitigation Activities and Method \nA.

A project management office (PMO) established in the DWSS \nwill be responsible for overall environmental coordination and management of the Project. \nTowards this, the PMO will be assisted by an environmental expert consultant responsible for \nsupporting and overseeing EARPs at the national level. The expert will support the PMO in the \ninitial screening of subprojects to ensure compliance with subproject selection criteria. He or she \nwill review all IEEs and environmental impact assessments (EIAs), and ensure all government \nand ADB procedures are met including, but not limited to, the ADB Environment Policy (2002) \nand  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines,(2003)  and  the  Government's  Environmental \nProtection Act (1997) and Environmental Protection Rules (1997, amended 2007). The expert \nwill take corrective actions where necessary. He or she will also provide environmental training \nto build capacity within the PMO, regional monitoring and supervision offices, water supply and \nsanitation  divisional  and  subdivisional  offices  (WSSDOs),  and  water  users  and  sanitation \ncommittees (WUSCs), and submit bi-annual environmental progress reports to the MPPW and \nADB.  \n \n5.  The WSSDO of the DWSS will be engaged between the PMO, regional monitoring and \nsupervision  offices,  and  WUSCs,  and  will  provide  technical  support  to  the  design  and \nsupervision consultant (DSC) during IEE or EIA preparation. The WSSDO will also work as a \ntechnical backstop agency for WUSCs, even after construction completion, to assist in the \nsupervision of environmental monitoring during operation and maintenance (O&M).  \n \n6.    An environmental specialist within the DSC will prepare IEEs and EIAs in parallel with \nthe detailed design, and supervise the construction process, in accordance with government \nand ADB requirements. IEEs will be approved by the MPPW through the DWSS, while EIAs (if \nneeded) will be approved by the Ministry of the Environment. EIA reports of category A and IEE \nreports  of  category  B  subprojects  (if  any)  will  also  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and \nconcurrence. The DSC will ensure that all mitigation requirements are integrated into contractor \nbidding documents and that construction works carried out by the contractors strictly follow the \nenvironmental  specifications  detailed  in  environmental  management  plans.  Nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) will assist the WSSDO and WUSC in raising environmental awareness of \nthe local residents. The WUSC is responsible for O&M of all facilities constructed under the \nProject and will receive necessary water quality training from the WSSDO. \n \n    2.  Environmental Monitoring and Reporting \n \n7.    Environmental monitoring will be undertaken during construction and operation of the \nProject. The PMO and WSSDO are responsible for monitoring the overall compliance with \ngovernment and ADB policies and procedures. The DSC environmental specialist, with support \nfrom  the  WSSDO  and  WUSC,  will  monitor  environmental  mitigation  requirements  during \nconstruction to ensure that mitigation is provided and effective in reducing impacts. The WUSC \nwith  support  from  the  WSSDO  will  be  responsible  for  environmental  and  water  quality \nmonitoring during operation. As per government requirements, WUSCs are to provide water \nquality monitoring reports to the district public health office concerned. Under the Project, each \nWUSC will receive water testing kits with upfront training from the DSC and ongoing support \n ", "  Appendix 12  57 \nfrom the WSSDO. Regional DWSS laboratories will conduct regular water testing to ensure \ncompliance with Nepal National Drinking Water Quality Standards (NDWQS). 2 \n \n8.  The  environmental  specialist  in  the  DSC  is  to  prepare  and  submit  quarterly \nenvironmental monitoring and implementation progress reports to the WSSDO and PMO who \nwill  initiate  necessary  follow-up  actions,  if  any.  The  PMO  will  review  the  environmental \nperformance  of  the  Project  through  these  reports,  and  submit  biannual  environmental \nmonitoring progress reports to the MPPW and ADB.   \n \n  3.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure  \n \n9.  Stakeholder consultation is an integral part of the environmental assessment process. \nDuring Project preparation, consultations are to be undertaken by the DSC as an integral part of \nIEE and EIA preparation with various stakeholder groups including government representatives, \nWUSCs, NGOs, and residents of project areas. Consultations for subprojects are to be mainly \nconducted locally, employing various methods (e.g., socioeconomic surveys of households, \nformal meetings, individual and structured discussions, and focus group discussions). Regular \nand continued stakeholder participation at all stages of project design and implementation is to \noccur.  \n \n10.  During subproject preparation, the DWSS is required to provide public notices regarding \ninformation on the Project\u2019s environmental issues as per the government rules. IEEs and EIAs \nwill also be made available upon request. Moreover, a grievance redress committee, chaired by \nthe WSSDO, shall be set up to register grievances of the people regarding technical, social, and \nenvironmental aspects. The process is designed to be transparent, gender responsive, culturally \nappropriate, and commensurate to the risks and adverse impacts of the Project, as well as \nreadily  accessible  to  all  affected  people,  who  are  to  be  appropriately  informed  about  the \nmechanism through media and public outlets. This participatory process shall ensure that all \nviews of the people are adequately reviewed and suitably incorporated into the design and \nimplementation process. \n \n4.  Environmental Selection Criteria for Subprojects \n \n11.  To  help  ensure  compliance  with  Government  and  ADB  policies,  environmental \nsubproject  selection  criteria  have  been  prepared  to  guide  the  implementation  of  future \nsubprojects. A summary of the environmental subproject selection criteria is provided in Table \nA12.2. \n \n12.  The full EARP, based on provisions of the Government\u2019s environmental policies and the \nenvironmental assessment requirements of ADB, is provided in Supplementary Appendix K. \nThe EARP details (i) the environmental assessment and review procedures, (ii) responsibilities \nand authorities involved in environmental assessment and review, and (iii) staffing requirements \nand budgets. \n \nTable A12.2.

Introduction \n \n1.  Project investments will not have significant resettlement impacts as land requirements \nfor proposed water supply and sanitation components are considered small scale. The Second \nSmall Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project further minimizes impacts through \ncareful  design  to  avoid  or  minimize  land  acquisition,  and  utilizes  public  land  and  existing \nfacilities wherever possible. \n \n2.  Short resettlement plans were prepared for two out of three sample subprojects in \nDuhabi  and  Khandbari  (Supplementary  Appendix  L),  where  resettlement  impacts  were \nidentified.1 As indicated by these sample subprojects, the nature of land acquisition is small, \nimpacting  two  households  in  Duhabi  and  seven  households  in  Khandbari.  Impacts  occur \nprimarily to agricultural plots with no structures. The resettlement framework aims to restore the \nlives of any affected person to pre-project levels, with special provisions to improve the status of \nvulnerable groups. Any subprojects determined to cause significant2 resettlement impacts will \nnot  be  considered  for  implementation.  This  summary  captures  the  salient  points  of  the \nresettlement framework.  \n \nB.  Resettlement Framework Policies and Principles \n \n3.  The resettlement framework outlines the objectives, policy principles, and procedures for \nland acquisition (if required), compensation, and other assistance measures for affected people. \nThe resettlement framework is based on national laws including the Land Acquisition Act 2034 \n(1977) and the Land Reform Act 2021 (1964), and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995).  The  three  important  elements  of  the  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  are  (i) \ncompensation  to  replace  lost  assets,  livelihood,  and  income;  (ii)  assistance  for  relocation, \nincluding provision of relocation sites with appropriate facilities and services; and (iii) assistance \nfor rehabilitation to achieve at least the same level of well-being with the project as without it. \nThe  entitlement  matrix  (Table  A13.1)  summarizes  the  main  types  of  losses  and  the \ncorresponding nature and scope of entitlements. Where the entitlement matrix does not cover a \nparticular impact, it can be enhanced in the resettlement plans based on the findings of the \nsocial assessment and detailed measurement survey. Standards described will not be lowered \nbut can be enhanced in the subproject resettlement plans as required. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The Duhabi subproject will impact two households (25 affected people) and Khandbari subproject seven households \n(41 affected people). For each subproject, land ownership and usage are known. All affected people were closely \nconsulted in resettlement plan preparation. No resettlement impacts will occur in Sukhad.  \n2  Resettlement is significant when 200 or more people experience major impacts defined as involving affected people \nbeing physically displaced from housing and/or having 10% or more of their productive, income-generating assets \nlost. \n ", " \n6\nTable A13.1: Entitlement Matrix \n0\n \nType of  Entitled  Responsible \nNo.  Loss  Application  Person  Entitlement  Implementation Issues  Institution(s) \n1a  Loss of land  Full/partial permanent  Owner(s)  with  Land-for-land arrangements, if government land available,  As  per  the  LAA,,  WSSDO,  A\np\nloss  of  homestead,  legal title  of equal productive capacity satisfactory to affected person,  compensation  for  land  WUSC,  NGO,  p\ne\nagricultural,  vacant  or   determined  through  either  LACFC  n\nd\nland    (i) mutual agreement with    ix\nCash  compensation  equivalent  to  current  market  plot owner, or (ii) the option   1\n3\nrate/replacement value.

Resettlement  plans  will  be  prepared  by  a  resettlement  specialist  within  the  design \nsupervision consultant (DSC) with support from the WUSC and/or NGO, and will include the \nfollowing steps: (i) undertake a detailed census (which is the cut-off date3 for non-titleholders), and \nreplacement cost survey4 of all affected people including titled and non-titled persons, and conduct \na  socioeconomic  survey  of  least  10%  of  all  affected  people  and  20%  of  severely  affected \nhouseholds; (ii) conduct consultation with affected people about the likely subproject impacts, and \nprinciples  and  entitlements  as  per  the  resettlement  framework;  (iii)  based  on  surveys  and \nconsultation  with  affected  people,  prepare  the  draft  resettlement  plan  with  time-bound \nimplementation schedule, procedures for grievance mechanism, and monitoring and evaluation, \nand  a  budget;  (iv)  make  draft  resettlement  plan  available  to  affected  people;  (v)  finalize \nresettlement plan and submit to ADB for approval; and (vi) translate and disclose final resettlement \nplan to affected people and post on ADB's website.  \n \nD.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n5.  The Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) is the national executing agency of \nthe Project. A project management office (PMO) will be established in the DWSS responsible for \ncoordinating, monitoring, and supervising resettlement activity for the Project. The DWSS divisional \nor subdivisional offices (WSSDOs) will provide field support for the PMO. The WSSDOs will ensure \nthat WUSCs implement resettlement plans, which will be assisted and monitored by NGOs. Each \nof these institutions involved in resettlement planning will receive necessary training from the \nproject  management  consultant  (PMC)  resettlement  expert.  Further  details  on  agencies \nresponsible for resettlement plan activities are in Table A13.2.  \n \nTable A13.2: Institutional Roles and Responsibilities \nActivity  Responsible Agency \nSubproject Initiation Stage \nDisclosure of proposed subproject details by issuing public notice  PMO/WSSDO \nDisclosure of proposed land acquisition  PMO/WSSDO \nResettlement Plan Preparation and Updating Stage \nIdentification and verification of affected people  DSC resettlement specialist /WUSC/NGO \nConducting detailed census, socioeconomic, and replacement cost  DSC resettlement specialist /WUSC/NGO \nsurveys of all affected persons \nConducting consultations with affected people and other stakeholders  WSSDO/WUSC/NGO/DSC  resettlement \nthrough FGDs/meetings/workshops.

Those who encroach into the subproject area \n  after the cut-off date will not be entitled to compensation or any other assistance. \n4   A replacement cost survey for various types of affected assets will be a basis for determining compensation rates \n  at  replacement  cost;  however,  replacement  costs  will  be  ultimately  decided  by  the  Land  Acquisition  and \n  Compensation Fixing Committee (LACFC). Data from replacement cost survey can be used for verification of final \n  compensation findings of the LACFC. The compensation amount will ultimately be transferred to a LACFC \n  account to be delivered to affected people in a timely manner. \n ", "66  Appendix 13 \nActivity  Responsible Agency \nGrievance redress   GRC/MOH \nInternal monitoring  WSSDO \nExternal monitoring  NGO \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DSC = design supervision consultant; FGD = focus group discussion, GRC = grievance redress \ncommittee; LACFC = Land Acquisition and Compensation Fixing Committee, MOH = Ministry of Home Affairs; MPPW = Ministry of \nPhysical  Planning  and  Works,  NGO  =  nongovernment  organization,  PMC  =  project  management  consultant,  PMO  =  project \nmanagement office, WSSDO = water supply and sanitation divisional or subdivisional office, WUSC = water users and sanitation \ncommittee. \nSource: Department of Water Supply and Sewerage assessment.  \n \nE.  Consultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n \n6.  The  resettlement  plans  for  Duhabi  and  Khandbari,  including  focus  group  discussions, \nmeetings,  and  individual  interviews,  were  held  involving  affected  households.  Local  language \nversions of the summary resettlement framework and resettlement plans will be made available in \nthe WSSDOs, VDCs, district development committees, WUSCs, and other public locations. The \nresettlement framework and resettlement plans will be posted on ADB\u2019s website and Government \nwebsite,  and  information  dissemination  and  consultation  will  continue  throughout  program \nimplementation. Grievances of affected people will first be brought to the attention of WUSCs. \nGrievances not adressed by the WUSC will be brought to the grievance redress committee (GRC) \nestablished in each town. Further grievances will be handled by the Ministry of Home Affairs which \ncan exercise legal authority through the district court. Records will be kept of all grievances \nreceived including contact details of complainant, date that the complaint was received, nature of \ngrievance, agreed corrective actions and the date these were effected, and final outcome. \n \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n7.  Resettlement  plan  implementation  will  be  closely  monitored  to  provide  the  executing \nagency  with  an  effective  basis  for  assessing  resettlement  progress  and  identifying  potential \ndifficulties and problems. Internal monitoring will be undertaken by the DWSS (PMO and WSSDO) \nand will involve (i) administrative monitoring to ensure that implementation is on schedule and \nproblems are dealt with on a timely basis; (ii) socioeconomic monitoring during and after any \nresettlement  impact  utilizing  baseline  information  from  subproject  preparation;  (iii)  overall \nmonitoring to assess the status of affected people; and (iv) preparation of monthly progress reports \nto be submitted to the PMO, reporting actual achievements against the targets fixed and reasons \nfor  shortfalls,  if  any.  The  selected  local  NGO  will  work  as  an  external  monitoring  agency  to \ndocument  (i)  restoration  of  income  levels;  (ii)  changes  in  occupation  pattern;  (iii)  changes  in \naffected people's type of housing; (iv) assessment of affected people's access to amenities, such \nas  water,  electricity,  and  transportation;  and  (v)  performance  of  WUSCs  in  resettlement \nimplementation. The independent agency (i.e., NGO) will monitor subprojects and submit a report \ndirectly to the WSSDO and PMO upon completion of land acquisition and resettlement. The \nexecuting agency will submit the external monitoring report to ADB for review.  \n \nG.  Resettlement Budget \n \n8.  Detailed  budget  estimates  for  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  prepared  for  each \nresettlement plan by the DSC resettlement specialist and will be included in the overall subproject \ncost  estimate.  The  resettlement  cost  estimate  includes  all  costs  related  to  resettlement \nincluding  compensation,  relocation,  transfer  costs,  displacement  allowances,  rehabilitation \ncosts, administrative costs, special assistance for vulnerable households, and consultation. All \nland acquisition funds will be paid to affected people by the WUSC, and backed by DWSS. Grant \nassurances  will  guarantee  that  affected  people  are  compensated  for  all  losses  as  per  the \nresettlement plan before the award of civil contracts, and NGOs will verify whether compensation \nwas paid and the satisfaction of the affected person. Land acquisition, compensation, relocation, \nand rehabilitation of income and livelihood will be considered as an integral component of project \ncosts. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090827090816+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "rrp: nep 41022, nepal water supply sanitation, nepal water supply projects, nepal water supply sanitation sector projects", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090923113854+08'00'", "Title": "Second Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project"}, "author_page": "NOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government of Nepal ends on 15 July.
