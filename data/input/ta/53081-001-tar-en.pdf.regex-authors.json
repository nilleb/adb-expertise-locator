INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In line with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 operational priority of \nstrengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  this  knowledge  and  support  technical \nassistance (TA) responds to developing member country (DMC) requests to strengthen public \nsector  capacity  to  catalyse  infrastructure  investments\u2014including  through  public\u2013private \npartnerships (PPPs)\u2014in fiscally responsive, development-relevant ways.1 The TA complements \nADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  by  supporting  operations  departments  to  create  improved \nconditions to engage the private sector. Aligned with ADB\u2019s PPP Operational Plan 2012\u20132020,2 \nthe TA will support DMCs in improving institutional and regulatory structures to manage PPP \nappraisal, vet and manage risk, and carry out monitoring and evaluation of PPPs.3 The TA will (i) \nstrengthen the traction of PPP development efforts; (ii) promote fiscally sound public financial \nmanagement (PFM) frameworks for PPPs; and (iii) improve government capacity to design, \nimplement, and manage PPPs (drawing on lessons from international experience).4 The TA is \nincluded in the 2019 results-based work plan of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate \nChange Department.5 \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  High quality, fiscally sustainable infrastructure is a key driver of economic growth and poverty \nalleviation. The Asia and Pacific region suffers from significant infrastructure deficits, particularly \nin terms of quality, quantity, and accessibility. These deficits are particularly severe in energy, \ntransport, and water and sanitation.6 Persistent infrastructure gaps have direct implications for \nhuman development and constrain growth for many countries. Improving infrastructure is an \nexplicit goal of the 2030 sustainable development agenda. Substantial investment from public or \nprivate sources is required to address these infrastructure gaps.7 ADB DMCs will need to invest \n$26 trillion between 2016 and 2030, or $1.7 trillion per year, if the region is to maintain its growth \nmomentum.8 Because the private sector is better equipped to manage key PPP-related risks, the \npublic sector is increasingly turning to the private sector to explore the feasibility of PPPs as a \nmeans of developing and managing critical infrastructure.9 \n \n3.  While private sector participation in the development and operation of public service \nassets is becoming an increasingly viable infrastructure development strategy, in developed \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2018.

Manila.  \n3  The TA project will draw on the ongoing evaluation of ADB\u2019s support for PPPs covering the period 2009\u20132018, which \nexamined the effectiveness and sustainability of ADB\u2019s approach to PPPs in addressing previously identified \nchallenges  and  supporting  evidence-based outcomes.  The  evaluation  draws  on  lessons learned  from  ADB \noperations departments and the Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership. \n4  In view of the operating environments and varying economic profiles of ADB DMCs, ADB bases its PPP operations \non four pillars: advocacy and capacity development, enabling environment, project development, and project \nfinancing. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 July 2019. \n6  ADB. 2017. Meeting Asia\u2019s Infrastructure Needs. Manila. \n7  The G20 Principle for Quality Infrastructure (2019) places renewed emphasis on quality infrastructure investment, \nincluding efforts to mobilize financing from various sources\u2014particularly the private sector and institutional sources \nincluding  multilateral  development  banks\u2014thereby  contributing  to  closing  the  infrastructure  gap,  developing \ninfrastructure as an asset class, and maximizing the positive impacts of infrastructure investment according to \ncountry conditions. \n8  A.

Washington, D.C.  \n \n ", "2 \njurisdictions, DMCs in particular should be cautious about approaching it as a panacea. PPPs can \nbe  financially  advantageous  compared  with  traditional  public  procurement  if  the  cost  of \ntransferring risks to the private sector is lower than the private sector\u2019s cost of finance.10 Pricing \nof risk and competitive tension become the critical determinants of relative efficiency in these \npartnerships, which can explain the difficulties and costly mistakes that most countries experience \nwith PPPs, at least initially.11 International experience has identified many reasons why PPPs \nmight not bring desired benefits. Such reasons include strategically wrong assumptions about \nfuture income streams and inaccurate estimates of risk transfers from the public to the private \nsector.12 Given the complexity of PPPs, DMCs need to build robust policy, regulatory, and \nfinancial  frameworks  and  strengthen  PFM  and  government  institutional  capacity.13 Prudent \napproaches to developing PPPs and sustained efforts to create dedicated expertise on PPPs in \npublic institutions, supported by ADB TA, can be crucial to helping DMCs extract positive \ndevelopment impacts from PPPs. \n \n4.  Four factors can help DMCs have more success with PPPs. First, PPP development can \nonly deliver its promise of value-for-money if it is integrated within effective public investment \nmanagement frameworks. The positive impacts of infrastructure cannot be guaranteed by a \n\u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d approach that simply targets the quantity of infrastructure projects. Improved \npublic investment planning and management are critical to enhancing the efficiency of public \ninfrastructure investment, including through PPPs. \n \n5.  Second, stronger public investment management will result in more predictable, credible, \nefficient,  and  productive  infrastructure  investments  that  avoid  the  main  sources  of  chronic \nrenegotiation  cycles:  unsolicited  proposals  and  opportunistic  bidding  (optimism  bias). \nStrengthening institutions could close-up two-thirds of the public investment efficiency gap.14 Most \ncountries must still benefit from building stricter oversight of PPPs and better integration of \nnational strategic planning with fiscal budgeting and PPP planning. Only with a systematic \napproach can a country's pipeline of PPPs add value-for-money and produce the targeted fiscal \nadvantages. Caution is advised to guard against advice that promotes PPPs as a fiscal magic \nbullet or a \u201clifter\u201d of fiscal constraints. DMCs should look to avoid the frequent and costly mistakes \nof the first movers in the PPP space, and ADB needs to be at the forefront of this broad transfer \nof knowledge and reform effort. This will require a regional approach to ensuring effective sharing \nof experiences and lessons learned. \n \n6.  Third, fiscal risk management systems in DMCs that enter the PPP space must be \nestablished  from  ground-zero.  For  instance,  regarding  viability  gap  funding  (VGF),  many \njurisdictions have either weak regulatory frameworks or limited experience in assessing the level \nof VGF required to ensure bankability. PPPs imply fiscal commitments (contractualized or not) \n                                                \n10 In addition, value-for-money from PPPs reflects (i) private sector access to better technology, (ii) more effective \nproject execution, including revenue collection, and (iii) benefits from bundled construction and management.  \n11 M.

Public Money \nand Management. 37(2). pp. 133\u2013140. Even in emerging markets that have decades of experience with PPPs, such \nas India, \u201cPublic\u2013private partnerships are [still] floundering, mainly due to the opportunistic behavior of private sector \npartners, regulatory uncertainty and poor value-for-money to the government.\u201d K.V.

Making Public Investment More Efficient. Washington, D.C. The IMF define efficiency of public investment \nas the relationship between the value of the public capital stock and the measured coverage and quality of \ninfrastructure assets. \n \n ", "3 \nthat must be carefully weighed (from both a project proposal perspective and a consolidated fiscal \nrisk management angle) prior to commencing negotiations on PPPs.15  \n \n7.  Finally, unstable local-currency markets in DMCs heighten fiscal risks and make it more \ndifficult to attract private sector participation in infrastructure investments, especially from foreign \ninvestors. DMCs need to become more aware of fiscal- and financial-related preconditions \nneeded for sustainable infrastructure development. \n \n8.  ADB experience. During 2009\u20132018, ADB approved 792 projects and TA interventions \nwith  PPP-related  components  (totaling  $51.0  billion,  including  435  TA  grants  totaling \n$660.0 million).16 In line with ADB\u2019s PPP Operational Plan 2012\u20132020, this TA will support ADB \noperations departments in advocating for a fiscally responsible approach to PPPs within DMCs \n(Pillar 1), and in nurturing the institutional and policy environment required to make PPPs an \neffective procurement modality (Pillar 2). The TA will also complement work under Pillar 3, \ncoordinated by ADB\u2019s Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership, on structuring PPP transactions to \nenable a flow of well-prepared and well-structured projects capable of drawing external finance. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: fiscal sustainability of PPP investments in \ninfrastructure projects promoted in DMCs. The TA will have the following outcome: capacity to \nintegrate fiscally sustainable PPPs improved in selected DMCs.17 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks for public\u2013private \npartnership  development  and  management  strengthened  in  DMCs.  To  enhance  fiscal \nsustainability in PPPs in DMCs, ADB will support the review of the legal, policy and regulatory \nframeworks for public investment management. This output will produce (i) assessments of PPP \npolicies and/or laws, based on international experiences and reflecting national priorities, and \npractical solutions for integrating PPP options within line ministries\u2019 infrastructure investment \nplanning processes; (ii) recommendations to support DMCs define institutional responsibilities \nand processes for implementing PPP policies and managing the PPP process flow (with an \nemphasis on environmental sustainability and gender equality); and (iii) recommendations to help \nDMCs improve PFM and procurement policies, laws, and practices\u2014including VGF structures\u2014\nto ensure sound fiscal management of PPPs.18  \n \n                                                \n15 PPP contracts always imply fiscal contingencies and can have direct liabilities (e.g., fixed payments including viability-\ngap payments, availability payments, shadow tolls, or output-based payments), contingent liabilities (e.g., payments \nif a risk occurs), and implicit service delivery risks to the government. \n16 This is based on data provided by the Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership. This comprised (i) 249 sovereign projects \ntotaling  $36.6  billion,  (ii)  108  nonsovereign  projects  totaling  $13.7  billion,  and  (iii)  435  TA  grants  totaling \n$666.0 million. Pillar 4 received the largest share of ADB assistance at $21.9 billion, while Pillar 1 received the least \nat $4.4 billion. \n17 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n18 Several international financial institutions, as a capacity development effort, have developed methodologies/tools \nthat serve important pedagogical purposes in conveying the basic structure of questions and exercises that should \ndetermine a PPP decision-making process. One such example is SOURCE. \n \n ", "4 \n11.  Output 2: Public financial management and fiscal risk management for legacy and \nnew public\u2013private partnerships strengthened in DMCs. This output will support DMCs in \ncoming up with PPP-specific approaches to PFM and fiscal risk management through diagnostic \nassessments and technical support for (i) developing capacity within ministries of finance to \nassess the fiscal implications of PPPs; (ii) evaluating and controlling governments\u2019 fiscal exposure \nto  PPPs;  (iii)  integrating  PPPs  within  medium-term  expenditure  frameworks;  and  (iv) \nstrengthening fiscal reporting and accounting of PPPs.19 \n \n12.  Output  3:  Policy  experience  on  creating  fiscally  sustainable  public\u2013private \npartnerships disseminated to DMCs. The regional approach of this TA allows for the ADB team \nto produce knowledge products, including guidance notes and other practitioners\u2019 tools and \ntechnologies, as well as board policy awareness initiatives to strengthen fiscal sustainability in \nthe PPP policy space. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA with the Governance Thematic Group as the executing and \nimplementing agency. It will report to the Thematic Advisory Service Cluster on TA progress and \nconsult with relevant sector and thematic groups during implementation. It will select, supervise, \nand evaluate consultants; oversee the consultants\u2019 activities to ensure timely and effective \nachievement of the outputs; organize workshops as needed for government capacity building; \nand provide staff to act as resource persons in workshops. The Governance Thematic Group has \nconsulted  closely  with  the  Office  of  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  and  with  ADB  operations \ndepartments to ensure the TA is linked to new or ongoing PPP initiatives adopting a differentiated \napproach of assistance for DMCs.20 \n \n15.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \n \n \n                                                \n19  One stand-alone activity under this output, to be available to all participating DMCs, is the development of a standard \nsupport package for DMCs that are willing to audit PPPs that are either becoming or are likely to become the focus \nof renegotiation attempts and problems. The objective of this activity is to (i) develop the capacity of DMC audit \nauthorities to undertake a function that developed countries undertake as a matter of course, (ii) support policy \ndialogue to develop consistent and fair frameworks for PPP renegotiations, and (iii) highlight the need for formalized \nPPP processes that maximize transparency and accountability.  \n20  Operations departments have initially identified DMCs for participation in the TA aligned with existing ADB \nprograms/projects including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Nepal, \nUzbekistan and Viet Nam. As part of the process of selecting DMCs for the TA, the Governance Thematic Group \nwill issue a call for subproject proposals to operations departments, with selection based on criteria such as \noperational relevance, links to country partnership strategies, degree of institutional complexity, innovation, gender \nmainstreaming, and learning potential. \n ", "5 \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  30 August 2019\u201331 December 2022 \nExecuting agency  ADB (SDTC-GOV) \nImplementing agency  ADB (SDTC-GOV) \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Individual Selection  International expertise  $254,000 \n(16 person-months) \n  Individual Selection  National expertise (20  $54,000 \nperson-months) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \nADB = Asian Development Bank; SDTC-GOV = Governance Thematic Group; TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n16.
