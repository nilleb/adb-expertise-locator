THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Indonesia for Emergency Assistance for Recovery and Rehabilitation from Recent \nDisasters. \n \n2.  The emergency assistance loan (EAL) aims to mitigate the adverse social and economic \nimpacts of the recent disasters in Lombok and Central Sulawesi. The emergency assistance is \nstructured  to  provided  immediate  and  flexible  financing  for  disaster-related  recovery  and \nrehabilitation expenditures. \n \nII.  THE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE LOAN \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Indonesia is in one of the world\u2019s most disaster-prone regions. The country is exposed to \na  range  of  natural  hazards,  including  flooding,  earthquakes,  landslides,  tsunamis,  volcanic \neruptions, and recently liquefaction.1 Since 1990, Indonesia has experienced an average of 289 \nsignificant disasters per year and an average annual death toll of about 8,000.2 The direct \neconomic cost of disasters is about Rp22.9 trillion annually ($1.8 billion).3 The severity and \nfrequency of these disasters stretch national and local government capacity to respond. \n \n4.  On 28 September 2018, a magnitude 7.4 earthquake struck Central Sulawesi province, \ntriggering cascading catastrophic events. The earthquake led to a near-field tsunami that struck \nthe coast of Central Sulawesi.4 The earthquake and tsunami triggered landslides and caused \nliquefaction of soil in several densely populated districts, reportedly burying entire villages and \ncomplicating relief and recovery efforts. The disasters in Central Sulawesi were preceded by a \ndevastating magnitude 7.0 earthquake in Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara province in August 2018. \n \n5.  Damage reports from the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) on Central \nSulawesi and West Nusa Tenggara identify severe damage to property, infrastructure, and \nlivelihoods. Figure 1 summarizes key indicators for the two disasters. More than 2,600 people \nhave been confirmed dead, 680 people are still missing, and more than 650,000 people have \nbeen displaced. Houses, schools, and health care centers have suffered extensive damage. The \nmovement of people and goods is hampered by damage to hundreds of kilometers of roads, and \nlivelihoods have been hit particularly hard. Field reports suggest that about 29 of the 36-kilometer \nGumbasa irrigation system in Central Sulawesi have been completely destroyed. The coastal \nareas were battered by the tsunami, destroying fishing vessels, ports, and warehouse and cold \nchain facilities. The risk  of  liquefaction  has rendered  much  of  Palu  City  unusable, forcing \ngovernment to explore significant relocation of the city to a new site. BNPB\u2019s initial assessment \nindicated damage and losses of Rp13.8 trillion ($950 million) for Central Sulawesi and Rp18.2 \n                                                \n1  Liquefaction is a process in which sand and silt that is saturated with water loses strength and acts as a fluid when \nshaken by an earthquake (United States Geological Survey. What is Liquefaction?). \n2  Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery. \n3  Government of Indonesia, Ministry of Finance. 2018.

The Humanitarian Country Team comprises United \nNations agencies, international and national nongovernment organizations, and the International Federation of Red \nCross and Red Crescent Societies. \n ", "2 \ntrillion ($1.3 billion) for West Nusa Tenggara, totaling Rp32.0 trillion ($2.2 billion). Of this amount, \nabout Rp24.2 trillion is damage and Rp7.8 trillion is losses.5 \n \n6.  The human cost of disasters is particularly acute for women and girls, who are especially \nvulnerable. While the disasters have harmed large segments of the population, experience from \nother disasters shows that women and girls are likely to be disproportionately affected given \npreexisting gender inequality and discrimination. Women\u2019s chances of survival in disasters are \nreduced by trying to protect the children, elderly, and infirm in their care.6 With displacement and \nthe absence of adequate shelter, women and adolescent girls experience limited privacy and are \nhighly vulnerable to sexual harassment and other forms of gender-based violence. \n \nFigure 1: Disasters, Damage, and Losses \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \n7.  The economic cost to both provinces will rise when losses in output and household \nincomes are included. Growth in Central Sulawesi had accelerated past the national average \nsince 2015 and was expected to reach about 7% in 2018 before the disaster. The consequences \nof the disaster will be most acute for agriculture, fisheries, mining, and quarrying, which jointly \naccount for more than 50% of the province\u2019s economy. While the full economic cost of the disaster \nis difficult to project, initial estimates suggest gross regional domestic product growth will fall to \n3.6% in 2018\u2014cutting growth by half\u2014with the economy recovering to pre-disaster levels only by \n                                                \n5  S.P.

Capital stock is further expected to contract by 7.0% over the same period.7 In West Nusa \nTenggara, weakening export performance slowed growth to 0.1% in 2017. The effects of the \nAugust earthquake are estimated to cut the gross regional domestic product growth rate by 1.6 \npercentage points, with the local economy expected to contract and recover to pre-disaster levels \nonly after 2022. Capital stock is expected to contract by 3.1% in the province. Figure 2 presents \nselected indicators on the impact of the disasters. Initial estimates suggest the potential impact \non the national growth rate to be as high as 0.1% of gross domestic product for 2019, representing \nforgone output of Rp16.2 trillion ($1.1 billion). \n \nFigure 2: Potential Impact on Regional Economic Growth and Poverty Rates \n(annual change) \n15% 18%\ne\npl\no\ne 16%\nwth 10% p(Cree-ndtirsaal sSteurl apwroejseic)ted oor p\ngro 5% of p 14%\nP  e \nGRD p(Wree-dsits Nasutsear  Tpreonjegcgtaerda) ntag 12%\ne\n0% c\nr\ne\nP\n-5%\n2016 2017 2018s 2019s\nCentral Sulawesi West Nusa Tenggara Central Sulawesi West Nusa Tenggara\n \nGRDP = gross regional domestic product. s = simulation. \nSource: Statistics Indonesia; and ADB estimates based on IndoTERM (regional economic model). \n \n8.  The trend of falling poverty incidence in the affected provinces will be reversed. Compared \nwith the national average of 9.8%, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates the share of \npeople below the poverty line is 14.0% in Central Sulawesi and 14.8% in West Nusa Tenggara. \nProvincial averages mask significant disparities, with poverty incidence as high as 32% in North \nLombok. The pre-disaster poverty gap, which measures how far an individual falls below the \npoverty line, is also substantially higher in both provinces than the national average, driven in part \nby the large share of the population that resides in rural areas in Central Sulawesi and high urban \npoverty in West Nusa Tenggara. This large gap suggests that the poor are likely to be pushed \ndeeper into poverty, are more vulnerable to ongoing risks, and will take longer to recover from the \nevents. Initial ADB estimates suggest that poverty incidence will increase to 16.4% in Central \nSulawesi and 16.8% in West Nusa Tenggara in 2018.8 \n \n9.  Job prospects will be significantly reduced by the disasters. Most people in Central \nSulawesi and West Nusa Tenggara rely on agriculture or services in the informal sector to support \ntheir livelihood.9 More than two-thirds of employment is informal, and limited social assistance is \navailable for the jobless adult population. Women\u2019s participation in the labor force is higher than \nthe national average, but one in three is an unpaid worker. Growth in average wages has \nstagnated since 2013, and a considerable gender wage gap exists. Given these conditions, the \n                                                \n7  Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates. \n8  Poverty Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  Statistics Indonesia. 2018. Labor Force Situation in Indonesia: February 2018. Jakarta. \n ", "4 \neffects of the disasters have been particularly damaging to livelihoods. In Central Sulawesi, jobs \nin agriculture, fisheries, and mining have been immediately reduced, driving more workers into \nthe  informal  economy.  Primary  irrigation  channels  have  been  damaged,  with  immediate \nconsequences  for  farmers.  Wide  stretches  of  coastline  have  been  rendered  unusable  for \naquaculture, and marine life will be slow to recover. Damage to maritime ports in Central Sulawesi \nwill constrain trade. In Lombok, the impact of the earthquakes on tourism has had major adverse \neffects on both formally and informally employed people in the sector. \n \n10.  Fiscal adjustments will be required nationally and locally to meet the disaster recovery \nneeds. The economic and social costs of the recent disasters, estimated to exceed Rp40.0 trillion \n($2.8 billion), place significant additional fiscal pressure on the Government of Indonesia. The \nnational government has mobilized immediate resources to aid in the relief and rescue efforts. \nInitial cost estimates from Ministry of Finance suggest an additional Rp4.0 trillion of spending \nbeyond  the  initially  budgeted  resources  of  Rp4.0 trillion  for  2018  and  2019.  The  National \nDevelopment Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) is coordinating the development of short- and \nmedium-term rehabilitation and reconstruction plans for Central Sulawesi and Lombok. Initial \nestimates from BAPPENAS suggest a cost of Rp22.0 trillion for Central Sulawesi and Rp12.0 \ntrillion for Lombok. Furthermore, key agencies, including the ministries of public works and \nhousing,  education  and  culture,  and  transport have  been  instructed  by  the government  to \nreallocate existing allocations under the 2018 budget to provide priority support for affected areas, \nwith  preliminary  estimates  of  Rp1.7  trillion.  Without  additional  financing  resources,  these \nreallocations will reduce planned government investment and services in other parts of the \ncountry as funds are diverted to meet emergency needs. \n \n11.  The additional financing needs have occurred as Indonesia faces significant economic \nuncertainties and surging financing costs. Support from ADB and other development partners will \nbe critical to help the government meet the costs of the recovery and rehabilitation efforts and to \nensure  that  essential  development  spending  on  health,  education,  and  social  protection  is \nmaintained.

Following the earthquake in \nCentral Sulawesi, the governor announced an initial 14-day state of emergency for the province \non 29 September 2018, which was subsequently extended by another 14 days as a more serious \npicture of the damage emerged.10 Coordinated by BNPB, about 11,000 government personnel \nwere  deployed  to  the  affected  areas  to  provide  immediate  rescue,  evacuation,  and  relief \noperations. BAPPENAS is leading the Central Sulawesi Action Plan for Rehabilitation and \nReconstruction (Central Sulawesi Action Plan) in coordination with key agencies such as the \nministries of public works and housing, agrarian affairs and spatial planning, social affairs, and \nenergy  and  mineral  resources.  Because  of  the  complexities  caused  by  liquefaction,  the \ngovernment plans to prepare the Central Sulawesi Action Plan in phases\u2014the plan for recovery \nand rehabilitation will be finalized by the end of 2018 and the reconstruction plan will be finalized \nby  March 2019. The rehabilitation and reconstruction plan for West Nusa Tenggara Barat \n(Lombok Action Plan) has been finalized. Both action plans are based on robust understanding \nof the damage assessment and disaster risk, including gender-differentiated impacts of the \ndisaster and recovery needs. The plans include sections on (i) urban development, housing, and \nsettlement; (ii) infrastructure reconstruction; (iii) social protection; (iv) economic recovery; and  \n(v)  cross-sector  programming.  The  Central  Sulawesi  Action  Plan  also  covers  financing \npartnerships and institutional and regulatory development. \n \n13.  The national and local governments are providing leadership to ensure the effective \ncoordination  of  development  partners.  Humanitarian  partners  have  been  coordinating  their \nresponse  and  recovery  efforts.  Effective  coordination for  emergency  response  is managed \nthrough the establishment of eight clusters, each led by a line agency and a member from the \nHumanitarian Country Team. An early recovery coordination cluster led by BNPB and the United \nNations Development Programme is working together with local government to identify local \nrecovery needs. Development partners, including ADB, the European Union, Japan International \nCooperation Agency, the United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank, have \ncollectively offered support to the government in the assessment process. \n \n14.  In consultation with the government, ADB has put together a comprehensive support \npackage for the disasters, including technical assistance (TA) grants and three channels of \nfinancing support. On 8 October 2018, ADB approved an emergency grant of $3 million from the \nAsia Pacific Disaster Response Fund.11 The grant will support BNPB with immediate relief works \nin Central Sulawesi in compliance with the implementation guidelines of the fund. TA grants of up \nto $3 million from various resources have also been identified and set aside to support the \ngovernment\u2019s post-disaster needs assessment and preparation of an action plan and sector-\nspecific projects for reconstruction (para. 17). In addition to providing grant support, ADB has \nworked with the government to identify three potential channels for financial support. First, the \nEmergency Assistance for Recovery and Rehabilitation for Recent Disasters loan will help the \nnational and local governments meet the near-term requirements in dealing with the aftermath of \nthe disaster, while ensuring that other critical social and development priorities are met. Second, \nADB is preparing an emergency assistance project loan to support reconstruction and relocation \nof  critical  infrastructure,  including  public  facilities  in  affected  areas.  Third,  ADB  and  the \ngovernment are considering reprogramming of existing loans to support reconstruction efforts. \n \n15.  Several  factors  were  considered  when  determining the  appropriate modality  for  the \nemergency assistance (Figure 3). The EAL is a quick-disbursing loan to support the government\u2019s \n                                                \n10 Governor of Central Sulawesi. 2018.

Initial recovery and rehabilitation efforts are likely to be spread across many \nactivities requiring smaller amounts, rather than a small number of investments with large \namounts. As such, providing support that works through the government\u2019s budget system, rather \nthan  directly  financing  individual  activities,  will  be  a  more  efficient  and  effective  response \nmechanism. The loan is aligned with the six characteristics of an EAL as it (i) helps rebuild high-\npriority  physical  assets  and  restore  economic,  social,  and  governance  activities  after \nemergencies;  (ii)  is  designed  to  mitigate  immediate  losses  to  priority  assets,  capacity,  or \nproductivity rather than to provide relief or comprehensive reconstruction; (iii) provides immediate \nshort-term transitional assistance; (iv) is restricted to the transition phase and exclusively for \npriority rehabilitation; (v) is linked with and complements humanitarian relief efforts by other \ndevelopment partners to ease the transition from relief to normal development; and (vi) may \ninclude quick-disbursing components, but is not a policy-based loan.12 \n \nFigure 3: Factors Supporting ADB Response Modality \n \nEmergency (cause)    Fiscal and financial pressure \n(effect) \n \n(i) earthquake, tsunami,  EAR3D (recovery  (i) economic shock  \nliquefaction  and rehab ilitation +  (ii) fiscal pressure from \n(ii) IDPs  Emerg ency  recovery and \n(iii) unemployment  Assistanc e Project  reconstruction spending \n  (iv) social assistance  (reconstruction) +  (iii) spending and \n  eroded  grant and/or TA  investment diverted from \n  (v) damaged infrastructure  other key areas \n \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EAR3D = Emergency Assistance for Recovery and Rehabilitation from Recent \nDisasters, IDP = internally displaced person, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: ADB. \n \n16.  The EAL builds on lessons from past emergency assistance, including the following:  \n(i) providing immediate financing is essential to ensure timely rehabilitation and recovery, thereby \nreducing  the  overall  social  and  economic  impacts  of  a  disaster;  (ii)  coursing  the  financial \nassistance through the government\u2019s budget helps build ownership of the rehabilitation and \nrecovery process; (iii) developing a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework is \ncrucial for the effective implementation of the post-disaster response; (iv) providing TA to develop \nthe rehabilitation and reconstruction plans helps ensure potential implementation challenges are \nidentified early on; and (v) providing TA that helps the government integrate building back better \nand resilience principles ensures that the EAL contributes to the objectives and priorities of ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2016\u20132019 for Indonesia.13 The EAL is consistent with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030, particularly the operational priorities on poverty reduction, gender equality, and \ndisaster resilience.14 \n \n17.  ADB  has  mobilized  TA  resources  to  support  the  government\u2019s  response  planning. \nPlanning and preparation of the Central Sulawesi Action Plan will be supported under the \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2004.

These inputs include gender expertise to identify and design recovery activities that are \ngender responsive and take into account the different post-disaster needs and challenges women \nand girls face. \n \n18.  ADB is also preparing new TA to support the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation \nof the action plans. The TA will help build capacity within the central and local governments, as \nwell as provide additional dedicated resources to support the effective delivery and monitoring of \nrecovery and rehabilitation activities. The new TA will focus on three key areas: (i) developing and \nimplementing  rigorous  monitoring  and  evaluation,  including  coordination  within  and  across \ngovernment agencies; (ii) building capacity for effective financial management, and tracking and \nreporting on disaster recovery and rehabilitation expenditures in line with the action plans; and \n(iii) ensuring that rehabilitation activities are implemented considering the special needs of \nwomen, girls, the elderly, and other vulnerable groups, in line with government regulations. Where \nappropriate, the TA will use civil society organizations and nongovernment organizations to \nprovide monitoring inputs.18 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n19.  The EAL is aligned with the following impact: socioeconomic impact of disaster reduced, \nin line with the national medium-term development plan, 2015\u20132019.19 The EAL will have the \nfollowing outcome: adverse social impact of the recent disasters on the poor mitigated.20 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n20.  The EAL will provide $500 million in immediate support to the government to meet its \nadditional financing requirements linked to new public expenditure under the action plans for \nCentral Sulawesi and Lombok. \n \n21.  Output 1: Funding of the national government expenditure program for 2019 met. \nThe EAL will provide immediate, flexible financing support for the government to efficiently and \neffectively respond to the disasters of 2018. The original projected net financing gap was Rp412.0 \ntrillion for 2018 and Rp88.0 trillion for 2019. However, this gap is expected to increase significantly \nbecause of the Rp40.0 trillion needed for the disasters Indonesia faced in 2018. At the same time, \nthe government is committed to protect the delivery of critical public services across the country. \n \n22.  Output  2:  Government  action  plans  for  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction \nimplemented. The government\u2019s action plans for Central Sulawesi and Lombok will guide the \nrecovery and rehabilitation efforts. Spanning a 2-year period after the disasters, the action plans \ncover short-, medium-, and long-term efforts in five key areas (para. 12). ADB\u2019s emergency \nassistance will focus on immediate recovery and rehabilitation needs in three of these areas: (i) \nurban development, housing and shelter; (ii) social protection; and (iii) economic recovery. For \nthe Central Sulawesi Action Plan, the immediate loss and damage assessment period is October\u2013\nNovember 2018.

The government has requested an EAL of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help fund the financing gap for 2019 arising from additional public spending for the \n2018 disasters and the action plans.21 The EAL will have a 20-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years; a straight-line repayment method; an annual interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London Interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment fee of \n0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based \non this, the average loan maturity is 12.75 years, and no maturity premium applies. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  The EAL will provide immediate mitigation assistance to the government. It will enable \nquick-disbursing support to help ensure that vital recovery and rehabilitation expenditures are met \nwithout compromising other economic and social development expenditures in the national \nbudget. This reflects the urgent need to mitigate the immediate economic and social impacts of \nthe disasters. \n \n25.  The support will flow through government systems to enable a timely response. The \ngovernment faces a significant gap in its disaster financing plan (para. 21). The EAL will enable \nthe government to generate counterpart funds in rupiah equivalent to the loan proceeds. These \nfunds will be used to meet the essential public expenditures related to the disasters, in line with \nthe action plans. The EAL will not directly finance recovery activities. The Board is requested to \nwaive the requirement under the Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy for such quick-\ndisbursing components to finance only a list of identified imports necessary for effective recovery \nassistance.22  EAL  disbursement  and  related  arrangements  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  policies  and \nprocedures applicable to policy-based lending,23 based on a list of ineligible items,24 following \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n26.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency. The proceeds of the EAL will \nbe disbursed upon effectiveness25 and the loan will close by December 2019. Implementation of \nthe emergency response outputs is expected to take 2 years and will be completed by December \n2020. \n \n                                                \n21 Letter of the Minister of Finance of Indonesia to ADB dated 17 October 2018. \n22 Footnote 12, para. 111. \n23 ADB. 1998.

Governance \n \n27.  Governance, transparency, and anticorruption efforts are core government priorities. The \n2017 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment for Indonesia showed that 17 \nof the 31 indicators scored A or B, which are both considered above the basic alignment with \ninternational  good  practice.26  Indicators  with  particularly  good  assessment  results  included \ntransparency  of  public  finance,  and  accounting  and  reporting\u2014all  key  for  the  successful \nimplementation of the action plans. The assessment also identified some areas for improvement, \nincluding the strategic allocation of resources and the efficiency of public spending by linking \nperformance information more effectively to planning and budgeting. The established legal and \nregulatory framework for public financial management was strengthened in 2017 through the \ngovernment regulations mandating coordination between the National Planning Agency and the \nMOF to improve the policy orientation of budgeting. Recent reforms to public procurement \nsystems  have  improved  the  efficiency,  competitiveness,  and  transparency  of  government \nprocurement. ADB supports the government\u2019s governance reform agenda through its Fiscal and \nPublic Expenditure Management Program and Stepping Up Investments for Growth Acceleration \nProgram.27 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government. \n \nB.  Financial Reporting, Auditing, and Monitoring \n \n28.  The EAL is anchored on the government\u2019s action plans for Central Sulawesi and Lombok. \nThe government has allocated an additional Rp2.5 trillion for BNPB beyond the Rp4.0 trillion \ninitially planned in the 2018 budget. In the 2019 budget, the government has allocated Rp15.0 \ntrillion for disaster response. Disbursements of funds from the state treasury will be based on the \naction plans. Depending on the activity, funds will be made available for withdrawal to BNPB and \nrelevant line ministries and agencies. Local treasury offices will undertake necessary internal \ncontrols in coordination with BNPB. The MOF will submit an annual consolidated statement of \nexpenditures under the action plans based on actual disbursements.28 \n \n29.  The government has strengthened its financial management and reporting arrangements \nrelating to disasters. The Audit Board of the Republic of Indonesia conducts annual audits of \nBNPB  and  concerned  line  ministries. The government  will  provide  BNPB\u2019s  annual  audited \nstatement to ADB. Following the 2004 tsunami in Aceh, Indonesia was closely involved in \ndeveloping the international audit standards for disaster-related aid.29 The government intends to \nconduct a special audit of the expenditures for the recent disasters. The Corruption Eradication \nCommission will have oversight on all implementation activities. \n \n                                                \n26 World Bank. 2018.

ISSAI 5520\u2014The Audit of Disaster-Related Aid. \n ", "10 \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  The EAL will help mitigate the adverse social effects of the disaster. Poverty incidence is \nexpected to surge as a result of the economic and social costs of the disasters\u2014from 14.0% to \n16.4% in Central Sulawesi and from 14.8% to 16.8% in Lombok in 2018 (para. 8). The growth of \nregional economies is also expected to slow by 3.6 percentage points in Central Sulawesi and \n1.6% percentage points in Lombok in 2018 (para. 7). The EAL supports priority interventions to \nhelp mitigate these adverse impacts on affected communities. \n \n31.  The EAL is classified effective gender mainstreaming at entry. It aims to ensure that a \ngender  perspective  is  integrated  in  the  government\u2019s  Central  Sulawesi  Action  Plan  for \nRehabilitation  and  Reconstruction30  in  line  with  the  2014  BNPB  regulation  on  Gender \nMainstreaming  in  Disaster  Management,  which  mandates  gender-responsive  planning  and \nbudgeting during the emergency phase and the rehabilitation and reconstruction phase. The EAL \nalso seeks to ensure sufficient resources are allocated to implement gender-specific recovery \ninterventions. The following measures will be implemented to achieve these objectives: \n \n(i)  Consultations to prepare the Central Sulawesi Action Plan will include gender \nstakeholders such as women\u2019s organizations. \n(ii)  The most appropriate disbursement modality of cash grants and benefits for \nhouseholds will be done in close consultation and agreement with women and men \nin affected communities. \n(iii)  The action plan will take into account findings of rapid gender assessment(s) \nconducted after the disaster and will integrate specific interventions to address \nmajor gender issues.31 \n(iv)  The action plan will address the needs of women and girls in terms of sanitation \nand  hygiene,  sexual  and  reproductive  health,  gender-based  violence,  and \nrestoration and improvement of livelihoods.  \n(v)  The action plan will include adequate measures and strategies to strengthen the \npreparedness and resilience of communities to climate change and disasters, and \nwill ensure an active role and voice for women in disaster risk reduction initiatives. \n(vi)  Gender focal points will be established in local offices of the Disaster Management \nAgency in both disaster areas, as mandated by the Gender Mainstreaming in \nDisaster Management regulation. \n \n32.  Gender expertise will be mobilized with TA resources to support this process and build the \ncapacity of the local gender focal point system (paras. 17 and 18). The TA will also support \ninclusive  monitoring  of  the  action  plan  implementation  involving  civil  society  organizations, \nincluding women\u2019s groups and other vulnerable groups. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n33.  The EAL supports the government\u2019s fiscal response by providing quick-disbursing funds \nthrough the government\u2019s budget system. Because the loan proceeds are not earmarked for \nspecific spending or investments, the EAL does not trigger the safeguard policies and is classified \ncategory C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. However, the \n                                                \n30 Emphasis is placed on the Central Sulawesi Action Plan, which is still being developed with ADB support. The \ncompleted Action Plan for Lombok emphasizes ensuring gender perspectives are applied during implementation, \nmonitoring, and evaluation. \n31 The CARE Rapid Gender Analysis is an example of such an assessment (CARE Indonesia. 2018. CARE Rapid \nGender Analysis: Sulawesi Earthquake and Tsunami Indonesia\u2014Version 2. Jakarta). \n ", "11 \nEAL will apply a monitoring and evaluation framework to track government-funded recovery \nactivities, with indicators tracked in the design and monitoring framework (paras. 28 and 29). \n \nE.
