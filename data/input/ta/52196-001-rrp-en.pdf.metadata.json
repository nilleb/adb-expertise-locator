THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nEnergy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), to be guaranteed by India, for the Scaling Up \nDemand-Side Energy Efficiency Sector Project. The report also describes the proposed (i) \nadministration of a loan, and (ii) administration of technical assistance (TA), both to be provided \nby the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), for the Scaling Up Demand-Side Energy Efficiency Sector \nProject, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of the loan and the administration of the TA.1 \n \n2.  The project will be the second Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan to EESL to support \nthe expansion of investments in energy efficiency. The project will follow tested and improved \nnew business models to exploit vast investment opportunities in energy efficiency. Key areas of \nintervention  will  include  (i)  deployment  of  distributed  solar  photovoltaic  systems  in  rural \nagricultural areas, smart meters, and electric vehicles (e-vehicles) with charging stations; and (ii) \nend-user energy-efficiency awareness and capacity development. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  India witnessed strong economic expansion between FY2003 and FY2016, when the \neconomy grew by an average of about 7.2%. Annual carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion \nhave grown even faster, from 0.89 billion tons in 2000 to 1.87 billion tons in 2013 to 2.02 billion tons \nin 2016. 2 The energy mix in India is still largely based on fossil fuels and is dominated by coal even \nthough the country is striving to achieve cumulative 175 gigawatts of renewables by 2022 from about \n80 gigawatts as of August 2019. India\u2019s energy-efficiency potential remains largely untapped, with \npotential annual energy savings of more than 220,000 gigawatt-hours\u2014equivalent to about 17% \nof the country\u2019s total power generated in FY2019.3 \n \n4.  Sector development plan. The Government of India (the government) has recognized the \nneed to achieve more sustainable economic growth while reducing carbon emissions. The Energy \nConservation Act (2001) formalized the government\u2019s strategy to reduce demand for energy \nwithout jeopardizing growth by increasing energy efficiency. The 2010 National Mission for \nEnhanced Energy Efficiency was one of eight national missions by the government under the \nNational Action Plan on Climate Change, launched in 2008. National missions are designed to \nintroduce innovative business models to strengthen the market for energy efficiency products and \nservices.  In April 2015, the government launched the National Electric Mobility Mission Plan 2020 to \nsupport increased usage of e-vehicles. The India National Smart Grid Mission (Phase 2, 2017\u20122020) \nelucidates key objectives and guidelines for reducing system losses, deploying advanced metering \ninfrastructure, promoting energy storage solutions, and increasing e-vehicle usage.  Advance metering \ninfrastructure includes smart meters and communications devices that allow end-users to track \nelectricity  consumption  and  allow  distribution  companies  to  plan  and  improve  billing  and \ncollection efficiency.  \n \n1   CTF is the fund of about $5.4 billion under the Climate Investment Funds established by approval of the International \nBank for Reconstruction and Development executive directors on 1 July 2008 and governed under the CTF \nGovernance Framework.   \n2  International Energy Agency.

World Bank Energy Sector        \nManagement Assistance Program. Washington, DC.  \n \n ", "2 \n5.  In 2015, the government pledged, through its nationally determined contribution to the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to reduce the energy intensity of its \neconomy by 33%\u201335% from 2005 levels by 2030.4 To meet its 2015 pledge, the government must \naddress several barriers. These barriers are (i) on the regulatory side, most distribution utilities \ncontinue to subsidize retail electricity prices, and energy-efficiency programs remain voluntary; \n(ii) at the institutional level, capacity to scale up energy-efficient technologies remains limited; (iii) \non the financial side, the economic benefits of investments, even when quantifiable, cannot be \nreadily monetized and delivered as upfront financing; and (iv) on the consumer awareness side, \nunderstanding of energy-saving technologies and associated benefits remains limited, which in \nturn limits market penetration. \n \n6.  Borrower. EESL, established  as a public sector energy service company (ESCO)5  in \n2009, is a joint venture of four public sector undertakings of the Ministry of Power (MoP): NTPC \nLimited,  Powergrid  Corporation  of  India  Limited,  Power  Finance  Corporation,  and  Rural \nElectrification Corporation.6 As an implementing arm of the Bureau of Energy Efficiency under \nMoP, EESL pursues large-scale energy efficiency focused investments with a comprehensive \nservice package of project design, implementation, monitoring, and investment. ADB approved a \nloan to EESL in 2016 for the Demand Side Energy Efficiency Sector Project, which focuses on \nefficient lighting and appliances, and is being implemented in a satisfactory manner.7 EESL has \nalso successfully implemented several similar projects supported by the German development \ncooperation through KfW, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, and the World Bank. \n \n7.  The approach of Energy Efficiency Services Limited. The company\u2019s overall approach \nis evolving to create a cycle of more innovation, more transparency, and more transformation. It \nadopts low-emission solutions that deliver benefits across all levels: individuals, institutions, \nutilities, and the government. EESL implements rigorous energy audits and technology needs \nassessments, followed up by pilot projects to assess performance and calculate energy savings. \nEESL invests in and implements projects and retains operational responsibility through service \nlevel agreements throughout the project life. Typically, EESL is paid back by the beneficiary over \ntime from the resulting energy savings, thereby addressing the upfront cost barriers that hinder \nsome energy-efficiency projects. Repayment terms are based in part on a deemed savings \napproach.8 Furthermore, EESL regularly invests and partners with other technology developers \nand private sector ESCOs to pilot-test and promote new energy-efficient technologies and \nbusiness models. ADB is administering a grant from the Global Environment Facility to support \nexpansion of EESL\u2019s ESCO business to new energy-efficient technologies.9 \n \n8.  Rationale for sector lending. The sector loan modality allows for implementation of \nsubprojects with high readiness and inclusion of newer subprojects as they are developed, \n \n4  Government of India, Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change. 2015. India\u2019s Intended Nationally \nDetermined Contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. New Delhi. \n5  An ESCO company makes an investment and recovers costs from its clients based on agreed energy-saving \nparameters. Private sector ESCOs have exhibited limited growth because of the reasons outlined in para 5.  \n6  NTPC Limited, formerly known as National Thermal Power Corporation Limited, is an Indian Public Sector \nUndertaking and engaged in the business of electricity generation and allied activities.   \n7  ADB. 2016. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Energy \nEfficiency Services Limited for the Demand Side Energy Efficiency Sector Project in India. Manila. \n8  A deemed savings approach involves upfront estimation of energy savings that will be achieved from the project, \nwhich is agreed by both parties and serves as the basis for annuity payments made during the project life. \n9  ADB is supporting EESL in setting up a revolving fund to pilot-test new technologies and business models through \nAdditional Financing - Demand-Side Energy Efficiency Sector Project of $13 million approved in September 2018. \nEESL is developing a new Global Environment Facility project to promote e-mobility in India with ADB and the UN \nEnvironment Programme as partners. \n \n ", "3 \nirrespective of their physical location. A sector roadmap of the Government of India is available \n(para. 4), and adequate implementation capacity in EESL and states exists (para.  7). Therefore, \nthe sector loan modality is considered appropriate. The loan will also complement support from \nother development partners such as the World Bank, KfW, and others. \n \n9.  Alignment with ADB priorities. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy for India, 2018\u20132022, which aims to boost economic competitiveness to create more and \nbetter jobs; provide inclusive access to infrastructure networks and services; address climate \nchange through renewable energy development, energy efficiency, and development of low-\ncarbon and nonmotorized transit; and increase climate resilience.10 The project will also contribute \nto  meeting  ensuring  access  to  affordable,  reliable,  sustainable  and  modern  energy  for  all \n(Sustainable Development Goal 7). The project is aligned with the following operational priorities \nof ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030:11  \n (i)   addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities  (by  prioritizing \ninvestments  that  provide  more  reliable  electricity  services  to  agricultural \nconsumers);  \n(ii)   tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability (through large-scale investments in distributed clean \nenergy, smart grid, and electric transport services);  \n(iii)   making cities more livable (through investments in electrified transport services);  \n(iv)   accelerating progress in gender equality (by providing training and awareness for \nwomen in the project areas); and  \n(v)   promoting  rural  development  and  food  security  (by  providing  more  reliable \nelectricity services to agricultural consumers). \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: emissions intensity of economy reduced.12 \nThe project will have the following outcome: end-use energy efficiency in the project areas \nincreased.13 \n \n11.  Output 1: Energy-efficient technologies in utility service areas in eligible states \n(including  Andhra  Pradesh,  Assam,  Bihar,  Delhi,  Gujarat,  Jharkhand,  Maharashtra, \nManipur, Meghalaya, Odisha, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, and Uttar \nPradesh) promoted and deployed.14 EESL has successfully created a \u201cnew normal\u201d for more \nefficient lighting, pumping, and buildings. EESL is now expanding its market scope to include \n\u201cupstream\u201d efficiency opportunities that have not been targeted by traditional ESCO investments, \nincluding  smart  meters,  distributed  solar  photovoltaic  systems,  and  e-vehicles.  Installation  of \ndistributed solar photovoltaic systems will reduce network losses, improve power quality in the \nlow-voltage electricity distribution network, and reduce the need for new centralized electricity \ngeneration plants. Deployment of e-vehicles and charging stations will increase overall energy \n \n10 ADB. 2017.

Eligibility criteria \nand selection process are mentioned in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2).  \n ", "4 \nefficiency in transport services while reducing consumption of petroleum fuels and improving \nenergy security. \n \n12.  Output 2: End-user energy-efficiency awareness and capacity increased.  The aim of \nthis output is to create awareness of the benefits of using energy-efficient technologies, and \npersuade people to adopt; and other key stakeholders such as distribution companies to promote \nenergy-efficient measures. EESL\u2019s business is concentrated on the retail end of the energy supply \nchain, and as such is dependent on consumer acceptance of efficiency interventions. Awareness \ncampaigns under this output will engage local organizations in knowledge-sharing and training \nactivities, with a focus on women electricity consumers. Capacity building for electricity distribution \ncompanies, electricity regulatory agencies, and other government agencies is another component \nof this output.   \n \n13.  Core  subprojects.  EESL  and  ADB  have  conducted  due  diligence  of  sample  core \nsubprojects in distributed solar, smart metering, and e-vehicle deployment in Maharashtra and \nAndhra Pradesh.15 EESL will ensure that all subprojects contribute to the sector development plan \n(para. 4). EESL and ADB will appraise, select, and approve subprojects following criteria and \nprocedures outlined in the project administration manual (PAM), to the satisfaction of ADB.16 The \neligibility criteria for sub-projects include: \n(i)  have a detailed project report completed in a format and to a level of detail that are \nacceptable to ADB; \n(ii)  have all counterparty arrangements agreed, including implementation schedules \nand repayment terms; \n(iii)  be scheduled for completion no later than March 2025; \n(iv)  yield a financial internal rate of return exceeding its weighted average cost of \ncapital, with an economic internal rate of return of at least 9%; \n(v)  meet category C of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for environment, \nindigenous people, and involuntary resettlement; and \n(vi)  use no funds from other bilateral and multilateral sources, unless complementary \narrangements  are  clearly  agreed  beforehand,  to  avoid  duplication  and \ndouble counting. \n \n14.  Effective gender mainstreaming approaches will be undertaken for each output to maximize \ngains where appropriate. The project will build on the experience gained since 2016, expanding the \nscope of EESL\u2019s operations to include activities which have not been addressed by the traditional \nESCO business, specifically distributed solar photovoltaic systems, e-vehicles, and smart metering. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n15.  The project will incorporate lessons learned from ADB\u2019s ongoing Demand Side Energy \nEfficiency Sector Project. The loan will help scale up promotion of demand-side energy efficiency \ntechnologies and replicate the successes of and lessons learned from the ongoing ADB project. \nThese include (i) providing sufficient timeline and manpower for EESL to reach agreement and \nimplement subprojects in the eligible states; and (ii) provision for large contract package with \nmultiple smaller lots to address manufacturing constraints while maintaining economy of scale for \ncost reduction and quality assurance. The project will also complement other ADB energy sector \ninvestment  operations,  even  though  most  of  those  are  on  the  supply  side\u2014in  electricity \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution. This will be one of the few ADB projects that specifically \n \n15 Subprojects from other states where ADB operates may also be included, subject to further due diligence and \nacceptance by ADB following its eligibility requirements. \n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nfocuses on demand-side energy efficiency and business models; this model can be scaled up in \nIndia and other ADB developing member countries. EESL continues to investigate opportunities \nto expand its services and create new market opportunities for its new technologies. One way it \ndoes this is through large-scale deployment of new business models such as leasing e-vehicles \nto remove up-front cost barriers to vehicle users. Investments in distributed solar use proven \ntechnologies combined with a relatively new business model for clean energy services. The smart \nmetering component will represent one of the most comprehensive efforts to implement smart \nmetering among ADB developing member countries. The attached TA will support continued \ninvestigation of new opportunities that can be rapidly scaled up and replicated across the region. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n16.  The project is estimated to cost $592 million (Table 1).

Additionally, the TA will support (i) \nproject management consultants (primarily for monitoring and reporting); (ii) technology and \nbusiness model analyses; (iii)  identification and development of remaining subprojects; (iv) \nmapping of candidate sites for e-vehicle charging systems; (v) selective pilot-testing of promising \ntechnologies that can be rapidly deployed at scale; (vi) key elements of the gender action plan; \nand (vii) workshops and seminars.18  \n \n24.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.1 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the CTF and administered by ADB. EESL will provide counterpart support in the form of \ncounterpart staff, office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  The project will adopt advanced proven energy-efficient technologies including grid-\nconnected solar photovoltaic, e-vehicles and charging systems, and smart metering to reduce \nelectricity  network  losses  and  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  distributed  solar \ncomponent  will  generate  electricity  at  distribution  substations  in  rural  areas;  this  will  help \ndistribution companies reduce technical losses and achieve performance targets. Smart metering \nimproves  billing  and  collection  efficiency  and  facilitates  introduction  of  more  efficient  and \ninteractive pricing and demand response options allowing customers and utilities to reduce their \ncosts. E-vehicles reduce overall energy consumption and reduce street-level emissions, providing \ndirect public health benefits. It is expected that the project\u2019s energy savings will total 266 gigawatt-\nhours annually, while greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced by 245,000 tons of carbon \ndioxide (tCO ) annually.19 EESL has confirmed that equipment and systems will be (i) suitable for \n2\nlocal conditions; taking into account issues such as mandated reliability and the quality of the \nelectricity supply; (ii) backed by warranties and maintenance contracts from suppliers, system \n \n18  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 The estimated emissions reductions are from the distributed solar photovoltaic component only to be conservative \nand 19% capacity factor and 0.92 tCO2 per megawatt-hour emission factor are used. \n ", "8 \nintegrators, and service providers; and (iii) serviceable locally. The technical specifications for \nenergy-efficient technologies will comply with national and international standards. Laboratory \ntesting of samples of procured equipment will be undertaken to include both safety and equipment \nlife parameters.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n26.  The project is economically and financially viable.20 Distributed solar subprojects under \noutput 1 will provide clean daytime electricity supply at the point of demand for rural consumers, \nreducing upstream network losses and displacing coal-fired power generation. They will also \nprovide secondary economic benefits via improved power quality, particularly voltage levels. \nEESL wants to spark India\u2019s e-vehicle aspirations by aggregating public sector demand for e-\nvehicles, thereby guaranteeing substantial volumes to allow prospective manufacturers to invest \nin domestic e-vehicle manufacturing facilities. In turn, this will demonstrate that, despite India\u2019s \nheavy reliance on coal-fired generation, e-vehicles can still generate net environmental and \neconomic benefits. Smart metering provides a direct means through which electricity distributors \ncan  address  pervasive  billing  and  collection  inefficiencies  (collectively  termed  \u201ccommercial \nlosses\u201d). Although most of these avoided losses will be converted into sales with no net economic \nbenefit, a significant reduction in wasteful end use of energy (an economic resource cost saving) \nis still expected. The economic internal rates of return for the subprojects are 9.5% for e-vehicles, \n15.7% for distributed solar photovoltaic, and 16.6% for smart meters. Questions remain over the \nexpected life of the e-vehicle batteries. EESL is largely insulated from this risk by way of \nmanufacturers\u2019 performance warranties, but shorter-than-expected battery life still represents a \nrisk to the subproject\u2019s economic performance. \n \n27.  ADB conducted a financial analysis of one sample subproject for each of the subproject \nareas of intervention (distributed solar photovoltaic systems, e-vehicles, and smart meters) being \nfinanced by ADB under output 1. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR), calculated on a real \npost-tax basis (and assuming no reflow of loan proceeds) is 2.70% for the smart meter subproject \nand 3.23% for the e-vehicle subproject\u2014in both cases higher than the weighted average cost of \ncapital of 2.20%. In the case of the distributed solar subproject, which is also cofinanced by the \nCTF loan, the real post-tax FIRR is 1.1% per annum, against a weighted average cost of capital \nof 0.5%. The analysis indicates that the project would generate an even higher FIRR if subsequent \nreflows from the investments are considered. Although the ADB loan is for a 20\u2012year tenor, cost \nrecovery of assets financed under the project (except distributed solar photovoltaic which will earn \nrevenue over 25 years) would range from 6 years to 8 years. Consequently, the tenor of the ADB \nloan is substantially longer than the tenor of the cash reflows that EESL will receive through a \ntransfer of assets. EESL will use such cash flows for similar subprojects until the ADB loan is \nrepaid, which may widen the impact of the project. \n \n28.  EESL\u2019s financial performance during 2017\u20132019 has shown aggressive growth, with \nrevenue increasing from \u20b912.3 billion in FY2017 to \u20b919.4 billion in FY2019, and post-tax profit \nincreasing to \u20b9951 million in FY2019 from \u20b9519 million in FY2017. EESL\u2019s investment plan is \nambitious and will be a challenge from the perspectives of access to investment capital and \ninstitutional capacity. \n \n \n \n \n20 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nC.  Sustainability \n \n29.  All  subprojects  will  be  revenue-generating  and  financially  sustainable.  Rigorous \nsubproject selection criteria will ensure that only financially and economically viable projects are \nselected. The ESCO business model adopted by EESL implies that the annuity is set to recover \nthe full cost of debt, plus a return on equity including income tax. Other costs, like taxes, duties, \nand operation and maintenance (O&M) charges would be billed and recovered periodically at \nactuals.21 Payment is secured by way of escrow accounts, state government guarantee, and/or \nletters of credit. EESL is also continuing its focus on collections. The subprojects are also \ninherently sustainable with respect to environmental and social safeguards criteria (category C) \nand EESL\u2019s implementation capacity. \n \n30.  EESL is exploring various avenues to improve its current financial standing including \nincreasing its equity base, to diversify funding sources to meet its growing financing requirements. \nDepending on the progress, and in due course, ADB may consider further assistance to EESL \nfrom its nonsovereign operations. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n31.  The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is moderate mainly because of \nEESL\u2019s  established  financial  management  systems,  its  experience  with  ADB  procurement \nprocedures,  and  its  satisfactory  progress  on  the  ongoing  Demand-Side  Energy  Efficiency \nSector Project. \n \n32.  Financial  management  assessment.  EESL  has  robust  budgeting  and  accounting \nsystems in place, a finance department staffed by accounting professionals, an integrated \nenterprise resource planning system, and experience implementing ADB-funded projects. The \nassessed pre-mitigation financial management risk arising out of higher volumes of receivables \nfrom its customers in the urban and energy sectors and implementation risk due to EESL\u2019s \nstrategy to diversify its business segments. EESL\u2019s customers are mainly government agencies \nthat face liquidity issues and, consequently, are not prompt with their payments. EESL and state \ngovernments are aware of the situation and are taking measures to address the issue. EESL has \nagreed to significantly reduce its receivables balances to manageable levels within the next 3 \nyears. In addition, the external auditors have issued qualified audit opinions on EESL financial \nstatements for improvements in financial reporting. \n \n33.  ADB has been engaging continuously with EESL to evaluate and improve EESL\u2019s internal \ngovernance, receivables monitoring, and financial reporting. ADB has assessed EESL\u2019s financial \nmanagement action plan and determined that EESL has complied with financial management \nrequirements  by  formulating  and/or  implementing  (i)  a  foreign  exchange  risk  management \nframework, (ii) a framework for protection of project assets, and (iii) a framework for monitoring \npayment security. EESL has also agreed to an ADB requirement to appoint a chief risk officer to \nformulate a risk policy, taking into consideration the business plan of EESL. Under the attached \nTA, a financial management expert will assist EESL in improving financial management. \n \n34.  Project  procurement  risk  assessment.  EESL  has  a  well-developed  procurement \nsystem and a procurement policy that complies with the government\u2019s General Financial Rules, \n2017. Its procurement department is staffed by experienced professionals who have extensive \n \n21 EESL recovers O&M charges, including insurance, on a pass-through basis based on incurred costs, capped at 2%\u2013\n4% of project cost. Any differential between this and actual O&M costs would accrue to EESL. \n ", "10 \nexperience delivering projects of similar size and complexity using open competitive bidding \nprocedures. As per government guidelines, EESL has adopted an e-procurement system that is \ncompliant with the Information Technology Act, 2000 and has been reviewed and is being used \nin ADB projects. Existing information management systems are easily accessed and can provide \ndata  to  support  contract  negotiations,  dispute  resolutions,  and  required  audits.  EESL  is \nimplementing  ADB-funded  project  and  is  familiar  with  ADB  procurement  requirements  and \nprocesses.  ADB  will  also  continue  to  provide  assistance  in  developing  standard  bidding \ndocuments to facilitate the smooth implementation of procurement plans and conduct prior review \nfor procurement packages. The ADB Procurement Policy and Procurement Regulations for ADB \nBorrowers  will  be  used  for  procurement  packages  that  use  ADB  loan  proceeds.  Lowered \nprocurement transaction cost through the use of the borrower\u2019s e-procurement system has also \nbeen considered to achieve value for money under strategic planning process. For procurement \nof goods and services for components of the project that use counterpart funds, EESL will follow \nits existing policies and rules. \n \n35.  ADB conducted integrity due diligence and identified no significant integrity risks.22 ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and EESL. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n36.  The project will contribute to sustainable economic development, poverty reduction, and \nsocial  well-being  through  reduced  electricity  consumption,  reduced  energy  consumption  in \ntransportation services, improved consumer awareness of electricity consumption patterns, and \nimproved access to energy-efficient appliances for consumers. Project beneficiaries will be \nspread across the regions covered by the project and will include agricultural, residential, and \ninstitutional consumers, and electricity distribution companies in selected states in India. People \nwill benefit from (i) economic investment and growth, (ii) improvements in basic infrastructure, \nand (iii) continued community support. A stakeholder communication plan will include end-user \nawareness programs in subproject areas that emphasize women\u2019s participation, gender-sensitive \ntraining, and the adoption and use of energy-efficient technologies. \n \n37.  Gender. The project is categorized as  effective gender mainstreaming. The project \nincludes  affirmative  gender  actions that  will  maximize  benefits  to  women.  EESL  and  ADB \nconducted extensive consultations with stakeholders in preparing a gender action plan with well-\ndefined activities, indicators, targets, and time frames. The gender action plan provides activities \nintegrated within the project design, including (i) training women as commercial drivers, (ii) training \nrural women in energy-efficient technologies to expand their existing businesses or start new \nbusinesses, (iii) end-user energy-efficiency awareness programs with at least  40% women \nparticipation, (iv) report preparation by EESL on good practices in gender mainstreaming in \nenergy-efficiency investments in EESL, and (v) orientation for EESL project staff on gender issues \nand gender mainstreaming practices in the energy sector. EESL will collect, monitor, and report \non sex-disaggregated project data. Toward project completion, EESL will conduct a study (with \nat least 50% women respondents) to assess the benefits of using energy-efficient technologies \nand appliances in the households. The attached TA will finance a gender action plan for the \nproject.23 A gender specialist will be engaged under the attached TA to guide implementation of \nthe project\u2019s gender action plan. \n \n22 ADB. 2003.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.24 \n \n39.  Environment (category C). As required by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) for a \nsector loan, an environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) has been prepared by \nEESL to guide subproject selection, screening and categorization, environmental assessment, and \ninstitutional arrangements. The EARF specifies that only category C subprojects, according to ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009), will be considered for funding. All subprojects will have energy-\nefficient management and technology systems in place that minimize energy losses and reduce \ncarbon dioxide emissions. These interventions will generate some waste, which will be collected, \nstored, transported, and disposed of following the requirements and regulations of the Ministry of \nEnvironment, Forest and Climate Change. EESL and its contractors will adhere to ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) and national environmental, health, and safety regulations in managing any \nwaste that the project may generate. EESL will keep a record of any waste disposed, including \nrelevant permits and/or waste destruction certificates, following the requirements of the Ministry of \nEnvironment, Forest and Climate Change and the central and state pollution control boards. EESL \nwill require its contractors to establish a grievance redress mechanism consistent with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009), and to follow the environment, health, and safety requirements \nof the government as the guarantor, the relevant state, and ADB. EESL will assign staff to the project \nmanagement unit to (i) manage potential environmental issues and compliance with the EARF, and \n(ii)  monitor  the  compliance  of  contractors  and  implementing  partners  with  environmental \nrequirements. \n \n40.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project activities are not expected to cause \nphysical or economic displacement, nor will they require private land acquisition and/or government \nland transfer. Solar photovoltaic systems will be installed on the existing premises of substations \nbelonging to distribution companies and will connect to the existing distribution infrastructure. E-\nvehicle  charging  stations  will  be  located  in  available  public  spaces;  with  EESL  entering  into \nmemorandums of understanding with municipal and/or other public agencies to use such spaces. \nReplacing old meters with new smart meters will require resettlement. The project will have no \nnegative impacts on titled or non-titled holders or their livelihoods. A resettlement framework has been \nprepared by EESL that details involuntary resettlement screening procedures and contains checklists \nfor subproject selection and implementation and to ensure that all future sites for solar infrastructure \nare within existing substation areas and free of encumbrances. It also contains due diligence reports \nof sample subprojects to ensure that the project will not cause negative involuntary resettlement \nimpacts. EESL and ADB conducted stakeholder consultations and documented them in due diligence \nreports, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The loan agreement will \ninclude assurances related to social safeguards, core labor standards for contractors (including equal \npay for equal types of work), and HIV and sexually transmitted disease prevention.  \n \n41.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  activities  will  not  negatively  impact \nindigenous  peoples  or  their  livelihoods.  The  project  outcome\u2014to  increase  end-use  energy \nefficiency\u2014will  produce  positive  socioeconomic  impacts  in  the  project  area.  The  resettlement \nframework (para. 41) includes indigenous people\u2019s checklists, and due diligence reports for the \nsample subprojects to ensure that the project will not negatively impact indigenous peoples.
