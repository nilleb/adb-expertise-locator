THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Second  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Corridor  Towns \nDevelopment Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will support the Government of Cambodia in enhancing the competitiveness \nof the two towns of Kampot and Sihanoukville that are located along the Southern Economic \nCorridor (SEC), one of the three main economic corridors in the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS).2 The project will result in improved urban services in the two towns through wastewater \nmanagement,  solid-waste  management,  and  urban  drainage  upgrading.  The  project  will \nenhance climate resilience and will be in line with the \u201c3Es\u201d of economy, environment, and \nequity as outlined in the Urban Operational Plan of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The six countries of the GMS form a geographically contiguous region and an important \ncluster  of  economic  activity.4 Despite  wide  divergence  in  their  current  level  of  economic \ndevelopment,  the  GMS  countries  are  following  increasingly  similar  urban  development \ntrajectories. Key drivers of urban development and regional integration include the anticipation \nof  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  Economic  Community  in  2015, \nincreased domestic and international migration within the region, the continued economic rise of \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  significant  improvements  in  road  networks  and \nconnectivity, increasingly ubiquitous and improving cellphone and internet coverage, and great \npotential and growing demand for tourism and related activities. The three economic corridors \ndefined under the GMS framework form a network of important routes that connect some of the \nlargest cities in the GMS, including Bangkok, Ha Noi, Ho Chi Minh City, Kunming, Nanning, and \nPhnom Penh.5 \n \n4.  The project, covering Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), and \nViet Nam, represents the second phase of the ongoing GMS Corridor Towns Development \nProject in these countries, which supports urban development along the East\u2013West Economic \nCorridor and the SEC.6 The focus on developing towns along economic corridors aims to \nmaximize  the  benefits  of  increased  trade  and  traffic  flows  so  as  to  strengthen  their \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Second Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor Towns \nDevelopment Project (TA 8425-REG). \n3  ADB. 2013. Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u20122020. Manila. \n4  The GMS countries are Cambodia, the People's Republic of China (specifically Yunnan province and Guangxi \nZhuang Autonomous Region), the Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n5  The three economic corridors are the North\u2013South Economic Corridor, the East\u2013West Economic Corridor, and the \nSouthern Economic Corridor.

The  development  of \nenvironmental infrastructure will promote green growth and improve the climate resilience of \nthese towns in the future. The project supports the first four strategic thrusts of the GMS \nstrategic framework, 2012\u20122022: (i) strengthening infrastructure linkages; (ii) facilitating cross-\nborder  trade,  investment,  and  tourism;  (iii)  enhancing  private  sector  participation  and \ncompetitiveness; and (iv) developing human resources. 7 \n \n5.  Towns along the SEC, which links Thailand with southern Viet Nam through Cambodia, \nand the North\u2013South Economic Corridor, with one branch that links the Lao PDR with the PRC, \nThailand, and Myanmar and another which links Ha Noi to the cities of Kunming and Nanning in \nthe PRC, are well-positioned to serve as dynamic centers of investment and economic growth.8 \nThe strategic location of the corridor towns provides the stimulus for increased trade and \ninvestment. Access to markets will provide incentives for local economies in the hinterlands of \nthe corridor towns. Given these development opportunities, and with the rapid growth of the \nurban population and expansion of these areas, several corridor towns, including Kampot and \nSihanoukville in Cambodia along the SEC, are facing demands for urban infrastructure and \nessential support services. \n \n6.  Kampot is a provincial capital and an agricultural, commercial, service, and regional \ntourism center, with a population of about 35,000 in 2013 and an average population growth \nrate of about 0.5% (compared with the national average of just under 2.0%). Its strategic \nlocation provides excellent road-based connections in the SEC area and to the capital city \nPhnom Penh. The town has significant opportunities for increased economic activities and \ninvestments.  While  tourism  development  is  at  an  early  stage,  visitor  numbers  are  rising \nsignificantly, with tourism potential linked to Kampot\u2019s heritage architecture, proximity to the \nBokor National Park, and a new river port that will offer seaborne access to the outlying holiday \nislands. Currently, there is no reticulated wastewater collection and treatment in Kampot, and \nurban flooding during the wet season is not uncommon as most drainage infrastructure was built \nduring the French colonial times. Solid-waste collection is contracted out to the private sector, \nwith collected waste being disposed of in a poorly managed dump site. \n \n7.  Sihanoukville is a regional center and provincial capital with an expanding economy and \nsignificant levels of urbanization, with an average population growth rate of about 2.5%. With a \npopulation of just over 77,500 in 2013, the city\u2019s recent investment in strategic infrastructure, \nincluding  an  international  port  (Cambodia\u2019s  only  deep-sea  port),  an  airport,  and  a  special \neconomic zone, coupled with a beach environment that has given the town an international \nresort status, has led to an expansion of its services, transport logistics, tourism, and industry \nsectors. More than 85% of the working population is engaged in the services sector, and gross \ndomestic product per capita ($1,345 in 2013) is about 25% higher than the national average. \nHowever, the pace of economic growth has not been matched by investment in essential \nsupporting environmental infrastructure. In particular, environmental degradation means that the \nvisual environment is poor in most places (affecting both the resident environment and water \nquality at the tourist beaches), and poor urban planning and governance has led to urban \nsprawl, scattered developments, and unsustainable land use. Most roadside drains are either \nmissing or in need of repair and most of the town is affected by periodic flooding during the rainy \nseason. Solid-waste collection is contracted out to the private sector, with collected waste being \ndisposed of in a makeshift dump site. \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2011.

", "3 \n \n8.  Lessons  learned.  Key  lessons  learned  from  completed  or  ongoing  ADB-financed \nprojects  in  urban  development,  including  the  first  phase  of  the  GMS  Corridor  Towns \nDevelopment  Project  in  Cambodia,  are  that  (i)  civic  participation  and  demand-driven \ndevelopment activities enhance local ownership; (ii) capacity building requires proper planning, \nadequate targeting, and up-front implementation as it is a long-term effort; (iii) institutional and \npolicy reform should be based on realistic assessments of timing, resource requirements, and \npolitical  will;  (iv)  financial  cost  recovery  is  critical  to  project  sustainability;  (v)  streamlined \napproaches to procurement and contract packaging secures effective project implementation; \nand (vi) strong executing agency leadership and adequate selection of project staff with clearly \ndefined roles and responsibilities are crucial for effective implementation. These lessons are \nclosely aligned to the project, which has a strong capacity development component, optimizes \nthe value of community involvement, and adopts a business plan approach to revenue collection \nand operation and maintenance (O&M). Executing agencies will also receive start-up support on \nADB procedures upon project commencement. \n \n9.  Related policies and strategies. The project is in conformity with government policies \nand strategies, including the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) and other national \npolicies and strategies, including the National Policy on Water Supply and Sanitation.9 The \nproject  is  consistent  with  the  NSDP\u2019s  policy  to  promote  balanced  regional  distribution  of \nstrategically located small and medium-sized towns and the context provided by the Law on \nAdministrative Management of the Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khans.10 \n \n10.  The project is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Cambodia, ADB\u2019s \nUrban Operational Plan, the GrEEEn Cities approach, ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, the GMS \nEconomic Cooperation Program Strategic Framework, the GMS Urban Development Strategic \nFramework 2015\u20132022, and the GMS Regional Investment Framework Implementation Plan \n(2014\u20132018). 11 The  towns  under  this  project  were  prioritized  under  the  GMS  Regional \nInvestment Framework as key towns located along the GMS economic corridors. In addition, as \npart  of  project  preparation,  strategic  local  economic  development  plans  (SLEDPs),  which \npresent the medium-term strategy, planning, and investment plan for each town, have been \nprepared. The SLEDPs are based on technical assessments of potential investments in four \ndimensions (economic development, environment, equity, and good governance), as well as \nextensive stakeholder consultations and discussions. The SLEDPs, which enhance existing \nprovincial master plans and anchor these to the larger regional context of the GMS economic \ncorridors, will be refined and endorsed during project implementation. \n \n                                                \n9  Government of Cambodia, Ministry of Planning. 2014.

The impacts will be aligned with the government\u2019s NSDP, 2014\u20132018 of promoting \ngrowth that is sustainable, inclusive, equitable, and resilient; creating employment, including \nthrough  improving  competitiveness;  promoting  equity  through  reducing  poverty;  improving \nenvironmental sustainability; and promoting efficiency through further strengthening institutional \ncapacity and governance. The outcome will be improved urban services in the two participating \ntowns. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  The outputs of the project are (i) the SLEDPs developed, (ii) priority urban infrastructure \ninvestments  implemented,  (iii)  institutional  capacities  for  managing  public  investments \nstrengthened,  and  (iv)  community  awareness  on  project  activities  and  environmental \nsustainability improved. The infrastructure investments in each town are based on local demand \nand match the priorities of the government. \n \n13.  In Kampot, the project will finance wastewater collection and treatment, solid-waste \nmanagement, and urban drainage. This will include (i) construction of a wastewater treatment \nplant (design capacity 4,500 cubic meters/day) and sewer system (15.6 kilometers [km] of trunk \nmains and 11.4 km of collector mains), including about 2,700 free house connections that will \nserve about 11,000 people (about one third of the town\u2019s population); (ii) construction of 7.9 km \nof separated primary storm water drains in priority urban areas, including the main market and \nsurrounding area; and (iii) closure of the current dump site and construction of a new managed \nlandfill that will service about 3,330 households comprising about 16,000 people (about half of \nthe town\u2019s population). \n \n14.  In Sihanoukville, the project will finance urban drainage and solid-waste management. \nThis will include (i) construction of 64.1 km of separated primary storm water drains in priority \nurban areas, including the town center and surrounding areas; and (ii) rehabilitation of the \nexisting dump site to a managed landfill that will service about 4,770 households comprising \naround 21,950 people (about one quarter of the town\u2019s population). \n \n15.  In addition, the project will finance consultancy services that include implementation \nsupport, detailed design, construction supervision, and project implementation support relating \nto these investments. The consultancy services also include capacity building for refinement of \nthe  SLEDPs,  strengthening  institutional  capacities  for  managing  public  investments,  and \nimproving  community  awareness  on  project  activities  and  environmental  sustainability. \nIncremental project administration costs, including annual audits, will also be financed. \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n22.  The subprojects were selected for the provision of basic environmental services. This \nwill be achieved through improved wastewater management in Kampot and improved solid-\nwaste management and urban drainage upgrading in both towns. The selected projects match \nthe priorities accorded by the government. These investments are technically feasible and use \noptimum design solutions and standards and where the technology for undertaking the civil \nworks and O&M can be managed by the provincial and municipal authorities. Climate resilient \ndesign has been ensured including, for example, through constructing a retaining wall around \nthe wastewater treatment plant in Kampot to provide additional flood protection, and by sizing \nroad  drainage  in  both  Kampot  and  Sihanoukville  to  allow  for  future  rainfall  increases. \nAppropriate levels of capacity building and training are assured in the project loan.  \n \n23.  The project recognizes the weak institutional capacity of the provincial and municipal \nauthorities  to  plan  and  manage  urban  sector  development,  implement  and  operate  urban \ninfrastructure, and deliver essential urban services. This will be addressed through targeted \ntraining and institutional capacity building. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  An economic analysis was undertaken for all of the subproject components to determine \ntheir viability, using the computation of economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as the indicator. \nThe base-case results indicate all components are economically viable with an estimated EIRR \nexceeding the assumed economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The EIRR results range \nfrom 14.5% to 18.1% for Kampot and 13.9% to 14.3% for Sihanoukville. All subprojects were \ngenerally also viable under adverse scenarios in which costs were higher or benefits lower by \n10% than the base case.12 This included a 10% increase in capital cost, 10% increase in O&M, \n10% reduction in benefits, and a 1-year delay in realization of benefits. \n \n                                                \n12 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n \n \n \n ", "8 \n25.  A financial analysis was conducted for both the revenue- and the nonrevenue-generating \nsubprojects  of  each  town  to  confirm  the  sustainability  of  the  investment.  The  analysis \nestablished that, for all towns, sufficient counterpart funds for their investment components will \nbe available. None of the public entities involved in the operation of the respective project \ncomponents such as, for example, sanitation or solid-waste management, is corporatized. They \nare  all  general  government  sector  units  without  separate  accounts.  Therefore,  a  financial \ninternal rate of return has not been calculated. The tariffs collected for the revenue-generating \ncomponents (e.g., sanitation and solid-waste management) currently do not fully cover cost for \nO&M, but will be adjusted over time to meet these requirements. Any funding gap for meeting \nfull O&M cost will be covered by the provincial governments, a commitment that has been \ncovenanted in the loan agreement \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  Assessment shows that the executing agency in Cambodia has experience with the \nfinancial  management  and  fund  disbursement  systems  applicable  to  ADB  projects.  It  has \ndeveloped institutional capacity to undertake international and national competitive bidding for \ncivil works and goods. The project financial management risk is considered high primarily at \nprovincial and city levels. This refers particularly to tariff setting and the allocation of sufficient \nfunding for O&M of urban infrastructure. Capacity development and training assistance will be \nprovided  to  the  PMU  and  PIUs  on  financial  and  procurement  management  and  fund \ndisbursement. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the Government of Cambodia and the MPWT. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (PAM).13 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n27.  From the poverty and social analysis conducted, the project is classified as general \nintervention.14 The overall project social impacts are expected to be positive, with improvements \nto the quality of life for people in both towns. The project will result in improved climate-resilient \ninfrastructure for the participating towns benefitting the full range of social strata, including the \nurban poor and other vulnerable groups in each town. The proposed tariffs for both wastewater \nand solid-waste management have been assessed as affordable for low-income groups. The \nsubproject for improving urban drainage in Kampot and Sihanoukville towns will improve flood \nprotection for the project-affected people, their homes, and their property at a local level. Poor \nand  vulnerable  households  located  in  low-lying  flood-prone  areas  and  who  experience \ninsufficient and/or lack basic environmental sanitation services stand to benefit the most. \n \n28.  The  subprojects  will  create  employment  opportunities  during  construction  and  skills \ncapacity development for local people, especially the poor and vulnerable groups such as \nfemale heads of households or ethnic minorities groups. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial  strategy  includes  measures  to  address  social  impacts  and  enhance  distribution  of \nbenefits resulting from the project. \n \n29.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming. The gender  analysis \nconcluded that women in the subproject areas are at potential risk of not realizing the full \npotential of project benefits and opportunities if gender issues concerning women\u2019s employment \n                                                \n13 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy, and Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). ", "9 \nopportunities and sector representation in decision making are not mainstreamed in project \nactivities. Accordingly, a gender action plan has been prepared aiming at (i) ensuring gender \nissues  are  mainstreamed  in  project  planning  and  implementation;  (ii)  addressing  specific \nimpacts and risks, which may affect women differently or disproportionally compared to men; \nand (iii) enhancing participation of women in project benefits. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  Social  safeguards.  The  safeguard  category  for  involuntary  resettlement  is  B  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). One resettlement plan has been \nprepared for Kampot where land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) impacts are triggered. A \ntotal of 6.1 hectares of land will be acquired affecting 13 households (65 affected people) with a \ntotal of 6 households (30 affected people) severely affected. A total of 19 households (95 \naffected people) will be affected with loss of trees in the solid-waste management site owned by \nthe government. The total LAR cost is estimated to be $1.52 million.15  All affected households \nare entitled to compensation and rehabilitation assistance. Severely affected and vulnerable \nhouseholds will be provided income restoration through cash assistance and skills training, and \nreceive priority for employment in project-related construction works.  \n \n31.  Indigenous peoples. Indigenous peoples safeguards are not triggered by any project \ncomponent in Kampot or Sihanoukville, and the safeguard category for indigenous peoples is C \nin accordance with the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n32.  Environmental safeguards. The project is classified category B for environment in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. One initial environmental examination \n(IEE) report and two environmental management plans (EMPs) (one per town) have been \nprepared.  The  proposed  subprojects  are  not  expected  to  have  irreversible  adverse \nenvironmental  impacts.  Mitigation  measures  for  identified  impacts  related  to  siting,  design, \nconstruction, and operation have been incorporated in the EMPs. In addition, potential impacts of \nclimate  change  and  natural  hazards  (e.g.,  flooding  and  earthquake)  on  the  project  are \nrecommended for integration into the design and engineering stage as part of the IEE assessment \nwhenever feasible and appropriate.16 \n \n33.  Climate change projections and climate change impacts on the project are discussed in \nthe climate vulnerability and risk assessment section of the IEE. Costs that may be attributed to \nclimate change adaptation have been estimated at $1 million for Cambodia, representing about \n2%\u20133% of the ADB loan.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n34.  The integrated benefits and impacts from the project are expected to outweigh the costs. \nThe overall risk is assessed as medium.
