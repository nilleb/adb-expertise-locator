To integrate its Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (CPRGS)1 into \nthe provincial socioeconomic development plans (SEDPs) and to implement its own SEDP,2  \n2006\u20132010, the Government of Viet Nam requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \ntechnical assistance (TA) to help Thua Thien Hu\u00e9 and Quang Tri provinces strengthen their \ncapacity to strategize their poverty reduction and growth programs for faster and sustainable \nsocioeconomic development. The request was pursued by the leaders of the two provinces \nduring the seminar on sustainable regional development strategy conducted jointly by ADB and \nthe Development Strategy Institute of the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) in Hu\u00e9 on \n18 February 2005,3 and echoed during ADB\u2019s Mekong management team retreat on the new \ncountry strategy and program (CSP) for Viet Nam in Hu\u00e9 in late February 2005. A TA fact-\nfinding mission (FFM) was fielded from 8\u201310 April 2005 to discuss the TA design with the \nGovernment  counterparts  and  finalize  the  TA.  The  FFM  discussed  and  reached  an \nunderstanding with the Government on the goal, purpose and outputs, methodology and key \nactivities, cost and financing, implementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference for \nthe TA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Viet Nam\u2019s impressive record of reducing poverty in recent years, particularly halving \npoverty within a decade, is largely attributed to its strong economic growth performance. The \nSEDP commits the Government to maintaining the momentum of growth and further reducing \npoverty by 15\u201318% by 2010. Meeting the needs of the poor below the national poverty line, \nhowever, is perceived as difficult because they live in remote highlands and mountains or in \npockets of inner coastal areas. Similarly, the impressive gains in poverty reduction are still \nfragile and many people, who are just above the poverty line, remain vulnerable to shocks, \nwhich could push them back below the poverty line.5 \n \n3.  A recent joint report6 on the experiences and lessons from Central Highland region notes \nthat, to sustain the current growth and poverty reduction rate, the integration of CPRGS into the \nSEDP is critical for the central and local governments. The report calls for a sharper focus on \nthe provinces to adequately address (i) entrenched poverty; and (ii) local level governance \nissues (including institutional capability for planning, monitoring and service delivery, grassroots \ndemocracy, and social exclusion), gender mainstreaming, and targeted programs for ethnic \nminorities. These issues were similarly echoed in the review reports of ADB TA 4163-VIE and \n                                                 \n1  Viet Nam. 2003. The Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy. For details, see ADB. 2004. Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Socialist Republic of \nViet Nam  for Support to Implementation of Poverty Reduction Program. Manila (Loan 2123-VIE, approved on 9 \nDecember 2004). \n2  The SEDP will include elements of the CPRGS and Viet Nam Development Goals (VDGs). It will be Viet Nam\u2019s \nnational poverty reduction strategy for 2006\u20132010. \n3  A review of policies, progress, and opportunities for sustainable socioeconomic development in the Central \nHighlands, draft report  jointly prepared by Development Strategy Institute and the ADB Viet Nam Resident \nMission, February 2005, Hanoi. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet Edition) on 15 April 2005. \n5  Over 5 years, this group, which was just below the poverty line in 1993, barely moved above the poverty line by \n1998. \n6  CPRGS Steering Committee. 2005. Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy Integration into \nSocioeconomic Development Planning, Lessons from Central Highlands, Vietnam: A Joint Review Report by the \nCPRGS Steering Committee in collaboration  with Asian Development Bank, German Agency for Technical \nCooperation, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, and Provincial Department of Planning and Investment of Central \nHighlands. Viet Nam. \n ", "2   \nTA 4252-VIE,7 which emphasize the need to enhance the capacity of local officials in strategic \nplanning, poverty governance assessment, and investment-needs survey.   \n \n4.  The Government recognizes that, to sustain the high growth and poverty reduction rates, \nit needs to intensify decentralization and devolve more responsibilities to the provinces. The \nSEDP will incorporate elements of the CPRGS and Viet Nam Development Goals (VDGs) to \nstrengthen the quality of socioeconomic plans at all levels through planning reforms. The new \nSEDPs  promote  (i)  \u201cbottom-up\u201d  instead  of  the  traditional  \u201ctop-down\u201d  approaches;  (ii) \nparticipatory approaches, involving representatives from the poor, women, and ethnic minorities; \n(iii) addressing non-income poverty to achieve the VDGs; and (iv) results-based local planning \nand monitoring. Provincial leaders and government officials have voiced that these tasks are \ndifficult due to capacity constraints. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s CSP, which is being aligned to the SEDP, envisages helping the Government \ndevolve  more  responsibilities  to  the  provinces.  The  CSP  will  focus  sharply  on  provincial \ndevelopment  strategy,  policies,  and  programs;  institutional  capabilities;  and  investment \nrequirements, especially along the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) economic corridors such \nas the East\u2013West Economic Corridor (EWEC), which passes through Thua Thien Hu\u00e9 and \nQuang Tri provinces.  \n \n6.  The provinces have identified the following as key development issues: (i) strategic \nplanning capacity for fast and sustainable socioeconomic development is limited, and results-\nbased management is a completely new territory; (ii) understanding and incorporation of the \nCPRGS and VDGs in local socioeconomic planning is limited; (iii) poverty reduction programs \nneed to focus on sandy coastal and remote mountain areas; (iv) physical planning is required to \nlocate  households  and  small  enterprises  in  an  industrial  zone  so  that  new  and  up-scaled \nenterprises will not only create jobs for the poor but also protect the physical environment; (v) \npoverty is related to environmental degradation (e.g., the lagoon in Quang Dien district of Thua \nThien Hu\u00e9; (vi) poverty reduction and growth are regional issues that call for a comprehensive \napproach to promoting synergy among development initiatives in adjoining provinces and along \nthe EWEC; (vii) ethnic minorities must change their behavior to improve their livelihoods; (viii) \nproactive  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  must  be  promoted  to  respond  to \nopportunities  created  by  infrastructure  development;  and  (ix)  effective  local  resource \nmobilization is needed. The SEDP8 will target poverty reduction more intensely than previous \nplans to reach the poor in remote or bypassed locations. The provinces must have the capacity \nto support these initiatives. \n \n7.  Since Viet Nam is among the four countries where ADB is piloting its results-based \nCSPs, and since the SEDP is results-oriented, the proposed TA will be an excellent opportunity \nto introduce the concept and tools of results-based management to the provinces. The lessons \nlearned or results gained from this TA will directly feed into the annual CSP update for Viet Nam \nand preparation of annual provincial plans, as well as assist in the design of interventions in the \nCentral Highlands, EWEC, and southern and northern economic corridors under ADB\u2019s regional \ncooperation strategy and program for the GMS. The outcomes will help form the basis for \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2003.

It will be Viet Nam\u2019s national poverty reduction strategy for 2006\u20132010. \n ", "  3\nrecommending a model to the Government for helping provinces implement decentralization \nand planned reforms. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The  goal  of  the  project  is  to  help  Thua  Thien  Hu\u00e9  and  Quang  Tri  formulate  and \nimplement strategy and programs for faster but sustainable poverty reduction and economic \ngrowth within the SEDP framework. Its purpose is to help the provincial people\u2019s committees \n(PPCs) and the provincial departments of planning and investment (DPIs) (i) conduct a policy \nand institutional analysis of Thua Thien Hu\u00e9 and Quang Tri to identify and address bottlenecks \nin resource flows and service delivery; (ii) implement the SEDP, particularly in preparing annual \nsocioeconomic development plans, taking into account gender and ethnic dimensions, and \nformulating targeted programs for the poor and vulnerable; (iii) conduct sector studies to identify \ninvestible projects, considering opportunities offered by the EWEC  and Lao-Bao economic \nzone, Hu\u00e9 economic zone (under construction), and the deep-water port; (iv) identify project and \nprogram financing alternatives (including from the state, private, and foreign resources); and (v) \ntrain government officials in strategic planning and results-based management.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will be designed and implemented in close consultation with provincial leaders \nand government officials. This process approach will allow provincial leaders and government \nofficials to learn by doing. The major activities and outputs of the TA will be (i) a detailed \nanalysis  of  strengths,  weaknesses,  opportunities,  and  threats  in  the  context  of  fast  but \nsustainable socioeconomic development; (ii) quantitative poverty analysis to identify trends and \ncharacteristics; (iii) introduction of a participatory poverty and governance assessment, based \non  interviews  and  discussions  (report  card)  with  local  people  and  officials  at  selected \ncommunes; (iv) institutional analysis and a study report on selected sectors (e.g., agriculture \ncrop diversification, SMEs); (v) a results-oriented poverty reduction program for Quang Dien \ndistrict in Thua Thien Hu\u00e9, with focus on lagoon environment protection and poverty reduction, \nand for selected communes in mountain districts of Quang Tri, with focus on ethnic minorities; \n(vi) on-the-job training of provincial leaders and government officials and academic institutions \nin concepts and methods in the above analytical studies; and (vii) training modules and seminar \nproceedings on strategic planning and results-based socioeconomic development management. \nThese  activities  and  related  outputs  will  lead  to  high-quality  socioeconomic  development \nplanning and implementation, which will speed up poverty reduction and economic growth in the \nprovinces. \n \n10.  Expected  Development  Results  and  Outcomes.  The  main  expected  results  and \ndeliverables of the TA for Thua Thien Hu\u00e9 and Quang Tri in the short term will include (i) \nadoption of results-oriented and strategic socioeconomic development planning; (ii) adoption of \na participatory process in planning and monitoring of poverty reduction programs; (iii) improved \nrevenue  generation;  (iv)  increase  in  the  number  of  SMEs  and  exports;  and  (iv)  improved \ninstitutional  capabilities  to  undertake  policy  analysis,  sector  studies,  and  results-based \nsocioeconomic  development  management.  In  the  long  term,  the  provinces  will  achieve  (i) \nsignificant  improvement  in  socioeconomic  development  indicators  (income  and  non-income \npoverty, and VDGs in the provinces); and (ii) stronger synergy between provincial and national \nsocioeconomic  development  programs  and  subregional  economic  cooperation  initiatives  to \nincrease economic linkages and to reduce poverty. \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,125,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange cost of $270,000 and a local currency cost of $855,000 equivalent. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $900,000 equivalent, including $270,000 in foreign exchange and \n$630,000 equivalent in local currency. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis, from \nthe Cooperation Fund in Support of the Formulation and Implementation of National Poverty \nReduction Strategies (NPRS). The Government will finance the balance of the local currency \ncosts, amounting to $225,000 equivalent in-kind to cover office accommodation, counterpart \nstaff, administrative and logistic support, and other required services. Details of the TA cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  TA implementation will require (i) 20 person-months of international consultants on an \nintermittent basis, for strategic development planning and results-based management, lagoon \nenvironmental  protection,  poverty  reduction,  crop  diversification,  SME  development,  and \ntraining;  and  (ii)  about  72  person-months  of  domestic  consultants  for  project  coordination, \nstrategic  development  planning  and  results-based  management,  lagoon  environmental \nprotection and poverty reduction, crop diversification, SME development, and training. National \nand  provincial  universities,  research  institutes,  and  nongovernment  organizations  will  be \nconsidered  for  knowledge  partnerships  in  undertaking  some  of  the  envisaged  activities. \nConsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants. \nConsultants  will  be  recruited  as  individuals,  starting  tentatively  from  November  2005  to \nNovember 2007. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The ADB Viet \nNam Resident Mission will administer the TA in close consultation with MPI and with the PPCs \nand DPIs of Thua Thien Hu\u00e9 and Quang Tri. Equipment will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  \n \n13.  The PPCs will be the TA executive agencies, responsible for the overall coordination \nand management of the project, including (i) coordinating with ADB and Government agencies, \nand (ii) ensuring that national approvals are obtained on time. The DPIs will be responsible for \noverall  project  implementation.  The  project  will  be  managed  through  the  provincial  project \nmanagement units (PMUs) to be established within the DPI offices. The team will include \nconsultants and DPI staff members. As the TA covers two provinces, the project steering \ncommittee will provide central coordination. It will be chaired by a director-level official of the \nForeign Economic Relations Department of MPI, and members will include the vice chairs of \nThua  Thien  Hu\u00e9  and  Quang  Tri,  a  deputy  director  of  the  Regional  and  Local  Planning \nDepartment of MPI, selected sectoral provincial departments, the chair of Quang Dien district, \nrepresentatives of research institutes and universities, and ADB. The steering committee will \nmeet semiannually to review implementation progress and guide project activities.   \n \n14.  Evaluation of the direct and indirect benefits on poverty reduction and/or the poor will be \ndone through the periodic reviews of the public investment plans and provincial budgets to \nensure that adequate percentage of investments are targeted at the poor or related activities. \nLikewise, the provincial PMUs will ensure that resource allocation is prioritized and directed at \nfinancing  the  planned  targeted  interventions.  Implementation  progress,  including  impact  on \npoverty or on the lives of the poor, will be circulated to all stakeholders through annual reports. \nADB and the Government will carry out a joint annual review. The consultants will produce (i) an \ninception report, within 2 weeks after the TA starts; (ii) a midterm report, within 12 months; and \n ", "  5\n(iii) a final report at project or assignment completion. The TA is tentatively scheduled to \ncommence in November 2005 and end in November 2007. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 to the Government \nof Viet Nam to be financed on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund in Support of the \nFormulation and Implementation of National Poverty Reduction Strategies for Support to Thua \nThien Hu\u00e9 and Quang Tri Provinces for Sustainable Poverty Reduction and Growth Programs, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms \nImpact       \n       \nSustainable poverty reduction  \u2022 Provincial SEDP more  \u2022 TA review reports \nand economic growth, with  strategically addressed   \nmaximized synergy between  poverty reduction and  \u2022 Provincial annual \nnational and provincial  economic growth issues in  socioeconomic \nsocioeconomic development  terms of effective and  development plans \nprograms and subregional  responded development   \neconomic cooperation  interventions and programs  \u2022 Joint review reports \ninitiatives     (ADB, MPI, and \n\u2022 Significant improvement in  PPCs) \nrevenue mobilization,   \ninvestment, and export \nvolume \n \n\u2022 Achievement of \nsocioeconomic indicators as \nper their SEDP by 2010 and \nMDG and VDGs by 2015 \n \n\u2022 Reduced poverty rate by \n2010 among ethnic minorities \nas compared with 2005 \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n1.
