THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan for the Skills Development for a Modern Economy Project. The project \naims to enhance the country\u2019s competitiveness and boost inclusive growth by improving market-\nrelevant skills development for youth and unemployed job seekers. It will develop a skilled \nworkforce  in  five  priority  trades:  construction,  textiles  and  garments,  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT), agribusiness and food processing, and machinery repair and \nmaintenance. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  Progress  in  strengthening  economic  growth  and  competitiveness.  With  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growing at an average rate of 7.1% from 2004 to 2019,1 the country \ngraduated to lower middle-income status in 2011 and more than halved the poverty rate from \n25.8% in 2005 to 11.4% in 2018. Under significant reforms to trade, tariffs, energy, and exchange \nrates, the World Bank Ease of Doing Business ranking improved from 87th in 2016 to 69th in \n2020. Total foreign direct investment more than tripled from $2.9 billion in 2018 to $9.3 billion in \n2019 and exports increased by 26.2% in the same period. Strong investment growth and higher \nagricultural output and construction activity accelerated real GDP growth in Uzbekistan. \n \n3.  Impediments to improving competitiveness. Skills shortages have been a critical \nconstraint for private sector growth and economic diversification. Thirty-five percent of firms \nreported that employee skills posed a \u201cmajor\u201d or \u201cvery severe\u201d obstacle to growth, and industrial \nenterprises experienced the most difficulty in finding skills (49% reported a lack of qualified \nspecialists).2 Micro and small enterprises (MSEs), concentrated in private sector and the biggest \ncontributor to jobs, suffered from lost business due to lack of suitable skills.3 According to a survey \nof employers, 20% of MSEs reported that they were unable to invest and 23% reported reduced \nbusiness turnover because of a shortage of skills.4 Large companies may organize internal or \ncontracted training for their employees to fill the gap, but MSEs lack the means to do so. \n \n4.  High-growth  economic  sectors.  Some  fast-growing  economic  sectors  have  high \npotential to drive economic growth and create jobs. Food processing, textiles, and garments are \ncompetitive export sectors.5 Construction, a main source of migrant workers, employed 1.24 \nmillion people in January\u2013September 2019 and grew at 11%\u201312% in 2017\u20132019. ICT grew at \nabout 8% yearly in 2013\u20132019 (footnote 1). ICT companies of India and the Republic of Korea \nregard  Uzbekistan  as  a  hub  for  outsourcing  services  from  member  countries  of  the \nCommonwealth of Independent States.6 However, to realize the potential growth of these sectors, \nskilled and semiskilled workers are needed in areas such as quality control, production and \nprocessing, machine operation and repair, programming, and system management. \n \n1  State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Statistics, 2020. \n2  M. Ajwad et al. 2014. The Skills Road: Skills for Employability in Uzbekistan. Washington, DC: World Bank. \n3  Presidential Decree No. 1987 defines MSEs, although the government is proposing a legal definition on medium-\nsized enterprises. In 2017, the public sector contributed 17% of total employment while the private sector 83%; and \nthe MSEs hired 10.5 million people (78%) (State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Statistics, 2019).  \n4 The survey (2018) was supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016.

Socioeconomic consequences of COVID-19. The GDP growth projection for 2020 \ndropped to 0.5% from 5.6% in 2019.7 With the returned migrant workers and the reduced labor \nmigration outflow, the number of migrant workers as of June 2020 was 232,000 lower than in the \nfirst quarter of 2020. The number of unemployed people rose sharply from 1.4 million in 2019 to \n1.9 million by June 2020, resulting in a rise in the unemployment rate from 9.0% to 13.2%; and \none out of five youth (aged 16\u201330) were unemployed during January\u2013June 2020.8 Beyond social \nprotection assistance, labor market interventions are in tremendous demand, including skills \ndevelopment and employment services, especially for youth and unemployed job seekers.  \n \n6.  Employment services. The employment services are yet to meet the needs of employers \nand job seekers. Public employment services (PESs) cover the registration of job vacancies and \njob seekers, career counseling and job matching, and referrals to reskilling services. PES centers \nare located in all regions and have staff working within communities. However, PESs have limited \ncapacity, especially in identifying MSEs\u2019 needs and matching job requirements and job seekers\u2019 \nskills profiles.9 This is partly because PES staff have received limited training (mainly initial job \ninduction and follow-up job reaccreditation), which is not in areas to improve their professional \ncapacity. It is also because incomplete labor market information makes it challenging for the PES \ncenters to perform their duties.10 Quarterly labor force surveys, undertaken by the National \nScientific Center for Employment and Labor Protection (NSCELP) since 2018, largely focus on \nobtaining unemployment data. The main functions of labor market analysis (e.g., skills gap \nestimation) are lacking and cannot inform the planning of training needs.  \n \n7.  Reskilling. Training to reskill workers has increased, but barely meets the needs of the \nsemiskilled and skilled workforce in fast-growing economic trades. Reskilling training has picked \nup since 2017\u2014about 25,000 unemployed people (70% women) in 2018 and 33,000 in 2019 \n(81%  women)  were  trained  with  financing  from  the  State  Employment  Promotion  Fund.11 \nHowever, most reskilling training consists of very short work-based apprenticeships in crafts and \nservice trades. Only 3,900 registered unemployed job seekers (53% women) obtained reskilling \nservices from the six operating professional training centers (PTCs) in 2019. Private training \nservice providers are mostly in areas such as languages and accounting, which do not require \nsignificant capital investment; and private employment service agencies concentrate on migration \nservices, highly paid jobs at profitable enterprises, or jobs that require professional qualifications \nnot found in the labor market.12 \n \n8.  Skills development. The development of skills is in a critical transition. A fixed 3-year, \ncompulsory, free technical and vocational education and training (TVET), equivalent to grades \n10\u201312 for students aged 16 years and above, was provided until 2018.13 However, the approach \nof universal access to TVET did not produce sound labor market outcomes. Only 40.7% of new \n \n7 ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook 2020 Update: Wellness in Worrying Times. Manila. \n8  Government of Uzbekistan, Ministry of Employment and Labor Relations (MOELR), 2020. \n9  The PES centers reported that about 20% of job information came from MSEs. \n10  A labor market information system will be established under the World Bank-financed Strengthening the Social \nProtection System Project (2019\u20132024) in the country. \n11 The State Employment Promotion Fund is administered by the MOELR. One of its mandates is \u201cfinancing of \nexpenses related to the organization of the provision of high-quality vocational training services, and retraining and \nsocial protection of the unemployed people, primarily youth, women and persons with disabilities.\u201d Resolution of the \nCabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 1066. \n12 A. Abdusaidov. 2020. Organizational Mechanism of Interaction between the State and Non-State Employment \nStructures in the Labour Market. Journal of Critical Reviews. 7 (11). pp. 510\u2013514. \n13 By 2017, 1,064,028 students (48.1% girls) or 87.0% of the general education graduates were enrolled in TVET. The \nTVET reform followed the recent expansion of free and compulsory general education from Grade 9 to Grade 11. \n ", " 3 \nTVET graduates were reported to be employed in academic year 2017/18 in their area of \nspecialization.14 Among those employed, 60% were hired below their levels of qualifications, as \nthe skills learned at the technical and vocational educational institutions (TVEIs) were not \nadequate for the expected job performance (footnote 4). The TVET reform, started in 2017, \nsuspended TVEIs from enrolling new students from 2018. In 2019, the number of TVEIs was \ndrastically reduced from 1,423 to 630 alongside the significant reduction of in-service TVET \nteachers.15 TVEIs are resuming enrollment in academic year 2020/21, but are not ready to \norganize relevant and quality skills development because of various constraints. \n \n9.  Relevance and quality of skills development. The TVET system needs to improve \ntraining  quality  and  relevance,  as  it  has  mainly  delivered  training  focused  on  knowledge-\nacquisition rather than competency acquisition. TVET teachers have been divided into theoretical \n\u201cteachers\u201d and practical \u201cmasters,\u201d separating their practical experience from their technical \nknowledge. Teachers have been mostly recruited from fresh university graduates who usually \nhave no industry working experience. Every 3 years, teachers undergo compulsory training to be \nreaccredited, but such training is often too theoretical and does not help upgrade teachers\u2019 \ntechnical and workplace experience. Equipment in TVEIs is mostly outdated and assessment \ndoes not reflect industry practices. The often government-led placement arrangements between \nTVEI graduates and employers are not demand-driven. TVEI training can barely respond to \nmarket needs, as TVEIs are only allowed to deviate a maximum of 15% from the curriculum \ncontent. Career guidance and soft skills training are rarely in place, and entrepreneurship \ndevelopment is preliminary. Lack of effective collaboration or interaction between TVET and \nindustry is also a main constraint behind these issues. The Ministry of Higher and Secondary \nSpecialized Education (MHSSE), which is in charge of the curricula, training materials, and \nteacher development, needs to improve its capacity in collaborating with industry. The TVET \nmonitoring system, under the MHSSE, is fragmented and unable to support evidence-based \ndecision-making. PTCs, formerly as TVEIs, confront the same problems even if they have initiated \nmarket-responsive training and involving industry professionals in teaching and assessment. \n \n10.  Distance learning. Following the impact of the COVID-19, demand for distance learning \nis soaring. Only 45% of the population can access 3G internet, compared with an average of 79% \nin  lower  middle-income  countries.  The  monthly  payment  for  1-gigabyte  mobile-broadband \npostpaid computer-based internet is four times as high as the average for lower middle-income \ncountries.16 Nonetheless, a quick sample survey of the TVEIs and PTCs reveals that (i) about \n70% of colleges have internet access; (ii) teachers in 76% of colleges regularly use digital tools \nduring their lessons, and students in 47% of colleges regularly use digital tools to complete their \nassignments; and (iii) about 95% of teachers and 80% of students use a smartphone.17 Various \ntraining programs have been developed with distance learning materials, but not systematically. \nAn e-learning platform to support interactive learning for different learners is lacking, and feasible \nsolutions to improve distance learning for skills development are needed.  \n \n14 Government of Uzbekistan, Ministry of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education (MHSSE), 2018. \n15 TVET is no longer compulsory following the reform. The TVET system now consists of (i) professional schools under \nthe MHSSE, providing 2-year programs for Grade 9 graduates; (ii) professional colleges under sector line ministries, \nproviding 6- to 24-month programs for Grade 11 graduates; and (iii) technikums (technical colleges), some under the \nMHSSE and some under sector line ministries, providing 2- or 3-year programs for Grade 11 graduates. Given the \npressing need to reskill unemployed job seekers, 30 TVEIs were shifted to the MOELR and will be turned into PTCs. \nOther TVEIs were shifted to general education and higher education. \n16 Uzbekistan is ranked 69th out of 100 countries on The Inclusive Internet Index 2020.

Manila (TA 9727-UZB). \n ", "4 \n11.  Gender and social disparities in labor market outcomes. Although gender equality has \nbeen achieved in enrollment for skills development, most females enroll in courses on pedagogy, \nsewing, and health care that lead to low-paying jobs.18 Female labor market participation is 53.4% \ncompared with 78.0% for men.19 The unemployment rate for women in the first half of 2020 was \n17.4%, up from 11.6% in 2018.20 The concentration of women\u2019s jobs in the service sector partly \naccounted for the rise. Persons with disabilities (PWD) lack access to skills development. The \ngovernment estimated that about 162,000 PWD would be able to work in reasonable facilities with \nsufficient  attention  and support.21 Nevertheless,  in  2019,  only  135 PWD  obtained  reskilling \ntraining organized by PESs and, among them, 33 were trained in PTCs. The lack of PWD-friendly \nfacilities in regular TVET institutions is a key constraint, among others. \n \n12.  Weak sector management and governance. The Ministry of Employment and Labor \nRelations (MOELR) coordinates skills development for employability. However, it lacks evidence-\nbased planning because of its limited institutional capacity in data collection, analysis, and \nreporting. The TVET sector is yet to collaborate closely with industry from the onset of the skills \ndevelopment process because of the lack of trade associations or sector skills councils (SSCs). \nFurther, outdated occupational standards no longer reflect current professions\u2019 requirements. \nAlthough a national qualifications framework (NQF) was published in May 2020, it lacks a \ncomposition of sector qualifications frameworks, so it may not be aligned with industry practice. \n \n13.  Government strategies. Investing in human capital to enable private sector growth and \nimprove the country\u2019s competitiveness is the government\u2019s top priority.22 It plans to implement \nemployment programs to ensure the employment of higher and secondary specialized education \ngraduates, and organize training for workforce development. The TVET sector reform aims to \ndevelop market-relevant skills through institutional changes. The Education Sector Plan, 2019\u2013\n2023 stresses the importance of matching skills development with the demand of employers via \neffective partnership between TVET and industry.23 In 2020, the government aims to increase \nshort-term training and the State Employment Promotion Fund, with aid from the Anti-Crisis Fund, \nto benefit access to job and business development, especially for PWD. The MOELR has \n(i) initiated subsidies for enterprises whose employees were sent for training during the business \ndownturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, (ii) engaged nongovernment organizations to give \nentrepreneurship training to women in disadvantaged areas, and (iii) provided incentives for \ncompanies hiring PWD. These actions are all critical for building a competent and adaptive \nworkforce to achieve competitiveness, diversification, and resilience in an inclusive economy. \n \n14.  Alignment with ADB strategies. The project aligns with the country partnership strategy \nfor Uzbekistan, 2019\u20132023 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) through (i) supporting private \nsector development by preparing skilled workers, and (ii) reducing economic and social disparities \nby reskilling youth and unemployed job seekers.24 It mainly supports four ADB Strategy 2030 \noperational priorities: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities by promoting \nyouth, women, and PWD in developing market-relevant skills; (ii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality by encouraging women\u2019s skills development for nontraditional jobs; (iii) tackling climate \n \n18 The wage gap is 35% between women and men.

Project Description \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: employment level of the population, \nparticularly for youth, increased.26 The project will have the following outcome: market-relevant \nskills learned by students and job seekers.27 \n \n16.  Output 1: Employment and workforce development services improved. This output \nwill improve the access to and quality of training and job placement services for job seekers, with \na special focus on youth and women. At least 48,000 unemployed job seekers will be reskilled at \ncompetency  levels  2\u20133  in  the  priority  trades,  including  agribusiness  and  food  processing, \nconstruction, ICT, textiles and garments, and machinery repair and maintenance (i.e., agro-\nmachines, automobiles, and home appliances), including 500 PWD in relevant fields.28 It will \nsupport  (i)  improving  PES  capacities  for  job  matching  and  referral  to  reskilling  services; \n(ii) updating training equipment for the MOELR\u2019s staff training center, and developing training \nprograms and materials for various training methods, including e-learning; (iii) launching social \nmobilization activities to promote the access to skills development and PESs, especially for youth,  \nwomen in nontraditional areas, and MSEs; (iv) updating 14 selected PTCs by providing advanced \nequipment and upgrading training infrastructure with gender- and PWD-inclusive and energy-\nsaving facilities, including alternative energy provision (solar panels);29 and (v) setting up two \nassessment  centers  meeting  competency-based  training  (CBT)  requirements  with  certified \nmaster assessors.30 This output will adopt the curricula and training materials developed (at \ncertificate level) under output 2, including the essential entrepreneurship training, and facilitate \nthe short-term work-based learning for the trainees. It will also benefit returning migrants who \npursue reskilling or recognition of prior learning in the target domains. \n \n17.  Output 2: Quality and relevance of skills development enhanced. This output will \nimprove the quality and industry relevance of skills development in the priority trades. It is \nestimated  that  at  least  10,000  TVET  students  will  be  enrolled  for  skilling  at  competency                 \nlevels 3\u20134.31 Partnerships with industry will play a critical role in curriculum development, work-\nbased training, and developing and delivering entrepreneurship training.

The TVET management information system will be implemented under the project \nbefore evaluation by the government for any rollout. \n \n18.  Output 3: Sector governance and management strengthened. This output will support  \nthe skills development sector governance by (i) strengthening SSCs and sector skills working \ngroups (SSWGs) for the priority trades to enhance the linkages between industries and skills \ndevelopment systematically; (ii) updating occupational competency standards in targeted areas \nand sector qualification frameworks for the selected trades to improve the applicability, in line with \nindustry practice; (iii) supporting the NSCELP on labor market information monitoring, analysis, \nand reporting, with national skills gap surveys conducted to inform the evolving demand for skills \nand guide the plan for training needs; (iv) strengthening the capacity of the national skills \ncompetition under the WorldSkills standards; and (v) enhancing the capacity for the development \nof distance learning materials in the targeted areas and providing basic personal protection \nproducts at the targeted PTCs and TVEIs to ensure skills development service continuity during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. The SSWGs and SSCs will provide the institutional force to ensure that \nindustry needs are reflected in skills development and lead in any further review for updating the \ntraining programs. To supplement the skills gap surveys, tracer studies will be done for the project-\ninvolved PTC and TVEI graduates to assess their employability and inform in-time responses for \nimproving the quality of skills development. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n19.  ADB has long-standing experience in skills development. Experience and lessons from \nprevious support in the sector and from other projects in the country indicate that (i) to increase \nthe relevance and quality of TVET, companies and industry associations should be involved in all \nsteps, from the definition of competency standards and the development of curricula to the \nprovision  of  training  and  competency  assessment;  (ii)  continuous  tracking  of  graduates\u2019 \nperformance is needed; (iii) the development of e-learning requires strong ownership, long-term \nintervention, and compatibility of policies, infrastructure, and institutional capacity; and (iv) the \ngovernment\u2019s procurement capacity needs solid improvement.33 The project\u2019s key and innovative \nfeatures include (i) a timely response to the COVID-19 pandemic by supporting government \nexpenditure on social assistance and labor market interventions, and complementing other ADB \n \n32 The facilities include advanced equipment, and renovation and reconstruction with gender- and PWD-inclusive and \nenergy-saving infrastructure, including alternative energy provision (solar panels). Three professional schools and \nthree technikums, listed in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2), were selected based on (i) reasonable physical capacity, (ii) experience in the relevant trades, \n(iii) management\u2019s willingness for change, and (iv) even distribution by TVEI types. \n33 Including Independent Evaluation Department. 2008.

The \nproject will complement ADB\u2019s planned financing of the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises \nDevelopment Program in Uzbekistan, which aims to link enterprises with skills.35 It will form \nsynergies on supporting labor market development with the ongoing World Bank-financed project \n(footnote  10).  The  project  will  also  explore  potential  cooperation  in  strengthening  market \nrelevance in skills development in the priority trades with other development partners such as the \nBritish Council and the German development cooperation through KfW.36  \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n20.  The project is estimated to cost $162 million (Table 1).

The government has requested a concessional loan of $93 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an interest rate of 2.0% per year during the grace period and thereafter; and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \n22.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \ngoods including equipment, software, tools, consumables, vehicles, and furniture; consulting and \nnon-consulting services; project implementation and monitoring; and local and overseas trainings. \nThe government will contribute $69 million for (i) renovation and reconstruction of the PTCs and \nTVEIs,  including  the  renewal  of  heating  systems  with  improved  energy  efficiency;  (ii)  tax \nreimbursement  and  exemption  of  duties;  (iii)  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  after  the \nequipment warranty period; (iv) hiring teachers following the teacher recruitment plan, based on \nthe project training needs; and (v) financial charges and other in-kind contributions.

Implementation Arrangements\n24. The MOELR will be the executing agency, responsible for overall coordination and \nmanagement of the project. The first deputy minister of the MOELR will serve as the project \ndirector. The MOELR and the MHSSE will be the implementing agencies. The project will be \nimplemented by two project implementation units (PIUs). PIU 1 will be established under the \nMOELR to support the implementation of project activities related to and/or assigned under the \nMOELR (outputs 1 and 3), and take charge of project coordination. PIU 2 will be established under \nthe MHSSE to support the implementation of project activities related to and/or assigned under \nthe MHSSE (output 2).\n25. A project steering committee, chaired by the MOELR and cochaired by the MHSSE, will \nbe established with representatives from other agencies. The project steering committee is an \ninterministerial consultative body that will be responsible for providing policy or strategic level \ndecision-making for the project, and endorsing the annual project budget plan, including ensuring \nthe timely availability of counterpart financing, and monitoring the resolution of any audit findings.\n26. A project implementation support firm (PISF) will be hired to support the PIUs in project \nimplementation, monitoring, and reporting. Individual financial management and environmental \nsafeguard consultants will also work at the PIUs. The MOELR and MHSSE, under government \nprocedures, will engage the single-contracted authority in charge of civil works under each \nrelevant hokimiyat (regional government) to contract constructors. Design and quality monitoring \nfirms will be hired to (i) develop detailed designs for renovation and reconstruction, and (ii) support \nthe MOELR and MHSSE, respectively, to coordinate with the single-contracted authorities in \nmonitoring and supervising the quality and compliance of the construction process.\n27. Implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the \nPAM (footnote 37).\nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2020\u2013December 2026 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2026 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2027 \nManagement \n(i) Oversight body Project steering committee \nMOELR (chair); MHSSE (co-chair) \nMinistry of Finance; Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade; Ministry of Economic \nDevelopment and Poverty Reduction; Ministry of Agriculture; Ministry of \nConstruction; Ministry for Development of Informational Technologies and \nCommunications; Uzbektextile (Association for Textiles and Garment Industry); \nsector skills councils (members)  ", " 9 \nAspects  Arrangements \nState Inspection for Supervision of Quality in Education (observer) \n(ii)  Executing agency  MOELR \n(iii)  Key implementing  MOELR and MHSSE  \nagencies \n(iv)  Implementation units  PIU 1 under the MOELR, 8 main staff and 5 support staff \nPIU 2 under the MHSSE, 8 main staff and 5 support staff \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding\u2014goods  Multiple contracts  $52,755,000  \n(internationally advertised) \nOpen competitive bidding\u2014goods   Multiple contracts  $5,374,000  \n(nationally advertised) \nRequest for quotations  Multiple contracts  $525,000  \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  1,644 (or TBD) person-months  $9,800,000 \nLeast-cost selection  2 contracts  $285,000 \n  Consultants qualification selection  157 person-months  $855,000 \n  Individual consultants (international  2,583 person-months  $1,810,000 \nand national)     \nNon-consulting services, request  Multiple contracts  $3,020,000 \nfor quotations \nRetroactive financing  No retroactive financing.a Advance contracting is planned for the recruitment of \nand/or advance contracting  (i) PIU staff, (ii) design and quality monitoring firms,  (iii) a project implementation \nsupport firm, and (iv) financial management and environmental safeguards \nindividual consultants.b Advance contracting will be undertaken in conformity with \nthe ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between \nthe government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MHSSE = Ministry of Higher and Secondary Specialized Education, MOELR = \nMinistry of Employment and Labor Relations, PIU = project implementation unit, TBD = to be determined. \na The executing agency decided not to pursue retroactive financing, given the government\u2019s regulation that no \nretroactive financing will be effected before the government\u2019s approval of a project, which follows the approval by the \nADB Board of Directors. \nb Terms of reference were developed for the PIUs, consulting firms, and individual consultants. A national project start-\nup specialist, financed by ADB\u2019s administrative budget, will support the advance contracting process. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n28.  The project is economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of 13.2%. The \neconomic benefits from the project will mainly flow from (i) the increased number of PTC trainees \nand TVET graduates who will be able to secure jobs, and (ii) the increased productivity of the \ntargeted trades where wages will increase. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the economic \nviability of the project is robust to negative scenarios examined, such as increased investment \nand recurrent costs, and benefit reduction. \n  \n29.  The project is financially viable (as it is not for revenue-earning, financial cost\u2013benefit \nevaluation is not relevant). The borrowing is within the fiscal affordability in the sector, based on \nthe projected scale of public expenditures in the TVET and employment policy-related domains. \nThe additional recurrent and capital costs needed for operating the PTCs and TVEIs after project \ncompletion  will  be  low  (a  maximum  of  0.09%  of  government  expenditure  in  2028).  The \ngovernment budget will fund the O&M costs for the project assets after the project period. While \nthe contracts for the procurement of equipment under the project will ensure supplier-provided \npreventive and correct maintenance in the short term, the government\u2019s commitment to ensuring \n ", "10 \nadequate budget allocations for O&M during and after the project will be covenanted in the \nfinancing agreement and monitored during project implementation. \n \nB.  Sustainability \n \n30.  The project design complies with the national building codes and fits the need for energy-\nsaving  facilities  and  alternative  power  provision  by  using  renewable  energy.  The  project-\ndeveloped e-learning platform (with online and offline materials) will support multiple learning \nmethods and meet the increasing demand for distance learning.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n31.  Financial management. The pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial \nmainly because of (i) country governance and public financial management systemic issues, such \nas the weak capacity of public institutions in financial management and in internal and external \naudits; (ii) insufficient financial management capacity of the executing and implementing agencies, \nand the absence of or limited experience in implementing ADB projects; (iii) a need to establish \nnew PIUs and set up a project financial management system, including an ICT accounting system \nin  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies;  and  (iv)  limited  knowledge  of  inventory  and \nequipment management and the potential risk of misuse. The key risk mitigation measures are in \nTable 4. An external audit firm will be hired following the statement of audit needs to ensure timely \nsubmission of audit reports. \n \n32.  Procurement. The procurement capacity assessment concluded that the overall risk \nrating is substantial, mainly because of the low capacity of the implementing agencies. All \nprocurement of goods and recruitment of services will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, \nas amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as \namended from time to time). Value for money will be achieved through the following procurement \narrangements: (i) goods and large non-consulting services will follow open competitive bidding \n(single-stage, one envelope); (ii) the procurement of consulting services will mainly follow quality- \nand cost-based selection; (iii) packages have been arranged by the scope and characteristics of \nthe goods and services, broken into lots, and will be advertised either internationally or nationally, \ndepending on the scope, value, location, and market capacity; and (iv) award will be based on \nthe lowest-evaluated cost per lot or for a combination of lots. A PISF and additional procurement \nstaff will support the PIUs. The key risk mitigation measures are in Table 4. \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  The project is categorized gender equity. It is aimed at improving gender equality in \naccessing skills development and participation in nontraditional jobs. The project will promote the \nenrollment of female students in diploma-level TVET, and the capacity building of female trainers \nin teaching and management positions. The gender action plan includes measures to attract more \nwomen to acquire industry-relevant skills in order to obtain jobs in male-dominated trades. The \nproject will upgrade gender-segregated water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities in the selected \nPTCs and TVEIs; and develop gender-inclusive curricula and training modules.  It will also \naddress PWD\u2019s lack of access to reskilling services. The project will initiate PWD reskilling in one \nof the selected PTCs, ensure PWD-friendly accessibility in the infrastructure, and provide PWD \n ", " 11 \nwith nontraditional training such as ICT. To support understanding of the constraints facing \nindustries in hiring PWD, parallel technical assistance is provided to identify a suitable approach \nto improve the employability of PWD.38  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.39 \n \n36.  Environment (category B). The MOELR prepared an initial environmental examination \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and government environmental regulations. The \nproject will have site-specific environmental impacts related to noise generation, air and water \nquality deterioration, solid waste generation, and community and occupational health and safety \nduring construction. These can be mitigated through the implementation of the environmental \nmanagement plan. The initial environmental examination study was disclosed on the ADB website \non 2 October 2020. The PIUs will submit the environmental monitoring reports regularly. \n \n37.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). A social due diligence report was developed for \nall 20 PTCs and TVEIs. They all have sufficient land area for the planned renovations and/or \nreconstructions, and a well-defined boundary with a wall or fence or both. All renovation and/or \nreconstruction works will occur inside the premises; no one will be affected and no land acquisition \nis required. The proposed works for each project site will be reassessed following the detailed \ndesign before the government\u2019s contract award to contractors, to reconfirm the absence of \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts. \n \n38.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous peoples communities are present in \nthe project sites, as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement for operational purposes. \nTherefore, indigenous peoples safeguards are not triggered for this project. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n39.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.40  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nInadequate staff and  The project will appoint PIU staff with financial and procurement experience under \ninsufficient capacity on  multilateral development bank projects and provide capacity development on \nprocurement and financial  financial management and procurement. An international financial management \nmanagement (including  consultant will be hired to (i) prepare a project financial management manual and \ninternal audit) in executing and  internal audit charter for the PIUs within 3 months from project effectiveness, and \nimplementing agencies  (ii) monitor the setup of the project financial management system. Two national \nfinancial management consultants will be hired to review the quarterly unaudited \nproject  financial  statements  prepared  by  PIU  accountants  and  supporting \ndocuments. International and national procurement experts will be hired (under the \nPISF) to develop a procurement manual, provide capacity building, and support \nthe PIUs in the procurement process. \n \n38 The Proposal for Strengthening the Linkages between Labor Market and Skills Development for Youth and People \nwith Disabilities in Uzbekistan (2020) is supported by ADB. 2017.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n40.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable ADB requirements, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, financial management, and disbursement as described \nin detail in the PAM and loan documents. The government has agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan agreement. The establishment of \neach PIU with the appointment of relevant key staff for initial PIU responsibilities will be conditions \nto loan effectiveness. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n41.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $93,000,000 \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Skills Development for a Modern Economy Project, from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of 2% \nper year during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period \nof 5 years; and such other terms and condition as are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \nPresident \n \n19 November 2020 \n ", "Appendix 1   13 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nEmployment level of the population, particularly for youth, increased (Uzbekistan Action Strategy for Five Priority \n \nAreas)a\nData Sources and \nReporting  Risks and Critical \nResults Chain  Performance Indicators  Mechanisms  Assumptions \nOutcome  By 2027:     \nMarket- a.
