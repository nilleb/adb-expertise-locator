INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  Country  Programming  Confirmation  Mission  for  the  Asian  Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) 2006 program for Viet Nam, the Government of Viet Nam asked ADB for technical \nassistance  (TA)  to  help  prepare  social  and  environmental  aspects  of  the  Phu  My  Bridge \nApproach Roads Project. In the memorandum of understanding for the mission, ADB and the \nGovernment agreed to include two small-scale TAs in the program. During fact finding for these \nTAs, the two sides agreed to consolidate them into a single TA.1 The TA will assist in the \npreparation of resettlement and environmental safeguard documents for the Project, which is \nintended to be part of a larger project to complete the Ho Chi Minh City 2nd Ring Road. A project \npreparatory TA for this larger project is proposed for ADB's 2007 program. A TA fact-finding \nmission visited Viet Nam on 16\u201320 January 2006, and discussed the proposed TA with the \nGovernment.  ADB  and  the  Government  agreed  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  The \ndesign and monitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  One of five strategic priorities of the current Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for \nViet Nam2 is sustainable growth. Under the proposed CSP for 2007\u20132010, ADB will support \ninvestment projects that address critical transport needs constraining economic growth in the \nmain development centers. Ho Chi Minh City is one of the centers that contributes significantly \nto Viet Nam\u2019s economy. As part of the development planning process for Ho Chi Minh City, a \nnumber of master plans have been prepared to address the needs of specific sectors. The city's \nneeds are huge. The transport master plan3 alone identified $14 billion in investment projects for \na program to 2020, as the city's transport systems are inadequate to meet growing demands. \nTo implement the required improvements to transport infrastructure, Ho Chi Minh City must (i) \nbegin priority projects as soon as possible, and (ii) maximize the leverage of the city's funds in \nraising money from other sources.  \n \n3.  The transport master plan identified the completion of the city's 2nd Ring Road as one of \nthe highest priority transport projects. As proposed, financing for this project would include an \nADB loan. However, the Phu My Bridge lies within the missing section of the 2nd Ring Road. \nConstruction on the bridge has started under a concession agreement. However, the approach \nroads to the bridge were not among the facilities to be constructed by the concessionaire. The \nconcession agreement requires that the city complete the construction of the approach roads to \nthe bridge by the end of 2008. Construction of these approach roads will begin in mid-2006. To \nleverage the funds the city is investing in the approach roads, they could be included as a fully \nGovernment-funded component under the project to be funded by ADB. This would require \ncomplying with all ADB policies. As construction work on the bridge is underway, resettlement \nand environmental planning and implementation has started. Planning for the approach roads \nalso has begun. Thus, if ADB requirements are to be met, this work must be reviewed and any \nidentified gaps addressed urgently. The proposed TA will help the Peoples Committee of Ho Chi \nMinh City (PC-HCMC) prepare and implement resettlement and environmental management \nplans that will comply with ADB's safeguard policies. Based on an initial review during TA fact \nfinding, the existing plans appear to meet most of the requirements of ADB safeguard policies. \nProject preparation for the remainder of the missing section of the 2nd Ring Road, including \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 February 2006. \n2  ADB. 2005.

The Study on Urban Transport Master Plan and Feasibility Study in \nHo Chi Minh Metropolitan Area. Ho Chi Minh City. \n ", "2   \nsocial and environmental safeguards, will be undertaken in 2007 under a separate project \npreparatory TA. \n \n4.  Although the Phu My Bridge is a major structure being built within a major city, the \nenvisaged resettlement impacts are not major. On one side of the river, the approach roads will \nbe elevated on a viaduct to avoid major disruption. On the other bank, the alignment passes \nthrough sparsely populated rice fields. No known ethnic minority communities live within the \nproject area, though this will be confirmed during the TA. The construction is not expected to \nimpact any known environmentally sensitive sites. \n \n5.  For  the  Phu  My  Bridge  and  approach  roads,  three  resettlement  plans  have  been \nprepared\u2014one for the bridge, and one each for the western and eastern approach roads. PC-\nHCMC has approved the resettlement plan for the Phu My Bridge (within the concession area), \nand implementation is nearing completion. On the west bank (District 7), 154 households and \nseven commercial enterprises have been relocated. On the east bank (District 2), only land was \nacquired as no structures were affected.  \n \n6.  A resettlement plan has been prepared for the western approach roads, a 3.2 kilometer \n(km) section from the beginning of the elevated section at the foot of the Phu My Bridge to the \nintersection with the Nguyen Van Linh road. This section will require relocation of 113 affected \npersons,  and  clearance  of  14  public  facilities,  1  school,  and  98  households.  Another \nresettlement plan has been prepared for the eastern approach roads, an 8.7 km section from \nthe foot of the Phy My Bridge to the Rach Chiec Bridge. This section will require relocation of \n446 affected persons, and clearance of 130 households and agricultural land of a further 316 \naffected persons. The PC-HCMC is reviewing both of these resettlement plans, which are \nscheduled for implementation during the second and third quarters of 2006. Reviewing and \nimplementation of the resettlement plans will be concurrent with the completion of detailed \ntechnical design and the start of construction work in the third quarter of 2006.   \n \n7.  HCMC University\u2019s Center for Environment and Technology conducted an environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA) for the Phu My Bridge and its approach roads in 2004. The EIA\u2019s \nassessment  of  the  impact  on  the  natural  environment  and  the  socioeconomic  situation  is \nadequately detailed, as are the mitigation measures and monitoring programs. However, cost \nestimates were provided only for the monitoring program. The Ministry of Natural Resources \nand Environment reviewed and commented on the EIA in 2004. PC-HCMC is preparing an EIA \nand an environmental management plan (EMP) for the approach road sections, both of which \nare expected to be completed by March 2006. \n \n8.  The Project is expected to have minor and manageable environmental impacts during \nconstruction and operation. The project area is urbanized, or degraded farmland and fish ponds \nwith little ecological or biodiversity value. At the Phu My Bridge, the Saigon River is heavily \npolluted with few fish or biota, and is used only for transport. Pollution or potential spills into the \nriver from the road or bridge are not expected to have a significant impact on the quality of the \nriver water, even assuming a limited EMP.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  In terms of impacts, the TA will contribute to the successful resettlement of the affected \npersons and adequate protection of the environment during construction of Ho Chi Minh City's \n ", "  3\n2nd Ring Road. The key outcome of the TA will be PC-HCMC\u2019s preparation and implementation \nof a resettlement plan, as well as an EIA that meets ADB policy requirements for the Phu My \nBridge and approach roads. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The outputs for the TA will include the following: \n \n(i)  For resettlement issues, due diligence reports on gap assessment of existing \nresettlement  plans  and  their  implementation,  and  revised  (retrofitted) \nresettlement plans that comply with ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. \n(ii)  For environmental issues, due diligence reports on gap assessment of existing \nEIAs and their implementation, and a revised EIA that complies with ADB's \nEnvironment Policy. \n(iii)  Capacity-building  activities  for  Government  staff  on  resettlement,  and \nenvironmental planning and monitoring. \n11.  The TA will help PC-HCMC implement the revised resettlement plans and the revised \nEIA  to  ensure  that  the  requirements  of  ADB's  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and \nEnvironment Policy are met, and adequate resources are committed to the management of \nresettlement and environmental issues. For Phu My Bridge, the TA will ensure that the quality of \nresettlement and environmental planning and implementation will be known. This will provide a \nbasis  for  discussing  any  shortcomings  with  the  Government,  with  a  view  to  improving \nresettlement and environmental planning and implementation, if necessary. \n \n12.  The TA will cover the dissemination of results. The revised resettlement plans and EIA \nwill be disclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s policies. A public consultation workshop on the EIA \nand EMP will be conducted with people affected by the Project. In addition, this will be an \nopportunity  for  capacity  building  for  PC-HCMC  staff  on  resettlement  and  environmental \nplanning, implementation, and monitoring. Activities under other components of this TA will be \nthe basis for this work. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The  TA  will  cost  an  estimated  $307,500  equivalent.  ADB  will  finance  $230,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government of Viet Nam will \nfinance the remaining $77,500 equivalent through in-kind contributions, including (i) counterpart \nstaff; (ii) office space, office furniture, and facilities for the consultants and counterpart staff; (iii) \nlocal transport and local communications for counterpart staff; and (iv) maps, reports, and other \ninformation.

Links to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to poverty reduction in Viet Nam: \nViet Nam\u2019s impressive economic growth during the 1990s has been strongly pro-poor. With only marginal increases in \ninequality, the proportion of people living in absolute poverty has dropped from 58% in 1993 to 19% in 2004. The \nproportion living below the food poverty line also declined from 25% to 7%, indicating that even the poorest segments \nof the population have benefited from economic growth.  \n \nHo Chi Minh City (HCMC) is at the center of a region that includes (i) the country's largest agricultural area, (ii) a major \ncenter of oil and bauxite production, and (iii) the coastal sections of central and south Viet Nam that have the largest \nreserves of fish and other sea products. HCMC covers 2,029 square kilometer (km2), with the 18 inner urban districts \noccupying 140 km2. While the official population is about 15 million, estimates place the number of unregistered \npersons at more than 1 million. Some 71% of the population is classified as urban, with the remaining 29% as \nsuburban. Average population densities are 2,230 persons per km2, with densities varying from more than 60,000 \npersons per km2 in District 5 to 85 persons per km2 in the District of Can Gio. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per \ncapita in HCMC is approximately twice the national average, or around $873 in 2004. GDP is forecast to grow about \n13% per year. The annual population growth forecast of 3.5% comprises 2% natural increase and 1.5% in-migration. \nFor 2002, the overall poverty rate for HCMC was 2%, while food poverty was 0%. \n \nIn urban areas, the transport sector contributes to poverty reduction as a catalyst for economic growth. With increasing \npopulation growth and economic development, poor or inadequate transport infrastructure constrains economic \ndevelopment through increased transport costs.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nA  poverty  analysis  will  not  be  undertaken  under  the  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA).  However,  a  project \npreparatory TA for the 2nd Ring Road Project has been proposed for the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) 2007 \nprogram. Under this project preparatory TA, a poverty analysis will focus on (i) the impact of improvements to the road \nnetwork in HCMC on social service delivery, (ii) movement of goods and people, and (iii) their impact on poverty. It will \ninclude an assessment of the ability of the poor to benefit from resulting economic activities, as well as a review of \nbarriers that might prevent the poor from benefiting from economic growth. The economic analyses of subprojects and \nextended networks will include individual distributional analysis between stakeholders, including the poor.  \n \n \nC.

Introduction \n1.  The scope of work for the technical assistance (TA) will include: \n(i)  The western approach roads. This section covers approximately 3.2 kilometer \n(km) from the junction at Nguyen Van Linh to the western abutment for the Phu My \nBridge. As proposed, this would be an elevated road, including the ramps and at-\ngrade road connecting to Huynh Tan Phat. \n(ii)  The Phu My Bridge. This section covers approximately 2 km from the western \nabutment of the bridge to a point 600 meters beyond the eastern abutment. \n(iii)  The eastern approach roads. This section covers approximately 8.7 km from the \neastern limit of the bridge (as defined in [ii]) to a point approximately 100 meters to \nthe east of the Rach Chiec Bridge. \n2.  The outputs from the TA for resettlement issues will include (i) due diligence reports on gap \nassessment of existing resettlement plans (RP) and their implementation, (ii) retrofitted RP for the \nPhu My Bridge, (iii) retrofitted RP for the eastern approach roads, and (iv) retrofitted RP for the \nwestern approach roads. \n3.   The outputs from the TA for environmental issues will include (i) due diligence reports on \ngap assessment of existing environmental impact assessments (EIA) and their implementation, (ii) \nretrofitted EIA for the 3.2 km section of Phu My Bridge, and (iii) retrofitted EIA for the eastern and \nwestern approach roads.  \nB.  Terms of Reference \n1.  Resettlement Services  \na.  Detailed Terms of Reference \n4.  The starting point for the resettlement work under the TA will be the RPs prepared by the \nExecuting Agency. The terms of reference for the resettlement services under the TA will include: \n(i)  An RP has been prepared and is being implemented for the 2 km Phu My Bridge \nconcession section of the 2nd Ring Road. The bridge required clearance of 154 \nhouseholds, 7 shops and/or businesses, and agricultural land belonging to a further \n50 households. The consultant will confirm these figures and conduct due diligence \nto (a) identify any gaps between the existing RP and its implementation, and Asian \nDevelopment  Bank's  (ADB)  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  Public \nCommunications Policy; and (b) prepare a retrofitted RP to bring resettlement into \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s policies. \n(ii)  An RP has been prepared for eastern approach roads, an 8.7 km section from the \nfoot  of  the  Phy  My  Bridge  to  the  Rach  Chiec  Bridge.  This  section  will  require \nclearance of 130 households and agricultural land with 316 households. An RP also \nhas been prepared for the western approach roads, a section from the beginning of \nthe elevated section at the foot of the Phu My Bridge to the intersection with the \nNguyen Van Linh road. This section will require clearance of 98 households, 14 \npublic facilities, and 1 school. The Peoples Committee of Ho Chi Minh City (PC-\nHCMC) is reviewing both of these resettlement plans, which are scheduled for \nimplementation  during  the  second  and  third  quarters  of  2006.  Reviewing  and \nimplementation of the resettlement plans will be concurrent with the completion of \ndetailed technical design and the start of construction work in the third quarter of \n2006.  The consultant will conduct due diligence to (a) identify any gaps between the \n ", "10  Appendix 4 \n \nexisting  RPs  and  their  implementation,  and  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement and Public Communications Policy; and (b) prepare retrofitted RPs to \nbring resettlement into compliance with ADB\u2019s policies. \n(iii)  Preparation of the three retrofitted RPs will include a socioeconomic survey and \nsocial and gender analysis, if they have not already been done, as per ADB's Policy \non Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and Policy on Gender and Development (1998). \nThis will entail a review and assessment of the impacts of land acquisition or loss of \nland use on affected persons (in terms of loss of homes, agricultural, and other \nlands; or loss of access to income-generating activities), including impacts caused \nby permanent or temporary acquisition. \n(iv)  Based on the results of the social survey, the TA will confirm whether the Project will \nimpact any ethnic minority communities. \n(v)  Preparation will involve full stakeholder participation, including participation of the \nexecuting and implementing agencies. The retrofitted RPs, which will become the \nproperty of the Executing Agency, must meet ADB\u2019s policy requirements and be \nprepared in full consultation with the executing and implementing agencies. Further, \nthe Executing Agency must confirm that they can be implemented in the context of \nViet Nam. Preparation of the retrofitted RPs shall be based on a full census and \ninventory of lost assets of affected persons and baseline socioeconomic survey of at \nleast a 20% sample of the affected population. A replacement cost study will validate \nwhether compensation rates of all assets are at replacement cost.  The TA will \nassist  the  Executing  Agency  in  disclosing  the  draft  and  final  retrofitted  RPs  to \naffected persons in a form and language easily understood by them, and in an \naccessible place.  \n(vi)  The TA will assess the capacity of responsible institutions at central and provincial \nlevels to plan, manage, implement, finance, and monitor effective land acquisition, \ncompensation, and resettlement; and identify any necessary future capacity-building \nmeasures. \n(vii)  The  TA  will  define  resettlement  planning  and  implementation  arrangements, \ndemonstrate  the  relationship  between  relevant  institutions,  and  indicate  the \nresponsibilities of each unit in a participatory implementation framework. A critical \nreview of the implementation arrangements being used should provide insight to \nimprove the effectiveness of the project implementation structure and personnel. \nThis  will  provide  a  basis  for  recommending  a  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation structure that will allow any subsequent projects to be prepared, \nmanaged, and implemented effectively. \n(viii)  The TA will provide small-scale workshops and other on-the-job training for staff of \nthe project executing and implementing agencies involved in resettlement planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring, as necessary. The objective of the workshops will \nbe to presented the work under the TA to assist in ensuring that the Government \nstaff  have  sufficient  understanding  and  skills  for  resettlement  planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring\u2014not only for the scope of this TA, but for the project \npreparatory TA and other projects involving involuntary resettlement. \n(ix)  The consultant will help the Government implement the retrofitted RPs satisfactorily. \nb.
