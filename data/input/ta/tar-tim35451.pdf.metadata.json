The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is assisting Timor-Leste to rebuild and rehabilitate its \nwater supply and sanitation infrastructure as part of the ADB-managed projects1 funded under the \nTrust Fund for East Timor.2  The current water projects include a capacity-building subcomponent \nthat  provides  support  for  policy,  legislation,  and  regulation  development.    Output  from  this \nsubcomponent is advanced and includes a proposed decree to authorize a very simple and basic \nlevel of water resources management, including assessment and protection of the resource; water \nresource management plans; and a basic form of water licensing system, primarily for urban water \nsupplies. \n \n2.  The need for an integrated natural resource management strategy was first discussed by \nthe transitional administration during the early part of 2002.  Subsequent to independence on 20 \nMay 2002, a request received from the Ministry for Transport, Communications and Public Works \n(MTCPW) (submitted at the Pacific Regional Consultation on Water in Small Island Countries, \nSigatoka, Fiji Islands, 3 August 2002) reconfirmed the need for technical assistance3 (TA) to \nundertake  a  review  of  the  current  status  of  the  country\u2019s  water  resources  and  develop  a \ncomprehensive water resource management strategy and policies to manage these resources. \n \n3.  A Fact-Finding Mission visited Timor-Leste from 5 to 17 October 2002 and confirmed that \ndevelopment of an integrated water resources management (IWRM) system in Timor-Leste will \nbecome increasingly urgent as economic development accelerates.  At the conclusion of the \nmission, during a joint discussion with the representatives of the relevant ministries, the immediate \nneed for such TA was reaffirmed. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  National Water Policy. The May 2002 National Development Plan for East Timor deals \nwith water resources principally in the context of water supply and sanitation. Chapter 13 of the \nPlan,  for  example,  entitled  Natural  Resources  and  Environment,  has  no  mention  of  IWRM.  \nCurrently, a series of water policies are being planned in several ministries.  Significant among \nthese  is  the  water  and  sanitation  policy  contained  in  three  proposed  decrees  approaching \nfinalization by the Water and Sanitation Service (WSS). This policy includes some elements of \nwater resource management.  Also, the Ministry for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) has \nprepared draft terms of reference for a water resource policy study that will focus on agriculture \nand irrigation. The Ministry for Development and Environment (MDE) is preparing legislation on \nenvironmental impact assessment and pollution control, which, inter alia, will cover water quality \nissues and licenses to discharge into water. \n \n5.  While these proposed policies are planned to have some linkage to other national policies, \nthere is no umbrella water resource policy for guidance and to provide overall coordination of the \nsector. The absence of a national policy that specifies the key principles of IWRM to be applied \nacross Timor-Leste, coupled with a lack of water resources management skills and experience, \nposes a very high risk of future incompatible subsector strategies and conflicts over water resource \nallocation as demand for water grows. \n \n6.  Institutional  Arrangements.  During  the  pre-independence  period,  the  concept  of  a \nseparate water resource agency or apex water body or similar mechanism was considered, but not \n                                                           \n1  Grant 8185-ETM(TF): Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project \u2013 Phase I and Grant 8189-ETM(TF): Water \nSupply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project - Phase 2. \n2  ADB is the joint administrator with the World Bank of the Trust Fund for East Timor. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 5 February 2002. ", "2   \naccepted.  Consequently, water resource management functions are currently spread across three \nprincipal ministries,4 with several others having an interest.  \n \n7.  The Water Resources Management Decree (WRMD, referred to in para. 4), currently under \npreparation, is associated with WSS within MTCPW.  This is entirely pragmatic and is based upon \nestablishing  an  initial  regulatory  structure  that  can  be  administered  with  current  civil  service \nresources.  However, this legislation is based on the operational needs of WSS; specifically \nexcludes agricultural use of water, for which separate legislation is planned; and does not include \nmechanisms for solving water allocation disputes between water use subsectors. \n \n8.  Timor-Leste is poorly endowed with water, and competition for this scarce resource is \ninevitable and will be potentially severe as economic development proceeds.  The Constitution \nplaces ownership of water resources with the State.  However, the current absence of a single \n\u201cowner/manager\u201d from at least a global water allocation perspective, and the absence of dispute \nresolution procedures and mechanisms, have the potential to cause future difficulties for existing \nand prospective water users. \n \n9.  Focus of Attention in Water Management. The focus of attention of all current activities is \nrightly on priority rehabilitation of damaged and deteriorated infrastructure, both for water and \nsanitation and for irrigation.  With current water demands depressed because of the state of the \ninfrastructure, among other things, there is little attention at present to matters of water sharing, \nparticularly intersectoral water sharing.  This creates a risk that water development demands will \novertake the administrative capacity to manage them. \n \n10.  This limited attention to the overarching matters of water management is compounded by \nlimited awareness at all levels of IWRM, and by the need to establish more comprehensive water \nresource management skills in the country. Such skills will take many years to establish. \n \n11.  Water Data. Considering the level of destruction of both infrastructure and data that took \nplace during the independence struggle, the available water data in Timor-Leste is insufficient to \nsupport  water  planning  and  water  sharing  policies.    Consequently,  there  is  very  limited \nunderstanding of water resource availability or current and forecast bulk water demands.  In \naddition,  with  defunct  or  non-existent  rainfall,  groundwater,  and  river  flow  monitoring  and \nmeasuring systems, there is no available national system in place to generate the necessary data \nfor planning, including the monitoring of trends arising from changing demands or from factors \nsuch as climate change.  The risks of a poor water resource information base for a relatively dry \ncountry are clear. \n \n12.  Financial and People Constraints. The only government agency with a water resource \nmanagement unit is WSS.  The unit comprises one manager supported by two water quality \nofficers, who operate the WSS water quality laboratory.  The single manager may be adequate to \nservice WSS\u2019s needs as experience and knowledge grows, but cannot hope to do justice to the \nnation\u2019s  water  resources  as  a  whole.    An  ongoing  IWRM  policy  function,  a  surface  and \ngroundwater assessment function, and a water licensing administration function need to be added \nas a minimum in the near future. \n \n13.  Financing and staffing limitations in the civil service mean that establishing the additional \ncapacity needed for IWRM will be slow and challenging.  Consideration of financial constraints \nraises potentially controversial issues of application of resource management service charges \nacross all water use sectors.  This, in turn, is embedded in issues of national water pricing policies.  \n                                                           \n4 The three principal ministries involved are MTCPW, which covers WSS; MAFF; and MDE. ", "  3\nApart from financing additional staff resources, the acquisition of the necessary professional skills \nimplies that some specialist technical and/or tertiary studies will be needed for these staff in the \nfuture. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n14.  The overall purpose of the TA is to create a national water policy that will lead to the \nadoption and progressive implementation of IWRM in Timor-Leste. This is consistent with the major \nthrust of ADB\u2019s water policy. The policy will need to be broad ranging, covering institutional, legal, \nwater assessment, water sharing and allocation, and environmental issues.  Supported by an \nextensive  community  consultation  exercise,  the  policy  will  focus  on  integrating  management \nactivities across government, and will include simple statements of guiding principles for each \nissue, accompanied by broad strategies for subsequent implementation.  In particular, the policy \nwill set the strategic direction for more comprehensive legislation to eventually supersede the \nWRMD, now in its final stages of development.  \n \n15.  To support the policy and to identify areas with water scarcity, a simple assessment of \nwater availability and demand for the nation will be prepared.  This will be supported by a network \nof  inexpensive,  simple  rainfall  gauges  as  a  precursor  to  the  establishment  of  a  national \nmeteorological network and assistance with water resource assessment.  In addition, the TA will \nconstruct up to four basic river gauging stations to reestablish at least elementary trend monitoring \nand to permit improved calibration of hydrological models. The TA will also establish a plan for data \ncollection and an information management system along with the necessary capacity-building \ninitiatives. \n \n16.  The WRMD, developed as a component of the principal legislation for water supply and \nsanitation, empowers WSS to impose conditions on water-use licenses. In the absence of any \nother  formal  body  monitoring  water  use,  it  may  be  appropriate,  as  an  interim  measure,  to \noperationalize this provision in order to achieve a measure of protection of water resources within a \nreasonably short time.  Once the TA has assisted in developing a comprehensive legal framework \nby way of a national water law encompassing cross-sector water use and supported by the \nnecessary capacity-building initiatives, the management role of the nation\u2019s water resources may \nbe shifted to an appropriately authorized regulatory body. \n \n17.  Capacity  development  will  be  a  vital  component  throughout  the  TA  duration.    It  will \ncomprise initial awareness raising at both the political and senior official levels to set the scene for \ninformed national policy development.  This will be followed by specialist seminars on key elements \nof water policy and of IWRM.  Capacity development, including initial awareness raising designed \nto support and sustain IWRM development, will be a key element of the TA. Additionally, both the \nresource assessment and the policy development process will also include needs assessment of \nlocal capacity along with a human resource development plan. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n18.  To  develop  a  draft  national  water  policy  and  supporting  strategy,  the  process  will  be \ninitiated by an awareness-raising exercise for all stakeholders so as to achieve informed and \neffective ownership of the ensuing policy.  In recognition of its national importance, and to ensure \ngovernment ownership, policy development will occur under the guidance of a ministerial-level \nsteering committee.  The process will be guided by experienced international consultants and will ", "4   \nresult in a broad consensus accomplished through a series of facilitated workshops and seminars.  \nParticipants in this process will be senior officers of the civil service and potential user groups.  \n \n19.  Resource  assessment  will  include  research  on  available  data  (including  data  still  in \nIndonesia)  and  the  use  of  hydrological  and  hydrogeological  models  for  estimation  of  water \nresources to reconfirm the limited recorded quantitative information.  International hydrology and \nhydrogeology  specialist  consultants,  working  with  appropriate  local  staff  for  capacity-building \npurposes, will make this assessment. Timing of this activity will be as early as possible in the TA to \nprovide the basis for informed decision-making and policy development.  Gauging stations at sites \nidentified and prepared by the specialist consultants will follow generic designs for construction \nusing local resources and will include a plan for an information management system. \n \n20.  International  consultants,  with  some  support  from  local  facilitators,  will  conduct  both \ncapacity building and awareness raising through development of targeted training and seminar \nprograms.  In addition, the processes of policy development and water resource assessment will \nbe used throughout as case material for training opportunities. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates \n \n21.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $706,000 equivalent, as detailed in Appendix 2. Of \nthis, $544,000 equivalent is the foreign exchange cost and $162,000 equivalent is local currency \ncost. The Government of Timor-Leste has agreed to finance up to a total of $106,000 equivalent of \nthe local currency cost and has requested ADB to finance the full foreign exchange cost and the \nremaining $56,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA amount of $600,000 equivalent \nwill be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The  primary  counterparts  for  this  exercise  are  the  three  ministries  with  key  water \nresponsibilities: MTCPW, MAFF, and MDE.  Together they will provide a ministerial-level steering \ncommittee for the national water policy development process, and provide a joint working group for \nvarious policy elements. \n \n23.  A secretariat representing the ministerial-level steering committee is proposed to act as the \nExecuting  Agency  during  the  implementation  of  the  TA,  assisted  where  necessary  by  the \ninternational consultant/team leader for the TA. The secretariat will be headed by a local officer \nwith skills satisfactory to ADB, This local officer should be available subsequently for attachment to \nany apex body that may emerge from the national policy development process. \n \n24.  Since initially the WRMD prepared by WSS will be used as the monitoring mechanism, \nWSS will be requested to second its water resource management staff for training in water use \nlicensing and in the water assessment processes.  Similarly, WSS will provide the personnel to \nassist in the field operations associated with rainfall gauge and flow gauging station installations to \nbe established within the first 3 months of implementation.  Until a comprehensive operational plan \ncan be established, continued operations of the river gauging stations will be the responsibility of \nWSS, and collecting rainfall data will be shared by district irrigation officers and district agricultural \nofficers from MAFF. \n \n25.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 12 months and will be completed by March \n2004. ADB will play a vital supporting role throughout the implementation period to develop an \neffective IWRM system catering to the evolving needs of the country. Up to five international \nconsultants will provide a total input of 12 person-months beginning in March 2003.  The team of ", "  5\nconsultants will be engaged by ADB from a firm, in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  using  the  simplified  technical  proposal  and  the  quality  and  cost  based  selection \nmethod  along  with  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants.  The consultants will comprise (i) a water policy and water resources management \nspecialist, who will act as principal policy/strategy developer and also as team leader, to be \nrecruited for 6 person-months; (ii) a hydrology specialist to complete the resource assessment and \nto develop a plan for an information management system to process the data from gauging and \nrainfall stations, with an input of 2.5 person-months; (iii) a hydrogeology specialist to complete a \ngroundwater  assessment,  for  an  input  of  1  person-month;  (iv)  an  institutional/environment \nspecialist to guide the review of institutional arrangements, and to assist with the design of new \narrangements with emphasis on integration, for 1.5 person-months; and (v) a water law specialist \nto guide the detailed legislative policy framework, for 1.0 person-month. The outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n26.  Additionally, during the initial stages of the TA, support will be provided by the water \nresources and environment specialist engaged under Phase II of REG-TA 6031.5 This specialist, \nwith  no  cost  implications  for  this  TA,  will  provide  5  person-weeks  of  input,  including  public \nconsultations through community participation workshops. This activity has been included in the \nconsultant\u2019s terms of reference and the team leader of this TA will coordinate his/her participation \nduring implementation. A short-term domestic public participation workshop specialist may also be \nrecruited to assist in the process.  \n \n27.  Procurement of equipment for setting up the gauging stations and other ancillary and office \nequipment will be handled by ADB following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The members of \nthe steering committee, the working group, staff involved in development and management of \nIWRM,  and  representatives  of  various  stakeholders  will  participate  in  training  and  workshops \nundertaken by the consultants.  \n \n28.  Dissemination of the principal output will be in the form of an approval by the Council of \nMinisters of the draft National Water Policy and its subsequent public announcement through the \nnormal channels.  During the implementation period, the consultants will also submit an inception \nreport within 21 days of commencement; regular monthly updates; a midterm report giving the \ninputs and results; a draft final report at least 1 month prior to completion; and a final report upon \ncompletion,  incorporating  the  comments  provided  by  both  ADB  and  the  ministerial  steering \ncommittee, and accompanied by copies of the approved policy documents. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n29.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Timor-Leste for the purpose of Integrated Water Resources Management, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                           \n5  ADB. 2002.

Whatever  records  may  have  been  kept  in  the  country  during  the  Indonesian \nadministration, nearly all have been removed or destroyed.  As a result, to date there is no \nnational appraisal of water availability and demand for all purposes. The resource management \nexercise, therefore, will have to build a picture of available water data by accessing duplicate \nrecords, if possible, as may exist in Indonesia and in Portugal, and at the same time urgently \nreestablish a climatological and rainfall network that will (i) allow changes and trends to be \ndetected, (ii) support water resource assessments, and (iii) provide day-to-day management \ninformation for agriculture.  It can be concluded that the need for a water resource assessment \nprogram is acute. \n \n2.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  require  approximately  12  person-months  of \ninternational consulting services.
