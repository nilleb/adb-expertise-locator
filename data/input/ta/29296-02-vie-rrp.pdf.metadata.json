", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsupplementary loan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Phuoc Hoa Water Resources \nProject.  \n \nII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \nA.  Project Rationale \n2.  The project will construct the Phuoc Hoa barrage and transfer canal to divert water from \nthe Be River to the existing Dau Tieng Reservoir on the Saigon River in the neighboring basin. \nFrom there it will be diverted through the existing Dau Tieng irrigation system for multiple uses.  \n \n3.  The project was prepared in 2003 and an Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan was \napproved in the same year.1 Project implementation was initially deficient. High inflation in Viet \nNam  caused  cost  overruns  and  a  financing  gap  of  $131.6  million  (Table  1).  However, \nimplementation progress improved markedly with the mobilization of project implementation \nconsultants in May 2006 and the transfer of project management to the Hydraulic Project \nInvestment and Construction Management Board No. 9 (ICMB9) in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) in \nNovember 2006. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n4.  The  goal  of  the  project  is  to  contribute  to  sustainable  growth  in  rural,  urban,  and \nindustrial areas of HCMC and surrounding provinces in accordance with the regional master \nplan. The objective of the project is to provide additional water in the Saigon and Vam Co Dong \nriver basins for developing irrigated agriculture and to supplement existing supplies for salinity \ncontrol  and  domestic,  municipal,  and  industrial  (DMI)  use  in  HCMC  and  the  surrounding \nprovinces. The updated design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n5.  The project has two parts. Part A recognizes that successful project implementation \nrequires an integrated approach to develop institutional capacity to sustainably manage the \nsystem  at  all  levels  and  includes  (i)  managing  implementation  and  building  capacity  in \ngovernment organizations to support the sustainable management of project facilities; (ii) the \ntimely completion of on-farm development, support for organizing water users groups, and \nsocial support for groups with special needs; and (iii) the implementation of resettlement plans \nand an environmental management plan to mitigate adverse impacts. Part B will construct the \nPhuoc Hoa barrage and transfer canal. The original scope of the project included developing \nthree new irrigation areas with a combined area of 48,130 hectares (ha): the Binh Long irrigation \nsystem in the provinces of Binh Phuoc and Binh Duong, Tan Bien irrigation system (TBIS) in \nTay Ninh Province, and Duc Hoa irrigation system (DHIS) in Long An Province. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n6.  The project was initially estimated to cost $164.6 million equivalent. It is financed by \nloans from ADB and Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD). The ADB loan is scheduled \nto close on 31 March 2011. AFD loans were approved on 20 November 2003 for \u20ac29.6 million \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

Manila (Loan 2025-VIE, $90 million, approved \non 27 November). ", "2 \n($34 million equivalent), and are scheduled to close on 30 June 2011. The government was \nexpected to finance $35.6 million equivalent in local currency, and beneficiaries to contribute \n$5.0 million in-kind. The actual financing of the initial phase of the project is shown in Table 2.  \n \nD.  Status of and Progress in Project Implementation  \n7.  The  original  arrangements  were  for  the  Central  Project  Office  of  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture and Rural Development (MARD) in Ha Noi to oversee project implementation and be \nresponsible for its management and administration. The Central Project Office was to establish \na project management unit to guide and support existing provincial project management boards \n(PPMBs) in each of the project provinces of Binh Phuoc, Binh Duong, Tay Ninh, and Long An. \n \n8.  Project  implementation  was  initially  slow  and  effectively  commenced  only  with  the \nmobilization  of  project  implementation  consultants  in  May  2006,  almost  2  years  behind \nschedule. The transfer of project management responsibility to ICMB9 further enabled more \nefficient project implementation. In August 2007, MARD assigned to participating provinces \nresponsibility  for  managing  the  design  and  construction  of  downstream  canal  systems, \ndeveloping irrigation subproject areas, and implementing the On-Farm and Social Development \nProgram (OSDP). \n \n9.  By November 2007, halfway through the loan period, implementation progress was still \nvery low, at 11%. For the ADB loan, cumulative contract awards were only 12.1% of the loan \namount and disbursements were 6.4%. For the AFD loans, there were still no contract awards \nor disbursements. An ADB review mission at that time identified significant capital cost overruns \ncaused by rapidly escalating costs for labor, materials, and supplies, which was exacerbated by \ncontinuing delays in awarding construction contracts. Land acquisition and resettlement costs \nalso substantially increased. \n \n10.  A joint ADB and AFD midterm review mission in May 2008 concluded that the project \ncould not achieve its main objectives without supplementary financing. It was agreed that the \nremaining funds would be used to complete infrastructure for the basin transfer component and \nfor related institutional development. With this focus, the project would be able achieve its \npurpose of only providing additional water for DMI and salinity control in the Saigon River basin. \nThis was considered phase 1 of the project. \n \n11.  At the request of Binh Duong and Binh Phuoc provincial people\u2019s committees, the Binh \nLong irrigation scheme was cancelled, as the project areas were being converted for industrial \nand residential use or to grow rubber, which does not require irrigation. Phase 2 of the project \nwould therefore comprise preparing and implementing irrigation development in Tay Ninh and \nLong An provinces. It was subsequently agreed, in November 2008, that resettlement and \nconstruction for the Tan Bien main canal would proceed with phase 1 funding.2 The design of \nirrigation systems commenced in May 2009 for Tan Bien and May 2010 for Duc Hoa, with \nOSDP  consultants  facilitating  farmer  consultation  during  design,  assisting  resettlement \npreparation, and helping plan agricultural and social support.  \n \n12.  All basin transfer activities and Tan Bien main canal construction are expected to be \ncompleted on schedule by the end of March 2011. Basic designs were completed in July 2010 \nto provide the layout and cost estimates for phase 2. After MARD approves basic designs, \n                                                 \n2  The agreement was based on assurances from MARD on counterpart funding, associated capital investments \nbeing completed, resettlement preparation being carried out, and the anticipated economic viability of the TBIS. \n ", "3 \ndetailed  designs  will  be  completed.  The  designs  for  the  TBIS  exclude  substantial  rubber \nplantations that will not need irrigation. Designs for the DHIS are flexible to accommodate \npossible changes in land use from traditional wetland rice to high-value agricultural crops. \n \n13.  OSDP  consultants  contracted  to  help  form  water  users  groups,  design  agricultural \nsupport programs, assist with resettlement planning and support to affected people, and monitor \nresettlement implementation initially performed poorly. Progress with OSDP implementation has \nimproved as staff members have been replaced with those who are full-time and fully committed \nto the OSDP objectives. Project implementation consultants provide guidance and support \ncapacity building. \n \n14.  A total of 2,183 households (including 305 ethnic minority households) with 9,500 people  \nare affected by ongoing construction in phase 1 and covered by 11 resettlement plans approved \nby ADB. Four resettlement sites have been established to accommodate people (including \nethnic minorities) wishing to relocate. The implementation of resettlement and compensation \nhas complied acceptably with the resettlement framework and resettlement plans. External \nresettlement is being monitored, with PPMBs addressing any grievances. \n \n15.  An  ADB  safeguard  review  mission  in  March  2008  noted  considerable  progress  in \nachieving environmental targets at a rate commensurate with the needs of the project. Some \nenvironmental safeguard measures that were delayed but have since been completed include \nADB\u2019s  approval  of  the  revised  environmental  management  plan  and  the  approval  of  the \nenvironmental impact assessment by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment in \nMarch 2008. The buffer zone management program that aims to protect natural habitats in Lo \nGo Xa Mat National Park and production forest reserves in Tay Ninh Province will commence \nimplementation in phase 2. \n \n16.  Project implementation consultants have provided effective management and technical \nsupport to ICMB9 and PPMBs. They have supported the project task force in irrigation system \nmanagement  and  guided  OSDP  and  environmental  monitoring  consultants.  PPMBs  have \ngenerally been active in shouldering their management responsibilities despite limited staff \nresources  and  capacity  and,  initially,  a  lack of  experience  with  the social  requirements  of \nresettlement or the concept of participatory irrigation management (PIM).    \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Cost Overrun \n17.  As described in paras 25 and 26 below, increased costs have caused a funding gap of \n$131.6 million that will require supplementary funding from ADB, AFD and the government. \nIncreased costs can be attributed to several factors, including higher inflation than was initially \nassumed  in  cost  estimates,  implementation  delays  compounding  inflation,  and  some \nunderestimation of unit rates and quantities for construction in the original feasibility study.3  \n \nB.  Impact on the Project \n18.  The impact and outcome of the project have not changed.4 The outputs have been \nupdated  to  achieve  the  outcome  and  contribute  to  the  impact.  These  outputs  are  (i) \n                                                 \n3 Analysis of Cost Overruns (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4 The original \"goal\" is now the \"impact\" and the original \"objective\" is now the \"outcome\". \n ", "4 \nstrengthened  capacity  of  water  related  organizations  in  the  Phuoc  Hoa  area;  (ii)  on-farm \nirrigation systems developed and intensified agricultural practices adopted; (iii) project affected \nhouseholds fully resettled and compensated; (iv) environmental management plan successfully \nimplemented; (v) basin transfer facilities operating, and irrigation and DMI water supplied; and \n(vi) irrigation facilities constructed and operating.  \n \n19.  Major developments in water resource management and irrigation since 2000 are (i) the \ntransfer of responsibility for state management of water resources to the Ministry of Natural \nResources and Environment, which separates state management and service functions for \nwater resources that were formerly MARD\u2019s responsibility; (ii) responsibility for managing on-\nfarm  irrigation  systems  being  assigned  to  water  users;  (iii)  and  the  promotion  of  PIM  to \nstrengthen  the  role  of  water  users  in  designing  and  operating  irrigation  systems.  These \nimportant developments, particularly those that decentralize irrigation system management, are \naccommodated  in  the  original  project  design,  which  emphasizes  creating  institutional \narrangements  for  farmer-based  irrigation  management  and  building  capacity  in  irrigation \nmanagement  companies  (IMCs)  and  farmer  organizations  to  operate  and  maintain  project \nirrigation systems. These activities will be further supported during phase 2. \n \n20.  Part A of the project substantially invested in sustainable systems management, which is \nalready building capacity in organizations responsible for managing the basin transfer system \nthat will supply water for irrigation, DMI uses, and salinity control, as well as in IMCs to operate \nproject-funded irrigation systems. A task force created by MARD to guide the development of \nmanagement objectives for the combined Dau Tieng\u2013Phuoc Hoa water resource management \nsystem has approved an action plan for sustainable systems management, which is under \nimplementation. The training and capacity building plan is being implemented with support from \nproject implementation consultants, and the formulation of operational management plans and \nmaintenance and asset management plans for IMCs is already well advanced. \n \n21.  A PIM approach to irrigation design and operation strengthens water users\u2019 ownership \nand commitment to take responsibility for on-farm irrigation management and the capacity of \nIMCs to efficiently and responsively manage irrigation systems. Support for PIM is incorporated \ninto the OSDP and will be strengthened during phase 2 by a senior PIM adviser to the ICMB9, \nproject steering committee (PSC), task force, and provincial governments. Ongoing capacity \nbuilding  for  operating  the  basin  transfer  system  and  project-funded  irrigation  systems  will \naddress the management needs for water resource infrastructure established under the project.  \n \nC.  Rationale  \n22.  The proposed supplementary financing complies with ADB\u2019s criteria, as (i) it will ensure \nthe  successful  completion  of  an  ADB-financed  project  with  cost  overruns;  (ii)  the  project \ncontinues to be a priority in the government\u2019s development strategy; (iii) it will help achieve the \noriginal project objectives and benefits; (iv) the project has satisfactory implementation progress \nand appears likely to attain its development objectives; (v) the project is in an advanced stage of \nimplementation, enabling the ADB-funded components to be completed within 3 years; and (vi) \nthe cofinancier, AFD, will finance a substantial part of the cost overrun through an additional \nloan  to  be  processed  in  parallel  with  ADB\u2019s  supplementary  financing.  The  government \nrequested ADB and AFD to provide supplementary financing to complete the project and ensure \nachievement  of  its  original  objectives.  The  ADB  supplementary  loan  was  confirmed  in \nconsultations with government and is reflected in the country operations business plan.5 \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2008. Country Operations Business Plan: Viet Nam, 2009\u20132011. Manila. \n ", "5 \n \n23.  Without supplementary financing, the project would not achieve its original objectives to \ndevelop irrigation in the TBIS and the DHIS on 20,545 ha. Further, without constructing the Duc \nHoa main canal, the project would not reliably supply water to existing irrigation systems in Tay \nNinh Province (2,657 ha not related to the TBIS) or HCMC (900 ha in Cu Chi district), or the \nplanned 4 cubic meters (m3)/second of DMI water to Long An Province. The Tan Bien main \ncanal would remain underutilized, supplying only DMI water to Tay Ninh Province. Ongoing \ndesign work for the Duc Hoa main canal, TBIS, DHIS, and OSDP programs would be wasted. \n \nD.  Revised Cost Estimates \n24.  Along  with  actual  expenditure,  the  total  funding  required  to  complete  phase  1  is \nestimated at $174.6 million. Phase 2 expenditure is estimated at $154.9 million. Total project \nexpenditure to complete both phases 1 and 2 is estimated at $329.5 million.6  \n \nTable 1: Consolidated Total Project Costa \n($ million) \nActual and  Estimated \nOriginal Cost  Estimated  Phase 2  Total \nItem    Estimates  Phase 1 Costsb  Costs   Costsc \nA.

Phase 2 physical \ncontingencies are computed at 10.0% for all expenditure categories. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nE.  Revised Financing Plan \n25.  Not all the approved funding has been utilized; the balance of the original ADB loan, \nestimated to be $23.3 million, is available for phase 2 construction. Supplementary financing \nestimated at $131.6 million, including taxes and duties of $8.4 million, is required to complete \nthe project. The government has requested a loan of $60.0 million from ADB Special Funds \nresources and additional cofinancing of \u20ac20 million ($25.0 million equivalent) from AFD to \nsupplement the loans from ADB and AFD that were agreed in 2003. The ADB supplementary \nloan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest rate of 1% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the initial loan agreement, as amended for \nsupplementary financing. Interest charges on the loan will be capitalized. The AFD loan will be \nprovided as parallel collaborative cofinancing. Subject to negotiations, the AFD loan will be as \nconcessionary as possible, with an interest rate subject to change every 6 months, a long term, \nand  a  long  grace  period.  Interest  charges  on  the  AFD  loan  will  not  be  capitalized.  The \ngovernment\u2019s supplementary financing is $42.9 million, including local taxes and duties. Farmer \nbeneficiaries will contribute $3.7 million in services provided in kind.  \n                                                 \n6  Detailed Cost Estimates (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nOriginal  Actual  Supplementary  Total  Share of \nSource  Financing  Financing  Financingb  Financing  Total (%)c \nAsian Development Bank  90.0  95.0a  60.0  155.0  47.0 \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement  34.0  36.0a  25.0  61.0  18.5 \nFarmer beneficiaries    5.0  0.0  3.7  3.7  1.1 \nGovernment  35.6  66.9  42.9  109.8  33.3 \n  Total  164.6  197.9  131.6  329.5  100.0 \na  Funds available to the project without supplementary financing.

The ADB loan will finance management services including the costs of extended project \nimplementation consultancy, as well as environmental management costs and a portion of \nresettlement costs. ADB will also finance civil works construction for the Duc Hoa main canal \nand most of the packages for the DHIS. AFD will administer its loan and finance the OSDP, civil \nworks construction for the TBIS, and one of the packages for the DHIS.  \n \nF.  Remedial Steps   \n27.  The  main  constraints  on  achieving  project  construction  as  scheduled  under  the \nsupplementary loan are (i) the timely conclusion of land acquisition and resettlement, which, \naccording to ADB requirements, must be completed before commencing construction on the \nrelevant sections, and (ii) delays in processing construction design approvals and contracting \nconstruction.  To  accelerate  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  PPMBs  will,  under  ICMB9 \nsupervision, ensure that detailed measurement surveys are completed without delay following \nthe finalization of detailed design for project canals and irrigation systems, and that resettlement \nplans are updated and promptly submitted to ADB for approval. PPMBs will prepare budget \nrequests, and ICMB9 will facilitate their approval by MARD and the Ministry of Finance. The \nPSC will request provincial people\u2019s committees (PPCs) to ensure that (i) provincial and district \nresettlement committees are active, (ii) funds for resettlement are disbursed as rapidly as \npossible,  and  (iii)  grievances  are  urgently  addressed  according  to  agreed  procedures.  To \nfacilitate this, a representative from the PPC of HCMC will be added to the PSC.  \n \n28.  Delays in preparing and implementing construction contracts for phase 2 could require \nfurther extending the loan closing date and additional cost overruns. This risk will be mitigated \nby ensuring the timely completion of ongoing construction design and the advance preparation \nof phase 2 construction bidding documents and contracting procedures. ICMB9 will create and \nmaintain a database of all project contracts, including contract adjustments that can be included \nin project reports, to maintain up-to-date reconciliation of funds.  \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n29.  Current implementation arrangements will be maintained for supplementary financing. \nMARD has delegated project management responsibility to ICMB9, including construction of \nDuc  Hoa  main  canal.  PPCs  in  Tay  Ninh  and  Long  An  provinces  and  HCMC  are  the \nimplementing  agencies  responsible  for  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  under  phase  2. \nProvincial departments of agriculture and rural development and their PPMBs are responsible \nfor implementing and managing the design and construction of primary, secondary, tertiary, and \non-farm  canal  systems  in  the  irrigation  areas  and  for  implementing  the  OSDP.  Existing \n ", "7 \narrangements for resettlement monitoring, environmental management, accounting, auditing, \nand reporting will be maintained under supplementary financing.  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2011\u2013March 2014 \nEstimated completion date  31 March 2014 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Project steering committee \nVice minister, MARD (chair)  \n(ii)   Executing agency  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development \n(iii)  Key implementing  PPCs and departments of agriculture and rural development of Binh Duong, Binh \nagencies  Phuoc, Tay Ninh and Long An provinces; and PPC of HCMC  \n(iv)  Implementation unit  ICMB9, with 30 staffers located in HCMC  \nProcurement  ICB  1 contract  $29.8 million \nNCB  14 contracts  $58.4 million \nConsulting services  SSS  594 person-months  $3.4 million \nQCBS  110 person-months  $4.3 million \nRetroactive financing and  For detailed designs and the completion of resettlement plans based on them, up to \nadvance contracting  $12 million, or 20% of the ADB loan, can be used for expenditures incurred before \nloan effectiveness but not more than 12 months before the signing of the loan \nagreement. \nDisbursement   The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nupon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, HCMC = Ho Chi Minh City, ICB = international competitive bidding, ICMB9 = \nHydraulic Project Investment and Construction Management Board No. 9, MARD = Ministry of Agriculture and Rural \nDevelopment, NCB = national competitive bidding, PPC = provincial people\u2019s committee, QCBS = quality- and cost-\nbased selection, SSS = single-source selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n30.  With ADB supplementary loan financing, the project will be extended by 3 years to 9.5 \nyears, with completion expected by 31 March 2014. AFD cofinancing will continue for a further 2 \nyears until 31 March 2016 to facilitate farmers\u2019 completion of on-farm irrigation systems and \nsupport the adoption of improved agricultural methods for irrigation systems. \n \n31.  Civil works and related services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement under the AFD loan will follow \nAFD guidelines. State-owned enterprises will be eligible to bid for contracts if they are legally \nand financially autonomous, are independent of MARD and provincial departments, and operate \non the basis of commercial law and practice.  \n \n32.  The civil works in phase 2 are small canals over a wide expanse in isolated areas. \nTechnical designs are simple, local firms are experienced, and local labor is expected to be \nused extensively. As it is highly unlikely that overseas firms would be interested, it is proposed \nthat the threshold for international competitive bidding be raised from $2 million to $5 million, so \nthat civil works estimated at $5 million or less will be procured by national competitive bidding \n(NCB) using ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents for small works. A grievance point person will \nbe designated for each contract. \n \n33.  Goods will be procured through international competitive bidding if more than $500,000, \nNCB if $100,000\u2013$500,000, and shopping if less than $100,000. The government\u2019s standard \n ", "8 \nbidding documents and procedures will be used for shopping and NCB if they comply closely \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.7  \n \n34.  The firm Black and Veatch International provided project implementation and integrated \nmanagement services during phase 1, and its performance was assessed as highly satisfactory. \nThe executing agency requested that the same firm be contracted by single-source selection for \nphase 2, as the work is a natural continuation of services commenced under phase 1.  \n \n35.  National  consultants  employed  in  phase  1  whose  performance  was  assessed  as \nsatisfactory will be contracted again following single-source selection, as these services are also \nnatural  continuation.  Otherwise,  replacement  consultants  will  be  selected  by  consultant \nqualification selection. Other national consultants will be recruited to supervise the detailed \ndesign and construction of various components following quality- and cost-based selection with \nan 80:20 ratio of technical considerations to cost.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n36.  The project will increase water supply, make it more reliable, and produce benefits \nthrough irrigation and DMI water use. The primary irrigation benefit is increased agricultural \nproduction.  Secondary  benefits  that  cannot  necessarily  be  quantified  include  (i)  salinity \nabatement in the Saigon and Vam Co Dong rivers; (ii) improved drainage associated with \nirrigation infrastructure; and (iii) other multiple use and domestic use benefits such as the \nrecreational  use  of  reservoirs,  improved  water  supply  for  cleaning  and  drinking  in  rural \nhouseholds and watering home gardens, and impacts on health and livelihood.  \n \n37.  Economic analysis of phase 1, with estimated costs of $174.6 million and benefits from \n34 m3/second of DMI water, resulted in an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 10.8%. \nEconomic analysis for both phases 1 and 2, with estimated costs of $329.5 million and including \nbenefits  from  20,545  ha  of  irrigation  in  the  TBIS  and  DHIS,  plus  benefits  from  supplying \nsupplementary irrigation water to a further 3,557 ha directly from the Duc Hoa main canal, \nresulted in an EIRR of 12.3%. DMI benefits arise from water distributed by the project in the four \nprovinces and HCMC. The economic return for phase 2\u2014funded by supplementary loans to \ncomplete the TBIS and the DHIS, with all investment in phase 1 considered a sunk cost, and \nwith  agricultural  benefits  from  the  two  irrigation  areas,  supplementary  irrigation,  and  7.5 \nm3/second of DMI water\u2014generates an EIRR of 16.9%.8   \n \n38.  The economic analysis shows that continuing the investment in phase 2 to complete the \nproject is viable, with a higher economic return than the option of stopping the project with \nphase 1. However, the economic return is sensitive to the timing of benefit realization, with any \ndelay in completing the infrastructure and the primary, secondary, tertiary, and on-farm irrigation \nnetwork  significantly  damaging  economic  performance.  Adequate  maintenance  of  the \ncompleted  infrastructure,  ongoing  support  to  farmers  in  irrigation  management,  and  the \nfunctioning of PIM are also important to achieving the full potential of the investment.  \n \n                                                 \n7  Revisions to the Project Administration Memorandum (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n39.  Farm budget analysis indicates a considerable increase in annual net farm income, \nranging from $1,150 to $1,682 per ha, increasing farm income by 102% to 258%.9 The financial \ngain from irrigation development will give farmer beneficiaries incentive to participate in the \nproject. Further, long-term demand for water for rural and DMI use seems assured, as studies of \nwater resources indicate future water shortages in the region as it develops economically, \nespecially industrially in Long An Province, so economic benefits appear to be sustainable.  \n \nB.  Social Impacts \n40.  A total of 4,683 households (including 14 ethnic minority households) with 21,537 people \nwill  be  affected  by  construction  in  phase  2.  Of  these,  1,151 households  are  expected  to \nexperience severe effects. A total of 22 ha of residential land and 692 ha of agricultural and \nother land will be permanently acquired. For the Duc Hoa main canal, 80 households will have \nto  relocate  their  houses  and  shops.  For  the  DHIS,  36 households  and  two  shops  will  be \nrelocated. For the TBIS, eight households will have to relocate. Preliminary inquiries reveal that \nmost affected households will take cash compensation and manage their own relocation. On top \nof assistance and allowances provided to affected people, social support programs will be \nimplemented to ensure that their incomes are restored and their livelihoods developed. Some \naffected people will seek government assistance to arrange a new settlement site.10  \n \n41.  The government and ADB have  agreed on a resettlement framework that sets out \ncompensation and other entitlements for any land acquisition and resettlement.11 It has been \nupdated and complies with current government policy and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) and will be applied under supplementary financing. The project remains category A for \nresettlement. Resettlement plans have been prepared for the TBIS,12 Duc Hoa main canal,13 \nand DHIS.14 They will be updated upon the completion of detailed engineering designs and the \ncollection of data from detailed measurement surveys.  \n \n42.  Fourteen Khmer ethnic minority households with 60 people live in the Tan Bien irrigation \narea. None of them is severely affected by land acquisition or resettlement.15 The project will not \nnegatively affect (i) customary rights to use, and access to, land and natural resources; (ii) \nsocioeconomic status; (iii) cultural and communal integrity; (iv) health, education, livelihood, and \nsocial security status; or (v) the recognition of indigenous knowledge. Further, the vulnerability \nof  affected  ethnic  minorities  is  not  worsened.16 There  are  10,553  females  living  in  4,683 \nhouseholds affected by the project.17  \n \nC.  Environmental Impacts  \n43.  In  accordance  with  ADB  policies  for  supplementary  financing,  an  addendum  to the \nenvironmental management plan has been prepared.18 As the project scope is unchanged, it \n                                                 \n9  The increase in farm income is higher in the DHIS than in the TBIS because more intensive agriculture is practiced \nin Duc Hoa and the impact of improved irrigation is greater. \n10  Resettlement Issues (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11  Resettlement Framework: Updated (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12  Resettlement Plan: Tan Bien Irrigation (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13  Resettlement Plan: Duc Hoa Main Canal (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14  Resettlement Plan: Duc Hoa Irrigation (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy: Updated (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n16  Updated Poverty and Social Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  Addendum to the Environment Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nremains environmental category A. Potentially significant impacts have been mitigated through \npreventive measures and offsets currently under implementation. Impacts pertaining to the \nsupplementary  loan  are  temporary,  reversible,  and  localized,  and  no  significant  adverse \nenvironmental impacts are foreseen.  \n \nD.  Risks  \n44.  Farmers\u2019 slow adoption of irrigated agriculture has the potential to delay benefits. In \nprevious irrigation projects where only primary and secondary canals were completed, farmers \nwere unable to mobilize resources to complete tertiary and on-farm infrastructure. The project \nwill adhere to provincial government policy and complete construction to the tertiary level with \nassistance from counterpart funds. Farmers\u2019 contributions will be limited to constructing on-farm \nirrigation systems and providing labor for maintenance of tertiary canals. Further, the OSDP will \nfacilitate  the  formation  of  water  users  groups  and  the  extension  of  irrigated  agriculture \ntechnologies based on market demand. With this support, farmer adoption is expected to be \nrapid.  \n \n45.  An integrated river basin approach involving all government agencies active in water \nresources  management  is  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  needs  of  all  stakeholders  are \nconsidered. While the project design provides for organizational capacity building to manage the \nneeds of rural and DMI water users, a more comprehensive approach will be adopted by \ncooperating with related initiatives that also consider the operational demands of upstream \nhydropower companies. AFD is providing a technical assistance grant to study integrated river \nbasin management and address these concerns.19 \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n46.  The government has assured ADB that the implementation of the project shall conform \nto all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in loan \ndocuments. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n47.  I am satisfied that the proposed supplementary loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nsupplementary loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR38,594,000 to the Socialist Republic \nof Viet Nam for the Phuoc Hoa Water Resources Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms \nand  conditions  as  are  substantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n9 March 2011               President \n                                                 \n19 Terms of Reference for Integrated River Basin Management Study (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK: UPDATED \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources/ Reporting \nDesign Summary  and/or Indicators  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nSustainable economic  Real average economic  Updates of the general  Stable political and local security \ngrowth in rural, urban,  growth rate in the project  master plan report for  conditions \nand industrial areas in  area increases from 6.4% to  social economic \nRisks \nHCMC and surrounding  8.5% during the period 2016  development of the south \nprovinces in accordance  to 2020   east region  Rapidly changing economic \nwith the regional master  situation and production patterns \nplan \n  Adverse global climate change \nOutcome      Assumptions \nAdditional water supplies  55 cubic meters of water per  Daily records of the  Dau Tieng IMC building capacity \nin the Saigon and VCD  second diverted from the Be  system monitoring basin  to efficiently manage basin \nriver basins for irrigation,  River to the Dau Tieng  transfers from Phuoc Hoa  transfers \nDMI use, and salinity  Reservoir on the Saigon  to Dau Tieng Reservoir  \ncontrol efficiently  River by 2014  Surplus supplies continuing to be \nprovided and sustainably  Monitoring reports of the  available in the Be River for \n \nensured  IMCs  diversion to Dau Tieng Reservoir. \n \n  Risks \nExtraordinary weather events \nsuch as prolonged drought and \ntyphoons \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
