During the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan fact-finding mission for the proposed \nPower Sector Expansion Project in May 2007, the Government of the Independent State of \nSamoa (the Government) confirmed its request for a technical assistance (TA) cluster for the \ndevelopment  of  sustainable  and  reliable  electricity  services  to  support  economic  growth. \nFollowing the Government\u2019s request, an understanding was reached on the TA cluster impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference.1 The TA cluster is included in the Country Operations Business Plan (2007\u20132009) for \nSamoa.2\n \n2.  The TA cluster forms part of the Government\u2019s power sector development program and \nis included in the Power Sector Expansion Project. The TA cluster will provide support for (i) the \nestablishment of a clean energy fund (CEF); (ii) the establishment and capacity building of a \ndesignated national authority (DNA) for the clean development mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto \nProtocols; (iii) regulatory and policy reform in the power sector; and (iv) resident financial \nmanagement  advisors  (RFMAs)  to  the  Electric  Power  Corporation  (EPC).  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Despite  vulnerabilities  to  external  shocks,  the  Independent  State  of  Samoa  has \nexperienced a stable economic growth over the last 5 years. Real gross domestic product grew \nat around 4% per annum, well above the average growth rate of the Pacific region economies. \nEconomic growth is mainly driven by agriculture, construction, finance, and business services. \nSamoa is also benefiting from an increase in tourism. Further broadening of economic activity \nand private sector development are key strategies to sustain economic growth rates and reduce \npoverty.  The  Government\u2019s  Strategy  for  the  Development  of  Samoa  2005\u20132007  lays  the \nfoundation for sustainable and broad-based economic growth supported by continued reforms \nand private sector development to improve the quality of life for all people in Samoa. Ensuring \nthat sufficient power is available to meet growing demand is essential to achieve a broader \neconomic base and reduce the country\u2019s vulnerability to external shocks. \n \n4.  Samoa has undergone a rapid transformation over the last decade towards an energy \nsupply based on imported petroleum and hydropower-generated electricity. This transformation \nhas been driven by economic growth that has resulted in increasing demand for electricity and \ntransportation. Energy demand in Samoa is met by three main sources: biomass (47%), fossil \nfuel (45%), and hydropower (8%). Biomass is mainly used for cooking, whereas imported \npetroleum is used for transportation and power generation. Fuel imports have increased by \nmore than 30% since 1998. In 2006, imports of petroleum products accounted for 15% of \nSamoa\u2019s total import expenditure. The transport sector accounts for about 80% of imported \nfossil fuels while power generation absorbs the remaining 20%. \n \n5.  Developing clean, indigenous, and renewable energy resources, and promoting energy \nconservation to reduce the economy\u2019s risk exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and fuel \nprice increases is a high development priority for Samoa and articulated in the Strategy for the \nDevelopment of Samoa 2005\u20132007. Likewise, the Samoa National Energy Policy, approved in \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 4 July 2007.  \n2  ADB. 2007. Country Operations Business Plan (2007\u20132009): Independent State of Samoa. Manila. \n ", "2   \nJune 2007, identifies the need to promote clean and renewable energy resources and efficiency \nin the energy sector to reduce Samoa\u2019s heavy reliance on imported fossil fuel. Renewable \nenergy initiatives in Samoa have been funded by international donors on an ad-hoc basis with \nlittle coordination between the various activities. In response to the need for greater coordination, \nthe  Energy  Unit  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  has  been  mandated  with  the  overall \nresponsibility for policy and strategic planning for the energy sector. Despite Samoa\u2019s active \ninvolvement in a number of clean and renewable energy efficiency initiatives, the institutional \narrangements for participating in the clean development mechanism has yet to be established. \n \n6.  EPC  is  a  wholly  owned  government  corporation  and  vested  with  all  operating \nresponsibilities for the power sector. The EPC Act (1980) and the EPC Amendment Act (2001) \nmandate  EPC  with  the  authority for  generation,  transmission,  and distribution of  electricity \nthroughout Samoa. The utility operates as a separate entity and is defined as a public trading \nbody  under  the  Public  Bodies  Act  (2001),  with  the  principal  objective  of  operating  as  a \ncommercial business. \n \n7.  Appropriate  arrangements  for  tariff  setting,  technical  regulation,  and  private  sector \nparticipation are becoming increasingly important for improving the performance of the power \nsector in Samoa. The Government has recognized that the existing arrangements are a key \ndevelopment  constraint  for  the  power  sector  and  is  considering  reforms  to  improve  the \nperformance of the sector and encourage cost-effective private sector participation. Discussions \non regulatory options for the power sector have been taking place as part of project preparation \nfor the proposed power sector expansion project.3 The need to amend the EPC Act has been \nidentified in the Samoa National Energy Policy (2007) and the Government has requested \nADB\u2019s support for the development of an electricity act to govern all stakeholders on the power \nsector in Samoa. The electricity act would establish a regulatory body to (i) remove existing \nregulatory functions out of the EPC, (ii) provide appropriate arrangements for tariff setting, and \n(iii) enable private sector participation to reduce public sector investment requirements and \npromote least cost generation to meet growing electricity demand. \n \n8.  Over  the  past  6  years,  EPC  has  struggled  to  improve  its  financial  performance  to \nsatisfactory levels. Due largely to inadequate tariff levels and poor collections performance, \nEPC has been unable to meet both its debt service obligations and fund capital investments.  To \nensure that timely adjustments to tariffs can be made in response to increases in EPC costs, \nthere is a need to establish a more formal mechanism for determining tariffs within the context \nof an overall regulatory framework for the electricity sector. There is also an opportunity to \nimprove  the  existing  tariff  structure  and  introduce  bulk  purchase  arrangements  with  large \nconsumers to provide incentives for energy conservation and demand-side management. This \nis particularly important during the growing daily peak in demand when EPC relies most heavily \non expensive diesel generation. \n \n9.  A financial management assessment of EPC\u2019s internal controls, accounting, and audit \nprocedures were undertaken in preparation for the power sector expansion project. Although \nEPC\u2019s financial management practices and procedures are considered to be generally adequate, \nthe assessment concluded that EPC would benefit from strengthening its financial controls, \naccounts, and reporting structures. There is also a need for EPC to strengthen longer term \nplanning  and  ensure  that  future  investment  needs  contribute  to  improving  its  financial \nperformance. \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to Samoa for Preparing the Power Sector Expansion Program. Manila. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA cluster forms part of the Government\u2019s power sector development program and \nis included in the proposed Power Sector Expansion Project. The objective is to improve access \nto sustainable and reliable electricity services to all consumers in Samoa by improving the \nquality and reliability and cost-effectiveness of power supply. The TA cluster will (i) promote the \ndevelopment of clean energy resources in Samoa through the establishment of a CEF; (ii) \nenable Samoa to participate and benefit from carbon market trading through the establishment \nand capacity building for the DNA; (iii) develop effective regulation of the power sector and \npromote demand-side management and energy conservation through support to regulatory and \npolicy reform in the power sector; and (iv) help improve EPC\u2019s financial performance through \nprovision of RFMAs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA cluster supports the Government\u2019s priorities for the power sector through four \ncomponents.  Component  1  comprises  the  establishment  of  a  CEF  and  a  CDM  sub-fund. \nComponent  2  will  establish  and  build  capacity  of  a  DNA.  Component  3  will  support  the \nGovernment in undertaking regulatory and policy reform in the power sector. Component 4 will \nprovide two RFMAs to EPC. Capacity building is an integral part of all components. \n \n12.  Component 1: Establishment of the CEF. The CEF will help improve the coordination of \nfinancing sources for clean energy resources in Samoa and is envisaged as a revolving fund. \nComponent 1 will help establish the governance and operational structure, human resources, \nand working and reporting guidelines of the CEF and a CDM sub-fund, identify a project pipeline, \nand increase public awareness on clean and renewable energy. The CDM sub-fund will help \nfinance initial transactions costs associated with getting eligible projects additional financing \nunder CDM. This may include preparation of project design documents (PDD), validation of \nPDDs by an operational entity or independent third party validator, and registration of projects \nwith the CDM Executive Board. \n \n13.  Component  2:  Establishment  and  Capacity  Building  for  the  Designated  National \nAuthority. The establishment of a DNA will enable Samoa to benefit from CDM. Component 2, \nwhich will be implemented jointly with Component 1 to ensure that the two components are well \ncoordinated,  will,  through  a  consultative  process,  establish  the  operational  structure  and \nresource requirements, and develop working guidelines and procedures for the DNA; provide \ncapacity  building  and  hands-on  training  for  stakeholders  and  DNA  staff  in  procedural \nrequirements using a pilot project (identified in the project pipeline under Component 1); and \nraise public awareness on the role, functions, and requirements of the DNA. \n \n14.  Component  3:  Regulatory  and  Policy  Reform  in  the  Power  Sector.  Component  3 \ncomprises  support  for  the  development  of  a  demand-side  management  and  energy \nconservation strategy and a legal framework to govern all stakeholders in the power sector and \nestablish a regulator. The demand-side management and energy conservation strategy will \nfocus on the policy environment and tax incentives to promote energy efficiency. Support to \nregulatory reform will be implemented in three phases allowing for stakeholder consultation and \npolitical decision processes. The first phase will focus on the scoping of a regulatory framework \nthat will allow the Government to make a decision in principle on the roles, functions, and \nstructure of a regulatory agency, including the independence, authority for tariff regulation, and \n ", "4   \naccountability of the regulator and the scope for multi-sector regulation. The first phase will \nguide the direction of subsequent phases. Phase 2 will develop the regulatory framework, \nincluding the drafting of new legislation and amendments to existing legislation for consideration \nby Cabinet and Parliament and the preparation of a detailed budget and resource assessment \nfor approval in the forthcoming budget year. Once the Government has approved the legislation \nand the budget for the regulator, recruitment of a suitable regulator and initial capacity building \nand development of working guidelines of the regulator can commence. \n \n15.  Component 4: Resident Financial Management Advisors to the Electric Power \nCorporation. Two RFMAs, one accountant and one analyst, will be engaged to assist EPC in \nimproving internal budgeting and expenditure controls; consolidating accounts and financial \nreporting and forecasts to the EPC Board, Government, and ADB; and developing peak and off-\npeak tariffs and bulk purchase agreements with EPC\u2019s major customers. Capacity building and \ntraining is an integral task of all aspects of the work. Component 4 will help EPC improve longer \nterm least cost planning, ensure that investments are affordable and contribute to improving \nfinancial  sustainability  and  improve  the  transparency  of  costs  and  tariff  setting  and \naccountability to the Government and consumers. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  cluster  is  estimated  to  be  $2,185,000  equivalent.  The \nGovernment has requested ADB to finance $1,850,000 equivalent. $900,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced by the Government of Australia; $350,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Government of Finland; and $600,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government of Samoa will \nfinance office accommodation, remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff in the equivalent \nof $335,000. The details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The MOF will be the Executing Agency for the TA cluster and has assigned the Energy \nUnit of the MOF as the implementing agency for Component 1, Component 2, and Component \n3.
