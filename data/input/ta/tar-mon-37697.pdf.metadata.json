The  Government  of  Mongolia  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \ntechnical assistance (TA) to prepare the Urban Development and Housing Project. The TA is \nincluded  in  the  Mongolia  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  for  2004\u20132006,1 and  is \nprogrammed for 2005.2 Fact-finding for the TA was undertaken in April 2005 and understanding \nwas reached with the Government on the impact and outcome, scope, cost and financing, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Mongolia experienced rapid urbanization in the second half of the 20th century and this \ntrend accelerated during the transition from a centrally planned to a market-based economy. \nAccording to the 2000 census, the urban population was 1.4 million, equivalent to 55% of the \nnational population of 2.5 million. Rapid urbanization is mainly due to rural-to-urban migration. \nMajor destinations of the migrants are Ulaanbaatar and a few large urban centers. Some 60% of \nthe urban population live in Ulaanbaatar, while 10% live in Darkhan and Erdenet. The remaining \n30% live in 18 provincial capitals with average populations of 24,000. \n \n3.  Under socialist planning, apartment areas were separated from ger areas, a pattern \nwhich is still sustained in every urban area in Mongolia. There is a vast disparity in urban \ninfrastructure and services between apartment areas and ger areas. It is estimated that about \nhalf of the urban population live in ger areas. Over 90% of ger households have electricity, but \nvirtually none are connected to the central heating network; they use individual coal, dung, or \nwood-burning stoves for heating and cooking. Water tankers supply neighborhood water kiosks \nlocated up to 1 kilometer or more from the farthest households. Many other households simply \nget their water from the nearest boreholes or open springs. The cost of water obtained from \nwater kiosks is as much as 20 times that paid by apartment households for centrally supplied \nwater. For sanitation, a majority of ger households use pit latrines because they do not have \naccess to the central sewerage or drainage system. Over 70% of ger households lack access to \nwaste removal points.  \n \n4.  Urban infrastructure and services in apartment areas, while better than those available in \nger areas, are typically old and deteriorated. Mongolia had developed basic infrastructure and \nservices in urban areas with financial assistance from the former Soviet Union (FSU), but the \nprogram stopped when the FSU collapsed. Many urban areas ended up with infrastructure that \nwas not fully installed and a low or unsatisfactory level of services. At the end of 2000, 40% of \nthe urban population had access to piped water, 39% to district heating, and 35% to piped hot \nwater. Outdated technology as well as limited maintenance and repair work over the last decade \nhas  created  serious  deficiencies  that  render  most  of  the  current  infrastructure  networks \nunsustainable for future urban growth. \n \n5.  Almost  36%  of  the  population  live  below  the  poverty  line,  which  varies  between \nMNT20,200 and MNT26,500 per month depending on location. In urban areas, 30% of the \npopulation are poor, and 80\u201390% of the urban poor live in ger areas. Migration is not only a \nfactor  contributing  to  the  growing  underclass  in  urban  areas,  it  is  also  one  of  the  main \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006): Mongolia. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 25 February 2005. \n ", "2   \nconsequences of rural poverty. Most of the in-migrants live in ger areas, and they tend to be \npoorer, less educated, and have worse living conditions than nonmigrants. \n \n6.  Under the centrally planned economy, the locations of settlements, commercial areas, \nindustrial  areas,  and  transport  networks  were  artificially  defined.  Standards  and  norms \nnecessary for planning of urban land use, zoning, and construction are inherited from the FSU \nand do not always fit the natural and social environment of Mongolia. To address this issue, in \n2000  the  Government  started  review  and  revision  of  the  building  codes  and  standards. \nImplementation of building norms, regulations, and standards is also unsatisfactory with a high \nnumber of violations. \n \n7.  The new Government, formed as a result of parliamentary elections in 2004, has defined \nits Action Plan for 2004\u20132008. In the urban development and housing sector, the Ministry of \nConstruction and Urban Development (MCUD) accords high priority to a program to provide \n40,000 families with opportunities to live in housing with improved basic services. The program \nincludes construction and improvement of houses, and upgrading of basic infrastructure. The \nGovernment  plans  to  implement  this  program  through  domestic  resources  and  external \nassistance. Establishment of a sustainable market-based housing finance system is also one of \nthe  Government\u2019s  priorities.  Long-term  mortgage  finance  through  participating  commercial \nbanks was launched in 2003 with support from an ADB-financed project.3  \n \n8.  The Government\u2019s investment in ger areas has been minimal because ger areas were \nconsidered  informal  and  temporary  residential  areas.  However,  along  with  ongoing  land \nprivatization, the present Government has come to consider ger areas as formal and permanent \nresidential  areas.  The  Government  is  planning  to  provide  individual  connections  to  urban \ninfrastructure networks for ger area households especially water supply and sanitation, thus \nreducing the inequality in urban services between the apartment and ger areas. Investment to \nimprove living conditions in ger areas is expected to increase. \n \n9.  ADB has assisted the urban development and housing sector through loan, TA, and \ngrant projects for basic urban services improvements in the provincial capitals, housing finance, \nliving  environment  improvements in  ger  areas,  cadastral  survey  and  land  registration,  and \nregional development planning. ADB has been one of the main sources of external assistance \nfor the sector. The World Bank is implementing the Second Ulaanbaatar Services Improvement \nProject.  Its  objective  is  to  improve  the  quality  of  life  of  the  urban  poor  in  ger  areas  of \nUlaanbaatar by providing basic urban services in a sustainable manner. The World Bank, in \ncooperation with the Cities Alliance, is also developing city development strategies (CDSs) in \nfive provincial capitals. Among other agencies, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, \nUnited Nations Development Programme, United States Agency for International Development \nand German Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit are active in the urban sector. \n \n10.  In  view  of  continued  high  rural-to-urban  migration,  and  the  continued  high  priority \naccorded by the Government to the urban development and housing sector, ADB conducted an \nadvisory TA4 to formulate an urban development and housing sector strategy for 2005\u20132008. \nThis TA is based on the strategic priorities and priority investments and institutional capacity \ndevelopment highlighted under the advisory TA. \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2001.

The objective of the TA is to prepare a project that will improve living conditions and the \nquality of life of the urban population, with a particular focus on the urban poor, and that is \nsuitable  for  ADB  financing.  The  ensuing  project  will  assist  the  Government  to  (i)  provide \nsustainable and affordable infrastructure and services for the urban poor, especially in ger \nareas; (ii) promote community participation in project preparation, implementation, and post-\nproject operation and maintenance activities; and (iii) improve urban planning and management \nand the capacity of government agencies to provide and operate urban services. Impacts on the \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples will not be significant. However, \nassessment will be carried out under the TA and, if necessary, mitigation measures/plans will be \nprepared and included in the project design. A summary initial poverty and social analysis is in \nAppendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will make use of the available sector study results, including the sector strategy \nfor  2005\u20132008  developed  under  TA  4352-MON:  Urban  Development  and  Housing  Sector \nStrategy. It will focus on identifying concrete measures that can be readily operationalized \nthrough discussions with concerned key Government officials and other stakeholders. The TA \nwill  be  conducted  in  close  coordination  with  activities  assisted  by  other  external  funding \nagencies. Although the scope of the ensuing project will be determined after the completion of \nthe TA, the project is expected to comprise two parts: part A: Ger area development, and part B: \nInstitutional development. A participatory approach will be adopted to ensure ownership and \ncommitment of local agencies and beneficiaries. A sector loan approach will be considered in \nUlaanbaatar and other selected viable target cities for implementing part A. To be qualified for \nfunding, interested local governments will be required to show their willingness to actively \ninvolve local communities in the planning, decision making, financing, implementation, and \nmaintenance of subprojects by fulfilling a series of preproject conditions to be identified under \nthe TA. \n \n13.  For part A, based on an assessment of the socioeconomic conditions in urban centers \nand  level  of  urban  services  delivery,  the  TA  will  (i)  investigate  alternative  technologies  of \ninfrastructure (water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, heating, hot water supply, \nroads, and storm water drainage), considering environmental impacts, costs, affordability, and \ninstitutional arrangements; (ii) review the ongoing pilot ger area neighborhoods restructuring \nthat aims to introduce a grid-based circulation system and provide neighborhood-financed and-\nmanaged infrastructure and services, propose improvements, and prepare detailed guidelines; \n(iii) review the proposals for economic, infrastructure, and housing development prepared under \nthe CDSs, and prepare packages suitable for ADB financing; (iv) prepare indicative subproject \ncomponents for developing ger areas, and formulate guidelines to help local governments \nprepare subproject proposals to ensure broad consistency in the types of subprojects and \nvisible development impacts in the target ger area communities; (v) assess the affordability and \neffective cost recovery mechanism, and determine the optimum institutional relationship, funds \nflow mechanism, and effective targeting to support low-income families improve urban services, \nand purchase new plots, build or improve houses; and (vi) identify target cities other than \nUlaanbaatar  based  on  criteria  including  level  of  poverty  and  economic  viability.  Feasibility \nstudies for core subprojects in the target cities will be conducted to (i) prepare preliminary \nengineering  designs  and  cost  estimates,  (ii)  assess  financial  and  economic  viability  and \n ", "4   \nsustainability,  (iii)  assess  environmental  and  social  soundness,  (iv)  develop  a  design  and \nmonitoring framework and implementation arrangements, and (v) establish a set of criteria and \nguidelines to select subprojects to be proposed by interested local governments. In assessing \nsocioeconomic benefits, an impact of reduced costs for improved public services on ger area \nfamily income will be analyzed. \n \n14.  In part B, the TA will (i) review the revised planning, zoning, and building codes and \nstandards,  design  a  dissemination  program,  and  propose  effective  measures  for \nimplementation; (ii) review the existing CDS reports and prepare a program to improve urban \nplanning approaches through an expansion of the CDS approach; (iii) develop education and \ntraining programs for government agencies and local communities to increase awareness on \npublic health, environmental management, and alternative technologies for urban infrastructure \nand  services;  (iv)  develop  capacity  development  plans  for  local  public  urban  service \norganizations (PUSOs) that are responsible for providing and maintaining urban infrastructure \nand  services;  (v)  review  past  and  ongoing  housing  area  development  schemes,  propose \nimprovements, and revise existing guidelines, with emphasis on public-private partnership; (vi) \nassess the need for further support in developing laws and regulations required for a functioning \nmortgage market; and (vii) recommend a long-term sustainable institutional setup for both the \nprivate sector mortgage market and public sector housing finance to deliver housing loans for \nlow-, moderate-, and middle-income groups. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent, of which $450,000 is in \nforeign exchange and $300,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $600,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $150,000 \nequivalent in local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis: $350,000 equivalent \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  and  $250,000  equivalent  from  the  Poverty  Reduction \nCooperation Fund (PRF)5 administered by ADB. The Government will finance the balance of the \nlocal  currency  cost,  equivalent  to  $150,000,  by  providing  office  space,  utilities,  local \ncommunications, administrative support, and counterpart staff. Detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The TA will require 16 person-months of international and 50 person-months of domestic \nconsulting  services.  The  international  consultants  (with  person-months  in  parentheses)  will \ninclude  an  urban  development  specialist/team  leader  (5);  a  financial  analyst/financial \nmanagement  specialist  (2);  an  economist  (2);  an  urban  planning  and  housing/involuntary \nresettlement specialist (2); an urban infrastructure specialist/civil engineer (1); an alternative \nurban infrastructure/environment specialist (1); a participatory development specialist (1.5); and \na poverty economist (1.5). The domestic consultants (with person-months in parentheses) will \ninclude an urban planner/deputy team leader (3); an institutional development specialist (3); an \nurban codes and regulations specialist (5); municipal engineers in water supply, sanitation, solid \nwaste management, heating, hot water supply, road, and drainage (10); a financial specialist \n(5); an economist/cost estimate specialist (4); a legal specialist (4); a housing/micro-finance \nspecialist (3); an environment specialist (3); a community participation specialist (4); a gender \nand poverty specialist (4); and an involuntary resettlement specialist (2).
