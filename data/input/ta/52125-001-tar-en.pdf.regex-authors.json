INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the development of \nindustry  green  growth  indicators  and  innovative  mechanisms  through  research,  capacity \ndevelopment, and policy advice to promote the green growth of the industries in Guangdong \nProvince in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).1 \n \n2.  The Government of the PRC has requested TA from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nas part of its efforts to establish a comprehensive indicator and evaluation framework, system, \nand implementation mechanism to (i) improve the environmental performance of industries in \nGuangdong, and (ii) support decision-making for future potential green financing. Following a \nmission on 21\u201322 May 2018, ADB and the government reached an understanding on the TA \nobjectives, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, and terms of reference for consultants.2 \nThe TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 for the PRC.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Since the PRC commenced economic reforms in 1978 and its open door policy in 1979, \nGuangdong  has  rapidly  developed  from  a  lagging  agricultural  area  into  the  country\u2019s  key \nmanufacturing base. As of 2016, Guangdong was the most populous region in the country and \nranked first among the PRC regions in gross regional product, accounting for 11% of the PRC\u2019s \ngross domestic product.4 By economic sector, its gross regional product ratios in 2016 were \n4.6 (primary), 43.4 (secondary), and 52.0 (tertiary). About 79% of Guangdong\u2019s gross regional \nproduct is concentrated in the Pearl River Delta, which creates regional disparity within the \nprovince.5 \n \n4.  Environmental degradation is a serious issue for the PRC. Guangdong, which took a lead \nrole at the time of the economic opening, also took a very active role in remedying environmental \nissues. As guided by the central government, Guangdong established policies to achieve an \nenvironmentally friendly society and promote green growth.6 However, it still relies heavily on a \nhigh-input, high-consumption, and high-emission development model. Industries consume more \nthan 60% of the total energy in Guangdong. Small and medium-sized enterprises support its \nmanufacturing industry, but most of them are in the lower hierarchy of industrial supply chains \nthat still largely depend on traditional labor, energy, and resource-intensive production methods. \nThe provincial government agencies issued various policies and measures to promote the green \ngrowth of industries but they are fragmented and do not provide practical guidance for enterprises, \nindustrial parks, or cities on how to adopt and implement environmental improvement measures. \n                                                \n1  According to the classification used in the China Statistical Yearbook, the secondary economic sector includes \ngongye (industries) and construction. Gongye covers (i) mining; (ii) manufacturing; and (iii) production and supply of \nelectricity, heat, gas, and water. In this paper, \u201cindustry\u201d and \u201cindustries\u201d refer to \u201cgongye.\u201d \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 October 2018. \n3  ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2018\u20132020. Manila.  \n4   Guangdong had 109.99 million people in 2016, accounting for 8% of the country\u2019s population. Guangdong\u2019s gross \nregional product was CNY8.085 trillion in 2016. Its per capita gross regional product is ranked seventh in the PRC \nafter Beijing, Fujian, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Zhejiang provinces and cities. National Bureau of Statistics of \nChina. 2017. China Statistical Yearbook 2017. Beijing: China Statistics Press. \n5   Guangdong Province consists of 21 prefecture-level cities.

To solve the problem of fragmented policy guidance and the difficulty of putting it into \npractice, the TA team will conduct research on a usable indicator system to evaluate green growth \nopportunities  for  enterprises,  industrial  parks,  and  cities;  and  propose  innovative  ways  for \nGuangdong to promote green growth, such as an evaluation and assessment mechanism, green \nfinancing mechanisms, and selection criteria, which will complement an ongoing ADB study.7 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  the  energy  consumption  per  unit  of \nGuangdong\u2019s major manufacturing products reduced; and the circular economy of more than \n100 economic  parks  in  the  province  improved.8 The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome: \ncomprehensive indicator and evaluation framework on green growth in Guangdong established.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Good practices and lessons on industry green growth and evaluation \nsystem studied and documented. The TA team will support the executing and implementing \nagencies and key policy makers to deepen the understanding of green growth evaluation by the \nfollowing: \n(i)  reviewing existing industry green growth indicators and identify issues and areas \nfor improvement; \n(ii)  conducting field surveys, on-site visits, and interviews to document the status of \nenterprises, industrial parks, and the cities\u2019 industry green growth in Guangdong; \n(iii)  organizing overseas study visits to learn from experience in \n(a)  green growth planning, establishment of a circular industry system, and \ndevelopment of an evaluation system; \n(b)  industry transformation and upgrades, innovative policies on green finance \nand credit, and policy coordination; and \n(c)  energy  conservation,  environmental  protection,  clean  production;  and \npolicies, measures, and actions to incentivize take-up by enterprises; \n(iv)  conducting study visits to regions and cities in the PRC where green industrial and \nurban development is being implemented, to learn from their experiences; and  \n(v)  draft the Guangdong Industry Green Growth Catalogue. \n \n8.  Output 2: Indicators to comprehensively evaluate Guangdong industries\u2019 green \ngrowth developed. Based on the research and lessons, the TA will support the following: \n                                                \n7  The term \u201cindustry green growth\u201d in this TA refers to environmental performance improvement of industries and \nindicators, and indicators will be designed to meet the needs of benchmarking Guangdong\u2019s unique environmental \nchallenges. While the indicator envisaged in this TA solely focuses on the green growth aspect, the underlying idea \nis consistent with the existing efforts such as the Inclusive Green Growth Index that ADB is developing as a new \nbenchmark to measure countries\u2019 well-being by considering broad aspects of development. These are (i) economic \ngrowth,  (ii)  social  equity,  and  (iii)  environmental  sustainability.  S.  Jha.  2018.

The proposed evaluation system and the new mechanisms will be \napplicable to all areas in Guangdong. \n \n9.  Output 3: Financial system and mechanism to promote green development and \ndesign of innovative financing projects prepared. The TA will support the preparation of the \nfollowing: \n(i)  a research report with practical recommendations for innovative public green \nfinancing processes that are compatible with Guangdong\u2019s local situation, e.g., the \nprovincial  transfer  payment  system,  ecological  subsidies,  and  other  financial \nsupport tools;  \n(ii)  a design proposal for green financing projects that meet local needs; and \n(iii)   a list of green financing projects suitable for potential funding support from ADB \nand other foreign financial institutions to promote industry green growth. \n \n10.  TA consultants\u2019 team will develop the indicators and mechanisms in consultation with the \nGuangdong Economic and Information Commission (GDEI) and Guangdong Provincial Finance \nDepartment.  The  pilot  evaluation  exercise  will  rate  the  green  performance  of  enterprises, \nindustrial parks, and cities for internal references. The GDEI will adopt the research outcomes \nand recommendations as standardized tools and mechanisms and apply them to activities such \nas  comprehensive  utilization  of  industrial  solid  waste,  assessment  of  energy  conservation, \nplanning of pollution prevention and control, development of a resource recycling base, and \nfunding support for the industries\u2019 energy conservation and environmental protection efforts. The \nexecuting agencies will submit the policy proposals to the provincial government for inclusion in \nits Fourteenth Five-Year Plan. Toward the end of the TA, ADB and the executing agencies will \ndecide on how to disseminate the final reports as knowledge products, either in summary or in \nfull, in English or in Chinese. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $350,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).
