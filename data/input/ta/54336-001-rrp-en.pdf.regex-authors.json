THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Supporting  Post-COVID-19  Small-Scale \nEmployment Creation Project. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for \nCapacity Development for Post-COVID-19 Small-Scale Employment Creation, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe TA. \n  \n2.  The proposed loan is a financial intermediation loan for a line of credit of up to $150 million \nfrom the ordinary capital resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the Government of \nBangladesh. Through Bangladesh Bank, the nation\u2019s central bank, the fund will be relent to \nparticipating financial institutions (PFIs). The PFIs will onlend the funds to cottage, micro, and \nsmall enterprises (CMSEs)1 started or operated by targeted vulnerable groups\u2014unemployed or \nunderemployed youth, returning migrant workers, and rural entrepreneurs with a focus on women \nentrepreneurs. The attached TA amounting to $900,000 will help strengthen the institutional \ncapacity of Bangladesh Bank and PFIs, support the intended target groups, and develop an action \nplan to expand financial access to formal banking for micro and small entrepreneurs. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Bangladesh has made substantial progress in social and economic development. Its gross \ndomestic product (GDP) more than doubled from 2013 to 2019, growing at an annual rate of 7%. \nPowered  by  the  strong  economy  and  supported  by  inclusive  economic  policies,  overall \nemployment grew by 2.4% per year, with female labor participation increasing from 23.9% in 2000 \nto 36.3% in 2017. Despite this progress, the country still faces challenges in providing jobs for its \ngrowing  population.  Each  year,  about  2  million  youths  enter  the  job  market  with  limited \nopportunities. In 2018, despite a low unemployment rate of 4.3%, the share of informal sector \njobs remained high at 85.1%. The task of providing quality jobs is complicated by the decreasing \ncorrelation between job creation and GDP growth, as industries are becoming more capital \nintensive and agriculture production more mechanized. \n \n4.  The  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  has  exacerbated  the  employment \nproblem. GDP growth slowed to 3.5% in FY2020 from 8.2% in FY2019.2 The government \nestimated that the poverty level rose to 29.4% in 2020 from 20.5% in 2019.3 Millions of jobs are \nunder threat, especially in the export and service industries. With the absence of any large-scale \nunemployment protection schemes, job losses lead to imminent poverty. A few groups\u2014youth, \nreturning migrants, and rural workers\u2014have emerged as severely affected and are among the \nworst prepared to cope with the pandemic. \n  \n5.  Youth. The share of youth who are not in education, employment, or training was 27.4% \nin 2017 (44.6% for women).4 The youth unemployment rate was high at 11.9% in 2019 and is \nexpected to rise to 20.5% after the pandemic as youth tend to be employed in the sectors worst \n \n1   This project targets (i) cottage industry, (ii) microenterprises, and (iii) rural small business (located outside of Dhaka \nand Chattogram areas). The definition of cottage, micro, and small business follows Bangladesh Bank conventions.    \n2  ADB. 2021. Asian Development Outlook 2021 Update: Transforming Agriculture in Asia.

Returning overseas migrant workers. About 400,000 overseas workers have returned \nto Bangladesh because of the pandemic. According to a survey conducted in 12 districts, 70% of \nthe returning migrant workers are unemployed, 16% are in the informal sector, and 32% of the \nrespondents aspire to start enterprises, but most lack access to funds.6 \n \n7.  Rural workers. The agriculture sector employs 40.6% of the workforce, but farm workers \nhave the lowest income of workers in all sectors. In 2019, the rural areas had 1.82 million \nunemployed people\u2014more than double the 0.77 million in the urban area. A 2020 United Nations \nsurvey found reduced income in 33% of rural households after the pandemic.7 Internal migration \nto urban centers has been reversed, putting more pressure on rural employment.  \n \n8.  The government has taken a three-pronged approach to assist these vulnerable groups. \nFirst, it expanded the social safety net to protect the most vulnerable. Second, it took steps to \nhelp the industry stay in business and keep workers employed. Third, recognizing the budget \nconstraints to expanding the social safety net and the likely sluggish job creation by the industry, \nit  has  undertaken  small-scale  employment  generation,  in  which  the  government  supports \nmembers of targeted groups to engage in small-scale business activities to create livelihoods and \npotentially new jobs. ADB has provided active and timely assistance to the government to expand \nthe social safety net and support employment protection.8 The proposed project to promote small-\nscale employment will mark ADB\u2019s comprehensive support to the government to mitigate the \nadverse impact of the pandemic on employment. \n \n9.  Most of the entrepreneurship activities in which the targeted groups engaged are in \nCMSEs,  particularly  cottage  and  micro  enterprises.  Although the  pandemic  highlighted  the \nimportance  of  CMSEs  in  employment  generation,  supporting  CMSEs  has  been  part  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s  long-term  strategy  to  tackle  employment  challenges,  as  outlined  in  both  the \nPerspective Plan of Bangladesh 2021\u20132041 and the Eighth Five Year Plan (footnote 3). While \nthe short-term agenda of supporting vulnerable groups and the long-term strategy of CMSE \ndevelopment have good confluence, they also share challenges\u2014heightened by the pandemic\u2014\nand one of the most critical challenges is access to financing.9 \n \n10.  Even before the pandemic, an International Finance Corporation survey found that 55% \nof small enterprises face challenges in accessing financing.10 During the pandemic, many of these \nenterprises are struggling to meet working capital shortfalls. Female workers and entrepreneurs \nexperience more severe hardships because of their concentration in the service sector and \nweaker financial status. \n \n5  ADB. 2020.

The  survey  covered  the  whole  cottage,  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprise \n(CMSME) segment. Within this segment, cottage and micro enterprises\u2014where members of the \ntargeted groups of this project are concentrated\u2014are further marginalized. Among the CMSMEs, \nfunding is skewed toward medium-sized enterprises, such that the situation is exacerbated for \nCMSEs where the financing gap is a significant percentage of the demand. A 2016 study \nestimated that the financing needs of the segment total Tk737 billion a year.11 The cottage and \nmicro enterprises are primarily supported by microfinance institutions (MFIs) or informal funding \nsources with very high lending rates and related fees. The banking industry provided only 4% of \nthe financing needed by cottage and micro enterprises compared with 11% by MFIs, with the rest \ncoming from the enterprises\u2019 own resources. With control of most of the financial assets and \naccess to low-cost funds, the banking industry has the potential to provide more support to \nCMSEs. However, most of the banking industry is constrained by risk appetite, cost structure, \nbranch locations, and lending practices. \n \n12.  To bridge the financing gap for CMSEs\u2014facilitating the execution of the small-scale \nemployment creation strategy, efficient financing conduits need to be identified or developed, not \nonly to channel financial resources but also to champion workable solutions for accessing finance. \nA few banks, nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), and specialized banks12 stand out in their \nsupport for CMSEs. Commercial banks such as BRAC Bank and Bank Asia Limited,13 and NBFIs \nsuch as IDLC Finance Limited,14 have the expertise, processes, and systems in place to target \nthe sector efficiently. However, they continue to struggle to provide affordable loans to the \nsegment while maintaining a sustainable margin to offset the risks involved in lending to high-risk \nborrowers. A few state-owned financial institutions\u2014Karmasangsthan Bank, Probashi Kallyan \nBank,  and Palli  Sanchay Bank\u2014specialize  in this sector.15  They  are  mandated  to lend  to \nunderserved sectors, operate in remote areas, and provide countercyclical support. Further, \nprograms in these banks often provide extension services such as business support and linkage \nwith skills development that help improve the success rate of their clients. However, these \ninstitutions are constrained by the lack of liquidity and high cost of funds because of their restricted \naccess  to  low-cost  deposits.  Some  of  them  are  also  constrained  by  weaknesses  in  their \noperations, financial management, and risk management capacities. \n \n13.  Considering the multitude of challenges and the urgent need for supporting CMSEs during \nthe pandemic, the project team proposes a three-pronged approach in this project. First, funds \nshould be provided and channeled through the most efficient institutions to ramp up lending to \nCMSEs and targeted groups. Funding costs need to be kept low to allow financial institutions to \nmaintain  a  reasonable  margin  while  keeping  the  costs  down  for  borrowers.  Second,  the \ngovernment and the regulators should work with the banking industry to take steps to lower \n \n11 Institute for Inclusive Finance and Development. 2016.

In 2019, it disbursed Tk35 billion to CMSMEs\u201432,655 fresh loans \nthrough its 187 branches and 457 small and medium-sized enterprise offices in rural areas. Bank Asia disbursed \nTk23 billion in 2020 to CMSMEs through its 129 branches, 6,000 agent points, and its collaboration with hundreds \nof Union Digital Centers and 20,000 micro merchants.  \n14 IDLC Finance Limited has the largest CMSME portfolio among the NBFIs at Tk34 billion. In 2020, during the \npandemic, it disbursed Tk15.3 billion to 15,749 CMSME clients.     \n15 Karmasangsthan Bank focuses on lending to unemployed youth  who have received  trainings from certified \ngovernment training programs. Karmasangsthan Bank\u2019s cumulative loan disbursement has reached Tk68.8 billion, \ncreating 2.3 million jobs. Probashi Kallyan Bank provides rehabilitation loans to returning expatriate workers as well \nas migration loans, serving 42,800 clients. Palli Sanchay Bank promotes micro-savings and investments in rural \nareas and provides financial services to 3.61 million rural families. \n \n ", "4 \noperational costs and manage risks. Credit guarantees and insurance, though not available for \nthis project, should be reformed and made widely available to mitigate the credit risk. Best \npractices such as fit-for-purpose management information systems, business support services, \nand  fintech  should  be  promoted  within the  industry.  Finally,  since  state-owned  specialized \nfinancial institutions will remain a significant force in financing CMSEs, especially during crises, it \nis critical to support their efforts while helping to improve their institutional capacities. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s strategic context and policy framework. This project is well aligned with the \ngovernment\u2019s top priority\u2014addressing the challenges of COVID-19\u2014as indicated in its Eighth \nFive Year Plan (footnote 3). It will help create gainful job opportunities, which is a priority area in \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2021\u20132025 for Bangladesh,16 and is included in the country \noperations business plan, 2021\u20132023.17 It is aligned with the operational priorities (OPs) of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030.18 The project will help alleviate poverty by creating employment opportunities and \nsupporting entrepreneurship (OP1), help strengthen the governance and institutional capacity of \nseveral  key  institutions crucial  for  employment creation  (OP6), support  gender  equality  by \nproviding  inclusive  financing  and  gender-sensitive  capacity-building  activities  (OP2),  and \ncontribute to the development of sustainable financing to address climate change, building climate \nand disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability (OP3). Moreover, in line with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, the project will help promote private sector development. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: rapid recovery from COVID-19 to restore \nemployment, income, and economic activities (footnote 3). The project will have the following \noutcome: adverse economic effects of COVID-19 on migrants, youth, and rural entrepreneurs \nmitigated.19 \n  \n16.  Output 1: Financial support to enterprises started or operated by migrants, rural \nenterprises, and youth from the formal banking sector increased. The project will provide a \n$150 million credit line to PFIs to increase financing to unemployed youth, returning migrants, and \nrural entrepreneurs to start or expand their enterprises. At least 20% of the borrowers will be \nfemale micro-entrepreneurs. Subject to meeting the eligibility criteria for PFIs (para. 28), funds \nwill be allocated to the PFIs based on their projected 6-month funding needs for onlending to \neligible CMSEs following the agreed selection criteria (para. 29). These PFIs are expected to put \nin place appropriate risk mitigation measures, including robust risk management and linkages \nwith entrepreneurial training programs. The project will support 30,000 micro enterprises, with a \ntargeted  mix  of  5,000  returning  migrants,  14,000  youths,  and  11,000  rural  entrepreneurs. \nBangladesh is highly exposed to climate change impacts. Many of the subborrowers, especially \nthose in agribusiness, are extremely vulnerable to climate change risks. Through this project, they \nwill benefit from both financial and technical support for climate risk adaptations.   \n \n17.  Output 2: Capacity of employment-supporting financial institutions strengthened. \nThe attached TA will support capacity development of the PFIs and potential PFIs. Based on the \nneeds,  diagnostics  study  will  be  conducted.  Support  will  be  provided  to  strengthen  risk \nmanagement capacities, business process and information systems.

Output 3: Action plan for promoting formal banking sector support for cottage, \nmicro, and small enterprises developed. The TA will support the development of an action plan \nto be implemented by the Bangladesh Bank, focusing on improved processes, systems, and \npolicy support for financing CMSEs. The action plan will give special attention to supporting \nwomen entrepreneurs and returning migrants. The action plan will promote mobile phone-based \nfinancing options, fintech platforms, sustainable financing, and value chain financing to enhance \noperational efficiency, risk mitigation strategies, and financial inclusion. The plan will evaluate the \ncurrent credit guarantee scheme to broaden its coverage and improve its sustainability. The TA \nwill support financial literacy training and business development services for entrepreneurs, \nespecially women and returning migrants. The TA will provide support to introduce regional best \npractices and help local enterprises tap into national and regional supply chains.  \n \n19.  The project team considered the country\u2019s experiences and pandemic constraints in the \nproject design. The best distribution channels and programs with value added business support \ncomponents are prioritized, to provide timely support and vulnerability of the target groups. In \ndeveloping a sector-wide action plan, the TA will seek to combine introducing international best \npractices with identifying well-suited local solutions.  \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB  \n \n20.  The project continues ADB\u2019s long-standing support to Bangladesh in financial inclusion. \nThe  Microenterprise  Development  Project  provided  funding  support  through  MFIs  to  the \nmicroenterprises.20 The Second Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development Project loan \nand TA project focused on the financing of CMSMEs located outside the metropolitan areas and \nstrengthened the capacity of entrepreneurs to access bank financing.21 The COVID-19 Active \nResponse and Expenditure Support Program provided timely financial support to the industries \nworst  hit  by  the  pandemic  to  protect  employment  and  industries,  particularly  CMSMEs \n(footnote 9). The success of these projects provided rich experiences and lessons learned, and \ncemented ADB\u2019s strong relationship with the government in working toward financial inclusion. \n \n21.  Mitigating the negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic is the government\u2019s most pressing \npriority. This project is focused on supporting three vulnerable groups for entrepreneurship \nactivities through the banking industry. The intervention is also aligned with a broader financial \ninclusion agenda, especially for the support of CMSEs. This project will result in more sustainable \nand effective investments by the PFIs through ADB\u2019s safeguard, gender, and climate change \nrequirements. Recognizing the important roles played by specialized banks, the project will \nsupport the strengthening of such institutions. Based on the lessons learned from past projects in \nthe CMSE segment, the project aims to address key barriers for financing CMSEs by developing \na comprehensive action plan at the central bank level that will tackle sector-wide challenges, \npromote best practices at the banks, and expand training and business development support to \nthe  borrowers.  Another  important  lesson  learned  is  that  the  project  needs  to  balance  the \n \n20 ADB. 2018.

Bangladesh Bank will onlend the funds to PFIs at an interest rate in line \nwith that of similar Bangladesh Bank programs.23  The loans from PFIs to eligible CMSEs will \nhave a maximum maturity of 5 years, a maximum loan size of Tk5.0 million, and a market-based \nrate that reflects the funding cost of the PFIs and the credit risk of the subborrowers. Funds repaid \nby PFIs will be recycled in the program through a revolving account in Bangladesh Bank. \n \n26.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (concessional loan)  150.0  100.0 \n               Total  150.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n27.  It is expected that agribusinesses, which are vulnerable to climate risks, will account for \nmain portion of the borrowers and many of them will be in locations vulnerable to climate risks. \nClimate adaptation is estimated to account for $15,000,000 or 10% of the loan amount.

Resilience, Entrepreneurship and Livelihood Improvement Project.  \n23 Bangladesh Bank\u2019s current CMSME support programs have interest rates of 2%\u20134%.  \n \n ", "7 \nwill provide additional support of $15,000 for climate adaptation by strengthening PFI\u2019s capacity \nin financing climate risk adaptation (Section III).  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n28.  The Ministry of Finance, through its Finance Division, will be the executing agency and \nBangladesh Bank will be the implementing agency. Bangladesh Bank\u2019s project management unit \nwill  be  established  under  the  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises  and  Special  Program \nDepartment, which will help mitigate the risk in project implementation.  \n \n29.  Selection of participating financial institutions. PFIs will be selected based on their \nfinancial strength and record of support to CMSEs. ADB will assess all potential PFIs to ensure \nthat the eligibility criteria for PFIs have been met.24 The PFIs must maintain a minimum rating of \n2 or better on the CAMELS-based assessment carried out by Bangladesh Bank, which indicates \ndemonstrated capital adequacy, asset quality, liquidity, profitability, and corporate governance. \nAll potential PFIs must have extensive experience supporting the CMSE sector. Karmasangsthan \nBank has a unique and successful program financing youth who have received proper training \nfrom government agencies. BRAC Bank is the largest bank in the country dedicated to supporting \nCMSMEs and is expanding its small-loan program targeting cottage and microenterprises. IDLC \nFinance Limited is the largest NBFI supporting CMSEs. Bank Asia pioneered the agent banking \nmodel and continues to expand its reach to CMSEs in rural areas, now with digital technologies. \n \n30.  Selection of the subborrowers. The subborrowers will be CMSEs started or operated \nby members of three targeted groups, namely, unemployed or underemployed youth, returning \nmigrants, and rural entrepreneurs. At least 20% of the subborrowers will be women. To qualify for \nthe subloans, the subborrowers will need to prepare a business plan to detail the use of the funds \nand demonstrate the viability of the business, contribute at least 20% of the subproject cost, and \nmeet other credit criteria established by the PFIs. The purpose of the subloan will be to establish, \nsustain, and expand business activities.  \n \n31.  Implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the \nproject administration manual.25 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2022\u2013June 2025 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2024 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2025 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project  steering  committee;  Finance  Division,  Ministry  of  Finance \nOfficial (chair)  \n(ii)  Executing agency  Finance Division, Ministry of Finance \n(iii) Key implementing agency  Bangladesh Bank  \n(iv) Implementation unit  Project management unit, 10 staff \nDisbursement  Disbursement of the loan proceeds will follow Asian Development \nBank\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time \nto time) and detailed arrangements agreed between the government \nand Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n24 ADB. 2003.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n32.  TA will be attached to the project to support the strengthening of the institutional capacity \nof Bangladesh Bank and PFIs and to provide business support for the targeted groups. ADB will \nbe the executing agency. The implementing agency will be Bangladesh Bank. The TA outputs \ninclude (i) capacity of employment-supporting institutions strengthened; and (ii) an action plan for \npromoting formal banking sector support for cottage, micro and small enterprises developed.26 \n \n33.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  government  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, office supplies, and \nother in-kind contributions. The TA funds will be disbursed in accordance with the Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). All consultants will \nbe recruited in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and associated staff instructions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n34.  The project will directly support 30,000 CMSEs in Bangladesh, 20% of which are operated \nby women, with low-cost financial resources. The project is expected to have positive impacts on \neconomic growth, development, and employment creation. Significant economic benefits are \nexpected from the increased income because of the jobs created, and outputs of the enterprises \nnewly started or expanded. The project team conducted due diligence on the four potential PFIs \nand they are considered suitable financing channels for this project.27 \n \n35.  Selection of PFIs with track records and existing programs helps improve the targeting \nand mitigate risks. The borrowers will be screened based on PFI\u2019s established credit criteria. PFIs\u2019 \nauxiliary programs such as business support and required skills training further enhances the \nviability of the borrowers. The strength of the PFIs\u2019 risk management capacity\u2014demonstrated by \ntheir low nonperforming loan ratios and robust financial performance and supported by ADB \ncapacity support through TA\u2014is key for the financial viability of the program.  \n \nB.  Sustainability  \n \n36.  The project has a three-pronged approach that will contribute to the sustainability of its \nimpact: (i) financial resources provided through PFIs will be onlent to viable enterprises (selected \nbased on established credit criteria) at a market rate that reflects the funding cost and credit risks, \nallowing CMSME programs in these institutions to grow sustainably; (ii) the attached TA and \nexisting PFI programs will provide business development support for private enterprise borrowers \nto enhance their sustainability; and (iii) the TA will develop a long-term action plan to improve the \nenabling environment for sustainable lending to CMSEs. \n \nC.  Governance  \n \n37.  ADB  has  discussed  its  requirements  and  policies  on  financial  management  and \nprocurement measures, as well as environmental and social safeguards, with the government \n \n26 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n \n ", "9 \nand Bangladesh Bank and incorporated them in the project design. The specific requirements are \ndescribed  in  the  project  administration  manual.  The  assessed  pre-mitigation  financial \nmanagement risk is moderate mainly because of the deteriorating macroeconomic conditions \ncaused by the pandemic. This is mitigated by Bangladesh Bank\u2019s strong financial management \ncapacity, conservative approach, and experience working with ADB and many other development \npartners in similar projects.  \n \n38.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the project administration manual.28 \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n39.  Poverty impact. Job creation is the most effective and sustainable means of poverty \nreduction. The country is facing serious challenges in generating jobs in sufficient amount and \nquality. Supporting CMSEs is one of the most effective and sustainable approaches to growing \nthe economy and generating jobs, especially during the pandemic when the poverty rate is \nsoaring and jobs are scarce. This project will support 45,000 people\u2014including many unemployed \nyouths, returning migrants, and rural entrepreneurs\u2014with access to financing, training, and other \nsupport that will enable them to create jobs for themselves and others. \n \n40.  Gender  and  social  dimensions.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. During the pandemic, women entrepreneurs who had enterprises in jute products, \nhandicrafts, and online shops were affected the most\u201433% reported that their enterprises were \nnot in operation during the pandemic, while 41% revealed that they had to lay off their employees \nduring the lockdown.29 The project commits to women\u2019s empowerment and gender equality by \nhaving explicit and high gender targets for project outputs. At least 20% of the project beneficiaries \nwill be women, compared with 8% of women borrowers in the banking system. The project will \nfocus on building the capacity of women entrepreneurs and provide financial support along with \nthe support from Bangladesh Bank to recover their enterprises. Capacity-building programs under \nthe TA will target women entrepreneurs for financial literacy and incubation programs. ADB will \nhelp develop gender-sensitive corporate strategy in the banks and an action plan at Bangladesh \nBank to strengthen financial inclusion with a special focus on women.30 \n \nE.  Safeguards  \n \n41.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.31 \n \n42.  Environment (category FI\u2013C). The project will support banks engaged in microfinancing \nand rural microenterprise financing, with minimal environmental impact.

Involuntary resettlement (category FI\u2013C). Subprojects with involuntary resettlement \nimpacts (category A and B) are excluded. The CMSEs in this project are not anticipated to have \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts because of the small scale of their operations. \n \n44.  Indigenous peoples (category FI\u2013C). Subprojects with indigenous peoples impacts \n(category A and B) are excluded. Although the project will have no specific interventions to target \nindigenous peoples, any indigenous peoples and/or ethnic groups will have access to credit \nfacilities under the project schemes. \n \n45.   Bangladesh Bank has developed environmental and social screening guidelines for the \nPFIs, which were agreed to by ADB. PFIs will screen all subprojects based on the screening \nchecklist to exclude subprojects with category A or B impacts on the environment, involuntary \nresettlement, tribes, minor races, ethnic sects, and communities; and finance only subprojects \nthat are classified category C. The TA will provide training for Bangladesh Bank and PFI staff on \nsafeguards. Bangladesh Bank will assign experienced staff to oversee safeguard implementation.  \n \nF.
