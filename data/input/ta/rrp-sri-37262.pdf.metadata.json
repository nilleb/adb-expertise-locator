An  environmental  impact  assessment  will  be  an \nAssessment  integral component of the project preparatory process supported \nunder the technical assistance (TA) loan. The Government of Sri \nLanka will provide assurances that any project prepared will be \nimplemented in accordance with environmental guidelines of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB).  \n   \nProject Description  The TA loan will provide a readily accessible pool of funding for \nthe  Government  to  conduct  road  project  preparatory  work. \nAssistance will be provided to prepare feasibility studies, including \nenvironmental  and  social  assessment,  resettlement  plans, \ndetailed designs, bid document preparation and evaluation, and \ncontract negotiations. Assistance may also be extended to cover \nthe  cost  of  engaging  consultants  to  assess  financial  viability, \nformulate  the  project  structure,  and  prepare  concession \nagreements and negotiations for public-private partnership (PPP) \nprojects. \n   \nRationale  The  Government\u2019s  vision  for  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction sets ambitious development targets, which will require \nmassive  development  of  road  infrastructure  and  more  private \nsector  participation.  Timely  road  investment  projects  are \nindispensable  to  economic  progress.  Road  sector  institutions \nneed  to  be  equipped  with  sufficient  capacity  to  carry  out \npreconstruction  activities  on  time  and  efficiently  for  external \nand/or  private  sector  financing.  The  TA  loan  will  provide  a \nfinancing facility that road sector institutions can easily access. \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The objective of the TA loan is to help the Government efficiently \ndevelop the road network. Focusing on road project preparation, \nthe TA loan will (i)  enable road sector institutions to conduct \npreconstruction activities on time, and (ii) ensure readiness of the \nfollow-on road infrastructure projects. The TA loan will also help \nenhance road agencies\u2019 capacity to implement road projects. \n \nThe financing facility will cover roads identified in the investment \nplan  identified  in  the  road  sector master plan currently being \nprepared  under  ADB-assisted  TA.  The  facility  will also cover \nroads proposed by the Government as most urgent before and \nwhile  the  investment  plan  is  developed.  The  TA  loan  will \naccommodate projects intended for downstream ADB financing \nas well as for non-ADB projects. \n   ", "iii \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  loan  is  estimated  at  $20.00  million \nequivalent, comprising a foreign exchange component of $10.25 \nmillion (51% of the total cost) and a local currency component of \n$9.75 million equivalent (49%). \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB will provide a loan of $15 million equivalent to cover the \nentire foreign exchange cost ($10.25 million equivalent) and part \nof  local  currency  costs  ($4.75  million  equivalent).  The \nGovernment will finance the remaining local cost of $5 million \nequivalent.  \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan equivalent to $15 million will be provided from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources,  with  a  maturity  period  of  32  years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and an annual interest rate of \n1% during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2008 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  A steering committee will be established to give overall direction \nArrangements  to the TA loan, and will be composed of representatives of the \nMinistry of Finance; External Resource Department; Ministry of \nPolicy Development and Implementation; Ministry of Transport, \nHighways,  and  Civil  Aviation;  Ministry  of  Highways  (MOH); \nMinistry  of  Home  Affairs,  Provincial  Councils,  and  Local \nGovernment (MHAPCLG); National Planning Department; Board \nof Investment (BOI); Road Development Authority (RDA); Urban \nDevelopment  Authority;  Central  Environmental  Authority;  and \nADB.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  RDA  for  national \nhighways  and  expressways;  relevant  provincial  councils  for \nprovincial roads; and RDA for PPP expressways in consultation \nwith  BOI  with  respect  to  financial  advisory  services.  Each \nimplementing agency (IA) will appoint a facilitator to supervise the \nday-to-day project activities.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  MOH will be the Executing Agency (EA) for expressways and \nnational highways, and MHAPCLG will be the EA for provincial \nroads. \n   \nProcurement  All  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. \n   \n   ", "iv \nConsulting Services  Typically required for road projects are specialists in highway \nengineering,  transport  economics,  transport  finance,  social, \nresettlement, and environment. These specialists will help IAs \ncarry  out  comprehensive  feasibility  analyses  and  engineering \ndesign, prepare bid documents, and help in procurement in a way \nsatisfactory to ADB. Each EA, in consultation with IA, will develop \ndetailed terms of reference and associated resources to fulfill \nthem. \n \nInternational consulting firms, in association with domestic ones, \nwill be engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedures. Individual consultants will be engaged in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. \n \nFor the first year of implementation, approximately 50 and 60 \nperson-months of international and domestic consulting services, \nrespectively,  are  required  for  a  combined  feasibility  and \nengineering  study,  including  procurement  assistance,  for  200-\n300km top-priority roads. Tentative estimates for the whole TA \nloan  are  approximately  500  and  600  person-months  of \ninternational and domestic consulting services, respectively. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  TA  loan  will  support  efficient  development  of  roads  and \nBeneficiaries  thereby contribute to national economic development. The TA \nloan will facilitate road improvements without unnecessary delay \nand benefit road users by enabling them to undertake economic \nactivities efficiently. The TA loan will ensure that (i) the follow-on \ninvestment  projects  will  be  implemented  without  delay,  (ii) \ndevelopment impact of the follow-on investment projects will be \nrealized  without  delay,  and  (iii)  the  Government  will  minimize \ncommitment charges of the follow-on loans in case of ordinary \ncapital resources. The TA loan will also raise EAs\u2019 and IAs' project \npreparation  capacity  to  international  standards  and  improve \ngovernance  and  transparency  in  consultant  selection  and \nprocurement. \n   ", " \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) loan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Road \nProject Preparatory Facility. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n2.  Sri Lanka needs a modern and efficient road network to promote faster economic \ndevelopment as described by the Government of Sri Lanka in the recently published Regaining \nSri Lanka: Vision and Strategy for Accelerated Development1. A Consultation Mission and a \nFact Finding Mission visited Sri Lanka from 30 September-2 October and from 10-21 November \n2003, respectively. The TA loan was developed based on the Memorandum of Understanding \nsigned on 21 November during the Fact Finding Mission, which sets out an understanding \nbetween  the  Government  and  ADB  on  the  goals,  purpose,  scope,  implementation \narrangements, cost estimate, financing arrangements, and terms of reference (TOR) of the TA \nloan.  \n \nB.  The Road Sector \n \n3.  Sri Lanka has 91,803 kilometers (km) of roads, comprising 11,650 km of national \nhighways maintained by the Road Development Authority (RDA); 15,494 km of roads (classes \nC, D, and E) maintained by provincial councils; and 64,659 km of unclassified roads maintained \nby local authorities. The public sector retains most of the responsibilities for providing national \nhighways and other roads. \n \n4.  While Sri Lanka\u2019s road network is extensive, most roads were built more than 50 years \nago. Road maintenance, rehabilitation, and new construction have not kept abreast with the \nrapid growth in demand for transport. Traffic levels now exceed the design capacity of many \nroads. Uncontrolled roadside development has also reduced the network\u2019s capacity. Due to \nneglect of road maintenance, national, provincial, and rural road conditions are poor. All of this \nraises road-user costs, makes roads unsafe, and lowers the quality and frequency of transport \nservices.  Inefficient  transport  has  constrained  economic  expansion  and  poverty  reduction. \nUpgrading the road sector\u2019s overall performance is vital to improve the returns and sustainability \nof investments, contribute to growth of a wide range of other economic activities that make use \nof road transport, and help reduce poverty. \n \n5.  Since the peace process is progressing, an island-wide approach, including in the north \nand east, is needed to expand the road network. A needs assessment2 for the north and east \nreveals  that  immediate  rehabilitation  of  the  main  road  network  is  crucial  to  facilitate \nhumanitarian, social, and economic activities, and to help bring back normalcy. Critical needs \n                                                 \n1   Government of Sri Lanka, December 2002. \n2  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  with  support  from  ADB,  United  Nations,  and  the  World  Bank.  2003.

", "2  \nfor all the country include (i) sufficient road maintenance, (ii) improvement and rehabilitation of \ndeteriorated road networks, and (iii) construction of expressways connecting major cities. \n \n6.  Cohesive vision and mission are needed for the entire sector to lay out the key strategic \nprinciples for road transport in line with the broad national goals for economic and social \ndevelopment.  In  this  context  the  midterm  strategy  for  institutional  and  policy  development \nshould be implemented and adopted, and institutional mechanisms for provinces and local \nauthorities  strengthened  to  finance  and  deliver  roads.  National,  provincial,  and  rural  road \ndevelopment will benefit poor, remote areas isolated from markets. The road sector master \nplan3 is under preparation. The TA loan will be implemented closely with the road sector master \nplan that will produce pipeline sector investment projects, including those agreed on in the \nCountry Strategy and Program (CSP) for 2004-2008. \n \nC.  Government Sector Strategy \n \n7.  The Government adopted a framework of a medium- and long-term sector development \nstrategy after extensive review and dialogue under an ADB TA.4 The Road Sector Development \nProject (RSDP)5, approved in November 2002, was the first of a series of ADB loans to help \nimplement  the  framework.  The  key  targets  under  RSDP  are  (i)  strengthening  RDA,  (ii) \ndeveloping the private sector, and (iii) improving road maintenance funding. \n \n8.  The framework was incorporated and further elaborated in Regaining Sri Lanka which \nsets  out  the  Government\u2019s  vision  for  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  To  foster \neconomic growth, institutional and policy reform is needed to improve the performance of the \nroad sector, including increasing private sector participation and improving road maintenance. \nThe poverty reduction strategy includes creating opportunities for the poor to participate in the \neconomy. An important challenge is linking poor regions to rapidly growing domestic and \ninternational markets. Priority transport and communications initiatives include (i) building an \nintegrated national highway and road network to connect poor regions and production centers to \ndomestic and international markets, (ii) enhancing the performance of the bus system and \nimplementing  a  fare  policy,  (iii)  improving  road  sector  management,  (iv)  implementing  a \ncomprehensive  traffic  management  policy,  (v)  facilitating  rural  transport  development,  (vi) \ndesigning  and  implementing  an  overall  pricing  policy  for  private  transport,  and  (vii) \ninstitutionalizing road safety and discipline.  \n \nD.  External Assistance to the Sector \n \n9.  As of June 2003 the ongoing portfolio amount of ADB loans for the road sector was $321 \nmillion. The most recent loan is RSDP, approved in 2002. The principal bilateral sources of \nexternal assistance have been Japan, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, and Sweden. The United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP) is the largest multilateral grant provider. ADB is the \nlargest multilateral provider and has coordinated its support with other external agencies to \nensure  efficiency  in  road  development.  The  Conflict-Affected  Areas  Rehabilitation  Project, \n                                                 \n3   ADB. 2004.

Manila. ", "  3\napproved in November 2003, also has major road components. Recently, the World Bank \ndecided to reengage in Sri Lanka\u2019s road sector6. External assistance to the road sector is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nE.  Lessons Learned \n \n10.  Implementation of  ADB-assisted road projects in Sri Lanka have been delayed due \nmainly to (i) cumbersome government procurement procedures, affecting projects in all sectors; \n(ii) lack of institutional capacity in RDA for preconstruction and for construction supervision; and \n(iii) lack of capacity and inexperience of the domestic private sector in road construction and \nengineering and related services. Such weaknesses include late appointment of the technical \nevaluation  committee  (TEC),  low  quality  of  TEC  reports,  delayed  finalization  of  contract \ndocuments, delayed approval by Cabinet Appointed Tender Boards and the Ministry of Tender \nBoards, and slow implementation of land acquisition and resettlement (LAR).  \n \n11.  With ADB TA,7 the Government simplified its procurement procedures for externally \nfunded projects, introduced a system of monitoring procurement performance, and established \nthe Procurement Support Bureau in the Ministry of Finance, which is reducing the time for \nprocurement and increasing transparency. Weaknesses of LAR implementation under previous \nloans have been improved under the ADB TAs,8 incorporating experience from the Southern \nTransport Development Project. RSDP (footnote 5)\u2019s recent progress shows that reforms are \nachieving their targets: (i) the Road Construction and Development Company, owned by RDA, \nwas closed at the end of January 2004; (ii) SLRs1 billion of work contracts were awarded to 20 \nprivate contractors in 2003; (iii) reengineering of RDA is under way, e.g., a maintenance \nmanagement unit has been established; and (iv) a road fund was established in 2003 to support \nthe financing of road maintenance on a sustainable basis.  The capacity of provincial road \ndevelopment authorities has also been strengthened through an ongoing program financed by \nADB and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC)9. \n \n12.  A  lesson  is  that  institutional  reforms  need  to  be  comprehensive  but  gradual  and \nsustained if they are to produce lasting improvements (footnote 4). This is difficult to achieve \nthrough a single project. The programmatic approach brings together ADB\u2019s next interventions \nfor  the  road  sector,  creating  the  opportunity  to  link  financing  of  successive  projects  to \nimplementation  of  a  common  medium-term  reform  agenda.  Another  lesson  learned  from \nprocedural delays in project preparation is that up-front project activities, such as environmental \nclearances and LAR, need to be completed before the investment loan is contracted, because \nthese kinds of activity often delay disbursement of approved investment loans. Preconstruction \n                                                 \n6   Sri Lanka Road Sector Policy Review Note, 11 November 2003, proposes a specific investment loan for 2005, \ncomprising (i) deferred maintenance, rehabilitation, and upgrading of priority national highways; (ii) provision of \ncapital grants to encourage public private partnerships (PPP) on national highways, with the possibility of partial \nrisk guarantees; (iii) implementation support for the proposed road fund and other recent policy initiatives; and \n(iv) a pilot component on rural road maintenance, which would start the process of building local authorities\u2019 \ncapacity to maintain roads.  \n7   ADB. 1997.

", "4  \nactivities can be facilitated by providing road sector institutions with a financing facility to \nprepare a pipeline of projects, followed by investment loans to improve and strengthen linkages \nbetween project preparation and implementation. \n \nF.  Asian Development Bank Sector Strategy \n \n13.  Under RSDP (footnote 5), ADB and the Government agreed to a medium- and long-term \nsector development strategy, which provides a road map for overall road sector reform. ADB \nalso recently approved two TAs to prepare (i) the road sector master plan (footnote 3) and (ii) a \npublic-private partnership (PPP) expressway projects10. The first will develop the overall road \nsector investment plan and financing strategies, including PPP arrangements, and the second \naims to help the Government  develop policy and strategy framework for PPP expressway \nprojects. Based on these developments, the Government and ADB agreed to expand ADB \ninvolvement in road sector development through a sector loan approach, with possible mixed \nloans of Asian Development Fund (ADF) and ordinary capital resources (OCR), to develop \nnational highways as the Government needs assistance to accelerate economic growth and \npoverty reduction. \n \nG.  Rationale \n \n14.  In view of ADB adopting a sector loan approach, introducing mixed loans of ADF and \nOCR, and promoting private sector participation, road sector institutions need to be equipped \nwith  the  capacity  to  efficiently  carry  out  preconstruction  activities.  Successful  project \nimplementation requires timely high-quality preparation works to comply with ADB requirements \nfor  project  processing  and  to  avoid  any  delay.  A  readily  accessible  financing  facility  (the \nFacility), disbursing external and/or private sector funds, should be established to allow road \nsector institutions to efficiently conduct preconstruction activities. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \n \nA.  Objective \n15.  The objective of the TA loan is to help the Government efficiently develop the road \nnetwork. Focusing on road project preparation, the TA loan will (i) enable road sector institutions \nto conduct preconstruction on time without waiting for funds from external agencies, and (ii) \nensure readiness of the follow-on project implementation. The TA loan will also help enhance \nroad agencies\u2019 capacity to implement road projects. The TA loan is for national and provincial \nroads and expressways, including PPP projects. Appendix 2 presents the project framework. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n16.  The TA loan will provide the Facility to help  the Government (i) prepare the  Project, \nincluding feasibility studies, including environmental and social assessment, resettlement plans, \ndetailed designs, and bid documents; and (ii) evaluate bids and negotiate contracts.

The technical assistance will also include assistance in preparing \nPublic-Private  Partnership  (PPP)  policy  and  a  model  PPP  project  for  the  future  Colombo-Katunayake \nExpressway. ", "  5\nmay  also  be  extended  to  cover  the  cost  of  engaging  consultants  to  prepare  concession \nagreements and negotiations for PPP projects. \n \n17.  The Facility will be utilized for roads identified in the investment plan prepared under the \nroad  sector  master  plan  (footnote  3).  The  Facility  will  also  cover  roads  proposed  by  the \nGovernment and which ADB agrees are urgent, before and while the investment plan is \ndeveloped. The Facility will accommodate projects intended for downstream ADB financing as \nwell as for non-ADB projects. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates \n18.  The total cost of the Facility is estimated at $20 million equivalent, including interest on \nthe TA loan during implementation. The foreign exchange cost is $10.25 million and local \ncurrency cost is $9.75 million equivalent (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n \nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \nItem  Foreign  Local  Total \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nRoad Project Preparatory Facility  9.95  9.75  19.70 \nInterest during Implementation  0.30  0.00   0.30 \nTotal  10.25  9.75  20.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n19.  ADB will provide a loan of $15 million equivalent (75% of the total cost) to cover the \nentire foreign exchange cost and 48.7% of the local currency cost (Table 2). The Government \nwill finance the remaining local cost of $5 million equivalent, or 25% of the total cost, comprising \nremuneration of counterpart staff; international and local travel; equipment (computers, printers, \netc.); surveys; office accommodation; taxes and duties; and other miscellaneous costs. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nForeign  Local  Total \nItem \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nAsian Development Bank  10.25  4.75  15.00 \nGovernment   0.00   5.00   5.00 \nTotal  10.25  9.75  20.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n20.  A loan of $15 million equivalent will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, \nwith a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an annual interest rate of 1% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n ", "6  \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management and Coordination \n \n21.  A steering committee11 will be established to discuss, review, and approve the road \ndevelopment program, which consists of at least two contract packages, to be assisted by the \nFacility.  The  steering  committee  will  be  co-chaired  by  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of \nTransport, Highways, and Civil Aviation (MTHCA); and  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  Provincial \nCouncils, and Local Government (MHAPCLG). Other members will be representatives of the \nMinistry  of  Finance,  External  Resource  Department,  Ministry  of  Policy  Development  and \nImplementation (MPDI), Ministry of Highways (MOH), National Planning Department, Board of \nInvestment (BOI), RDA, Urban Development Authority, Central Environmental Authority, and \nADB. MTHCA and MHAPCLG will appoint the steering committee coordinator, who will have \nqualifications acceptable to ADB and convene and facilitate steering committee meetings.  \n \n22.  The Executing Agency (EA) for national highways and expressways, included in any \npackage, except PPP projects, will be MOH, and the Implementing Agency (IA) will be RDA. \nThe EA for provincial roads included in any package will be MHAPCLG, and IAs will be the \nprovincial  councils  where  the  steering  committee  has  approved  subprojects.  For  PPP \nexpressways, included in any packages or in stand-alone packages, the EA will be MOH, and \nthe IA will be RDA (in consultation with BOI for financial advisory services). The EAs will (i) \nsupervise IAs\u2019 work, (ii) maintain the quality of work programs, and (iii) monitor the level of \nFacility  utilization,  to  ensure  consistency  with  national  development  objectives.  IAs  will \nsupervise the consultants\u2019 work like normal TA projects. \n \n23.  MOH  will  also  work  as  the  Coordinating  Executing  Agency,  in  consultation  with \nMHAPCLG, for provincial roads included in any package. RDA and MHAPCLG will form a \ncoordinating committee comprised of provincial councils to facilitate the work of consultants and \nencourage ownership of the work at the provincial level. The Coordinating Executing Agency will \nselect and engage consultants, and consolidate project progress and report it to ADB. \n \n24.  Each EA will nominate a coordinator, acceptable to ADB, to administer the Facility. Each \nIA will have a project facilitator who will work in the coordinating committee by the time that any \nroads in its jurisdiction are included in a package. Each facilitator will have capacity to oversee \nsocial, resettlement and environmental issues as well as engineering aspects of each road in its \njurisdiction included in each package. The steering committee coordinator and each facilitator \nwill have necessary resources and facilities for implementing their respective works. Appendix 4 \nshows the TA loan organization chart. \n \n25.  The Facility will be utilized as follows (Appendix 5).  \n \n26.  Programming. The steering committee will discuss, review, and approve a medium-\nterm program for facility use. This program will include at least one package to be developed \nimmediately  (Package  I)  and  one  package  to  be  developed  after  the  steering  committee \nendorses the core network in the road sector master plan. Each package may consist of \nnational and provincial roads, and expressways (para 29). This program may also include \npackages comprised of PPP subprojects. Each package will be divided into subprojects or \ncycles so that the consultants\u2019 work program can be monitored and adjusted when necessary \n                                                 \n11   It is expected that an identical steering committee will function in the road sector master plan project at the same \ntime. ", "  7\nand to accommodate the road sector master plan. The steering committee will submit the \nproposed packages approved by it to ADB for review and approval. The format of the proposal \nis in Appendix 6. \n \n27.  Recruitment of Consultants. The Coordinating Executing Agency, in consultation with \nMHAPCLG, and with the written agreement of each provincial council with respect to roads in its \njurisdiction, will select and engage the consultants who will provide technical assistance for \neach package. This process follows the normal procedure applied to ADB-funded projects in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. ADB will review and approve \nthe processing of consultant recruitment.  \n \n28.  Supervision  of  Consultant\u2019s  Work.  The  Coordinating  Executing  agency  will  be \nresponsible for monitoring the consultants for each package, in consultation with MHAPCLG, \nRDA and provincial councils. Each IA will  provide logistical support to the consultants and \nreview  their  outputs.  The  consultant  contracts  for  each  package  may  be  extended  for \nsuccessive subprojects or cycles under the package through contract variations, subject to \nevaluation by the Steering Committee and agreement by ADB. The steering committee will \ndetermine whether such consultants will conduct the successive subprojects or cycles under the \nrelevant package contract, based on the assessment of their performance, using transparent \ncriteria notified to the consultants before work begins. When the steering committee evaluates \nthe consultants\u2019 performance as unsatisfactory, the EA reserves the right to terminate them and \nrecruit new ones for the successive cycle of work. \n \n2.  Package Selection Criteria \n \n29.  Given that it places high priority on national highway rehabilitation, the Government \nwishes to expedite the use of the Facility. Provision was made for the immediate use of the \nFacility to cover the cost of feasibility studies and engineering studies for the highest-priority \nroads. Appendix 7 shows an indicative list of high priority roads. About 200-300 km of roads, \nincluding those in Appendix 7, will be selected by the steering committee for the immediate use \nof the Facility before the road sector master plan identifies a core network12. The contract with \nthe consultant engaged for this immediate work will be extended for additional subprojects, \nwhich will become the Package I contract (para 26), subject to the consultant\u2019s performance and \nwork requirements (para 28). \n \n30.  After the steering committee endorses the core network in the road sector master plan, \nthe steering committee will select at least one package, which may consist of both national and \nprovincial roads, primarily based on the road sector master plan and approved by ADB. Those \nroads that  are or will be in ADB\u2019s country program, including subprojects under a ADB sector \nloan, will be given the highest priority for using the Facility. The steering committee may select \nPPP subprojects, primarily based on the road sector master plan or high priority roads identified \nby the Government and ADB. Roads that will be funded by other external sources will also be \nable to use the Facility. \n \n31.  Besides meeting these criteria, the Project must also be (i) economically feasible; (ii) \nenvironmentally  responsible,  e.g.,  all  impacts  should  be  mitigable,  and  an  environmental \nassessment will be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Environment Policy; and (iii) socially \nresponsible,  e.g.,  a  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \n                                                 \n12   A core network is expected to be identified by the road sector master plan in October 2004. ", "8  \nResettlement will be prepared under the Project, an assessment will be made in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  People,  and  road  safety  audits  will  be  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Road Safety Audit for Road Projects: A Operational Tool Kit (2003) or \nsimilar procedure acceptable to ADB.   \n \n32.  In addition to being economically feasible, the PPP subprojects should also clear the \ncriteria defined in the PPP policy and strategy, which will be developed under ADB TA (footnote \n11).  \n \n3.  Implementation Schedule and Period \n \n33.  Facility use is expected to start in July 2004 and implemented over 4 years. An indicative \nimplementation schedule, assuming 3 contract packages, is in Appendix 8. The indicative \nallocation of the Facility for monitoring purposes will be approximately 40% for Package I and \n30%  each  for  Packages  II  and  III,  subject  to  change  due  to  the  steering  committee\u2019s \nprogramming during and after development of the road sector master plan. \n \n4.  Procurement \n \n34.  All goods and services under the Project will be procured in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines for Procurement. The steering committee will determine the required goods and \nservices and submit the request of procurement for ADB approval. As most project procurement \nis expected to be for routine office and administrative equipment of small value and most \nefficiently acquired off the shelf, direct procurement procedures are expected to be used. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n35.  Consulting services for projects that use the Facility may include (i) preparing feasibility \nstudies; (ii) preparing detailed design; and (iii) assisting procurement, which includes (a) bid \ndocument preparation and evaluation; (b) bid processing; and (c) contract negotiations for \nselecting civil works contractors, supervision consultants, and equipment vendors. For privately \nfinanced projects, consulting services will be extended to development of financing structures \nand  concession  agreements,  and  to  contract  negotiation  with  the  private  sector  entity. \nConsultants will also help prepare the environmental and social assessment and resettlement \nplan within the feasibility study for each road. Appendix 9 provides an example outline TOR for \na combined feasibility study and engineering study, including procurement assistance and \nresettlement planning, for national highway projects. These TOR will be applicable to all type of \nroads. Appendix 10 provides an example outline TOR for PPP arrangements. \n \n36.  Specialists are  typically required to have expertise in highway engineering; transport \neconomics; transport finance; and social issues, resettlement, environment, and law. These \nspecialists  are  necessary  to  help  IAs  carry  out  comprehensive  feasibility  analysis  and \nengineering design, prepare bid documents, and help in procurement satisfactory to ADB. The \ndetailed TOR of the consultants for a proposed project, and the associated resources to fulfill \nthe TOR, will be developed by each EA before it submits the proposal to the steering committee \nand then to ADB for review and approval. \n \n37.  The consultants will be firms of international consultants in association with domestic \nconsultants. Individual international and domestic consultants will also be engaged for any tasks \nrequired, independently or in combination with consulting firms. Firms will mainly be responsible \nfor engineering; institutional assessment; study of technical, economic, and financial feasibility ", "  9\nof road projects; overall coordination of the consulting services; and bid assistance. Individual \nconsultants  will  mainly  prepare  the  poverty  and  social  assessment,  resettlement  plan, \nindigenous people\u2019s development plan (if required), environmental and social assessment, and \npoverty impact study. Individual consultants may also be engaged to expedite resettlement \nprocessing.  Either  firms  or  individual  consultants  will  be  engaged  for  PPP  project  tasks, \ndepending on their nature. \n \n38.  The consulting firm will be engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedures. The individual consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of \ndomestic consultants.  \n \n39.  The outline TOR in Appendix 9 will be suitable for the immediate output within the \nPackage I contract. On the basis of the scope of study for 200-300km roads, about 50 and 60 \nperson-months of international and domestic consulting services, respectively, are estimated as \nrequired for 1 year starting in 2004. About $2 million equivalent (10% of the Facility) from the TA \nloan will be used for this. Immediate use of the TA loan requires (i) prompt agreement on the \nroads to be covered; (ii) finalization of terms of reference for consulting services, which include \nfeasibility and engineering studies; and (iii) timely appointment of the consultants.  Tentative \nestimates for the whole TA loan are approximately 500 and 600 person-months of international \nand  domestic  consulting  services,  respectively.  ADB  has  approved  advance  action  for \nrecruitment of consultants, without committing approval of the Project or financing of the action. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangement \n \n40.  Loan disbursement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2001), as amended from time to time, and detailed arrangements between the Government \nand ADB. The loan proceeds will be disbursed directly to the consultants based on approved \ncontracts  under  the  direct  payment  procedure.  A  signed  withdrawal  application  must  be \nsubmitted by the Coordinating Executing Agency to ADB together with the consultant's claim or \ninvoice. Part of the administration costs will be disbursed under reimbursement procedure. Any \nindividual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the statement of expenditure method \nfor reimbursement of certain eligible expenditures will not exceed the equivalent of $50,000. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n41.  Each EA will monitor and evaluate project performance in accordance with the project \nframework in Appendix 1. Primary monitoring indicators to be used by the EA and reported to \nADB  will  be  (i)  number  of  days  from  between  loan  effectiveness  and  the  recruitment  of \nconsultants; (ii) number of days between loan effectiveness of a follow-on loan and issuance of \nbid documents for civil works; (iii) duration of processing the bid from bid document preparation \nto contract closure  with civil work contractors for the follow-on  loan;  and  (iv)  incidence  of \ndisputes of environmental, social and resettlement issues. The target for each indicator is \nindicated in the project framework.  \n \n8.  Reports \n \n42.  The steering committee will monitor project execution to provide a basis to identify the \nnext  program  of  road  development.  Monthly  progress  reports  on  project  implementation \nsubmitted by IAs will be consolidated by the Coordinating Executing agency. The reports will \nindicate,  among  other  things,  (i)  progress  made  against  established  targets;  (ii)  problems ", "10  \nencountered and remedial actions taken or proposed to resolve the problems; and (iii) proposed \nproject activities to be undertaken and progress expected during the succeeding 6-month \nperiod, including detailed contract awards and disbursement projections. \n \n43.  The progress report will include sufficient information in summary form. The purpose of \nthe report is to enable the Government, the steering committee, EA, and ADB to monitor the \nlatest progress, become aware of problems, and assess whether the Project\u2019s immediate \nobjectives  are  being  met.  Consultants  are  preparing  more  detailed  reports  for  the  EA\u2019s \nmanagement and for use during review missions, including midterm and project completion \nreview missions. The progress report will contain an executive summary of the detailed reports, \nwith format and content permitting ADB staff to readily capture key information for inputting into \nthe project performance report, the main tool for monitoring project implementation performance \nwithin ADB. \n \n44.  Within 3 months of complete disbursement of the TA loan, each EA will prepare a project \ncompletion report on the execution of the Facility established under the TA loan. The report will \nevaluate how effectively the Facility has helped IAs and the Government realize national \ndevelopment objectives. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n45.  ADB  will  conduct  annual  reviews  of  Facility  use,  IAs,  and  projects  to  respond  to \nsignificant fund underutilization, approval of any additional IAs, and need for fund reallocation. A \nmidterm project review will also be carried out around June 2006 to assess the overall progress \nin project implementation and achievements. \n \n10.  Accounts and Audit \n \n46.  The IAs will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify financing \nresources received and expenditures made on the TA loan, including the goods, works, and \nservices financed out of the loan proceeds and local funds. These TA loan accounts and related \nfinancial statements will be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by \nauditors acceptable to ADB. The Government will submit annual audited reports and related \nfinancial statements to ADB within 9 months after the end of each fiscal year. \n \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \n \n47.  The  Facility  will  ensure  that  (i)  follow-on  projects  will  be  implemented  without \nunnecessary delay, (ii) development impact of the follow-on investment projects will materialize \nwithout delay, and (iii) the Government will minimize unnecessary commitment charges of the \nfollow-on loans in case of OCR. \n \n48.  The Facility will support efficient development of roads and thereby contribute to national \neconomic  development  and  poverty  reduction.  The  Facility  will  provide  roads  without \nunnecessary delay, and benefit road users by enabling them to undertake economic activities \nefficiently. The Facility will also improve the ownership in developing roads, strengthen IAs' \nproject  preparation  capacity  to  international  standards  and  improve  governance  and \ntransparency in consultant selection and procurement. \n ", " 11\n49.  The risk of not coordinating Facility use with follow-on projects will be addressed by the \ndecision-making mechanism through the steering committee, involving all agencies relating to \nroad development. The steering committee will determine the road development program, \nconsisting of several road projects that will use the Facility and provide the appropriate level of \nFacility use to avoid the risk of overloading IAs and domestic consultants. An identical steering \ncommittee will function in the road sector master plan TA project at the same time. This \narrangement also secures funding agency coordination on a pipeline of road projects  in the \ncountry. The Government has agreed to nominate a steering committee coordinator before loan \nnegotiations so that the steering committee can operate effectively. \n \n50.  The  risk  of  implementation  delay  will  be  mitigated  by  close  ADB  supervision  of \nimplementation. ADB will be involved in the steering committee, which will have authority to \ndecide on Facility use. ADB will also guide EAs and IAs in preparing proposals for Facility use to \nensure implementation quality13. To avoid delays in engaging consultants for immediate Facility \nuse, the Government has agreed to (i) establish the steering committee and nominate its \ncoordinator, (ii) nominate EA coordinators, (iii) appoint a facilitator at RDA, and (iv) prepare at \nleast one subproject for immediate financing under the Facility. ADB provided the Government \nwith the outline TOR to help the EA and IA prepare the proposal. Consultant engagement, and \nprocurement will also follow ADB guidelines to ensure transparent and competitive processes. \n \n51.  The Facility is expected to ensure development of environmentally and socially viable \nprojects (Appendix 11). Projects under follow-on loans will be prepared in compliance with \ngovernment and ADB environmental assessment guidelines, regulations, and policies. The \nFacility is not expected to have any adverse environmental consequences due to the nature of \nproject preparation. Environmental impacts relating to follow-on loans will be examined and \nmitigated  in  accordance  with  government  and  ADB  environmental  assessment  guidelines, \nregulations, and policies. \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n52.  Besides the standard assurances, the Government has given the following assurances, \nwhich are incorporated in the legal documents:   \n(i)  Detailed TOR for the consultants will be presented in each approved packages. \nThe  steering  committee  will  ensure  that  the  TOR  for  consultants  will  be \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  in  the  outline  TOR  attached  as \nAppendixes 9 and 10. \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that all projects will be prepared in accordance with \n(a)  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  regulations  and  policy,  and  (b)  ADB's \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and ADB\u2019s  Environmental Assessment Guidelines \n(2003). \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that a resettlement plan is prepared under each \npackage for each road project in accordance with the Government\u2019s laws and \nregulations such as the National Involuntary Resettlement Policy, ADB\u2019s Policy \n                                                 \n13   For provincial roads, ongoing provincial road development projects funded by ADB and JBIC have also been \nhelping selected provincial councils build their capacity to undertake preconstruction.  ", "12  \non  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on \nResettlement:  A  Guide  to  Good  Practice  (1998),  and  that  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1999) is implemented. \n(iv)  The Government will undertake road safety audits for all subprojects and ensure \nthat these audits are conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Road Safety Audit for \nRoad Projects: An Operational Tool Kit (2003) or similar procedure acceptable to \nADB. \n(v)  Each  IA  will  appoint  a  competent  facilitator,  with  social,  resettlement, \nenvironmental, and engineering capacity, acceptable to ADB by the time that any \nroads in its jurisdiction are included in a package.  \n(vi)  Each EA and IA will provide adequate resources and facilities to implement the \nprojects effectively. \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that each IA (other than RDA, which will have \nentered into the project agreement) and each PPP company will, at the time of or \nprior to the steering committee approving a package which includes roads in the \nrelevant  province  or  PPP  projects,  submit  to  it  and  ADB  an  undertaking, \nacceptable to ADB, to follow the terms of the Facility and the Loan Agreement. \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n \n53.   The following are conditions for loan effectiveness:  \n(i)  The steering committee will have approved, with ADB\u2019s concurrence, at least one \npackage for immediate financing under the Facility. \n(ii)  RDA will have entered into a project agreement with ADB. \n \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n \n54.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 10,135,000 to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \nRoad Project Preparatory Facility from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge \nat the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n \n16 March 2004", "Appendix 1  13 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ROAD SECTOR \nTable A1.1: Projects \nSource of Funds  Project  Loan/Grant  Amount  Expected \n(Currency)   (million)  Completion \n         \nADB  Third Road Improvement  Loan ($)  55.0  2004 \n  Southern Provincial Roads Improvement  Loan ($)  30.0  2004 \n  Road Network Improvement  Loan ($)  80.0  2005 \n  Southern Transport Development  Loan ($)  90.0  2007 \n  Southern Province Rural Economic Advancement  Loan ($)  10.0  2007 \n  Road Sector Development  Loan ($)  65.0a  2007 \n  Conflict Affected Areas Rehabilitation  Loan ($)  107.9b  2007 \n       \nJapan  Baseline Roads  Loan (\u00a5 )   5,137.0  2003 \n  Baseline Roads II  Loan (\u00a5 )   2,342.0  2003 \n  Road Network Improvement  Loan (\u00a5 )   3,078.0  2006 \n  Southern Transport Development  Loan (\u00a5 )   18,770.0  2007 \n  Reconstruction of Gampola and Muwagama  Grant (\u00a5 )   1,497.0  2004 \n  Bridges     \n  Friendship Bridge  Grant  (\u00a5 )  2001 \n         \nKorea  Ratnapura-Bandarawela Road   Loan (W)  24,512.0  2005 \n         \nKuwait  Bridges Reconstruction and Rehabilitation  Loan (KWD)  3,300.0  2006 \n \nNDF   Southern Transport Development  Loan (USD)  6.7  2007 \n         \nSweden  Southern Transport Development  Grant (USD)  1.0  2007 \n       \nNorway  Rehabilitation of Rural Roads in the Southern  Grant  2004 \nRegion   \nADB=Asian Development Bank, KWD= Kuwait Dollar, NDF=Nordic Development Fund. \na  Including $8.5 million from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund. \nb  Including $46.2 million of road rehabilitation component.  \nSource: Draft Concept Paper\u2013Road Sector, November 2003. \n \nTable A1.2: Technical Assistance \nSource of Funds  Technical Assistance  Loan/Grant  Amount  Period \n(Currency)   (million) \n         \nADB  Road Network Improvement  Grant (USD)  0.700  1994/95 \n  Road Safety Study  Grant (USD)  0.800  1994/95 \n  Quarry Industry Study  Grant (USD)  0.430  1994/95 \n  Southern Provincial Roads Improvement  Grant (USD)  0.600  1995/96 \n  Contract Award Procedures  Grant (USD)  0.100  1995/96 \n  Southern Transport Corridor  Grant (USD)  1.000  1997/98 \n  Second Provincial Roads Improvement  Grant (USD)  1.000  1997/98 \n  Re-engineering of Road Sector Institution  Grant (USD)  0.640  1999/00 \n  Preparation of STDP  Grant (USD)  0.150  1999/00 \n  Road Maintenance Budgeting and Expenditure Control  Grant (USD)  0.150  2001/02 \n  Transport Sector Capacity Building  Grant (USD)  0.056  2001 \nJapan  Engineering Services for the Southern Highway  Loan (Yen)  381.000  1999/00 \nSweden  Colombo \u2013 Kandy Expressway  Grant (USD)  0.300  2000/01 \nUNDP  Transport Sector Strategy Study  Grant (USD)  0.540  1995/96 \nMid Country Rural Roads Network  Grant (USD)  0.547  2000/01 \nWorld   Transport Sector Strategy Study  Loan (USD)  0.570  1995/96 \nBank \n  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, STDP = Southern Transport Development Project, UNDP = United Nations \nDevelopment Programme. \nSource: Draft Concept Paper\u2013Road Sector, November 2003.

Introduction  \n1.  The  assistance  will  help  the  Implementing  Agency  prepare  the  proposed  national \nhighway project. Its objectives are to (i) reduce the costs incurred by users of the road network \nby improving important sections of it, (ii) increase the life of other road sections by appropriate \nperiodic maintenance, and (iii) continue developing the domestic road-contracting industry. \n2.  The Coordinating Executing Agency will engage qualified international consultants who, \nin association with domestic consultants, will undertake the tasks set out in these terms of \nreference (TOR). The consultants will be selected in accordance with Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB on the \nrecruitment of domestic consultants. \n3.  The following tasks (para. 6) describe one subproject or work cycle for immediate \noutputs, assuming national highways, which may be extended to one contract package for \nadditional work requirements, subject to consultant\u2019s performance. With minor modifications, the \nTOR could be used for successive subprojects or work cycles and all types of roads.  \n4.  In this example TOR, the screening study (para. 7) relates specifically to the immediate \nuse of the TA Loan. In subsequent subprojects within this initial contract package and the \nfollowing packages, a screening study might not be necessary because road projects will be \nprioritized once the road sector master plan is completed.  \n5.  The  steering  committee  will  determine  whether  the  consultant  will  continue  the \nsubprogram contract for the successive cycle, based on the assessment of the consultant\u2019s \nperformance.  \nB.   Scope of the Technical Assistance \n6.  The assistance will be implemented in two phases. The first, for preparatory studies, and \nthe second, for preconstruction activities, will be divided into two parts.  \n1.  Phase 1: Preparatory Study  \na.  Screening Study  \n \n7.  The consultants will select potential project roads in consultation with the coordinating \ncommittee by doing the following:  \n(i)  Review studies of road projects and other social and economic development \nprojects  recently  completed  or  under  way  in  Sri  Lanka  to  understand \ndevelopment initiatives relevant to the Project, especially in the road sector, and \nhelp forecast traffic growth.  ", "24   Appendix 9 \n(ii)  Review surveys and data (e.g., traffic and roughness) relating to the long list of \npossible candidate road improvements proposed by RDA (about 500 kilometers \n[km]),  including  those  requiring  substantial  improvement  and  deferred \nmaintenance.  \n(iii)  The screening study will review those roads, taking into account their role in \nmeeting  the  country\u2019s  development  objectives,  and  in  serving  areas  where \nunemployment and poverty are significant. The screening process will also take \ninto  account  traffic  volume,  pavement  conditions,  safety  and  environmental \nconsiderations, and the costs and benefits of the improvements, e.g., with use of \nbenefit-cost ratios. \n(iv)  The output of the screening will be a list of roads that need to be studied further, \nconsisting of about 200\u2013300 km that require substantial improvements. The list \nwill be considered by RDA, ADB, and the consultants at a tripartite meeting. The \nfinal list will become the basis for the subsequent feasibility study.  \nb.  Feasibility Study \n \n8.

Brief progress reports will be prepared and submitted by the consultants within 10 days \nof the end of the reporting month. These reports will be based on the implementation schedule \nagreed on with the consultant during the inception period and will detail variations from the \nschedule and how they are to be addressed. The reports will also identify matters that may \ndelay or impact on project objectives, and set out how they are to be addressed. \nD.  Consultants \n24.  On the basis of the scope of work, about 50 and 60 person-months of international and \ndomestic consulting services, respectively, are estimated to be required. Expertise required \nincludes highway and pavement engineering, transport economics, and structural engineering. \nThe requirement for senior domestic consultants, in broadly similar fields, is estimated to be the \nsame. Other domestic consultants\u2019 personnel will be required for technical and other aspects of \nthe TA, particularly traffic, roughness, and other surveys such as social and environmental \nstudies.  However,  consultants  are  at  liberty  to  propose  alternative  staffing  arrangements, \nwithout significant change in the international inputs, to achieve the TA objectives.  \nE.  Implementation Arrangements  \n25.  Within RDA, the director for contract management will be responsible for managing the \nTA, assign a senior officer to provide day-to-day liaison and assistance to the consultants, and \narrange for them to be provided with necessary information and facilities. \nF.

Background \n \n1.  Tasks relating to Public Private partnership (PPP) must be based on the Government\u2019s \nPPP  policy  and  strategy,  and  a  model  concession  agreement,  developed  in  a  technical \nassistance.1 . \n \n2.  The PPP package should be developed in consideration of the following five aspects:  \n \n(i)  Physical packaging will be primarily determined by the coordinating, which will \nprepare the detailed design report. To make the PPP subproject attractive to the \nprivate sector, the physical packages may sometimes need to be modified (for \ninstance, the combination of \u201cbrown field\u201d and \u201cgreen field\u201d investments or a \ndecision on whether the construction of a major bridge is to be included in the \nPPP package). The financial and legal advisor should develop recommendations \non these aspects to RDA in finalizing the physical package. \n \n(ii)  Strategic packaging largely pertains to tolling strategy, traffic count, tolling \ntechnology selection, and optimization modeling. Tolling strategy, traffic count, \ntolling technology selection, and optimization modeling needs to be reviewed by \nthe financial and legal advisor. \n \n(iii)  Investment  packaging  essentially  entails  selecting  the  best  PPP  scheme. \nPossible options for the PPP scheme include (i) annuity-based Build Operate \nTransfer  (BOT)  concession;  (ii)  modified  version  of  the  annuity-based  BOT \nscheme with partial transfer of commercial risk to the private sector within the \nframework of the current annuity-based BOT model  agreement; (iii) special-\npurpose  vehicle;  (iv)  combination  of  \u201cgreen  field  and  brown  field\u201d  BOT \nconcession; (v) toll-based BOT with a grant provided to the concessionaire to \ncover a substantial part of the initial capital cost; and (vi) toll-based BOT with no \nor little grant. Based on this exercise, the financial and legal advisor would \nformulate investment proposition.  \n \n(iv)  Process packaging will be carried out in MOH\u2019s selection of a concessionaire \nthrough bidding. A key task is to structure the concession agreement, including \nthe period of concession and the way to provide subsidies to contractors, and to \ndevelop bidding documents, including concession agreement together with the \nselection criteria of bidders. The financial and legal advisor will assist MOH and \nthe bid evaluation teams.  \n \n3.  While the extent of involvement by the financial advisor will differ from stage to stage, \nthe scope of the work for the financial advisor is defined in the next section.  \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003.

A financial advisor will be retained to develop an effective concession agreement for the \ndesignated sections of the Project. The objective of this advisory service is to produce a \nfinancially  viable  concession  to  address  the  principal  issues  related  to  project  risks  and \nadequate returns to the concessionaire. \n \n5.  The advisory services will involve the following activities:  \n \n(i)  Physical packaging stage. The financial and legal advisor will examine the \noverall viability of packaging, considering all aspects associated with the design \nstandards, environmental and social aspects, and location of alternative roads \nand service roads.  \n \n(ii)  Strategic Packaging Stage. The financial and legal advisor will do the following: \n \n(a)  Review the results of consultants\u2019 traffic counts.  \n(b)  Develop tolling options to ensure that the use and placement of barrier \nand exit tolling stations are to achieve a reasonable level of capture of \ntraffic using the road. \n(c)  Examine the impacts of the tolling at each station to determine the likely \nimpact on diversion. \n(d)  Revise the estimate of toll revenues during the concession. \n(e)  Conduct risk assessment by reviewing the allocation of risks under the \nmodel concession agreements, and proposing changes in risk allocation \nto make the concessions more attractive to the private sector without \nsignificantly increasing the liabilities of MOH. \n(f)  Develop  a  conceptual  framework  to  design  a  bidding  package, \nconsidering  a  variety  of  specific  factors,  including  requirements  for \nperiodic maintenance based on performance parameters, and terms for \nearly termination. \n \n(iii)  Investment  Packaging  Stage.  The  financial  and  legal  advisor  will  do  the \nfollowing: \n \n(a)  Finalize the selection of scheme among the possible PPP schemes. \n(b)  Prepare an investment proposition.  \n(c)  Develop a project information memorandum, project financial plan, project \nrisk allocation structures, and possible government support strategies. \n \n(iv)  Process packaging stage. The financial and legal advisor will do the following: \n \n(a)  Review  and  modify  the  draft  concession  documents  to  provide  a \nconcession that is effective and not likely to require capital subsidy. \n(b)  Hold  informal  meetings  with  financiers,  contractors,  and  government \nofficials to obtain their reaction to the proposed concession framework, \nand further revise the concession documents.  \n(c)  Conduct a series of workshops for investors, particularly contractors and \nfinanciers, to generate interest in the PPP component. \n(d)  Develop a strategy for negotiation with the contractor.  \n ", "    Appendix 10  33\nC.  Qualification \n \n6.  A financial and legal advisor has worked with the Government and is familiar with the \nrequirements  for  PSP-based  road  projects  from  the  perspective  of the Government and \ninvestors. The financial and legal advisor must be familiar with the investment environment and \nregulations in South Asia Region.  \n \n7.  Board of Investment (BOI) will engage the financial advisor with loan proceeds in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB on the selection and engagement of domestic consultants.
