The Project will also help strengthen the country\u2019s\ncapacity to manage the decentralized education system.\nClassification Poverty intervention\nThematic: Human development/gender and development\nEnvironmental Category  C.  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed,  and  no\nAssessment significant adverse environmental impacts identified.\nRationale A population educated to a basic level of literacy and numeracy is\nessential to promote socioeconomic progress and promote poverty\nreduction. Education in the Lao PDR has been improving, but still has\nmany  limitations.  Much  remains  to  be  done  to  achieve  the\nGovernment\u2019s target of universal primary education, and raise the\nquality of education to standards in neighboring countries. Very low\npublic  expenditure  on  education  has  been  a  major  constraint  to\nensuring continued, balanced growth in the education system, which\nis  characterized  by  inequitable  access  to  quality  basic  education,\nespecially primary education for the poor, girls, and ethnic minorities,\nand weak capacity to manage the system.\nThe Government\u2019s policy priority for education is to raise the quality\nand enhance the relevance of both primary and secondary education\nand to increase participation in education, particularly of girls and\nethnic minorities. Improving the quality of teaching competency and\nthe  learning  environment  is  key  to  better  quality  education  and\nretaining more children in schools. In particular, competent teachers\nshould be encouraged to remain in the profession with enhanced\ncareer  development  prospects.  About  16,300  of  27,600  primary\nschool teachers have less than the current qualification to teach. Of\nthese  16,300,  about  6,400  teachers  in  primary  education  are\nunqualified  and  have  no  teacher  training  at  all,  and  about  9,900\nteachers  are  underqualified.  At  the  lower  secondary  level,  about\n5,450 of 9,800 teachers are either unqualified or underqualified, and\nonly  about  30  percent  have  adequate  preservice  teacher  training\noffered at eight teacher training colleges (TTCs) in the country. The\nProject will develop a national teacher training support system, and\nimplement intensive teacher training programs in selected provinces\nand  districts.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  increased  access  to\nprimary  education  in  selected  underserved  areas  by  encouraging\nparticipation of students and support from communities, by providing\ntrained  teachers  on  a  sustainable  basis,  and  hence  by  ensuring\nquality  of  the  education  provided  in  the  schools.  The  Project  will\nespecially target the underserved ethnic minority areas where gender", "iii\ndisparities in access to and retention in education are large. The\nProject  will  also  support  the  Government\u2019s  plan  to  decentralize\neducation  management  by  providing  assistance  to  develop\ninstitutional, management, and project implementation capabilities at\nthe central, provincial, district, and village levels.\nObjectives and The long term goal of the Project is to contribute to poverty reduction\nScope in the Lao PDR by helping the Government achieve quality education\nfor all children. In the medium term, the overall project objectives are\nto (i) improve the relevance, quality, and efficiency of primary and\nsecondary  education  by  developing  a  teacher  training  support\nsystem, developing a strategy to increase the number of female and\nethnic  minority  teachers,  enhancing  the  professional  status  and\ncareer  development  prospects  of  teachers,  constructing  and\nupgrading training facilities, and delivering intensive teacher training\nprograms at the provincial and district levels; (ii) expand access to\nand improve retention in primary schools especially of girls and ethnic\nminority children in the poor, underserved areas of the country; and\n(iii) strengthen the institutional capacity of central, provincial, district,\nand  village  level  administrations  to  plan  and  manage  the\ndecentralized education system and implement the Project.\nThe  Project  will  develop  the  teacher  education  support  system\nincluding schemes to enhance career development prospects and\nwelfare of teachers. The Project will operate at the provincial and\ndistrict levels in selected provinces and districts to deliver integrated\npackages of activities to improve the quality of teaching and learning,\nand  access  to  and  participation  in  education.  These  integrated\npackages  include  (i)  in-service  teacher  training  and  upgrading  of\nuntrained teachers; (ii) school construction and rehabilitation; (iii) funds\nto  support  school  operation  and  maintenance,  finance  activities  to\nenhance learning in early grade classes and participation in education,\nand purchase books and learning materials.\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project is estimated at $37.6 million equivalent,\nincluding  taxes  and  duties,  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and\ninterest charge on the loan. The foreign exchange cost is estimated at\n$13.2 million, or 35 percent of the total cost, and the local currency\ncost at $24.4 million equivalent, or 65 percent.\nFinancing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percent\nADB 8.4 11.6 20.0 53\nSida 4.8 4.8 9.6 26\nGovernment and  - 8.0 8.0 21\nCommunities\nTotal 13.2 24.4 37.6 100\nADB  =  Asian  Development  Bank,  Sida  =  Swedish  International  Development\nCooperation Agency.", "iv\nLoan Amount The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a loan of $20 million\nand Terms equivalent from its Special Funds resources, with a term of 32 years,\nincluding a grace period of 8 years and an interest charge of 1.0\npercent  per  annum  during  the  grace  period,  and  1.5  percent\nthereafter.  The  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation\nAgency (Sida) is expected to provide a parallel grant of about $9.6\nmillion to cofinance the Project.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2008\nExecuting Agency Ministry of Education (MOE)\nImplementation MOE  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  Project  coordination  and\nArrangements implementation. An MOE steering committee will be responsible for\noverseeing  project  implementation.  A  project  implementation  unit\n(PIU)  will  be  established  within  MOE  to  implement  the  Project\nincluding teacher training, development programs, and other project\nactivities. The provincial PIUs (PPIUs) and the district PIUs (DPIUs)\nwill be set up in the provincial education services (PESs) and the\ndistrict  education  bureaus  (DEBs)  to  coordinate,  plan,  implement,\nmonitor and supervise, and report on project activities at the these\nlevels. The PIU will also coordinate with its provincial and district\ncounterparts.\nProcurement All ADB-financed procurement for the Project will be in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Each contract for supply of\ngoods, equipment, and materials estimated to cost $500,000 or more\nwill  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive  bidding\nprocedures, while contract packages of less than $500,000 equivalent\nwill  follow  international  shopping  procedures.  Contracts  less  than\n$100,000 may be procured on a direct purchase basis. Civil works\ncontracts that are small and situated in remote areas are not likely to\nattract the interest of international contractors. Therefore, civil work\ncontracts less than $1.0 million will be awarded on the basis of local\ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. However, if any\npackage  is  estimated  to  cost  $1.0  million  or  more,  international\ncompetitive bidding procedures will be followed. For minor civil works\nto improve school buildings and facilities to be carried out by local\ncommunities  costing  less  than  $10,000  equivalent  per  school,\nappropriate  procedures  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  community\nparticipation in procurement will be implemented.\nConsulting About  205  person-months  of  international  consulting  (47  person-\nServices months financed by ADB and 158 person-months by Sida), and 1,671\nperson-months  of  domestic  consulting  (1,512  person-months\nfinanced by ADB and 159 person-months by Sida) will be engaged to\nsupport capacity building at the MOE technical departments, PESs,\nand DEBs involved in Project activities. Local contract staff will be\nengaged  for  a  total  of  1,014  person-months  to  support  project\nimplementation  (678  person-months  financed  by  ADB  and  336\nperson-months  by  Sida).

This covers 55 percent of primary school teachers and\n30 percent of secondary school teachers in the country. In addition, a\ntotal of 365 TTC trainers, 108 teacher-upgrading program trainers,\n473 primary school pedagogical advisers, and 144 secondary school\npedagogical advisers will be trained on a regular and repeated basis.\nThis will in turn ensure the quality of the preservice, upgrading, and\nin-service training programs. TTC management staff will be given\ntraining  and  on-the-job  support  by  consultants  to  enable  them  to\nmanage their colleges more effectively and efficiently.\nThe Project will increase the opportunity for children in 41 districts in\nfour provinces to receive a full five-year primary education by building\napproximately 45 classrooms in each district. The Project will also\nensure  that  more  children  finish  primary  education  of  reasonable\nquality than now by providing teacher training programs. More than\n400,000  primary  students  will  be  studying  in  the  project-assisted\nschools by the end of the Project, of whom about 30,000 will be in\nnewly constructed or newly completed primary schools. In addition, in\n29 districts where teacher training alone will be implemented, another\n150,000 primary and secondary students will benefit from improved\neducation quality. Girls and ethnic minority children will especially\nbenefit both through geographical targeting and special assistance\nprovided by the Project. The Project will ensure that the education\nsystem becomes more responsive to local needs. Project inputs will\nbe made to strengthen the management capacity of MOE, PESs, and\nDEBs. Staff of MOE, PESs, and DEBs will be given considerable\ntraining in data collection, planning, implementation, monitoring and\nsupervising, and reporting of project activities.", "iv", "I.  PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for the Second Education Quality\nImprovement Project.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) initiated support for the education system of the\nLao PDR with an education sector study in 1989.1 Subsequently, ADB has provided three loans\nto the sector.2 ADB continued its sector and investment planning support in 1998 by helping the\nGovernment prepare the five-year (2001-2005) Education Sector Development Plan (ESDP).3 In\npursuing the recommendations of the ESDP, the Government asked ADB to provide a loan to\nfinance the proposed Second Education Quality Improvement Project. A project preparatory\ntechnical assistance (TA) for the Project was implemented from August 2000 to February 2001.4\nA joint fact-finding mission by ADB and the Swedish International Development Cooperation\nAgency (Sida) was undertaken from 26 March to 11 April 2001.5 An appraisal mission was\nfielded from 4 to 15 June 2001.6 This report is based on Government inputs, the ESDP, the TA\nreport, and the agreements reached during the loan fact-finding and appraisal missions. To\nreach a consensus on the project design, consultations and coordination were held throughout\nthe project processing period with Government officials in the Ministry of Education (MOE) and\nother  relevant  ministries,  officials  at  provincial  and  district  levels,  multilateral  and  bilateral\nassistance agencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), such as the Lao Women\u2019s Union\n(LWU) and Lao Front for National Construction, and other stakeholders including community\nmembers,  school  principals,  teachers,  parents,  and  students.  The  project  framework  is  in\nAppendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n1.  Socioeconomic Context and Poverty Issues\n3. The total population of the Lao PDR, estimated to be 4.95 million in 1998, is growing at\nan  annual  rate  of  2.8  percent.  The  country  is  truly  multiethnic,  with  49  ethnic  groups.\nGeographically, the Lao PDR is a rural and often isolated society with still limited infrastructure.\nOnly 17 percent of the population live in urban areas. Most (81 percent) rural villages are\nwithout electricity and only 9 percent have regular access to market. Forty-one percent of the\nvillages are located more than 6 kilometers from a main road; only 44 percent can be reached\n                  \n1 TA 1130-LAO: Education Sector Study, for $380,000, approved on 14 February 1989.\n2 Loan 1103-LAO: Education Quality Improvement Project, for $13.3 million, approved on 26 September 1991 and\nclosed in December 1998; Loan 1374-LAO: Postsecondary Education Rationalization Project, for $20.0 million,\napproved on 19 September 1995; and Loan 1621-LAO: Basic Education (Girls) Project, for $20.0 million, approved\non 25 June 1998.\n3 TA 3014-LAO: Education Sector Development Plan, for $530,000, approved on 7 May 1998.\n4 TA 3294-LAO: Second Education Quality Improvement Project, for $600,000, approved on 10 November 1999.\n5 The Mission comprised: Y.

Agriculture contributes\nover 50 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and is the occupation of a large part of the\nworkforce.\n4. In 1986, the Government began to transform the economy from a centrally planned to a\nmarket-oriented system. The adoption of the New Economic Mechanism in 1986 promoted less\ndirect  state  involvement  in  the  economy  and  encouraged  greater  reliance  on  market\nmechanisms. Structural reforms have taken place so that market forces are now at work in most\nsegments of the economy. Initially, the economy performed quite well, with real GDP growing\nannually at 5 to 8 percent during 1992-1997; the service and industry sectors were the largest\ncontributors  to  GDP  growth.  However,  in  1997,  economic  conditions  began  to  deteriorate,\nlargely  because  of  the  regional  economic  crisis.  In  1998  and  well  into  1999,  conditions\ncontinued to deteriorate: new investments fell drastically; tax receipts, in terms of the purchasing\npower of the kip, declined substantially. In early 2000, the value of the kip against the dollar was\nonly 15 percent of what it had been in 1996/97. The real economy such as agriculture was not\nso affected by the crisis, but growth in services and industry slowed considerably. At present,\nthe economy seems to have stabilized and inflation has slowed to a manageable level. The\neconomy is expected to regain previously reached rates of growth.\n5. The country can be best described as a subsistence society in which members of each\nhousehold usually carry out several activities to make a living. Based on data from the 1997/98\nLao expenditure and consumption survey II, a recent ADB-Lao PDR joint study estimates the\naverage total (food and nonfood) poverty line to equal KN19,184 per person per month in\n1997/98 prices.7 Using this poverty line, the aggregate poverty incidence is estimated at 38.6\npercent (down from 45 percent in 1992/93). The highest incidence of poverty is in the Northern\nRegion at 52.5 percent, followed by the Southern Region at 38.4 percent and Central Region at\n34.9 percent. The country as a whole is poor because of its limited ability to develop its\nresources and low levels of labor productivity. The distribution of the low base national income\nis quite even by international standards. However, the degree of inequality is increasing. While\nstrict causality analysis is difficult, inequality in basic education opportunities is contributing\nsignificantly to the growing inequality. Indeed, the country is in danger of falling into a poverty\ntrap  because  of  disparities  in  access  to  education  and  in  the  quality  of  education  that  is\navailable.\n6. Over 37 percent of females and 22 percent of males have no formal education. Lack of\neducation seriously limits the advancement of women and hence inhibits family planning, child\ncare, and basic health care in the family. The high illiteracy rate for women, estimated at 52\npercent compared with 27 percent for men (for the 15 and older population), is a significant\nfactor causing the poor social indicators, especially the high rates of maternal mortality and\nmortality for children under five years old. The gender gap in education is also significant among\nethnic minorities, for example, among the Hmong-Yao with the female illiteracy rate at about 92\npercent.8 The first step to address the needs of the vast majority of people for literacy and\nnumeracy is to provide complete primary education. This is a great challenge: getting more\nchildren into primary education, helping children stay in school and successfully learn their\nlessons, and providing them with primary schools offering all five grades so that they can\ncomplete primary education. Meeting this challenge will require significant resources and a\ngreat deal of effort to provide enough complete schools and the appropriate teaching and school\nresources.  Moreover,  the  poorer  provinces  lack  textbooks  and  access  to  better-qualified\nteachers.  As  a  result,  students  in  these  provinces  have  lower  student  performance  rates,\nalongside higher dropout and lower enrollment rates.\n                  \n7 Kakwani, Nanak, Bounthavy Sisouphanhthong, Phonesaly Souksavath, and Brent Dark. , 2001., Poverty in Lao\nPDR., Aa paper presented at Asia and Pacific Forum on Poverty, Manila.\n8 National Statistical Center. 1996. Lao Census 1995. Vientiane.", "3\n2. Education System, Administration, and Financing\n7. The  education  system  consists  of  preschool  (ages  of  3-5),  five  years  of  primary\neducation, three years of lower secondary education, three years of upper secondary education,\none to two years of postsecondary-nontertiary education, and three to seven years of tertiary\neducation.  Curriculum  specialization  starts  in  upper  secondary  where  three  programs  are\noffered (general-academic, vocational, and teacher training) and increases at the tertiary level.\nMOE has responsibility for policy direction, coordination, and planning, as well as for quality\ncontrol of formal and nonformal education. Administrative responsibility for primary education\nlies with the district education bureaus (DEBs), whereas responsibility for secondary education\nlies with the provincial education services (PESs). The country is composed of 18 provinces and\nequivalent,9  which  are  in  turn  organized  into  141  districts  and  about  12,000  villages.  An\nimportant prime ministerial decree on decentralization, issued in March 2000, applies to all the\nsocioeconomic sectors including education, and foresees the province as a strategic unit, the\ndistrict as a planning and budgeting unit, and the village as a basic implementation unit, while\nthe role of the central Government will be to supervise and control the decentralization process.\nThis decree has far-reaching implications for the management of education. The capacity of the\nPESs,  DEBs,  villages,  and  communities  should  be  strengthened  for  planning,  budgeting,\nimplementing, and monitoring tasks allocated to them, while MOE\u2019s capacity to supervise and\ncontrol the education system also needs to be strengthened.\n8. In particular, the allocation of budget has been passed to the provinces and districts.\nWhile  the  ultimate  budgetary  control  rests  with  the  National  Assembly,  the  provincial\ngovernments and district administrations are now assigned greater responsibility for education\nfinancing. The education budget allocation in each province depends on the province\u2019s priorities\nand its ability to raise additional resources for education. The provincial governor has authority\nfor  reallocating,  authorizing,  and  revising  both  capital  and  recurrent  expenditure  including\nteachers\u2019 salaries. However, for those provinces dependent on financial transfer, the Ministry of\nFinance and MOE determine the overall amount to be transferred, following consultations with\neach province.\n3. Primary Education\n9. Access to primary education is not guaranteed for all children, especially for girls in\nethnic  minority  areas;  dropout  and  repetition  rates  remain  high.  In  1999/2000,  the  gross\nenrollment rate in primary school for the country is estimated at 109 percent (117 percent for\nboys and 100 percent for girls), indicating large overage enrollments and high repetition across\nall five grades. The net enrollment rate is estimated at around 77 percent in primary education,\nwith large disparities between provinces, and across gender and ethnic groups, with the ratio at\n35 percent in rural remote areas. In 1999/00, above 831,000 students were enrolled in about\n8,160 primary schools, only 19 percent of which are in good condition, and 54 percent are\nincomplete, offering only the first three grades or less.\n10. The primary education system is highly inefficient; only 41 percent of boys and 37\npercent of girls entering primary education complete the five-year cycle; more than nine years of\nteaching are required to produce a graduate with five years of primary education. In 1999/2000,\ngrade 1 had the highest dropout (16.2 percent) and repetition (33.9 percent) rates, leading to\nexcessively large classes in the early grades. The large number of incomplete schools is an\nimportant factor, but other factors include families giving higher priority to boys\u2019 education,\nkeeping girls at home to care for younger siblings, and keeping children at home to help with\n                  \n9 Including Xaisomboun Special Zone and Vientiane Municipality as \u201cprovinces.\u201d", "4\nfamily work. In ethnic minority areas, language is another barrier to participation in education, as\nthe majority of inhabitants do not speak the national Lao language, which is the language of\ninstruction at school. This contributes to the high dropout and repetition rates in ethnic minority\nareas. Compared with boys, girls are not equally represented in their participation in primary\neducation. Over the country as a whole, the proportion is 55:45 (boys:girls). The gender-ethnic\nminority disparity in participation in primary education is profound in remote areas and among\nethnic minorities, with primary education boy:girl ratios of 62:38 in upland areas, and 71:29 in\nhighland areas.\n11. The poor quality of education in many schools compounds the problem. Although the\nsystem has no overall shortage of primary school teachers, with an average student-teacher\nratio across the country of 30:1, rural areas lack teachers. Trained or certified teachers tend to\nconcentrate in urban or semiurban areas. The areas with the highest percentage (up to 70\npercent) of untrained or unqualified teachers are the remote, mountainous areas with high\nethnic minority populations. Due to the generally low educational status of women, the supply of\nfemale teachers in primary education lags behind male teachers; far fewer female teachers are\navailable in remote, mountainous areas. However, many teachers in incomplete schools teach\nmore than one class through multigrade teaching. The encouragement of multigrade teaching is\nan important government initiative to mitigate the problem of incomplete schools.\n4. Secondary Education\n12. Secondary education is the fastest growing segment of the education system. From\n1996/97 to 1999/2000, enrollment in primary schools increased by about 45,000 students or 1.9\npercent per year, while enrollment in lower secondary education increased by about 50,000\nstudents or 11.1 percent per year and upper secondary education by about 31,000 students or\n18.6 percent per year. This rapid enrollment growth is putting pressure on classroom facilities,\nteacher  supply,  and  availability  of  textbooks  and  instructional  materials.  Currently,\napproximately 70 percent of the children graduating from primary school continue on to lower\nsecondary school. The geographic availability of secondary education is much more limited than\nprimary education. Secondary schools are generally located in larger towns, and generally\nfewer schools are in rural areas.\n5. Postsecondary-Nontertiary Education, and Tertiary Education\n13. One to two years of postsecondary-nontertiary education are provided by 23 midlevel\ntechnical  colleges,  which  are  available  to  students  who  have  completed  upper  secondary\neducation. Eleven of these are under direct MOE administration; the rest are established and\noperated by other ministries. Three to seven years of tertiary education is offered at the National\nUniversity of Laos (NUOL), which was formed in 1995 by consolidating three postsecondary\ninstitutions. By mid-1998, an additional 10 colleges were merged into NUOL. ADB assisted the\nprocess  of  amalgamation  and  consolidation  of  NUOL  under  the  Postsecondary  Education\nRationalization Project (footnote 2). The overall number of tertiary education students is still less\nthan 10,000. The Lao PDR has the lowest per capita enrollment in tertiary education in the\nregion  with  less  than  2  percent  of  Lao  children  progressing  through  secondary  school  to\nuniversity.\n6. Teacher Education and Training\n14. The 59 small teacher training colleges and schools spread around the country and\nrunning largely without a standardized curriculum were consolidated into eight teacher training\ncolleges (TTCs) under the ADB-funded Education Quality Improvement Project (EQIP) (footnote\n2). These eight TTCs now comprise five TTCs that train teachers for both primary and lower", "5\nsecondary schools, one TTC that trains both preprimary and primary school teachers, and two\nTTCs that train primary school teachers. The TTCs provide two training courses for primary\nschool teachers comprising (i) a three-year training program for those who have completed\neight years of schooling (8+3); and (ii) a one-year course for those who have completed 11\nyears of schooling (11+1).\n15. About  16,300  of  the  27,600  primary  school  teachers  have  less  than  the  current\nqualification to teach, which is eight years of schooling (up to lower secondary) and three years\npreservice training (8+3) or 11 years of schooling (up to upper secondary) and one year\npreservice training (11+1). Of these 16,300, about 6,400 teachers in primary education are\nunqualified and have no teacher training at all, and about 9,900 teachers are underqualified. At\nthe  lower  secondary  level,  about  5,450  of  the  7,800  teachers  are  either  unqualified  or\nunderqualified,  and  only  about  30  percent  of  teachers  have  adequate  preservice  teacher\ntraining of 11 years of schooling and three years of preservice training (11+3). Teachers for\nupper secondary schools are trained at the Faculty of Education at NUOL after 11 years of\nprimary and secondary education (11+5).\n16. Three types of teacher training programs are available: preservice teacher training,\nteacher upgrading, and in-service teacher training. Preservice teacher training refers to teacher\ntraining at the eight TTCs for preprimary, primary, and lower secondary; and NUOL for the\nupper secondary level. Teacher upgrading refers to the teacher upgrading program (TUP) using\nthe network teacher upgrading centers (NTUCs) for teachers who are already teaching but who\nare unqualified or have no preservice training. In-service teacher training is offered to current\nteachers to improve their knowledge and skills by the teacher development center (TDC),\nprovincial pedagogical advisers (PAs) for secondary schools, and district PAs and a school\ncluster system for primary schools.\n17. However, the delivery of preservice, upgrading, and in-service teacher training has been\nfragmented and disconnected. Capable, motivated, and well-trained teachers, who are essential\ningredients in quality education, are in critically short supply. The shortage of qualified teachers\nis aggravated by the adverse employment conditions for teachers including low and irregular\npay, often difficult work locations, poor career prospects, and poor training facilities. Approaches\nto improving teacher training include increasing the quality and relevance of preservice teacher\ntraining, expanding in-service teacher training, ensuring a sufficient supply of qualified teachers\nby providing adequate teacher compensation, creating professional development opportunities,\nupgrading teacher training institutions, and strengthening MOE\u2019s capacity to support teacher\ntraining and development systems.\n6. Major Issues\n18. The many educational accomplishments in the Lao PDR over the last decade include\nsystem expansion in enrollments at primary, secondary, postsecondary-nontertiary, and tertiary\nlevels; clarification of roles, responsibilities, and internal structures of MOE, PESs, and DEBs;\nconsolidation and rationalization of institutions of teacher and tertiary education; development of\nnew curriculum and instructional programs for primary and lower secondary schools; production\nand  national  distribution  of  new  textbooks,  teacher  guides,  and  learning  materials;\nimplementation of in-service teacher training programs; and appointment of PAs for primary\nschools in each district and for secondary schools in each province. At the community and\nschool levels, several innovations have been encouraged; for example, school clusters are\nbeing  piloted  to  support  teacher  professional  development  activities  and  the  sharing  of\nresources at the primary and secondary levels; and multigrade teaching has been introduced to\nrespond to the demand from rural, remote, and mountainous areas.", "6\n19. However,  several  significant  issues  remain  to  be  resolved  for  education  sector\ndevelopment.  The  size  and  structure  of  the  education  budget  are  inadequate  to  ensure\ncontinued, balanced growth in the sector. A barrier to success for many children lies in the low\nquality of teacher competencies and learning environment in primary schools. Key issues are\nrelated to (i) teacher training curriculum, textbooks, and teaching materials; (ii) dropouts and\nrepetitions  at  early  grades;  (iii)  teacher  qualifications  and  training  programs;  (iv) teacher\nincentives, including salaries, and career structures; and (v) TTC facilities. In addition, access to\nprimary education is not guaranteed for all children, and is especially limited for girls in ethnic\nminority areas. The education system is also constrained by inadequate numbers of staff with\nmanagement capacity to administer the system.\na. Financing\n20. Prior to the 1997 economic crisis, the education budget as a portion of Government\nexpenditure reached 15.2 percent and its share of GDP was 3.2 percent in FY1996/97, which\ncompared  reasonably  well  with  other  Asian  countries  at  a  similar  level  of  development.\nHowever,  the  current  size  of  the  education  budget,  which  fell  below  8  percent  of  total\nGovernment  expenditures  and  was  around  1.6  percent  of  GDP  during  1998  to  2000,  is\ninadequate  to  ensure  continued,  balanced  growth  in  the  sector.  In  addition,  while  capital\ninvestment in the sector has been considerable over the past few years, this has not been\nbalanced by the necessary recurrent expenditure needed to maintain and support the operation\nof these investments. The recurrent budget share of education expenditures in recent years was\naround 50 to 55 percent, much lower than the 70 percent of neighboring Asian countries. As a\nresult, teacher wages remain low, and little or no recurrent budgets are provided to schools to\nsupport day-to-day teaching and learning activities, and everyday maintenance. To promote\nequitable growth of the education system with improved relevance, quality, and efficiency,\nrecurrent expenditures on education, including teacher salaries and school maintenance, must\nbe substantially increased. However, following the prime ministerial decree on decentralization\nin March 2000, the situation will be exacerbated in terms of regional disparities in the provision\nof education services. To mitigate the situation, the current budget transfer system in support of\n\u201cdeficit\u201d provinces and districts needs to be improved to ensure equity of service provision.\nSchools receive assistance from local communities, and small fees and other contributions from\nparents.  Local  contributions  are  likely  to  be  very  important,  but  only  to  complement  the\nGovernment budget. Such contributions cannot replace what should be an adequate recurrent\nbudget from the central and provincial government authorities, particularly in remote or low\nincome areas.\nb. Teacher Training Curriculum, Textbooks, and Teaching Materials\n21. A new curriculum for primary and lower secondary schools was developed in 1993 by\nthe National Research Institute for Education Sciences (NRIES); the number of subjects to be\ntaught was reduced from 12 to 7. However, copies of this curriculum have yet to reach most\nteachers in service. Even the trainers at the TTCs do not often have access to the curriculum.\nNew textbooks and teaching materials were also produced to support the curriculum over the\npast  few  years.  Although  initiatives  are  under  way  to  ensure  that  schools  receive  these\ntextbooks and materials, most schools appear to be operating with few or no textbooks and\nother teaching materials. The upper secondary school curriculum has not yet been revised nor\nhave new materials been developed.\n22. The existing courses in the TTCs were formulated during the EQIP. However, the quality\nof the courses is limited by a predominance of theoretical instruction and lack of practical\nexperience in the relevant levels of education among the college teaching staff. As a result, few\nstudents are adequately prepared for their careers. TDC carried out curriculum reform for", "7\nteacher education during the EQIP. The adequacy and suitability of this arrangement must now\nbe examined and a stable arrangement needs to be created for continuous renewal of the\nteacher training curriculum and materials. This effort should be closely coordinated with school-\nlevel programs implemented by MOE\u2019s Department of General Education (DGE).\nc. Dropout and Repetition of Early Grades\n23. The unsatisfactory quality of basic education is resulting in high dropout and repetition\nrates. In 1999/2000, more than 50 percent of children repeated grades 1 and 2. This is reflected\nin the class size, where in many schools grades 1 and 2 are twice the size of other classes. No\nteacher can be expected to effectively teach such a large number of children in one class. The\ncurriculum needs to be flexible to meet local needs. In particular, expecting the same level of\nliteracy performance from ethnic minority children as from those with Lao as a native language\nis not realistic. Attempts should be made to make education in the early grades more relevant,\nsuitable, and attainable for these children. Furthermore, as grades 1 and 2 are the basic\nbuilding blocks on which the foundation of the education system are built, primary school\nteacher training should focus on improving teaching at early grades. Consideration should be\nalso given to preschool education and its teacher training, especially in remote, rural areas.\nd. Teacher Qualifications and Training Programs\n24. The TTC system alone is unable to satisfy the country\u2019s needs for primary school\nteachers. To cover the shortages, schools and communities in rural areas are allowed to recruit\nunqualified teachers locally. Unqualified teachers are concentrated in rural, remote areas, where\nthey often constitute more than 40 percent of the teaching force. The official figures do not\ninclude many other unqualified teachers employed as volunteers by communities. The issue of\nnonavailability  of  qualified  teachers  requires  in-depth  analysis  considering  the  available\npreservice training facilities, the performance of existing TTCs, and posttraining career paths of\nthe trainees at the TTCs. The shortage of qualified teachers must also be analyzed in a\ndisaggregated  manner  to  identify  specific  localities  where  only  unqualified  teachers  are\navailable  and  the  linkage  with  the  student  completion  rates  in  secondary  school,  which\ndetermine the availability of potential teachers for primary schools.\n25. To counter the existing problem of unqualified primary teachers, MOE established the\nTUP using the NTUCs with support from assistance agencies, including the United Nations\nChildren\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  and  NGOs.  The  program,  which  is  the  responsibility  of  MOE\u2019s\nDepartment of Teacher Training (DTT), allows unqualified teachers to be trained during holiday\nperiods, allowing them to carry out their usual duties during school time. At the end of the\nprogram, the participants become certified teachers. In seven years, about 4,000 primary school\nteachers have been upgraded through the NTUC approach, but despite this achievement, over\n6,400  unqualified  primary  teachers  still  remain  in  the  system.  MOE  has  responded  very\nfavorably to the TUP. Assistance agencies recommend it as a model to be developed for a\nnationwide in-service teacher training program including further upgrading.\n26. Very few opportunities are available to teachers to upgrade their knowledge and skills\nonce they have started teaching. The provincial authorities have appointed PAs for secondary\nschools, and the district authorities have appointed PAs for primary schools to provide on-the-\njob support to teachers. However, lack of funding severely limits the amount of support they\nactually give. A school cluster system has been developed involving master teachers recruited\nfrom experienced teachers; this system reaches approximately 25 percent of the country\u2019s\nprimary schools and gives access to on-the-job professional development for teachers. Many\nschool clusters are supported by assistance agencies. The impact of the clusters on teachers,\nstudents, school facilities, and school community relations has been assessed as positive in", "8\nterms  of  improved  student  performance,  increased  participation  and  completion  rates,  and\ndecreased number of dropouts. However, the distance between many schools prevents the\nmore widespread adoption of the cluster system, unless alternative models are adopted.\ne. Teacher Incentives and Career Structures\n27. At present, the teaching profession is characterized by low status and salaries. Teachers\neverywhere have second jobs to increase their incomes, often significantly. Compared with\ncountries in the region with a similar level of development, teachers\u2019 salaries are low with a\nrelatively flat salary scale. Thirty years are required for a teacher to progress from the bottom of\neach salary grade to the top, and financial incentives to participate in teacher training are\nminimal. Promotions and transfers are unpredictable, and often based on judgement or criteria\nother than competencies. Policies are in place for incentive payments for teachers who work in\nremote areas, but payment of these incentives is irregular. Teachers in remote areas often\ndepend on the community in which they work to meet their basic needs. No formal certification\nsystem is in place for preservice, upgrading, or in-service training, and therefore no mechanism\nto ensure consistent quality of preservice, upgrading, and in-service teacher training curricula.\nCompletion of the TUP and preservice training at the TTCs is linked to teacher incentives\nincluding salaries, while in-service training is not.\nf. Teacher Training College Facilities\n28. The TTC facilities are incomplete. In some cases, the facilities were designed based on\ninadequate standards. This has resulted in a shortage of dormitories and teachers\u2019 residences\nin some TTCs, and in unsanitary conditions where water supplies do not work satisfactorily and\ntoilet and bathrooms cannot be used. The shortage of recurrent budget from the Government\ncompounds  the  problem.  The  classrooms  and  other  facilities  have  not  been  maintained\nproperly. The living conditions for teachers and students must be improved as a priority. Some\nof the TTCs, notably Pakse and Louang Phrabang TTCs, are at their own initiative developing\ncourses outside the preservice training area to supplement the revenues of the colleges and\nstaff incomes. However, most TTCs are poorly managed and the teacher training offered is less\nthan adequate standard.\ng. Access to and Participation in Primary Education\n29. About 4,000 villages, which are mostly in remote and mountainous ethnic minority areas,\nhave  no  primary  schools.  Fifty-four  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  8,150  primary  schools  are\nincomplete, with the majority offering two years of primary education or less. In some cases, the\nintroduction of multigrade education can make education available to additional grades, and\nmany two or three classroom multigrade schools are being constructed in rural and ethnic\nminority areas. Existing incomplete schools need to be improved to enable children to complete\nfive years of primary education. Resources can be used more efficiently so that participation\nrates are expected to rise by 33 percent. In addition, a sense of ownership and community\nsupport for schools is increasingly viewed as important. The community is the key party in\nschool construction and support for the continued operation and maintenance of the school\ngiven the low level of Government financial support.\n30. Only a small proportion of existing primary school buildings are made from permanent\nbuilding materials, with floors and walls of solid construction and normally corrugated iron roofs.\nMany more buildings are semipermanent, which means they have a solid framework and floors,\nand corrugated iron roofs; the walls are normally of wood or occasionally woven bamboo. Over\nhalf the buildings are of a temporary nature, with dirt floors, woven bamboo walls, and often", "9\nthatched roofs. The condition of the furniture and blackboards in most classrooms is very poor\nand in short supply.\nh. Management of Education\n31. Based on the Government\u2019s decree on decentralization issued in March 2000, MOE\nplans to decentralize the education management structure to improve efficiency of the system.\nThis decentralization process needs to be accompanied by an appropriate legal and regulatory\nframework, clear delegation of responsibility, training of personnel, and availability of resources\nat each administrative level. At the MOE level, responsibilities are distributed in a way that leads\nto competing programs between technical departments. MOE has a huge workload in running\nseveral major projects with only a few adequately qualified staff. The situation is exacerbated by\novercentralized management systems that lead to delays and inefficiencies in implementing\nactivities. Future projects can only be implemented successfully if (i) sufficient competent staff\nand resources are available to plan and implement activities, and (ii) bureaucratic procedures\nare streamlined so that decision making and budgets are delegated to the level where activities\nare to be implemented.\n32. Some functions have already been delegated to lower administrative levels. Provincial\nunits  for  construction  and  development  assistance  (PUCDAs)  were  set  up  to  manage  the\nprovincial  construction  programs.  Many  communities  already  build  and  support  their  own\nschools, even providing their own teachers. Districts allocate teachers to primary schools, and\nthrough the primary school PAs and school clusters, deliver in-service training programs for\nteachers on an ad hoc basis. However, these lower levels of administration do not have control\nof budgets, nor do they often have the authority and capacity to enable them to manage and\ndevelop their own programs. In particular, DEB staff generally have to work in primitive buildings\nwith earth floors and bamboo walls with few resources to back them up. DEBs often lack\ncapacity in data analysis as well as the quality of data to support the planning, budgeting, and\nimplementation of programs.\n33. At the school level, the small amount of resources given to schools severely limits their\nability  to  take  initiatives  unless  the  community  gives  assistance.  Due  to  low  salaries,  the\nenergies of teachers and principals are often channeled into second and third jobs rather than\ntheir schools and the children they teach. Many incomplete schools do not have a school\nprincipal who can take the lead in managing the school\u2019s resources. Necessary actions include\n(i) increasing resource allocations to schools to enable them to improve their schools; (ii) giving\nmanagement responsibility to teachers in each incomplete school; and (iii) providing training on\nproactive school management to school principals and teachers responsible for incomplete\nschools and to community representatives. This all needs to be accompanied by substantial\nincreases in teachers\u2019 and principals\u2019 incentives, including salaries.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n34. The ESDP has helped identify sectorwide priorities for policy reforms and investments.10\nDrawing on the ESDP, MOE produced the education strategic vision which provides a long-term\nvision until 2020 and a framework for continued development of the education sector.11 The\neducation strategic vision emphasizes that the overall policy framework for the education sector\nhas three pillars supported by a base of strengthened planning and management. These three\npillars are equitable access, quality improvement, and improved relevance. The Government\nalso aims to achieve the goal of universal primary education by 2015, by addressing critical\n                  \n10ADB. 2000.

The Education Strategic Vision up to the Year\n2020. Vientiane.", "10\nissues including insufficient access to complete primary education, poor quality of education,\nweak planning and management capabilities, and inadequate recurrent cost financing.\n35. For teacher training and development, MOE has prepared a five-year plan with four\nbroad objectives: (i) develop and deliver systematic teacher preparation programs; (ii) develop\nand deliver systematic professional development programs; (iii) improve the quality of all forms\nof teacher training; (iv) develop the role of TTCs, TDC, and NTUCs for in-service teacher\ntraining; and (v) improve the capacity of DTT to provide policy advice, plan, administer, and\nevaluate all teacher training and professional development activities. In spite of considerable\nprogress  in  increasing  access,  improving  quality,  enhancing  relevance,  and  strengthening\nplanning and management of education, a much greater commitment of the Government will be\nneeded to achieve the goal of quality education for all children.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n36. Between 1991 and 2000, the Lao PDR received approximately $76.0 million in external\nassistance to the basic education sector on a commitment basis. Of this assistance, about\n$52.3 million was committed by ADB and the World Bank. ADB supported the EQIP, focusing\non  the  development  of  the  teacher  education  system  for  primary  and  lower  secondary\neducation,  i.e.,  rationalizing  preservice  teacher  training,  upgrading  physical  facilities,  and\nestablishing an in-service training system and TDC. ADB is also supporting the Basic Education\n(Girls)  Project  (BEGP)  (footnote  2),  cofinanced  by  the  Australian  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment, which is providing school facilities, curriculum, teacher training, and instructional\nmaterials to girls and ethnic minorities, and developing the educational management information\nsystem. The World Bank, together with Norway and Switzerland, supported the Education\nDevelopment  Project  (EDP),  which  helped  develop  and  implement  new  school  curricula,\ninstructional  materials,  and  pedagogical  support  systems  for  primary  and  lower  secondary\neducation; constructed primary and lower secondary schools; and strengthened institutional\ncapacities in educational administration and management. In parallel with the preparation of the\nproposed Project, the World Bank is preparing the Second Education Development Program\n(EDP  II)  including  constructing  schools,  revising  school  curriculum  and  textbooks,  and\nstrengthening education management.\n37. Several  United  Nations  agencies,  bilateral  agencies,  and  NGOs  have  smaller  but\nsignificant programs from which many positive lessons can be learned. UNICEF, Save the\nChildren Fund-United Kingdom, Save the Children Fund-Norway, Christian Relief Service, and\nChurch  World  Service  are  supporting  the  TUP  that  has  offered  teacher  training  to  many\nunqualified  teachers.  UNICEF  is  also  the  largest  supporter  of  school  cluster  networks  for\nprimary schools and is involved in community primary school construction programs. The NGOs\nhave mainly concentrated on primary education, teacher training, and nonformal education in\nrural and ethnic minority areas. Sida is supporting a pilot project for TTC administrators and\nteachers  to  develop  participatory  action  research  approaches  for  clarifying  problems  and\nidentifying solutions, and is planning national support for teacher education and development, in\ncooperation with ADB. Japan International Cooperation Agency supports capacity building for\nTTC teachers and PAs with a focus on the delivery of science and mathematics subjects, and is\nplanning  a  school  construction  program  in  Vientiane  Province  and  Vientiane  Municipality.\nFrance has expressed interest in supporting education management, and school construction in\nChampassak. The European Union is considering providing substantial support for the primary\neducation sector, but details are not yet known. External assistance to basic education is in\nAppendix 2.\n38. Recently, increasing dialogue has taken place to improve aid coordination. Under the\nguidance of MOE, the Embassy of Sweden-Sida are supporting the process of aid coordination", "11\nin cooperation with ADB, World Bank, and other concerned assistance agencies. This has\nresulted in a division of responsibilities in supporting the education sector. ADB continues to\ntake greater responsibility for developing teacher education, while the World Bank supports\ngeneral education focusing on school curriculum and textbooks. However, in responding to the\nGovernment\u2019s priority to achieve universal primary education, the Donor Roundtable Meeting in\nMay 2000 confirmed that multilateral development banks, bilateral assistance agencies, and\nNGOs would support primary school construction programs as a priority area for assistance.\nDiscussions have also taken place to ensure a rational division of projects geographically to\navoid overlapping of resources, especially in supporting school construction programs and\neducation management. The geographical coverage for school construction will not overlap\nbetween the proposed Project and the BEGP. In the provinces where bilateral agencies are\nexpected to provide school construction support (e.g., Champassak and Vientiane), the Project\nwill  focus  on  the  provision  of  teacher  training  to  ensure  the  complementary  role  in  these\nprovinces. The Government has agreed that the World Bank\u2019s EDP II will identify provinces that\nthe proposed Project will not cover for school construction. Strengthening management capacity\nis another common area of concern in light of the proposed decentralization of education\nmanagement.  ADB\u2019s  support  for  capacity  building  will  focus  on  the  provincial  and  district\ndelivery of school construction and teacher training programs, while the World Bank and France\nwill strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity of MOE, PESs, DEBs, and school principals\nby upgrading and improving the education management information system. Dialogue also\ncontinues among the development partners to ensure that lessons are learned from each\nother\u2019s projects. In this context, the Project will build on previous assistance initiatives including\nthe  PA  and  school  cluster  systems,  the  TUP  and  NTUC  systems,  and  community  school\nconstruction initiatives.\nD. Lessons Learned\n39. In  general,  investment  projects  in  the  Lao  PDR  have  experienced  frequent\nimplementation difficulties due to the lax management at all administrative levels. A key lesson\nlearned from postevaluation findings is the need to establish strong management capacity as\nwell as strong project implementation capabilities.12 Implementation delays in several current\nand previous projects are also caused by (i) MOE\u2019s complex procedures, (ii) bureaucratic and\novercentralized  Government  procedures,  and  (iii)  inadequate  staff  to  implement  projects.\nTherefore, projects should not be overly ambitious and should use existing structures and\nprocedures with which Government staff are familiar. Where additional management loads are\nbeing imposed, additional assistance should be provided.\n40. ADB\u2019s EQIP aimed to support (i) reforms in teacher training through policy development\nby establishing the National Teacher Education Advisory Board, (ii) curriculum and training\nreforms by establishing TDC, (iii) upgrading of TTC facilities; (iv) in-service training for teacher\ntrainers and educational administrators; and (v) development, production, and distribution of\ntextbooks, instructional materials, and teachers guides for the TTCs. Overall, the EQIP was\nsuccessful. The achievements include (i) the National Teacher Education Advisory Board has\nsuccessfully guided the adoption of enhanced qualifications for TTC graduates and coordinated\nimplementation of the new curriculum for teacher training; (ii) TDC has become a key institute\nfor in-service training and research and development work related to curriculum development;\n(iii) facilities of 8 TTCs have been constructed or upgraded; and (iv) a total of 140 textbooks, 78\nteachers  guides,  and  60  kinds  of  instructional  materials  were  successfully  produced  and\ndistributed. Some valuable lessons learned from the EQIP, which pertain specifically to teacher\ntraining,  include  (i) comprehensive,  well-articulated  policy,  strategies,  and  mechanisms  for\n                  \n12Postevaluation Office. 1994. Country Synthesis of Postevaluation Findings in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic.\nADB, Manila.", "12\nintegrating  teacher  training  and  development  need  to  be  developed  and  consolidated;\n(ii) stakeholder should be involved in project design to help ensure project quality including\ntimely  site  selection  and  more  effective  project  supervision;  (iii)  capacity  building  at  all\nadministrative levels of project management and implementation is essential; (iv) sufficient\nbudgetary allocations to operation and maintenance of the facilities should be assured; and\n(v) future ADB assistance to the sector should be based on a long-term commitment to the\ncountry\u2019s needs for continuity of support.13 In particular, largely due to insufficient allocation of\nrecurrent budget for operation and maintenance of TTC facilities during the recent economic\ncrisis in the region, learning and living conditions for teachers and students have deteriorated\nand urgently need to be improved.\n41. Effectiveness  of  the  ongoing  teacher  training  programs,  consisting  of  preservice,\nupgrading, and in-service, on the quality of classroom teaching-learning processes have not\nbeen comprehensively evaluated. The outcomes to be achieved in terms of changes in teaching\nperformance at the schools must be clearly specified. Teachers should be reoriented to provide\nactive,  participatory,  and  enjoyable  learning  experiences  for  students  in  and  outside  the\nclassroom. However, teacher training programs should be realistic in what can be expected;\nteachers often have a very low level of general schooling. This observation is confirmed by a\nlesson  related  to  teacher  training  learned  from  the  World  Bank\u2019s  EDP.  In-service  training\nprograms for teachers, which are separate from an ongoing professional support program by\nthe PA system or the school cluster system, will have short-term benefits at best.\n42. Some early lessons learned from ADB\u2019s ongoing BEGP, which aims to expand access to\nimproved  education  for  girls  in  ethnic  minority  areas,  include  (i)  the  lengthy  processing\nprocedures for the imprest account need to be simplified so that implementation can proceed;\nand (ii) due to limited MOE capacity, qualified local staff have to be provided to assist MOE in\nimplementing the Project, together with clear job descriptions for relevant MOE staff involved in\nproject implementation.\n43. In addition, experience with the World Bank\u2019s EDP, ADB\u2019s BEGP, UNICEF\u2019s programs,\nand NGO education projects related to civil works and community involvement shows that\ncommunity contributions are best used for activities supporting construction and maintenance,\ne.g., building fences and providing labor for wells, involvement in planning and management,\nand operation and maintenance of the schools. To ensure that communities make use of the\nfacilities and support the schools over the long term, a sense of ownership must be developed\nin  the  communities,  and  measures  instituted  to  encourage  parents  to  send  their  children,\nespecially girls, to school.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n44. ADB\u2019s sector strategy for education in the Lao PDR is a part of its overall strategy for\npoverty  reduction,  of  which  human  development  and  gender  and  development  are  key\ncomponents. Investments in primary and secondary education are essential to increase human\ncapital and productivity of the poor. ADB will assist the Government in achieving the goal of\nquality education for all children. In particular, ADB will continue to improve coverage, quality,\nand relevance of basic education services by focusing on increasing primary school enrollment\nand  retaining  disadvantaged  children,  and  improving  teacher  competencies  and  learning\nachievements  mainly  through  teacher  training.  Strengthening  management  capacity  of  the\neducation  system  with  improved  efficiency  and  sustainability  of  education  financing  are\nessential aspects of this strategy. As part of the policy dialogue during project processing, ADB\nencouraged the Government to redress existing inequalities in basic education and provide\n                  \n13PCR: LAO 23047: Education Quality Improvement Project, June 2000.", "13\nmore efficient delivery of services by encouraging active community involvement in project\nplanning and implementation. The proposed Project will support the strategy by improving the\nquality of teaching and learning, increasing equitable access to and participation in primary\neducation, and strengthening the capacity of MOE, PESs, DEBs, and villages to plan and\nmanage the decentralized education system. To strengthen institutional and human resource\ncapacity for implementing decentralization policy, an advisory TA to strengthening decentralized\neducation management is included in the 2002 program.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n45. Policy  dialogue  has  focused  on  the  financial  sustainability  of  the  education  sector\nincluding the Project, and the Project\u2019s potential to improve the quality of teaching and learning\nby integrating teacher training and development systems, promoting equitable access to and\nincreasing participation in primary education, and strengthening the institutional capacity of the\nGovernment to manage the decentralized education system with good governance. The policy\nframework for the Project is in Appendix 3, and a summary of policy dialogue held with the\nGovernment follows.\n1.  Financing Education\n46. The Government recognizes that education budgets have been inadequate, and low\nteacher salaries severely constrain the possibility of building a competent dedicated teaching\nforce. The need to ensure budget allocation for education from the public expenditure budget\nand for efficient intersectoral allocation is a key feature of the policy framework. By interacting\nwith the Government\u2019s public expenditure review process and as a common policy agenda\nbetween ADB and the World Bank, the Government has agreed to increase the budget for\neducation expenditure to at least 12 percent of the total budget in FY2001/02, at least 13\npercent in FY2003/04, and for the medium term, up to 15 percent by FY2005/06. This level was\nachieved, on average, from FY1994/95 to FY1996/97, prior to the regional economic crisis. In\nparticular,  the  need  for  sufficient  budget  allocation  to  cover  recurrent  costs  has  been\nemphasized,  by  adjusting  the  existing  pattern  of  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures.  The\nGovernment needs to give increased priority to provisions for recurrent education expenditures\nespecially for operation and maintenance of primary schools and TTCs, and salaries for existing\nand new teachers. In October 2000, civil servants\u2019 salaries including those of teachers were\nincreased by up to 40 percent, although a substantial increase is needed in subsequent years to\nbring salaries to an acceptable level. ADB and the World Bank will jointly address the need to\nretain the share of education budget to primary education at 55 percent of the total education\nexpenditure,  and  increase  teacher  salaries  during  project  implementation.  For  the  schools\nconstructed  or  rehabilitated  and  TTC  facilities  upgraded,  a  demand-driven  management\nstructure will be installed in addition to increased recurrent expenditures to be allocated. For\nexample, the Government will encourage (i) the community to contribute in-kind in building\nschools and to meet basic operation and maintenance requirements, and (ii) selected TTCs to\nengage in the revenue-generating activities to cover some operation and maintenance costs.\n2. Improving the Quality of Teaching and Learning\n47. One of the central thrusts of the Project is to achieve improved education quality through\na better-trained and better-motivated teaching force. This can be accomplished through better\nintegration of preservice, upgrading, and in-service teacher training programs; development of\nmodern  competencies  in  teaching;  and  improved  salaries  and  working  conditions  for  the\nteaching profession. First, MOE has agreed to develop a teacher education strategy in which\nthe long-term measures for reforming the preservice teacher training framework will be identified\nto provide more in-depth teacher preparation at the TTCs, and to phase out the 8+3 and 11+1", "14\ncourses to be replaced by the 11+2 and 11+3 courses. Such a reform would require a more\ncareful analysis of the whole teacher training system both quantitatively and qualitatively, so that\na time-bound program could be developed to reach the goal. Second, the Government will\nestablish  a  teacher  policy  working  group  (TPWG)  in  MOE  to  reform  teachers\u2019  incentive\nmechanisms including teachers\u2019 salaries, and improve working conditions and future career\nprospects of teachers. Given the varied needs of the system and the limited financial and\nhuman resources available, much of ADB\u2019s dialogue has focused on the need to set appropriate\npriorities. Accordingly, priority will also be given to improving the system of preservice and\nupgrading programs for teachers through the TTCs and TUP, and to developing the nationwide\nin-service training program based on the successful NTUC system and in cooperation with the\nTTCs and the PAs. Thus, the Government will integrate preservice, upgrading, and in-service\nteacher training with the necessary reforms of teacher incentives including salaries and working\nconditions in order to create a better motivated workforce and retain teachers in the profession.\n48. In  addition,  dialogue  with  Government  officials,  teacher  trainers,  teachers,  and\nrepresentatives from the LWU identified a demand for local training, especially to assist women\nwho  need  to  qualify  as  teachers.  The  Government  will  continue  to  support  increasing\neducational opportunities for ethnic minorities, support recruitment of qualified ethnic minority\nwomen as teachers, and ensure that they are provided appropriate training to allow them to\nteach in their own communities.\n3. Increasing Access to and Participation in Education\n49. The Government will give priority to primary education expansion in underserved and\nethnic minority areas by upgrading incomplete schools to five grades and introducing multigrade\nteaching where appropriate; and encourage community participation for school construction,\noperation, and maintenance. To increase access to and participation in primary schooling, the\nProject  will  upgrade  incomplete  primary  schools  through  locally  supported  construction;\nrehabilitate existing primary schools as necessary; build new complete schools in villages where\ncurrently no primary education is available; ensure that teachers are provided in the new\nschools; mobilize community support for planning, management, operation, and maintenance of\nthe school; and provide school funds to support learning activities and participation in education.\nDialogue with MOE, PESs, PUCDAs, and DEBs show a clear need to build flexibility into school\ndesigns, responding to community demands for expanding access to education, and increasing\nopportunities to complete the primary cycle. This is well reflected in recent education plans and\nin ongoing community support programs for schools, mainly by UNICEF and NGOs. With ADB\nsupport, the Government is introducing multigrade schools and teaching as a national strategy\nto improve access in remote and underserved areas, and will continue to support multigrade\nschools  and  teaching.  In  term  of  the  prototype  designs  of  schools  to  be  constructed  or\nrehabilitated,  both  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  have  agreed  to  take  a  \u201cminimum  common\nstandard\u201d approach, which means permanent school buildings will have a life span of more than\n25 years or the semipermanent school building a life span of more than 25 years for the main\nstructure. The proposed Project and the World Bank\u2019s EDP II will include a community-managed\nschool construction or rehabilitation program.\n4. Strengthening Management Capacity in Education\n50. Following the prime ministerial decree on decentralization of March 2000, MOE will\nimplement the decree in a phased manner by specifying the legal and regulatory framework,\nfunctions of the different administrative levels of the system, and task description of each\nfunction; and by allocating adequate budget and staff resources and decision-making authority\nto  support  delegated  activities.  However,  the  extent  of  decentralization,  the  specific\ncharacteristics of the emerging roles and functions at different administrative levels, and the", "15\ndegree of ownership of activities allowed for the districts and villages is still to be defined. In the\neducation sector, dialogue and debate will continue for some time at each administrative level\nand across administrative levels on such issues as the functions that are best performed at\neach level, the various kinds of training required, the necessary information system to support\nthe change, and the fiscal implications associated with the decentralization process. Dialogue\nwith MOE officials has produced much enthusiasm and considerable agreement about the\nimportance of strengthening the institutional capacity of the central, provincial, district, and\nvillage level administrations to plan and manage the decentralized education system. MOE has\nset  up  a  steering  committee  to  oversee  the  process  of  decentralization  and  a  technical\ncommittee to draw up MOE\u2019s guidelines and action plans for decentralization. MOE has agreed\nto organize a workshop to discuss policy and prepare MOE\u2019s guidelines and action plans for\npursuing  decentralized  education  management,  including  simplified  procedures  to  ensure\nsmooth and prompt decision making and fund flows, and the development of an accountability\nsystem at the provincial, district, and village levels.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n51. The education system in the Lao PDR has improved substantially but still faces many\nchallenges. Much remains to be done to achieve the Government\u2019s goal of universal primary\neducation, and raise the quality of education to approach standards in neighboring countries.\nVery low public expenditure on education has been a major constraint to ensuring continued,\nbalanced growth in the system, which is characterized by inequitable access to quality basic\neducation, especially primary education for the poor, girls, and ethnic minorities, and weak\ncapacity to manage the system. In particular, improving the quality of teaching competencies\nand the learning environment is key to improved quality of education, and reducing dropout and\nrepetition. Project interventions to improve the quality of education were made under the EQIP\ncompleted in 1998 and are ongoing under the BEGP. These efforts have to be continued as the\noverall competencies and qualifications of teachers are still inadequate. Competent teachers\nshould be encouraged to remain in the profession. Therefore, a national system of teacher\neducation should be developed with enhanced career development prospects for teachers. The\nproposed Project will develop a national teacher training support system based on the reforms\nin the teacher training system initiated under the EQIP, and implement intensive and integrated\nteacher training programs in selected provinces and districts.\n52. The Project has been formulated within ADB\u2019s overarching objective of poverty reduction\nand  the  Government\u2019s  education  strategic  vision  (footnote  11).  In  particular,  quality  basic\neducation for every child is a right to which the Government subscribes. The Project will mainly\nfocus on developing a teacher training support system; improving teachers\u2019 incentives including\nsalaries,  and  working  conditions;  upgrading  TTC  facilities  and  other  training  facilities  and\nequipment; and delivering pre- and in-service teacher training and teacher upgrading. The\nProject will contribute to increased access to primary education in selected underserved areas\nby encouraging participation by students and support from communities, by providing trained\nteachers on a sustainable basis, and hence by ensuring the quality of education provided in the\nschools. The Project will especially target the underserved ethnic minority areas where gender\ndisparities in access to and retention in education are large. The Project will also support the\nGovernment\u2019s plan of decentralizing education management by providing assistance to develop\ninstitutional, management, and project implementation capabilities at the provincial, district, and\nvillage levels, since much of the management of access and quality activities will occur at the\nthese levels.", "16\nB. Objectives and Scope\n53. The long-term goal of the Project is to contribute to poverty reduction in the Lao PDR by\nhelping the Government achieve quality education for all children. The objectives of the Project\nare to (i) improve the relevance, quality, and efficiency of primary and secondary education by\ndeveloping the teacher training support system, developing a strategy to increase the number of\nfemale  and  ethnic  minority  teachers,  enhancing  teacher  competencies  and  improving  the\nprofessional status and career development prospects of teachers, constructing and upgrading\ntraining facilities, and delivering intensive teacher training programs at the provincial and district\nlevels; (ii) expand access to and improve retention in primary schools especially of girls in poor,\nunderserved  areas  of  the  country;  and  (iii)  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  central,\nprovincial,  district,  and  village  level  administrations  to  plan  and  manage  the  decentralized\neducation system and implement the Project. The Project will operate at the national level to\ndevelop the teacher training support system including schemes to enhance career development\nprospects and welfare of teachers. The Project will be implemented at provincial and district\nlevels in selected provinces and districts to deliver integrated packages of activities to improve the\nquality of teaching and learning, and access to and participation in education. The Project will\ncomplement  ongoing  and  planned  projects  including  the  ADB-funded  BEGP,  especially  in\nexpanding access to primary education, and the World Bank\u2019s EDP II focusing on general\neducation.\n54. The  Project  includes  several  integrated  elements:  (i)  in-service  teacher  training  and\nupgrading of unqualified teachers; (ii) school construction and rehabilitation; and (iii) funds to\nsupport school operation and maintenance, learning especially in the early grade classes, and\nparticipation in education; and to purchase books and learning materials. The Project will focus its\nintegrated  packages  of  activities  in  six  project  provinces:  Bokeo,  Champassak,  Louang\nPhrabang, Savannakhet, and Sayaburi, and Vientiane. Improving the quality of teaching and\nlearning, and strengthening management capacity components will be implemented in all six\nprovinces (with 61 districts). However, the access component focuses on the four provinces\n(Bokeo, Louang Phrabang, Savannakhet, and Sayaburi) of these six provinces only (with 41\ndistricts), all of which have significant poor, underserved, and ethnic group areas. The average\nprovincial poverty incidence of these provinces is higher than the national poverty incidence\nlevel of 38.6 percent (footnote 7). School construction in the other two provinces, Champassak\nand Vientiane, is expected to be supported by other assistance agencies. A more limited quality\nimprovement program will be supported in nine additional districts in three provinces: Louang\nNamtha, Saravane, and Xieng Khouang.14\n55. The  project  provinces  are  strategically  situated  around  seven  of  the  eight  TTCs,\nincluding the four largest and most influential.15 The TTCs will be given an increased role in the\nintegrated teacher training system so that they become involved in developing, managing, and\nimplementing  upgrading  and  in-service  training  programs  for  teachers,  in  addition  to  their\ntraditional role in preservice teacher training. Thus, the TTCs will work closely with the PAs and\nNTUC trainers in their respective provinces and districts. While the Project is envisaged to\ndevelop the national teacher training support system, the delivery of upgrading and in-service\nteacher training will first target selected provinces in and nearby the provinces where the TTCs\nare strategically located. The project activities will be implemented in four phases to enable\nmodels  and  management  capacity  to  be  developed.  Accordingly,  the  proposed  choices  of\nprovinces will enable integration of the project activities at provincial and district levels, which\nwill in turn support the process of decentralization in education management for both increasing\n                  \n14These are the provinces in which three TTCs (Louang Namtha TTC, Saravane TTC, and Xieng Khouang TTC) are\nsituated.\n15These four TTCs are: Louang Phrabang TTC in the Northern Region; Vientiane Province TTC in the Central\nRegion; and Pakse TTC and Savannakhet TTC in the Southern Region.", "17\naccess to and improving quality of education in a phased manner. The project components are\nbriefly described in para. 56-69 and details are in Appendix 4.\n1. Component 1: Improving the Quality of Teaching and Learning\n56. As a priority focus of the Project, the quality of teaching and learning in schools will be\nimproved within the integrated teacher training and development framework comprising three\nsubcomponents:  (i)  building  a  teacher  training  system  and  teacher  development  capacity\nincluding teacher incentives, salaries, and working conditions; (ii) upgrading TTC and other\ntraining facilities, and equipment; and (iii) delivering integrated provincial and district teacher\ntraining programs. The provincial and district level training will be delivered in a total of 70\ndistricts in nine provinces.\na. Building  Teacher  Training  System  and  Teacher  Development\nCapacity\n57. In the long term, the task will be to design and develop an improved system of teacher\ntraining comparable with international standards and suitable to primary and secondary schools\nof the Lao PDR. TTC management will be improved to enable them to take a greater and more\neffective role in preservice and upgrading training, where demand exists, to expand their role to\ncontinuing education. The Project will support the development of teacher training system\ncapacity as follows: MOE departments involved in teacher education, including DTT, DGE, and\nNRIES, will be given assistance to develop a coherent teacher education strategy that reflects\nthe country\u2019s priorities, including the reform agenda of the preservice teacher training system,\nand will improve the supply and quality of teachers. DTT, in cooperation with TDC and TTCs,\nwill develop, produce, and deliver curricula and training materials for preservice, upgrading of\nuntrained teachers, and in-service professional training. The curricula and materials will be\nbased on a realistic set of competencies that are focused on developing a higher quality of\nteaching in schools, and will address observed training needs. DTT will develop guidelines for\ncertification of teachers taking part in preservice, upgrading programs, training of trainers, and\nin-service programs. A cadre of well-prepared trainers at the TTCs will be created by training\nTTC staff, TUP trainers, PAs, and academic teachers with adequate attention paid to ethnic\ndiversity and gender balance. Preservice teacher education takes place through training at the\nTTCs. The structure of the TTC system was rationalized under the EQIP. An attempt was made\nto  reform  the  teacher  training  curriculum  through  TDC.  The  Project  will  focus  on  further\nimprovement by reviewing, revising, and if necessary, reforming the teacher training curriculum.\nThis will involve training TTC personnel in delivering courses more effectively, including training\nTTC directors and other concerned staff on effective institutional management.\n58. A TPWG will be established in MOE and staffed to ADB\u2019s satisfaction within three\nmonths of loan effectiveness. The TPWG will develop concrete proposals and an action plan for\nimproved career, salary, and incentive systems for teachers that link experience, training, and\nperformance. The TPWG will operate within a strict time frame and the Government will be\nexpected to formulate and implement plans based on the group\u2019s proposals, and monitor their\nimpact on teachers and schools. The TPWG should adequately reflect the concerns of women,\nethnic minority teachers, and remote communities. Staff of the gender and ethnic minorities\neducation unit (GEMEU) of MOE\u2019s DGE will be included in the TPWG to adequately represent\nthe concerns of women and ethnic minorities, and the TPWG will develop affirmative actions for\nthe promotion policy for women and ethnic minorities. The Project will assist MOE in its efforts\nto increase teacher salaries and incentives to an acceptable level. Completion of in-service\ntraining courses will be linked to upgrading qualifications, improved incentives including salaries,\nand career structures developed by the TPWG.", "18\nb. Construction and Upgrading of Training Facilities\n59. TTC facilities and equipment will be upgraded to improve living conditions for teachers\nand students and enable the colleges to function more effectively, paying special attention to the\nconditions for female students. Equipment will be provided to 12 of 18 provincial secondary\nschool PA resource centers, which do not yet have equipment, to strengthen their capacity to\neffectively support secondary school teachers. The Project will also provide similar equipment\npackages to the NTUCs in the nine project provinces in order to support the TUP. In addition,\nresource centers will be constructed to support clusters in project districts that currently have no\ncenter.\nc. Delivering Provincial and District Teacher Training\n60. The teacher training schemes will build on the successful NTUC system as the basis of\na nationwide in-service teacher training network under DTT. A system of in-service training for\nlower and upper secondary teachers will be introduced in cooperation with the TTCs and the PA\nsystem, based initially at the provincial level, but with the option to develop models based on the\nNTUC  network.  The  Project  will  work  with  other  assistance  agencies  to  support  the\ndevelopment of the school cluster network system for primary schools where appropriate, and\ndevelop alternatives for schools and teachers that cannot be reached by that system. Finally,\nthe Project will seek to institutionalize these schemes to better ensure their sustainability after\nproject implementation.\n61. The delivery of teacher training programs will be implemented in a phased manner in\nline with the development of provincial and district training and management capacity, and to\nlearn lessons and make improvements to programs on an ongoing basis. The programs for\nprimary school teachers will be developed in four phases: phase 1 will start in 12 districts in 6\nprovinces (Bokeo, Champassak, Louang Phrabang, Savannakhet, Sayaburi, and Vientiane) in\nyear 1. Phase 2 will start in another 12 districts in the same provinces in year 2. Phase 3 will\nstart in an additional 37 districts in the same provinces in year 3. Secondary school programs\nwill start in year 3 in the six provinces. Phase 4 will start with limited programs that will run in a\nfurther three provinces (Louang Namtha, Saravane, and Xieng Khouang) starting in the fourth\nyear.  MOE  will  submit  the  list  of  project  villages  and  schools  (selected  based  on  criteria\nacceptable to ADB) to ADB for review and approval on the following time schedule: (i) for\nvillages  and  schools  in  the  12  project  districts  in  phase  1,  within  six  months  of  loan\neffectiveness, (ii) for villages and schools in the 12 project districts in phase 2, no later than\nthree months after the first anniversary of loan effectiveness, (iii) for villages and schools in the\n37 project districts in phase 3, no later than three months after the second anniversary of loan\neffectiveness, and (iv) for villages and schools in the 9 project districts in phase 4, no later than\nthree months after the third anniversary of loan effectiveness.\n62. The Project will work to raise the quality of the training provided by the TUP (para. 25) in\nthe nine project provinces by reviewing and revising the curricula and training materials, and by\ntraining TUP staff and managers. It will support the TUP especially in rural and remote areas\nwith  many  unqualified  teachers,  by  coordinating  with  other  assistance  agencies  including\nUNICEF to ensure nationwide coverage. It will also train unqualified teachers recruited to teach\nin schools and classrooms built during the course of the Project.\n2. Component 2: Increasing Access to and Participation in Education\n63. The Project will increase access to and participation in primary education in 41 districts\nin four provinces (Bokeo, Louang Phrabang, Savannakhet, and Sayaburi) in three phases:\nphase 1 with 8 districts, phase 2 with 8 districts, and phase 3 with 25 districts. This component", "19\nwill include mapping and data collection in the first year of each phase to establish the needs\nand demand for school construction, and school funds in the underserved areas. Criteria has\nbeen established regarding the characteristics of such areas and how they will qualify for\nsupport.  Priority  will  be  given  to  (i)  upgrading  incomplete  schools  to  five  grades;16  and\n(ii) building new complete schools in the villages that have no practical access to primary\neducation.17 The Project will also support the construction of multigrade schools of two or three\nclassrooms.\na. Increasing Access to Primary Education\n64. The Project will adopt a flexible demand-driven approach in districts that will formulate\ntheir own plans suited to their own needs. Each of the 41 project districts will be allocated with\nconstruction funds of $150,000 on average over three years to be spent on increasing access to\nprimary education. The budget in each project district will be determined by MOE within one\nyear of loan effectiveness and submitted to ADB for review and approval. Districts will undertake\nschool mapping and data collection as the basis for their planning. Standard design schools and\nclassrooms will include two, three, and five classroom schools as needed. At least 50 percent of\nthe  funds  must  be  spent  on  upgrading  incomplete  schools.  The  Project  will  also  allocate\nmatching funds to local communities to enable them to rehabilitate, complete or extend their\nschools. The component will focus on areas where local communities have demand and are\ncommitted to help construct, support, and maintain their schools. They will also be asked to find\nteachers from their own communities, where no other source is available. The Government will\npay the salaries of these teachers, while the Project will provide training for them.\nb. Encouraging Participation\n65. The Project recognizes the need to strengthen the ability of schools and communities to\nmanage their schools, and will establish the principle of a Government budget allocation to\nschools. To support participation and learning in primary schools in project districts, the Project\nwill provide schools with an annual budget of about $130 equivalent. Schools will manage this\nfund themselves as part of the effort to encourage school-based management of resources. The\nschool fund will be mainly used to support operation and maintenance of schools. To make\ncommunity demand a key factor in the school building program, approximately 50 percent of the\nfunds will be used to encourage special programs devised by schools and local communities to\nsupport learning, especially in the early grade classes, and participation in education, especially\namong girls and ethnic minorities. The Project will finance an operational study to assess the\neffectiveness of special programs on reducing dropouts and repetition, and improving learning\nin schools. The Project will also provide a package of books and other learning materials\namounting to $125 equivalent to each school in project districts. The Project will thus provide\nmodels of what the Government itself should be doing on a routine basis. After the Project, the\nschool fund and provision of books and learning materials will become the norm for all schools\nas routine education provision. Furthermore, training will be given to village heads and members\nof the LWU together with other village women to raise community awareness and support.\nSocial development coordinators will work with schools and communities to support these\nparticipation programs.\n                  \n16Criteria for supporting completion of incomplete schools are (i) the school is not currently operating up to grade\nfive; (ii) the school has viable numbers of students in its existing classes; and (iii) no practical alternative school is\navailable for children to complete their education.\n17Criteria for supporting the building of new complete schools are (i) the village should have at least 50 children (6-10\nyears old) able to enter in the primary school or be situated in an area between villages with at least 100 children\n(6-10 years old); and (ii) the village should be a long-term settlement.", "20\n3. Component  3:  Strengthening  Management  Capacity  and  Project\nImplementation\n66. The Project will improve the ability of the different administrative units to manage the\ntasks allocated to PESs, DEBs, and communities/villages, while strengthening the capacity of\nMOE to supervise and control the decentralization process. The Project will coordinate closely\nwith  the  ADB-funded  BEGP,  the  World  Bank,  and  other  bilateral  agencies  involved  in\nstrengthening the management of education. The Project will build on and improve current\nmanagement structures and practice rather than introduce totally new structures. This includes\nthe management of PESs, PUCDAs, DEBs, the TUP system, and the PA and school cluster\nsystems. The Project will support the long-term development of these management structures at\neach level of education administration and services in line with the decentralization process.\nProject activities will build up planning and management capacity at MOE to support teacher\ntraining and development, and develop capacity at the PESs, DEBs, and community/village\nlevels  to  support  project  implementation  including  the  planning  and  implementation  of\nconstruction, school support, and teacher training programs. In particular, the coordination\nfunction of the PES to deliver in-service training and teacher upgrading programs through TTCs,\nTDC, and TUP-NTUCs will be strengthened in cooperation with the PA system and PA resource\ncenters.\na. Strengthening Capacity of MOE\n67. The Project will support the following MOE departments: (i) DTT and DGE, which will\ntogether manage the development of the teacher training system capacity and supervise the\noverall teacher training programs throughout the country; (ii) the Department of Planning and\nInternational Cooperation (DPC) which will coordinate project activities within MOE using a\nstreamlined procedure, and liaise with other government and assistance agencies; (iii) the\nEducation Construction Service within MOE\u2019s Department of Finance, which will supervise the\nplanning and implementation of district level construction programs; and (iv) MOE\u2019s Department\nof Personnel, which will lead the TPWG. MOE will organize a policy workshop to discuss and\nprepare MOE\u2019s guidelines and action plans for pursuing decentralized education management.\nAs most of the project activities are aimed at building up systems that will continue to operate on\na routine basis after project completion, consulting services and training will be concentrated\nmore at the start of the Project and will aim to build MOE capacity to implement the programs\nindependently. Due to a shortage of qualified staff and a moratorium on new civil service\nappointments, two qualified assistants with budgeting and accounting, and reporting skills will\nbe provided to the project implementation unit (PIU) under DTT.\nb. Strengthening Capacity of the PESs and DEBs\n68. The PESs and DEBs will have responsibility for planning and implementing school\nconstruction, school support, and teacher training programs, both under the Project and for the\nlonger term under the decentralization process. The Project will help review PES and DEB\norganizational structures and provide training to both. The Project will in particular use the\nPUCDAs, which were developed under the World Bank-funded EDP, to manage and support\nthe construction program. PES and DEB personnel are already concerned with the organization\nand implementation of teacher training. At the PES level, these include the TUP trainers and the\nsecondary school PAs. At the DEB level they are the primary school PAs. Provincial PIUs\n(PPIUs) will be set up at PESs and district PIUs (DPIUs) at DEBs. Units will be set up at PESs\nand DEBs to support teacher training programs. A construction unit will be formed at the DEB\nlevel to support the district construction programs.", "21\n69. The Project will provide consulting services and training to support mapping and data\ncollection,  planning  and  management,  budgeting  and  accounting  (including  training  for\naccountants), implementing, monitoring and supervising, and reporting the integrated package\nof school construction, school support, and teacher training programs. One qualified assistant\nwill  be  provided  to  each  of  six  PESs  that  will  deliver  the  integrated  package  of  school\nconstruction,  school  support,  and  teacher  training  programs.  This  assistant  will  spend\nconsiderable  time  working  at  the  DEB  level  assisting  with  local  level  planning,  budgeting,\nimplementing,  monitoring  and  supervising,  and  reporting  activities.  One  additional  qualified\nassistant will be appointed to each PUCDA in four project provinces to help plan and supervise\nconstruction. A national project engineering consultant stationed at MOE will provide consulting\nservices and training to each PUCDA in managing and monitoring the construction program.\nThe Project will support PUCDA staff for their site visits to plan and supervise construction.\nOperational  budgets  and  equipment  will  be  provided  to  each  PES,  PUCDA,  and  DEB.  In\naddition, new DEB offices will be built in up to 55 of the 61 project districts that do not currently\nhave permanent offices. Furniture and equipment will be provided.\nC. Cost Estimates\n70. The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $37.6  million  equivalent,  of  which  an\nestimated $13.2 million, or 35 percent, is the foreign exchange cost. The local currency cost is\nestimated at $24.4 million equivalent or 65 percent of the total cost. A summary of the cost\nestimates is shown in Table 1, and details are given in Appendix 5.\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nComponent Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n71. It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $20 million equivalent from its Special Funds\nresources to finance 53 percent of the total project cost. The ADB loan will be repayable over 32\nyears with a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum\nduring the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. The borrower will be the Lao\nPDR. Sida is expected to provide a grant of about $9.6 million to cofinance, on a parallel basis,\na part of Component 1: Improving the Quality of Teaching and Learning (the building teacher\ntraining  system  and  teacher  development  capacity  subcomponent)  including  consulting\nservices, equipment, staff development, materials, operation and maintenance, and costs for\nproject reviews and supervisions. ADB and Sida together will fund 100 percent of the foreign\nexchange cost, totaling 35 percent of the estimated project cost, and 67 percent of the local\ncurrency  cost.  The  Government  and  communities  will  provide  the  remaining  $8  million\nequivalent  as  counterpart  financing.  This  includes  financing  in  kind  by  local  communities;\nprovision of land for new schools and offices; sharing the cost of teacher upgrading and in-\nservice training; provision of materials and labor for civil works; taxes and duties; and operation\nand maintenance of project facilities. Project costs that will become recurrent costs for the\nGovernment after project completion, such as teachers salaries, school funds, and in-service\ntraining costs, are included as part of the counterpart funds.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percent\nADB 8.4 11.6 20.0 53\nSida 4.8 4.8 9.6 26\nGovernment and Community 0.0 8.0 8.0 21\nTotal 13.2 24.4 37.6 100\nADB = Asian Development Bank; Sida = Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n72. Since the items to be financed under the Project, by their nature, have a large local cost\ncomponent, the Project will require local cost financing from ADB for $11.6 million, equivalent to\n58.0 percent of the ADB loan. This provision of financing for local currency cost is considered\njustified  under  ADB\u2019s  local  currency  financing  policy.18  From  an  economic  perspective,\nassistance is required to meet the local currency cost of development projects because a low\nlevel of per capita income constraints national savings and public finance is under pressure. The\nGovernment is taking steps to improve the rate of national savings by enhancing revenue\ncollection, and improving the efficiency of public expenditure and incentives for private sector\nparticipation in revenue-generating public sector projects. Although these efforts are expected to\nincrease national savings, a significant resource gap will continue for some time because of the\nneed  for  large  capital  investments.  Thus,  ADB  assistance  for  local  currency  expenditures\nrelated to the Project from the economic perspective is justified. From a technical perspective,\nthe high level of financing of local currency costs is justified because (i) many small civil works\nare scattered over numerous rural sites, most of which will utilize locally produced materials;\nand (ii) the Project is funding the delivery of in-country teacher training programs, and the\nrecruitment of domestic consultants and local contract staff.\n                  \n18R1-95: A Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditure on Projects. 3 January 1995.", "23\nE. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Project Management\n73. MOE, the Executing Agency for the Project, will have overall responsibility for Project\ncoordination  and  implementation.  An  MOE  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  minister  of\neducation, will be responsible for overseeing project implementation and will be maintained to\nthe satisfaction of ADB during the Project. The steering committee will include representatives\nof the Ministry of Finance and Committee for Planning and Cooperation. MOE\u2019s DPC will liaise\nwith  ADB  and  Sida  during  project  implementation,  and  coordinate  with  the  MOE  steering\ncommittee. DPC will also be in charge of overall coordination, monitoring, and supervision of\nproject activities. A PIU will be formed under DTT, which will implement the Project including\nteacher training and development programs, and other project activities. The PIU will comprise\nsenior staff of DTT, other concerned MOE departments, TDC, and NRIES, specifically assigned\nto  implement  project  activities  at  the  central  level.  The  PIU  was  established  prior  to  loan\nnegotiations and will be maintained to the satisfaction of ADB and Sida during the Project. The\nPIU will have overall responsibility for planning, budgeting, monitoring, and reporting, and will\ncoordinate  the  work  of  the  PPIUs  and  DPIUs.  The  PIU  will  also  coordinate  the  work  of\nconsultants financed by ADB and Sida. The Project will provide two qualified assistants with\nbudgeting and accounting, and reporting skills to the PIU to assist with project implementation.\nThe Project will provide equipment and operating resources for the PIU.\n74. Many project activities will be delegated to the TTC, PES, and DEB levels. The PPIUs\nwill be set up in the PES to coordinate, plan, implement, monitor, and supervise, and report on\nproject  activities  at  the  provincial  level,  while  the  DPIUs  at  DEBs  will  be  responsible  for\nimplementing project activities at the district level including school data collection and funds for\nprimary schools. The PPIUs and DPIUs will be established and staffed to the satisfaction of\nADB on the following time schedule: (i) for the PPIUs in the initial six project provinces (Bokeo,\nChampassak, Louang Phrabang, Savannakhet, Sayaburi, and Vientiane), within three months\nof loan effectiveness; (ii) for the PPIUs in the final three project provinces (Louang Namtha,\nSaravane, and Xieng Khouang) at least three months prior to the third anniversary of loan\neffectiveness; and (iii) the DPIU in each of the 70 project districts, (a) for the 12 project districts\nin phase 1, within six months of loan effectiveness, (b) for the 12 project districts in phase 2, no\nlater than three months after the first anniversary of loan effectiveness, (c) for the 37 project\ndistricts  in  phase  3,  no  later  than  three  months  after  the  second  anniversary  of  loan\neffectiveness, and (d) for the 9 project districts in phase 4, no later than three months after the\nthird anniversary of loan effectiveness.\n75. Both PPIUs and DPIUs will be staffed by existing PES and DEB personnel, and thus will\nbe mainstreamed within existing institutions. However, one additional qualified assistant will be\nprovided to each PES of the initial six project provinces and one to each PUCDA in four project\nprovinces where school construction activities will be undertaken under the Project. In addition,\neach PPIU will be responsible for coordination, monitoring, and supervision of Project activities\nin the districts. It will also be responsible via PUCDA for the coordination and management of\nconstruction activities. Each DPIU will be responsible for the implementation of district project\nactivities, including school data collection, management of primary school in-service training,\nand management of the construction and school funds. The PPIUs and DPIUs will all have\nmonitoring  responsibilities  and  will  be  responsible  for  financial  and  technical  reporting  of\nactivities in their areas. The Project will provide equipment and operating resources for the\nPPIUs, PUCDAs, DEBs, and DPIUs.", "24\n2.  Implementation Schedule\n76. The Project will be implemented over six years from January 2002 and is expected to be\ncompleted by 31 December 2007. The involvement of districts will be phased in line with the\nmanagement capacity of the PESs and DEBs. The implementation schedule for the Project is in\nAppendix 6.\n3. Procurement of Goods and Services\n77. All  ADB-financed  procurement  for  the  Project  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. The PIU will be responsible for procurement under the guidance\nand  supervision  of  the  MOE  steering  committee.  Procurement  for  the  Sida-supported\ncomponent  (Component  1:  the  building  teacher  training  system  and  teacher  development\ncapacity  subcomponent)  will  be  carried  out  by  Sida  in  accordance  with  its  procurement\nguidelines. Indicative procurement packages are in Appendix 7.\na. Equipment and Materials\n78. Each contract for supply of goods, equipment, and materials estimated to cost $500,000\nor more will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding procedures, while\ncontract  packages  of  less  than  $500,000  equivalent  will  follow  international  shopping\nprocedures.  Contracts  less  than  $100,000  may  be  procured  on  a  direct  purchase  basis.\nProcurement of library books, maps, and posters will be made locally.\nb. Civil Works\n79. Civil work packages for TTC facilities upgrading, school buildings, and DEB offices\nunder the Project are small and often situated in remote areas. These are unlikely to attract the\ninterest of international contractors. Therefore, civil works contracts less than $1.0 million will be\nawarded on the basis of local competitive bidding acceptable to ADB. However, if any contract\nis estimated to cost more than $1.0 million, international competitive bidding procedures will be\nfollowed.\n80. Many of the minor civil works (estimated at less than $10,000 per school) to rehabilitate,\ncomplete, or extend school buildings and facilities will be carried out by local communities using\npart of the construction funds. These civil works tend to be located in remote and rural sites with\nassociated difficulties in material delivery, and are unlikely to attract international or domestic\ncontractors and suppliers. Experience of ongoing minor civil works in the Lao PDR being\nsupported by NGOs indicates that community-managed school construction ensures greater\ntransparency, accountability, and cost effectiveness; and better ownership and maintenance by\nthe communities. Therefore, minor civil works packages for school construction or rehabilitation\nmay be procured locally by the beneficiary schools or communities if such packages (i) do not\nexceed an estimated cost of $60,000 per package or $10,000 per school, (ii) are not attractive\nto private contractors, and (iii) the capacity of the school or community has been determined to\nbe adequate based on the following procedure for community participation in procurement. The\nprocedure for community participation in procurement will be as follows: (i) in each project\nprovince, the PUCDA at the PES will explain the civil work packages and the community\nmatching funds for school rehabilitation to the DEB; (ii) the DEB will explain the requirements for\ncommunity participation in procurement to interested communities and will prepare a district\nschool construction plan including the use of the community matching funds and an assessment\nof the capacity of each community that indicates its interest in undertaking the work; (iii) the\nPUCDA and the Education Construction Service at MOE will review and approve the district\nschool construction plan; (iv) the PUCDA and DEB will enter into discussions with the local", "25\ncommunity  based  on  the  district  school  construction  plan;  and  (v)  based  on  the  review\ndiscussions and the criteria in the district school construction plan, the PES will award a contract\nto communities assessed to have sufficient capacity to undertake the work, subject to ADB\nconcurrence.  The  civil  works  under  the  community  participation  will  be  supervised  by  the\nPUCDA and DEB in close cooperation with the district construction engineer to be recruited\nunder the Project. Payment will be made from the project imprest account in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook dated January 2001.\n4. Consulting Services, Fellowship, Training, and Studies\n81. The Project will use consultants to build the capacity of MOE\u2019s technical departments,\nand the PESs and DEBs involved in the Project. It will also use specialists in teacher training\nand development to help develop and supervise teacher training programs in TDC and TTCs.\nWithin three months of loan effectiveness, MOE will submit the evaluation criteria, shortlists,\nterms  of  reference,  invitation  letters,  and  draft  contracts  for  recruitment  of  ADB-supported\nconsultants to ADB for review and approval. Approximately, 205 person-months of international\nconsulting will be needed (47 person-months financed by ADB and 158 person-months by\nSida); 1,671 person-months of domestic consulting (1,512 person-months financed by ADB and\n159 person-months by Sida). This includes district construction engineers to be engaged for a\ntotal  of  984  person-months  to  supervise  civil  works  activities.  Local  contract  staff  will  be\nengaged for a total of 1,014 person-months to support the PIU at MOE, the PIUs and PUCDAs\nat the PES, and the DPIUs (678 person-months financed by ADB and 336 person-months\nfinanced by Sida). All international and domestic consultants, and local contract staff financed\nby ADB will be selected and engaged by the Government through a firm in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB\nconcerning  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants  and  local  contract  staff.  Consultants\nfinanced by Sida (Component 1: the building teacher training system and teacher development\ncapacity subcomponent) will be selected and engaged by Sida through a firm on a tied basis\nand administered by Sida in accordance with Sida\u2019s guidelines. The award of all consulting\ncontracts  or  specialist  subcontract  services  for  ADB-financed  studies,  monitoring,  and\nevaluation, or any activity for an amount greater than the equivalent of $10,000 will be subject to\nprior approval by ADB. For international training supported by Sida, the selection and award of\nfellowships  will  follow  Sida  guidelines.  The  PIU,  under  the  guidance  of  the  MOE  steering\ncommittee and in coordination with DPC, will be responsible for coordination between ADB- and\nSida-financed consultants. Consulting service requirements and outline terms of reference for\nconsultants are in Appendix 8.\n5. Disbursement Procedures\n82. To expedite project implementation through the timely release of ADB\u2019s share of funds\nfor eligible expenditures, an imprest account will be established at the Bank of Lao PDR under\nthe authority of the Ministry of Finance within three months of loan effectiveness. The imprest\naccount will be established, operated, and liquidated in accordance with detailed arrangements\nagreed upon by the Borrower and ADB and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement\nHandbook dated January 2001. The imprest account will be used mainly for financing local\ncurrency expenditures, including indirect foreign exchange costs and some small expenditures\nin foreign currency. The initial deposit will be $170,000, which is the amount estimated to cover\nanticipated expenditures to meet the financing of eligible items under the imprest account in a\nsix-month  period.  Items  eligible  for  financing  through  the  imprest  account  include  staff\ndevelopment, consultants and specialists, civil works, equipment and furniture, materials, and\nproject implementation costs. Because project activities will take place in dispersed geographic\nareas where communication and transportation are difficult, simple mechanisms are required to\ndisburse  small  funds  quickly  through  decentralized  decision  making  while  maintaining", "26\nacceptable  levels  of  financial  control.  Accordingly,  subaccounts  will  be  established  and\nmanaged in MOE and in the PESs following the same guidelines. The initial amount in MOE will\nnot exceed $50,000 and in each of the six PESs will not exceed $20,000. The Ministry of\nFinance has concurred with this arrangement. Statement of expenditure procedures with a\nceiling of $50,000 per payment will be permitted.\n6. Accounts and Auditing\n83. The Government, acting through MOE, will maintain records and accounts adequate to\nidentify goods and services financed from the proceeds of the loan. The PESs will also maintain\naccounts for relevant project activities following the same standards. MOE will (i) maintain\nseparate records and accounts for the Project; (ii) ensure that accounts and financial statements\nare audited in accordance with international auditing standards by auditors acceptable to ADB;\nand (iii) provide ADB, not later than 12 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified\ncopies of audited accounts and financial statements and the report of the auditor on these. ADB\nmay ask the Government to arrange for an independent audit, either local (National Audit Office)\nor international, to be financed from loan proceeds.\n7. Reporting\n84. The PIU will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation and submit them to\nADB and Sida through DPC within 30 days of the end of each respective quarter. The reports\nwill be in a format acceptable to ADB and Sida, and will indicate, among other things, (i) the\nprogress made against established targets; (ii) problems encountered during the quarter, and\nsteps taken and proposed to be taken to resolve the problems; (iii) compliance with loan\ncovenants;  and  (iv)  proposed  program  activities  to  be  undertaken  during  the  succeeding\nquarter. The PIU will prepare a project completion report and submit it to ADB through DPC not\nlater than three months following physical completion of the Project. The report will include the\ncosts and compliance with loan covenants.\n8. Project Performance\na. Annual Operational Plans and Financial Reviews\n85. To facilitate project implementation, four months before the start of each fiscal year, the\nGovernment will prepare an annual operational plan for the next Government fiscal year. The\nannual operational plan will include (i) the status of the policy framework; (ii) the proposed\nallocations to the education sector; (iii) financial plan for central and provincial levels for the\ncounterpart funds and recurrent project expenditures; (iv) fully costed project activities for each\nsubcomponent, with performance targets; and (v) details of how proposed project activities are\nto be integrated into the subsector\u2019s ongoing programs. This will ensure a coherent coordinated\napproach to the development of primary and secondary education and will help to avoid any\nduplication of efforts. Further, the annual operational plan will confirm that the Government has\nallocated adequate resources for project implementation and recurrent budget for the Project.\nb. Project Monitoring and Evaluation\n86. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation, monitoring,\nsupervision,  and  evaluation  will  be  built  into  the  project  activities  to  ensure  that  both  the\nimplementation of activities and their impact are kept under constant review. Key items to be\nmonitored are (i) the impact of training activities on the conduct of training and the impact of the\ntraining  on  the  performance  of  teachers  and  children;  (ii)  the  use  and  benefits  of  district\nconstruction funds to improve access to education; (iii) the distribution and use of school funds", "27\nand their impact on participation in education and children\u2019s learning; and (iv) the ability of the\nPIUs, especially at PES and DEB levels to manage project activities. Key personnel will be\nidentified to conduct this monitoring and evaluation. All technical departments at the MOE, PES,\nand DEB levels, and consultants and specialists assisting those departments will be charged\nwith designing monitoring activities and expanding the existing indicators. A particular focus of\nmonitoring will be on school improvement. Communities, schools (especially school principals),\nand PAs will be trained to monitor the implementation of project activities in their areas and their\nimpact  on  schools  and  their  children.  Project  resources  have  been  allocated  to  support\nmonitoring visits and workshops to report on and discuss the results of monitoring and plan\nfollow-up  activities  based  on  the  results  of  the  monitoring.  Civil  works  activities  will  be\nintensively supervised and monitored. Construction engineers will be stationed in each district\nand a project engineer in each province. They will closely monitor and supervise the preparation\nand implementation of construction activities in their areas. They will be coordinated by a\nnational project engineer to review the progress.\n87. The impact indicators will be kept to a minimum and focus on the prime objectives of the\nProject: (i) increasing the supply and quality of teachers\u2014the indicators will measure changes in\nthe supply and qualifications of teachers; and the impact of project activities on teacher training\nand on teaching and learning in project classrooms, and changes in working conditions, career\nstructures,  and  accreditation  procedures  for  teachers;  (ii)  increasing  equitable  access  and\nparticipation in primary education in the project areas\u2014the indicators will measure changes in\nenrollment, dropouts, and repetition, focusing especially on the proportion of children entering\ngrade 5, particularly with reference to ethnic minorities and girls; and (iii) improving education\nmanagement\u2014the  focus  will  be  on  the  timeliness  and  efficiency  of  the  planning,\nimplementation, and monitoring of project inputs. To monitor the performance of TTCs, TDC will\ndevelop monitoring indicators for TTCs and teaching improvements. The impact on student\nperformance will be measured by a special study to be undertaken in three stages at the\nbeginning, middle, and end of the Project to measure changes in student performance in basic\nliteracy and numeracy.\n9. Midterm Review\n88. In addition to regular review, the Government, Sida, and ADB will jointly conduct a\nmidterm review after the third year of project implementation. The review will be assisted by\ninternational and domestic consultants including a midterm review specialist. All aspects of the\nProject will be reviewed including the project scope, design and implementation arrangements,\nand compliance with loan conditions and covenants. The review will focus in particular on a\nnumber of activities that were carried out to determine how these should be continued or\nchanged during the subsequent phases. The review will recommend areas for changes in\nproject design or implementation, if any.\n89. More specifically, the midterm review will focus on implementation of the access and\nparticipation component, in particular to assess the degree of decentralization of the planning\nand  implementation  of  activities  to  provinces  and  districts,  and  the  implementation  of\nconstruction in the districts and of the matching grant programs for local communities. It will\nreview the funds to schools to encourage learning and participation to determine if these funds\nshould be continued and possibly expanded to more schools. Specific attention will be given to\ntargets to increase the number of children entering grade 5. In the quality component, the\nimplementation of in-service training programs will be reviewed to assess which models are\nproving most successful and whether they can be extended to new areas. Progress in improving\nthe quality of the TTCs will also be reviewed. The review will examine the progress of the\nTPWG and the extent to which the Government progressed toward adopting and implementing\nits  proposals  to  reform  teacher  incentives  including  salaries  and  working  conditions,  and", "28\nsimilarly examine progress of certification of preservice, upgrading, and in-service training. The\nmidterm review will assess the results of the studies that have taken place and the extent to\nwhich the lessons learned have been implemented.\nF. The Executing Agency\n90. MOE will be the Executing Agency for the Project and will have overall responsibility for\ncoordinating and implementing project activities. MOE implemented the ADB-funded EQIP and\nthe  World  Bank-financed  EDP,  and  is  currently  implementing  two  ADB-funded  education\nprojects, the BEGP and the Postsecondary Education Rationalization Project (footnote 2). The\nimplementation of these projects is generally successful; although start-up of the projects and\ncivil work programs have experienced some delay. Although MOE\u2019s performance is considered\nadequate for project implementation, long-term assistance with project implementation through\nan international consultant and local qualified assistants is required. In addition, many activities\nwill be delegated to the PES and DEB levels as part of the decentralization of education\nmanagement. The Project will provide project implementation support at these administrative\nlevels.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n91. Environmental impacts of the Project were reviewed and no significant adverse impacts\nwere identified. However, any environmental consideration will be incorporated into all project-\nfunded school construction during implementation. The designs of the new schools will promote\nthe use of local materials and require minimum maintenance. The buildings will be designed\nbased on climate and community requirements. Rehabilitated buildings and extensions of old\nbuildings will be of minimum standard and will not negatively impact the environment. Emphasis\nwill also be strongly placed on water supply (for drinking and toilets) to promote good health and\nenvironmental sanitation for students and teachers in any new construction. Where new land is\nrequired, the following steps will be followed. First, available public land will be identified with\nthe assistance of the village chief. If it is not available or unsuitable, private land without\nstructures and not being used for agricultural or other productive purposes will be identified and\npurchased through market transactions. The community may contribute land if the PUCDA and\nDEB staff, together with the village chief, confirm that (i) the land has no encroachers, squatters,\nor other encumbrances; (ii) the contribution of land area is not more than 5 percent of the\ncontributor\u2019s total landholding; (iii) the contributors are not poor; (iv) if any loss of production or\nphysical  displacement  is  envisaged,  which  should  not  be  significant,  community-based\nmitigation measures are proposed to the affected people before they make the decision; and\n(v) verbal or written agreement by all the contributors and affected people is obtained. If all\nthese conditions cannot be met, which is unlikely, a short resettlement plan will be prepared by\nthe PIU in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement19 and will be submitted to\nADB for approval. The DEBs will monitor that community matching grants and school funds are\nnot directly spent for land acquisition. The PUCDA staff will be required to have experience in\nenvironmental  and  resource  management.  MOE  staff  will  receive  hands-on  training  in\nenvironmental promotion. Before any new construction, the site will be reviewed by the PUCDA\nstaff and project engineers as to its suitability.\n                  \n19 ADB. 1998. The Bank\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. In Handbook on Resettlement. Appendix 1. Manila.", "29\n2. Social Analysis\na.  Gender and Ethnic Minorities\n92. A social analysis was undertaken in six provinces that examined attitudes to education\nfor girls and the situation for ethnic minorities. Focus group discussions held with women\u2019s\ngroups, community leaders, teachers, and students were used to complement the findings of a\nlarge-scale survey covering 79 villages in 27 districts of 12 provinces carried out for the BEGP.\nThe findings pointed out that the dropout rate among girls is still very high and that girls attend\nall levels of education at lower rates than boys. Many girls especially repeat primary school\ngrade 1, and also dropout during the transition from the nearby incomplete school to a distant\ncomplete school. The social analysis indicates the following major constraints and obstacles to\ngirls\u2019 education: poverty, double responsibilities of girls within the family, distances to school,\nlack of perceived returns in educating girls, cultural beliefs, and early marriages among ethnic\nminorities.  The  Project\u2019s  primary  school  construction  program  will  shorten  the  distance  to\nschool. Based on community demands, the Project will also provide funds to construct day-care\ncenters and recruit female community assistants to these centers, so that girls do not have to\nmiss school to take care of their younger siblings.\n93. As a direct consequence of the low number of female graduates, the number of female\nteachers is fewer than male teachers. Among the ethnic minority communities, the gender gap\nfor teachers is much larger. Female teachers face special constraints. For example, many\nfemale teachers at the primary grade 1 level have class sizes of 110 and above. School funds\nprovided by the Project may be used to recruit community teaching assistants (mostly female) to\nassist such teachers in the overcrowded classrooms and to alleviate their burden and improve\nteaching quality for both boys and girls. Where teacher training facilities are constructed or\nupgraded, day-care centers will be encouraged to be built to address the needs of female staff\nand teachers. Upgrading of incomplete schools to complete schools will also help reduce the\nisolation of teachers in incomplete schools who are mainly female. Targeted training including a\npreparatory course is included to upgrade the qualifications of unqualified teachers, especially\nfemale teachers. Further, the Project will hire about 1,200 new locally recruited teachers, of\nwhich at least 50 percent will be female.\n94. The educational status is much lower among the non-Lao ethnic minority groups. While\nthe focus group discussions indicate an overwhelming interest in education opportunities for sons\nand daughters where schools already exist, this may not be the case where schools currently do\nnot exist. In fact, besides access problems, low educational status of parents and lack of parents\u2019\nunderstanding of the value of education especially for girls appear to be among the major\nconstraints to ethnic minority education. Under the Project, specific measures have been carefully\nconsidered to promote recruitment of ethnic minority teachers who teach in the same villages. In\nmany cases, ethnic minority students travel long distances to attend schools. The Project\u2019s access\ncomponent will begin to address this problem and open up access for students who have not had\nopportunities in the past. Ethnic minority students need to have relevant curriculum; this is being\nconsidered at the early grades to reduce dropouts. A gender and ethnic minority strategy has\nbeen developed for the Project, and is summarized in Appendix 9.\nb. Community Participation\n95. The focus group discussions identified that in most places, communities are playing\nmajor roles in primary education, including (i) advocating enrollment and education benefits,\nespecially for girls; (ii) boosting morale of school staff; (iii) raising money, local materials, and\ncontributing labor for school construction and rehabilitation; (iv) providing vendor services for\nlunch; (v) identifying suitable land for school construction (a role usually played by the village", "30\nchief); (vi) monitoring students\u2019 school attendance; (vii) monitoring teachers\u2019 attendance and\nperformance; (viii) asking the DEB to recruit teachers; (ix) providing local cultural information to\nteachers coming from outside; (x) providing security for teachers by preparing adequate housing\nfor them; and (xi) ensuring school schedules meet local realities. Where complete primary\nschools already exist, a formal or informal school committee often meets monthly, comprising\nschool principals, teachers, village chief, and community representatives. The LWU can also\nplay a major role in raising the awareness of the community and school staff of the importance\nof girls\u2019 education, education that meets ethnic minority needs, and school nutrition programs.\nThe Project will strengthen partnerships between the community and schools through training,\nschool  management  planning,  and  provision  of  community  and  school  funds.  Participatory\nmonitoring by the communities of the use of funds will be also carried out to ensure the\naccountability and sustainability of community-based school management, which will improve\nthe quality of primary education.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA. Socioeconomic Analysis\n1. Direct Beneficiaries\n96. Many teachers will benefit from new and improved training programs. These programs\nwill include over 2,000 graduates annually from the TTCs who will emerge better fitted for\nteaching; 2,400 unqualified teachers who will be trained and become qualified and able to teach\ntheir students better; and approximately 15,000 primary school teachers, 2,500 primary school\nprincipals, 3,000 secondary school teachers, and 500 secondary school principals who will take\npart in regular and repeated in-service training that will benefit their pupils and lead to enhanced\nperformance. This covers 55 percent of primary school teachers and 30 percent of secondary\nschool teachers in the country. In addition, 365 TTC trainers, 108 TUP trainers, 473 primary\nschool PAs, and 144 secondary school PAs will be trained on a regular and repeated basis.\nThis  will  in  turn  ensure  the  quality  of  the  preservice,  upgrading,  and  in-service  training\nprograms.\n97. The Project\u2019s access component will operate in poor, underserved areas in the selected\n41 districts. The Project will greatly increase the opportunity for children in these districts to\nreceive a full five-year primary education by building approximately 45 classrooms in each\ndistrict. The emphasis will be on upgrading the incomplete schools to complete schools, as\ndropout is high for the early grades. The Project will also ensure that children obtain a better\nquality primary education by assigning new teachers who will be trained through the Project. For\nprimary education, more than 400,000 students will be studying in the project-assisted schools\nby the end of the Project; about 30,000 in newly constructed or newly completed primary\nschools.  Through  in-service  teacher  training  and  upgrading  of  unqualified  teachers  in  an\nadditional  29  selected  districts  where  teacher  training  alone  will  be  implemented,  another\n150,000  primary  and  secondary  students  will  benefit  from  improved  education  quality.\nFurthermore, the improvements to preservice training through the TTCs will benefit students\nnationwide. Girls and ethnic minority children will especially benefit both through geographical\ntargeting and special assistance provided by the Project.\n2. Efficiency Benefits\n98. The Project will ensure that the education system is more responsive to local needs. It\nwill, for example, ensure that schools are built of an appropriate minimum size in locations\nwhere they are needed, and that communities are able to maintain and support these schools.", "31\nThe Project will also ensure that teachers, learning materials, and operation and maintenance\nsupport are available in these schools. It will train new and existing teachers in more practical\nand relevant teaching methods, and primary schools will focus on basic literacy, numeracy, and\nmulti-grade teaching. This will ensure that teachers in the future will be more able to address the\nbasic needs of students, which will reduce dropouts and repetition and increase the number of\nschool  graduates,  while  simultaneously  decreasing  the  number  of  person-years  needed  to\nproduce each graduate. Economic analysis, including the assessment of cost-effectiveness and\ninternal efficiency gains, is in Appendix 10.\n3. Institutional Strengthening\n99. Considerable inputs will be made to upgrade institutional capacity at the MOE, PES, and\nDEB levels. Concerned staff of MOE, PESs, and DEBs will be given considerable training in\ndata collection, planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting of project\nactivities. MOE, NRIES, NUOL, TTC, and TDC staff will take part in graduate degree training.\nTTC management staff will be given training and on-the-job support by consultants to enable\nthem to manage their colleges more effectively and efficiently. Teachers, principals, trainers,\nand senior staff at MOE, PESs, and DEBs will enhance their understanding of good practices\nlearned from study tours to neighboring countries. Awareness raising on gender and ethnic\nminority issues in education management and delivery will be provided to relevant target groups\nby the MOE\u2019s GEMEU.\n100. The  Project  will  also  assist  the  Government  in  strengthening  the  management  of\neducation, in particular in developing appropriate management structures and capabilities at\nprovince,  district,  and  village  levels,  thereby  supporting  the  Government\u2019s  decentralization\ninitiatives. It will introduce construction funds to enable districts to plan, manage, and implement\ntheir  own  construction  programs,  and  will  support  the  devolution  of  the  implementation  of\ntraining  activities  to  provinces  and  districts.  It  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  TTCs  to\nmanage and deliver pre- and in-service teacher training, and will help them expand their role to\ncontinuing education for the community, based on local demand. The Project will strengthen the\nplanning capacity of MOE departments involved in teacher training and development, and help\nthem with strategic planning for prioritizing expenditures through a variety of operational studies,\nand monitoring and evaluation activities. It will also assist MOE with its efforts to institute\nimproved  salaries  and  working  conditions  for  teachers.  It  will  work  with  other  assistance\nagencies, especially the World Bank, to establish better data collection systems and to train\nconcerned staff in planning and budgeting. Although most project activities will be delivered\nthrough existing delivery systems, the Project will strengthen these systems and the capability\nof their staff to plan, manage, monitor and evaluate, and report their activities.\n4. Sustainability\n101. Adequate measures have been incorporated into the Project to ensure its sustainability\nafter implementation. As a prerequisite to project participation, communities must be willing to\nsupport schools constructed in their areas including assisting with construction, operation, and\nmaintenance, and mobilizing their students. Recognizing that communities, especially those in\npoorer areas cannot be expected to cover the full cost of their children\u2019s education, the Project\nwill provide school funds to support local management of resources. This model is expected to\nbe taken over by the Government and to become the norm for all schools in the country. The\nProject  will  develop  training  capacity  at  TTCs  that  will  become  the  source  of  the  future\ngenerations of teachers. The Project will also take advantage of low-cost models of in-service\nteacher  training,  in  particular  using  primary  school  clusters  and  the  NTUCs.  Government\ncounterpart funding is being mainly allocated to: the funding of new teachers for schools built by\nthe Project, school funds, upgrading of unqualified teachers, and in-service teacher training. As", "32\na percentage of total education spending, this accounts for about 2.6 percent of projected\nrecurrent expenditure for basic education spending and is sustainable after the end of the\nProject, even under conditions of modest GDP and education budget growth. The Government\nwill provide counterpart funding for civil works. This financial contribution will equal an estimated\n8 percent of total domestic investment in the education sector during project implementation.\n102. The  success  and  sustainability  of  the  Project  depends  on  ongoing  reforms  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s education finance policy. Central to this is a commitment to increase recurrent\nspending to levels that are more in line with regional standards. This is necessary to ensure that\n(i) higher salaries are paid to teachers to encourage teachers to remain in their jobs, (ii) new\nteachers are hired to meet growing enrollment, and (iii) investments made by the Project in new\nand rehabilitated infrastructure will be properly maintained. ADB engaged in long-term dialogue\nwith Government and assistance agencies during project preparation concerning the need to\nincrease recurrent spending on education to regional norms. Based on reasonable assumptions\n(including  a  5.5  percent  real  GDP  growth  per  annum  and  a  gradual  increase  in  the\nGovernment\u2019s education budget share up to 15 percent of total expenditure), the Government\nwill  be  able  to  meet  these  challenges  to  the  education  sector.  These  assumptions  are\nconservative, given the Lao PDR\u2019s recent economic performance and the assumptions included\nin the Government report presented at the seventh Roundtable Meeting, November 2000. The\nGovernment has given further assurances that the social sectors, including education, will be\ngiven increasing priority. One sign of this commitment has been a recent substantial increase in\nteachers\u2019 salaries, which is expected to be followed-up by an additional increase in the next two\nto three years.\nB. Impact on Poverty and Gender\n103. The Project is classified as poverty intervention. The Project will promote significant\nintergenerational improvements raising income and reducing poverty among families in the\ntarget  districts.  With  the  component  packaging  under  the  Project,  the  proportion  of  poor\nbeneficiaries of the Project will be higher than the national poverty incidence level. This estimate\nis  based  on  certain  assumptions  on  prioritized  outreach  of  teacher  training  and  school\ncompletions associated with the project design and focus that lead to the Project having a\nhigher poverty impact (on a headcount basis) than the national poverty incidence level of 38.6\npercent (footnote 7). While the whole country can be considered poor, the Project is envisaged\nto disproportionately benefit those living below the poverty line. Children who graduate from\nprimary education are likely to be more productive than their parents. Educated farmers are\nbetter equipped to adopt new practices that will raise crop yields; they are more likely to improve\ntheir animal husbandry practices and adopt more modern methods of sustainable agriculture\nand forest management. In addition, reasonable levels of literacy and numeracy are immediate\nbenefits to those in trade and cash generating activities. Once educated, their career aspirations\nmay improve, and the receptiveness to new ideas, information, and technology will increase.\nEconomic analysis including poverty impact of the Project is in Appendix 10.\n104. Further the improvements to preservice teacher training through the TTCs will benefit\nstudents nationwide. The focus of the training for primary teachers is to improve (i) basic literacy\nand numeracy, especially in the early grades, and (ii) implementation of multigrade teaching,\nwhere appropriate. In these areas, failure in the early grades is one of major issues of the\nsystem, which leads to huge numbers of children repeating classes and dropping out of school.\nProject activities are expected to have a significant impact on reducing dropouts and repetitions,\nand increasing student performance in basic literacy and numeracy, especially in those poor,\nremote areas where these problems are at their greatest.", "33\n105. The Project\u2019s thematic classification is gender and development. Nearly 50 percent of\nstudents who will be studying in the project-assisted primary schools will be girls. Women will\nconstitute at least 50 percent of newly recruited or appointed teachers, new PAs, and trainees\nfor teacher training programs. Furthermore, better educational results, particularly for women,\nand more so for ethnic minority women, are expected to have significant social consequences,\nnamely improved maternal mortality rates; more widespread adoption of preventive, primary\nhealth care measures; and more acceptance of family planning methods. Through the improved\neducational results for girls, women, and ethnic minorities, as well as the emergence of more\nrole models of educated girls, the cultural barriers to girls\u2019 education including the perceived low\nreturn and cultural traditions such as early marriage are expected to change in the long term.\nThe specific measures to address gender issues have been included in the gender and ethnic\nminority strategy, which is in Appendix 9.\nC. Risks\n106. The Project covers a wide range of teacher training, construction, and management\nactivities at various administrative levels. Previous projects have faced delays because of the\nestablishment of new systems and procedures. This Project has tried as far as possible to build\non and collaborate with existing systems, for example, the PA system, school clusters, and the\nTUP-NTUC system for teacher training, and using PUCDAs to plan and supervise construction.\nHowever, it places a heavy responsibility on the PIU under DTT to effectively implement the\nProject by coordinating with other departments of MOE and concerned agencies, and PPIUs\nand DPIUs; and on DPC to provide overall project coordination including liaison with ADB, Sida,\nand other development partners. These responsibilities will challenge the capacity of these\nMOE departments. To address this concern, the Project will focus, during the first year of each\nof  four  phases,  on  working  in  a  limited  number  of  districts  to  develop  the  core  project\nmanagement and implementation capacity by providing extra staff, facilities, logistic support,\nand training. A second risk is increased recurrent costs, resulting mainly from operating and\nmaintaining new or rehabilitated complete primary schools, upgraded TTCs, and the large-scale\ntraining program covering primary and secondary teachers nationwide on a continuous basis.\nBased on likely financing scenarios during and beyond the project period, this risk is likely to be\nmanageable.\n107. The major development will be in the extent of the decentralization of planning and\nimplementing construction activities, and the fund channeling mechanisms needed to support\nthis. The project activities will be carefully phased with only eight districts taking part in the first\nstage of the construction activities. The first year activities consist mainly of planning and\npreparation. These districts and the PESs will be given substantial and concentrated consulting\nservices and training, particularly during the first two years of the Project, when all involved will\nbe  at  a  learning  stage.  The  DEBs  will  be  provided  with  district  construction  engineers  to\nsupervise the civil works, and budgets to support day-to-day operations, undertake fieldwork,\nand hold meetings.\n108. Previous projects have reported long delays in the approval of activities, as plans have\nhad to be referred to much higher levels, often to the minister of education. Delays have also\noccurred as funding mechanisms have not been in place to allow the flow of funds to the\nappropriate levels in the system in time. Procedures must be streamlined so that activities can\nbe implemented without long delays while waiting for approval, and that efficient mechanisms\nexist to channel sufficient funds to provinces, districts, clusters, and schools. This should be a\npriority of the Government during the pre-project implementation period.\n109. The involvement of communities in school construction and improvement has clearly\nbeen shown to be the most effective way of improving access to and participation in education,", "34\nand has a significant role in raising quality. To match the investment to the varying needs of\nlocal  communities,  several  different  initiatives  are  proposed,  including  funds  to  local\ncommunities  and  schools.  These  have  proved  effective  when  given  by  other  assistance\nagencies such as UNICEF and some NGOs, where close supervision has been exercised to\nensure that the use of the funds is well planned and executed. By the use of district construction\nengineers and project engineers, consulting services provided to MOE, PESs, and DEBs, and\nthe openness of the local community to monitor use of funds, the proposed schemes can be\nsimilarly effective under this Project.\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n110. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:\n.\n(i) The Government will make available an annual budget for education of at least\n12 percent of total Government expenditure in FY2001/02, at least 13 percent in\nFY2003/04,  and  for  the  medium  term,  up  to  a  minimum  of  15  percent  by\nFY2005/06.\n(ii) The PPIU in each of six provinces (Bokeo, Champassak, Louang Phrabang,\nSavannakhet, Sayaburi, and Vientiane) will be established and staffed to the\nsatisfaction to ADB within three months of loan effectiveness.\n(iii)  The PPIU in each of three provinces (Louang Namtha, Saravan, and Xieng\nKhouang) will be established and staffed to the satisfaction of ADB at least three\nmonths prior to the third anniversary of loan effectiveness;\n(iv)  The  DPIU  in  each  project  district  will  be  established  and  staffed  to  the\nsatisfaction of ADB on the following schedule: (a) for the 12 project districts in\nphase 1, within six months of loan effectiveness; (b) for the 12 project districts in\nphase  2,  no  later  than  three  months  after  the  first  anniversary  of  loan\neffectiveness; (c) for the 37 project districts in phase 3, no later than three\nmonths after the second anniversary of loan effectiveness; and (d) for the 9\nproject districts in phase 4, no later than three months after the third anniversary\nof loan effectiveness.\n(v)  MOE will prepare and submit to ADB an annual operational plan, including a\nproposed  financial  plan  for  the  central  and  provincial  counterpart  funds  and\nrecurrent expenditures of the Project, four months before the start of each fiscal\nyear of the Government during the Project.\n(vi)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, MOE will appoint all members of the\nTPWG including staff of the GEMEU satisfactory to ADB.\n(vii)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, MOE will appoint all members of the\ncurriculum and material development team satisfactory to ADB.\n(viii)  Each of the MOE steering committee, PIU at DTT, PPIUs, DPIUs, and TPWG,\nafter  it  is  established  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  this  report,  will  be\nmaintained during the Project.", "35\n(ix)  MOE will submit the list of project villages and schools (selected based on criteria\nacceptable  to  ADB)  to  ADB  for  review  and  approval  on  the  following  time\nschedule: (a) for villages and schools in the 12 project districts in phase 1, within\nsix months of loan effectiveness; (b) for the villages and schools in the twelve\nproject districts in phase 2, no later than three months after the first anniversary\nof loan effectiveness; (c) for the villages and schools in the 37 project districts in\nphase  3,  no  later  than  three  months  after  the  second  anniversary  of  loan\neffectiveness; and (d) for the villages and schools in the 9 project districts in\nphase  4,  no  later  than  three  months  after  the  third  anniversary  of  loan\neffectiveness;\n(x)  Within two years of loan effectiveness, MOE will develop guidelines satisfactory\nto ADB for certification of teachers and the National Teacher Education Advisory\nBoard will formally approve the guidelines; and\n(xi)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  environmental  and  social  considerations,\nincluding the existing laws and regulations of the Lao PDR; ADB\u2019s environmental\nguidelines  and  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement,  indigenous  peoples,  and\ngender and development; and the Project\u2019s gender and ethnic minority strategy\nare implemented for all project activities.\nB.

Component 1: Improving the Quality of Teaching and Learning\n1. Building Teacher Training System and Teacher Development Capacity 1\na. Teacher Education Strategy Development\n1. The Department of Teacher Training (DTT) of the Ministry of Education (MOE) will\nproduce a teacher education strategy paper within 18 months of loan effectiveness to the\nsatisfaction to the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The paper, among others, will address the need to reform the\nexisting preservice teacher training framework, based on a long-term teachers\u2019 supply and\ndemand analysis, and in light of the increasing role of teacher training colleges (TTCs) in in-\nservice teacher training programs. In addition, consulting services will be provided to support\nDTT,  Department  of  General  Education  (DGE),  National  Research  Institute  for  Education\nSciences (NRIES), teacher development center (TDC), Faculty of Education of the National\nUniversity of Laos (NUOL), and other MOE departments involved in teacher training to help\nthem review the priorities and develop more detailed and operational plans to achieve these\npriorities.\nb. Course Development\n2. A Coordinated Approach to Teacher Training. DTT will direct and coordinate the\ndevelopment of all teacher training programs. This will include ensuring that programs follow a\nset  of  objectives  agreed  by  all  the  various  stakeholders,  and  that  training  and  curriculum\nmaterials  are  shared  across  programs.  Staff  of  DTT,  DGE,  TDC,  NRIES,  NUOL,  TTCs,\npedagogical adviser (PA) master trainers, teacher upgrading program (TUP) trainers and PAs\nwill form a curriculum and materials development team and collaborate with TDC to develop the\nvarious curricula, guidelines, and supporting materials.\n3. Training  Needs  Assessment.  DTT,  working  with  the  curriculum  and  materials\ndevelopment team to be established within three months of loan effectiveness, will undertake a\ntraining needs assessment survey. This will include: visits to TTCs to review the effectiveness of\nthe implementation of the preservice teacher training curriculum developed under the Education\nQuality Improvement Project (EQIP)2; discussions with staff and students of TTCs; visits to the\nTUP and network teacher upgrading centers (NTUCs), school clusters, and schools to consult\nwith principals and teachers; and classrooms observations and discussions with PAs.\n4. Developing National Teacher Competencies. To monitor various training activities,\nclear outcomes of training must be defined, based on models of effective teaching as well as\nreal conditions prevailing in schools across the country. Such outcomes will be laid out in a list\nof national teacher competencies with core competencies required for teachers. Development of\nthe national teacher competencies will be the responsibility of TDC and the curriculum and\nmaterials development team. The competencies will be reviewed, discussed and refined during\nthe training of trainers and provincial and district training. They will be modified at annual\nworkshops. Monitoring and evaluation activities based on the national teacher competencies will\nbe designed during TTC staff, PA, academic teacher, and school principal training.\n                  \n1 Subject to minor adjustments according to the project agreement between the Government and the Swedish\nInternational Development Cooperation Agency, which will be finalised to the satisfaction of the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) prior to the effectiveness of ADB loan.\n2 Loan 1103-LAO: Education Quality Improvement Project, for $13.3 million, approved on 26 September 1991.", "48 Appendix 4, page 2\n5. Curriculum and Materials Development for All Training Courses. The curriculum\nand materials development team will develop training curricula and materials, using the national\nteacher competencies as their guide and according to certification guidelines as appropriate, for\n(i) preservice training at the TTCs, (ii) the TUP, (iii) PAs and academic teachers, (iv) school\nclusters, (v) secondary school principals, and (vi) TTC management staff. Training materials,\nincluding  curriculum  handbooks,  TTC  textbooks,  TUP,  and  PA  training  materials,  will  be\ndeveloped, produced, and delivered in sufficient quantities to support the implementation of\neach curriculum. The curricula and materials developed will need to be flexible enough to take\ninto account the diversity of needs and situations in the educational context of the country.\n6. Establishing  Guidelines  for  Certification  of  Teachers.  DTT,  working  with  DGE,\nDepartment of Personnel, TDC and TTCs, will develop guidelines for certification of teachers\ntaking part in preservice, upgrading programs, training of trainers, and in-service programs.\nThese  guidelines  will  include  consideration  of  the  learning  outcomes,  course  content,\nassessment strategies, and the national teacher competencies. The guidelines will be flexible in\norder to cater to the diversity of needs and situations in the country\u2019s educational context. Within\ntwo years of loan effectiveness, MOE will develop guidelines satisfactory to ADB for certification\nof teachers, and the National Teacher Education Advisory Board will formally approve the\nguidelines, for certification. New training courses will be developed according to the guidelines,\nand the existing training courses will be reviewed according to the guidelines. A database of\ncourse implementation and teacher participation in teacher training courses will be created at\nthe provincial education service (PESs).\nc. Training of Trainers\n7. The Project will as far as possible use and improve existing training structures with\nwhich the education management authorities are already familiar, rather than setting up totally\nnew structures. It will strengthen the system capacity to provide coherent teacher training\nprograms using the existing trainers. These include TTC staff, TUP trainers, secondary school\nPAs based in each province, primary school PAs based in each district, and academic teachers\nbased at the school cluster level. Training for PAs and academic teachers should focus on\nimproving the performance of schools and will reflect local priorities. The training will encourage\nparticipatory training, practical activities, and interactive methodology. The focus of the training\nfor primary schools will include multigrade teaching,3 where appropriate, and a school and\ncommunity-based  approach  to  problem  solving  in  schools  related  to  pupil  retention,  large\nclasses, and raising literacy and numeracy attainment.\n8. Master  and  Doctoral  Courses  for  TTC  and  Other  Staff.  A  cadre  of  well  trained\nprofessionals in the country is needed to introduce and develop new approaches to education and\ntraining on a self-sustaining basis. Sixty persons will participate in specially designed master level\nprograms, including five months on-campus training outside the country during holiday periods\nover two years and field activities carried out in-country during term time. Forty participants will be\nfrom the 8 TTCs (an average of 5 per TTC), 5 from TDC, 5 from DTT, 5 from DGE, and 5 from\nother Government agencies, including NRIES and NUOL. At least 30 percent of the trainees will\nbe women and 35 percent of the trainees will represent ethnic minorities. Content will include an\naction research focus and will be linked to actual work carried out in TTCs and classroom practice\nin schools. Consulting services will be provided to develop the course jointly with NUOL, TDC\nstaff, and TTC representatives. A total of 10 persons will be nominated from MOE and TTCs to\ntake a doctoral course outside the country.\n9. Professional Development for TTC Staff. Professional training will be given to all staff\nof the eight TTCs. A group of six staff from each TTC will be selected for training as trainers and\n                  \n3\nThe training in multigrade and Lao language will make use of materials and approaches developed under Loan\n1621-LAO: Basic Education (Girls) Project (BEGP), for $20 million, approved on 25 June 1998.", "49 Appendix 4, page 3\nwill receive 56 days training by consultants at the central level to prepare them to deliver training\nin their TTCs. One of the six from each TTC will be nominated as a counterpart for the\nconsultant and act as a leader of the group in each TTC. The trainers at each TTC working with\nthe consultants will organize training for 60 days during the second and the third years of the\nProject. This will include approximately 30 days training in the TTC and 30 days practical work\nmainly in the schools. The training will focus on developing more practical training approaches\nlinked to the new preservice and upgrading curriculum, which the staff of the TTC will be\ncharged with delivering. All the TTC staff (currently 365 persons) will take part in these activities.\nTeacher training consultants will be stationed for the second and the third years of the Project in\ntwo strategically situated TTCs: Louang Phrabang, and Pakse to assist with the training in the\nTTCs located in the north (Louang Namtha, Louang Phrabang, and Xieng Khouang) and south\n(Pakse, Saravane, and Savannakhet) of the country respectively, while the consultant stationed\nat MOE will assist the TTCs situated in Vientiane Province and Vientiane Municipality.\n10. Support for PAs. Secondary and primary school PAs are key persons to support and\nsupervise teachers at provincial and district levels in delivering classroom teaching and learning\nactivities. Duty statements laying out their role will be developed together with the PAs (during\ntraining), and discussions will take place with the Government to ensure the status of the PAs is\ninstitutionalized. Funding will be included in the Project for them to make regular school visits for\non-the-job training and monitoring. Motorcycles will be replaced where necessary, and operation\nand maintenance costs will be provided by the Government.\n11. Workshops for Master Trainers. Two teams of PA master trainers exist, whose duty it\nis to train primary and secondary school PAs. They include staff from DGE, TTCs, TUP, and\nPESs. There are 47 primary school master trainers (including 7 from DGE) and 42 secondary\nschool master trainers, including 6 from DGE). The Project will support seven-day annual\nworkshops at the national level for these master trainers to prepare for the PA training.\n12. Training of PAs to Support the Primary School District Level Programs. Although\nthe in-service training and upgrading activities to be developed under the Project will not be fully\nimplemented in all districts in the country within the project period, it is proposed to sustain and\ndevelop the existing PA training capacity in all districts. All 473 primary PAs, including those\nnewly appointed under the Basic Education (Girls) Project (footnote 2) (BEGP) will be trained\nannually for 12 days by the primary PA master trainers for the duration of the Project.\n13. Training of Lower Secondary In-Service Trainers (PAs and TTC staff). The PA\ntraining for secondary schools will also cover all provinces, although the delivery of training\nprograms supported by the Project will cover only 9 provinces. One hundred and forty-four\nsecondary PAs covering all 18 provinces will be trained as trainers for secondary teacher in-\nservice courses. They will be supplemented by 60 TTC staff (an average of 10 from each of the\n5 TTCs that have a secondary school program), as the number of secondary PAs will be\ninsufficient to carry out the in-service training program. Training of PAs and TTC trainers will be\n12 days each year.\n14. Training of Replacement PAs. Provision will be made for initial training of new and\nreplacement PAs. Four hundred and twenty new primary and 216 new secondary PAs will be\ntrained over six years, representing a replacement rate of approximately 15 percent and 25\npercent. The training costs have been high in the past, over $1,000 per person for primary PAs\nand over $1,300 for secondary PAs. A new curriculum will be developed, which considers the\nquality and cost-efficiency of PA training. Over 350 primary and 200 secondary replacement\nPAs are expected to be trained over the project period.\n15. Training of TUP Trainers. Provision has been made for the annual training of TUP\ntrainers to prepare them for upgrading unqualified primary school teachers; 108 trainers (6 from", "50 Appendix 4, page 4\neach of the 18 provinces) will be trained annually for 28 days by the national trainers provided\nby DTT. These trainers will support the whole TUP, which will be funded partly by this Project\nand partly by United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and be managed by a DTT unit.\nMotorcycles will be replaced where necessary, and operation and maintenance costs will be\nprovided by the Government.\n16. Training of Academic Teachers. Each primary school cluster is supported by a group\nof academic teachers. These are teachers of above average performance who are trained to\nlead activities for other teachers in the cluster. Approximately 700 academic teachers will be\ntrained as facilitators for primary in-service training conducted at the cluster level. The academic\nteachers will be trained for 10 days annually by primary PA master trainers.\nd. TTC Management\n17. Management Training for TTC Directors and Senior Staff. TTC management must be\nstrengthened to improve existing programs and to enable the introduction of new programs.\nManagement training of 24 days over two years will be provided at TDC for 32 senior TTC staff,\nwith follow-up on-the-job support at the TTCs from the consultants. This will focus on improving\nthe management (including resource mobilization for operation and maintenance) of teacher\ntraining facilities, equipment, and activities.\n18. Developing Continuing Education Models at the TTCs. A number of TTCs, notably\nthose in Louang Phrabang and Pakse, have started to diversify their activities by offering\ncourses for the community based on local demand. In the long term, the Government plan to\ndevelop certain TTCs into regional colleges. A study will be conducted during the first year of\nthe Project to review current continuing education models and their potential for expansion\n(para. 21). The Project will support the TTCs in developing pilot models of continuing education\nwhere there is demand.\n19. Pilot Project on Use of Distance Learning Strategies. Many new teachers who are\nnot fully qualified will likely be recruited to meet the needs of the expanding primary education\nsystem. A pilot project will be launched to reach out to the newly recruited teachers through\ndistance learning in a selected province with the TTC as the main coordinating institution. The\nexisting materials will be used with appropriate modification for this purpose.\ne. Study Visits to Neighboring Countries\n20. The Project will support study visits mainly for teachers, principals, and trainers (75\npercent of participants; of which at least 40 percent will be women) so that they can make\ncomparisons and learn lessons from other countries, and upgrading and training.\nf. Operational Studies\n21. A number of studies will take place to support the planning and implementation of the\nquality improvement program, including studies on (i) the performance of teachers with different\ntraining backgrounds (5+3, 8+3 etc.) as part of an assessment of their training needs; (ii) the\neffectiveness  of  existing  school  clusters,  their  patterns  of  activities  and  their  potential  for\nexpansion; (iii) TTC students to discover how many do not enter teaching and reasons for this;\n(iv) existing continuing education activities at the TTCs and the potential for expansion; and\n(v) student performance in language and mathematics to assess the impact of teacher training\nprograms, subject to agreement between Sida and MOE.", "51 Appendix 4, page 5\ng. Improving  Teacher  Incentives  (Including  Salaries)  and  Working\nConditions\n22. Teacher Policy Working Group. A teacher policy working group (TPWG), consisting of\nappropriate MOE personnel including staff of the Gender and Ethnic Minorities Education Unit\nand to be led by the Department of Personnel, will be established and staffed to the satisfaction\nof ADB within three months of loan effectiveness. The TPWG will make policy recommendations\nfor teacher incentives including salaries, teacher career development, duty statements, and\nrecommendations  to  improve  the  supply  of  teachers.  The  work  of  the  group  will  include\n(i) recommendations  for  revisions  to  salary  scales  to  link  them  more  realistically  and\nsystematically to years of experience, completion of training, and promotional opportunities;\n(ii) the development of duty statements for school principals, cluster heads, teacher trainers,\nacademic  teachers,  supervisors,  resource  center  managers,  and  teachers,  and  for  various\npositions within the TTCs; (iii) seeking agreement for revised transfer and promotion policies;\n(iv)  seeking  agreement  for  creating  an  equitable  system  of  teacher  deployment;  and\n(v) conducting studies to make policy recommendations on future teacher supply and demand\ntaking into account retirements, attrition rates, areas of high demand for teachers, population\ndata, and the current TTC quota system. The Government has agreed that an initial report and\nrecommendations will be produced within one year of the start of the Project. This will be\ndiscussed with all the concerned stakeholders including Sida and ADB, and a final report\nproduced within 18 months after the project start. The Government will then produce an action\nplan showing how it will implement the recommendations within two years after the start of the\nProject.\n2. Construction and Upgrading of Training Facilities\n23. TTC  Facilities  Upgrading.  The  TTC  facilities  remain  incomplete  or  have  serious\ndefects, which affects their usability. A survey report of the TTCs was undertaken under the\nproject preparatory technical assistance.4 Funding will be provided to upgrade TTC facilities and\nequipment in line with the recommendations of the report. This includes ensuring adequate\nwater supplies and sanitary arrangements, power supplies, rehabilitation of buildings in poor\ncondition, and some construction of additional dormitories and staff housing. It also includes\nfunds for instructional materials and books to stock the libraries.\n24. Secondary School PA Resource Centers and Network Teacher Upgrading Centers.\nEighteen PA resource centers have been built around the country to serve as a base for the\nprovincial secondary school PAs. The Project will provide packages of materials and equipment\nto 12 secondary school PA resource centers that have not yet received such packages and will\nsupport the use of the centers in the nine project provinces to strengthen their capacity to\neffectively support lower and upper secondary school teacher and principals. NTUCs also exist\nin each of 18 provinces. The Project will provide similar packages to the NTUCs in the nine\nproject provinces to support the TUP program.\n25. Resource Centers for School Clusters. Depending on the result of an operational\nstudy on the effectiveness of school clusters and the potential for expanding the number of\nclusters in the country, the Project will support the construction of up to 115 resource centers for\nschool clusters. It will train academic teachers in each cluster to support the activities taking\nplace in the resource centers.\n                  \n4\nManodham, Himmakone. 2001.

Delivery Provincial and District Teacher Training\na. Province Level Training\n26. Teacher  Upgrading  Programs  for  Unqualified  Primary  School  Teachers.  The\nProject will support the training of over 2,400 teachers under the TUP for unqualified primary\nschool  teachers.  The  expanded  programs  should  focus  on  districts  where  schools  or\nclassrooms are being built under the Project to ensure that the unqualified teachers appointed\nto these newly constructed schools and classrooms receive upgrading training as soon as\npossible. In the longer term, the TUP should also enable more coverage of remote and rural\nareas in other provinces. To increase the coverage in the future, the modules of the TUP will be\nelaborated and designed in a self-learning way to fit into a distance learning mode allowing the\nteachers to study on their own. The Project will support preparatory courses for underqualified\nupgrading trainees, which will be made available to a maximum of 240 (mainly underqualified\nfemale teachers) of the 1,200 teachers to be newly recruited under the Project. It will focus on\nsubjects that teachers need most help, such as mathematics and Lao language.\n27. Lower Secondary and Upper Secondary In-Service Training Programs. No system\nsuch as the primary school cluster system yet exists at the secondary education level. The\nProject will support the development of in-service activities for lower and upper secondary\nschools in cooperation with TTCs and the PA system, based initially at the provincial level, but\nwith the option to develop models based on the NTUC network. The Project will support in-\nservice training of 12 days per year during holiday time for teachers of core subjects at the\nprovincial level, starting form the third year of the Project. Patterns will be developed in each\nprovince in response to local circumstances. Training content will focus on specific subjects,\nand practical teaching approaches and materials. Initially, secondary PAs supplemented by TTC\nstaff will conduct training. Over 3,000 secondary school teachers from project provinces will\nparticipate in annual in-service training over four years.\n28. Secondary  School  Principal  Training.  Principals  of  approximately  500  lower  and\nupper secondary schools in project provinces will participate in 12 days of training annually. The\nfocus of training will be on school development and quality improvement including support for\nteacher training. Training will take place at the PESs or TTCs. Training will be conducted by a\nteam comprising MOE, the Faculty of Education of NUOL, and TTCs as appropriate.\nb. District Level Training\n29. School and Community Training at Cluster and District Levels. The Project will\nsupport  the  training  of  over  15,000  primary  school  teachers,  and  appropriate  numbers  of\nprimary school principals (approximately 2,500) and community members (approximately 7,500)\nin 70 districts at either district or cluster level. The training will take place annually and consist of\ntwo parts.\n30. Training for Developing School and Community Plans. School principals, teachers,\nand community members5 from all schools in the project districts will take part in three days\nannual training to develop school and community plans to increase the quality of teaching and\nlearning and increase participation in education in their schools, especially among girls and\nethnic minorities. This will include making plans for the use of school funds allocated to schools\nunder the Project to support school operation and maintenance, and promote learning and\nparticipation. It will also include planning for the use of matching grants allocated to schools by\ndistricts to carry out new school construction and rehabilitation.\n                  \n5\nThree community members will attend the training: the village head or representative, a woman\u2019s representative\nwho may be from the Lao Women\u2019s Union, and a parent selected by the community.", "53 Appendix 4, page 7\n31. Training for Improving the Quality of Teaching and Learning. All teachers and\nschool principals in project districts will take part in 12 days annual in-service training (including\nthe three days community training [para. 30]) focused on improving the quality of teaching and\nlearning in their schools. The teachers and principals will share practical ways of teaching and\nlearning,  interactive  methodologies,  multigrade  teaching,  and  basic  literacy.  Action  or\nparticipatory research on solving problems in schools will be adopted to address problems\nrelating to pupil retention, large classes, low literacy, and numeracy attainment. The training will\nsupport the development of school libraries, using the packages of books delivered by the\nProject. Where school clusters exist or can be developed, this training should take place using\nthe  existing  cluster  patterns  of  activities.  Where  cluster  activities  cannot  practically  be\nimplemented alternative arrangements for the training should be made. These arrangements\nshould be locally appropriate and may include training at the district level to take place during\nschool holidays. The training will be given by PAs and academic teachers, and in the future, a\nnationwide  in-service  teacher  training  network  to  be  based  on  the  NTUC  system  will  be\nintroduced in cooperation with TTCs, the PA system, and school clusters.\nB. Component 2: Increasing Access to and Participation in Education\n1. Expanding Access\n32. Models  for  School  Construction.  The  review  of  many  models  of  primary  school\nbuildings in the country showed that the availability of local materials and labor, contributions\nfrom the communities, and the accessibility to the road determine the model of school buildings.\nBased on the review, the Project proposes two options of flexible models for school construction\nand rehabilitization: (i) the medium standard of permanent building with a life span of more than\n25 years in the villages having an access road; and (ii) semipermanent building with three\ndifferent standards but having a life span of more than 25 years for the main structure. These\ntwo options are expected to be adapted by the Government, which will apply to this Project and\nthe World Bank\u2019s Second Education Development Program under preparation as a \u201cminimum\ncommon standard\u201d approach in the school construction program. Within six months of loan\neffectiveness, MOE will submit the prototype designs of project schools to ADB for review and\napproval, in line with the proposed \u201cminimum common standard\u201d approach.\n33. School Mapping and Data Collection. The project activities will be based on bottom-up\nplanning and a demand-driven approach. Districts involved in the Project will be required to\nundertake school mapping and data collection in the first year of each project phase, prior to\nany school construction and teacher training taking place. The mapping and data collection will\nprovide accurate data on school buildings, teachers, students, village populations, and the\nnature of community support to assess demand for education. The data will form the basis of\nplanning for school construction and quality improvement activities.6\n34. District Construction Plans. Districts will be allocated a budget to carry out a school\nconstruction program. This construction fund will initially be set at an average of $150,000 per\ndistrict to support the program expected to last up to three years. The size of the fund will not be\nuniform for each district, but will be weighted according to the following factors: (i) the total\nschool age population, (ii) the net enrollment rate in primary education, (iii) the number of\nincomplete  schools,  and  (iv)  the  number  of  villages  without  primary  schools.  This  will\nautomatically ensure the weighting of funding to the poor and ethnic minorities. The size of the\nfund for each district will be determined by MOE with assistance from the consultants and in\ncooperation with the PESs during the first year of project implementation, and submitted to ADB\nfor review and approval.\n                  \n6\nThe data to be collected and its format will be coordinated with data collection developed by other projects\nincluding  the  ADB-funded  BEGP,  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Second  Education  Development  Program  under\npreparation.", "54 Appendix 4, page 8\n35. Based on the data collected by the DEB, assisted by the provincial unit for construction\nand  development  assistance  (PUCDA)  and  advisory  support  provided  by  the  Education\nConstruction Service at MOE, the DEB will draw up a list of prioritized construction needs, and\ncosted programs for primary school construction in the district within the budget allocated.\nAccordingly,  the  district  construction  plans  include  the  following  activities  (i)  completing\nincomplete primary schools (At least 50 percent of the construction funds should be allocated to\ncompleting schools);7 (ii) building new primary schools; (iii) building additional classrooms for\nexisting complete primary schools; and (iv) rehabilitating schools.\n36. Over 1,000 new classrooms are expected to be built in the 41 project districts during the\nproject period. This will result in approximately 320 newly completed schools and 120 new\nmainly multigrade schools. In addition, approximately 1,400 classrooms will be rehabilitated with\nthe help of the construction funds, mainly by local communities.\n37. Construction activities will be carried out either by contractors or by local communities as\nfollows  (All  construction  activities  will  include  the  provision  of  furniture,  water  supply,  and\ntoilets):\n(i)  Building Permanent and Semipermanent Structures using Contractors. At\nleast  60  percent  of  the  construction  funds  (whether  for  rehabilitation,  or\nconstruction  of  new  schools  or  classrooms)  will  be  allocated  to  building\npermanent  or  semipermanent  structures  to  the  minimum  common  standard,\nwhich includes concrete floors, concrete or hardwood columns, plastered brick or\nwooden  walls,  and  fiber  cement  or  galvanized  iron  sheets.  The  buildings,  if\nproperly maintained, should have a life span of more than 25 years.\n(ii)  Matching Funds to Communities. The Project will encourage the use of at least\n20  percent  and  not  more  than  40  percent  of  the  construction  funds  being\nallocated  as  matching  funds  to  local  communities,  that  wish  to  rehabilitate,\ncomplete, or extend their schools. The funds may also be used to construct\nsimple daycare facilities to shelter younger siblings to enable girls to attend\nschool. As a general rule, materials such as roofing sheets and wood will be\ngiven to local communities to support their building activities. Funds can also be\nspent in poor villages to pay for labor costs or provide food for laborers.\n38. Quality Assurance. A qualified construction engineer will be appointed to each district\nto supervise all aspects of construction, assist the village with management of the construction\nprocess,  and  report  regularly  to  the  DEB  and  PUCDA  on  progress  and  any  problems\nencountered. Provincial project engineers will be posted in each of the four project provinces\nwhere school construction is to take place. They will be attached to the PUCDAs, and will\ncoordinate and supervise the work of the district construction engineers. MOE will ensure that\nenvironmental considerations, including ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines, are followed for all\nproject school construction and rehabilitation.\n39. Teachers for New Schools and Classrooms. Where possible the PES will provide\nteachers for additional schools and classrooms built under the Project from the resources\navailable. However, in many of the remote areas in which the Project will be operating, villages\nwill need to recruit unqualified school graduates as teachers. The Government has guaranteed\nto pay the salaries of these teachers, and they will be offered training under the TUP program.\nAfter  completing  the  training,  the  teachers  will  become  permanent  Government  teachers.\nTeachers  recruited  should  be  of  the  highest  level  of  education  available  in  the  village.\n                  \n7\nA complete school is one that caters for all primary school grades (1-5). Where there are small numbers of children\ntwo- or three-classroom multigrade schools will be constructed.", "55 Appendix 4, page 9\nAccordingly,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  at  least  one  trained  teacher,  or  in  some\nexceptional cases, untrained teacher, is appointed to each classroom to be constructed under\nthe Project at least three months prior to the physical completion of each school/classroom, and\nwill submit the name and qualification of each appointed to teacher to ADB within one month of\nappointment for ADB\u2019s review.\n2. Encouraging Participation in Education\n40. Provision of School Funds. The Project will establish the principle of Government\nprovision of school funds to encourage school-based management of resources. After the\nProject, such funds will become the norm for all schools. The school funds will supplement, and\nnot replace, the community funding already provided in schools. The Project will provide an\nannual budget averaging approximately KN1,040,000 (currently $130) to schools in districts\ntaking part in the Project as the Government counterpart fund. The actual amount for each\nschool will be determined by existing Government regulations that allocate school budgets\naccording to the size of schools. The school funds, which must not be used to supplement\nteachers\u2019 pay, will be used for (i) support for school operation and maintenance including\npurchase  of  books,  teaching  materials,  and  equipment,  and  minor  maintenance  of  school\nbuildings,  furniture,  equipment,  and  blackboards;  and  (ii)  special  programs  to  encourage\nlearning and participation in education (focusing on small-scale programs by schools and local\ncommunities  to  increase  enrollment  and  improve  student  performance.  Approximately  50\npercent of the school funds will be used for programs that include such activities as organizing\nextra  classes  to  support  basic  literacy,  running  classes  for  parents  and  the  community,\nemploying  community  assistants  to  support  teachers.  Proposals  for  such  programs  must\nindicate measurable improvements in learning, repetition rates or school attendance, by which\nthe success of the initiative can be monitored. The Project will support an operational study on\nthe effectiveness of special school and community level programs in reducing dropout and\nrepetition, and improving learning in schools.\n41. Release of the school funds to schools will be dependent on schools making a school\nplan that will show how the funds will be used. The school plan will be drawn up as part of the\nannual school and community training, and will have to be approved by the DEB. The training\nwill enable communities to monitor the use of these funds. Schools will have to report on the\nuse of the previous year\u2019s funds before the release of the next year\u2019s funds is approved. This\nfunding scheme will be reviewed in the midterm review and the number of funds may be\nincreased if the scheme is judged successful.\n42. Provision of a Package of Library Books, Maps, and Posters to Schools. A small\ncollection of library books and a collection of instructional posters on Lao language for primary\nschools have been produced by NRIES with assistance from UNICEF. A small selection of other\nbooks for primary schools is also available from other funding sources. The Project will provide\neach  school  in  the  project  districts  with  a  package  of  books,  maps,  and  posters  worth\nKN1,000,000  (currently  $125)  to  enable  them  to  start  a  small  library.  Training  in  the\nmanagement and use of these resources will be included in teacher training programs.\n43. Lao Women\u2019s Union Training of Trainers. The Project will support and strengthen the\ndistrict and village level of Lao Women\u2019s Union (LWU) and education initiatives. The social\ndevelopment specialist and social development coordinators will work with LWU at national and\nprovincial level to develop a program to support education initiatives in the project districts. An\norientation program will be provided for provincial LWU staff in the north and south. The social\ncoordinators will work with LWU national trainers to train LWU district coordinators as trainers at\nthe village level. The district LWU trainers will receive a four-day training program consisting of\ntwo sessions of two days at an interval of 18 months. Topics to be covered include encouraging", "56 Appendix 4, page 10\ngirls  to  stay  in  school,  supporting  mothers  in  learning  about  the  value  of  education,  and\npromoting nutrition for school children.\nC. Component 3: Strengthening Management Capacity and Project Implementation\n44. The Project will support the long-term capacity building of management structures at\neach level of the education services under the decentralized education system. The Project will\nbuild up planning and management capacity at MOE to support the teacher training system and\nteacher development, and develop management capacity at PES, DEB, and village levels to\nsupport planning and implementation of school construction, school support and teacher training\nprograms.\n1. Strengthening Capacity of MOE\n45. Consultants will provide technical assistance in planning and policy development to DTT,\nDGE, other MOE departments, and NRIES staff engaged in teacher training to develop strategic\nplans.  Support  will  also  be  provided  to  the  TPWG  led  by  the  Department  of  Personnel.\nConsulting services will be provided to DTT and DGE, Department of Planning and International\nCooperation and Department of Finance in managing the teacher training and development,\nconstruction, and other project programs. The consultants will provide advice and training in\ntechnical matters related to the Project and will provide assistance and training in planning,\nbudgeting and accounting, implementation, monitoring and supervising, and reporting. Two\nqualified project assistants will be provided to strengthen the project implementation unit in\nproject  planning,  budgeting  and  accounting,  monitoring  and  supervising,  and  reporting.\nWorkshops  to  support  project  management  and  implementation  will  be  supported  by  the\nProject. Operational budgets and equipment will be provided to support their daily tasks, and to\nmonitor and supervise activities in the field.\n2. Strengthening Capacity of the PES and DEB\n46. The Project will provide consulting services to review the structure of the PES and make\nrecommendations for changes in structure to support its expanded role under the Project, which\nwill  in  turn  prepare  it  for  decentralization.  Institutional  development  and  management\nconsultants and MOE staff will provide training in school mapping and data collection for school\nconstruction,  and  planning,  budgeting  and  accounting,  implementing,  monitoring  and\nsupervising, and reporting teacher training programs. One qualified assistant will be provided to\neach of six PESs. One additional qualified assistant will be appointed to each of four PUCDAs in\nproject provinces to help plan and supervise construction. A national project engineer stationed\nat  MOE  will  give  advice  and  training  to  each  PUCDA  in  managing  and  monitoring  the\nconstruction program. The Project will support PUCDA staff for their site visits to plan and\nsupervise construction. Operational budgets and equipment will be provided to each PES and\nPUCDA. This will include computers and printers for PES and PUCDA.\n47. New DEB offices will be built in up to 55 out of the 61 project districts that do not\ncurrently have permanent offices. These will be permanent structures (medium standard) with\nthe life span of more than 25 years and a floor area of approximately 220 square meters, similar\nto the design used in the ADB-funded BEGP. Furniture and equipment will be provided. The\nDEB staff will be given intensive training in school mapping and data collection, planning and\nbudgeting  teacher  training  programs  and  school  funds,  and  substantial  assistance  in\nimplementing  the  these  activities.  The  qualified  assistants  assigned  to  PESs  will  spend  a\nconsiderable part of their time working at the DEB level to assist with these activities Computers\nand printers will be provided on an experimental basis to DEBs that have a power supply. The\nability of the DEBs to make use of these computers will be reviewed periodically.", "PROJECT COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\nTable A5.1: Financing Plan with Percentage Breakdown\n($'000)\nTotal Cost ADB Financed Sida Financed Government Financed\nForeign Local Total  Foreign Local Total  Foreign Local Total  Foreign Local Total \nActivity Exchange Currency Cost Exchange Currency Cost Exchange Currency Cost Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

Introduction\n1. Quality  and  quantity  of  education  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  vary\nsignificantly. The education status of lowland ethnic groups has been higher than that of other\nethnic groups, and boys have received significantly more education than girls. The problems of\nequal access to the education system by girls and ethnic minorities are closely related; among\nethnic minorities, the gender gap is significantly greater than for the lowland Lao-speaking\npopulation. Any strategy seeking to address the low enrollment of girls will also have to focus on\nethnic  minority  issues  and  any  strategy  focusing  on  the  low  enrollment  of  ethnic  minority\nchildren will also have to focus on gender concerns. The Project is committed to support an\nincrease in access to education for both of these groups. The Project\u2019s Gender and Ethnic\nMinority  Strategy  (GEMS)  has  been  prepared  in  consultation  with  the  gender  and  ethnic\nminorities education unit (GEMEU) in the Department of General Education (DGE), the Lao\nFront for National Construction, and the Lao Women\u2019s Union (LWU).\nB. Project Gender and Ethnic Minority Strategy\n2. Building upon the ongoing initiatives carried out in the Asian Development Bank-funded\nBasic Education (Girls) Project (BGEP),1 the Project\u2019s GEMS has the following basic principles:\n(i)  where  possible,  prioritize  resource  allocation  to  geographically  targeted  remote  ethnic\nminority areas where gender disparities tend to be larger; (ii) promote participation of ethnic\nminorities and women in project activities throughout the project cycle; (iii) promote gender-\nsensitive  and  ethnic  minority  curriculum,  materials,  and  policy  and  strategy  development;\n(iv) address special needs and constraints of ethnic minorities and female students, teachers,\ngovernment officials, and project staff; and (v) strengthen capacity of relevant institutions that\naddress ethnic and gender concerns and equality.\n3. Specific activities and approaches for each project components are explained in Table\nA9:\nTable A9: Components and Targets for the Gender and Ethnic Minority Strategy\nComponent/Activity Approach and Target\nComponent 1 (Quality)\nTeacher education strategy Technical  assistance  provided  by  the  Project  will  ensure  that  the\ndevelopment priorities and operational plans address gender and ethnic equity and\nspecial needs, such as quota for female teacher training.\nTraining materials and Adequate  representation  and  participation  of  women  and  ethnic\ncurricula development minorities will be ensured in the curriculum and materials development\nteam formed under the Project, and as respondents and discussants of\nteacher training needs.\nIn reviewing and revising various current curricula, assessment and\nrecommendations will be made to address the needs of female and\nethnic  minority  teachers  (including  future  teachers).  Gender  and\nethnicity-sensitive  teacher  training  curriculum  and  materials  will  be\ndeveloped.\n                  \n1 Loan 1621-LAO: Basic Education (Girls) Project, for $20.0 million, approved on 25 June 1998.", "70 Appendix 9, page 2\nComponent/Activity Approach and Target\nCurriculum development for distance education for in-service training\nwill especially benefit teachers in remote ethnic minority areas and\nfemale teachers whose mobility is limited.\nTraining of trainers Where  additional  pedagogical  advisers  are  required  (initially  as\nreplacements  for  existing  pedagogical  adviser),  female  and  ethnic\nminority candidates will be given priority.\nImprovement of teacher Separate focus group discussions by gender and ethnic groups will be\nsalaries, incentives, and held so that their special concerns and constraints will be addressed,\nworking conditions such as women\u2019s need for child care facilities and difficulty of ethnic\nminority teachers in being assigned away from home.\nEfforts will be made to increase awareness of female teachers\u2019 rights,\nand benefits issues will be raised, including maternity leave benefits.\nAffirmative  actions  in  the  promotion  policy  for  women  and  ethnic\nminorities  will  be  considered  by  the  teacher  policy  working  group,\nwhich will review the current conditions and policies.\nConstruction and upgrading Construction  will  be  done  in  consultation  with  potential  users  of\nof teacher training facilities facilities to ensure that concerns are taken into account. Separate toilet\nfacilities for female teachers will be included and other concerns can\nbe taken into account (provision for day care, location of facilities, etc.).\nDelivery of in-service teacher In-service training will be made available to teachers in the 70 districts\ntraining at a local level in nine provinces, most with a large ethnic minority population. Training\nof unqualified teachers locally will especially benefit ethnic minority and\nfemale  teachers,  as  many  are  unqualified  and  they  have  mobility\nconstraints.\nComponent 2 (Access and Participation)\nConstruction of primary The component will cover four provinces, three of which have large\nschools, rehabilitation, and ethnic minority  populations  and  large  gender  disparities  in  primary\ncompletion of incomplete enrolment.\nschools\nTo accommodate the needs of shifting communities while achieving\noverall sustainability of building, the percentage of permanent versus\nsemipermanent buildings in each district will be decided according to\nthe local situation.\nWithin a province, the Project\u2019s budget allocation among districts will\nbe based upon the selection criteria prioritizing underserved districts,\nwhich will benefit remote ethnic minority areas with lowest female\nattendance. Within a district, budget allocation will also be based on\ndistrict mapping, which will target the underserved areas in a district.\nUpgrading of incomplete schools to complete schools with additional\nteachers will also solve the isolation problems typically felt by female\nteachers at incomplete schools.\nRecruitment of new school About 1,200 new teachers will be recruited locally, of which at least 50\nteachers for the new percent will be women. Local recruitment will make the life of female\nclassrooms and ethnic minority teachers easier, as they will not have to relocate.", "71 Appendix 9, page 3\nComponent/Activity Approach and Target\nProvision of community Local communities will be provided with grants matched by community\nmatching grants contribution in kind and/or labor. Based on the demand, the community\nmay rehabilitate, complete, or extend their schools. The funds may\nalso be used to construct simple day-care facilities attached to primary\nschools to encourage ethnic minority girls to attend school.\nProvision of funds to schools The funds may be used for purchasing books, teaching materials, and\nblackboards, and supporting special programs. Such programs may\ninclude  extra  reading  classes  for  children  and  illiterate  adults\n(especially women); recruitment of pre-school assistants (most likely\nwomen) who will take care of preschool children at day-care centers ;\nrecruitment of paid community teaching assistants (most likely women)\nwho will assist especially grade 1 teachers who have to take care of\novercrowded classrooms. Many of these will specifically benefit women\nand girls, especially those of ethnic minority groups, and allow them to\nconcentrate better on education.\nCommunity and school staff A  committee  for  community  education  development  (CCED)  or\ntraining for annual planning equivalent, comprising the school principal, teacher representatives,\nand monitoring of the use of village head and representatives, LWU or women representatives, and\ngrants parents will be trained annually to prepare a school plan that will\ndetermine  how  school  funds  will  be  used.  LWU  and  women\nrepresentatives will be trained by district LWU staff to ensure that\nschool funds will prioritize activities specifically benefiting women and\ngirls. CCED will also be trained on participatory monitoring of the use\nof funds. This approach will better ensure that local specific gender\nneeds are addressed and that differences among ethnic minorities are\ntaken into account in education activities.\nTraining of trainers for the Awareness raising on the importance of girls education and school\ndistrict LWU staff who will nutrition will be carried out in the community. This will especially benefit\ntrain communities ethnic minority girls. District LWU trainers will carry out training to\nCCEDs.\nComponent 3 (Management Capacity Building)\nStrengthen the capacity of all GEMEU  will  provide  technical  advice  to  implement  the  Project\u2019s\nimplementing agencies GEMS. They will be also allocated with a small budget to carry out\ninvolved (central, provincial, necessary studies and awareness raising for relevant MOE and other\ndistrict, and village levels) staff, and monitoring the implementation of the GEMS. The Project\u2019s\nand strengthen the social development specialist and social development coordinators will\ncoordination with GEMEU at also assist provincial and district staff in implementing the GEMS. The\nthe Ministry of Education Project  will  provide  funding  for  one  incremental  staff  to  work  with\n(MOE) headquarters GEMEU.\nMonitoring and evaluation All  the  performance  and  impact  monitoring  indicators  will  be\ndisaggregated  by  gender  and  ethnicity  wherever  possible.  The\nProject\u2019s capacity building assistance will make sure that appropriate\nindicators will be developed and followed through.\nC. Implementation Strategy\n4. Organization. GEMEU at MOE\u2019s DGE will have overall responsibility for monitoring and\nsupervising the implementation of the project GEMS and provide technical advice. GEMEU will", "72 Appendix 9, page 4\nbe a member of the MOE steering Committee. The Lao Front for National Construction and the\nEthnic  Minority  Education  Division  in  DGE  will  also  be  consulted  as  necessary.  Specific\nimplementation responsibilities will lie with the project implementation unit (PIU) at the central\nlevel, provincial PIUs (PPIUs), and district PIUs (DPIUs). LWU will be also consulted and will\nparticipate as a local facilitating group. Nongovernment organizations will be consulted for\ndeveloping more innovative approaches to reach ethnic minority students in remote areas\nduring the implementation.\n5. Institutional Capacity. In MOE, only DGE and Department of Nonformal Education\nhave significant, direct experience in dealing with ethnic minority education. GEMEU in DGE\ngained  significant  experience  through  the  ongoing  BEGP.  Therefore,  GEMEU  will  provide\nawareness raising on both gender and ethnic minority issues to the central PIU, curriculum and\nmaterials development team, teacher policy working group, and other relevant project staff at\nthe central level. Provinces and districts also have experience in promoting ethnic and gender\nequity and addressing special needs and aspirations of female and ethnic minority students and\nteachers. The social development specialist and social development coordinators will build upon\nongoing training and awareness raising for provinces and districts carried out under the BEGP,\nassisted by GEMEU. One or more staff members from GEMEU will be invited to participate in\nthe long-term capacity building proposed in this Project, including postgraduate training.\n6. Budget and Financing Plan. The GEMS does not require a separate budget because it\nis fully integrated into the overall project budget. The benefits of component 1 will spread\nnationwide at different levels; estimating how much will accrue to ethnic minorities is difficult.\nApproximately 60 percent of the component 2 civil works in the four provinces (approximately\n$3.7 million) will directly result in increasing access in remote and ethnic minority areas. The\nProject  will  also  have  various  specialist  assistance  through  component  3;  among  others,\ninstitutional  development  and  management  adviser  and  team  leader  (42  person-months,\ninternational), curriculum and teacher training consultants (24 person-months each for two\npersons, international), social development specialist (39 person-months, domestic), and social\ndevelopment coordinators (51 person-months each for two persons, domestic) will especially be\ninvolved to help the implement the GEMS. GEMEU will be provided with incremental budget\nand one incremental staff under component 3.\n7. Implementation Schedule. The schedule of GEMS implementation will be in line with\noverall project implementation. A four-phased approach will be taken for the delivery of the\nteacher training subcomponent in component 1 and a three-phased approach for component 2.\nEach phase will last for three years.\n8. Monitoring and Evaluation. GEMEU will be responsible for overall monitoring and\nevaluation  of  GEMS  implementation,  combined  by  participatory  benefit  monitoring  and\nevaluation by ethnic minority beneficiaries themselves in the communities. For the building\nteacher training system and teacher development capacity subcomponent under component 1,\nthe PIU will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of GEMS in such areas as teacher\neducation strategy development, curriculum and materials development, and teacher incentives\nimprovement. The PIU will be also responsible for monitoring provincial implementation of the\nGEMS, while PPIUs will be responsible for monitoring district level implementation. DPIUs will\nmonitor community and school-based implementation of GEMS. A GEMEU staff will participate\nin the midterm review.", "73 Appendix 10, page 1\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS\nA.  Economic Rationale\n1. At the moment, only 40 percent of Lao citizens who are entering the workforce for the\nfirst time have completed primary education: one third of those have never entered school and\nthe others dropped out before successful completion. In these circumstances, efficient programs\nthat significantly increase the number of children who enter and successfully complete primary\nschool are one of the most cost-effective investments for socioeconomic development. The\nProject has been formulated within the overall objective to provide universal quality primary\neducation. It also proposes limited interventions to improve the quality of secondary education,\nwhich should feed back into improvements in primary education by providing better recruits for\nteaching. The Project will also serve an equity objective by contributing to the extension of\naccess to primary education in selected underserved areas, in line with the overarching goal of\nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) to reducing poverty.\nB. Labor Market and Social Needs\n2. Assuming that government employment follows population growth (at 2.4 percent per\nannum), an additional 2,600 government jobs will be created each year. For nongovernment\njobs, if economic growth follows the precrisis trend (e.g., 5.2 percent per annum for industrial\nsector growth and 12.2 percent per annum for service sector growth), as many as 7,000 new\njobs would be created each year in the private sector or state enterprise firms. Those who do\nnot find work in the formal sector will be absorbed into the family subsistence economy: some\ncombination of agriculture, household businesses, and the informal sector. The size of these\nlabor market entrants will be at least 110,400.1 Women are underrepresented in the formal\nsector and overrepresented in the informal sector. This labor pattern continues to have an\nimpact on girls who drop out at higher rates to support family farming and household activities.\nCurrent student flows out of the education system do not meet the needs of the nongovernment\nlabor market and those who work there. A particular problem is that most of those who will be\nabsorbed into the family subsistence economy\u2014about 70,000 persons each year\u2014will not have\ncompleted primary education. They will be largely illiterate and with little or no numeracy, greatly\nlimiting their opportunities to make a decent living. These individuals will not fully share in or\ncontribute to the development that is going to occur.\n3. A lack of education also seriously limits the advancement of women and seriously limits\nfamily planning, child care, and basic health care in the family. High illiteracy rates among\nwomen are a significant influence on the country\u2019s poor record in social indicators, especially\nthe high rates of maternal mortality for children under five. The first steps to meet the needs for\nthis vast majority of people is literacy and numeracy\u2014that is, completing primary education.\nC. Beneficiaries\n4. Activities under component 2 will operate in remote and poor areas in the selected 41\ndistricts. The emphasis will be on upgrading the incomplete schools to complete schools with all\nprimary school grades (1-5), as a high dropout occurs in early grades. The Project will greatly\nincrease  the  opportunity  for  children  in  these  districts  to  receive  a  full  five-year  primary\neducation  by  building  approximately  45  classrooms  in  each  district  and  by  completing\nincomplete schools. This will amount to a new supply of about 1,000 classrooms in total. Using\nthe average primary level pupil-teacher ratio of 30:1, this means that about 30,000 students per\n                  \n1  ADB. 2000. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Education Sector Development Plan Report. Manila.", "74 Appendix 10, page 2\nyear are expected to complete primary education in the project-assisted newly constructed or\nnewly  completed  primary  schools.  The  Project  will  also  ensure  that  more  of  them  finish\nreasonable quality primary education than now by assigning new teachers who will be also\ntrained through the Project. Based on the total number of primary school students in the\nprovinces that will receive either full access and quality programs (Bokeo, Louang Namtha,\nSavanakhet, and Sayaburi) or full quality program (Champassak and Vientiane) under the\nProject, more than 400,000 primary level students are expected benefit from the higher quality\nof instructions by the end of the Project.\n5. Under  component  1,  many  teachers  will  benefit  from  new  and  improved  training\nprograms. This will include over 2,000 graduates annually from the teacher training colleges\n(TTCs); 2,400 unqualified teachers who will be trained and better qualified; and approximately\n15,000  primary  school  teachers,  2,500  primary  school  principals,  3,000  secondary  school\nteachers, and 500 secondary school principals who will have taken part in regular and repeated\nin-service training. This amounts to 55 percent of primary school teachers and 30 percent of\nsecondary school teachers in the country. To provide intensive training inputs, 365 TTC trainers,\n108 teacher upgrading program (TUP) trainers, 473 primary school pedogogical advisers (PAs)\nand 144 secondary school PAs will be trained on a regular and repeated basis.\nD. Cost-Effectiveness and Internal Efficiency\n6. A key element for cost-effectiveness of education spending is per student cost. Table\nA10 shows the annual recurrent cost per student by education level and expenditure category.\nFrom this table, two facts are obvious. First, primary education is by far the least expensive\nspending per student. Second, the share of teacher salaries makes up the largest share at\nprimary education level. This indicates that improvement in teacher quality at primary level\nwould be the single most important and most cost-effective educational spending, which will\nbetter prepare students for higher level education. Therefore, it makes good economic sense\nthat various activities planned under the Project aim to improve quality and access mainly of\nprimary education.\nTable A10: Unit Recurrent Cost by Expenditure Type and By Schooling Level (1996-97)\n(KN per student per year)\nExpenditure Type Pre- Primary Lower Upper Techical/ Teacher Higher\nSchool Secondary Secondary Vocational Training Education\nGeneral Administration 4,295 1,351 4,424 5,298 8,127 7,651 5,928\n    % share in total exp 9.0 5.7 9.6 9.6 3.2 3.2 3.3\nOperation and Maintenance 2,785 1,532 2,883 3,455 35,398 30,273 23,042\n    % share in total exp 5.8 6.5 6.2 6.2 14.0 12.8 12.6\nScholarships 81,542 62,541 41,994\n    % share in total exp 32.3 26.4 23.0\nNonteaching Staff 7,967 916 1,196 1,801 33,818 38,922 40,908\n    % share in total exp 16.7 3.9 2.6 3.3 13.4 16.4 22.4\nStudent/Nonteacher Ratio 83 262 90 104 13 12 17\nTeachers 32,752 19,725 37,627 44,728 93,552 97,804 70,379\n    % share in total exp 68.5 83.9 81.6 80.9 37.1 41.2 38.6\nStudent/Teacher Ratio 18 30 15 16 7 6 6\nAverage Class Size 28 28 35 40 22\nTotal 47,799 23,524 46,130 55,282 252,437 237,191 182,251\nSource: Bouapao, L., O.

Educational Financing and Budgeting in Lao  PDR,\nInternational Institute for Educational Planning: Paris. pp. 133-34, tables F and G.", "75 Appendix 10, page 3\n7.  A rough estimate of annualized capital (building and facilities with assumed 30-year life)\ncost per student in primary education was about $20 in 1996/97. This is about KN20,000 at\n(KN1,000 per dollar in that year).  This is about equal or slightly less than the recurrent cost per\nstudent in primary education. In comparable countries, the ratio of capital to recurrent cost is 25-\n30:70-75 percent (footnote 1, 186). This means that the relative cost of using these schools is\nabout four times larger than what is observed in comparable countries. While the country\u2019s\nunfavorable  topography  partly  explains  this  comparison,  the  message  is  that  building  new\nprimary schools will not be cost-effective as a reasonable level of recurrent spending cannot be\nmatched against them. This fact has led to the Project\u2019s priority of teacher quality improvement\n(Component  1)  and  completing  schools  with  less  than  five  grades  (component  2),  while\ncomponent 3 is aimed at strengthening institutional capacity to improve efficiency of education\nsystem under the country\u2019s new decentralization mandate.\nE. External Efficiency\n8. Some of the primary school graduates in project districts will go on to higher levels of\neducation  but  most  will  leave  school  after  completing  primary  school  and  eventually  be\nabsorbed  into  the  family  subsistence  economy.  The  record  in  other  countries  shows  that\ncompared with those who have little or no education, farmers with a primary education are more\nproductive. Once educated, their career aspirations may improve, and the receptiveness to new\nideas, information, and technology will increase. Completion of basic education will not only\nmean that such individuals will share in the country\u2019s economic growth, but also contribute to\nthat  growth  through  rising  productivity  in  the  long  run.  In  addition,  basic  education  is  a\nnecessary input to various government goals; e.g., for rural populations to change practices\nsuch as slash-and-burn and consuming a dwindling supply of wildlife, and to promote successful\nhealth programs. Basic education is critical if people are to adopt preventive, primary health\ncare measures. Without basic education, people may not appreciate the potential net benefits of\nimmunization or mosquito control. However, as in other basic education projects, no attempt\nhas been made to quantify these external efficiency effects attributable to the Project.\nF. Poverty Impact\n9. As of this writing, the Government of the Lao PDR has not yet decided on an official\npoverty line. Two alternative lines developed by the World Bank and the Swedish Statistics\nOffice  give  conflicting  information  poverty  incidence.  The  latest  ADB  study  attempted  a\ncalculation  of  a  poverty  line  that  is  consistent  between  the  1992/93  Lao  Expenditure  and\nConsumption Survey and the 1997/98 update, based on which the average total poverty line for\nthe Lao PDR is estimated to be KN19,184 per person per month in 1997/98 prices.2 The\nfollowing analysis is based on this poverty line.\n10. As the Project will serve currently underserved areas, it is expected to make a significant\ncontribution to intergenerational income improvements and poverty reduction among families in\nthe target districts. This estimate is based on certain assumptions on prioritized outreach of\nteacher training and school completions associated with the project design and focus that lead\nto the Project having a higher poverty impact (on a head-count basis) than the national poverty\nincidence level of 38.6 percent (footnote 2). While the whole country can be considered poor,\nthe Project is envisaged to disproportionately benefit those living below the poverty line.\n                  \n2 Kakwani, Nanak, Bounthavy Siouphanhthong, Phonesaly Souksavath and Brent Dark. 2001.
