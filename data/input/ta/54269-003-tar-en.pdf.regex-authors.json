THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) will provide critical policy advisory, \nlegal and analytical support, and capacity building for the government to pursue the restructuring \nof the power sector aimed at enabling competition and creating a conducive environment for \nprivate investment. The TA will (i) improve regulatory and legislative framework to deepen the \npower sector reform and expand private sector participation, and (ii) develop a distribution sector \ndevelopment strategy and master plan to identify priority investment pipelines for potential public \nand private sector investments.   \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a programmatic approach and policy-\nbased loan (PBL) for the Power Sector Reform Program comprising two subprograms to help the \ngovernment in designing and implementing policy actions and legislative reforms to address \nspecific development constraints.1 A regular loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources and collaborative cofinancing through a loan of \u20ac150 million from Agence Francaise de \nDeveloppement (AFD) was provided to the Government of Uzbekistan to finance subprogram 1 \nin 2020. The TA will support the implementation of policy actions in preparation of subprogram 2. \nThe approval of the ensuing subprogram 2 is targeted in 2023, with an indicative loan amount of \n$300 million.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  As  one  of  the  fastest-growing  economies  in  Central  and  West  Asia,  Uzbekistan \nexperienced robust economic growth averaging more than 7.0% in the first part of the 2010s. \nHowever, since 2015, unfavorable external environment conditions, such as declining commodity \nprices and subdued growth of trading partner countries, slowed economic growth from 6.1% in \n2016 to 4.5% in 2017. In response, the country initiated comprehensive economic reforms in 2017 \nto stimulate demand, foster foreign investment, and develop the private sector. Uzbekistan has \nmade good progress on economic reforms while entrenching macroeconomic stability. Major \nstructural reforms to date include implementing foreign exchange and tax reforms, improving \nmacro fiscal management, and restructuring state-owned enterprises. Backed by the gains of the \nstructural reforms, Uzbekistan was one of the few countries in the region to record an economic \nexpansion in 2020 despite the pandemic; an economic rebound is expected from 2021 onward.2  \n \n4.  Reliable and affordable electricity supply is fundamental for driving economic growth and \nsocioeconomic  development.  Removing  infrastructure  bottlenecks  has  become  even  more \nimportant for creating jobs and increasing labor productivity during the country\u2019s recovery period \nfrom the pandemic. Uzbekistan\u2019s power sector is characterized by (i) inadequate infrastructure to \nmeet the fast-growing demand; (ii) aging, unreliable, and rather inefficient system; (iii) limited \ndiversification of energy resources and high reliance on fossil fuel; and (iv) weak financial \nsustainability and limited access to capital. The government forecasts electricity demand to \ndouble by 2030, and $26 billion is required to add 17 gigawatts of generation capacity and more \n \n1  ADB. 2020.

The  government  has  a  strong  reform  agenda,  with  the  overarching  objectives  of \nrestructuring the power sector to enable competition and creating a conducive environment for \nprivate investment.4 In developing the reform program, the government undertook high-level \npolicy  dialogues  with  the  development  partners  including  ADB,  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD),  and  the  World  Bank.  Building  on  ADB\u2019s  strong \npresence in the sector and policy dialogue built under the macroeconomic reform policy-based \nlending operations,5 ADB provided a programmatic approach PBL for the Power Sector Reform \nProgram (footnote 1). The program has four reform pillars: (i) power sector restructuring and \ndevelopment of regulatory capacity, (ii) improved sector financial sustainability, (iii) reduction in \ncarbon intensity of power generation, and (iv) increased demand-side energy efficiency. Key \nachievements and progress toward subprogram 2 are presented in paras. 6\u201311.  \n \n6.  Reform pillar 1: Power sector restructured and regulation strengthened. In March \n2019, the government embarked on comprehensive reforms\u2014starting from the creation of the \nMinistry of Energy as the sector\u2019s governing ministry and liberalizing the market structure\u2014to \nfacilitate competition and attract private investment to the power sector. The power sector has \nbeen unbundled into the generation, transmission, and distribution sector entities. The state-\nowned transmission company, the National Electric Grids of Uzbekistan (NEGU), now functions \nas the transmission system operator and the electricity off-taker from all generators under a \nsingle-buyer market model. The multiple privately financed power projects, including the first \nprivate sector solar project financed by ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations, made successful debut \nin Uzbekistan and now competes to provide reliable and affordable electricity.6  \n \n7.  Reform pillar 2: Sector financial sustainability improved. The government created an \ninterministerial tariff commission under the Cabinet of Ministers by separating the function from \nthe Ministry of Finance to strengthen the independence and transparency of tariff determination. \nTo improve collection rates and establish commercial disciplines, the government is rolling out \nthe smart metering program throughout the country. The government has implemented a program \nof measures to attract private power producers, including a credit enhancement mechanism, to \nmitigate NEGU\u2019s credit risks and development of bankable transaction structures and contract \ntemplates. ADB was mandated by the government to identify and develop 1,000-megawatt (MW) \nsolar public\u2013private partnership (PPP) program. Under this program, the private partner for the \nfirst project, 457 MW Sherabad solar power project, was successfully selected at a record-\nbreaking tariff. Similar activities are ongoing with the assistance of the EBRD and the World Bank \nGroup. Currently, private partners for a total of 1,000 MW solar and 500 MW wind PPP projects \nhave been selected.  \n \n8.  Reform pillar 3: Power sector carbon intensity reduced. The government adopted a \nlong-term power sector development strategy (footnote 4) to (i) develop solar and wind energy \n \n3  Government of Uzbekistan, Ministry of Energy. 2020.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nsources to cover more than 15% of electricity generation by 2030, (ii) retire old and inefficient \n5,900 MW thermal power plants, and (iii) increase energy trade with neighboring countries. \nUzbekistan renewed its pledge to reach carbon neutrality in the power sector by 2050 and \ngraduate from fossil fuel power generation. In terms of transmission and distribution, policy \nactions focused on reducing losses and expanding the grid system to accommodate increasing \nrenewable energy integration. To strengthen the grid system and digitalize the system operation, \nNEGU  is  developing  a  10-year  grid  system master  plan  with World  Bank\u2019s  assistance. In \ndistribution, ADB is providing a TA to prepare a regulatory framework to promote the small-scale \ndistributed renewable energy generation.7   \n \n9.  Reform pillar 4: Demand-side energy efficiency increased. The government approved \nan energy efficiency road map, focusing on upgrading regulatory standards to international \nstandards,  and  setting  energy-saving  targets  for  high-energy-consuming  enterprises.  The \ngovernment also adopted a district heating efficiency improvement program for 2019\u20132022, \nfocusing on Tashkent City, representing 70% of the country\u2019s district heating demand. With ADB \nassistance, the government is in the process of selecting a private partner who will modernize \nand operate the district heating system under PPP modality. The introduction of an energy \nconservation data management system to trace energy consumption by sector is planned. The \ngovernment is planning to develop a new energy-labeling standard. \n \n10.  Under reform pillars 1 and 2, the government intends to amend the Electricity Law (2009) \nto ensure commercial principles governing the sector, attract private investment, and create \nconditions for further liberalization of the electricity market. The most critical next step is the \ncreation  of  the  independent  energy  regulator  responsible  for  the  key  functions  of  tariff \ndetermination,  licensing,  market  regulation,  and  consumer  protection.  The  regulator\u2019s \nindependence will preserve stability and continuity in rule setting and avoid political interference \nin business decisions and regulatory risks. Being a complex process requiring the preparation of \nlegislations and extensive consultations with various stakeholders including consumers, the \ngovernment requested ADB\u2019s support for this.  \n \n11.  Under reform pillar 3, the government is considering a new power market model and a \nPPP modality for the distribution sector to attract private investments. International experience \nindicates that private sector participation in distribution is conditioned to the full cost recovery, \nfunctioning regulatory framework, and transparent data and information on the asset status.8 As \na first step, the government requested ADB\u2019s assistance for an upstream exploratory study for \nsuitable PPP modalities for the distribution sector, and assessment on the distribution asset and \nmedium-term investment needs for public and private sector investments. Measures to prioritize \ninvestment in distribution network modernization and maximize the use of the existing smart \nmetering infrastructure, including a road map for smart grids, will be explored for improved \noperational efficiency.  \n \n12.  The proposed TA will help the government (i) pursue the implementation of the power \nsector reform and preparation of subprogram 2, (ii) develop an investment program for the \ndistribution sector, (iii) explore PPP modalities in the distribution sector, and (iv) build up capacity \nto implement the ensuing projects.9 All outputs produced under the TA will be provided to AFD\u2019s \nongoing study for electricity sector greenhouse gas (GHG) modeling up to 2050 under pillar 3 to \n \n7  ADB. 2020.

The \nmodernization of the distribution network and reduction of high technical losses are among the \nimportant climate change mitigation measures in the energy sector. The master plan will help \naddress  climate  change  challenges  that  may  constrain  long-term  investments  and  explore \nclimate-resilient pathways in the long-term sector development strategy.   \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n13.  Output 1: Regulatory and legislative framework to advance the power sector reform \ndeveloped. Output 1 will finance technical and legal analyses and policy advice to develop \nlegislative documents for the independent energy regulator and provide ad hoc support for the \nemerging issues during implementation. Key activities will include (i) extensive research on \nlegislative  frameworks for  independent regulators  in  other  countries  to  draw  lessons from; \n(ii) development of draft legislative documents; (iii) study tours, stakeholder consultations, and \nworkshops,  including  with  local  civil  society  organizations;  and  (iv)  development  of  the \ncommunication strategy for the public. The exploration of PPP in the distribution sector will identify \ngaps in legislations and review the most feasible mechanism in line with the ongoing sector reform.  \n \n14.  Output 2: Distribution network development and smart-grid master plan prepared. \nOutput 2 will finance the analytical works for the distribution sector development master plan to \naddress high losses, reliability issues, and increasing electricity demand. Key activities will include \n(i) reviewing the national investment plan in terms of the long-term power supply\u2013demand balance; \n(ii) identifying current and future major load centers and problems of balancing electricity supply \nand  demand,  potentially  including  electric  vehicle  integration,  distributed  renewable  energy \nresources, and energy storage; (iii) conducting least-cost analysis among technology options and \ninvestment projects; (iv) setting a digitalization goal in time and developing associated smart-grid \nroad  map;  and  (v)  identifying  short,  medium,  and  long-term  investment  priorities  and  cost \nestimates. This output is an important climate change mitigation measure for the implementation \nof Uzbekistan\u2019s commitment under the Paris Agreement and GHG reductions set in the Nationally \nDetermined Contributions and can also contribute to climate change adaptation by making the \nnetwork more resilient to the climate change.   \n \n15.  Output  3:  Institutional  capacity  in  distribution  system  planning  strengthened.  \nOutput 3 will build the staff capacity of Joint-Stock Company Regional Electric Power Networks \n(JSC REN) in distribution system planning, design, economic analysis, and budgeting to keep the \nmaster plan updated and relevant. Output 3 will also broaden JSC REN\u2019s understanding of new \ntechnologies, international trends, and important issues affecting the energy sector, including the \ndevelopment of the utility reform program to improve the sustainability of its operations. Women \nwill comprise at least 30% of the training participants.  \n \n16.  Innovative approach and new technology application. The master plan under output \n2 will explore pathways to digitalize the distribution network, accommodate prospective distributed \nsmall-scale renewables and energy storage systems, and identify ways to maximize the use of \nthe advanced metering infrastructure with a view to transforming the grid into a cleaner, smarter, \nand more flexible one while lowering the total system cost. To this end, the master plan will include \na road map for the smart grid. The master plan will integrate climate resilience in the grid planning \nthrough the following key activities: (i) formulating project selection criteria and assessment tools, \nand taking climate resilience into consideration in addition to technical, financial, environmental, \nand socioeconomic characteristics; and (ii) applying climate adaptation measures in the system \ndesign such as redundancy in the control systems, multiple distribution routes, and use of heat \nresistance materials. The smart-grid option will help make the system more resilient.  \n ", "5 \n17.  ADB  value  addition  and  lessons  learned.  This  TA  draws  on  lessons  from  the \ninternational experiences in the power sector reform. Adequate analytical support, high-level \npolicy dialogue, and capacity building are critical prerequisite for pushing forward the reform \nagenda. ADB will continue to provide support to implement complex reforms with a dedicated TA \nfor subprogram 2. The TA benefited from the close coordination with development partners, \nincluding the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund (EAKPF) and the \nCooperation Fund for Project Preparation in the Greater Mekong Subregion and in Other Specific \nAsian Countries (AFD GMS).10 Strong coordination with other development partners has provided \na unified reform package to the government. Besides, ADB assisted the government by leading \nthe development of the long-term power sector master plan and shifting the government\u2019s policy \ndirection toward upscaling renewables and decarbonizing the sector.11 The proposed distribution \nnetwork development master plan will complete the wholistic sector development plan (para. 8).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000 of which (i) $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-7); (ii) $500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the EAKPF; and (iii) $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the AFD GMS, \nboth to be administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1.  \n \n19.  The EAKPF and the AFD GMS resources will be used to finance outputs 2 and 3 and/or \nexpenditures for services from ADB member countries following ADB\u2019s applicable guidelines and \nprocedures. The EAKPF will not be used for (i) civil works, (ii) procurement of large-scale \nequipment, (iii) permanent staffing costs, or (iv) hiring of staff consultants, unless otherwise \nagreed between the Government of Korea and ADB.12 The AFD GMS has no list of eligible \nexpenditure, but ADB will administer the AFD GMS in the same degree of care and diligence as \nit exercises with respect to the administration and management of its own resources.  \n \n20.
