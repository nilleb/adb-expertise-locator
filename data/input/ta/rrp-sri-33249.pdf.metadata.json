Initial environmental examinations were undertaken; \nAssessment  a summary environmental analysis is a core appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The Project is designed to assist vulnerable coastal communities \nin the Eastern Province to improve livelihoods, meet basic needs, \nand strengthen community management of natural resources. The \nProject  will  also  strengthen  government  capacity  for  resource \nmanagement  and  planning.  All  project  interventions  will  be \nassessed to ensure that they support the peace building process \nand contribute to postconflict reconciliation at the community level. \nThe  core  project  area  will  cover  396  Grama  Niladhari  (GN) \ndivisions that border the open coast or major lagoon systems, with \ninitial  targeting  of  about  150  GN  divisions  identified  as  most \nvulnerable for assistance early in the Project. \n \nRationale  Coastal communities in the East are characterized by high levels \nof poverty, weak and fragmented social institutions, inadequate \nand  damaged  physical  infrastructure,  and  reduced  access  to \nservices and markets. The long period of conflict has disrupted \nlivelihoods, resulted in a loss of productive assets (fishing boats \nand  gear)  and  household  possessions,  limited  access  to  the \nnatural resource base, and encouraged nonsustainable resource \nuse  practices.  Communities  lack  social  cohesiveness,  and \ndisplacement  and  loss  of  family  members  and  property  have \ntraumatized people, thus diminishing self-reliance and motivation. \nWomen  have  been  particularly  affected  and have  experienced \nconflict differently from men. The conflict has resulted in a large \nproportion of households with female heads (FHHs) without social \nacceptance and the means to earn a livelihood. \n \nInstitutional capacity at the provincial and district levels for natural \nresource management and planning is also extremely limited. In \naddition, nonenforcement of environmental rules and regulations \nis  resulting  in  increasingly  adverse  impacts  on  coastal \ncommunities and the natural resource base upon which residents \ndepend for their livelihood. \n \nThe scale of the economic damage and social dislocation due to \nthe  conflict  has  severely  strained  the  Government\u2019s  ability  to \nprovide development assistance. It has therefore turned to the \ninternational community, particularly the Asian Development Bank  \n(ADB), for support.  ", "ii \n   \nObjectives   The goal of the Project is to reduce poverty and meet basic needs \nin  coastal  communities  in  the  three  districts  of  the  Eastern \nProvince.  The  project  purpose  is  sustainable  livelihood \nimprovement and sound management of natural resources. The \nmost vulnerable communities will be prioritized for support early in \nthe Project. Focus will particularly be on women, given the high \nnumber of FHHs. The Project has five components: sustainable \nlivelihood improvement; resource management in three special \nmanagement areas (SMAs\u2014Trincomalee Bay, Batticaloa Lagoon, \nand  Southern  Ampara  biodiversity  zone);  coastal  resource \nplanning;  fisheries  development;  and  project  implementation \nsupport. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $28.4  million  equivalent \ncomprising foreign exchange of $8.2 million and local currency of \n$20.2 million equivalent. Parallel cofinancing will be provided by \nthe Government of the Netherlands on a grant basis. \n   \n                                                                                          ($ million)\nFinancing Plan                               Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource        Exchange Currency  Cost  % \nADB  7.8  12.2  20.0  70.4 \nGov\u2019t. of Sri Lanka  0.0    5.6    5.6  19.7 \nGov\u2019t.of Netherlands 0.4    1.1    1.5    5.3 \nBeneficiaries  0.0    1.3    1.3    4.6 \n     \nTotal  8.2  20.2  28.4  100.0 \n \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  The proposed financing from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources is \nequivalent to Special Drawing Rights 14,009,000 ($20.0 million \nequivalent). The loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% during the \ngrace period and 1.5% thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  30 June 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,  Provincial  Councils,  and  Local \nGovernment (MHAPCLG). \n   ", "iii \nImplementation  The  North  East  Provincial  Council  (NEPC)  will  be  the  lead \nArrangements  implementing agency and will be responsible for overall project \ncoordination. The Ceylon Fisheries Harbor Corporation (CFHC) \nwill  be  the  implementing  agency  for  the  fisheries  harbor \nrehabilitation  activities.  The  National  Development  Trust  Fund \n(NDTF) will manage and coordinate the Project\u2019s microfinance \ndelivery system under a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to \nADB. The Central Environmental Agency (CEA) will implement the \nproject activities financed by the Government of the Netherlands, \nwhich relate in part to strengthening the capacity of its regional \nand subregional offices in the North and East. A provincial level \ncoordinating committee, chaired by the chief secretary of NEPC, \nwill  be  established  for  project  coordination,  direction,  and \nguidance.  Project  loan  funds  will  be  routed  to  NEPC  through \nMHAPCLG in an arrangement similar to that adopted under other \nforeign-funded projects in the North and East. Implementation of \nthe  community-level  interventions  will  be  undertaken  with  the \nassistance of implementing partner nongovernment organizations \n(IP-NGOs).  \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan \nwill  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement.  ADB-financed  civil  works  contracts  estimated  to \ncost the equivalent of more than $1.0 million will be awarded on \nthe basis of international competitive bidding (ICB), while those \nvalued at $1.0 million or less will be carried out following the \nGovernment\u2019s  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures \nsatisfactory  to  ADB.  Supply  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the \nequivalent of more than $500,000 will be awarded on the basis of \nICB; those between $500,000 and $100,000 will be awarded on \nthe basis of international shopping. Minor items costing less than \n$100,000 equivalent may be procured through direct purchase; \nsmall items costing less than $10,000 equivalent will be procured \nby communities under arrangements developed by the Ministry of \nFinance for community development projects and acceptable to \nADB.  Notwithstanding  the  above,  the  award  of  civil  works \ncontracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $50,000 or less and \nsupply contracts for equipment and materials estimated to cost \nthe equivalent of $50,000 or less, except for the first three such \ncontracts in each project district, will be subject to ADB\u2019s post \nfacto approval procedures. \n   ", "iv \nConsulting Services  Consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. A team of domestic and international consultants will \nbe engaged to undertake two categories of tasks: (i) to provide \nproject management support to the project office (PO) and the \ndistrict project offices (DPOs); and (ii) to advise and guide the PO, \nDPOs, and implementing agencies on technical aspects of project \nactivities relating to components 1, 2, and 3. Outside assistance \nwill be sought in a number of other areas: (i) IP-NGOs will be \nengaged  to  assist  with  implementing  community-level \ninterventions in components 1 and 2; (ii) implementation of the \nstrategic studies for coastal resource management in the Northern \nProvince  will  be  outsourced  to  a  team  of  international  and \ndomestic  consultants;  (iii)  the  detailed  designs  and  feasibility \nstudies for the fisheries harbor rehabilitation will be contracted out \nto qualified international engineering firms; (iv) the provision of \nlivelihood  and  enterprise  development  services  (LEDS)  will  be \noutsourced to contractors; and (v) project impact assessments will \nbe carried out by outside contractors.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  Economic  benefits  will  be  generated  from  investments  in  (i) \nBeneficiaries  community  infrastructure  and  environmental  improvements;  (ii) \nsustainable  livelihood  interventions;  (iii)  resource  management \nand  planning;  and  (iv)  fisheries  infrastructure.  Investments  in \ncommunity infrastructure will improve productivity and health, and \nhave  the  potential  to  reduce  household  medical  costs. \nEnvironmental improvements will enhance household quality of \nlife and sustain growth in tourism. The livelihood interventions will \nresult in incremental production of a broad range of products, with \nthe  potential  to  raise  the  incomes  of  the  poorest  households \nsubstantially at full development. Improved resource management \nwill  reduce  the  economic  losses  from  inefficient  and \nenvironmentally destructive resource-based activities that would \nhave occurred in the absence of the Project. Investments in the \nfisheries harbors will increase the productivity of both fishers and \nshore-based  businesses.  In  particular,  the  facilities  will  attract \nmore boats, especially multiday boats that can operate outside the \nimmediate coastline where fishing pressure is currently high, and \nwill help facilitate development of an export-based fishing industry \non the east coast. \n \nOf the approximately 110,000 households in the project area, the \nvast  majority  are  poor.  The  Project  will  target  about  40,000 \nhouseholds  judged  to  be  most  vulnerable  for  early  assistance \nthrough social infrastructure and livelihood support interventions, \nconcentrating the activities on households with female heads that \nare among the poorest of the poor. \n   ", "v \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  will  be  implemented  in  a  changing  political  and \ninstitutional  environment,  and  as  such  will  face  considerable \npolitical, institutional, social, and security risks. With the ongoing \npeace  building  activities,  the  political  and  security  risks  are \nconsiderably reduced. However, until there is a formal resolution \nbetween negotiating parties, these risks will remain. The Project \nhas a number of important design and implementation features \naimed at managing and mitigating the other risks, including (i) \nidentifying and initially prioritizing project interventions to the most \nvulnerable communities and important natural resource systems \nwithin  the  project  area;  (ii)  implementing  approaches  that  are \nresponsive to the special challenges posed by the post-conflict \nsituation  to  ensure  that  project  activities  do  not  widen  ethnic \ndivisions;  (iii)  providing  LEDS  to  help  ensure  that  livelihood \nimprovements  supported  under  the  Project  are  sustainable, \nequally accessible to women, and provide acceptable financial \nreturns; and (iv) promoting a partnership between various levels of \ngovernment,  nongovernment  organizations,  the  private  sector, \ncommunity-based  organizations,  and  beneficiaries  in \nimplementing project activities to ensure efficient service delivery. \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "vii \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  North  East  Coastal  Community \nDevelopment Project.1 \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The humanitarian and economic impacts of the 20-year-long armed conflict between the \nSri Lankan Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been severe. \nApproximately 2.5 million persons (nearly 15% of the population) lived in areas of direct military \nactivity. More than 60,000 persons were killed during the conflict, while another 800,000 were \ninternally displaced, including about 170,000 living in refugee camps. The Central Bank of Sri \nLanka estimates that the conflict reduced the country\u2019s annual growth rate by 2-3 percentage \npoints over the past two decades. The disruption of economic activity is also estimated to have \ndecreased the contribution of the North and East to national gross domestic product from 15% \nin the early 1980s to less than 4% at present. The central Government\u2019s fiscal position has also \ndeteriorated significantly and severely constrains its ability to finance development activities. \n \n3.  The worst impacts of the conflict have been felt in the war-torn Northern Province and \nEastern Province. While national poverty levels have been stable in the 20-25% range over the \npast decade, poverty rates in the North and East (which have been excluded from national \nstatistical surveys for the past 17 years) are believed to be as high as 60%. There are an \nestimated 30,000 war widows and 300,000 displaced children in the North and East where the \nschool dropout rate is twice the national average. In addition, the infant mortality rate in the \nNorth and East is twice the national average, the maternal mortality rate is three times the \nnational average, and virtually all malaria deaths in Sri Lanka occur in the region.  \n \n4.  Poverty in the North and East is largely conflict related (Appendix 1). While the direct \nloss of life has had the most dramatic impact, the conflict has also weakened the economic and \nsocial resilience of the affected communities, with the rise of households headed by females \nbeing one of the most visible impacts. Conflict-related displacement has resulted in destruction \nor loss of assets, including housing, farm equipment, and fishing vessels/gear. Restrictions on \nmobility  and  increased  perceptions  of  risk  during  the  conflict  have  also  affected  people\u2019s \ncapacity for earning a living as has loss of access to services and markets. The mobility \nrestrictions and high overall poverty levels have led to overexploitation of the natural resource \nbase and environmentally destructive resource-use practices. The displacement and destruction \nof livelihoods have in turn left many people dependent on external support for their survival.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n5.  Loss or impairment of livelihoods is the major cause of the high poverty levels in coastal \ncommunities in the East, where the long period of conflict resulted in loss of productive assets \n(particularly fishing boats and gear) and household possessions, and limited access to the \nnatural  resource  base.  The  people  of  the  eastern  coastal  communities  have  traditionally \ndepended directly on the resources in the marine, lagoon, and terrestrial environments for their \nsustenance and survival. Dependence on natural resources is significantly higher in these \n                                                 \n1  While  the  Project  is  primarily  focused  on  the  Eastern  Province,  some  capacity  building  for  environmental \nenforcement and a feasibility study for a possible follow on project in the Northern Province will also be undertaken. ", "2  \ncommunities than in neighboring inland settlements. The conflict radically altered patterns of \naccess to coastal ecosystems, and caused inefficiencies and direct damage that have resulted \nin waste or loss of valuable natural assets, thus disrupting traditional livelihoods. \n \n6.  The majority of the population in eastern coastal communities nevertheless continue to \nearn their income from fishing and farming, with the poorest groups surviving primarily through \nlow wage labor in agriculture and fisheries, and informal sector activities. An estimated 30% of \nhouseholds in coastal communities are directly employed in fishing, against 10-15% for the \nprovince as a whole. Problems in the fisheries sector include restricted access to the resource \nbase due to security concerns and, partly due to this, overexploitation of nearshore coastal and \nlagoon resources; destruction and loss of infrastructure (e.g., harbors), vessels, and fishing \ngear; monopolization of market access along ethnic lines; poor fish handling and processing, \nresulting in high postharvest losses and low output values; and absence of support services \n(credit,  research  and  extension,  and  functioning  cooperatives).  The  conflict  also  seriously \naffected agricultural activity as provision of agricultural support services virtually ceased and \nproductive land became inaccessible due to access restrictions and land mines. \n \n7.  Environmental  pressures,  which  were  held  somewhat  in  check  during  the  conflict, \nintensified after the initiation of the peace process in late 2001 and are also contributing to the \nhigh poverty rates in the region. In particular, the current lack of enforcement of environmental \nlaws and regulations is resulting in increasing degradation of the natural resource base. The \ncoastal areas of the East have a large number of ecologically significant areas that provide \nhabitat for fish and wildlife, support rich biodiversity, create buffers against flooding and erosion, \nand provide filters to limit pollution. In addition, coastal ecosystems are the foundation of most of \nthe  region\u2019s  economic  activity,  and  have  the  potential  for  major  ecotourism  development. \nInstitutions at the provincial and district levels have limited capacity to protect the environment \nand undertake effective resource management and planning. Moreover, a number of national \nagencies  that  have  responsibility  for  environmental  protection  and  natural  resource \nmanagement have limited capacity to undertake their functions.  \n \n8.  Against this background, a key development priority for the North East Provincial Council \n(NEPC) is to initiate interventions that directly assist poor coastal communities to improve \nlivelihoods and meet basic needs. These interventions are to be undertaken in parallel with \nactivities to improve resource management and planning, within both government and recipient \ncommunities, and to provide fisheries infrastructure to facilitate development of the local fishing \nindustry.2 A key criterion for community-based activities is that they must enhance the capacity \nof the communities to sustain any assets provided. Dependency on external support must also \nnot be increased, and communities\u2019 capacity to meet operation and maintenance (O&M) costs \nmust be improved. Capacity building and exit strategies will therefore be essential elements \nwhen preparing community-based activities. \n \n9.  The  Project  is  accordingly  focused  on  assisting  vulnerable  coastal  communities  in \nimproving  livelihoods,  meeting  basic  needs, and  strengthening  the  management  of  natural \nresources.  As  an  investment  loan,  the  Project  moves  beyond  the  provision  of  emergency \nassistance to development of interventions that provide an enabling environment for people to \ntake advantage of the economic opportunities afforded by the peace process. In addition, the \nProject draws lessons from ongoing interventions in the North and East in assisting vulnerable \npeople in regaining productive lives. In particular, a process approach has been adopted to \npermit flexible adjustment of project design during implementation. This will be particularly \n                                                 \n2 There is an abundant large pelagic fish resource off Sri Lanka\u2019s east coast, particularly tuna. A recent study \nsuggests that less than half of the potential sustainable yield of this resource is currently being harvested.  ", "  3\nimportant in the present context, given that the security environment is still very fluid and that \nmost  local  people  remain  traumatized  by  the  conflict.  Other  important  lessons  include \nrecognition of (i) the need to ensure that a balance is maintained in project activities among \nethnic groups; (ii) the need to undertake activities in both government-controlled and LTTE-\ncontrolled areas; (iii) the limited implementation capacity of local government institutions; and \n(iv) the critical need to coordinate the large number of projects in the North and East. \n \n10.  The Project is in line with the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy.3 In addition, in \nthe poverty partnership agreement, the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhave  agreed  that  ADB  will  assist  in  addressing  conflict-related  poverty.4  Moreover,  ADB\u2019s \nCountry  Strategy  and  Program  endorses  the  Government\u2019s  priority  to  reduce  poverty  and \nfacilitate  the  development  of  sustainable  natural  resource  management  systems  so  as  to \nimprove livelihoods and support sustainable long-term economic growth. Finally, the Project \naddresses key priorities as identified in the recently completed Assessment of Needs in the \nConflict Affected Areas undertaken jointly by ADB, United Nations Development Program, and \nWorld Bank, and complements well planned and ongoing assistance from ADB and other \ndevelopment partners (Appendix 2).  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n11.  The  goal  of  the  Project  is  to  reduce  poverty  and  meet  basic  needs  in  coastal \ncommunities in three districts (Trincomalee, Batticaloa, and Ampara) of Eastern Province. The \npurpose is sustainable livelihood improvement and sound management of natural resources. \nThe core project area comprises the 396 Grama Niladhari (GN) divisions5 in the province on the \nopen coast and around major lagoons and is delineated based on the linkages between coastal \ncommunities and the natural resource base on which they depend for their livelihoods. The \nproject area has a population of about 550,000 out of a total of 1.5 million in Eastern Province.6 \nThe project beneficiaries include fishers, fisher-agriculturalists, small farmers, landless laborers, \nand small entrepreneurs. There will be a special focus on women as the most disadvantaged \namong this target group (Appendix 3). \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n12.  The Project comprises five components: sustainable livelihood improvement; resource \nmanagement in three special management areas (SMAs); coastal resource planning; fisheries \ndevelopment; and project implementation support. The project framework is in Appendix 4. \n \n1.  Sustainable Livelihood Improvement \n \n13.  Sustainable  livelihood  improvement,  which  will  be  equally  accessible  to  men  and \nwomen, will focus on activities in agriculture, fisheries, agroforestry, and related enterprises \nservicing and adding value to these subsectors. Appropriate nontraditional livelihoods, including \n                                                 \n3  Government of Sri Lanka. 2002.

Colombo. \n5 The GN division is the lowest administrative level in Sri Lanka and commonly consists of 2\u20133 villages, with a \npopulation limit set at 250 families. \n6  The ethnic composition of the coastal area differs markedly from that of the Eastern Province as a whole: 3% of the \npopulation in coastal GN divisions are Sinhalese, 38% are Tamil, and 59% are Muslim, versus about 25% \nSinhalese, 40% Tamil, and 35% Muslim for the entire province. ", "4  \ntourism and waste management, will also be supported. In undertaking the livelihood support \nactivities, emphasis will be on developing livelihood clusters\u2014linkages between supply of raw \nmaterials and value-added production, and access to transport and marketing facilities\u2014to \nensure  the sustainability  and  financial  viability  of  the  interventions.  There  will be  separate \nclusters for women. Livelihood and enterprise development services (LEDS) will be provided to \nfacilitate identification of market opportunities, relevant technology transfer, small business and \nentrepreneurship  training,  provision  of  mentoring  support,  and  development  of  livelihood \nclusters.7 The livelihood improvement activities will be financed through a microfinance delivery \nsystem established under the Project. \n \n14.  After a comprehensive needs assessment, support will be provided at the community \nlevel  to  meet  basic  needs  through  small-scale  infrastructure.  Community  infrastructure \ninterventions eligible for funding include the construction and rehabilitation of minor roads, \nculverts,  drains,  small-scale  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  simple  solid  waste \nmanagement schemes, and community buildings (e.g., multipurpose buildings, including day \ncare and playground facilities).8 Fishing communities that meet predetermined selection criteria \nwill also be eligible to receive simple fisheries support infrastructure, including net repair sheds, \nmarket/auction  halls,  fisher  rest  houses,  and  cold  storage  facilities.  The  community \ninfrastructure interventions, including the fisheries infrastructure, will be assessed and selected \non  the  basis  of  specific  social  and  environmental  criteria  (Appendix  5).  The  recipient \ncommunities themselves will manage and maintain the infrastructure facilities, which will be \nfinanced directly by the Project. \n \n15.  Livelihood  support  and  community  infrastructure  provision  will  initially  focus  on  GN \ndivisions identified as the poorest and most vulnerable. In the absence of reliable statistical data \non poverty and livelihoods, proxy data combined with qualitative information were used to \nidentify 146 of the 396 GN divisions in the project area (Appendix 5). In total, about 225 GN \ndivisions are expected to receive support under the Project. Small but extremely poor and \nmarginalized communities of coastal indigenous people also reside within the vulnerable GN \ndivisions. A separate set of livelihood interventions will be developed to ensure that their specific \nneeds are addressed in a socially sensitive manner.9 \n \n2.  Resource Management in Three Special Management Areas (SMAs) \n \n16.  Three  SMAs\u2014Trincomalee  Bay,  Batticaloa  Lagoon,  and  the  Southern  Ampara \nbiodiversity zone\u2014were selected for interventions to improve natural resource management and \naddress  acute  environmental  problems.  These  objectives  are  important  as  most  economic \nactivity in the SMAs depends heavily on the natural resource base. The three SMAs were \nselected  on  the  basis  of  environmental  and  ecological  criteria  such  as  significant  natural \n                                                 \n7  The  rationale  for  providing  these  services  is  based  on  the  observation  that  the  vast  majority  of  potential \nbeneficiaries lack technical and market information, business skills, access to financial services, and market \nlinkages. The envisaged approach to provision of LEDS has worked well under the ongoing ADB-financed \nSouthern Province Rural Economic Advancement Project. \n8 The Project seeks to meet the immediate basic needs of the selected communities. Assistance for larger \ninfrastructure  works  is  being  provided  under  the  ADB-financed  North  East  Community  Restoration  and \nDevelopment Project (NECORD) and the World Bank-financed North East Irrigated Agriculture Project (NEIAP). \nAssistance in the social areas\u2014such as in community nutrition and health\u2014is being provided by bilateral sources. \n9  There are small communities of such people (coastal Veddas) in Batticaloa and Trincomalee districts. Most Veddas \nrefrain from acknowledging their identity due to social stigmatization by neighboring communities. The Project will \nevaluate their status through a culturally sensitive participatory needs assessment to identify priority areas for \ninterventions. These could include construction of community infrastructure as well as improving incomes, while \nmaintaining their seminomadic livelihoods in fishing, and hunting and gathering.  ", "  5\nresource systems where a very high proportion of the local population obtain livelihoods. Their \ndefining features are as follows: \n \n(i)  Trincomalee Bay. The bay is a large natural harbor and has significant potential \nfor  economic  development.  Currently,  major  areas  of  localized  pollution, \nshoreline erosion, and coastal resource degradation are affecting livelihoods. \n \n(ii)  Batticaloa Lagoon. The lagoon is a critical natural resource area and provides \nlivelihoods  for  a  very  large  proportion  of  the  local  population.  It  is  also \necologically and environmentally significant, and is at risk from overexploitation of \nits resource base and shore-based pollution entering the lagoon system. \n \n(iii)  Southern  Ampara  biodiversity  zone.  Key  resource  issues  within  this  SMA \ninclude  nonsustainable  practices  by  resource  users  (e.g.,  sand  mining  and \ndynamite fishing), lack of effective management of ecologically sensitive areas, \nand an absence of integrated management of sanctuary areas.10 The area also \nhas significant potential for tourism development. \n \n17.  The Project will provide assistance to carry out resource mapping and identify resource \nmanagement problems (i.e., environmental hot spots) that affect livelihoods and the quality of \nlife at the community level within the SMAs. Typical hot spots include areas of mangrove \ndestruction, sand and coral mining, and uncontrolled solid waste dumping. The Project will help \nimplement selected community-based resource management interventions to address these \nproblems, including mangrove replanting, solid waste management, introduction of alternative \nenergy sources (such as solar power), and implementation of public awareness programs. In \naddition,  the  Project  will  support  habitat  conservation  activities,  such  as  demarcation  of \nenvironmentally  sensitive  areas  and  formation  of  local  resource  management  groups.  The \nresource  management  interventions  at  the  community  level  will  be  closely  linked  to  the \nlivelihood support activities in component 1 to ensure the sustainability of the latter.  \n \n18.  Resource mapping at the community level will be consolidated and further elaborated \ninto  SMA  plans  that  address  key  resource  management  issues  and  acute  environmental \nproblems.  The  district-level  SMA  plans  may  identify  the  need  to  implement  environmental \ninterventions at a scale above the community level, for example, solid waste management \nschemes or remedial measures to mitigate the effects of sand mining, which will involve several \nGN divisions. This would entail identifying suitable implementation partners, and formulating and \nimplementing  sustainable  intervention  strategies.  Whenever  possible,  these  larger-scale \ninterventions will be linked to the community-based interventions described earlier. All resource \nmanagement  interventions,  including  community-level  interventions,  will  be  assessed  and \nselected on the basis of specific criteria (Appendix 5). \n \n3.  Coastal Resource Planning \n \n19.  A  coastal  resource  management  plan  for  the Eastern  Province  will  be  prepared  to \nestablish a consistent framework for provincial coastal resource planning and management. The \nplan, among others, will encompass shoreline management and tourism development in the \ncoastal zone. The plan will link up with, and have application to, other associated development \nand  sector plans,  including  the  national  coastal  zone  plan.  Assistance  will  be provided  to \nimprove  systems  for  resource  management  (including  implementation  of  zoning)  and \n                                                 \n10 A sanctuary is the lowest form of protection enforcement under the Department of Wildlife Conservation, where \nprivate land ownership, human settlements, and economic activities are permitted. ", "6  \nenforcement of relevant environmental laws and regulations, and to strengthen the capacity of \nthe relevant agencies in the province to implement such systems. A study on coastal resource \nmanagement issues in the Northern Province that could form the basis of a follow-on investment \nsimilar to the Project will also be supported under this component. \n \n20.  The  Project  will  improve  the  capacity  of  local  government  agencies  to  undertake \nplanning, coordinate aid agency interventions, prepare natural resource management plans, \nand efficiently integrate these plans into specific sector and overall development plans. These \noutcomes will be achieved through institutional capacity building with staff training at provincial, \ndistrict,  and  divisional  levels;  and  investing  in  equipment  to  improve  existing  database \nmanagement systems, incorporating gender-disaggregated information where appropriate. The \npreparation of community resource management plans in component 2 will also contribute to \nimproved coastal resource planning. \n \n4.  Fisheries Development \n \n21.  This component will support the development of a more efficient and productive fishing \nindustry on the east coast by rehabilitating the two major fisheries harbor facilities found there: \nValaichchenai and Cod Bay. The Project will also support private sector participation in onshore \ncommercial activities at the two harbor facilities. Training programs aimed at improving fish \nhandling and processing methods will be conducted for fishing industry participants. \n \n22.  The fisheries harbor facilities in Valaichchenai were badly damaged during the conflict \nand have been closed since 1990. The following activities are proposed: improve the sea \nentrance and the harbor access channel; provide mooring and boat lifting facilities; improve the \nfish-landing  wharf;  rehabilitate  existing  buildings;  provide  fire-fighting  and  first  aid  facilities; \nrehabilite roads and parking areas; and provide additional utilities and services (e.g., power \nsupply, garbage collection, ice, and radio communication). The facilities at the only functioning \nfisheries harbor on the east coast at Cod Bay deteriorated significantly during the conflict period \nand will also be upgraded. Development activities at this site include extending the waterfront \n(fish landing wharf and jetty), improving the slipway, and providing some onshore facilities (for \nrepairs, flaked ice, cold storage, and other services).11 The improved facilities at the two sites \nwill allow safe moorings and sea access year round for vessels (particularly multiday boats), \nspeed up refueling and provisioning, and permit more efficient and hygienic fish handling. The \nshorter turnaround time in port and better handling will in turn minimize waste and improve the \noverall quality of the fish catch. \n \n23.  Physical  improvement  at  the  two  harbor  facilities  will  be  preceded  by  an  in-depth \npreparation phase in which stakeholders will be consulted to revalidate the needs assessment \nundertaken during project preparation. The consultation process in both locations will proceed in \nphases and give careful attention to the distribution of benefits among the local Tamil, Muslim, \nand  Sinhalese  communities  to  ensure  the  social  viability  of  the  proposed  activities.  The \nstakeholder consultation process will be followed by full feasibility studies, detailed engineering \ndesigns, and preparation of tender documents. To avoid any possible scope for resettlement \nimpacts, the rehabilitation activities at Valaichchenai will be confined to the current harbor area. \nPhysical  implementation  of  rehabilitation  works  is  scheduled  to  begin  during  year  2  in \nValaichchenai and year 5 in Cod Bay.  \n \n                                                 \n11 To ensure that the rehabilitation of Cod Bay is consistent with the planned long-term development of Trincomalee \nBay,  the  rehabilitation  work  will  only  be  initiated  after  the  completion  and  adoption  of  a  comprehensive \ndevelopment plan for the area. For this reason, the rehabilitation of Cod Bay is planned for the second half of the \nproject period. An alternative site has been identified in the event it is decided not to proceed with Cod Bay. ", "  7\n24.  Improper handling has contributed to the poor quality of fish and fish products on the \neast coast. Training and awareness programs covering improved fish handling and onboard \nstorage methods, as well as improved processing and marketing methods, will therefore be \nconducted for fishing industry participants\u2014fishers, boat owners, processors, and traders. This \nis critical to the development of an export-oriented fishing industry, as raw material procurement \nand processing have to conform to stringent international quality standards and regulations. \nMaintenance of the quality of the fish catch is a particular area of concern because of the \nincreasing fleet of multiday boats, which access the offshore fishing grounds. \n \n5.  Project Implementation Support \n \n25.  This component includes establishment and operation of management and monitoring \nsystems to support timely and cost-effective project implementation. It will consist of provision of \nproject  and  financial  management  support;  engagement  of  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs)  and  other  service  providers,  especially  those  with  a  particular  focus  on  women; \nprocurement  of  equipment,  supplies  and  materials;  and  the  establishment  of  accounting, \nauditing,  monitoring  and  reporting  systems.  An  impact  assessment  framework,  and  an \ninformation, education and communication (IEC) system, will also be established. The IEC \nstrategy and plan seeks to (i) provide easy access to the most current project information; (ii) \ninitiate  and  guide  awareness  campaigns,  events,  and  training;  and  (iii)  establish  efficient \ninformation and communications mechanisms among project implementation partners and with \nother relevant development initiatives. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n26.  The Project has a number of important design and implementation features to address \nthe special needs of the project area. These include (i) identifying and initially prioritizing project \ninterventions to the most vulnerable communities and important natural resource systems within \nthe project area; (ii) implementing approaches that are responsive to the special challenges \nposed by the postconflict situation to ensure that project activities do not widen ethnic divisions; \n(iii) providing LEDS to help ensure the livelihood improvements supported under the Project are \nsustainable, give equal access to women, and provide acceptable financial returns; and (iv) \nforming  a  partnership  between  various  levels  of  government,  NGOs,  the  private  sector, \ncommunity based organizations (CBOs), and beneficiaries in project activities. The Project will \nadopt a gender strategy to address the specific concerns and needs of women (Appendix 3). \n \n27.  A  variety  of  approaches  have  been  integrated  into  the  design  and  implementation \narrangements to ensure that the project interventions strengthen peace building and contribute \nto community reconciliation. Community consultation and participation are at the core of project \nplanning and implementation so that potential constraints on project activities and interventions \ncan be identified and dealt with effectively at an early stage. Activities will be phased so that the \nProject can adapt to the evolving peace process. A \u201cdo no harm\u201d approach will be applied so \nthat  negotiated  solutions  can  be  found  for  any  activity  that  could  widen  divisions  within \ncommunities, or fuel further conflict. The ethnic composition of the project area will also be \ntaken into account in identifying beneficiaries for specific project interventions. All major project \ndocuments (including recruitment announcements and tender notices) will be translated and \nmade available in the three official languages. Agreed upon implementation procedures will also \nensure that criteria and procedures for selecting beneficiaries and implementation partners, and \nawarding contracts are entirely transparent to avoid any perception of resource misuse. \n \n28.  The provision of LEDS will help project beneficiaries to (i) identify and assess market \nopportunities  for  different  products,  services,  and  enterprises;  (ii)  identify  environmentally ", "8  \nfriendly and appropriate technology alternatives; and (iii) prepare business plans for proposed \nenterprises. The provision of LEDS will be facilitated by (i) specialized training in enterprise-\nrelated technical and managerial aspects; (ii) linking small-scale entrepreneurs with successful \nlarger-scale entrepreneurs through a mentoring program; and (iii) implementing programs to \nintroduce new technologies. The concept is to link private sector entities and NGOs currently \nproviding such services to potential beneficiaries. An integral LEDS function will be to take \naffirmative action toward empowering women entrepreneurs. \n \n29.  Project activities will be programmed and implemented at the district level and below, \nwith coordination taking place at the provincial level. Implementation will involve a partnership \nbetween local NGOs selected according to specified criteria in each district and the district \nplanning offices, while NGOs with specialist skills, other local government agencies, and the \nproject consultant team will provide technical support as required. The focus will be on building \nthe capacity of the local government and implementing partner NGOs (IP-NGOs), as well as the \nbeneficiary communities themselves, which are the focal point for service delivery. At least one \nIP-NGO in each district will be a women\u2019s NGO.12 \n \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n \n30.  The total project cost (including interest during implementation, taxes, and physical and \nprice contingencies) is estimated at $28.4 million equivalent, comprising $8.2 million in foreign \nexchange cost and $20.2 million equivalent in local currency. The project cost estimates are \nsummarized in Table 1.

", "  9\n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n31.  It is proposed that ADB finance the Project with a loan not exceeding the equivalent of \n$20 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The Borrower will be the Democratic Socialist \nRepublic of Sri Lanka. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period \nof 8 years. The loan will carry an interest charge of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter to be paid semiannually. Government counterpart financing will be required in \nthe amount of $5.6 million and the project beneficiaries\u2019 contribution is estimated at $1.3 million. \nBilateral parallel cofinancing of $1.5 million will be provided on a grant basis by the Government \nof the Netherlands to support capacity building in environmental protection and monitoring \nactivities. The financing plan is outlined in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n \nSource of Financing  Foreign  Local  Total  % \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nADB  7.8  12.2  20.0  70 \nGov\u2019t. of the Netherlands  0.4    1.1    1.5    5 \nBeneficiaries  -    1.3    1.3    5 \nGov\u2019t. of Sri Lanka  -    5.6    5.6  20 \nTotal  8.2  20.2   28.4         100 \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management and Coordination \n \n32.  The Ministry of Home Affairs, Provincial Councils, and Local Government (MHAPCLG) \nwill be the Executing Agency. MHAPCLG will report on project financial and implementation \nperformance. The NEPC will be the lead Implementing Agency (IA) and will be responsible for \noverall project coordination under a project implementation agreement (PIA) acceptable to ADB. \nThe  Ceylon  Fisheries  Harbor  Corporation  (CFHC)  will  be  the  IA  for  the  fisheries  harbor \nrehabilitation under a PIA acceptable to ADB. The National Development Trust Fund (NDTF) \nwill manage and coordinate the Project\u2019s $4.0 million credit line under a PIA and subsidiary loan \nagreement acceptable to ADB. The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) will implement the \nproject  activities  financed  by  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands.13  A  provincial-level \ncoordinating committee, chaired by the chief secretary of NEPC, will be established for project \ncoordination, direction, and guidance. The coordinating committee will initially meet monthly, \nand will include representatives from all implementing organizations, including the CEA, as well \nas a representative from the NGO sector.14 A national-level steering committee chaired by the \nsecretary of MHAPCLG has been established to facilitate coordination between all projects \nimplemented in the North and East that are executed by MHAPCLG and to address project-\nrelated issues of national significance. \n \n                                                 \n13 The specific project activities to be financed by parallel cofinancing have been mutually agreed upon by the CEA, \nthe Government of the Netherlands, and ADB. \n14 This will be covered by the Consortium of Humanitarian Agencies, which is an association of agencies supporting \ndevelopment work in Sri Lanka. ", "10  \n33.  A project office (PO) will be established within the Provincial Ministry of Agriculture \n(PMA)15 and will be headed by a suitably qualified project director (PD) to oversee day-to-day \nimplementation of the Project. Project offices will also be established at the district level within \nthe district secretariats (DS) and will be headed by suitably qualified deputy project directors \n(DPDs). The PD and DPDs will be selected and appointed in accordance with the Government\u2019s \nprocedures for recruiting project staff for foreign-assisted projects, acceptable to ADB. They will \nbe assisted by an adequate number of support staff, also recruited in accordance with the \naforementioned procedures. The Project will be implemented with the assistance of the existing \ndistrict  coordinating  committees  (DCCs)  and  divisional  coordinating  committee  (DVCCs).  A \nproject organization chart is in Appendix 7. \n \n34.  Project loan funds for NEPC will be routed through MHAPCLG in an arrangement similar \nto that adopted under other foreign funded projects in the North and East, e.g., the World Bank-\nsupported North East Emergency Reconstruction Program (NEERP) and the ADB-supported \nNECORD project. The Treasury will release funds directly to the NEPC and debit the amounts \naccordingly from the budget line item for MHAPCLG. The direct transfer of funds will expedite \ndisbursement, while formal routing through MHAPCLG will ensure fiduciary oversight at the \ncentral Government level. A Department of Budget circular regarding the transfer of funds under \nNECORD provides the precedent for this disbursement mechanism.  \n \n35.  The Government and the LTTE plan to negotiate a transitional administration for the \nNorth and East. Once the institutional mechanisms have been agreed upon, it will be necessary \nto  operationalize  its  workings,  introduce  appropriate  financial  controls,  and  define  new \nadministrative procedures. Until such time, the existing administrative mechanisms will continue \nto operate, and the NEPC and local government agencies falling under its jurisdiction will \nimplement the Project as set out below. The Loan Agreement provides for prior consultation \nwith and approval of ADB on any changes in administrative responsibilities under the Project. \n \n2.  Project Components \n \na.  Sustainable Livelihood Improvement \n \n36.  The community infrastructure interventions will be implemented with the assistance of \nlocal IP-NGOs contracted under the Project. The criteria established for NGO selection are set \nout in Appendix 5. The IP-NGOs will help communities identify and prioritize their needs, and \nprepare subproject concept proposals in a standard format.16 The proposals will be submitted to \nthe  relevant  DVCC  for  clearance.  The  DVCC  will  be  chaired  by  the  divisional \nsecretary/divisional assistant director of planning, and will include the divisional environmental \nofficer (DEO) and IP-NGOs. If the proposal requires a more detailed technical assessment, the \nDVCC will have the authority to request such assistance from the project consultant team. \nDepending on the nature and scope of the subproject, clearance may be required from the \nrelevant government approving agency (e.g., CEA, Coastal Conservation Department [CCD], \netc.).17 Once cleared, the subproject proposal will be resubmitted to the DVCC for final approval. \nThe subproject proponent (e.g., the recipient communities themselves in the case of community \n                                                 \n15 The PMA\u2019s functions are most closely aligned with the range of livelihood support interventions under the Project. \nSpecifically, the PMA oversees activities in agriculture, fisheries, and food processing. \n16 A number of potential IP-NGOs are already providing community infrastructure in the Eastern province. Simple, \nlow-cost  designs  utilizing  locally  available  building  materials  have  been  developed  for  basic  infrastructure \nprototypes, which will be adopted by the Project. As such, the development approach envisaged is considered to \nbe cost effective and appropriate in the local context. \n17 Clearance will also be required through the District Mine Action Committees before any community development \nactivities can be initiated. Project funds have been allocated for mine surveys and removal in the event this is \nnecessary. ", " 11\ninfrastructure) will be responsible for implementation, with the assistance of the IP-NGOs and \nthe project consultant team. Monitoring and oversight will be undertaken by the DCC, chaired by \nthe district secretary, with membership from relevant government agencies, NGO consortia, and \nthe private sector.18 \n \n37.  The IP-NGOs will also help households identify viable livelihood activities in fisheries, \nagriculture, agroforestry and a range of nontraditional activities in cooperation with the LEDS \nproviders.19 The livelihood support activities will be financed through a microfinance delivery \nsystem established under the Project. Consistent with the approach developed under the ADB-\nfinanced Rural Finance Sector Development Program (RFSDP), the NDTF will serve as the \napex agency for channeling credit to participating institutions that meet predetermined eligibility \ncriteria. The criteria adopted will be consistent with those under RFSDP. Further details are in \nAppendix 8. The credit scheme will operate initially through local microfinance NGOs (MF-\nNGOs), and will expand to a broader range of financial institutions including cooperative rural \nbanks and commercial banks, once the delivery system has developed. The strategy is to \nprovide  smaller  loans  for  livelihood  improvement  and  enterprise  development  early  in  the \nProject, and move up to larger loans and enterprises later on. \n \nb.  Resource Management in Three SMAs \n \n38.  Implementation  of  community-based  resource  mapping  and  resource  management \ninterventions  will  be  facilitated  by  the  IP-NGOs  contracted  under  the  Project.  As  in  the \ncommunity infrastructure interventions described in para. 36, the IP-NGOs will help communities \nidentify and prioritize resource management interventions, and prepare subproject proposals in \na standard format. The proposals will be submitted to the relevant DVCC for clearance and \nfunding on a grant basis. Implementation progress will be monitored by the DCCs. The IP-\nNGOs  will  also  facilitate  the  linkage  of  resource  mapping  at  the  community  level  with \npreparation of SMA plans at district level. \n \n39.  Integrated planning and subsequent management of the SMAs at the district level will be \nundertaken through SMA committees. The committees will be established by the relevant DS \nand will comprise representatives from the district departments and statutory bodies, municipal \ngovernments,  IP-NGOs,  the  private  sector,  and  civil  society.  The  main  functions  of  the \ncommittees will be to (i) approve the work plan and budget for preparing an SMA management \nplan; (ii) ensure that an adequate consultation process is followed; and (iii) provide overall policy \nguidance. Technical assistance will be provided to the committees as needed by the consultant \nnatural resource planners. Once finalized, the SMA plans will be submitted to their respective \nDCCs for endorsement.  \n \n40.  The SMA plans will also identify priority larger-scale environmental interventions for \nimplementation under the Project. Any technical assistance that may be required to formulate \nproject proposals and implementation arrangements will be provided by the project consultant \nteam or the contractors engaged to provide LEDS. The proposed interventions must clear the \n                                                 \n18 The DCCs will meet monthly to review implementation progress. Representatives from the three main stakeholder \ngroups (Government, private sector, and NGOs) from the two other districts will attend the monthly DCC meetings \nin each district on a revolving basis to enhance transparency. \n19 Organizations such as the Integrated Technology Development Group (ITDG), the Agromart Foundation (AF), and \nSarvodaya Economic Enterprise Development Services (SEEDS) will be contracted to provide LEDS. The ITDG is \na United Kingdom-based NGO that has established an independent national NGO in Sri Lanka that works to \ndisseminate  appropriate  technology.  The  AF  is  a  national  NGO  that  seeks  to  empower  the  poor  through \nentrepreneurship training, with a strong focus on women. SEEDS is a national microfinance NGO with a well-\ndeveloped microenterprise advisory unit. ", "12  \nrelevant environmental screening procedures and receive prior approval from the DCC before \nimplementation. These subprojects will be financed on a grant basis. \n \n    c.  Coastal Resource Planning \n \n41.  The provincial planning secretariat (PPS) will be the focal point for implementing the \ncoastal resource planning and capacity building activities at the provincial, district, and divisional \nlevels.  A  consultant  resource  planner  and  short-term  experts  covering  a  range  of  areas, \nincluding database management systems and tourism planning, will support the PPS. Specific \nresource assessments will be outsourced on a case-by-case basis depending on the needs that \nemerge in the course of the data collection and planning exercises. A provincial inter-agency \nplanning group will be established to ensure coordinated input by the relevant agencies involved \nin resource-based planning activities, particularly preparation of the provincial coastal resource \nmanagement  plans.  The  planning  group  will  be  chaired  by  the  deputy  chief  secretary  of \nplanning, and will include the following agencies: Urban Development Authority, Ministry of \nTourism,  Sri  Lanka  Tourist  Board,  Sri  Lanka  Ports  Authority,  CFHC,  CCD,  Fisheries \nDepartment, CEA, National Aquatic Resource Agency, Department of Wildlife Conservation, \nForestry Department, and the Sri Lankan Navy. National agencies that do not have provincial \nrepresentation  will  establish  operational  functions  in  the  region.  The  SMA  committees  will \nprovide the link between community-based planning efforts and planning activities at higher \ninstitutional levels.  \n \n42.  Implementing  strengthened  enforcement  procedures  will  require  active  community \nparticipation as well as the support of the relevant agencies. Activities related to enforcement \nprocedures will involve information dissemination and public consultation, and will build on the \noutputs of community-based planning efforts. The Project will also strengthen the regional and \nsubregional offices of the CEA in the North and East,20 which will have overall responsibility for \nenvironmental monitoring under the Project, and facilitate establishment of effective links and \ncollaboration with the NEPC. Specific project activities in this regard, which will be financed by \nthe Government of the Netherlands, include training the DEOs and other relevant government \nofficials, installing an accredited environmental testing laboratory in the region, and providing a \nmobile environmental monitoring unit. The strategic study for coastal resource management in \nthe Northern Province, which will also be financed by the Government of the Netherlands, will \nbe outsourced by CEA to outside experts. This will be done in close coordination with NEPC. \n \nd.  Fisheries Development \n43.  CFHC will be responsible for rehabilitating the fisheries harbors in Valaichchenai and \nCod Bay and managing the rehabilitated facilities. This will include (i) overseeing the conduct of \nfeasibility studies and preparing detailed engineering designs, quantities, cost estimates, and \ntender  documents;  (ii)  awarding  construction  works;  (iii)  supervising  contractors  during \nimplementation; and (iv) implementing appropriate O&M practices in the rehabilitated harbors. \nCFHC will also take the lead in organizing the stakeholder consultation process for the two \nharbor facilities. \n \n44.  CFHC  will  carry  out  operation  and  management  under  the  policies  set  out  in  its \nCorporate  Plan  2003-2007,  which  are  considered  adequate  to  ensure  cost  recovery  and \nefficient  operation  of  the  rehabilitated  harbor  facilities.21  Under  the  Project,  fishery  harbor \n                                                 \n20 The CEA is establishing a regional office in Trincomalee with subregional offices in Ampara and Jaffna. \n21 The CFHC owns and operates all of Sri Lanka\u2019s fishing harbors and currently recovers O&M costs through a \nsystem of berthage fees. CFHC has developed a new catch weight-based \u201cport gate\u201d levy on fish moving through \nits harbor facilities that will substantially improve its financial performance. ", " 13\nmanagement staff will be trained to support improved management and monitoring of the fish \ncatch.22  Efforts  will  also  be  made  to  secure  fishers\u2019  participation  in  improving  harbor \nmanagement and operations, as well as in building a monitoring mechanism. Facilities for \nonshore commercial activities will be leased out to the private sector on a competitive basis in \nline with current government policy. \n \n45.  The PO will organize the fisheries training activities and awareness campaigns, with the \nassistance  of  the  project  consultant  team.  These  programs  will  be  developed  in  close \ncooperation with existing fisheries training institutes and private sector initiatives. The Project \nwill also draw upon relevant training materials and programs developed under the CRMP. \n \ne.  Project Implementation Support \n \n46.  The PO will establish and operate project management and monitoring systems with the \nsupport of the DPOs. Project and financial management specialists will be recruited at the \nprovincial level and for each DPO to establish effective management and monitoring systems. \nThe project consultant team will implement the IEC services, while the contractors will carry out \nthe project impact assessments. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n \n47.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years (Appendix 9). Year 1 will involve setting up \nthe project management and implementation framework, and various other preparatory tasks. \nThe latter includes (i) preparing work and financial plans; (ii) procuring goods and services \n(consultants, IP-NGOs, and other service providers); (iii) designing and installing a management \ninformation system; and (iv) monitoring impacts. Producer and user groups will be mobilized \nonce the IP-NGOs are contracted. The fisheries infrastructure will be started after satisfactory \ncompletion of the social preparation and stakeholder consultation. \n \n4.  Procurement \n \n48.  Goods and services financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  ADB-financed  civil  works  contracts \nestimated to cost the equivalent of more than $1.0 million will be awarded on the basis of \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB); those costing less than $1.0 million will be carried out \nfollowing the Government\u2019s local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures satisfactory to ADB. \nSupply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of more than $500,000 will be awarded on the \nbasis of ICB, and those between $500,000 and $100,000 will be awarded on the basis of \ninternational shopping. Minor items costing less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured \nthrough direct purchase; small items costing less than $10,000 equivalent will be procured by \ncommunities  under  arrangements  developed  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  for  community \ndevelopment projects and acceptable to ADB and the lead IA. Notwithstanding the above, the \naward of civil works contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $50,000 or less and supply \ncontracts for equipment and materials estimated to cost the equivalent of $50,000 or less, \nexcept for the first three such contracts in each project district, will be subject to ADB\u2019s post \nfacto approval procedures.23 Indicative contract packages are in Appendix 10. \n \n                                                 \n22 The latter will be undertaken as part of a broader effort established under the ADB-financed Coastal Resource \nManagement Project (CRMP) seeking to create a comprehensive fish catch monitoring system to track the \nsustainability of the marine fisheries resource. \n23 If such contracts are subsequently not approved by ADB, the Government will be required to refund any payment \nmade from the loan to finance such contracts and provide financing from its own or other resources. ", "14  \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n49.  Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants.  Summary  terms  of  reference  for  the  project  consultant  team  (around  35 \ninternational  and  381  domestic  person-months)  and  various  other  consultant  packages \n(including the IP-NGOs) envisaged under the Project are in Appendix 11. Consultants will be \nprovided individually and through a firm. In recruiting consulting firms, quality and cost based \nselection procedures will be followed. To ensure that the Project is implemented without delay, \nadvance action will be allowed in recruiting individual project management consultants. The \nGovernment has been advised that ADB\u2019s support of advance action does not commit ADB to \napprove the Project or to finance the recruitment costs. To the extent possible, individual \nconsultants  and  IP-NGOs  will  be  recruited  on  a  competitive  basis.  Where  the  number  of \nqualified applicants is limited, direct selection may be used with prior approval of ADB.  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n50.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook. For the timely release of funds, imprest accounts will be established for the use of \nNEPC and CFHC. Disbursements to the NDTF and from NDTF to MF-NGOs will be made on a \nreimbursement  basis  in  accordance  with  the  subsidiary  loan  agreement  between  the \nGovernment and NDTF and the participation agreement entered into by NDTF and each MF-\nNGO.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed arrangements agreed to by \nthe Borrower and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in the imprest accounts will not \nexceed 6 months of estimated expenditure or 10% of the total loan amount, whichever is less. \nADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  (SOE)  procedures  may  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible \nexpenditures and to liquidate advances made to the imprest accounts in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nloan disbursement guidelines. Any individual payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under SOE \nprocedures will not exceed the equivalent of $50,000. The cofinancing will be disbursed in \naccordance  with  procedures  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands  and  the \nMinistry of Finance. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n51.  All  agencies  involved  in  project  implementation  will  prepare  and  maintain  separate \naccounts  for  Project-related  disbursements.  The  PMA  will  consolidate  the  accounts  of  the \nvarious DSs and the CFHC and submit them to MHAPCLG, which will review the consolidated \naccounts and, after audit, submit them to ADB. The audit report will include, among others, a \nstatement verifying that funds disbursed by ADB against SOEs have been used for the purpose \nfor which they were provided. The NDTF will be responsible for accounts and requests for \nreimbursements relating to the microfinance delivery system; it will establish a separate project \ncell to maintain detailed records on the use of loan proceeds. Project accounts (including those \nof  the  NDTF  and  the  MF-NGOs),  together  with  disbursement  documents,  will  be  audited \nannually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB, and will be submitted to ADB within 9 \nmonths of the end of each fiscal year. The imprest accounts and SOEs will be audited as part of \nthe regular annual audit of the project accounts, and a separate opinion on their use will be \nrequired  in  the  annual  audit  report.  MHAPCLG,  NEPC,  CFHC,  and  NDTF  will  ensure \nsubmission of audited project accounts within the time frame stipulated in the Loan Agreement. \n \n52.  The implementing agencies will prepare quarterly financial and physical progress reports \non their respective activities, and submit the reports to the PO for consolidation. The NDTF will ", " 15\nsubmit quarterly progress reports to the PO on the progress of its part of the Project. The report \nwill be an aggregation of the MF-NGOs quarterly reports, which will cover staffing, training, \nlending, collection, arrears performance, portfolio data, sub-borrowers\u2019 characteristics, and the \nimpact of the livelihood support activities. The NDTF will segregate ADB loan proceeds from its \nown statements and from other ongoing projects, and present separate financial statements for \nthe Project. MHAPCLG will submit quarterly to ADB progress reports on project implementation, \nwithin 1 month after the end of the quarter to which they relate, and such other reports and \ninformation relating to the Project as ADB may reasonably request. Within 3 months of physical \ncompletion of the Project, MHAPCLG will submit a project completion report to ADB. The \nresponsibility for preparing these reports and ensuring they are submitted within the agreed \nupon time frame rests with the PD. All progress reports will include gender-disaggregated \ninformation with a section devoted exclusively to the Project\u2019s impact on women, successes \nencountered, constraints faced, and efforts made to overcome them. \n \n8.  Project Performance Management System \n \n53.  During year 1 of project implementation, a project performance management system \n(PPMS) will be established at the PO with links to each district and to each project division.  The \nPPMS will be prepared in consultation with the government agencies, project management staff, \nand IP-NGOs.  Participatory monitoring and evaluation systems, which include gender specific \nindicators, will be introduced, and a mechanism to monitor the performance of the IP-NGOs will \nbe developed with the assistance of the district NGO consortia. Indicators outlined for the \nvulnerable GN selection process and other key benchmarks will be incorporated. The PPMS will \nbe part of the Project\u2019s overall computer-based management information system. Project impact \nassessment consultants under the Project will identify strategic indicators at the beginning of the \nProject and monitor them in-process twice a year and in more detail in years 3 and 6. The \nconsultants will particularly focus on gender, postconflict impact assessments, poverty impacts, \nnatural resource management, and institutional arrangements.  \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n54.  In the first 3 years of the Project, ADB will carry out semiannual reviews to (i) determine \nif the implementation arrangements are appropriate and in place and (ii) assess whether the \nvarious selection and intervention screening criteria in Appendix 5 remain appropriate. These \nreviews  will  also  track  relevant  indicators,  to  be  identified  at  the  beginning  of  project \nimplementation, to assess whether or not the overall peace/conflict climate is improving. During \nyear 3 of the Project, a comprehensive midterm review will assess performance; identify any \nproblems and constraints affecting project implementation, including changes in the security \nclimate; and reach agreement on required changes to address the shortcomings. Depending on \nprogress with the development plan for Trincomalee Bay, the midterm review may need to \nreassess the feasibility of proceeding with the rehabilitation of Cod Bay Fisheries Harbor, and \nevaluate  other  potential  sites  for  fisheries  infrastructure.  Any  required  changes  in  scope, \nactivities, and associated financial reallocation will be incorporated following the midterm review.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic Benefits \n \n55.  Economic benefits will be generated from investments in (i) community infrastructure \nand  environmental  improvements;  (ii)  sustainable  livelihood  interventions;  (iii)  resource \nmanagement  and  planning;  and  (iv)  fisheries  infrastructure.  Investments  in  community \ninfrastructure will result in improved productivity and health, and have the potential to reduce ", "16  \nhousehold medical costs. Environmental improvements will enhance household quality of life \nand  sustain  the  growth  of  tourism.  The  livelihood  interventions  will  result  in  incremental \nproduction of a broad range of products, with the potential to raise the incomes of the poorest \nhouseholds  substantially  at  full  development.  Improved  resource  management  will  reduce \neconomic losses from inefficient and environmentally destructive resource-based activities that \nwould have occurred in the absence of the Project. Investments in the fisheries harbors will \nincrease productivity of both fishers and shore-based businesses. In particular, the facilities will \nattract more boats, especially multiday boats that can operate outside the immediate coastline \nwhere fishing pressure is currently high, and will facilitate the development of an export-based \nfishing industry on the east coast. \n \n56.  Since the project-financed investments in livelihood development activities will be largely \ndetermined by a community demand-driven process, it is difficult to predict the actual mix and \nscale of outputs. Furthermore, it is not possible to quantify with any degree of precision the long-\nterm benefits of improved resource management and planning, environmental protection, or \ninvestments in community infrastructure. Therefore, a full benefit-cost analysis for the overall \nproject was considered impractical. Benefits from rehabilitating the fisheries harbors are from \nincreased boat landings due to the improved infrastructure facilities and a higher value fish \ncatch due to better handling methods and reduced wastage. The economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) for the fisheries development component is estimated at about 30%.24 Further \ndetails of the financial and economic analyses are in Appendix 12. \n \nB.  Social Measures and Impact on Poverty \n \n57.  Ethnic Segregation. Major changes in ethnic composition have occurred during the \nconflict period at the GN divisional level with communities living in separate villages or sections \nof villages. Further, with primary education being either in Tamil or Sinhalese, the education \nsystem effectively supports segregation of children of different communities at an early age. \nEthnic segregation also occurs at the enterprise and institutional levels in terms of businesses, \nin government, and in subsector activities. The fishing industry, in particular, has become highly \nsegregated along ethnic lines and the long period of conflict has resulted in a substantial loss of \nfishing assets by the Tamil population. The Project will seek to ease ethnic tensions by adopting \npractices that have worked well under NECORD and NEIAP (as described in para. 27). \n \n58.  In the event that disputes arise during project implementation, the relevant parties will be \nencouraged to make use of the established legal system where this is considered accessible \nand  effective.  Where  this  is  not  the  case,  traditional  community-based  nonviolent  conflict \nresolution mechanisms will be used.25 In areas where these do not exist, project management \nwill  select  and  contract  local  NGOs  with  specific  skills  in  conflict  transformation  to  assist \ncommunities in creating such mechanisms. Such contracts could cover several communities at \na time, depending on the need and related economies of scale. The Project will draw on the \nexperience NECORD has gained in this area. \n \n59.  Highly  Stratified  Livelihood  Systems.  The  stratification  of  livelihoods  in  eastern \ncoastal  communities  was  compounded  during  the  conflict  as  the  various  resource  users \nadapted  to  restricted  access  and  degradation  of  the  resource  base.  Significant  differences \npresently exist between resource users in the marine and lagoon systems, between men and \nwomen, and among ethnic groups (Supplementary Appendix G). The Project will address the \n                                                 \n24 The EIRR for the fisheries harbor rehabilitation activities under the recently completed ADB-financed Fisheries \nSector Project was estimated to be in the 20-25% range. \n25 Conflicts among the various ethnic groups are often mediated by local religious or NGO leaders. LTTE leaders play \nthe same role in areas they control. ", " 17\nsocial  stratification  problem  by  identifying  and  supporting  alternative  nontraditional  income \ngeneration activities. At the same time, livelihood support packages for traditional resource-based \nactivities will be carefully tailored to the different needs and capacities of the resource users \n(marine  fishers,  lagoon  fishers,  fisher/farmers,  farmers,  and  farmer/cattle  herders),  and  their \nsustainability will be enhanced through environmental rehabilitation and restoration activities. \nAdvisory services and mentoring support will also be provided to assist project participants in \nfurther  adapting  the  livelihood  interventions  to  their  particular  circumstances  and  capacities. \nProject assistance in this regard will focus particularly on female entrepreneurs.  \n \n60.  Gender. An inequitable division of labor continues to place additional strain on women in \nthe East in fulfilling traditional male tasks, prompting many women to leave the country and \nseek work in the Middle East. In addition, women do not have access to many higher-wage \noccupations, and earn about half of what men earn in occupations in which both participate. \nFurther, unlike in other parts of Sri Lanka, women in the East are only peripherally engaged in \nmarine fishery support activities. Therefore, livelihood improvement interventions supported by \nthe Project, especially those related to microenterprise development, will be geared toward \nwomen. This will be important given the high numbers of households with female heads in the \nproject area. To ensure that this orientation is carried out, criteria for selecting IP-NGOs include \ndemonstrated gender awareness. Moreover, gender issues will be addressed and monitored at \nall levels according to the gender strategy and plan in Appendix 3. \n \n61.  Resettlement  Impacts.  No  resettlement  impacts\u2014either  through  displacement  or \nadverse impacts on incomes\u2014are envisaged, given the Project\u2019s emphasis on providing small-\nscale community infrastructure and support for improved livelihoods. In addition, fisheries harbor \nrehabilitation in Valaichchenai will be limited to the confines of the existing facility to eliminate \nany possible scope for displacement of households.26 A resettlement framework has been \nprepared and agreed upon with the Government in the event any unanticipated resettlement \nissues arise during project implementation (Supplementary Appendix F). \n \n62.  Minority Groups. As noted in para. 15, small groups of coastal indigenous people live in \nscattered communities in the project area. The Project will support specific activities through \nseparate, more holistic interventions to ensure socially and culturally sensitive improvement of \ntheir living conditions. Separate terms of reference were developed for the implementing partner \nNGO that will be engaged to implement the activities directed at coastal indigenous people. An \nindigenous peoples\u2019 plan according to ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples is not necessary in \nview of this direct intervention approach. \n \n63.  Impact  on  Poverty.  The  Project  will  enhance  traditional  livelihoods  in  fishing  and \nagriculture  as  well  as  create  new  economic  opportunities  for  marginalized  groups  in \nnontraditional activities, particularly women and landless laborers. A number of innovative and \nfinancially viable livelihood packages have been identified for possible support under the Project \n(Appendix 12). A cluster concept linking income generation activities of the poor with micro, \nsmall, and medium-scale enterprises within a sector promoting backward/forward linkages will \nbe adopted and technical/mentoring support provided to ensure that the poor do not remain in \nisolated activities that yield low financial returns. By undertaking environmental improvements \nand  strengthening  resource  management  systems,  the  Project  will  also  help  maintain  the \nnatural resource base on which many coastal livelihood activities depend.  \n \n                                                 \n26 An ADB review mission will be fielded following completion of the detailed design of the rehabilitated harbor facility \nto ascertain whether land acquisition would be required or any other resettlement impacts would be generated. ", "18  \nC.  Environmental Impacts \n \n64.  The  Project  is  classified  as  category  B  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003). Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) carried out as part of \nproject  preparation  have  involved  extensive  public  consultation.  In  view  of  the  different \ntypologies and locations of the interventions, five IEEs were prepared comprising development \nactivities in the three SMAs and rehabilitation of the two fisheries harbors. The full range of \ncommunity interventions is examined in the IEEs conducted for the SMAs. While some activities \nmay give rise to adverse but manageable environmental impacts, the Project will also have \nsignificant environmental benefits, including direct protection of sensitive and valuable natural \nresources. A summary environmental analysis is in Appendix 14. Environmental management \nplans, including mitigation measures and environmental monitoring, have been prepared and \nrelevant subprojects will in addition be subject to formal environmental assessment and review \nprocedures (Supplementary Appendixes N and O). \n \nD.  Risk Assessment \n \n65.  The Project will be implemented in a changing political and institutional environment, and \nas such will face considerable political, institutional, social, and security risks. During project \npreparation, to the extent possible, measures to address the risks were incorporated in the \nproject design. The political and security risks are considerably reduced with the current peace-\nbuilding activities. However, until there is a formal resolution between the negotiating parties, \nthese risks will remain. Political and institutional developments will be closely monitored by the \nNEPC and other relevant agencies, to enable project management to anticipate likely changes \nin this regard. \n \n66.  Government  agencies  in  the  North  and  East  have  limited  institutional  capacity.  To \naddress this constraint to effective implementation, the Project will provide strategic staff inputs \ninto  the  local  Government  agencies  to  support  capacity  building  and  implementation  of \nactivities, assist in developing partnerships between Government and NGOs, and strengthen \nprivate sector participation in delivering services. To address the lack of effective enforcement \nof environmental regulations, which could have an adverse impact on project outcomes, the \nProject will work at a number of levels: with communities in terms of awareness raising and local \nresource management subprojects addressing environmental hot spots; through inter-agency \ngroups at the SMA level to establish coordinated planning and resource management systems; \nthrough implementation of subprojects with direct benefits, such as solid waste management; \nand through assistance to improve enforcement of environmental regulations. \n \n67.  The targeted beneficiaries are poor and vulnerable, and there is a risk that they will not \nparticipate in project activities. The project design has addressed this risk by focusing on \ninterventions  that  meet  immediate  needs\u2014provision  of  basic  community  infrastructure  and \nlivelihood  support.  The  interventions  will  be  developed  in  close  consultation  with  the \ncommunities themselves, and will aim to respond to local priorities. IP-NGOs will work with \ncommunities to assist in identifying and preparing these interventions. The sustainability of \nproject activities is also a risk, given the government\u2019s fiscal constraints and the low household \nincomes in the project area. To reduce this risk, the Project will strengthen local community-\nbased organizations and offer training in management practices for project-supported activities. \nTo reduce the fiscal burden on Government, and increase local ownership, the O&M costs of \nthe community infrastructure will be borne by the communities themselves. \n \n ", " 19\nV.  ASSURANCES  \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n68.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The project implementation arrangements reflect the present Government administrative \nstructure in the project area that may change during implementation. The Government \nwill immediately notify ADB of any change in administrative structure and take necessary \nsteps to ensure that the project management arrangements are revised in consultation \nwith ADB to reflect the new administrative structure. \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that all project interventions contribute to peace building \nand community reconciliation. In the event that any intervention is having, or is thought \nto  have  had,  negative  impacts  on  peace  building  and  reconciliation  efforts,  the \nGovernment  agrees  that  ADB  will  have  the  discretion  to  determine  whether  the \nintervention should be continued, redesigned, suspended, or cancelled. \n(iii)  The  Government  will  provide  adequate  counterpart  funding  for  the  Project  and  will \nensure that the lead implementing agency receives its annual budget allocations without \ndelay to enable it to properly discharge its responsibilities under the Project. \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that the lead IA, with the assistance of consulting services, \nwill have come up with long-term O&M procedures and sustainable sources of funds to \noperate and maintain the assets upgraded or constructed under the Project.

Background \n \n1.  Twenty years of conflict has severely affected the livelihood capabilities of households \nand communities in the North and East. The direct effects of the conflict include the loss of \nbreadwinners  and  livelihood  opportunities  due  to  death,  displacement,  physical  injury,  and \ndestruction of physical assets. There has also been a great deal of personal insecurity and \nreduced access to communal and public assets. Capabilities and skills have also been reduced \nby  declining  standards  of  education,  low  school  attendance  rates,  and  lack  of  continuous \nemployment  and  concomitant  skills  development.  The  general  erosion  of  assets  and \ncapabilities, in turn, has undermined people\u2019s capacity to cope with stress and shock, making \nthem overly focused on short-term survival and highly averse to risk taking. \n \n2.  As economic activity diminished due to the above factors, the resulting unemployment \nand  underemployment  further  reduced  household  incomes  in  the  North  and  East. \nUnemployment in the region in 2002 was estimated to exceed 25%\u2014compared with 10% in the \nrest  of  the  country\u2014with  youth  and  new  graduates  among  the  most  seriously  affected. \nWidespread underemployment has also made large numbers of people in the region dependent \non low productivity, low income, and subsistence-oriented activities. Women account for a \ndisproportionately large proportion of the underemployed, particularly those engaged primarily in \nagricultural activities. \n \n3.  Economic activity has slowly picked up since the declaration of a cease-fire in early \n2002. As part of the peace process, some obstacles are gradually being removed, such as the \nborders between government-controlled and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eilam (LTTE)-controlled \nareas. Despite all the legacies of the conflict and prevailing insecurities caused by a deep sense \nof distrust, people are slowly rebuilding their lives and reestablishing social relationships outside \ntheir immediate communities. In response to the cease-fire declaration, more than 270,000 \ninternally displaced persons (IDPs) returned to their areas of origin during 2002. A high level of \nmovement to and within the North and East has continued in the course 2003 as well. However, \nland  mines  and  unexploded  ordnance  still  inhibit  the  movement  of  people  and  access  to \nphysical assets, particularly agricultural land and economic infrastructure. \n \n4.  Restoring village livelihoods in this complex and still fluid situation requires multiple \ninterventions at the community level, and the needs are great. Local roads, particularly category \nC and below, need to be restored. Minor irrigation schemes are in poor condition, with over 30% \nof their tanks requiring rehabilitation. Destruction and loss of animals have significantly reduced \nthe livestock population. Water and sanitation systems were totally or partially destroyed in most \nvillages, and electricity still needs to be provided in many remote rural areas. Most of the \nformerly  surplus  producing  agricultural  areas  have  become  food-deficit  areas, and  farming \nequipment  and  key  infrastructure  have  been  lost.  Coastal  fisheries  have  experienced \nwidespread destruction of productive assets, including boats and gear, and serious damage to \nsupporting infrastructure such as harbors, anchorages, ice plants, and fuel supply depots. ", " \n22  \nAppendix 1 \nB.  Needs Assessment \n \n5.  The recently completed assessment of needs in the conflict-affected areas1 indicates \nthat restoration of livelihoods will require the strengthening of the capacities and assets that \nsupport the basic well-being of the people. The assessment concludes that it will be necessary \nto  provide  an  enabling  and  protective  environment  for  people  to  take  advantage  of  new \nopportunities through a more holistic approach combining the following elements: (i) programs \nthat address immediate, medium-term, and long-term needs in a continuum ultimately linked to \ndevelopment-oriented interventions for poverty reduction; (ii) priority being given to the poorest \nand most vulnerable within the affected communities and resettling populations; (iii) programs \nthat reflect the diversity of natural resources, livelihood systems, ethnicity, conflict impacts, and \ngeographical locations in the region; (iv) participation of communities, particularly of women and \nother  disadvantaged  groups,  at  all  stages;  (v)  empowering  the  affected  communities,  in \nparticular poor people and other vulnerable groups, by promoting institutional development and \ncapacity  building/training  of  participants  in  community-based  organizations  (CBOs), \ncooperatives,  and  other  community  groups;  and  (vi)  promotion  of  peace  building  and \nsustainability. \n \n6.  With nearly 90% of the population in the North and East living in rural areas, livelihood \nrestoration will have to come primarily from reviving and expanding rural economic activities, at \nleast initially. Improving the productivity of crops, fisheries and livestock, and related processing \nindustries will be particularly important. Agriculture and fisheries sector recovery, in turn, will \ninduce a demand-propelled expansion of many other activities, including agro- and fisheries-\nbased services and value addition. Revival of the rural economy through small and medium-\nscale enterprise development, enhanced use of local resources, and an expanded service \nsector  (e.g.,  trading,  transport,  and  tourism)  also  have  considerable  potential  to  improve \nlivelihoods in the North and East. \n \n7.  The current peace process and the ongoing resettlement of IDPs also give opportunities \nfor  expanding  microfinance  (MF)  activities  into  broader  programs  that  link  microfinance \ninstitutions (MFIs) with the needs of both resident and returnee populations. The entry point of \nMF  must  be  at  the  community  level.  Social  mobilization,  savings  promotion,  quality  and \ntimeliness  of  credit  disbursement,  effective  handling  of  recoveries,  income  disclosure,  and \ndelinquency  management  are  the  main  competencies  required  in  expanding  MFIs.  The \ninstitutional development and social mobilization strategies should contribute to the economic \nempowerment of the local people and the smooth functioning of CBOs and other local groups. It \nis  also  necessary  to  combine  the  provision  of  MF  services  with  strengthened  institutional \ndevelopment, staff capacity building, and technical support/mentoring of MF clients. \n \nC.  Lessons Learned and Project Context \n \n8.  Ongoing  interventions  in  the  North  and  the  East  (e.g.,  North  East  Community \nRestoration and Development Program [NECORD] and North East Irrigated Agriculture Project \n[NEIAP]) provide valuable lessons that must be considered in designing projects to help local \ncommunities regain productive lives. In particular, project interventions must adopt a process \napproach to permit flexible adjustment of project design during implementation. This will be \nparticularly important in the present context, given that the security environment remains very \nfluid and that most local people are still traumatized by many years of conflict and the effects of \nliving in insecure surroundings. Other relevant lessons from earlier experiences are (i) the need \nto ensure that a balance is maintained in project activities among ethnic groups; (ii) the need to \n                                                 \n1  ADB, UN, World Bank. 2003. Assessment of Needs in the Conflict Affected Areas. Colombo. ", " \n 23\nAppendix 1\nundertake activities in both government-controlled and LTTE-controlled areas; (iii) the limited \ncapacity of local government institutions to implement projects; and (iv) the critical need to \ncoordinate the large number of externally assisted projects now under implementation in the \nNorth and East.  \n \n9.  The Project will be implemented partly in government-controlled and partly in LTTE-\ncontrolled areas. Although boundary lines between these areas will undoubtedly be the focus of \nfuture discussions as part of the peace negotiations, at the moment they are not actively \ncontested by either side. The future political and security situation in the North and East will \ndepend greatly on the progress of the peace talks. Although the situation now is generally \nstable,  it  is  punctuated  by  frequent  reports  of  relatively  minor  breaches  of  the  cease-fire \nagreement and of intimidation of local citizens and groups not closely aligned with the LTTE. \n \n10.  Key actors who have an influence on the evolving conditions in the conflict-affected \nareas include the LTTE, who wish to ensure that peace will bring, not only rehabilitation to the \nNorth and East, but also significant autonomy in the governance of the region. The LTTE also \nwishes to ensure that it remains the sole recognized representative of the Tamil people. The \nGovernment, which controls about half of the conflict-affected area, sees peace and the ensuing \nstability as an essential ingredient in revitalizing the national economy. However, the attitudes of \ncertain elements within Government and the civil service mitigate against the pursuit of an \nequitable peace settlement. These attitudes are reflected within some opposition parties and \nnationalist political and religious groups in the South, considerably limiting the scope for bold \nGovernment initiatives to advance the peace process. \n \nD.  Prognosis \n \n11.  The general trend over the past 18 months has been a gradual decrease in the overall \nlevel of tension in the country. However, there is a clear sense that the trend could easily be \nreversed. In addition, this general easing of tension does not preclude periodic outbreaks of \nviolence triggered by local issues. These issues tend to be related to competition for local \nresources, for example access to fishing grounds or arable land. Because of the lack of trust \nand effective dispute resolution mechanisms at higher levels, the danger is that these local \ntriggers could cause wider outbreaks of violence through contagion effects. In the present \ncontext, this danger appears to be more of a risk than national or subnational leaders inciting \ntheir followers to violence at the local level. \n \n12.  The most likely scenario over the next few years is that the overall peace will hold \ndespite  periodic  setbacks  in  negotiations  and  outbreaks  of  violence.  However,  the  lack  of \ntransparent, effective, democratic governance according to generally accepted international \nnorms is likely to continue to be a problem for the foreseeable future. Thus, conflict-related \ntensions will continue to constrain Sri Lanka\u2019s development process, particularly in the North \nand East.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "24  \nAppendix 2 \n \n \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE  \nFOR REHABILITATION IN THE NORTH AND EASTa \n \nSource  Amount \n($ million)\n   \nMultilateral \n               World Bank\u2013North East Irrigated Agriculture Project  27.0\n               World Bank\u2013North East Emergency Reconstruction Program  31.0\n               United Nations\u2013Rehabilitation and Reconstruction in North East Province  3.0\n               United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (several programs)  15.1\n               ADB\u2013North East Community Restoration and Development Project  40.0\n               ADB\u2013Secondary Towns and Rural Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation  60.3\nProjectb \nADB\u2014Distance Education Modernization Projectb  45.0\nADB\u2014A9 Rehabilitation under Third Road Improvement  5.0\n \nBilateral \n               European Commission  24.7\n                    (Several  programs  in  rehabilitation,  protection,  capacity  building,  and \ninformation) \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation  16.0\nPro-Poor Economic Advancement and Community Enhancement Projectb \n                     Small-Scale Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Upgrading Project \n               Government of Germany  8.5\n                      (Several programs in rehabilitation, shelter, urban and rural water supply, \nintegrated food security, and training) \n               Government of Australia  4.7\n                       Integrated Water Supply Scheme for Ampara \n               Government of Norway  9.8\n                       (several programs in security, peace building, capacity building, and health) \n               Government of the United Kingdom  21.8\n                        (several programs in security, peace building, capacity building, and health) \n               Government of the Netherlands  5.3\n(several programs in livelihood assistance, education, agriculture, capacity \nbuilding, and environment) \n               Government of Canada  7.6\n(several programs in child welfare, gender, capacity building, and health) \n               Government of Sweden  8.7\n(several program in child welfare, gender, capacity building, and health) \n \na Only major programs are listed.

Background. With the objective of reducing poverty and meeting basic needs in coastal \ncommunities in the three districts of Trincomalee, Batticaloa, and Ampara, the Project seeks to \naddress  women  and  gender-related  concerns  through  selected  interventions.  The  Project \ncomprises five components: (i) sustainable livelihood improvement, (ii) resource management in \nthree  special  management  areas  (SMAs);  (iii)  coastal  resource  planning;  (iv)  fisheries \ndevelopment; and (v) project implementation support. A poverty and social assessment (PSA) \nwas conducted during the project preparatory technical assistance and has been cross-checked \nand updated during loan processing.  \n \n2.  Conflict-Related  Gender  Issues.  During  the  conflict,  the  workload  of  women  has \nincreased  and  role  reversals  have  occurred,  but  patriarchal  values  still  influence  gender \nrelations in society and economy. An inequitable gender division of labor continues to put \nadditional strain on women in fulfilling supposedly male tasks. Due to economic hardships \ncaused by the conflict, many poor women have left the country seeking work in the Middle East. \nNot  only  are  they  prone  to  numerous  abuses  for  using  unlicensed  agencies  or  personal \ncontacts, but they compromise their social status and are blamed for any misfortune that befalls \nthe  family  in  their  absence.    In  the  PSA  focus  group  discussions,  women  mentioned  the \nadditional  workload  originating  from  role  reversal,  a  general  feeling  of  being  exploited,  of \nworking 15-25% longer hours than men (taking unpaid household work into account), increasing \ndomestic violence and incest, and stigmatization for having worked in the Middle East.   \n \n3.  Households with Female Heads. The PSA reports high numbers of households with \nfemale heads (FHHs) in the project area. Overall, FHHs form 16% of the total number of \nhouseholds, with a maximum of 54% for individual Grama Niladhari (GN) divisions in Ampara \ndistrict. Of the 36 GN divisions with 25% or more FHHs, 18 are in Ampara, 11 in Batticaloa, and \n7 in Trincomalee. The emergence of large numbers of FHHs in the project area is directly linked \nto the conflict. War-related death and disappearance of a large number of young men during the \n1990s left a large population of young war widows in the Eastern Province. These women not \nonly suffer trauma, but also fall under the category of widows, a status that carries with it stigma \nowing to prevalent patriarchal attitudes and misconceptions. The breakdown of social control \nand displacement\u2014which have allowed men to abandon their wives without going through a \nlegal divorce, or practice polygamy in selected areas\u2014and high divorce rates have further \ncontributed to the increase in FHHs.      \n \n4.  Wage Discrepancies. The wage disparities between men and women are marked. \nWomen earn SLRs50\u2013100 per day, while men earn SLRs100\u2013200.  Women do not have access \nto many higher wage activities such as masonry and carpentry, even if they have undergone \ntraining. For example, nontraditional job training for women that has been supported by the \nWorld University Services of Canada for the past 10 years is largely ineffective because of \nexisting social barriers. Fortunately, microfinance-based development programs focusing on \nwomen already operate successfully in the project area and are seen as an alternative to female \nwage labor. In the LTTE-controlled areas, structures are more egalitarian and female cadres are \nconsidered equal partners. Sustaining gender equity in a postconflict situation represents a \nchallenge to the Project, which seeks to provide opportunities for women beyond the conflict.  \n \n5.  Women\u2019s Livelihood Activities. Unlike in other parts of Sri Lanka, women in the East \nare only peripherally engaged in marine fishery support activities although in exceptional cases \nthey do mend nets. In lagoon fishing systems, however, they engage in a number of fisheries-\nrelated  activities  like  catching  shrimps,  or  gleaning  for  clams  and  oysters  both  for  home ", "26  \nAppendix 3 \nconsumption and for sale. Mat weaving is another income generating activity. Men seasonally \nmigrate for agricultural work, whereas women remain at home. Therefore, livelihood projects \nand microenterprise development can be enhanced to increase income and social benefits, and \nwill be geared toward women in particular.  \n \n6.  Project Design and Implementation. The Project provides appropriate skills training for \nemployment free from gender bias. All project-related training will include a compulsory module \non  gender  awareness  to  create  a  supportive  environment  for  women.  Service  providers \nspecializing in promoting livelihood and enterprises for women will be recruited. Community \ninfrastructure will be women-friendly, with special provisions for child-care facilities, wherever \nsuitable. Public awareness programs will seek to dispel negative images of widowhood to \nenable widows to gain self-respect and participate in the economy as valued citizens. The \nProject  through  its  selection  criteria  for  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  ensures \nparticipation  by  at  least  one  local  women\u2019s  NGO  as  an  implementing  partner.  The  social \ndevelopment  consultant  to  be  hired  under  the  project  will  have  expertise  in  gender  and \ndevelopment  and  gender  mainstreaming;  conduct  gender  training;  and  advise  the  project \noffices, implementing partner NGOs (IP-NGOs) and NGO consortia on gender-sensitive project \nmanagement. \n  \n7.

A compulsory section for all \nproject reports will include specific gender-related needs in the project area, how the Project has \naddressed these needs by the successes encountered, lessons learned, constraints faced, and \nmeasures adopted to overcome these constraints.  In addition, the external consultant recruited \nfor process and impact monitoring will assess gender issues within the Project and provide \ncomprehensive feedback to the project team, as well as to other stakeholders, on the Project\u2019s \nimpact on women and gender-related issues. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators

", "Appendix 5 33 \nCOMMUNITY-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS: \nSELECTION CRITERIA AND DESIGN FEATURES \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The  core  project  area  is  defined  to  include  the  396  Grama  Niladhari  (GN)  divisions \nbordering  the  coast  or  major  lagoons.  Community-level  project  interventions  for  which  these \nselection criteria apply, will initially focus on 146 vulnerable GN divisions within the project area. In \naddition,  nonvulnerable  GN  divisions  located  in  environmental  hot  spots  within  the  special \nmanagement areas (SMAs) will also receive a set of interventions for community infrastructure, \nnatural resource management and environmental improvement/conservation. Most community-\nlevel  interventions  will  be  facilitated  or  implemented  by  implementing  partner  nongovernment \norganizations  (IP-NGOs).  The  selection criteria  for  IP-NGOs,  GN  divisions,  beneficiaries, and \nproject interventions are outlined in this appendix.  \n \nB.  Criteria for Selecting Implementing Partner NGOs \n \n2.  The  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  landscape  in  the  Eastern  Province  is \nheterogeneous and rapidly changing. Most NGOs provided the local population with services \nthroughout  the  conflict,  and  their  focus  is  slowly  shifting  from  emergency  to  development \ninterventions.1  While  some  NGOs  are  well  established  and  recognized,  others  need \nstrengthening. Except for a few, they generally use uniform methodologies, as they lacked \nexposure to new approaches during the conflict, and concentrated on providing emergency \nassistance. International NGOs also operated throughout the conflict, and national NGOs have \nresumed or started working in the East in recent years. \n \n3.  Many activities under components 1 and 2 will be implemented or facilitated by IP-\nNGOs. Several (2\u20134) experienced local NGOs2 in each of the three districts will be selected as \nIP-NGOs to assist the Project to form and work with user and interest groups at the community \nlevel and strengthen existing community-based organizations (CBOs). The eligibility of IP-NGOs \nwill  be  assessed  jointly  by  the  project  management  team  and  the  district  coordinating \ncommittees (DCCs), in close consultation with the NGO consortia in the three project districts.  \n \nThe selection criteria were developed through an extensive consultation process with the NGOs \nthemselves, who judged the criteria to be transparent and fair. The eligibility criteria for selecting \nIP-NGOs are as follows: \n  \n(i)  readiness to cooperate with the relevant authorities;  \n  (ii)  membership of the district-level NGO consortium;  \n  (iii)  readiness to coordinate with other IP- NGOs;  \n  (iv)  registration under the relevant legislation for at least 3 years;  \n(v)  a district-level or national-level NGO with a governing body and financial autonomy at \ndistrict level; \n(vi)  an office with appropriate staff (at least 30% of staff members being women);  \n                                                 \n1  About 30 district-level NGOs exist in Trincomalee district. In Batticaloa, 45 NGOs belong to the INAYAM \nConsortium of local NGOs. In Ampara district, the older NGO consortium, based in Akkaraipattu and serving the \ncoastal areas, has 20 member organizations. A second district-level network, the Council of Ampara District \nNGOs/Consortium based in Ampara, has a membership of 63 organizations.   \n2  At least one NGO per district should be a local women\u2019s NGO to assure targets in the Project\u2019s gender strategy \nand plan are met. If experience and capacities on gender awareness training permit, this women\u2019s NGO could also \nprovide the gender awareness training or respective modules in other training courses for project partners. To \nqualify as a women\u2019s NGO, 70% of clients and staff including top management should be women. ", "34  Ap pendix 5 \n(vii)  Regular auditing (with at least 2 years of audited accounts) and proper record keeping;  \n(viii)  demonstrated outreach to poor women in coastal areas; \n(ix)  demonstrated outreach to vulnerable groups in coastal areas;  \n(x)  demonstrated gender awareness (at least 50% of groups being women) as evidenced \nby the NGO\u2019s gender-disaggregated monitoring and evaluation system; \n(xi)  demonstrated sensitivity to working with the ethnic group(s) to be targeted in that area;3 \n(xii)  willingness  to  adopt  new  approaches  and  combine  community  development  with \nenvironmentally sound interventions; and \n(xiii)  readiness to increase the number of female office holders to 30% by the Project\u2019s \nmidterm review. \n \n4.  In addition, selection will be based on proposals that outline: \n \n(i)  how project interventions will be implemented, coordinated and facilitated, with special \nattention to the social mobilization strategy to reach vulnerable groups and the mode of \nworking with other NGOs and CBOs within the district; and \n  (ii)  the exit strategy adopted by the IP-NGO to ensure sustainability of project interventions \nwithin communities. \n \n5.  A separate IP-NGO will be selected to implement project interventions in coastal Vedda \ncommunities. In addition to the preceding selection criteria, the following additional criteria will \napply: \n \n  (i)  demonstrated sensitivity in working with small minority groups, who still combining \nhunting and gathering with limited sedentary occupations, and in many instances do not \nwant to be identified as a separate group; and \n(ii)  demonstrated  ability  to  deal  with  prevailing  social  problems  (e.g.  alcoholism)  and \ncommitment to a comprehensive, culturally sensitive livelihood approach. \nC.  Criteria for Selecting GN Divisions  \n   \n6.  The community-level project interventions under component 1 will initially focus on 146 \nvulnerable  GN  divisions.  All  vulnerable  GN  divisions  will  be  entitled  to  receive  support  for \ncommunity infrastructure and livelihood interventions. In addition, vulnerable GN divisions within \nSMAs (84), as well as nonvulnerable GN divisions in designated environmental hot spots (to be \nidentified  during  the  planning  process)  within  SMAs,  will  also  receive  support  for  resource \nmanagement and environmental improvements.  \n \n7.  The vulnerability criteria are based on the data collected as part of the social analysis during \nthe project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) and consisted of the following indicators: (i) \naccess to safe drinking water (households having access to wells or piped water); (ii) access to \nsanitary facilities (number of toilets per household); (iii) percentage of households with female \nheads (FHHs); (iv) number of displacements experienced by a community over the last ten years; \n(v)  number  of  restrictions  affecting  sustainable  livelihoods  within  the  community  (income \ngenerating activities, mobility, procurement and transport of essential items such as food and \nenergy sources); and  (vi) level of indebtedness. \n   \n8.  The six indicators were combined into a vulnerability index. Of 67 coastal GN divisions in \nTrincomalee, 173 in Batticaloa, 156 in Ampara, a total of 146 were ranked as most vulnerable: 35 \n                                                 \n3  The Peace/Conflict Screening Instrument in Section F will be used to assess this sensitivity.  ", "Appendix 5 35 \nin Trincomalee, 88 in Batticaloa, and 23 in Ampara. The 146 GN divisions will be prioritized for \ncommunity  infrastructure and livelihood support during the first 3 years of the Project. Focal \nvillages under the North East Irrigated Agriculture Project and other villages already included in \ncomprehensive village development activities, e.g., under the Integrated Food Security Project, will \nbe excluded. Additional GN divisions will be selected using the following criteria: \n \n(i)  Additional GN divisions will follow the ranking provided in the PPTA. \n(ii)  GN  divisions  with  already  established  North  East  Community  Restoration  and \nDevelopment Project anchor projects will be prioritized to create synergies.  \n(iii)  GN divisions will be selected to ensure that the beneficiary populations reflect the ethnic \ncomposition of the coastal populations within each district.  \n9.  The indigenous coastal Vedda communities concentrated in a number of GN divisions in the \nKoralaipattu North and Koralai Pattu in Batticaloa district, as well as Muttur/Eachilampattai in \nTrincomalee district, will receive specific targeted support. The Vedda communities are all located \nin GN divisions that have been identified as vulnerable. \n \n10.  Nonvulnerable GN divisions located near environmental hot spots within SMAs will also be \nselected to receive assistance in community management of resources, including formation of \ncommunity-based  groups  to  assist  with  enforcement  of  environmental  regulations,  and \nimprovement/conservation of the environment.  \n \nD.  Criteria for Selecting Beneficiaries  \n \n11.  In the vulnerable GN divisions, beneficiaries will be selected to achieve both direct and \nindirect poverty reduction. Thus, beneficiaries will consist of both the poor and those who have \npotential to create employment and link with other beneficiaries within cluster systems. As the \nconflict has created a large number of FHHs and most women are engaged in low-paid wage labor \nor livelihood activities with low returns, women will be a major target group. In multi-ethnic GN \ndivisions, ethnically balanced selection will be instituted. Specifically, the following criteria will \napply: \n \n \n(i)  At least 60% of households are poor, based on a multiple set of indicators covering \neconomic,  social,  vulnerability,  and  empowerment  dimensions\u2014such  as  income, \nhousing and sanitation conditions, education levels of household members, months of \nlow work, number of meals during the dry/low season, and participation in community \norganizations. \n(ii)  At least 50% of beneficiaries are women, with priority to those from FHHs without adult \nmale wage earners. \n(iii)  The proportion of beneficiaries reflects the ethnic composition of the GN division.  \n(iv)  Individual  beneficiaries  and  groups  wishing  to  obtain  credit  for  livelihood \nactivities/enterprises will have to meet the eligibility requirements of NGOs delivering \nmicrofinance under the Project. \n \nE.  Criteria for Selecting Community Infrastructure and Environmental Interventions \n \n12.  Community infrastructure and environmental improvement interventions under components \n1 and 2, respectively, will be undertaken mostly at the community level in one GN division or in a \ngroup  of  several  GN  divisions,  based  on  priorities  identified  by  communities  and  proposals \nsubmitted by communities, local government bodies. Larger scale environmental improvement \ninterventions  will  conform  to  the  SMA  development  plans.  Community  infrastructure  projects ", "36   Appendix 5 \neligible for funding include the construction and rehabilitation of minor roads, culverts, drains, \nsmall-scale  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  simple  solid  waste  disposal  schemes,  and \ncommunity buildings (e.g., multipurpose buildings, day care centers, and playgrounds). Coastal \nfishing communities that meet predetermined selection criteria will be eligible to receive simple \nfisheries support infrastructure including net repair sheds, market/auction halls, fisher rest houses, \nand  simple  cold  storage  facilities.  Environmental  improvements  will  include  solid  waste \nmanagement, introduction of fuel-efficient stoves and alternative energy (such as solar power), \nhabitat restoration, habitat conservation, and implementation of public awareness programs.   \n \n13.  All  community  infrastructure  and  environmental  improvement  interventions  will  go \nthrough an approval process at the divisional secretariat level by the divisional coordinating \ncommittee (DVCC), chaired by the divisional secretary/divisional assistant director of planning, \nand including the divisional environment officer and an NGO representative. The peace/conflict \nscreening instrument for infrastructure and environmental interventions (Table A5.2) will also \nhave to be filled up. If the proposal requires more detailed technical assessment, the DVCC will \nhave the authority to recommend that the project consultant team assist in preparing a more \ndetailed proposal. Depending on the nature and scope of the intervention, clearance may be \nrequired from the relevant approving agency (e.g., the Central Environmental Authority or the \nCoastal Conservation Department). Clearance through the district mine action committee will \nalso be a precondition for initiation of any infrastructure development activity. The clearance will \nbe based on a general mine action assessment and, where required, a technical survey, which \nincludes fencing and marking. Proposed interventions will be ranked according to beneficiary \nimpact indicators, such as investment cost per beneficiary and number of beneficiaries, with \npriority given to those with the greatest or most cost-effective impacts. Any subproject that could \nresult in resettlement impacts will be excluded if it cannot be restructured to avoid such impacts. \n \n14.  Selection criteria for community infrastructure interventions are the following: \n \n \n(i)  The proposed infrastructure should be on public land; where private land is involved, this \nmust be voluntarily transferred at no cost to the Government. \n(ii)  The proposed infrastructure should be on land free from habitation. \n(iii)  The total cost of all community infrastructure projects implemented within a GN division \nshould not exceed $20,000. The overall limit will be raised to $35,000 for GNs eligible to \nreceive fisheries support infrastructure. \n(iv)  The estimated implementation period for specific community infrastructure interventions \nshould not exceed 6 months. \n(v)  The number and cost of approved interventions allocated to each of the major ethnic \ngroups in each district in the target area will roughly reflect the relative proportions of \nthose groups within the overall district population. \n(vi)  A user group should be established at community level and priorities identified through a \nparticipatory needs assessment. \n(vii)  The  proposed  community  infrastructure  should  not  be  located  within  (a)  any \narcheological reserve, ancient or protected monument as defined or declared under the \nAntiquities Ordinance (Chapter 188); (b) any national reserve declared under the Fauna \nand Flora Protection (Amendment) Act No. 49 of 1993; and (c) any mangrove area. \n(viii)  In the case of roads, priority will be given to village link roads that connect to district link \nroads and enhance livelihood activities. \n(ix)  In the case of water supply schemes, only small-scale schemes, including wells, hand \npumps, and rainwater collection tanks will be considered. The water source must be free \nof conflict and villagers must agree to allow access to all potential beneficiaries.

", "Appendix 8 41 \nMICROFINANCE DELIVERY SYSTEM \n \n1.  The livelihood support activities will be financed through a microfinance delivery system \nestablished under the Project. The approach adopted will be consistent with the goals and \nobjectives  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank-financed  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development \nProgram (RFSDP), which seeks to establish a sustainable rural financial system through policy \nadjustments and to improve the operations of rural financial institutions (RFIs). In line with the \napproach adopted under RFSDP, the National Development Trust Fund (NDTF) will serve as \nthe  apex  agency  for  channeling  credit  to  participating  financial  institutions  that  meet \npredetermined eligibility criteria.1 The credit scheme will operate initially through microfinance \nnongovernment organizations (MF-NGOs) that operate at the local level, with expansion to a \nbroader range of RFIs, including cooperative rural banks, MF-fisheries cooperative societies, \nand commercial banks once the delivery system has developed. As such, the strategy is to \nprovide smaller loans for basic livelihood improvement and microenterprise development early \nin the Project, moving up to larger loans and enterprises later on. Currently, the NDTF has 12 \nMF-NGO credit partners in the Eastern Province.  \n \n2.  As the apex agency, the NDTF will manage the credit delivery system and perform \nadministrative functions associated with refinance applications and loan disbursement requests \nby the MF-NGOs. The Project will assist the NDTF with capacity building, including of training \nfor MF-NGOs,2 and will facilitate vulnerable communities\u2019 access to microfinance through group \nformation and community organization. In particular, vulnerable communities will be assisted by \nIP-NGOs in identifying viable livelihood activities in fisheries, agriculture, agroforestry and a \nrange  of  microenterprise  development  opportunities  based  on  nontraditional  activities. \nLivelihood and enterprise development services will also be extended to potential borrowers. \n \n3.  The NDTF will receive funds from the Government at the average weighted deposit rate \n(AWDR) under terms and conditions set out in a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to ADB \nfor onlending to MF-NGOs. The MF-NGOs will add their transaction costs\u2014currently ranging \nfrom 10-16%\u2014to the AWDR and onlend to end borrowers. The MF-NGOs will bear the credit \nrisk and will be free to determine lending rates based on their perception of risks and returns. \nTheir activities at the local level will be closely coordinated with the divisional coordinating \ncommittees and implementing partner NGOs. A service charge of 0.5% will be levied by NDTF, \nwhich will enter into participation agreements with each MF-NGO before any onlending. \n \n4.  I n line with the NDTF\u2019s current practice, the maximum loan amount will be set at SLRs \n30,000 per subborrower for the first loan, SLRs40,000 for the second loan, and SLRs60,000 for \nall subsequent loans, with a maximum term of 36 months. In addition, 50% of the onlending \nsupport will be directed at women.3 These criteria will be reviewed annually and may be revised \nas the credit delivery system develops. \n                                                 \n1 The criteria adopted will be the same as those under the RFSDP. \n2 A training and capacity building program has been developed for MF-NGOs in the project area.  \n3 Over 70% of the clients of microfinance NGOs currently operating in the Eastern Province are women. This is based \non the rationale that women are more responsible clients than men. Men who wish to take out loans are permitted to \nborrow only via their female relatives. As recent studies show, this has resulted in women being solely burdened in \naddition to other household tasks, with the work of reducing poverty and repaying loans taken by their male \nrelatives. Thus the Project aims at gender parity in microfinance so that men take responsibility for their own loans, \nbecome aware of gender equity issues, and share with women the burden of overcoming poverty.

Many of the expected project benefits cannot be readily quantified, particularly those \nfrom  improved  coastal  resource  management  and  planning,  and  social  infrastructure  and \nenvironmental subproject activities. Improved resource management, for example, seeks to \nenhance the sustainability of economic activities and to reduce economic losses by preventing \nor limiting environmentally destructive or inappropriate resource-based activities in the coastal \nbelt. The community infrastructure subprojects seek to meet basic needs and improve living \nstandards of the targeted communities by constructing or rehabilitating small-scale water supply \nand sanitation schemes, minor roads, culverts and drains, solid waste disposal systems, small \ncommunity  buildings,  and  basic  fisheries  infrastructure.  Environmental  improvement  sub-\nprojects  will  include  mangrove  replanting,  solid  waste  management,  and  introduction  of \nalternative energy sources that will also produce benefits that are largely nonquantifiable. \n \n2.  The  livelihood  improvement  and  fisheries  development  interventions  have  more \nquantifiable  benefits.  However,  as  the  former  will  be  determined  largely  by  a  community \ndemand-driven process, it is difficult to predict the actual mix and scale of benefits. Therefore, \nonly the financial incentives for beneficiaries to adopt representative livelihood enterprises and \nthe  impacts  on  household  incomes  were  analyzed.  An  overall  benefit-cost  analysis  of  the \nlivelihood activities has not been attempted. Investments in fisheries development, however, are \namenable to standard economic analysis, the outcome of which is summarized in this appendix. \n \nB.  Livelihood Improvement \n \n3.  Livelihood enterprises to be supported under the sustainable livelihood improvement \ncomponent of the Project will focus on activities in agriculture, fisheries, agroforestry, and \nrelated enterprises servicing and adding value to these subsectors. In addition, a range of non-\ntraditional  livelihood  activities  could  be  supported.  Implementing  partner  nongovernment \norganizations (IP-NGOs) will offer a wide menu of livelihood enterprise models from which \nbeneficiaries  can  choose.  Beneficiary  perceptions  of  the  likely  returns  and  their  ability  to \nmanage and finance the enterprise will be important factors in enterprise selection and in \ndetermining the eventual mix of enterprises supported. Financial models were prepared for a \nrange of indicative enterprises based on market prices in the project area to determine the \nfinancial incentives for beneficiaries to participate and the likely impact on household incomes, \nas well as to provide a basis for estimating financing requirements.1 Key financial indicators for \nthese enterprises are in Table A12. \n \n4.  Annual enterprise financial margins before debt service range from about SLRs12,800 \n($133) for a coconut nursery to SLRs96,900 ($1,000) for a prawn farm. Assuming an average \nhousehold size of 4.5 persons, annual per capita increments range from SLRs2,845 ($29) to \nSLRs21,533 ($222). In addition, returns to labor exceed the current financial opportunity cost of \nlabor in the project area, which ranges from SLRs80 to SLRs120 per day depending on the \nseason and class of labor. As all enterprises are cash-flow positive after debt service (including \nthe first year, which means the financial rates of return are infinite), they should be attractive to \nrisk-averse, low-income households, including those headed by women. \n \n                                                 \n1  More details on the livelihood enterprise models are presented in Supplementary Appendix E, where the marketing \nchannels for enterprise outputs are also discussed.

Equity \ncontributions to be made by beneficiaries will be determined by MF-NGOs as part of their loan ", "48   Appendix 12 \nevaluation procedures. However, preliminary analysis suggests that most livelihood models \nshould be feasible with minimal beneficiary equity.  \n \n6.  The poverty and social analysis carried out as part of project preparation indicates that \nup to half of the households may have incomes at or below Sri Lanka\u2019s lower poverty line of \nabout  SLRs46,000  per  annum.  As  shown  in  the  table,  the  estimated  annual  margins  for \nrepresentative  enterprises  at  full  development  would  in  most  cases  represent  very  large \nadditions to the incomes of poor households. It is projected that the Project\u2019s livelihood support \nactivities will reach at least 40,000 households, comprising nearly 200,000 persons, more than \nhalf of whom are estimated to be at or below the poverty line.  \n \n7.  Failure of markets to absorb the output of proposed enterprises at sustainable prices is a \nsignificant risk, with demand for many of the products likely to be inelastic.  While markets in the \nproject area appear to be very competitive, little or no information is available on which formal \ndemand analysis can be based. General observations and NGO and other agency marketing \nexperiences  in  the  project  area  have  been  summarized  in  the  enterprise  profiles  in \nSupplementary Appendix E. Staff of the livelihood enterprise development services (LEDS) \nproviders will have an important role in minimizing market risk. They will survey prices and \nmarkets periodically and pass this information to the MF-NGOs for use in loan evaluation. The \ncredit specialist will design a simple monitoring system for this purpose. MF-NGOs will be \nencouraged to share information about prices and trends in enterprise profitability. Introducing a \nsystem of evaluating and reporting portfolio performance by the enterprise sector will also help \nidentify market weaknesses and minimize the risk of continued lending to unprofitable ventures. \n \n8.  Limitations in the ability of IP-NGOs to advise beneficiaries on enterprise development \npossibilities will be addressed through support by LEDS providers who will run training courses \nfor  NGO  staff  as  well  as  beneficiaries.2  Providing  orientation  on  market  opportunities  and \nconditions will in fact be one of their main tasks. LEDS providers will also use the public \ninformation system to be established under the Project to disseminate business and market \ninformation throughout the project area. Staff of the MF-NGOs will receive additional training in \nevaluating business proposals through training courses under the Project. \n \nC.  Fisheries Development \n \n1.  Financial Analysis \n \n9.  Project funds will upgrade existing fishing harbor facilities at Cod Bay in Trincomalee \nHarbor and at Valaichchenai. While about 100 vessels use Cod Bay at present, many of the \nfacilities are run-down, resulting in long turnaround times and poor product quality. One cause \nof the poor turnaround time is congestion at the main wharf, which is partly due to inadequate \nmooring facilities and deficiencies in unloading services. Work proposed under the project \nincludes (i) replacing equipment; (ii) constructing new moorings; (iii) constructing crew amenity \nfacilities; (iv) rehabilitating auction and net mending facilities, and (v) providing communications \nequipment.  \n10.  Apart from the main wharf, the facilities at Valaichchenai are largely nonexistent as a \nresult of destruction during the conflict period. Work at this site will include (i) improving the \n                                                 \n2 Agromart for example conducts market surveys and packaging/marketing seminars as part of its introductory \ntraining program. In addition, it organizes trade fairs, entrepreneur competitions, and awareness-raising tours in the \nareas in which it operates, including in the Eastern Province. ", "Appendix 12 49 \nharbor entrance and channel; (ii) rehabilitating existing buildings; (iii) providing equipment; and \n(iv) providing additional facilities including crew amenities and improved access. No vessels use \nthe Valaichchenai wharf at present. Boats based in the area currently moor on the banks near \nthe harbor where unloading and provisioning are done by hand. \n11.  For both harbors, improvements will allow safe mooring year-round for both multiday \n(MDB) and single-day (SDB) boats, safe access to the sea in most conditions, faster refueling \nand provisioning, and more efficient and hygienic fish handling. Vessel productivity is expected \nto improve while the availability of appropriate shore facilities is expected to lead to an increase \nin the number of vessels able to work the lucrative offshore tuna grounds. Catch composition is \nexpected  to  change  as  a  result  and  average  value  to  rise.  Improved  fish  handling  and \nprocessing in particular will raise fish values and reduce postharvest losses, and may facilitate \nthe development of an export-oriented fishing industry along the east coast. \n12.  Both harbors are operated by the Ceylon Fisheries Harbors Corporation (CFHC). The \ncorporation aims to recover sufficient fees from users (fishers and concessionaires) and its own \ncommercial activities at the harbors (provision of fuel and water, for example) to cover at least \nannual  operating  costs.  Funds  for  periodic  maintenance  such  as  dredging,  and  for  new \ninvestments  are  expected  to  come  from  the  government  capital  development  budget.  No \n \ndividends are paid. CHFC proposes to move from the current system of charging fishers on a \nberthing fee basis to a system where a catch-weight based levy is imposed at the port gate. \nThis policy will effectively shift the responsibility for payment of fees from fishers to merchants. \nIn the analysis which follows, the objective of covering operating costs is tested against the \nproposed CFHC levy of SLRs1.5/kg ($15.54/ton) of fish at the port gate.2 \na.  Cod Bay \n \n13.  Investment costs are estimated at $3.1 million, including design and supervision, and \nphysical contingencies of 10%. Although work is expected to take 2-3 years, it will be possible \nfor the port to operate at present levels throughout the construction period. The number of \nvessels using the port is projected to grow from 116 when construction begins to 205 (about the \ncapacity of the existing main wharf) 10 years after the start of construction. Catch rates per \nvessel are projected to remain unchanged with the Project although average trip length is \nexpected to decline as turnaround time is improved, leading to an improvement in fish quality. \n \nThis improvement, together with an increase in the proportion of the catch represented by \nhigher-value species, is projected to lead to an increase of 35% in the average unit value of the \ncatch, compared with the existing situation. These assumptions produce an average fish value \nat wharf gate of $880/ton.  \n14.  User charges were estimated on the basis of SLRs1.5/kg ($15.54/ton) of fish at port \ngate. Under these assumptions, revenue from this source is sufficient to cover operating costs \nfrom year 5 following completion of the work, except in years 10, 15, and 20, when significant \nperiodic maintenance (e.g., dredging) is assumed to be required. Revenue will flow from other \nsources during the life of the investment, including the provision of services and leasing of \nharbor facilities to the private sector for commercial activities.3 The ability of the operation to \ncover routine operating costs is sensitive to changes in assumptions about the growth in vessel \nnumbers. If the number of MDBs was to be only 80% of that proposed, the required levy would \n                                                 \n2 A detailed financial model for each harbor is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n3 The Cod Bay facility generated about SLRs1.5 million in revenue from these other sources during 2001, primarily \nthe provision of water and fuel. Revenue flows from other sources are expected to rise significantly as the number \nof boat landings increases. ", "50   Appendix 12 \nneed to rise to about $19/ton of fish at wharf gate to cover routine operating costs, excluding \nrevenue flows from other sources.  \nb.  Valaichchenai Harbor \n15.  Investment costs are estimated at $2.3 million, including design and supervision, and \nphysical contingencies of 10%. Construction work is expected to take about 2 years following an \ninitial year of consultation, planning, and design. The number of vessels using the port is \nprojected  to  grow  from  none  when  construction  begins    to  155  in  year  5  following \ncommissioning. Catch rates for vessels using the harbor are expected to increase from 20.6 \ntons per annum for a typical MDB presently berthed on the adjacent shoreline to about 25 tons \nper annum when using the harbor. Catch rates for SDBs are projected to rise from 14 tons per \nannum at present to 15.6 tons per annum when using the harbour. Average trip length for MDBs \nis expected to increase from about 7 days at present to 12 days as skippers become more \nconfident that they can enter the port in a wide range of weather conditions. Fish quality will \nimprove as ice supplies and onboard fish handling improve. These latter changes, together with \nan increase in the proportion of the catch represented by higher-value species, is projected to \nlead to an increase of 25% in the average unit value of the catch, compared with the existing \nsituation. These assumptions produce an average value at wharf gate of $760/ton.  \n16.  User charges were estimated on the basis of SLRs1.5/kg ($15.54/ton) of fish at port \ngate. Under these assumptions, revenue is sufficient to meet operating costs from the time the \nport becomes fully operational, except for years 10, 15, and 20 in which significant periodic \nmaintenance is required. The ability of the port business to cover operating costs is relatively \ninsensitive to changes in assumptions about the growth in vessel numbers. If growth in the \nnumber of MDBs was to be only 80% of that proposed, routine annual operating costs could still \nbe covered at the above charge rate. Additional revenue will be derived from commercial \nactivities at the harbor, including leasing the facilities to the private sector. \n2.  Economic Analysis \n17.  Each harbor upgrade proposal was evaluated on the basis of the projected throughput of \nfish  with  the  Project,  less  the  throughput  that  would  be  expected  without  the  Project. \nIncremental throughput is expected to arise largely from an increase in vessel numbers with the \nProject, and a small increase in catch per vessel for some vessels. Any increase in vessel \nnumbers compared with the without-Project situation is regarded as incremental and investment \nand operating costs for these vessels were included in the analysis. The economic worth of \nservices provided by port operators or concessionaires (CFHC supply of fuel, for example) was \nassumed to be covered in full by the annual operating cost estimates for vessels. \n18.  Prices are in constant 2003 values, ex-wharf, adjusted from their financial values by \nimputing various conversion factors, which in turn were estimated using a shadow exchange \nrate factor of 1.1. A domestic price numeraire was used, therefore. A 20-year analysis period \nwas used. For each port, a residual value estimated at 25% of the investment cost was included \nin the resource flow. Fishing vessels were assumed to have no residual value. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 12 51 \na.  Cod Bay \n19.  For the base case assumptions, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated \nat 25.5%. The estimate is sensitive to changes in the fish price\u2014if price were to fall by 10%, the \nEIRR would fall to 20.7%, and a 10% increase produces an EIRR of 30.2%. With a 10% \nincrease in port investment costs, the EIRR would fall to 23.8%, or to 23% if boat investment \ncosts rose concurrently by 10%. \nb.  Valaichchenai \n20.  For the base case assumptions, the EIRR was estimated at 35.4%. This estimate is also \nsensitive to changes in the fish price: if price were to fall by 10%, the EIRR would fall to 29.4%, \nand a 10% increase would produce an EIRR of 41.4%. A 10% increase in port investment costs \n \nwould reduce the EIRR to 33.1%, or to 32.6% if boat investment costs rose concurrently by \n10%. If 20% fewer vessels used the harbor, the EIRR would still be acceptable at about 31%. \n  c.  Fisheries Development Component \n \n21.  Assuming (i) work on Cod Bay begins in year 4 of the Project; (ii) work on Valaichchenai \nbegins  in  year  2  of  the  Project;  and  (iii)  directly  related  training  costs  are  included,  the \nsubcomponent EIRR for the base case assumptions is 30.2%.

The  United  Nations  ranked  Sri  Lanka  84th  among  174  countries  in  the  human \ndevelopment index in 2000. Sri Lanka has made substantial gains in reducing poverty, as \nreflected in its impressive human development indicator, with 0.73 being by far the highest in \nSouth Asia. Poverty in Sri Lanka can be attributed to a much larger extent to income and \nconsumption than to access to basic services. It is a predominantly rural phenomenon with 87% \nof the total poor living in rural areas and distinct regional variations. Overall, about 40% of the \ncountry\u2019s population are either poor or vulnerable to poverty. \n \n2.  Due to the conflict, the North and East have been excluded from official national surveys \nduring the last 17 years. However, data available at the district level and below suggest that the \narea lacks basic services, and has lost productive assets and social capital. At least 60,000 \npeople died, and close to two thirds of households were displaced. Economic activities are \nslowly picking up after the declaration of a cease-fire in early 2002. Reducing conflict-related \npoverty is one of the six pillars of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy.1 In the Poverty \nPartnership Agreement, the Government of Sri Lanka and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nagree that ADB will assist in addressing conflict-related poverty.2   \n \nB.  Livelihoods and Poverty in the Project Area \n \n3.  Methodologies of Poverty and Social Analysis.  In the absence of reliable statistical \ndata on poverty and livelihoods in the North and East and nonavailability of head count data on \nincome poverty for the project area, the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) used \nother proxy data combined with qualitative information. The PPTA included all Grama Niladhari \n(GN) divisions3 that border the coast or major lagoons\u2014396 GN divisions in the project area of \nthe three districts of Trincomalee, Batticaloa, and Ampara, comprising more than 800 villages. \nSix indicators were selected and combined into a vulnerability index.4 Subsequently the GN \ndivisions with the highest prevalence of poverty and dependence on coastal resources for \nlivelihoods were identified. In 82 GN divisions, separate focus group discussions were held for \nmen and women\u2014a total of 1,594 villagers, comprising 806 men and 788 women. Of the 396 \nGN divisions (67 in Trincomalee, 173 in Batticaloa, 156 in Amparai) and taking the 45-50% level \nof the vulnerability index as the cutoff, 146 GN divisions are considered as the most vulnerable \n(Table  A13.1).  They  are  concentrated  in  northern  Trincomalee,  Kinniya/Muthur,  western \nBatticaloa, and southern Ampara. These findings were cross-checked and confirmed during \nloan processing. Due to the cease-fire and the changing socioeconomic situation, the PPTA \nfindings were revalidated and detailed social profiles of the target population, with particular \n                                                 \n1  Government of Sri Lanka. 2002.

Characteristics of Poverty. Poverty in the region is characterized as conflict-related, \nwith displacement,5 loss of assets, physical injuries, death of family members, and military-\ninduced restrictions on the practice of customary livelihoods, such as farming and fishing, \ncontributing to it. Due to the conflict, there has been lack of continuous employment and \nconcomitant skills development. Declining standards of education and  earning a living instead \nof going to school have led to a continuous loss of capabilities and skills especially among the \nyoung.  The  conflict  was  deeply  embedded  in  the  sociopolitical,  economic,  and  cultural \nstructures. It had become everyday reality, with hopelessness and frustration being an integral \npart of life and undermining the capacity to cope with psychological stress, shock, and war-\nrelated trauma. Throughout the conflict, the population concentrated on short-term survival \nrather than on any form of sustainable management of natural resources. The only recent large-\nscale study6 found income levels within the northern and eastern areas, not controlled by the \nLiberation Tigers of Tamil Eilam (LTTE), to be similar to average income levels within the rest of \nthe country. This is largely attributed to the remittances sent by family members from overseas. \nIn coastal communities of the Eastern Province, poverty is highly variable and seasonal, and as \nmuch a result of lack of savings and other practices such as alcoholism, as of degradation of the \nresource base due to a multiplication of users. \n \n5.  Population and Ethnic Composition. The total population of the coastal GN divisions \nis 545,473, more than one third of the total population of the three eastern districts in 396 GN \ndivisions, which comprise more than 800 villages. The average population per GN division is \nabout  1,450.  Major  changes  in  ethnic  composition  have  occurred  at  the  district  level.  In \nTrincomalee district, the proportion of Muslims increased by 10% between 1981 and 1999, while \nthe  proportion  of  Sinhalese  decreased  in  the  two  northernmost  districts  and  increased  in \nAmpara district. The proportion of Tamils increased in Batticaloa and decreased in the two other \ndistricts. Ethnic segregation continues down to the GN divisional level, with communities living \nin  separate  villages  or  sections  of  villages.  Primary  education  being  either  in  Tamil  or  in \nSinhalese effectively supports segregation of children of different communities at an early age. \nThe implication is that project activities in vulnerable coastal communities will address mainly \nthe problems and needs of Tamils and Muslims. \n \n                                                 \n5  In the project area, 264 out of 396 GN divisions reported one or more displacements (defined as a need for a \nsignificant proportion of the population to leave their homes temporarily).

Impact  of  Ethnic  Segregation.  Deep  fractures  have  been  created  and  ethnic \nsegregation  has  led  to  setting  up  separate  municipal  governments,  markets,  or  even  bus \nstands.  Ethnic  tensions  have  been  accentuated.  The  fishing  industry  has  become  highly \nsegregated along ethnic lines. The conflict has resulted in a substantial loss of assets by the \nTamil population, exacerbated by the problems and restrictions faced by Tamil fishers in their \ndealings  with  the  military.  Ethnic  segregation  is  reinforced  in  many  ways.  Business \nestablishments run by, or catering to a specific ethnic group, tend to broadcast their ethnicity by \nsigns either in Sinhala or Tamil, in which relatively few people are fluent in both. There is a high \nincidence of disputes between members of different ethnic groups that can become violent. \nCommunities that once lived together and cooperated in livelihood activities are now segregated \nand mistrust each other.  \n \n7.  Socioeconomic Profiles of Resource Users. The PSA identified the different resource \nusers  in  the  project  area:  (i)  the  fishing  population;  (ii)  fisher-farmers;  (iii)  farmers  and \nbuffalo/cattle herders; and (iv) micro/small entrepreneurs.7 The PSA found the social structure in \nfisheries communities, the tenure system, and ownership of fishing assets to be very complex. \nMany households have multiple sources of livelihoods and boundaries among different types of \nresource users are not clear-cut. Significant differences occur between resource users in the \nmarine and lagoon systems. The socioeconomic status and extent of poverty in marine fishing \ncommunities  depend  on  ownership  of  fishing  assets.  Owners  of  large  sea  canoes  had \ncomparably more secure incomes than laborers and owners of fiberglass boats, despite high \nindebtedness due to capital costs of nets, boats, and engines, and are a relatively well-off \ngroup. Lagoon fisher men and women are among the poorest income groups because of \ngenerally  poor  catch  sizes.  Most  lagoon  households  have  to  complement  their  livelihoods \nthrough migratory wage labor, microbusinesses, or environmentally destructive activities like \nsand mining or cutting of firewood for sale from forests and mangroves. Poverty in fishing \ncommunities is characterized by seasonality of incomes, compounded by an excess of fishing \nlaborers and poor savings habits, with earnings in the high season often becoming repayment \nfor debts incurred in the low season.  High rates of alcoholism exacerbate the situation. Mixed \nforms of farming and fishing were practiced in some areas during the conflict, since fishers faced \n                                                 \n7  The detailed socio-economic profiles are in Supplementary Appendix G. ", "Appendix 13 55 \nfishing restrictions while farmers did not have access to their fields, due to mining, the presence of \narmy camps, and the crossfire between the LTTE and the armed forces. With the peace process \nlifting the restrictions, many people are going back to working as either fishers or farmers, rather \nthan both.  \n \n8.  A Coastal Minority Group. Small groups of coastal Vedda live scattered at the fringes \nof villages within the DS divisions of Eachilampattai/Muthur in Trincomalee district, and Koralai \nPattu North and Koralai Pattu in Batticaloa district. The Government does not consider them as \nan indigenous community,8 no separate statistics exist, and the Vedda themselves in most \ncases would not like to be considered as indigenous people because this leads to stigmatization \nand underscores their marginalization. They practice group-oriented hunting, gathering, and \nfishing. They have retained a number of cultural traditions while being partially incorporated into \nthe market economy. They have experienced many centuries of assimilation and integration \nwith  the  Tamil  communities  among  whom  they  have  resided.  Their  living  conditions  are \nextremely poor compared with those of their neighbors.  They lack access to basic amenities \nand    have  high  numbers  of  school  dropouts.  Child  labor  is  prevalent.  Alcohol  abuse  is \nconsiderable. In the PPTA focus group discussions, they identified lack of housing and basic \ninfrastructure,  insufficient  income,  alcoholism  (among  both  men  and  women),  dependency, \ninability to engage in traditional livelihood activities, and stigmatization as their major problems. \nTheir present carefully balanced and extremely diversified livelihoods will not allow them to benefit \nimmediately from the Project. Separate, more holistic project interventions and the recruitment of \na  nongovernment  organization  with  demonstrated  sensitivity  in  working  with  small  minority \ngroups will be needed to ensure socially and culturally sensitive, and targeted improvement of \ntheir living conditions. The proposed Project will not adversely affect the coastal indigenous \npeople, but will ensure, through particular efforts, better outreach to this group. Thus, the \npreparation of an indigenous people\u2019s plan according to ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples is \nnot necessary. \n \nC.

Introduction \n \n1.  In  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  guidelines,  initial \nenvironmental examinations (IEEs) were prepared as part of project preparation. The IEEs \nassessed the environmental implications of project interventions, identified mitigation measures, \nand developed environmental management plans (EMPs). In view of the different typologies \nand locations of the interventions, five IEEs were prepared to cover project activities in the \nspecial management areas (SMAs) and the rehabilitation of two existing fisheries harbors. The \ntypology  of  community  interventions  planned  outside  the  SMAs  was  examined  within  the \nframework  of  the  IEEs  conducted  for  the  SMAs.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environment \ncategory B under Environmental Considerations in ADB Operations. Project interventions were \nscreened with reference to the Environmental Assessment Guidelines of the Asian Development \nBank (2003). \n \nB.  Description of the Environment \n \n2.  The project area is located in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. Its landscape is relatively flat. \nSoils are mostly sandy regosols and recent beach sands with areas of riverine alluvial. The \ncontinental shelf is about 80 meters wide and more than 60 meters deep. However, some deep \nsubmarine canyons are found close to the shore. The coastline has many fringing coral and \nbarrier reefs and wetlands. There are four major rivers with associated alluvial plains. \n \n3.  The coastal habitats of the project area include estuaries and lagoons, beaches, sand \ndunes, islands, and coral reefs. Large areas of mangrove forest, as well as seagrass beds, \noccur in the intertidal areas along the shores of bays and estuaries, and in lagoons. Marine \ncoastal  ecosystems  support  high  biodiversity  and  are  habitat  for  economically  important \nspecies. Coastal marshes and wetlands are feeding grounds for migratory waterfowl. Sand \ndunes stabilize coastlines, protect interior lands from salty winds and storm waves, and prevent \nsaltwater intrusion. The wetlands have special environmental significance and are threatened by \ninappropriate solid waste management, pollution, blockage of natural water exchange, algal \nblooms, invasion of alien species, and habitat destruction through cutting of mangroves and \nreclamation of lagoon margins. Although under great pressure, mangroves in the project area \nrepresent a substantial share of those in the country. Trincomalee Bay and Batticaloa Lagoon \nare the two most important ecosystems along the eastern coast. Pressure on these areas has \n \nintensified as a consequence of the conflict, exacerbated by lack of effective coastal resources \nmanagement and law enforcement. Within the project area, six sites are formally designated as \nprotected areas, and classified as sanctuaries. \n \n4.  Cultural  landmarks  include  temples,  mosques,  and  16th/17th  century  Dutch  and \nPortuguese forts. Southern Ampara lies on a historic pilgrimage route to Kataragama, a Hindu \nholy site, and also features two important megalithic sites. \n \nC.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts \n \n5.  Sustainable  Livelihood  Improvement  (Component  1).  This  component  will  be \nsupported through a microfinance delivery system consisting of individual loans mostly in the \nrange of $50-100; technical advice; mentoring and capacity building in fisheries, agriculture, \nagroforestry, and a range of nontraditional activities. The IEEs have prescribed the exclusion of ", "58  Ap pendix 14 \nany sites of ecological, archeological, or historic importance; the adoption of integrated pest \nmanagement practices; and the use of certified multiplication and stocking materials. The IEEs \nhave  also proscribed  the  introduction  of  alien  species.  Support  for ecotourism will  include \ncapacity building in delivering services and developing community-managed ecotourism and \nbeach-tourism related microenterprises, all based on prudent and regulated access to natural \nresources, and on culturally acceptable practices. Owing largely to the screening procedures \nthat will be in place; to the small scale, dispersed nature, and low intensity of the enterprises; \nand  to  the  use  of  environmental-friendly  technologies;  no  significant  or  cumulative \nenvironmental impacts are expected. \n \n6.  Community infrastructure will be financed with a limit of $20,000 set per GN division and \n$35,000  for  GN  divisions  eligible  to  receive  fisheries  support  infrastructure.  Proposed \nsubprojects will be subject to a series of stringent selection criteria (Appendix 5) and subject to \nenvironmental  review  procedures  (Supplementary  Appendix  N).  Microprojects  eligible  for \nfunding include the construction and rehabilitation of minor roads, culverts, drains, small-scale \nwater  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  simple  solid  waste  disposal  schemes,  community \nbuildings, net repair sheds, auction halls, rest houses, and cold storage facilities. Environmental \nimplications  have  been  identified  and  addressed  either  by  having  exclusion  criteria  in  the \nselection  process  (Appendix  5)  or  by  recommending  mitigation  measures  supported  by \nappropriate budgetary provisions. The use of asbestos has been proscribed. \n \n7.  Resource Management in Three SMAs (Component 2). This component involves \nactivities whose precise locations are still to be specified, and should therefore be considered as \nprototypes.  Mangrove  rehabilitation,  wetland  management,  and  protection  of  coastal  sand \ndunes  and  other  habitats  of  ecological  and  biological  significance  will  support  habitat \nconservation and rehabilitation. Provided appropriate consultative processes are undertaken \nand no alien species are introduced, these activities will have mainly positive environmental \nimpacts.  Environmental  improvements  will  include  introduction  of  fuel-efficient  stoves  and \nrenewable energy sources, waste recycling, and small-scale solid waste management (SWM). \nEnvironmental implications of SWM have been identified and mitigation measures prescribed. \nThis component will also improve institutional capacity for environmental management and \ncommunity-based conservation, and will lead to improved local-level resource management.  \n \n8.  Coastal Resource Planning (Component 3). This component involves strengthening \nof planning capacities, improving decision making, and establishing functional monitoring and \nregulatory systems, all of which will contribute to improved natural resource management.  \n \n9.  Rehabilitation  of  the  Fisheries  Harbors  (Component  4).  The  IEEs  identified \nenvironmental impacts that could arise from (i) location, in terms of construction of a mooring \njetty  and  new  buildings;  (ii)  design,  in  terms  of  possible  minor  changes  in  the  sediment \nequilibrium due to the construction of the jetty; (iii) implementation, in terms of social impacts \ndue to mobilization of large construction teams, and localized pollution caused by careless \nhandling  of  construction  materials;  and  (iv)  operations,  in  terms  of  pollution  due  to  poor \nmanagement  of  solid  waste  and  effluents.  Mitigation  measures  have  been  prescribed  and \ninclude modeling possible changes to the hydrology and sediment equilibrium to design the \nmooring  jetty;  contractors  adopting  safety  precautions  and  managing  their  work  force \naccordingly;  careful  handling  and  disposal  of  construction  debris  (e.g.,  asbestos);  and \nestablishing facilities and procedures for handling human effluents, solid waste, workshop by-\nproducts and residues resulting from fisheries handling/processing. Civil works will temporarily \nincrease suspended sediments and turbidity in the lagoon, but effects on the overall lagoon \necosystem will be negligible. No significant disruption to traffic and utilities is expected to occur ", "Appendix 14 59 \nduring the construction phase of the harbor rehabilitation. An environmental protection license \nwill be necessary for the ship repair yard/workshop to become operational. \n \nD.  Environmental Management Plans \n \n10.  Within the coastal zone, development activities are subject to the issuance of permits by \nCoastal Conservation Department of the Ministry of Fisheries and Ocean Resources or\u2014in \nselected cases\u2014by the district secretariats. Elsewhere within the project area, undertakings are \nsubject to the provisions of the National Environment (Amendment) Act No. 53 of 2000. Both \ncases require the preparation of environmental analysis at varying levels of detail depending on \nthe environmental implications of the intervention. \n \n11.  Preliminary EMPs have been developed as part of the five initial IEEs. For each sub-\nproject,  more  detailed  instruments  will  be  prepared  at  the  detailed  design  stage  with  the \nassistance of an environmental engineer hired as part of the consultant support team. The \nEMPs will refer to standards set out by the Central Environmental Authority. Environmental \nmonitoring will be conducted by divisional environmental officers supported by the services of \nan accredited laboratory based in Batticaloa. Within SMAs, local communities will play an active \nrole in monitoring resource use and access, as their skills will be enhanced as part of the SMA \nprocess. Project implementing partners will be provided with global positioning systems and \ntrained to precisely locate resources and associated environmental issues. Records will be \ncompiled  and  transmitted  to  the  divisional  coordinating  committee  and  to  the  district \ncoordinating  committee  for  monitoring  purposes.  In  its  progress  reports,  the  North  East \nProvincial Council (NEPC) will include a detailed report on the experience with implementation \nof the EMPs. \n \nE.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n \n12.  A  number  of  consultations  carried  out  during  project  preparation  involved  various \nstakeholders including district-based nongovernment organizations. Public notices in English, \nTamil, and Sinhala were posted in national newspapers and IEEs were uploaded on the web of \nthe NEPC in August 2003. Hard copies of the reports were made available to the public in \nColombo, and at district and provincial levels. Follow-up public hearings were held in the three \nSMAs in September 2003. \n \nF.  Conclusions and Recommendations \n \n13.  Environmental benefits from the Project will result from (i) direct protection of sensitive \nand valuable natural resources; (ii) rehabilitation of altered or damaged habitats; (iii) building \npublic  awareness  of  the  need  for  environmental  protection  and  management;  (iv)  building \ninstitutional capacity for effective environmental planning and management; (v) implementation \nof measures that are designed to minimize pollution and manage waste streams; and (vi) \npromotion of livelihoods that are environmentally friendly. The IEE studies have shown that \nenvironmental  impacts  associated  with  the  proposed  Project  are  manageable  and  can  be \nmitigated. In addition, Supplementary Appendix N assures that national legislation and ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental policies are adhered to and that no work will be undertaken until appropriate \napprovals have been granted. The Project has sufficient contingencies should additional studies \nand mitigation measures be necessary. \n \n14.  The overall finding of the IEEs is that the Project will not cause significant environmental \nproblems and that potential adverse impacts are manageable through proper site location, ", "60   Appendix 14 \ndesign, construction, and management. The Project can therefore be classified under Category \nB:  projects  judged  to  have  some  adverse  environmental  impacts,  but  of  lesser  degree  or \nsignificance than those for category A projects. The IEEs are considered adequate and the \npreparation of a full environment impact assessment is not required.
