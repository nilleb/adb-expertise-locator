Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) cluster on Promoting Action on \nPlastic Pollution from Source to Sea in Asia and the Pacific was approved by the Vice President \non 5 December 2019.1 The TA cluster will help developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) deliver their commitments to reduce marine plastic pollution from \nsource to sea.  It will support selected DMCs to (i) prepare action plans; (ii) reform policy and \nregulations to encourage a circular economy; and (iii) prepare investments in integrated solid \nwaste management (ISWM) and circular economy systems. The TA will also promote and \nfacilitate regional cooperation and knowledge sharing.  \n \n2.   Two subprojects have been defined under the TA cluster: (i) Enhancing Knowledge and \nCreating Enabling Environments for Reducing Marine Plastic Pollution (53068-002) for $1.7 \nmillion, and (ii) Prioritizing and Implementing Actions to Reduce Marine Plastic Pollution for $4 \nmillion. Subproject 1 was approved on 18 December 20192 for $1.7 million.  Additional financing \nfor Subproject 1 of $232,650 from the Global Environment Facility was approved on 20 October \n2020 bringing TA Subproject 1 to $1,932,650. Additional financing of $2,000,000 for the Global \nEnvironment Facility component will be processed in the 3rd quarter of 2021. Additional financing \nfrom non-ADB sources is being sought for additional outputs under TA Subproject 2.   \n \n3.  Implementation of TA Subproject 1 is on schedule.  Under Output 1, scoping in five \ncountries  is  ongoing  to  identify  specific  areas  for  support  on  policy  reform,  institutional \nstrengthening, and for the development and/or implementation of action plans.  Under Output 2, \nspecialist inputs have been provided to six ADB investment projects on ISWM and/or circular \nplastics economy. Under Output 3, preparations for two high-level forums are in progress, a blue \nfinance training has been completed, and a circular plastics economy training is planned for Q1 \n2021. Five knowledge products have been developed and disseminated, including one on \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) responses in waste management. Detailed scoping for further \nknowledge  and  regional  cooperation  activities  are  underway,  including  consultations  with \ngovernments, stakeholders, development partners and regional cooperation programs. \n \nB.  Subproject Outcome \n \n4.  TA Subproject 2 will have the following outcome: DMC action to address marine plastic \npollution enhanced.3 It will directly support TA Cluster outputs 2 and 3, building on Subproject 1 \nactivities. Subproject 2 will have two outputs: (i) plastic pollution reduction investments supported; \nand (ii) knowledge, regional cooperation, and financing for marine plastic pollution solutions \nimproved, described in detail below. Subproject 2 will identify, further develop, and pilot ISWM \nand circular economy systems, technologies and innovations for reducing plastic waste, marine \nplastic pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. It will also build knowledge and capacity of \ngovernment officials, engage local businesses and communities in behavior change campaigns \nand livelihood development opportunities, and facilitate sharing of lessons and solutions between \nkey stakeholders and DMCs.4  \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2019.

Enhancing Knowledge and Creating Enabling Environments for Reducing Marine Plastic Pollution. \nManila. \n3  Defined by the TA. \n4  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "2 \n5.  The TA supports Strategy 2030 Operational Priority 3, the ADB Action Plan for Healthy \nOceans and Sustainable Blue Economies, and several Sustainable Development Goals including \n11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and 14 \n(Life Below Water). Recognizing the essential role of women in developing and implementing \nplastic waste and pollution reduction solutions, the design of Subproject 2 activities, including the \npilot demonstration projects and knowledge activities, will support gender design features to \nfacilitate and ensure women\u2019s participation and access to project benefits.  \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n6.   Output 1: Plastic pollution reduction investments supported. This output contributes \nto Output 2 of the overall TA Cluster. The TA includes two small demonstration projects, one in \nIndonesia and one in Viet Nam. They are designed to review and optimize the implementation of \napproaches to reduce marine plastic pollution, through improving waste management (with a \nfocus on increasing the quality of recycling and value of plastics) and transitioning to a circular \nplastics economy. It is proposed that each demonstration project will target an area with about \n3,000 households. Activities could include (i) source segregation of wet, dry and recyclable \nmaterials (including mixed plastics of both low and high quality) at the household level; (ii) \ncollection systems to ensure material quality and prevent leakage to the environment; (iii) \ncentralized waste management at material recovery facilities; (iv) digital technologies promoting \ncollection  efficiency  and  enabling  resource  traceability;  and  (v)  community  and  business \nengagement, behavior change campaigns, and capacity development activities such as design-\nthinking workshops to stimulate new circular business models combined with business/livelihood \nsupport programs, targeting vulnerable members of the community. Partnerships will be pursued \nwith reprocessing and secondary recycling partners to support the new resource management \nsystem; with the private sector and development partners to enhance the scope and scale of pilot \nactivities; and, with local business organizations, microenterprises/co-operatives, civil society \norganizations (CSOs), informal waste sector representatives, and/or women\u2019s organizations to \nenhance the sustainability of interventions.  \n \n7.  To maximize the benefits of the pilot demonstration activities, similar in-country initiatives \nand global best practices will be reviewed and lessons will be incorporated to the design. The \ndemonstration project site locations will be selected in consultation with governments and the \nSouth East Asia Regional Department and guided by selection criteria.5 The scope and design of \nthe pilots will be tailored to the local context and needs of the community. Learnings will be \nreported  throughout  the  pilots  to  benefit  other  TA  activities.  At  the  end  of  the  project,  a \ncomprehensive report will be produced, which will include findings from the two pilots and \nrecommended strategies for replication and scaling-up.  \n \n8.  The TA will also support the preparation of at least two project components that utilize \ndigital technology to reduce marine plastic pollution, either through circular plastics economy \n \n5  The demonstration sites will be selected using the following criteria: clear support and engagement from government \n(local, provincial, national), including in kind contributions; local administrative area closely matching the target scale \nof about 3,000 households; supportive community and presence of local community organizations; accessibility and \nvisibility for purposes of demonstration and education during knowledge sharing activities; low income demographic; \nlocation immediately bordering the coast or a water course flowing to the sea; presence of target sectors for plastic \nwaste reduction (e.g. fisheries or tourism); small vehicle access within the demonstration area and 14 tonne vehicle \naccess to the perimeter of the demonstration area and MRF location; 400 m2 area of available land immediately \nadjacent to the trial area for MRF construction; waste water treatment plant within 50 km to allow the safe disposal \nof leachate and washing water from MRF operations; and presence of environmental projects and initiatives in the \nwider area allowing the project build upon activities of previous and existing projects.  \n ", "3 \n \napproaches or ISWM with a focus on Reduce, Reuse, Recycle (3R). Technologies may be \nidentified through the TA\u2019s technology and innovation study (described below) or through the TA \ncollaborating with innovation challenges led by partners, such as the World Wide Fund for Nature. \nPreference will be given to innovations in Asia and the Pacific. Digital technologies could include \nthose that support reverse logistics services, reuse and refilling models for fast-moving consumer \ngoods, behavior change, waste tracking, or collection services. Projects supported will be on a \ndemand-driven basis, linked to ADB country partnership strategy or county operations business \nplan processes, and confirmed during the inception phase of the project.  \n \n9.   Output  2:  Knowledge,  regional  cooperation,  and  financing  for  marine  plastic \npollution solutions improved. This output contributes to Output 3 of the TA Cluster. The TA will \nsupport  knowledge  generation,  knowledge  sharing  and  capacity  development  at  the  local, \nnational  and  regional  levels.  Target  audiences  include  government  officials  and  other \nstakeholders such as key industries, businesses, and CSOs. These knowledge activities will \ninclude: \n(i)  A regional research study and related knowledge products on technology solutions \nfor addressing the plastic pollution problem in Asia and the Pacific. The research \nwill assess existing proven technologies and innovative emerging technologies, \nwith a focus on digital technologies that support plastic waste reduction and high-\nquality recycling;  \n(ii)  The inaugural ADB Healthy Oceans Technology and Innovation Forum, ADB\u2019s \nflagship ocean event, which aims to share technologies, innovation and business \nsolutions with DMCs to generate awareness and interest for further investments in \nocean health. The forum will include technology and innovation that supports the \nsustainable implementation of ADB\u2019s Action Plan for Health Oceans, which will \nhave a focus on plastics and circular economy approaches amongst others. The \nforum  also  presents  opportunities  for  high-level  dialogue  among  countries;  \nknowledge  sharing  on  best  practices  by  partner  governments  such  as  the \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea and Government of Japan; engaging ADB \noperations;  and facilitating  connections  between  DMC  and  governments,  the \nprivate sector and leading technology providers and institutes;  \n(iii)  At least three additional regional and subregional cross-learning, knowledge-\nsharing and capacity building activities on plastic waste management and circular \neconomy. The activities will  focus on showcasing the demonstration projects and \nsuccessful initiatives from the region; approaches that have led to tangible benefits \nfor communities, including green jobs and livelihoods; and technology solutions, \nincluding digital technologies; and financing solutions for a new circular plastics \neconomy; and, \n(iv)  At least one additional high-level awareness-raising event on oceans health and \ncircular  plastics  economy.  There  is  opportunity  to  collaborate  with  regional \ncooperation  programs  such  as  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Economic \nCooperation  Program,  the  Indonesia\u2013Malaysia-Thailand  Growth  Triangle,  the \nBrunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area, \nand relevant Pacific programs. \n \n10.   Output 2 activities will be implemented in collaboration with partners with complementary \nexpertise and similar objectives. The project team has identified and communicated with potential \npartners in the private sector, CSOs, women\u2019s groups, international organizations, and bilateral \ndonor programs. These partners may be engaged as knowledge partners (e.g., peer-review of \nknowledge materials, co-organizers of activities, resource speakers in events) or as beneficiaries \nof the activities (e.g., participants in events). Events, such as capacity-building workshops and \n ", "4 \nforums, will promote representation and participation of women, youth, community leaders, and \nvulnerable groups. \n \nD.  Subproject Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA subproject is estimated to cost $2,000,000, of which (i) $1,500,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB; and (ii) \n$500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \nE.  Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.   ADB will administer TA Subproject 2.
