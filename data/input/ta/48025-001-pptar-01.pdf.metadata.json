Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement \n \n3.  The total cost of the TA amounts to $445,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). 6 The Government through \nUTY  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  PIU  staff,  office  space  and  supplies, \nsecretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. The value of the government contribution \nis estimated to account for 10% of the total TA cost. The detailed cost estimate is in Table A3.2. \n \n \n \n                                                \n6  Project preparatory technical assistance will be financed from proceeds of the earlier approved TA 8706 for \nUzbekistan: CAREC Corridors 2 and 3 (Marakand-Bukhara) Railway Electrification Project, subject to approval of a \nmajor change in scope.
