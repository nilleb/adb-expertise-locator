A  summary  IEE  for  one  of  the  four  sample \nsubprojects was circulated to the Board on 19 August 1998. \n   \nRationale  Efficient transport is essential for  achieving the higher levels of \neconomic  growth  needed  for  sustainable  poverty  reduction  in \nIndia. It contributes to expansion of production and employment \nopportunities that can raise poor people\u2019s  incomes. To improve \nthe performance of railways, one of India\u2019s main transport modes, \nthe  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR)  has  decided  to  carry  out  a \nprogram of institutional and policy reforms of IR. The first phase \nof reforms for 2002\u201305 will develop the commercial orientation of \nIR, including introducing an accounting  separation of IR\u2019s main \nlines of business and separately identifying the main services \nwithin these lines of business as profit/cost centers, and a first \nstage  of  restructuring  of  production  units  and  other  noncore \nactivities. Social responsibilities will be delineated to be funded \nseparately. Internal business processes will be reengineered and \ncustomer  orientation  improved.  Private  sector  participation  in \nrailway services will be increased. IR will steadily rationalize tariffs \nand continue to rightsize its staffing. Its investment planning and \nselection  procedures  will  be  strengthened  to  concentrate  \ninvestment on activities needed to improve the performance of its \ncore businesses. These improvements will provide the basis for \nfurther reforms to be completed during  2006\u20132010. Alongside \nreform, IR also requires considerable investment to overcome \ncapacity bottlenecks on its major freight routes, including those \nbetween the four metropolitan cities of Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, \nand Mumbai. \n   \nObjective and Scope  The objective of the Project is to improve the performance of the \nrailway sector by supporting (i) implementation of a program of \ninstitutional  and  policy  reforms  to  improve  IR\u2019s  commercial \norientation, and (ii) expansion of core businesses by financing \npriority investments to overcome railway capacity bottlenecks and \n   ", "iv \nimprove operational efficiency and safety. The Project will also \ncontribute to organizational efficiency by promoting outsourcing, \naward  of  concessions,  and  use  of  consolidated  contracts  for \nexecution  of  railway  investment  projects.  It  will  support  wide-\nranging  improvements  in  the  overall  governance  of  IR  by \nstrengthening accountability, transparency, and management. \n \nThe  Project  will  establish  a  framework  for  linking  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  lending  for  railways  to  the \naccomplishment of successive milestones in the reform program, \nand provide support for implementation of key reforms. \n \nUsing  ADB\u2019s  sector  lending  modality,  the  Project  will  finance \npriority investments in capacity augmentation recommended by \nthe Long-Range Decision-Support System of MOR to overcome \nfreight  bottlenecks  and  improve  safety.  It  will  also  support \nconstruction of new lines expected to have high economic and \nfinancial returns. Four sample subprojects have been prepared in \ndetail for capacity augmentation and new line construction in the \nstates of Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, and Chhattisgarh. MOR will \nprepare  additional  subprojects  during  project  implementation \naccording to subproject selection and approval procedures that \nhave been agreed between MOR and ADB. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $579.2 million \nequivalent. The foreign exchange cost is $340.8 million, and the \nlocal currency cost is $238.4 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nSource  % \nExchange  Currency   Cost \n  ADB  308.2  5.4  313.6  54 \n  Government  32.6  233.0  265.6  46 \n    Total  340.8  238.4  579.2  100 \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The proposed ADB loan is $313.6 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources with a repayment period of 25 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, with interest determined in \naccordance with  ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. The loan \nwill carry a front-end fee of 1% and a commitment  charge of \n0.75% per annum. The Borrower will relend the proceeds of the \nADB loan to MOR in local currency. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2008 \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Railways \n   \nImplementation  The reform component will be implemented under the leadership \nArrangements  of the chairperson, Railways Board, supported by the Planning \nDirectorate. The investment component will be implemented by a \nspecial purpose vehicle established under the Companies Act \nand wholly owned by the Government. \n ", "                                                                   v \nand wholly owned by the Government. \n   \nProcurement  All civil works contract packages will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement following international and \nlocal competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n   \nConsulting Services  International and domestic consultants will be required to support \nthe  reform  and  investment  components  of  the  Project.  The \nconsultants will be engaged using ADB\u2019s quality and cost-based \nselection procedures and according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \non the engagement of domestic consultants. \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2007 \nCompletion Date \n   \nProject Benefits and  Implementation  of  institutional  and  policy  reforms  of  IR  will \nBeneficiaries  improve the overall efficiency of the transport sector, contributing \nto economic growth, employment creation, and income growth, \nand leading to poverty reduction. These benefits will be widely \ndisseminated across the country. The main quantifiable benefits \nof the investment component consist of (i) railway operating cost \nsavings;  (ii) savings  in  rolling  stock  arising  from  improved \nutilization;  (iii) reduced  working  capital  expenses  due  to  time \nsavings; and (iv) additional production of minerals made possible \nby improved railway services. The economic internal rates of \nreturn of the four sample investment subprojects all exceed 12%. \nThe investment component will contribute to poverty reduction by \n(i) contributing  to  national  economic  growth  that  will  increase \nemployment  and  income-earning  opportunities  for  the  poor; \n(ii) facilitating  employment  creation  and  income-earning \nopportunities for poor people living in areas previously without \nefficient  transport  links;  and  (iii) providing  employment \nopportunities for poor people during construction. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  In  conjunction  with  the  Project,  technical  assistance  (TA)  is \nproposed to provide management consulting services to IR. The \ntotal cost of the TA is estimated to be $590,000, of which ADB will \nfinance  $500,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding \nprogram. The consultants will be engaged using ADB\u2019s quality \nand  cost-based  selection  procedures  and  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. \nThe Executing Agency for the TA will be MOR. \n \n \n \n   ", "                                                                   vii \n   ", "                                                                   1 \nI.

For the past 150 years, railways have played an important role in the social, political, and \neconomic life of India. For most of that time railways were the leading mode of transport, in many \nplaces the only available mode. In such a large continental country, railways have offered unique \nadvantages for transporting freight and passengers over long distances.  \n \n3.  IR is a departmental enterprise, wholly owned by the Government. It is the largest single \norganization in India, with a capital investment of about Rs479 billion ($10 billion) and a total \nstaffing of 1.545 million. IR operates one of the world\u2019s largest railway networks.2 Its size, and its \nmode of operation as a government department, present special challenges for the management of \nrailways as a commercial enterprise. They also add to the difficulty of responding to both short- \nand long-term changes in transport market conditions. The organization structure  of  IR  is  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n4.  In the past two decades, IR\u2019s share of the transport market has fallen, due to increasing \ncompetition from road transport.3 Its financial performance deteriorated and it did not generate \nenough  resources  to  finance  the  necessary  investments  in  asset  replacement  and  capacity \nexpansion. The existing model of railway provision needs to be modified to restore IR\u2019s financial \nposition and enable the railways to achieve their potential contribution to poverty reduction through \neconomic growth. This will require IR to strengthen its commercial orientation and concentrate on \nservices it can provide at a comparative advantage, and reduce its involvement in services better \nprovided by others. Analysis of the railway sector is in Appendix 3.  \n \n2.  Traffic \n5.  Along with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the United States (US), India is one \nof the few countries in the world with annual railway traffic in excess of 500 billion converted ton-\nkilometers (ctkm). The passenger share of railway traffic in India is high compared with other \ncountries with large railway operations. In FY2001, passenger-kilometers (pkm) represented 59% \nof IR\u2019s total ctkm, compared with 24% in the PRC and 1% in the US.4  \n \n                                                 \n1  The term \u201cIndian Railways\u201d refers to the 15 zonal railways and 59 subsidiary divisions under the overall responsibility \nof the Ministry of Railways through the Railways Board. \n2  The IR network has more than 63,000 route km. There are 6,853 stations, 7,566 locomotives, and more than 260,000 \nwagons and coaches. These are maintained in 225 locomotive sheds, 401 passenger car and freight wagon repair \ndepots, and 49 workshops. IR also has six manufacturing units.  \n3  In view of existing and planned investments in highway improvement, this competition is set to intensify. \n4  1 tkm equals 1 pkm equals 1ctkm. \n   ", "2 \n6.  Although railway freight and passenger traffic have followed a long-term trend of steady \ngrowth, the growth of traffic on roads has been consistently higher. In FY1980\u20132001, the average \nannual growth in rail freight ton-kilometers (tkm) was 3.4% compared with 10.2% for road, and rail \npkm grew at 4% compared with 9.6% for road. In FY1980, railways accounted for two thirds of \nfreight and one third of passenger traffic. By FY2001, this had fallen to less than one third of freight \nand only 13% of passenger traffic.  \n \n7.  IR\u2019s freight traffic consists mainly of minerals (especially coal) and other bulk commodities. \nIn FY2001, coal accounted for 43% of freight traffic (tkm). Six other bulk commodities accounted \nfor a further 44%. The majority of passenger traffic (pkm) is in low-fare categories. In FY2001, \nsecond class non-suburban services (ordinary and mail/express) accounted for 75% of passenger \ntraffic, with 19% for suburban (all classes), and 6% for upper class services.  \n \n3.  Operations \n8.  In view of the high investment cost of railway infrastructure, the intensity of track utilization \nin terms of ctkm per route km is an important dimension of productivity. IR\u2019s track utilization \ncompares well against the railways of Japan and the US, although lower than the PRC. Coach and \nwagon productivity are indicators of efficiency of utilization of a railway\u2019s assets. IR\u2019s coach \nproductivity compares favorably with developed countries and the PRC. Its wagon productivity is \nlower than that of Japan and the PRC, although much higher than that of Bangladesh and Thailand \n(Appendix 3).  \n \n9.  A significant difference compared with developed countries is the very high level of staffing \nthat IR employs to operate its railways. As a result, IR\u2019s staff productivity is much lower than that of \nrailways in developed countries, although roughly similar to  that of  the PRC and Thailand, and \nmuch higher than that of Bangladesh.5 This partly reflects the lower salary levels in India and other \ndeveloping countries, which favor more labor-intensive approaches to production. It is also an \nindication that, in the past, IR\u2019s staffing was allowed to grow too large. At about half of gross traffic \nrevenues, the present level of staff costs is  a structural impediment to improving IR\u2019s financial \nperformance and generating resources for investment. To address this problem, the Ministry of \nRailways (MOR) has a policy of reducing staffing at a net rate of 2% per annum.6 As a result, IR\u2019s \ntotal staffing was reduced from 1.797 million in 1991 to 1.545 million in 2001. Through continued \nimplementation of this policy, MOR plans to steadily reduce staffing to 1.18 million by 2010.  \n \n10.  One of IR\u2019s most serious operational problems concerns the low average speeds on the \nnetwork, and lack of improvement in speeds over time. Since FY1961, the average speed of diesel \nfreight trains has remained at around 22 kilometers per hour (kph). The average speed for electric \ntraction has remained at around 24 kph. One of the main reasons for low speeds is that many of \nthe  busiest  routes  have  reached  their  designed  traffic-handling  capacity  and  have  become \ncongested. This applies in particular to the routes of the Golden Quadrilateral and its \u201cdiagonals\u201d \nthat account for two thirds of IR\u2019s freight traffic.7  \n \n11.  A further operational problem has been the high and rising level of traffic accidents. From \nFY1997 to FY2001, the total number of train accidents per million train km rose from 0.57 to 0.64. \n                                                 \n5  This section draws on a comparison of operating performance indicators for a group of six countries comprising \n(i) developing countries with extensive railway networks (India and the PRC); (ii) developed countries with extensive \nrailway networks (Japan and the US); and (iii) developing countries with smaller railway networks (Bangladesh and \nThailand). \n6  3 percent attrition less 1% new recruitment. \n7  The Golden Quadrilateral refers to the Delhi-Kolkata, Kolkata-Chennai, Chennai-Mumbai, and Mumbai-Delhi routes. \nThe diagonals refer to the Delhi-Chennai and Kolkata-Mumbai routes. \n ", "                                                                   3 \nThe majority of accidents were derailments. From FY1997 to FY2001, the  annual number of \nderailments increased from 282 to 344. Other accident types included collisions, grade crossing \n(level crossing)  accidents, and fires in trains. MOR statistics indicate that human error was the \ncause of 86% of total train accidents in FY2001, and 7% were due to equipment failure. One of the \ncontributing factors leading to increasing accidents is that many of the assets, such as track and \nbridges, are reaching the end of their economic life and need to be replaced. Due to weaknesses \nin IR\u2019s financial performance, including inadequate provision for depreciation, there is a backlog in \nasset replacement. In the absence of replacement, assets require greater maintenance, but the \npresent high levels of track utilization make it difficult to take facilities out of service to perform \nmaintenance.  In  2000,  the  Railway  Safety  Review  Committee  recommended  investments  of \nRs150 billion to improve railway safety. From October 2001, IR imposed a surcharge to improve \nrailway safety. The surcharge is expected to raise Rs50 billion over 6 years. MOR is also seeking \nexternal assistance to provide additional financing of railway safety measures. \n \n4.  Tariffs \n12.  Since railways have been required to meet social as well as economic objectives, social \nand political factors have often outweighed commercial considerations in the process of tariff \nsetting. As a result, there has been sustained underpricing of passenger services. In an effort to \ncross-subsidize loss-incurring passenger services, there has been sustained overpricing of freight. \nCompared with other countries, the ratio of India\u2019s average passenger fares per pkm to average \nfreight tariffs per tkm is very low. The ratio of 0.3 for India compares with 1.2 in the PRC, 2.2 in \nJapan, 0.7 in Thailand, and 0.5 in Bangladesh.  \n \n13.  Sustained tariff imbalance is one of the underlying causes of the operational and financial \nproblems faced by IR. Passenger services now account for nearly two thirds of railway services, \nbut contribute only one third of revenue. In FY2001, total passenger revenues were Rs105 billion, \ncompared with freight earnings of Rs230 billion. MOR estimates that passenger services made a \nloss of Rs49 billion that year. \n \n14.  Overpricing  of  freight  has  reduced  IR\u2019s  competitiveness  in  its  main  revenue-earning \nmarkets. This has caused traffic to divert to road and has reduced IR\u2019s net earnings. Underpricing \nof passenger services has encouraged a high volume of uneconomic passenger services. These \nnot only incur losses but also take up scarce capacity on the main freight routes, contributing to \ncongestion that further reduces IR\u2019s competitiveness in freight markets.  \n \n5.  Noncore Activities \n15.  IR has sought to be self-sufficient by operating its own capacity for manufacturing rolling \nstock  and  other  railway  equipment,  and  for  providing  supporting  services.  It  has  six  large \nmanufacturing units producing electric and diesel locomotives, passenger cars, freight wagons, \nwheels and axles, and components.8 It also runs residential colonies, catering and other on-board \nservices, security services, hotels, sanitation services, printing presses, medical facilities, schools \nand colleges, and research facilities. While noncore activities have made an important contribution \nto the railway sector in the past, by being run as part of a government department and insulated \nfrom competition they have had only limited incentive to be efficient, and have not kept up with \ntechnology advances. They have been ill-equipped to provide services, such as catering, that \nrequire a high degree of customer orientation. The existence of al rge noncore activities also \nincreases the complexity of managing IR and distracts the focus of management from the core \n                                                 \n8  As an indication of the scale of these activities, in FY2001 IR\u2019s manufacturing units produced 120 electric locomotives, \n105 diesel locomotives, 2,190 passenger cars, nearly 2,000 wagons, and more than 30,000 wheel sets.  \n   ", "4 \nbusiness of operating railways. There is a need to reexamine the role, efficiency, and effectiveness \nof IR\u2019s noncore activities, with a view to separating remaining noncore activities from IR\u2019s core \nactivities so that the noncore activities are operated according to commercial principles, and that \ninputs are procured for IR\u2019s operations on a competitive basis. \n \n6.  Financial Performance \n16.  Over the period FY1998\u20132001, IR\u2019s financial performance deteriorated (para. 65), and in \nFY2001 it had to  defer part of the  payment of  a dividend to  the Government. These financial \nproblems helped draw attention to the need for reform. The Government has made it clear that IR \nshould not rely on budgetary sources of financing, and has encouraged it to proceed with reforms \nto improve its performance and enable it to attract financing from multilateral sources and the \ndomestic financial markets.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Challenges \n17.  The weaknesses in railway sector performance are manifested in declining market share, \nadverse operating indicators, and reduced revenue generation. Their underlying causes are to be \nfound  in  the  policy,  institutional,  and  organizational  arrangements  for  railways,  which  are \nthemselves based on the idea of running railways as a social and economic arm of government \nrather than as a business. A cause-effect tree analysis is in Appendix 4.  \n \n18.  Although the present railway sector arrangements served India well for many years, they \nare no longer adequate for railways in a transport market characterized by increasing modal \ncompetition and customer choice. The future performance of the railway sector will depend on how \neffectively it can adapt its services to its changing market position. The fundamental challenges for \nIR are therefore to establish a commercial orientation, with a view to (i) arresting the decline in its \nshare of its main markets, (ii) improving the profitability of railways operations, and (iii) generating \nsufficient income to finance necessary investments in asset replacement, improvement, and safety. \nThis will involve IR (i) running railways services along business lines, including expanding activities \nthat offer favorable commercial returns and reducing activities that do not; (ii) concentrating on the \ncore business of operating railway services; (iii) progressively hiving off noncore businesses, and \nmaking increased use of outsourcing on the basis of competition; (iv) adopting objective systems \nfor selecting investments on the basis of expected financial and economic returns, with a view to \nimproving operational performance and capacity in its major markets (notably on freight services in \nthe Golden Quadrilateral); and (v) rationalizing tariffs to correct for past overpricing of freight rates \nand  underpricing  of  passenger  fares,  and  to  adapt  individual  freight  and  passenger  tariff  \ncategories to improve competitiveness and increase returns. To enable IR to introduce these \nchanges the Government will have to relieve IR of the  financial burden of continuing to operate \nloss-incurring services that are required for social reasons. For this purpose, the Government will \nneed to establish a mechanism for compensating IR for losses on these services.  \n \n2.  External Assistance \n19.  The railway sector has received considerable external support over an extended period. \nHistorically, the World Bank was the leading source of external assistance, having provided more \nthan $2.1 billion of loans for 18 projects of IR between 1959 and 1988. From 1988 onward, the \nWorld Bank  stopped providing support for IR, but in 2002 it approved a project to develop a \nseparate urban railway venture serving Mumbai. ADB provided loans to assist IR in 1987 and 1991 \nwith a combined value of $415 million. The leading bilateral funding agencies have been Germany \n ", "                                                                   5 \nand Japan, which financed six projects each since the early 1980s. Germany\u2019s support was mainly \nfor supply of equipment to IR and strengthening its production units. Japan\u2019s support was mainly \nfor urban railway systems, most recently for construction of the Delhi metro system. Other bilateral \nfunding agencies have included France, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. In overall \nterms, until the early 1990s external assistance to IR financed a variety of railway investments with \nvarying success. After that time, external assistance was reduced as funding agencies became \nconcerned that investments would not achieve their potential impacts until MOR implemented \ninstitutional and policy reforms to address key obstacles to sector performance. A summary of past \nexternal assistance to the railway sector is in Appendix 5.  \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s  two  previous  railway  projects  financed  investments  in  additional  capacity.  The \nRailways Project9 experienced initial delays of several years when the Government decided to \nrefine  parts  of  the  project  scope.  Implementation  then  proceeded  smoothly,  except  that  a \ntechnology transfer component took longer than originally expected.10 In the Second Railways \nProject,11  each  of  the  components  met  their  objectives  and  were  economically  viable,  but \nimplementation of one component took several years longer than scheduled. The delays were \nmainly  due  to  weaknesses  in  project  management  and  MOR\u2019s  cumbersome  procurement \nprocedures. MOR also did not fully comply with the financial covenants and progress reporting \nrequirements.12  \n \n21.  The overall lesson arising from external assistance to the railway sector is that substantive \nreforms are needed  to improve sector performance and ensure that investments achieve their \npotential returns. This is addressed in the proposed Project by making reform its main focus. The \nimmediate  lesson  arising  from  the  previous  ADB  support  is  the  need  for  streamlined \nimplementation  arrangements,  including  for  project  management  and  procurement.  This  is \naddressed in the design of  the proposed Project. A further lesson is the need to incorporate \nmechanisms to encourage compliance with project covenants. The proposed Project addresses \nthis by linking financing of future projects to accomplishment of reform implementation milestones, \nincluding financial covenants, based on a medium-term framework for reform.  \n \n3.  Asian Development Bank Sector Strategy \n22.  Improvement of transport, including roads, inland waterways, and railways, is one of the \nmain elements of ADB's country strategy for India. In view of the poor state of the country\u2019s \ntransport infrastructure and services, better transport is essential for achieving the higher levels of \neconomic growth needed for sustainable poverty reduction. More efficient railway services will \nfacilitate economic growth. This will raise incomes and create employment, and thereby reduce \npoverty.  Improved  financial  performance  by  IR  will  also  reduce  the  need  to  finance  railway \ninvestments  from  budgetary  sources.  ADB\u2019s  sector  strategy  aims  to  bring  about  overall \nimprovements in sector performance by supporting institutional and policy reforms, strengthening \nprivate sector participation, and financing strategic investments in the high-density rail network. \nWorking in close coordination with the World Bank and other external funding agencies, ADB has \ntaken a lead role in dialogue with the Government over railway sector reform and in formulating a \nbasis for resuming external assistance, linked to government commitment to a credible medium-\nterm framework for reform.  \n \n                                                 \n9  Loan 857-IND: Railways Project, for $190 million, approved on 16 December 1987. \n10 The project was completed in 2002. \n11 Loan 1140-IND: Second Railways Project, for $225 million, approved on 5 December 1991. \n12 ADB. 2000. Project Completion Report on the Second Railway Project in India. Manila. \n   ", "6 \n4.  Policy Dialogue \n23.  In 1997, a long-term strategic assessment for IR was conducted under ADB-financed TA.13 \nThis drew attention to the need to restore IR\u2019s financial sustainability, and proposed options for \nimprovement,  including  increasing  IR\u2019s  commercial  orientation,  cost-reduction  measures, \nstrengthening governance, tariff rationalization, private sector participation, strengthening financial \nsystems, and training. Drawing  on these proposals, in 1998 and 1999 ADB undertook initial \npreparatory work for  the formulation of a project to support reform of IR and finance priority \ninvestment. This included fielding loan fact-finding and appraisal missions. Further processing was \nthen deferred  to allow the Government time to finalize its program for railway reform. Between \n1999 and 2002, MOR carried out studies and consultations to formulate a reform program.14 This \nhelped in establishing a new consensus within MOR both over the need for reform and the main \nelements of reforms required.  \n \n24.  In May 2002, the Minister of Railways submitted a status paper on IR to Parliament. This \npaper drew attention to the need for reform, and presented some of the major issues and options \nfor public debate. These included (i) the need to address deterioration in the finances of IR; (ii) the \ncase for social projects to be funded through a public service obligation mechanism; (iii) the need \nfor overdue investment in IR core business activities, especially  capacity improvement in the \nGolden Quadrilateral and its diagonals; (iv) improving customer orientation to win back freight \ntraffic; (v) the need for lowering freight rates; and (vi) removal of IR cross subsidy of passenger \ntariff, with any subsidy to be met through a public service obligation mechanism. In 2002, MOR \nbegan a process of tariff rationalization by implementing passenger tariff increases well above the \nrate of inflation, and freight tariff increases well below. In May 2002, ADB\u2019s 2002 country strategy \nand program mission reviewed progress toward finalizing the reform program, and agreed to \ninitiate  formulation  of  a  project  that  would  link  resumption  of  ADB  support  for  railways  to \nimplementation of a medium-term program of reforms.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n25.  The  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  improve  the  performance  of  the  railway  sector  by \nsupporting (i) implementation  of  a  program  of  institutional  and  policy  reforms  to  improve IR\u2019s \ncommercial orientation, and (ii) the expansion of core businesses by financing priority investments \nto overcome railway capacity bottlenecks and improve operational efficiency and safety. The \nProject  will  also  contribute  to  organizational  efficiency  by  promoting  outsourcing,  award  of \nconcessions, and use of consolidated contracts for execution of railway investment projects.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n1.  Reform Program \n26.  MOR  has  formulated  a  reform  program  to  transform  IR  into  a  commercially  oriented \norganization in stages over the period 2002\u20132010. It envisages three phases of reform, with \nPhase 1  in  2002\u201305,  Phase 2  in  2006\u201307,  and  Phase 3  in  2008\u201310.  Phase 1  will  entail \n(i) establishing an improved accounting system for IR that is capable of meeting government and \n                                                 \n13 TA 2721-IND: Railway Sector Improvement, for $900,000, approved on 19 December 1996. \n14 In 1999, the Minister of Railways commissioned a Railway Expert Group to examine the financing requirements, \nsources of funding, models of structure and ownership, and regulatory arrangements for railways. The report of the \nExpert Group, released in August 2001, provided a detailed analysis of past problems, and made a series of \nrecommendations to operate IR on commercial lines. \n ", "                                                                   7 \ncommercial accounting requirements; (ii) operating IR as a business, with social responsibilities to \nbe delineated and separately funded by the Government; (iii) a first stage of restructuring noncore \nactivities;  (iv) various  measures  to  improve  customer  orientation,  with  IR  to  concentrate  on \noperating  rail  services  and  the  private  sector  to  take  increasing  responsibility  for  customer \ninterface;  (v) continued  rightsizing  of  staff  strength;  (vi) continued  tariff  rationalization;  and \n(vii) strengthening investment planning to concentrate on investments needed to improve business \nperformance. In Phase 2, the improved accounting system will support a deepening of reforms \nthrough (i) restructuring core businesses as independent  profit/cost centers, and (ii) completing \nnoncore restructuring. Phase 3, which will be intended to see through the implementation of \nreforms, has not yet been defined in detail.  \n \n27.  The Project will establish a medium-term framework for ADB support for MOR\u2019s reform \nprogram, and will provide support for implementation of Phase 1. It will build on past ADB support \nfor  policy  and  institutional  reform  in  the  railway  sector,  and  provide  sustained  support  and \nencouragement for MOR to bring to a conclusion each of the main reform activities. The extended \ntime frame, and the approach of implementing reforms gradually and in stages, reflect the need for \n(i) MOR to retain full ownership of all aspects of the reform program, (ii) many of the reforms to \nevolve  through  trial  and  experience,  (iii) capacity  to  be  built  up  to  support  new  institutional \narrangements, and (iv) railway services to continue to perform their important role throughout the \nperiod of reform implementation. The medium-term framework is summarized in Appendix 6.  \n \n28.  Accounting and Management Information. MOR has decided to design and implement \nimprovements in its accounting system and management information system (MIS) to provide the \nfinancial, operating, and management information needed to increase efficiency, meet emerging \nbusiness needs, and improve commercial orientation. A modern, fully computerized accounting \nsystem  will  be  established  throughout  IR.  This  will  support  existing  government  reporting \nrequirements and provide activity-based revenue and cost data. It will also be capable of providing \nboth government accounts and commercial accounts, with breakdowns by main lines of business \nand by main services within these lines of business. Support for the MIS will cover development of \nMIS applications and implementation of MIS initially in all divisions of two zonal railways and \nsubsequently throughout IR, together with development and implementation of MIS applications for \nsenior managers of zonal railways and at the Railways Board.  \n \n29.  Core Business Restructuring. With support from the improved accounting system and \nMIS,  MOR  will  implement an accounting separation of the main lines of business, separately \nidentifying the main services within these lines of business as independent profit/cost centers. The \nlines of business are expected to consist of freight transport, passenger transport, suburban \ntransport,  fixed  infrastructure,  and  other  infrastructure.  The  availability  of  accounting  and \nmanagement information for each line of business and profit/cost center will provide an important \ninput  for  improving  the  financial  performance  of  the  businesses  and  profit/cost  centers,  and \ndeveloping IR\u2019s commercial orientation. After establishing a first level of commercial orientation \nthrough accounting separation during Phase 1, in Phase 2 MOR will evaluate the structure of its \nmanagement and operations and identify options for improvement, and prepare an action plan \nbased on the identified options. By the end of Phase 2, MOR will  begin implementation of the \nrestructuring of its core business, with a view to completing this during Phase 3.  \n \n30.  Restructuring and  Hiving Off Noncore Activities. In Phase 1 MOR has decided to \nimplement an accounting separation of noncore activities and establish each noncore activity as a \nseparate profit/cost center. Annual reviews of the business performance of each noncore activity \nwill be instituted, with a view to determining appropriate strategies for restructuring and hiving off \n   ", "8 \nnoncore activities,15 based on business performance and potential. MOR will create \u201cfocused \nbusiness organizations\u201d16 and prepare and launch action plans to restructure its production units \nand other noncore activities. Implementation of the action plans will be completed in Phase 2.  \n \n31.  Increasing Private Sector Participation. In an effort to develop innovative solutions to the \nproblem  of  loss-incurring  branch  lines,  MOR  has  decided  to  award  concessions  to  private \ncompanies to operate five of these lines in Phase 1. Private sector operation will offer economies \nthrough flexibility over staffing levels and streamlining of service operation, and is expected to \nimprove revenue collection. After review of the performance of these concessions, MOR will \nprepare and launch an expanded program of awarding concessions.17  \n \n32.  Reengineering Business Processes. MOR has identified the need to redesign its internal \nbusiness processes and simplify its interface with customers. Many processes involve numerous \nlengthy manual steps that can be reduced to a single, often instantaneous step using modern \ninformation  technology.  In  Phase 1  support  will  be  provided  to  assist  MOR  to  develop  and \nintroduce  redesigned  processes  on  a  pilot  basis  in  one  zone.  These  will  be  implemented \nthroughout IR in Phase 2.   \n \n33.  Tariff Rationalization. MOR has decided to implement a sustained rationalization of tariffs \nfor passenger and freight services to correct past imbalances between and within its passenger \nand freight tariffs, with a view to improving the profitability and competitiveness of its passenger \nand freight services. This will be undertaken in accordance with the established processes and \nprocedures for setting railway tariffs in India. Passenger fares and freight tariffs are decided as part \nof  the  annual  railway  budget,  which  is  prepared  in  consultation  with  other  government \nfunctionaries, and are subject to the approval of Parliament. Tariff rationalization was initiated in \n2002/03 when Parliament approved an average passenger fare increase of 12% and an average \nfreight tariff increase of 2.7%.  \n \n34.  Delineating Social and Commercial Objectives. An interministerial committee will be \nestablished to formulate a transparent public service obligation mechanism to reduce the burden of \nMOR being required to provide uneconomic services for social reasons. The mechanism will then \nbe introduced throughout IR. This will be facilitated by the improvements in the accounting system, \nwhich will provide improved information on the financial performance of profit/cost centers within \nthe various lines of business.  \n \n35.  Rightsizing. MOR will continue its policy of reducing its overall staffing through natural \nattrition at a net rate of 2% per annum.  \n \n36.  Core Business Investment Planning and Selection. MOR has decided to prepare and \nimplement changes in its investment project selection processes and procedures to institutionalize \nthe use of its Long-Range Decision-Support System and related systems for investment selection \non the basis of expected returns. By the end of Phase 1, MOR will have adopted this system for \nselecting  all  line  capacity  investment  projects  and  prepared  a  medium-term  investment  plan \nidentifying the priority investments to be implemented over the next 5 years.  \n \n                                                 \n15 MOR uses \u201chiving off\u201d to describe options ranging from separation to divestiture.  \n16\n MOR uses \"focused business organization\" to refer to organizations such as the Container Corporation of India, the \nRailTel Corporation of India, and the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation, that were previously part of \nmainstream IR activities and have been established as independent entities within IR or as companies owned by the \nGovernment to afford them sufficient autonomy to perform their activities effectively.  \n17 Other ongoing MOR private sector participation initiatives include establishing private-public partnerships to develop \nnew rail lines, and inviting private sector freight forwarders and freight terminals to provide services for railways traffic.  \n ", "                                                                   9 \n37.  Consulting services will be provided to support implementation of the reform program \nduring Phase 1. Aspects of the reform program  identified in advance as requiring such support \ninclude  improving  the  accounting  system  and  MIS,  reengineering  business  processes,  and \nimproving investment planning and selection. A timetable for undertaking the accounting system \nconsulting services is in Supplementary Appendix  A. Additional support requirements for both \nimplementation and monitoring of the reform program will be identified by MOR during project \nimplementation, with the terms of reference for ADB-financed consulting services being subject to \nADB approval. The  Project will also finance capacity building and training to disseminate and \ninstitutionalize the main reform activities.  \n \n2.  Investment Subprojects \n38.  The  Project  will  finance  priority  investments  to  strengthen  IR  core business activities. \nInvestment subprojects will concentrate on capacity augmentation recommended by  the Long-\nRange Decision-Support System to overcome freight bottlenecks and safety improvements. These \nwill principally be in the Golden Quadrilateral and its diagonals, which together account for about \ntwo thirds of MOR\u2019s freight traffic. There will also be provision for construction of new railway lines \nexpected to have high economic and financial returns. \n \n39.  The investments will be part of the Government\u2019s medium-term railway sector investment \nplan, known as National Rail Vikas Yojana, to be implemented over a period of 5 years during \nFY2003\u20132007. The overall objective of the plan is to address capacity bottlenecks on the main \nfreight  routes  and  to  enable  faster  growth  in  railway  traffic.  Of  the  total  estimated  cost  of \nRs153 billion ($3.2 billion equivalent), capacity augmentation on the Golden Quadrilateral and its \ndiagonals will account for Rs80 billion ($1.7 billion equivalent).18 Other components will include \ndevelopment of port connectivity and multimodal corridors, and construction of major bridges. \nDetails of the sector investment plan are in Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \n40.  The investment component will follow ADB\u2019s sector lending modality. This is considered \njustified  since  (i) MOR  has  a  well-defined  investment  plan  to  address  the  priority  capacity \nexpansion requirements and safety improvements of the  railway sector; (ii) as one of India\u2019s \nleading institutions with extensive experience in project implementation, MOR has the institutional \ncapacity to implement the investment plan; and (iii) through the reform component of the Project, \nMOR will implement an institutional and policy reform program to improve the overall sustainability \nof investment in the railway sector. \n \n41.  The sector lending modality requires the borrower to prepare a group of sample subprojects \nprior to loan approval, and then prepare additional subprojects during project implementation \naccording to agreed criteria and procedures. Four sample subprojects were prepared for Board \nconsideration. These were (i) Tomka-Keonjhar new railway line (96 km); (ii) double tracking of the \nPullampet-Gooty route (151 km); (iii) adding a third track on  the Bhatapara-Urkura line (60 km); \nand (iv) construction of Mahanadi River second bridge (2.1 km). For each sample subproject, MOR \nprepared feasibility studies to examine the technical, economic, and financial feasibility, as well as \nidentify  environmental  and  social  impacts  and  determine  any  mitigation  measures  required. \nDescriptions and cost estimates of the four sample subprojects are in Appendix 7. \n \n                                                 \n18 Golden Quadrilateral investments will cover (i) replacement and improvement of existing track to enable freight trains \nto run at 100 kph, compared with a maximum speed of 75 kph for loaded trains at present; (ii) doubling of the single \nline on the Mumbai-Chennai route; (iii) provision of third and fourth lines, and electrification of lines, on routes \nidentified by the Long-Range Decision-Support System analysis of capacity bottlenecks; (iv) provision of additional \nsignaling to support higher train speeds; (v) safety enhancement works at grade crossings; and (vi) upgrading of \nrolling stock to run at higher speeds. \n   ", "10 \n42.  Preparation  and  approval  of  additional  subprojects  will  be  undertaken  during  project \nimplementation  in  accordance  with  the  selection  criteria  and  approval  procedures  given  in \nAppendix  8.  The  selection  criteria  refer  to  (i) the  type  and  size  of  subprojects,  and (ii) their \npreparedness  in  terms  of  technical  and  economic  feasibility  and  design,  and  their  social, \nresettlement, and environmental aspects. After completing the remaining tasks for the preparatory \nstudies  for  sample  subprojects,  MOR  will  proceed  with  identifying  and  preparing  additional \nsubprojects of estimated value sufficient to utilize the balance of project financing available for the \ninvestment component. MOR will initially submit sketches of proposed additional subprojects to \nADB for review of compliance with the selection criteria. For each proposed subproject approved \nfor further preparation by ADB, MOR will then undertake preparatory studies to be submitted to \nADB for approval. MOR will then prepare procurement documents for each approved subproject \nand submit these to ADB for approval. It is intended that the preparation tasks for all of the \nadditional subprojects will be carried out about 6 months after the respective tasks are completed \nfor the sample subprojects. \n \n43.  MOR-financed consultants will assist MOR (i) to conduct preparatory studies required by \nADB for investment subprojects to be included in the Project, and (ii) to prepare tender documents \nand provide precontract services up to award of contract. These will include at least one consultant \nwith extensive experience of ADB policies and procedures for project preparation, procurement, \nand administration. Draft terms of reference for these services are in Supplementary Appendix C. \nLoan-financed consulting services will monitor the implementation of the investment subprojects at \nintervals of 6 months. Outline terms of reference for these services are in Appendix 9.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n44.  The Project will establish the basis for ADB to support railway reform through a series of \nproposed  loans  linked  to  a  medium-term framework for ADB support to the reform program \n(Appendix 6). In addition to the Project, the India country program tentatively envisages further \nloans for railway improvement in 2005 and 2007. Processing and approval of each loan will be \ncontingent on successive accomplishment of milestones in MOR\u2019s reform program. Based on the \nreform program drawn up by MOR, the framework and milestones were agreed with MOR as part \nof the policy dialogue during project formulation, and are considered both realistic and achievable. \nThe selection of reform implementation milestones focused on identifying a small number of critical \noutcomes of the reform program at intervals of 2\u20133 years to be achieved and verified in advance of \nADB approving each successive loan. The linking of further ADB financing to accomplishing of \nmilestones will provide MOR with encouragement to implement its reform program in full and on \nschedule.  The  milestones  up  to  processing  and  approval  of  the  proposed  loan  tentatively \nscheduled for 2005 are included as dated covenants in the Loan Agreement for the Project (para. \n99\u2013Specific Assurances). Proposed milestones to be included under phases 2 and 3 of the reform \nprogram, and covenanted under proposed ADB loans tentatively scheduled for 2005 and 2007, are \nin Appendix 6. The medium-term framework and the reform implementation milestones for phases \n2 and 3 will be refined as part of processing the future projects.  \n \n45.  By confirming MOR\u2019s commitment to a credible reform program, the Project is expected to \nserve as catalyst for other multilateral and bilateral agencies to resume financing operations for the \nrailway sector, and improve MOR\u2019s standing for purposes of domestic market borrowing and \nobtaining export credit financing. This will assist MOR to address the large backlog of investments, \nand  contribute  toward the Government\u2019s  objective  of  reducing  MOR\u2019s  reliance  on  budgetary \nfinancing and encouraging it to draw upon multilateral, bilateral, and commercial sources of \nfinancing. \n \n ", "                                                                   11 \n46.  The reform component will support wide-ranging improvements in the overall governance of \nIR.  Establishing  an  improved  accounting  system  will  strengthen  financial  accountability  and \ntransparency by providing on-line financial information for each of IR\u2019s main lines of business and \nprofit/cost centers. This will also provide the basis for overall improvements in the management of \nIR, by providing a means for making lines of business and profit/cost centers more accountable for \ntheir business performance. This is expected to lead, during later phases of the reform program, to \na review of the structure of IR management and operations, and identification and implementation \nof options for restructuring. The proposed delineation of commercial and social responsibilities will \nremove a problem of conflicting objectives that has hampered the governance of railways in the \npast. Measures to increase IR\u2019s commercial orientation will help make it more accountable to its \ncustomers.  \n \n47.  The investment component will be implemented by a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that will \nbe established under the Companies Act for the purposes of implementing major investment \nprojects on behalf of MOR. The SPV will have delegated authority for procurement and staff \nrecruitment (para. 53). By establishing a dedicated project management and supervision capacity \nunder the SPV, assisted where necessary by consulting services, the Project will streamline \narrangements for execution of large investment projects by MOR. By implementing the investment \ncomponent through consolidated contracts using international competitive bidding (ICB), it will \nassist MOR to introduce more efficient approaches to contract packaging, and reduce the scope \nfor implementation delays associated with having to coordinate numerous small contracts.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n48.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $579.2 million equivalent inclusive of taxes, \nduties, and interest and other charges on the loan during construction. The foreign exchange cost \nis estimated at $340.8 million (59%). The local currency cost (including taxes and duties) is \nestimated at $238.4 million equivalent (41%). The estimated cost of the Project is shown in Table \n1. Further details are in Appendix 10. \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimate \n($ million) \n \nForeign  Local  Total  \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \n       \nInvestment Subprojectsa  299.2  226.6  525.8 \nConsulting Services, Training, and Management Information System  9.0  11.8  20.8 \nFront-End Fee  3.1  0.0  3.1 \nInterest During Construction  29.5  0.0  29.5 \n  Totalb  340.8  238.4  579.2 \na In mid-2002 prices. \nb Including taxes and duties. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n49.  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  will  provide  a  loan  of $313.6 million from its ordinary capital \nresources, which will represent 54% of the total cost of the Project. The loan will finance the foreign \nexchange  cost,  excluding  interest  and  other  charges  on  the  loan  during  construction,  and \n$5.4 million of the local currency cost. \n \n   ", "12 \n50.  The justification for financing a small portion of local currency cost is that this will provide for \nADB involvement in reviewing the terms of reference, recruitment, and execution of  consulting \nservices that are of strategic importance to the reform component. \n \n51.  The proposed ADB loan will have an amortization period of 25 years, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, with interest determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending rate \nsystem. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  on  the  basis  of  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The Borrower will be India, which will pass on the proceeds of \nthe loan to MOR in local currency in accordance with the Government\u2019s policies in this regard, \nthrough a budget line additional to MOR\u2019s budget allocation under the 10th Five-Year Plan. MOR \nwill issue a sanctioning order each year allotting funds to the zonal railways where the investment \nsubprojects are to be undertaken, and authorize the respective zonal railways to transfer these \nfunds to the SPV for implementation of the subprojects. The financing plan for the Project is in \nTable 2.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n \nSource  Foreign Exchange  Local Currency  Total  Percent \n         \nAsian Development Bank  308.2  5.4  313.6  54 \nGovernmenta  32.6  233.0 a  265.6  46 \n  Total  340.8  238.4  579.2  100 \na \nIncluding taxes and duties. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n52.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the Project will be MOR. The chairperson, Railways Board, \nwill provide overall leadership for the reform program, reporting to the Minister of Railways. The \nadditional member planning, reporting to the chairperson, Railways Board, has been designated \nproject director for the reform component, to be supported by an executive director, a director, and \nsufficient  suitably  qualified  staff  in  the  Planning  Directorate.  MOR  will  establish  a  standing \ncommittee to monitor implementation of the reform program. \n \n53.  MOR will establish an SPV under the Companies Act to implement its proposed investment \nprogram for augmenting capacity on the Golden Quadrilateral  (para. 39). This SPV will be the \nimplementing agency (IA) for the investment component of the Project. Both the SPV and the \nrailway  facilities  to  be  developed  through  the  investment  component  will  be  owned  by  the \nGovernment acting through  MOR. MOR will conclude a memorandum of understanding with the \nSPV setting out the financial and administrative arrangements regarding the implementation of the \nProject. The SPV will be delegated sufficient administrative authority for effective and timely \ndecision making on project implementation matters, including authority for recruitment of suitably \nqualified staff for management and supervision of investment projects, and for award of tenders up \nto Rs2,000 million ($41 million equivalent). The managing director of the SPV will be the project \ndirector  for  the  investment  component,  supported  by  an  especially  established  project \nimplementation unit  within the SPV. The  unit will be staffed with experienced personnel at the \nmanagement level at the SPV\u2019s headquarters and at the subproject sites. For each subproject, a \nsubproject coordinating committee will be established to coordinate implementation activities of the \n ", "                                                                   13 \nSPV,  the  respective  zonal  railway,  relevant  government  agencies,  and  major  customers. \nImplementation arrangements are shown in Appendix 11.  \n \n2.  Period of Implementation \n54.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 66 months, inclusive of preconstruction \nactivities. The scheduled completion date for civil works and equipment installation is December \n2007. This takes into account MOR-financed domestic consulting services to support advance \nprocurement action for the sample subprojects and to start drawing up preparatory studies for the \nadditional subprojects. The proposed implementation schedule is in Appendix 12. \n \n3.  Procurement \n55.  Procurement to be financed from the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Civil works contracts over $3 million will be procured through ICB, and \nthose below $3 million will be procured through local competitive bidding. Procurement  of civil \nworks under ICB and  local competitive bidding  will be carried out among prequalified bidders. \nProcurement of equipment will use ICB for contracts with an estimated value of at least $500,000, \ninternational shopping for contracts with an estimated value of $100,000\u2013500,000, and direct \npurchase arrangement for contracts of less than $100,000. Indicative contract packages for the \nfour sample subprojects are in Appendix 13. Contract packages for additional subprojects will be \ndecided during project implementation, based on the approach used for the sample subprojects, \nand  contract  packages  for  equipment  supply  will  be  based  on  technical  requirements.  ADB \napproved advance procurement action  for  procurement  of  civil  works  and  equipment  on  the \nunderstanding that such approval would not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n56.  International and domestic consulting services will assist MOR to implement the reform and \ninvestment components. The terms of reference for all loan-financed consulting services will be \nsubject to prior ADB approval. The consultants will be engaged using ADB\u2019s quality and cost-\nbased selection procedures and according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants.  \n \n5.  Accounts, Audit, and Reports \n57.   MOR will monitor the implementation of the Project in accordance with the implementation \nschedule and the time-bound reform implementation milestones, and will keep ADB informed of \nany significant deviations that could result in the schedule and milestones not being met. For this \npurpose, MOR will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly progress reports on the reform and \ninvestment components in such form and detail as ADB may reasonably require. Within 6 months \nof all investment subprojects being open for traffic, MOR will furnish to ADB a project completion \nreport providing details of project implementation costs and benefit monitoring and evaluation \nactivities for the investment component, and reform implementation performance in relation to the \nmedium-term framework for the reform program.  \n \n58.   MOR will provide ADB with a copy of the IR annual report and accounts not later than 12 \nmonths after the end of the related fiscal year, and a copy of IR\u2019s preliminary financial statements \nnot later than 9 months after the end of that fiscal year. From FY2006 onward, within 9 months of \nthe end of the fiscal year, MOR will also provide ADB with audited consolidated accounts and \nfinancial statements prepared on the basis of commercial accounting standards. MOR will ensure \nthat the IA for the investment subcomponent will maintain computerized commercial accounts, and \n   ", "14 \nmaintain separate records and accounts adequate to identify the financing resources received, and \nexpenditures made, on the Project, including the goods, works, and services financed either by \nADB or out of local funds. The accounts-related financial statements for the IA and the Project will \nbe audited annually by independent statutory private auditors appointed by the Comptroller and \nAuditor General of India, and in accordance with the Companies Act. MOR will provide ADB with \nthe audited reports and related financial statements for the IA not later than 6 months after the end \nof its fiscal year.  \n \n6.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n59.  The  EA  will  establish  a  capability  for  systematic  project  performance  monitoring  and \nanalysis throughout the life of the Project, which will be integrated with its MIS and, initially, which \nwill develop and conduct a \u201cquick and easy\u201d rapid sample survey to establish a baseline for \nsubsequent performance monitoring. Thereafter, surveys will be conducted annually. The scope of \nthe survey, quantity and quality of data, and frequency for collection will be guided primarily by the \nproject management\u2019s need for progressive rapid feedback on implementation status, as well as \nearly  warning  of  impending  situations  that  might  jeopardize  attainment  of  the  development \nobjectives. The key indicators and assumptions outlined at the output and development objective \n(i.e., purpose and goal) levels in the project framework (Appendix 1), will form the basis for most of \nthe data required for rapid assessment.  \n \n7.  Project Review \n60.  A project coordinating committee comprising representatives of MOR, Ministry of Finance \n(MOF), and ADB will monitor progress in implementation  of the reform program, and agree  on \nactions needed to overcome any shortcomings in reform implementation. The committee will be \nchaired by  the chairperson, Railways Board. During the first  2  years of implementation, the \ncommittee will meet at intervals of 6 months. The interval in subsequent years will be decided by \nthe midterm review. \n \n61.  In addition to regular reviews by ADB staff, the Loan Agreement will include a requirement \nthat there be a detailed midterm review of the Project. Based on the project schedule, this will be \ncarried out around June 2005. Two months prior to the midterm review the Government will submit \nto ADB a detailed progress report on the implementation and achievements of the reform program, \nand accomplishment of the reform implementation milestones. Terms of reference for the midterm \nreview will be included in the project administration memorandum to be prepared by ADB\u2019s \ninception mission for the Project. \n \nIV.  NONLENDING ASSISTANCE \n62.  An advisory  TA for $500,000 will be provided for Management Consulting Services to \nIndian Railways. The TA will cover (i) study of business development and business opportunities, \n(ii) study of progress of implementation of reform program and reform implementation milestones at \nperiodic intervals, and (iii) advice on management- and business-related issues to be identified \nduring implementation of the reform program. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 14. \n \n63.  The TA will be attached to the Project, and financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram.  The  TA  will  be  carried  out  by  a  firm  of  domestic  management  consultants.  An \ninternational expert or experts may be brought in to work with the domestic consulting firm where \nsuch expertise in specific areas is considered necessary. The consulting firm will be engaged using \nADB\u2019s quality and cost-based selection procedures and according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \n ", "                                                                   15 \nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Financial Performance  \n64.  IR  is  required  to  maintain  its  accounting  records  in  accordance  with  government \nappropriation accounting regulations and its financial system as part of the consolidated fund of the \nGovernment. The Government\u2019s budgetary contribution to IR is reflected in IR\u2019s balance sheet as \n\u201cCapital-at-Charge\u201d under liabilities and IR is liable to pay  a predetermined dividend on this \ncontribution from its surplus revenue, and thus is equivalent to shareholders\u2019 equity. The financial \nstatements of IR have several accounts  that are different from generally accepted accounting \nprinciples. For example, IR adopts a unique method for fixed asset accounting as it maintains the \nacquisition values of fixed assets, rather than depreciating them. Instead, IR appropriates a certain \namount in the \u201cDepreciation Reserve Fund\u201d, which is credited when IR replaces its fixed assets. In \naddition, IR\u2019s pension accounting method, based on a non-accrual basis, tends to understate the \npension liability and accordingly overstate IR\u2019s net assets.  \n \n65.  In the past, IR\u2019s financial performance has generally been satisfactory. In FY1993\u20131997 its \noperating ratio19 was around 75%. However, over the 4 most recent years (FY1998\u20132001), the \noperating ratio deteriorated to 87\u201393%. This reflected the impact of the Fifth Pay Commission, \nwhich approved an overall average salary increase of around 33% for IR staff, together with slower \nrevenue growth caused by the Asian financial crisis. The deterioration of financial performance was \nalso reflected in other financial ratios. The return on capital employed, which had generally been in \nthe range of 9\u201314% before FY1997, declined to 2\u20136% in FY1998\u20132001. Similarly, the return on \nfixed assets was generally in the range of 10\u201316% before FY1997, but declined to 2\u20137% in \nFY1998-2001.   \n \n66.  From FY2002, however, the increase of labor cost will be well contained since IR is \ncommitted to achieving its target of reducing staff strength by 2% every year, and the effect of the \nFifth Pay Commission is fully reflected in previous years. Further, with the restructuring of tariffs \ntargeted to eliminate cross subsidies between freight and passenger traffic, IR will capture  a \nsubstantial part of nationwide freight traffic that is growing at a brisk rate after the financial crisis, \nand accordingly its revenue growth is expected to regain its strength from FY2003. Taking into \naccount these factors, it is expected that IR\u2019s financial performance will turn around in FY2003 with \nan  improved  operating  ratio  of  90%.  The  operating  ratio  is  forecast  to  continue  improving \nthereafter, to 86% in FY 2007. \n \n67.  A summary of IR\u2019s past and projected financial performance is shown in Table 3. The \nassumptions and calculations for the past and projected financial statements are in Appendix 15. \n \n                                                 \n19 Operating expenses excluding depreciation as a percentage of operating revenue. \n   ", "16 \nTable 3: Summary of Indian Railways Financial Performance \n(Rs million) \n \n  Actual    Forecast \n  1998/99  1999/00  2000/01  2001/02   2002/03  2003/04  2004/05  2005/06  2006/07 \nIncome Statement Items                     \nOperating Revenue  296,190  329,390  348,804  378,380   406,456  441,268  470,485  506,564  546,364 \nOperating Expenses  278,380  309,100  347,000  362,930   384,140  410,364  433,849  463,670  496,137 \n(Depreciation)  11,550  16,700  23,010  20,000   19,000  20,000  21,000  23,000  25,000 \nOperating Income  17,810  20,290  1,804  15,450   22,316  30,904  36,636  42,894  50,227 \n                    \nBalance Sheet Items                    \nCurrent Assets  30,190  42,275  37,544  40,738   38,252  46,211  49,270  53,049  57,216 \nFixed Assets  392,810  430,274  464,483  478,841   510,233  542,103  585,283  632,607  695,931 \nCapital-At-Charge  257,800  296,553  326,619  341,619   356,619  371,619  386,619  401,619  416,619 \nRetained Earnings  183,179  174,795  173,579  181,205   192,662  218,273  249,548  286,116  338,640 \n               \nFinancial Ratios               \nOperating Ratio (%)  90  89  93  91  90  88  88  87  86 \nROCE (%)  9  6  2  5  6  7  8  8  9 \nReturn on Fixed Assets (%)  7  7  2  5  6  8  8  9  9 \nROCE = return on capital employed. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Analysis \n1.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n68.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated by comparing the with-project \nand without-project scenarios. The existing available rail network has reached capacity and will be \nunable to carry additional goods traffic without the Project. With the Project, the capacity of the rail \nnetwork in the project corridors will be increased and the network will be able to carry more goods \ntraffic.  The  increased  capacity  of  the  rail  network  in  the  project  corridors  will  allow  for  the \nexploitation of mineral resources present in these areas, e.g., iron ore, coal, and dolomite, and \nproducts such as cement, which, as bulk commodities, are best transported by rail rather than \nroad.  \n \n69.  The Project\u2019s economic costs include the resource costs for construction, rolling stock \nacquisition  costs,  operation  and  maintenance  costs,  and  the  social  costs  arising  from  land \nacquisition and resettlement compensation. The main economic benefits generated by the Project \nwere quantified in terms of (i) railway operating cost savings arising from shorter distances and \nfaster travel times, (ii) savings in rolling stock arising from better utilization of rolling stock with the \nelimination  of  rail  detention  times,  (iii) time  savings  resulting  in  reduction  in  working  capital \nexpenses for the goods  transported, and (iv) net additional economic benefits arising from the \nincrease in production of mineral resources that would only be implemented because of the \nincrease in rail capacity delivered by the Project. Benefits accruing to passengers have not been \ntaken into account in the economic evaluation, thus making this analysis conservative.  \n \n70.  The estimated overall EIRR for the sample subprojects is 16.8%. The individual EIRRs for \nthe four sample subprojects range from 14.6% to 17.4%. Sensitivity analysis shows that the overall \nProject, as well as the individual subprojects, will be economically viable under adverse scenarios, \nincluding increased costs, decreased benefits, and implementation delays.  \n \n2.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n71.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the sample subprojects was estimated on the \nbasis of the annual streams of incremental costs and revenues. The estimated overall FIRR is \n ", "                                                                   17 \n15.4%. The individual FIRRs of the four sample subprojects range from 9.8% to 22.3%. In each \ncase, the estimated FIRRs exceed the estimates of the weighted average cost of capital for the \nindividual subprojects, which range from 5.4% to 7.6%.  \n \n3.  Sensitivity Tests \n72.  Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to examine economic and financial viability under \nadverse scenarios, including increased costs, decreased benefits, and implementation delays. The \nanalysis found that both for the individual sample subprojects and overall, the EIRR estimates \nremained above the threshold level of 12%, and the FIRR estimates remained above the weighted \naverage cost of capital. A summary of the economic  and financial analysis is in Appendix  16. \nFurther details are in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \nC.  Social Impact \n1.  Poverty and Social Dimensions \n73.  A poverty and social assessment  was undertaken in the influence areas of the sample \nsubprojects in the states of Chhattisgarh and Orissa. The two states have higher poverty rates than \nthe national average. According to the most recent national study of poverty, they had poverty \nheadcount rates of 37% and 47%, respectively, in 1999/2000, compared with a national average of \n26%.20 Poverty was associated with lack of economic opportunity, with the latter being linked to \ninaccessibility. The  poverty  and  social  assessment found that the districts where the sample \nsubprojects are located had much higher poverty headcount rates than the statewide averages. In \nthese districts, problems of inaccessibility are often severe. \n \n74.  The sample subprojects in Chhattisgarh and Orissa will benefit 5.5 million people living in \nthe areas of influence, of whom about 40% are poor. The poverty and social assessment estimated \nthat the Project will lead to significant expansion of mining, manufacturing, tourism, and agriculture, \nwhich will provide the basis for poverty reduction through increases in income and employment. \nThe expansion of mining and steel production due to the Tomka-Keohjhar subproject alone  is \nexpected to create 70,000  jobs. The Project will support pro-poor economic growth by providing \nmore remote areas with better access to economic opportunities, in part through fostering stronger \ndomestic and international trade links. The construction of the subprojects will also generate \nsubstantial employment in the areas of influence. \n \n75.  Poverty  and  social  dimensions,  including  considerations  of  gender  and  stakeholder \nparticipation,  have  been  incorporated  into  the  design  of  the  sample  subprojects.  The  Loan \nAgreement  includes  assurances  to  require  contractors  to  comply  with  labor  laws,  protect \nconstruction workers against  health risks, and not to  differentiate between men\u2019s and women\u2019s \nwages for work of equal value. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is presented in \nSupplementary Appendix E. \n \n2.  Resettlement \n76.  The EA carried out  social  impact  assessments  of  the  four  sample  subprojects.  The \nassessments identified potential negative impacts of the subprojects and recommended measures \nto mitigate such impacts. MOR prepared draft resettlement plans (RPs) to establish the basis for \nmitigation.  \n \n                                                 \n20 Government of India. 2001. Poverty Estimates for 1999-2000. Press information Bureau. February.  \n   ", "18 \n77.  Land acquisition for the Tomka-Keonjhar subproject began in 1984 and most compensation \nwas paid before ADB involvement and before ADB established policies on involuntary resettlement \nin 1995 and on indigenous peoples in 1998. The social impact assessment included an audit of the \nprevious resettlement and compensation activities. This identified some shortcomings, including \ncases of people not having received compensation, lack of compensation for lost structures, the \nneed for restoration of facilities and services affected by construction, and the need for income \nrehabilitation and livelihood programs. To address these shortcomings, MOR has prepared a draft \nremedial resettlement action plan (RRAP). A summary RRAP is in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \n78.  Although an indigenous peoples development plan (IPDP) is not required for the Tomka-\nKeonjhar subproject, since 47% of affected persons are categorized as scheduled tribes, and they \nhave higher poverty levels than the state average,21 ADB considered it appropriate to prepare a \nlivelihood program for indigenous peoples in the influence area of the subproject, to be developed \nin parallel with the Project. This program will seek to improve the livelihood of tribal communities by \nempowering them to develop income-generating activities in the market economy, drawing upon \nthe comparative advantages provided by their culture and social capital.22 Additionally, to guide \nmitigation measures for any additional subprojects with impacts on scheduled tribes, an  IPDP \nframework is provided in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n79.  The  Pullampet-Gooty  subproject  will  require  22  hectares  (ha)  of  land  and  affect  98 \nhouseholds and small enterprises. MOR has prepared a draft resettlement plan. A summary \nresettlement plan is in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n80.  The  Mahanadi River second  bridge  and Bhatapara-Urkura subprojects will not involve \nsignificant  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Railway  land  is  available  for  these  subprojects; \nadditional land does not need to be acquired. The subproject sites are free of encroachments and \nno agricultural activities are being carried out there. A summary of a short RP is presented in \nSupplementary Appendix I. \n \n81.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement,  the  SPV  will  appoint \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) to assist in the implementation of the RPs and RRAPs, and \na consultant to conduct independent monitoring and verification of implementation of RPs and \nRRAPs. Outline terms of reference for the NGOs and monitoring services are in Supplementary \nAppendixes J and K. \n \n82.  The impacts of the additional subprojects will be mitigated in accordance with government \nlaws and regulations, and ADB policies and safeguard requirements. Such mitigation will be \nreflected in the entitlement matrix derived from the framework of the sample subprojects. The \nframework, RPs, and approach to implementation and monitoring of the sample subprojects will be \nused as models for preparation of additional subprojects under the sector loan. The framework for \nadditional subprojects is in Appendix 17.23  \n \n                                                 \n21 Orissa contains about 13 of the 62 scheduled tribes recognized by the Government, and about 10% of the tribal \npopulation of India. About 95% of these scheduled tribes live in rural areas, many close to forests. They are mostly \nengaged in land-based activities such as agriculture (as cultivators and farm labor) and forestry (forest produce \ncollection and labor). The poverty headcount rate among scheduled tribes is much higher the state average. In 1991 \nmore than two thirds of tribal people living in rural areas of Orissa were below the poverty line.

Environmental Impact \n83.  The proposed investment component of the Project is categorized as a \u201cB\u201d project in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements.24  An  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) was prepared for the sample subprojects. The IEE shows that the environmental \nimpacts associated with establishment of double and triple tracks, including bridge construction, \nare negligible. The project areas of influence are topographically flat, and no environmentally \nsensitive areas will be affected. The establishment of new track will generate significant impacts \nassociated with the formation of embankment. However, manageable mitigation measures will be \nimplemented  as  part  of  the  construction  works.25  Furthermore,  adequate  environmental \nrequirements are also being incorporated into the bidding documents to ensure that all construction \nmaterials (sand and gravel) will be taken or mined in an environmentally sound manner. The \nenvironmental management plan as part of the IEE has been prepared in sufficient detail to be \nenforced by IR. The summary IEE is in Appendix 18. \n \n84.  MOR  will  conduct  a  training  program  to  strengthen  IR\u2019s  capacity  in  addressing \nenvironmental concerns associated with its activities, including supervising implementation of the \nenvironmental management plan covered in the IEE report, integrating environmental concerns \ninto the planning program of expansion of railway facilities, and handling environmental problems \nassociated  with  maintenance  workshops,  railway  stations,  and  diesel  filling  stations.  An \nenvironmental  training  manual  will  also  be  prepared.  Outline  terms  of  reference  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix L. \n \nE.  Project Risks \n85.  The most significant project risk is that the reform program will not be implemented in full \nand therefore that improvements in sector performance will be less than expected. This risk has \nbeen mitigated in the design of the Project by establishing a series of reform implementation \nmilestones  to  be  met  before  further  ADB  financing  is  provided.  This  will  provide  MOR  with \nencouragement to implement its reform program in full and on schedule.  \n \n86.  The main risk for the investment component is that implementation will be delayed. This risk \nhas been addressed by the establishment of an SPV to act as the IA. The SPV will have authority \nto take decisions on implementation, including procurement, and have sufficient suitably qualified \nstaff to manage implementation effectively.  \n \n87.  The economic analysis of the investment component suggests that there are no significant \neconomic risks. The criteria for selection of subprojects limit the choice of subprojects to priority \ncapacity-expansion  investments  expected  to  have  high  economic  and  financial  returns,  and \nstipulate careful prior screening and analysis of each subproject.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n88.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n                                                 \n24 The investment component is not subject to the Government\u2019s environmental impact assessment regulation. \n25 For example, establishment of slope stabilization, culverts, and diversion of small streams. \n   ", "20 \n1.  Implementing Agency \n89.  MOR and the SPV will not assign, abrogate or waive the memorandum of understanding \nbetween MOR and the SPV without agreement of ADB, and will advise ADB of any changes to the \nequity, functions, and staffing of the SPV. In cases where in the view of ADB such changes may \naffect the ability of the SPV to perform its functions as an IA, ADB may take action pursuant to the \nLoan Regulation Applicable to LIBOR-Based Loans Made from ADB\u2019s Ordinary Capital Resources, \ndated 1 July 2001, to cancel or suspend the loan or accelerate maturities.  \n \n2.  Financial \n90.  Except as ADB will otherwise agree, IR will maintain a ratio of total operating expenses \nexcluding depreciation to total operating revenue not higher than 90% for the fiscal years from \n2002/03 onwards. Three months before the end of each of these fiscal years, MOR will, on the \nbasis of forecasts which shall be satisfactory to ADB, review whether IR is expected to meet these \nrequirements in respect of such year and the following fiscal year, and will furnish ADB the results \nof such review. If any such review shows that IR is not expected to meet the requirements, MOR \nwill promptly take all necessary measures in order to meet such requirements. \n \n91.  Subject to approval by Parliament, MOR will take all necessary action to rationalize tariffs to \nimprove the profitability and competitiveness of its passenger and freight services. \n \n3.  Resettlement \n92.  Assurances pertinent to resettlement are as follows:  \n \n(i)  For each subproject, MOR through the SPV will ensure that relocation, resettlement, \nand compensation for all persons who are adversely affected by the Project or who \nwill be relocated as a consequence of the Project (project-affected persons) will be \npromptly  and  efficiently  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  RP  and  the  IPDP \nframework agreed between the Government and ADB, ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary \nresettlement, and ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement, and other safeguard policies, \nsuch that project-affected persons will improve or at least maintain their preproject \nstandard of living. Project-affected persons without formal title to land will be entitled \nto resettlement assistance and benefits in accordance with the IPDP framework.  \n \n(ii)  Through the SPV, MOR will recruit consulting services to conduct independent \nmonitoring and evaluation of implementation of the RPs and RRAP. \n \n(iii)  Through the SPV, MOR will ensure that for each subproject a full census of affected \npersons and inventories of lost assets will be undertaken. \n \n(iv)  The Government will cause MOR and the SPV to ensure that compensation of land \nand all other benefits will generally be paid to  project-affected persons at least 2 \nmonths prior to the dislocation of the project-affected persons from the acquired \nlands, properties, and other immovable assets. \n \n(v)  The SPV will appoint an NGO to assist in the implementation of the RPs and RRAP. \nThe implementation of the RPs and RRAP for the sample subprojects will be \nreviewed and if required, additional mitigation measures will be instituted, prior to \napproval of additional subprojects. \n \n ", "                                                                   21 \n4.  Environmental Issues \n93.  MOR will adhere to ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines in carrying out the Project, and will \nensure that the environmental soundness of all subprojects and that all environmental mitigation \nmeasures recommended in the IEE and SIEE and agreed to by MOR and ADB are incorporated \ninto the project design and followed during construction, operation, and maintenance of the project \nfacilities, irrespective of contractual and financing arrangements. MOR will ensure that the Project \nis undertaken and that all project facilities  are operated and maintained in compliance with all \napplicable  laws,  rules, and regulations, and the environmental assessment requirements and \nenvironmental guidelines of ADB. Appropriate provisions will be built into all contracts with civil \nworks contractors to ensure that negative environmental and social impacts are mitigated during \nconstruction. \n \n5.  Indigenous Peoples \n94.  MOR and the SPV will ensure that, to the extent that any indigenous peoples are likely to \nbe  affected  significantly  under  any  subproject,  the  measures  set  forth  in  the  IPDP  and  the \nFramework will be carried out for each subproject in accordance with the IPDP and the Framework, \napplicable laws and regulations of the Borrower, and ADB's policy on indigenous peoples. \n \n95.  MOR and the SPV will coordinate implementation of the IPDP and the Framework for all \nsubprojects  and  ensure  that  appropriate  resources  are  provided  for  the  preparation  and \nimplementation of the IPDP. \n \n6.  Social Issues \n96.  MOR will ensure that the civil works contractors comply with all applicable labor laws, do \nnot employ child labor for construction and maintenance activities, provide appropriate facilities for \nchildren  in  construction  campsites,  and  disseminate  information  at  worksites  on  the  risks  of \nsexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS as part of the health and safety measures for those \nemployed during construction.  \n \n97.  MOR will require contractors not to differentiate between men\u2019s and women\u2019s wages for \nwork of equal value. MOR will ensure that the bidding documents for any contracts for the project \nfacilities  include  specific  clauses  on  these  undertakings,  and  that  compliance  will  be  strictly \nmonitored during project implementation.  \n \n7.  Implementation of Reform Agenda \n98.  Consistent with MOR\u2019s reform program and the medium-term framework for ADB support \nfor the reform program, the following milestones will be met by the Borrower and MOR: \n \n(i)  Within 14 months of loan effectiveness (June 2004) \n \n(a)  MOR  will  have  awarded  concessions  to  private  operators  to  take  over \noperation  of  loss-incurring  branch  lines  on  a  pilot  basis.  Any  such \nconcessions will be awarded through open, competitive, and transparent \nbidding procedures; and \n \n(b)  MOR will have completed design and implementation of improvements to its \naccounting system to establish a fully computerized system for IR capable of \nproviding both government accounts and commercial accounts consistent \n   ", "22 \nwith  generally  accepted  accounting  standards  for  its  core  and  noncore \nactivities, with breakdowns by main lines of business and by main services \nwithin these lines of business, and will have obtained all necessary approvals \nfor establishing such a system throughout IR. \n \n(ii)  Within 24 months of loan effectiveness (April 2005) \n \n(a)  MOR will have implemented an action plan for  the outsourcing part of its \nnoncore activities; \n \n(b)  consistent with the medium-term framework for ADB support to the reform \nprogram, MOR will have adopted a time-bound action plan to create focused \nbusiness  organizations  from  its  noncore  activities  and  completed \nimplementation of the action plan; and \n \n(c)  MOR and MOF  will have taken a decision on a public service obligation \nmechanism to compensate MOR for being required to continue operation of \nnon-remunerative services, and will have commenced implementation of this \ndecision throughout IR. \n \n(iii)  Within 30 months of loan effectiveness (October 2005), MOR will have \n \n(a)  implemented throughout IR a fully computerized accounting system capable \nof providing both government accounts and commercial accounts for its core \nand noncore activities, with breakdowns by main lines of business and by \nmain services within these lines of business; and implemented an accounting \nseparation of its main lines of business for its core and noncore activities, \nseparately identifying the main services within these lines of business as \nindependent profit/cost centers; \n \n(b)  reviewed  the  pilot  cases  where  concessions  for  the  operation  of  loss-\nincurring branch lines were awarded, and prepared and approved a program \nfor award of further such concessions; \n \n(c)  prepared and approved action plans for restructuring its production units; \n \n(d)  approved proposals for reengineering its internal business processes and \ncustomer interface, implemented these on a pilot basis in one zone, and \ncommenced implementation throughout IR; \n \n(e)  published a medium-term investment plan that prioritizes investments on the \nbasis of expected financial returns; \n \n(f)  evaluated, with MOF, the performance of the railway sector and prepared a \ndetailed assessment of the status of implementation of the reform program, \nand conveyed their findings to ADB; and \n \n(g)  reduced the total staff of IR to not more than 1.41 million persons.  \n \nB.

For the past 150 years railways have played an important role in the social, political, and \neconomic life of India. For most of that time railways were the leading mode of transport, in \nmany places the only available mode. In such a large continental country, railways have offered \nunique advantages for transporting freight and passengers over long distances.  \n \n2.  Privately owned regional railways were built in colonial times to support commerce and \ntrade.1 As the regional railways spread across the country they created the basis for a national \nrailway network. In 1922 the Government established a Railways Board (RB) to act as the \ncountry\u2019s central railway authority. Over the next two decades, the Government gradually took \nover the management and operation of the regional railways. The process of nationalization of \nrailways  was  completed  in  1944.  Thereafter  Indian  Railways  (IR)2  was  organized  as  a \ndepartmental enterprise, wholly owned by the Government, on the basis of 15 zonal railways \nunder the overall control of the RB.  \n \n3.  IR is India\u2019s largest single organization and largest employer.3 Its railway network of \nmore than 63,000 route  kilometers (km) is one of the largest in the world. To operate this \nnetwork  IR  has  6,853  stations,  7,566  locomotives,  and  more  than  260,000  wagons  and \ncoaches. These are maintained in 225 locomotive sheds, 401 passenger car and freight wagon \nrepair depots, and 49 workshops. IR also has six manufacturing units. Its size, and its mode of \noperation as a government department, present special challenges for management of railways \nas a commercial enterprise. They also add to the difficulty of responding to both short- and long-\nterm changes in transport market conditions. \n \n4.  In the past 10\u201320 years, increasing competition from other modes, particularly road \ntransport,4  has  reduced  IR\u2019s  market  share.  As  a  result,  its  financial  performance  has \ndeteriorated, and it has not generated enough resources to finance necessary investments in \nasset  replacement  and  capacity  expansion.  In  order  for  railways  to  make  their  potential \ncontribution to economic growth, the present model of railway provision needs to be modified \nwith  a  view  to  restoring  IR\u2019s  financial  sustainability.  This  will  require  IR  to  strengthen  its \ncommercial orientation, to concentrate on services it can provide at a comparative advantage, \nand to reduce its involvement in services that can now be better provided by others.  \n \nB.  Sector Performance \n1.  Traffic \n5.  Railway freight measured in ton-km (tkm), and passenger traffic measured in passenger-\nkm (pkm), each increased at an average annual rate of around 4% over the past 50 years. The \nrate of passenger traffic growth remained fairly constant over the period. Freight traffic growth \ndeclined slightly, from an average annual rate of 4.5% for FY1951\u201380 to 3.4% for FY1980\u2013\n2001.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Construction of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway from Mumbai to Kalyan began in 1851. \n2  The term \u201cIndian Railways\u201d refers to the 15 zonal railways and 59 subsidiary divisions under the overall \nresponsibility of the Ministry of Railways through the Railways Board. \n3  IR has a capital investment of about Rs 479 billion ($10 billion) and employs 1.545 million staff. \n4  In view of existing and planned investments in highway improvement, this competition is set to intensify. ", "28  Appendix 3 \n6.  Growth in railway traffic has been much lower than growth in total transport demand. \nDuring FY1980\u20132001 total freight traffic grew at an average annual rate of 6.8% and passenger \ntraffic at 8.5%. Over this period the traffic carried by road increased at an average annual rate of \n10.2% for freight and 9.6% for passengers.  \n \n7.  IR\u2019s share of total freight and passenger traffic has steadily declined. Fifty years ago IR \ncarried more than two thirds of both freight and passenger traffic. Twenty years ago it still \naccounted for two thirds of freight, but its passenger share had fallen to one third. By FY2001, \nIR\u2019s share of freight traffic had fallen to less than one third, and its passenger traffic share was \nonly 13%. Trends in road and rail traffic shares are in Table A3.1. \n \nTable A3.1: Trends in Road and Rail Traffic Shares, 1950/51\u20132000/01 \n \n   Freight     Passenger \n   Railway  Road  Total     Railway  Road  Total \nFY  tkm billion% of total tkm billion% of total  tkm billion    pkm billion% of total pkm billion% of total pkm billion\n1951  44  88  6  12  50    67  68  31  32  98 \n1960  82  85  15  15  97    74  51  71  49  145 \n1970  128  71  52  29  180    113  37  189  63  302 \n1980  156  65  84  35  240    199  32  421  68  620 \n1990  237  47  263  53  499    281  21  1,029  79  1,310 \n1991  243  46  283  54  526    296  22  1,079  78  1,375 \n1996  274  40  410  60  684    342  20  1,368  80  1,710 \n2001  312  32  650  68  962     457  13  3,000 a  87  3,457 \na  Estimate \nSource: Ministry of Railways, Planning Commission. \n \n8.  IR\u2019s freight traffic consists mainly of coal, minerals and other bulk commodities. In \nFY2001 coal accounted for 43% of freight traffic (tkm). Six other bulk commodities accounted for \na further 44%. The majority of passenger traffic (pkm) is in low fare categories. In FY2001 \nsecond  class  non-suburban  services  (ordinary  and  mail/express)  accounted  for  75%  of \npassenger traffic, with 19% for suburban (all classes), and 6% for upper class services.  \n  \n2.  Operations \n9.  Along with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the United States (US), India is \none of the few countries in the world with annual railway traffic in excess of 500 billion converted \nton-km (ctkm).5 The passenger share of railway traffic in India is high compared with other \ncountries with large railway operations. In FY2001 passenger-km represented 59% of IR\u2019s total \nctkm, compared with 24% in the PRC and 1% in the US.6 \n \n10.  In  view  of  the  high  investment  cost  of  railway  infrastructure,  the  intensity  of  track \nutilization in terms of ctkm per route km is an important dimension of productivity. IR\u2019s track \nutilization compares well against the railways of Japan and the US, although lower than the \nPRC. Coach and wagon productivity are indicators of efficiency of utilization of a railway\u2019s \nassets. IR\u2019s coach productivity compares favorably with developed countries and the PRC. Its \n                                                 \n5  1 tkm equals 1 pkm equals 1ctkm. \n6  This section draws upon a comparison of operating performance indicators for a group of six countries comprising \n(i) developing countries with extensive railway networks (India and  the PRC); (ii) developed countries with \nextensive railway networks (Japan and the US); and (iii) developing countries with smaller railways (Bangladesh \nand Thailand). ", "                            Appendix 3          29 \nwagon productivity is lower than Japan and the PRC, although much higher than Bangladesh \nand Thailand. Comparative operating performance indicators are in Table A3.2.  \n \n11.  A significant difference  with developed countries is the very high level of staffing IR \nemploys to operate its railway. As a result IR\u2019s staff productivity is much lower than for railways \nin developed countries, although roughly similar to  the PRC and Thailand, and much higher \nthan Bangladesh.  This partly reflects the lower salary levels in India and other developing \ncountries which favor more labor-intensive approaches to production. It is also an indication that \nin the past IR\u2019s staffing was allowed to grow too large. At about half of gross traffic revenues, \nthe present level of staff costs is a structural impediment to improving IR\u2019s financial performance \nand generating resources for investment. To address this problem  the Ministry of Railways \n(MOR) has a policy of reducing staffing at a net rate of 2% per annum.7 As a result, IR\u2019s total \nstaffing was reduced from 1.797 million in 1991 to 1.545 million in 2001. Through continued \nimplementation of this policy MOR plans to steadily reduce staffing to 1.18 million by 2010.  \n \nTable A3.2: Comparative Operating Performance Indicators \n \nIndicatora  Basisb  India  PRC  US  Japan  Thailand  Bangladesh \nTotal Traffic  ctkm billion  769  1,662  1,999  263  13  4 \nPassenger Traffic Share pkm per ctkm  59  24  1  92  77  83 \nTrack Utilization  ctkm million per route km  12  25  10  14  3  2 \nStaff Productivity  ctkm million per staff  500  530  8,700  1,500  550  100 \nCoach Productivity  pkm million per coach  11  12  \u2014  10  8  3 \nWagon Productivity  tkm million per wagon  1.4  2.8  \u2014  2.4  0.3  0.1 \n\u2014 = not available, ctkm = converted ton-kilometer, km = kilometer, pkm = passenger-kilometer, PRC = People\u2019s Republic  \nof China, tkm = ton-kilometer , US = United States \na Indicators for India are for 2000/01, indicators for other countries are for 1999. \nSource: ADB Draft Working Papers for Preparation of Transport Policy. \n \n12.  While some aspects of IR\u2019s track utilization and productivity compare favorably with \nother countries, it faces serious operational problems due to low average speeds on the \nnetwork, and lack of improvement in speeds over time. Since FY1961 the average speed of \ndiesel freight trains has remained around 22 kilometers per hour (kph). The average speed for \nelectric traction has remained around 24 kph. One of the main reasons for low speeds is that \nmany of the busiest routes have reached their designed traffic handling capacity and become \ncongested. This applies in particular to the Golden Quadrilateral routes that account for two \nthirds of IR\u2019s freight traffic. \n \n13.  A further operational problem has been the high and rising level of traffic accidents. \nFrom FY1997 to FY2001 the total number of train accidents per million train km rose from 0.57 \nto 0.64. The majority of accidents were derailments. From FY1997 to FY2001 the number of \nderailments annually increased from 282 to 344. Other accident types included collisions, grade \ncrossing accidents, and fires in trains. MOR statistics indicate that human error was the cause \nof 86% of total train accidents in FY2001, and 7% were due to equipment failure. One of the \ncontributing factors leading to increasing accidents is that many of the assets, such as track and \nbridges,  are  reaching  the  end  of  their  economic  life  and  need  to  be  replaced.  Due  to \nweaknesses in IR\u2019s financial performance, including inadequate provision for depreciation, there \nis a backlog in asset replacement. In the absence of replacement, assets require greater \nmaintenance, but the present high levels of track utilization make it difficult to take facilities out \nof  service  to  perform  maintenance.  In  2000  the  Railway  Safety  Review  Committee \n                                                 \n7  3% attrition less 1% new recruitment. ", "30  Appendix 3 \nrecommended investments of Rs150 billion to improve railway safety. From October 2001 IR \nimposed a surcharge to improve railway safety. The surcharge is expected to raise Rs50 billion \nover 6 years. MOR is also seeking external assistance to provide additional financing of railway \nsafety measures. \n \n3.  Tariffs \n14.  For many years railways have been required to meet social as well as economic \nobjectives. These objectives have been reflected in the process of tariff setting, with commercial \nconsiderations often being outweighed by social and political factors. As a result there has been \nsustained underpricing of passenger services. To cross-subsidize the loss-incurring passenger \nservices, there has been sustained overpricing of freight services.  \n \n15.  The ratio of IR\u2019s average passenger fares per pkm to average freight tariffs per tkm is \nvery low compared with other countries. The ratio of 0.3 for India compares with 1.2 in the PRC, \n2.2 in Japan, 0.7 in Thailand, and 0.5 in Bangladesh.  \n \n16.  Sustained  tariff  imbalance  is  one  of  the  underlying  causes  of  the  operational  and \nfinancial problems faced by IR. Passenger services now account for nearly two thirds of railway \nservices, but contribute only one third of revenue. In FY2001 total passenger revenues were \nRs105  billion,  compared  with  freight  earnings  of  Rs230  billion.  MOR  estimates  that  its \npassenger services incurred a loss of Rs49 billion in that year. \n \n17.  Overpricing of freight has reduced IR\u2019s competitiveness in its main revenue-earning \nmarkets, causing traffic to divert to road and reducing net earnings. Underpricing of passenger \nservices has led to a high volume of uneconomic passenger services. These not only incur \nlosses but also take up scare capacity on high-density routes, contributing to congestion that \nfurther reduces IR\u2019s competitiveness in freight markets.  \n \n4.  Non-Core Activities \n18.  For many years IR pursued the objective of self-sufficiency by having its own capacity \nfor  manufacturing  rolling  stock  and  other  railway  equipment,  and for providing supporting \nservices. It has six large manufacturing units producing electric locomotives, diesel locomotives, \npassenger cars, freight wagons, wheel axles, and components.8 It also operates residential \ncolonies, catering, other on-board services, security, hotels, sanitation, printing presses, medical \nfacilities, schools and colleges, and research facilities. While non-core activities have made an \nimportant contribution to the railways sector in the past, by being run as part of a government \ndepartment and insulated from competition, they have had only limited incentive to be efficient, \nand have not kept up with technology advances. They have been particularly ill-equipped to \nprovide services, such as catering, that require a high degree of customer orientation. The \nexistence of large non-core activities also increases the complexity of managing IR and dilutes \nthe focus of management on the core business of operating railways. There is a need to \nreexamine the role, efficiency, and effectiveness non-core activities, with a view to increasingly \nobtaining inputs of goods and services on the basis of competition, and to separating remaining \n                                                 \n8  As an indication of the scale of these activities, in FY2001 IR\u2019s manufacturing units produced 120 electric \nlocomotives, 105 diesel locomotives, 2,190 passenger cars, nearly 2,000 wagons, and more than 30,000 wheel \nsets.  ", "                            Appendix 3          31 \nnon-core  activities  from  IR\u2019s  core  activities  so  that  they  operate  according  to  commercial \nprinciples.9 \n \n5.  Financial Performance \n19.  Over the period FY1998\u20132001 IR\u2019s financial performance deteriorated. Its operating ratio \nincreased from 87 to 93%, and in FY2001 it had to defer part of the payment of a dividend to the \nGovernment. Although the adverse financial position in these years was partly due to the short-\nterm  factors  including  the  inflationary  adjustment  of  salaries  awarded  by  the  Fifth  Pay \nCommission,  IR\u2019s  financial  decline  helped  draw  attention  to  the  need  for  reform.  The \nGovernment made it clear that IR should not rely on budgetary sources of financing, and \nencouraged IR to proceed with reforms to improve its performance and enable it to attract \nfinancing from multilateral sources and the domestic financial markets. IR\u2019s past and projected \nfinancial performance are presented in Appendix 15.  \n \nC.  Challenges \n20.  While the weaknesses in railway sector performance are manifested in declining market \nshare, adverse operating indicators and reduced revenue generation, their underlying causes \nare to be found in the policy, institutional, and organizational arrangements for railways, which \nare themselves based on the idea of running railways as a social  and  economic  arm  of \ngovernment rather than as a business. A cause-effect analysis is in Appendix 4.  \n \n21.  Although the present railway sector arrangements served India well for many years, they \nare no longer adequate for railways in a transport market characterized by increasing modal \ncompetition and customer choice. The future performance of the railways sector will depend on \nhow effectively it can adapt its services to its changing market position. The fundamental \nchallenge for IR is therefore to establish a commercial orientation. This will involve IR (i) running \nrailways  services  along  business  lines,  including  expanding  activities  that  offer  favorable \ncommercial returns and reducing activities that do not; (ii) concentrating on the core business of \noperating  railway  services;  (iii)  progressively  hiving  off  non-core  businesses,  and  making \nincreased use of outsourcing on the basis of competition; (iv) adopting objective systems for \nselecting investments on the basis expected financial and economic returns, with a view to \nimproving operational performance and capacity in its major markets, notably freight services in \nthe Golden Quadrilateral; and (v) rationalizing tariffs to correct for past overpricing of freight and \nunderpricing of passenger fares, and to adapt individual freight and passenger fare categories \nto improve competitiveness and increase returns. To enable IR to introduce these changes the \nGovernment will have to relieve IR of the burden of continuing to operate loss-incurring services \nthat are required for social reasons. For this purpose the Government will need to establish a \nmechanism for compensating IR for losses on services it would otherwise curtail.  \n \n                                                 \n9  IR opted to create subsidiary companies under the Company Act to afford certain non-core activities greater \nautonomy to operate in a commercial manner. These have included Rail India Technical and Economic Services \n(RITES), a consulting services company; the Container Corporation of India (CONCOR), a rail container services \noperator; the Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC), which arranges financing for procurement of railway \nassets; IRCON, a construction company; Konkan Railway, a special-purpose construction and railway-operating \ncompany; the Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS), an information technology company; Indian Railway \nCatering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC), a hotel and tourism operator; and RailTel Corporation, a railway \ntelecommunications company. While this has improved performance of these activities, in many cases the \nsubsidiaries remain monopoly service providers, and there is scope for further efficiency gains through introducing \ngreater competition with private sector suppliers.

Summary Subproject Descriptions \n1.  Keonjhar-Tomka New Rail Link \n1.  This new broad gauge (BG) line is part of a larger project to construct a new 155-\nkilometer (km) line from Banspani to Tomka. The object of this larger project is to provide iron \nore originating in the Banspani area with a more direct route to port and to two new steel plants \nin the Duburi/Sukinda area, and to serve additional iron ore mines along the new route. \n \n2.  Work on the larger project has been progressing since the mid-1990s. The first section \nof line, a length of 9.4 km between Banspani and Joruli, was opened for traffic in 2000. The \nsecond section of line, a length of 47.3 km between Joruli and Keonjhar, is well advanced and \nscheduled to open in March 2003. Work on the last 96 km between Keonjhar and Tomka was \nbegun in early 2000 and has  progressed to the point where the roadbed is expected to be \ncomplete by December 2003. \n \n3.  The work on this  subproject remaining for financing by  the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) comprises supply and installation of the track structure (except provision of ballast), \nconstruction the railway buildings and other facilities (including electrical installations), and \nsupply and installation of the signaling and telecommunications equipment. \n \n2.  Second Bridge on Mahanadi River \n4.  The proposed construction of a second bridge across the Mahanadi River is part of the \ntrack doubling work being performed by Indian Railways of their lines between Talcher, Cuttack, \nand Paradeep. This is in the area where the Howrah-Chennai main line crosses the routes \ncarrying ore traffic from Talcher and Banspani to Paradeep port. The Project has several parts \nintended to reduce congestion in this area by constructing second tracks and improving junction \npoints. The estimated cost of all the work is Rs2,433,800,000. \n \n5.  Several of the track doubling projects have been completed and others are in progress. \nHowever, the bridge that takes the Howrah-Chennai line across the Mahanadi River is still to be \nconstructed and remains a bottleneck. Soil investigations and detailed design for the Project \nhave been completed. \n \n6.  The selected configuration for the new bridge is to use 32 through-girder steel spans \nwith a length of 65.8 meters (m) each. The piers for these spans will be supported on well \nfoundations. Both span and  substructure will be designed to support 30-ton axle loads. The \nbridge  and  the  track  structure  on  the  bridge  will  be  financed  under  the  loan  while  the \napproaches and connections to the adjacent stations will be constructed as separate contracts \nby Indian Railways.  \n \n3.  Third Line between Bhatapara and Urkura \n7.  The subproject to provide a third line between Bhatapara and Urkura is part of a larger \nproject to increase line capacity between Champa and Bhilai on the Howrah-Mumbai main line. \nThe area between Champa and Bhilai is developing into an industrialized zone along the \nalready heavily used Howrah-Mumbai main line. New coal mines in the area are being opened \nand  attracting  other  industries  such  as  cement  and  steel  production.  The  considerable ", "38  Appendix 7 \npassenger traffic (16 trains per direction per day) on the line means that the available capacity \nfor goods trains is often exceeded, resulting in excessive delays in operation. \n \n8.  This  subproject  between  Bhatapara  and  Urkura  will  complete  the  third  track  from \nChampa to Bhilai. The works on the other sections were approved between 1993 and 2000 and \nmost have been completed. \n \n9.  The scope of the work primarily consists of adding a third track on the west side of the \nexisting double track. The new line will be electrified and signaled to conform with the existing \nline. Through stations and the loop lines and platforms on the west side of the existing lines will \nhave to be relocated to accommodate the third track. \n \n4.  Gooty-Pullampet Track Doubling \n10.  Of  the  existing  215 km  between  Gooty  and  Pullampet  on  the  South  Central \nRailway (SCR), only three short segments, totaling 64 km of line, are laid with double track. The \nremaining 151 km of single track has a planned capacity of 24 to 28 trains per day in each \ndirection. As there are currently eight passenger and 16 goods trains operating in each direction \ndaily, the single track line segments are being used near to their capacity. As such they are \nunable to accommodate expected increases in traffic without experiencing congestion. The \nexpected additional traffic comprises 5 million tons per year of iron ore for export and 2 million \ntons per year of coal for a new power plant. \n \n11.  As a consequence, SCR has elected to complete the line doubling of the entire segment \nfrom Gooty to Pullampet. Generally, the new line will be constructed on the opposite side of the \nexisting track from the loop lines and will include new loops for the up or down trains as \nrequired. \n \nB.

Capacity Issues  \n13.  All of the above subprojects have been reviewed in a general manner to assess whether \nthey are an efficient solution for providing the additional capacity that IR feel they require. In the \ncase of Keonjhar\u2013Tomka, the issue is relatively simple as it is evident that there are mining \nprojects that could not go ahead without the subproject and that the reduction in haul distance \nthat the subproject provides for existing mines is significant. \n \n14.  In  the  case  of  the  other  three  projects,  it  is  clear  that  train  densities  are  rising \nsignificantly. Accommodating these numbers of trains on a single track line produces difficult \noperating conditions. Even if sufficient capacity can be provided by closely spacing loop lines for \ncrossing trains, the delays resulting from these meets add significantly to running times and \nresult in increased fleet requirements and higher operating costs.  \n \n15.  The track doubling and tripling projects proposed are appropriate solutions for capacity \nconstraints identified by IR. They fit in well with the strategy to increase the speed of goods \ntrains to provide overall capacity improvements. \n \n16.  In the longer term, the Indian railways may wish to consider additional strategies for \nimproving line capacity. Improvements can come from increasing the number of trains which \ncan be handled, but this requires large investments in infrastructure. These investments can be \ncontrolled by also investing in the capacity that can be carried in each train. The technical \nsolutions required to achieve this objective are longer trains and higher axle loads.1 Indian \nRailways have already begun to consider implementing these technical conditions, particularly \nfor ore trains on heavily traveled lines. Some design standards have already been prepared, \nhowever they have yet to be implemented on a project. Implementing a demonstration project \nwith these new standards would be a good first step to give the railway some first-hand \nexperience of the results. In addition, it is suggested that Indian railways consider integrating the \nheavier axle load design standards into their new infrastructure projects. For a small incremental \ncost on a current project, it is possible to avoid or mitigate some large expenditures that might \nbe required in the future in order to accommodate the heavier trains. \n \n                                                 \n1  As an example, a typical heavy goods train carries 58 wagons, each loaded with a net weight of 58 tons, resulting \nin 3,364 net tons per train. Trains carrying 10,000 net tons operate in many countries. Generally, this train capacity \nis achieved with 100 or more wagons at 30t axle loads. This has the potential to reduce the number of goods trains \nby two-thirds which provides an enormous increase in the capacity of existing lines. It also has a large impact on \noverall efficiency as the numbers of wagons required are reduced as well as the numbers of train crews. \n ", "   Appendix 8          41 \nSELECTION CRITERIA AND APPROVAL PROCESS FOR SUBPROJECTS \nA.  Subproject Selection \n1.  The selection of subprojects by the Ministry of Railways (MOR) will be subject to Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) approval. The criteria for selection of subprojects are as follows: \n \n(i)  Subprojects will be for priority capacity expansions and safety improvements \nrecommended  by  the  Long-Range  Decision-Support  System  (LRDSS)  to \novercome  freight  bottlenecks,  principally  in  the  Golden  Quadrilateral and its \nDiagonals;  or  for  construction  of  new  railway  lines  expected  to  have  high \neconomic and financial returns.  \n(ii)  The  proposed  scope  and  approach  to  operations  is  the  most  economically \nefficient option available for providing the additional railway capacity required. \n(iii)  On the basis of ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects and its \nGuidelines for Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects, \nthe estimated economic internal rate of return is at least 12% and the estimated \nfinancial internal rate of return is greater than the average weighted cost of \ncapital in real terms.  \n(iv)  Subprojects will be socially sound, and will minimize the need for land acquisition \nand resettlement, and include measures to mitigate any social impacts they will \ncause. \n(v)  Subprojects will be environmentally sound, and no subproject will be located \nwithin  or  adjacent  to  an  environmentally  sensitive  area  (e.g.,  sanctuaries, \nnational parks, or other areas having significant ecological functions). \n(vi)  An initial environmental examination report will have been prepared. \n(vii)  Subprojects will be technically feasible. \n(viii)  Sufficient government counterpart funding will be allocated to implement the \nsubproject as scheduled. \n(ix)  The estimated cost of each subproject will be at least $10 million.  \n(x)  The average of the estimated value of the contract packages for civil works and \nequipment supply will be not less than $5 million equivalent.  \n(xi)  All necessary government and state approvals will have been obtained. \nB.  Approval Process for Subprojects \n2.  All subprojects will be required  (i) to comply with ADB\u2019s policies and guidelines, and \nsatisfy ADB\u2019s procedures for project preparation, including with respect to technical, operational, \nfinancial, economic, environmental, social, and resettlement dimensions, and (ii) to follow ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement.  \n \n \n ", "42  Appendix 8 \n3.  MOR will prepare preliminary thumbnail sketches for candidate additional subprojects to \nutilize the remainder of the loan allocation for investment subprojects. These will include short \ndescriptions of the scope and need for each subproject, and explanation of compliance with \neach of the selection criteria set out in para.  1. The thumbnail sketches for the additional \nsubprojects will be prepared with a view to seeking approval for all subprojects in one tranche. \n \n4.  For  each  subproject  approved  by  ADB  for  further  preparation,  MOR  will  conduct \nsubproject preparatory studies of (i) technical feasibility and cost, (ii) economic analysis, (iii) \nfinancial analysis, (iv) environmental assessment, and (v) social analysis and resettlement \nplanning.  \n \n5.  For each subproject approved by ADB, MOR will prepare prequalification and tender \ndocuments based on ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents and prequalification documents.

Background \n1.  The Ministry of Railways (MOR) has decided to carry out a program of institutional and \npolicy reforms to transform Indian Railways (IR) into a commercially oriented organization in \nstages over the period 2002\u20132010. Through the proposed Railway Sector Improvement Project \n(the Project),  the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is providing support for implementation of \nMOR\u2019s reform program, and has established a medium-term framework for linking future ADB \nsupport to accomplishment of reform implementation milestones. \n \nB.  Objective \n2.  The objective of the consulting services is to provide MOR with advice on IR\u2019s annual \nbusiness performance, to conduct annual monitoring of implementation of the reform program, \nand  to  provide  advice  on  management  and  business  related  issues  identified  during \nimplementation of the reform program. \n \nC.  Scope \n3.  The scope of the consulting services will include the following. \n \n1.  Study of Business Development and Business Opportunities \n4.  From FY2003 to FY2006 annual reviews will be conducted of IR\u2019s business development \nand  business  opportunities  and  advice  will  be  provided  on  actions  needed  to  address \nopportunities and threats: \n \n(i)  Review  available  reports  and  financial  and  other  information,  and  conduct \ndiscussions with IR officials and customers; \n(ii)  Analyze the markets, costs and competitive position of each IR line of business \nand profit/cost center; \n(iii)  Analyze the opportunities and threats to the IR lines of business and profit/cost \ncenters and overall business performance; and \n(iv)  Provide advice to IR on strategies for improving business performance over the \nmedium term (following 3 years). \n2.  Study  of  Progress  in  Implementation  of  Reform  Program  and  Reform \nImplementation Milestones at Periodic Intervals \n5.  In each of the fiscal years 2002/03 to 2005/06, an annual study will be prepared of \nprogress in the performance of the reform program, and the achievement of milestones in the \nmedium-term framework for ADB support to the IR reform program.  \n ", "                                   Appendix 14          49  \n3.  Studies \n6.  Further studies and advisory services will be conducted on aspects of improving IR\u2019s \ncommercial orientation and business performance that will be identified during implementation \nof the reform program, subject to approval of the terms of reference by MOR and ADB.  \n \nD.  Reporting and Dissemination of Findings \n7.  Reports of the annual reviews and study of reform program progress will be submitted to \nMOR and ADB to provide an input to meetings of the project coordinating committee for the \nProject. Reports of studies will be submitted to MOR and ADB.  \n \n8.  The consultants will involve officials of MOR and IR in all aspects of review, analysis, \nand formulation of advice. Workshops and other consultation activities will be held to involve \nrelevant MOR and IR officials in preparation of each component of the services, and to promote \na sense of ownership of the outcomes. With assistance from MOR, the consultants will arrange \nseminars to disseminate the findings of each component of the services upon its completion. \n \nE.  Consulting Services \n9.  The  consulting  services  will  be  carried  out  by  a  reputable  domestic  management \nconsulting firm, to be recruited using ADB\u2019s quality and cost-based selection procedures, and \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. International experts may be brought in to \nwork with the domestic consulting firm where such expertise in specific areas is considered \nnecessary.  The  consulting  team  will  include  experts  in  railways  operations  and  business \nmanagement. It is estimated that 25 person-months of consulting services will be required. \n \n10.  Each year the annual business performance review and reform program monitoring will \ncommence within two months of the end of the fiscal year, and the consultant's reports will be \nsubmitted within eight weeks of the commencement of these services. Time frames for other \nstudies will be agreed upon during implementation, subject to approval of MOR and ADB. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be MOR. The consultants will report to the \nadditional member planning. MOR will provide the consultants with suitably furnished office \naccommodation, local communications, office support staff, local transport, and other necessary \nequipment and facilities as required. MOR will establish a counterpart team, headed by a project \ncoordinator, comprising a minimum of three staff. A steering committee will be established for \nthe technical assistance (TA), chaired by the additional member planning, with representatives \nof relevant parts of MOR and the implementing agency, and from the Department of Economic \nAffairs of the Ministry of Finance and ADB. The committee will meet after receiving the inception \nreport, and at intervals of not more than 6 months over the period of the services, and more \noften as required to provide guidance to the consultants. \n \nG.  Cost Estimate \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $590,000. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $500,000 of the foreign exchange and local currency cost on a grant basis from \nthe Technical Assistance Special Fund. The Government\u2019s counterpart contribution will finance \n$90,000 equivalent of local currency expenditure. \n ", "50  Appendix 15 \nFINANCIAL STATEMENT OF INDIAN RAILWAYS:  NOTES AND ASSUMPTIONS \n \nA.  Accounting Principles \n \n1.  The financial statements of Indian Railways (IR) have been adjusted in accordance with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)1 as explained below. \n \n1.  Depreciation on Fixed Assets \n \n2.  IR presents the acquisition value of its fixed assets without reducing their value through \ndepreciation of assets.  Instead, it appropriates a certain amount of its profits to the depreciation \nreserve fund (DRF). This does not conform with GAAP, which calculate depreciation based on \nasset life. Considering the nature of the fixed assets in railway industry, with economic life \nspans of 20\u201335 years, railways in other countries generally provide depreciation amounting to \n2\u20134% of fixed assets every year. IR\u2019s depreciation was calculated as 3% of the beginning \nbalance of its fixed assets. For presentation purposes, the balance of DRF either in equity or in \nreserve is directly deducted from the acquisition value of the fixed assets. \n \n2.  Reserved Funds \n \n3.  Reserved  funds,  which  are  maintained  by  IR  in  its  reserve  and  equity  sections \nrespectively, were combined and presented as retained earnings. \n \n3.  Interest on Funds Deposited within Government \n \n4.  The interest accrued from the deposit of funds with central government were reflected as \nincome in the income statement. \n \nB.  Assumptions for Projection of Financial Performance \n \n1.  Assumptions for Operating Revenue \n \n5.  Operating revenue is derived from passenger, freight, and parcel and other revenue. \nThe amount of revenue depends on two variables: the volume measure and the unit price. The \nassumptions used for each revenue source are explained below: \n \n(i)  Passenger  revenue:  (a)  volume  measure  in  passenger-kilometers  (km):  6% \nincrease and (b) unit price: 1% real increase;  \n(ii)  Freight revenue: (a) volume measure: in tonne-km: 3% increase and (b) unit \nprice: 0.8% real decrease for 5 years, after that constant; and \n(iii)  Parcel and other revenue: increase by 10% per annum. \n \n6.  During the last 4 years, passenger traffic on average grew by 6.3% per annum. A \ncontinuing increase in passenger revenues is expected through the implementation of tariff \nrestructuring and reform. In the longer term, it is expected that passenger traffic on average will \ngrow at 6% per annum for the next 5 years, and by 5% thereafter. \n \n7.  For the past 5 years, the unit price for passenger traffic fell by 1.2% per annum in real \nterms,  which  implies  a  cross  subsidy  between  freight  and  passenger  traffic.  The  tariff \nrestructuring being pursued by the reform initiatives will enable the unit price for passenger \n                                                 \n1  These principles refer to the preparation of fair and comparable statements of private sector companies. ", "Appendix 15        51 \ntraffic to rise by 1% per year for the next 5 years until the cross subsidy is eliminated, and to \nremain constant thereafter.  \n \n8.   For freight traffic, the growth rate in terms of tonne-km was 2.4% per annum for the past \n4 years. Considering the strategic objectives of the reform initiatives, boosting freight traffic and \nreducing the cross subsidy from freight traffic to passenger traffic, the freight traffic growth is \nexpected to increase at as strong a pace as it has been doing. It is assumed that the freight \ntraffic will increase by 3% per annum for the next 5 years, and by 2% thereafter. For the unit \nprice, which is higher than international levels, it is assumed that the unit price for tonne-km will \ndecrease by 0.8% per annum in real terms for the  next 5 years,  and after that  to remain \nconstant. \n \n9.  For parcel and other revenue, the revenue increase on average was 15.5% per annum \nfor the past 5 years. Given IR\u2019s continuing efforts to improve its parcel business, it is assumed \nthat revenue in this category will increase on average at 10% per annum for the project period. \n \n2.  Assumptions for Expenses \n \n(i)  Labor costs: (a) number of staff: decrease by 2% per annum, and (b) average \nwage: no real increase until the next pay commission is held; \n(ii)  Operating traffic: increase by the same rate as fixed assets; \n(iii)  Reserve for pension fund: increase by 20% in the first year, by 10% in the \nsecond year, and by the rate of average wage growth thereafter; and \n(iv)  Depreciation: 3% of beginning balance of fixed assets. \n \n10.  It is assumed no real wage increase occurs until the next pay commission, which is \nexpected after FY2007. For the number of staff, it is assumed that IR will continue to reduce \nstaff by 2% per annum in line with its commitment. \n \n11.  For the last 2 years, 2% of total staff strength retired each year, which caused a sharp \nincrease in pension payments. Assuming continuing decrease in staff strength  of 2% every \nyear, the high increase of pension payments is expected to continue for 1\u20132 years. However, \nthe pattern of yearly increase of pension payments will be normalized as long as the absolute \nnumber of retired staff will be reduced. For the next 6 years from FY2001, it is assumed that \npension payments will increase by 20% in the first year, by 10% in the second year, and by the \nrate of average wage growth thereafter.   \n \n12.  In line with the general practice adopted by other international railways, the depreciation \nrate has been reduced to 3%. \n \n3.  Assumptions for Other Balance Sheet Items \n \n13.  The  size  of  current  assets  (cash,  accounts  receivable,  and  inventory)  and  current \nliabilities (accounts payable) shows a close correlation with operating revenue.  This correlation \nis assumed to continue for projection purposes.  \n \n14.  The level of contribution from the Government has been provided by IR. \n \n15.

Introduction \n1.  The economic and financial evaluation examined the four sample subprojects of the \ninvestment component of the Project: Keonjhar-Tomka new broad gauge line, (ii) Bhatapara-\nUrkura third line, (iii) Gooty-Pullampet track doubling, and (iv) Mahanadi River second bridge. \nThe without-project case represents the current situation. As capacity on all these lines  is \nsaturated, further traffic growth will be impossible and traffic is assumed to be constant at 2002 \nlevels. In the with-project case, the increase in rail capacity will give an impetus to increased \nproduction of mineral resources and cement, which will form the generated traffic for the region. \nIn the case of the Keonjhar-Tomka new line, the current traffic, which follows a circuitous route, \nwill be diverted to the new line with significant savings in travel distance and travel time. The \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) compared the annual streams of economic capital and \noperating costs and benefits. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) compared the annual \nstreams of financial capital and operating costs and revenues. All costs, benefits, and revenues \nwere expressed in 2002 constant prices. The analysis period is for the construction period \nfollowed by 20 years of operation.  \n \nB.  Traffic Forecasts \n2.  Indian Railways statistics show that along the corridors to be served by the sample \nsubprojects the goods traffic increased at an annual average growth rate ranging from 6.2% to \n31.6% over the last 3 years. The major commodities carried by rail on these corridors are coal, \ncement, iron ore, and other minerals. This is because these corridors serve the  mineral-rich \nareas of Jharkhand, Orrisa, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh states.  \n \n3.  All the existing lines in the subproject corridors have already reached their capacity and \nare experiencing severe detention times ranging from one hour at the Mahanadi Bridge corridor, \nto 2.5 hours at the Bhatapara-Urkura corridor, to 5 hours each for the Keonjhar-Tomka and \nGooty-Pullampet corridors. It is assumed that in light of such severe congestion, there will not \nbe additional traffic on these lines without the Project.  Indian Railways carried out extensive \ndiscussions with existing customers and potential rail freight to estimate the increase in rail \ntraffic volume should rail capacity be increased. The discussions provided confirmation that, in \nthe with-project case, increasing rail capacity will encourage  greater  production of mineral \nresources and cement. Rail traffic will increase at an annual average rate ranging from 3.8% to \n31.2% until the year 2011/12.  \n \nC.  Costs \n4.  The financial costs of the subprojects consist of all incremental capital expenditures but \nexclude price contingency and interest and other charges during construction. The operation \nand maintenance (O&M) costs of the project facilities were estimated on the basis of O&M cost \nparameters  developed  by  Indian  Railways  from  its  accumulated  cost  data.  The  Project\u2019s \neconomic costs include the resource costs for construction, rolling stock acquisition costs, O&M \ncosts, and social costs arising from land acquisition and resettlement compensation. Economic \ncosts exclude price contingencies, taxes, duties, and interest during construction. A standard \nconversion  factor  of  0.85  was  applied  to  financial  costs  of  nontraded  inputs  to  calculate \neconomic prices. Subproject facilities are expected to have an average economic life of 30 \nyears.  \n \n \n ", "56  Appendix 16 \nD.  Benefits and Revenues \n5.  The main economic  benefits generated by the Project were quantified in terms of \n(i) railway  operating  cost  savings  arising  from  shorter  distances  and  faster  travel  times, \n(ii) savings in rolling stock arising from better utilization of rolling stock with the elimination of rail \ndetention times, (iii) time savings resulting in reduction in working capital expenses for the \ngoods being transported, and (iv) net additional economic benefits arising from the increase in \nproduction of mineral resources that would only be implemented because of the increase in rail \ncapacity delivered by this Project. Benefits accruing to passengers were not taken into account \nin the economic evaluation, thus making this analysis conservative.  \n \n6.  In the financial evaluation, the incremental revenue was based on freight revenue with \nand without the Project. Freight tariff rates were assumed to decrease by 0.8% in real terms \nannually for the first 5 years, and to remain constant thereafter.  \n \nE.  Economic and Financial Internal Rates of Return \n7.  EIRR and FIRRs were calculated for the individual sample subprojects and for the \nsample subprojects as a whole. In addition to the base cases, five sensitivity test cases were \nexamined: (i) construction costs increase by 10%; (ii) benefits or gross earnings are reduced by \n10%; (iii) O&M costs increase by 10%; (iv) the construction period  lengthens by 1 year; and \n(v) the construction period lengthens by 1 year and O&M costs increase by 10%.  \n \n8.  Table A16.1 below summarizes the EIRRs for the base case and sensitivity cases. The \nEIRR for the sample subprojects as a whole is 16.8%, and the EIRRs for each of the individual \nsample subprojects are well above the 12% threshold for economic viability. The economic \nviability is quite robust as the EIRR values are generally well above 12% in the sensitivity \nanalysis cases for the sample subprojects as a whole and for the individual subprojects. \n \nTable A16.1: EIRR Values for Base Case and Sensitivity Analysis Cases, %  \n \nKeonjhar- Bhatapara- Gooty- Mahanadi \nScenario  Tomka  Urkura  Pullampet  Bridge  Overall \n           \nBase Case  16.4  17.8  17.1  15.3  16.8 \nSensitivity Tests           \n  (i)  Construction Costs 10% Higher  15.6  17.4  15.8  14.6  16.1 \n  (ii)  Benefits 10% Lower  14.4  13.9  14.5  13.8  14.3 \n  (iii)  O&M Costs 10% Higher  15.9  15.9  16.3  15.1  15.9 \n  (iv)  Construction Period 1 Year Longer  13.9  13.0  14.3  13.6  13.7 \n  (v)  (iii) and (iv) Combined  13.4  11.3  13.6  13.3  12.8 \n       O&M = operation and maintenance. \n \n9.  To assess financial viability the FIRR was compared with the weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC). In estimating the WACC for each subproject it was assumed that (i) the ADB\u2019s \nloan proceeds will be onlent to MOR at 7% interest; (ii) the cost of capital from Government \nbudget will be 7%;1 and (iii) rolling stock financing on a lease arrangement through Indian \nRailways Financing Corporation will be equivalent to 13% interest per annum.

This is average the wage price index rate \nfor the last five years and best represents the inflation rate relevant to this project.  \n \n10.  Table A16.2 below summarizes the FIRR all the cases tested. The overall FIRR for the \nfour subprojects is 15.4%. As the FIRRs for the sample subprojects as a whole and each of the \nsubprojects are above the WACC, the project is financially viable.  \n \nTable A16.2: FIRR Values for Base Case and Sensitivity Analysis Cases, %  \n \nKeonjhar- Bhatapara- Gooty- Mahanadi \nScenario  Tomka  Urkura  Pullampet  Bridge  Overall \n           \nWeighted Average Cost of Capital  6.8  7.6  5.4  5.8  6.5 \nBase Case  9.8  22.0  11.2  22.3  15.4 \nSensitivity Tests           \n  (i)  Construction Costs 10% Higher  7.4  20.0  9.6  20.7  14.1 \n  (ii)  Benefits 10% Lower  5.0  17.7  8.4  18.8  12.0 \n  (iii)  O&M Costs 10% Higher  6.3  20.0  10.0  20.5  13.7 \n  (iv)  Construction Period 1 Year Longer  7.9  19.8  10.2  20.8  14.8 \n  (v)  (iii) and (iv) Combined  6.1  21.7  9.3  19.2  13.2 \n \n11.

Introduction  \n1.  The  India  Railway  Sector  Improvement  Project  (RSIP)  involves  construction  and \ndoubling of four subprojects in the first phase of project preparation and implementation. These \nare: (i) Tomka-Keonjhar new railway line (96 km); (ii) double tracking of Pullampet-Gooty (154 \nkm);  (iii)  adding  a  third  track  on  Bhatapara-Urkura  (60  km);  and  (iv)  construction  of  the \nMahanadi River second  bridge (2.1 km). The social analysis and resettlement plans for the \nsubprojects  have  been  prepared  following  the  Land  Acquisition  Act  (1894)  and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) policy on involuntary resettlement (1995).  \n \n2.  This framework  has been prepared for additional subprojects as required under ADB \npolicy.  The  framework  outlines  the  policy  and  procedures  for  preparation  of  subsequent \nsubprojects under the sector loan. The  special purpose vehicle (SPV) will be responsible to \nprepare social analysis and resettlement plans for additional subprojects as outlined in this \nframework and submit them to ADB for review and approval.  \n \nB.  Resettlement Policy and Framework  \n3.  The  current  legislation  governing  land  acquisition  for  public  purposes  is  the  Land \nAcquisition Act of 1894. In accordance with the Act, the legal process for land acquisition is \ninitiated by the project-sponsors/SPV to the District Collector (DC) of the respective district. \nAccording to the \u201ccircle rate\u201d used by the DC, the assessed value of land is considered the \nreplacement value for properties. However, the Act of 1894 or state policies (where available) \ndo not address social and economic impacts of land acquisition and resettlement. \n \n4.  ADB  policy  requires  (i)  avoidance  or  minimization  of  impacts  where  possible; \n(ii) consultation  with  affected  people  in  project  planning  and  implementation,  including \ndisclosure  of  resettlement  plan  (RP)  and  project-related  information;  (iii)  payment  of \ncompensation for acquired assets at the market/replacement value; (iv) resettlement assistance \nto  affected  people,  including  non-titled  persons  (e.g.,  informal  dwellers/squatters,  and \nencroachers;  (v)  special  attention  to  vulnerable  people  and/groups;  and  (vi)  an  income \nrestoration and rehabilitation program. Since compensation and rehabilitation based on the Act \nof  1894  and  state  policies  do  not  meet  these  requirements,  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary \nresettlement will be applied for additional subprojects.  \n \n5.  The framework reflects the borrower\u2019s land acquisition laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s \npolicy on involuntary resettlement and other social safeguard guidelines. It stipulates eligibility \nand provisions for all types of losses (land, crops/trees, structures, business/employment, and \nworkdays/wages). Since land for land may not be a feasible option, the affected persons will be \ncompensated at full replacement cost. Affected households to be compensated by the DC, \nfollowing  the  Act  of  1894,  for  lost  assets  will  receive  additional  cash  grants  and  other \nresettlement  assistance  such  as  a  shifting  allowance,  and  compensation  for  loss  of \nworkdays/income  due  to  dislocation.  Female-headed  households  and  other  vulnerable \nhouseholds will be eligible for further cash assistance for relocation and house reconstruction. \nTable A17 presents a general entitlement matrix that would apply to additional subprojects, \nbased on specific project impacts.  \n ", "     Appendix  17           59 \nTable A17: Entitlement Matrix \n \nDefinition  Expected \nType of Loss  Application  of APs  Entitlement  Results \n1.

Procedures for Resettlement Plan Preparation  \n6.  The additional subprojects RP will be prepared as follows: (i) the SPV to carry out social \nimpact assessment surveys for identified subprojects, based on preliminary technical designs; \n(ii) if impacts are found to be significant, the SPV will prepare full RPs for each subprojects; and ", "60  Appendix 17 \n(iii) if subproject impacts are less than significant, short RPs will be sufficient for project \npreparation. SPV consultants for preparatory studies will include expert resettlement specialist \nfamiliar with ADB policy and procedures for preparation of additional subprojects RPs. The RPs \nmust  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  other  social  safeguard \nguidelines. RPs  for  the  sample  subprojects  will  be  used  as  models  for  preparation  and \nimplementation of additional subprojects.  \n \nD.  Institutional Responsibilities  \n7.  For subproject RPs, the SPV will have overall coordination, planning, implementation \nand financing responsibilities. The SPV fully recognizes the complexity of the resettlement \nelement in the Project. Therefore, experienced nongovernment organizations (NGOs) will be \nhired for RP to assist implementation with clearly defined tasks, including community-based \nsocial development  programs as appropriate. A senior SPV official at the rank of executive \nengineer will be appointed as chief resettlement officer to supervise the implementation work. \nThe appointed NGO will open field offices and will involve affected persons, including women, in \nthe implementation process.  \n \n8.   The SPV will ensure that the NGO responsible for RP preparation for subprojects is \naware  of  the  framework  and  procedures  for  resettlement  planning  so  that  appropriate \nentitlements and mitigation measures are established in the RP. The SPV will further ensure \nthat resettlement budgets are delivered on time to the DC office and to the implementing NGOs \nfor timely RP implementation.  \n \nE.  Disclosure, Consultation, and Grievances  \n9.  Each RP will be prepared and implemented in close consultation with the stakeholders \nand will involve focus group discussions and meetings, particularly with the project-affected \npeople. This RP framework will be made available in local language(s) during  focus group \ndiscussions and meetings at the village/community level. Copies of draft RPs will be available at \nthe local level to stakeholders for local inputs. Complaints and grievance procedures will be \noutlined in each RP and grievance redress committees (GRCs) will be established for each \nsubproject  with  representation  from  the  SPV,  APs,  women/  vulnerable  groups,  local \ngovernment, and NGOs. The chief resettlement officer will chair the GRC. Other than disputes \nrelating to ownership rights under the court of law, the GRC will review grievances involving all \nresettlement benefits, relocation, and other assistance. Grievances will be redressed within 2-4 \nweeks from the date of lodging the complaint.  \n \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n10.  The  SPV  will  establish  a  quarterly  monitoring  system  involving  the  SPV  and \nimplementing  NGO  staff,  and  prepare  progress  reports  on  all  aspects  of  land \nacquisition/resettlement and social development activities. The monitoring consultants, to be \nhired by the SPV in concurrence with ADB, will monitor the implementation of the RP and will \nprovide ADB with quarterly reports on the status of RP implementation.  \n ", "        Appendix 18         61 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The proposed Project is categorized as a \u201cB\u201d project in accordance with  the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Environmental Assessment Requirements.1 An initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) was prepared. This summary IEE is based on the information in the IEE \nreports submitted by the Ministry of Railways (MOR).  \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n2.  The four sample subprojects of the proposed Project will involve investment to increase \nthe capacity of existing railways by adding second and third tracks; establish a second bridge \nparallel to an existing railway bridge; and establish a new line. The location of the sample \nsubprojects and their scope are as follows:  \n \nNo.  Sample Subproject  Location  Scope \n1  Establishment second track connecting  Cuddapah and  \u2022  Establish a new embankment \nPullampet-Gooty (150 km), which consists of  Ananthapur districts  and 24 major bridges parallel to \nthree sections:  of Andhra Pradesh  existing railway track.  \n   Pullampet-Bhakrapat (43.4 km)  state  \u2022  Track linking \n   Cuddapah-Muddanuru (55.2 km)  \u2022  Laying ties (sleepers), ballast, \n   Kondapurram-Rayalacheruvu (52.4 km)a  and rails \n \n2  Establish third track connecting Bhatapara- Raipur district of  \u2022  Establish a new embankment \nUkura (60 km)  Chattisgarh state  and five major bridges parallel \nto existing railway track  \n\u2022  Link the track \n\u2022  Laying ties, ballast, and rails \n\u2022  Electric work \n \n3  Establish second bridge at Cuttack (2.1 km) on  Orissa state  \u2022  Establish pier (32) with well \nMahanadi River  foundation and parallel to the \nexisting bridge \n\u2022  Track linking \n\u2022  Laying ties \n \n4  Establish a new railway track connecting  Jhajpur and  \u2022  Establish a new embankment \nDaitari-Keonjhar (96 km)3  Keonjhar district of  (at present about 70% of the \nOrissa state  embankment is completed) \n\u2022  Track linking \n\u2022  Laying ties, ballast, and rails \n \na The section between Bhakrapat-Chuddapah and Muddanuru-Kondapurram is completed. \n  \nC.  Description of the Environment \n3.  The environmental condition of the project areas of influence is briefly summarized as \nfollows: \n \n(i)  Pullampet-Gooty. This track is part of Madras-Raichur (north-west line) of South \nCentral Railway, connecting western India and Maharashtra to the southern part of \nIndia  including  the  states  of  Karnataka,  Tamil  Nadu,  and  Kerala.  The  area \n                                                 \n1  The investment component is not subject of the environmental impact assessment regulation of the Government. \n2   \n3  This new track is part of Baspani-Tomka railway track (335 km). The summary initial environmental examination of \nBaspani-Tomka was circulated to the ADB\u2019s Board of Directors on 20 August 1998.  \n ", "62  Appendix 18   \ntraversed by this railway is topographically flat. The railway alignment passes \nmainly through agricultural land. The soil conditions are clay, loam, and sand with \nfine  distinctions.  The  alignment  passes  three  rivers (Cheyyeru, Papagni, and \nChitravati). The groundwater is very limited and water yielding is very low. The \nrecorded maximum rainfall in the last  2 years was 482  millimeters (mm). The \nproject area is not located nearby or within conservation or sensitive areas. About \n1,046 trees are expected to be cut for establishing the second track.  \n \n(ii)  Bhatapara-Ukura. This track is an important part of Howrah-Mumbai route on the \nsouth-eastern  railway.  The  area  is  topographically  flat.  The  ground  water \navailability is very poor. However, the maximum rainfall recorded is 1,162 mm and \nthe minimum is 743 mm. The track alignment mostly passes through agricultural \nland  and  no  settlement.  The  Kharun  River  is  the  only  river  passed  by  the \nalignment. The project area  is  not  located  nearby  or  within  conservation  or \nsensitive areas. About 1,196 trees are expected to be cut for establishing the third \ntrack.   \n \n(iii)  Cuttack Bridge on Mahanadi River. This is part of a larger project to add a \nsecond track from Talcher to Paradeep port. The recorded annual rainfall of the \narea is 2,111 mm. From November to April there is no rain and the river is dry. \nFrom May to October, the river carries a large volume of water and the water level \nrises. No economic activities rely on the river. It is not part of the inland water \ntransport system. The common groundwater structures are dug wells and hand-\npumps. There are no endangered aquatic species in the area. The project area is \nnot located nearby or within conservation or sensitive areas. \n \n(iv)  Daitari (Tomka)-Keonjhar. This track is to connect the mineral-producing belt of \nOrissa with Paradeep port. It is the responsibility of the south-eastern railway. The \nalignment traverses barren land, forest area, and agricultural land occupied by \nlarge villages and numerous hamlets. The terrain mostly consists of rocky and \nrugged areas, and steep hill slopes. The alignment crosses the Baitarani River, the \nlargest river in the area. It also crosses the Machkdana, Kalinjar, Musal, and Kusia \nrivers. Almost every year in the rainy season the rivers are in flood. Forest areas \naccount for about 30% of the state of Orissa, and 50% of Keonjhar district. Forests \nin Keonjhar district are poor in quality because of the impact of mineral prospecting \nand exploration. To minimize  the impact on forests, the proposed alignment is \nlocated in the foothills of the forest area.4 The project area is not located nearby or \nwithin conservation or sensitive areas. \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n4.  Screening of potential impacts identified that there will be no significant environmental \nimpact. Three of the four sample subprojects are to add track to existing lines, and only one \nsubproject will introduce a new line. The new line is not located in an environmentally sensitive \narea. \n \n                                                 \n4  The Daitari (Tomka)-Keonjhar subproject as part of the Banspani-Tomka project, originally having a length of \n155 km. On the advice of the Ministry of Forest and Environment, the line was realigned between kms 123 to 155 \nto avoid deep forest areas.  \n ", "        Appendix 18         63 \n5.  The  earthworks,  particularly  the  establishment  of  the  embankment,  will  cause \nenvironmental impacts associated with construction. These will include (i) disruption of the water \nsystem due to cut and filling and other earth works; (ii) increased air pollution due to higher dust \nlevels; (iii) noise and vibration; (iv) potential erosion and landslides due to elevation of some part \nof the embankment; and (v) impacts due to disposal of construction waste. These impacts will \nonly occur during the construction period. In the case of the new line, in the absence of \nmitigation measures the construction work would disrupt the water system and cause serious \nsecondary  impacts  (e.g.,  malaria  due  to  stagnant  water  becoming  a  breeding  ground  for \nmosquitoes, and reduced agricultural production due to water logging).  \n \n6.  The proposed mitigation measures will minimize the identified adverse impacts. These \nwill include:  \n \n(i)  mitigation measures to minimize disruption to the water system for the second and \nthird track and bridge will involve: (a) providing a proper temporary diversion and \npumping out the water; and (b) no disposal of waste from workers and construction \ninto the water system;  \n(ii)  mitigation measures to minimize disruption of the water system for the new railway \ntrack will be done by: (a) providing proper diversion of canals, nullahs, and small \nrivers to the nearest water course before starting any embankment works; and (b) \nno disposal of waste from workers and construction into the water system; \n(iii)  mitigation measures to reduce dust during construction will be done by maintaining \nthe moisture content to at least 15%; \n(iv)  land stabilization will be established for any embankment with slope more than 30 \ndegrees to minimize landslide problems; \n(v)  proper sanitation schemes will be adopted to deal with domestic waste generated \nby temporary worker camps to minimize impacts due to disposal; \n(vi)  to minimize disposal of materials from construction works, a balanced approach to \ncutting and filling will be adopted; and \n(vii)  to minimize disruption of traffic due to mobilization of construction materials and \nmachinery, proper road signs will be developed in consultation with the local traffic \nauthority. If temporary access roads are needed, the contractor will be responsible \nfor rehabilitating the area after finishing construction.   \n7.  The other important impact, which is not directly related to the area of influence of the \nsubprojects, is the impact due to mining of sand and gravel. In this context, the contractor will be \nrequired to ensure that the supply of construction materials is taken from a legal area and that \nproper rehabilitation of the mining area is undertaken. \n \n8.  The environmental impacts associated with the operation of the sample subprojects and \nrequired mitigation measures are (i) increased noise due to an increased number of trains will \nrequire establishing a physical barrier for the track when it passes near schools and hospitals; \nand (ii) increased use of train stations will generate more waste and expend more energy and \nwater resources, and will require proper sanitation to be provided at stations.  \n \n ", "64  Appendix 18   \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program \n9.  An environmental management and monitoring plan was prepared as part of the IEE \nstudies for each subproject. It was recommended that contractual documentation of the bidding \ndocuments  should  clearly  define  environmental  responsibilities  and  penalties  for  non-\ncompliance  of  the  contractor.  The  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  the \nconstruction stage will be the responsibility of the contractor. MOR, supported by the project \ndirector  of  its  implementing  agency for the investment component, will be responsible for \nmonitoring implementation of mitigation measures during the construction stage.5 The Project \nwill also hire a consultant to monitor environmental performance during project implementation. \nTree planting will be carried out by the department of forest of the respective state government, \nwhich may request MOR to assist it in this task. MOR and the implementing agency are \nresponsible for implementing the overall environmental monitoring and management plan to \nmitigate the environmental impacts of this Project. Training for field engineers and trainers will \nbe provided to strengthen the capacity of the engineers in dealing with environmental concerns. \nA set of guidelines will also be developed to assist responsible staff in handling environmental \nproblems associated with railway operations  (e.g., to minimize impacts due to overhaul of \nlocomotives, environmentally friendly operation of train stations, and regarding fuel storage and \nfuel filling stations). These guidelines will be distributed and implemented by the field engineers \nof Indian Railways and the implementing agency.  \n  \nF.  Finding and Recommendations \n10.  The IEE shows that the sample subprojects will contribute to lower traffic congestion and \nreduced pollution associated with vehicle emissions. The IEE confirms that the areas affected \nby the sample subprojects are not environmentally sensitive, and recommends measures to \nmitigate the potential negative environmental impacts. On this basis, a full environmental impact \nassessment study  is  not  required.  Assurance  was  obtained  from  MOR  that  all  mitigation \nmeasures will be implemented and no civil works carried out before receiving the clearance for \ntree cutting from the Department of Forest. MOR agreed to undertaken periodic monitoring of \nenvironmental impacts and mitigation measures.  \n  \nG.  Conclusion \n11.  The overall finding of the IEE is that the sample subprojects will not cause significant \nenvironmental  problems,  and  that  the  potential  adverse  impacts  are  manageable.  These \nimpacts will not affect any environmentally sensitive areas, and therefore a full environmental \nimpact assessment study is not required. The environmental management and monitoring plans \nare  sufficiently  detailed  and  provides  enforceable  actions  to  be  undertaken  by  MOR  for \nmitigating the impacts, and maintaining environmental quality during the operational stage. \n \n                                                 \n5  MOR will establish a wholly owned special-purpose vehicle under the Companies Act, which will act as  the \nimplementing agency for the investment component of the Project. \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R324-02 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20021129152448Z", "Title": "R324-02", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 4.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20030205151444+08'00'"}}
