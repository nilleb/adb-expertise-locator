The  Government  of  the  Philippines  recognizes  the  need  to  develop  the  small  and\nmedium enterprise (SME)1 sector to reduce poverty by generating employment, enhancing\nworker competence and productivity, and achieving a more equitable distribution of income.\nTherefore, the Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) during the 2002\ncountry programming mission to provide technical assistance (TA) to prepare a development\nprogram for accelerating SME financing. ADB fielded the Reconnaissance Mission on 5\u20136\nAugust 2002, and Fact-Finding Mission on 14\u20138 October 2002. This TA paper is based on the\nunderstanding reached with the Government on the TA\u2019s objectives, scope, financing, and\nimplementation  arrangements.  The  TA  also  incorporates  the  views  expressed  by  various\nstakeholders.2 Appendix 1 presents the preliminary program framework.\nII. ISSUES\n2. The SME sector is a primary source of growth of the Philippine economy. Together with\nmicroenterprises, SMEs\u2019 value added contribution to the national economy is 32%, absorbing\n67% of the total labor force nationwide. A vibrant SME sector can help reduce poverty through\nemployment generation. The Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) 2001\u20132004\nof the Government focuses on developing SMEs to combat poverty. A summary initial poverty\nand social analysis is in Appendix 2. With the uncertainties surrounding the global economy in\nthe wake of the terrorist attack on the United States in 2001, the Government seeks to promote\neconomic growth led by domestic demand, and regards the development of the SME sector as\na key to such a strategy.\n3. The Government also recognizes that  one of the most severe constraints facing the\nSMEs is the limited access to financing for their working capital and capital investment needs.\nAccess to finance is difficult to SMEs despite the fact that the current banking system is highly\nliquid. The current status of overall liquidity of the Philippine banking system is shown by the\nbanking sector\u2019s aggregate loan-to-deposit ratio, which declined from 91.3% in 1999 to 82.0% in\n2001. During this period, total deposits grew by 8.95% while loans grew by only 1.2%. Slow\ngrowth in loans was caused partly by the reduced financing needs for business expansion in the\neconomy, and mostly by the reluctance of banks to lend particularly to SMEs in the face of\nincreasing nonperforming loans (NPLs);3 tightened risk assessment of banks in response to the\nstricter prudential requirement of the Central Bank of the Philippines (BSP), in line with the best\ninternational practices; and a general tendency of financial conservativeness.\n4. Bank credit has been the primary source of funding to SMEs, especially since Executive\nOrder 138 became effective in 1999.4 Over 80% of the credit provided by the banking sector to\nSMEs is sourced from commercial banks, followed by 13% from thrift banks and 5% from rural\nbanks.5 Recognizing the banking sector\u2019s dominance in SME finance and the need to facilitate\nbanks to accelerate their lending to SMEs, the President\u2019s Office chairs regular discussions with\nBSP,  the  Department  of  Trade  and  Industry  (DTI),  the  Department  of  Finance  (DOF),\n                                                \n1  According to Republic Act 8289, a SME is defined as any business activity or enterprise whose total assets,\nexclusive of land: less than P1.5 million for micro enterprise,P1.5 million \u2013 P15.0 million for a small enterprise, and\nover P15.0 million \u2013 P100.0 million for a medium enterprise.\n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 5 July 2002.\n3  The NPL ratio in the banking sector rose from 5.4% in 1999 to 16.9% in 2001.\n4  Executive Order 138 set a new Government policy to consolidate government credit programs to be operated by\ngovernment financial institutions through private sector banks as conduits in lending on market-based terms.\n5  As of March 2002, there were 44 commercial banks; 100 thrift banks comprising 32 savings and mortgage banks,\n34 private development banks, 32 stock savings and loan associations, and 2 microfinance institutions; and 781\nrural banks. (Source: BSP)", "2\ngovernment financial institutions, and private sector banks in its efforts to synchronize the public\nand private initiatives to increase finance for SMEs.\n5. Banks generally regard SME lending as potentially a promising business opportunity.\nLarge banks face fierce competition in the corporate lending market with foreign banks and\namong themselves as financial globalization has deepened. Prominent SME businesses could\nbe important for banks for growth potential and risk diversification. Successful smaller banks\nhave relied on the development of their traditional SME clientele for their own growth and have\nupgraded services to their customers. The development of the SME sector is strategically\nimportant to banks as well as to the national economy.\n6. One of the constraints to banks\u2019 lending to SMEs stems from the current prudential\nrequirements of BSP. Under the BSP regulations, NPLs are defined as loans with principal\nand/or interest unpaid for 30 days or more after due date. However, even if a current loan is\ncategorized as NPL by the definition, it can still be restructured in various ways, typically by\nextending the repayment period to better correspond to the borrower\u2019s future cash flow. In such\na case, additional financing for working capital to match the projected cash flow may be needed.\nThis will help keep the newly restructured loan current. The current BSP regulations, however,\nrequire a provision to be made for the possible loss of a new loan in addition to the provision on\nthe original NPL. While these safeguards help enhance the soundness of the banking sector,\nthey also discourage banks\u2019 willingness to restructure a loan that faces temporary difficulty in\nmeeting  debt  service  obligations.  To  enhance  credit  flow  to  SMEs,  the  current  prudential\nrequirements need to be adjusted so as to rely more on credit assessment of loan accounts by\neach bank and to the extent that BSP can maintain the integrity of bank loan portfolios through\ntight supervision.\n7. Republic Act 6977 (as amended by Republic Act 8289), commonly known as the Magna\nCarta for Small Enterprises, requires each bank to lend at least 6.0% of its netlending portfolio\nto  small  enterprises  and  2.0%  to  medium  enterprises.  Currently,  these  requirements  are\nexceeded on an aggregate basis.6  However,  at  the  level  of  each  financial  institution,  the\nusefulness of this mandatory credit allocation is questionable because it may restrict banks\u2019\ncredit decisions based on their own risk assessments and erode the quality of their loan\nportfolios, deterring the smooth flow of credit to SMEs. Another shortcoming is general non-\ncompliance of this requirement by small banks. Most small-scale thrift banks and rural banks\nfind it extremely difficult to lend to medium enterprises, which are not included in their inherent\ncustomer bases. As a result, they opt to pay a fine to BSP as the penalty for noncompliance\nwith the required lending to medium enterprises, and treat the fine as part of the operational\ncosts.7 The Small and Medium Enterprise Development Council (SMEDC) established under the\nMagna Carta for Small Enterprises is currently reviewing the provisions of the law in line with\nthe banking liberalization. SMEDC needs help to review the requirements and revise the Magna\nCarta for Small Enterprises to enhance the flow of market-based credit to SMEs.\n8. Banks tend to avoid lending to an SME with no clear business plan and  financial\nstatements. The higher risk in lending to such an SME increases the financing cost to the\nborrower. It is important to strengthen SMEs\u2019 capacity and skills in preparing viable business\nplans, and to help them better understand the importance of loan documentation, financial\nmanagement,  managerial  skills,  and  human  resource  development.  To  promote  bankable\n                                                \n6  As of March 2002, commercial banks loans accounted for 15.27% to small and 9.83% to medium enterprises. Thrift\nbank loans accounted for 27.53% to small and 32.54% to medium enterprises. Rural banks loans accounted for\n32.54% to small and 10.83% to medium enterprises. (Source: BSP)\n7  Section 14 of the Magna Carta refers to the penalties, including a fine of no less than P500,000, for noncompliance\nwith the provisions of this act.", "3\nprojects, business skills of SME entrepreneurs, managers, and workers need to be enhanced.\nNationwide availability of business development services (BDSs) would help SMEs\u2019 improved\naccess to needed financing. In this connection, collaboration with a BDSs provider and bank\ncredit officers should be strengthened and encouraged. DTI SME development centers in 73\nprovinces can support this initiative in coordination with the private sector financiers and BDS\nproviders, including local chambers of commerce.\n9. Another constraint on lending to SMEs is the lack of credit information. To help banks\novercome the difficulty in providing credit to SMEs, the Government-owned Small Business\nGuarantee and Finance Corporation (SBC) has successfully facilitated SME financing through\nits guarantee and financing operations, contributing to an increase in the number of \u201cbankable\u201d\nSME businesses since it was established in 1991. Cumulatively, SBC has provided more than\nP8.2 billion in credit guarantees. To help SMEs finance working capital by discounting their\nacquired promissory notes, SBC facilitated under its Rediscounting Facility, credit amounting\ncumulatively to  P4.7  billion  and  benefiting  3,311  SMEs.  All  this  information  needs  to  be\ndisseminated to banks to form the nucleus of a credit information system. However, the SBC is\nfar from meeting all the needs of SMEs for credit enhancement and working capital financing\nbecause of its institutional and capacity constraints. To assist SME exporters to increase their\nexports and facilitate imports of inputs, the Government-owned Philippine Export-Import Credit\nAgency (PhilEXIM) has introduced trade financing facilities, including the preshipment export\nfinancing  guarantee  and  postshipment  export  risk  guarantee.  However,  PhilEXIM  has  not\nfulfilled its mandate to fully support SME exporters because of its limited institutional capacity\nand resources. Strengthening of credit supplementation and alternative financing schemes\nprovided by these Government financial institutions is urgently needed to accelerate credit to\nSMEs through institutional capacity building and the development of new financial products that\nmeet the financing needs of SMEs.\n10. A series of consultations have been held between  ADB\u2019s other funding agencies and\nDTI on the possible approach of ADB assistance to the development of SMEs. The World\nBank\u2019s SME development assistance, along with Japan Bank for International Cooperation\n(JBIC), is focused on the provision of a credit line to finance SMEs\u2019 capital investment. The\nInternational Finance Corporation, with ADB and the Netherlands Development Corporation,\ninvested equity in Planters Development Bank, the largest SME bank.  German Development\nCorporation (KfW) and ADB have provided credit lines for micro-, small and medium enterprises\nin rural areas. German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) is providing a comprehensive\nprivate sector development assistance package to DTI, covering the Visayas region. The Japan\nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  plans  to  help  DTI  formulate  a  long-term  SME\ndevelopment strategy. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) has provided\nTA for private sector development focusing on SMEs. None of the funding agencies has\nhowever provided assistance directly focusing on the acceleration of SME financing through\nimproved  credit  policy  framework,  credit  supplementation  such  as  credit  guarantee  and\nguarantees to export-import financing, and provision of working capital requirements of SMEs.\nADB will coordinate with other funding agencies during the finalization of the scope of the\nproposed assistance and its implementation.\n11. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update for the Philippines 2003\u20132005 aims at (i)\nreducing poverty, (ii) promoting equitable growth, (iii) improving social services delivery, (iv)\nprotecting the environment, and (v) promoting good governance. These objectives are closely\naligned  with  the  strategic  goals  of  the  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan  of  the\nGovernment, which advocates developing SMEs as one of its main strategies for poverty\nreduction. The poverty partnership agreement between ADB and the Government calls for credit", "4\nsupport for SMEs in partnership with the private sector to encourage broad-based growth and\nequitable development.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Purpose and Output\n12. The  purpose  of  the  TA  is  to  develop  a  program  to  increase  finance  to  SMEs  by\nimproving policy and regulatory requirements for SME finance, assisting the Government in its\nefforts to spread BDSs nationwide, and enhancing Government financial and credit institutions\u2019\nabilities to increase financial support to SMEs.\n13. The TA will provide necessary inputs for joint formulation of the ensuing program with\nstakeholders,  including  BSP,  business  chambers,  DOF,  DTI,  financing  agencies,  financial\ninstitutions, PhilEXIM, SBC, and SMEs. The inputs needed will be determined based on in-\ndepth analysis of the constraints to the SME financing, including a thorough review of the BSP\u2019s\nprudential regulations on SME finance, the provisions of the Magna Carta for Small Enterprises,\na survey of the BDSs most needed by SMEs, and the analysis of the organization and operation\nof the Government credit and credit supplementation institutions.\nB.  Scope\n14. The results of the following TA activities will be disseminated among policy makers and\nfinancial practitioners, in order to increase their awareness of the need for accelerating SME\nfinancing. They are in turn expected to make an active contribution to the TA output through\nworkshops and forums including the SME financing summit meeting to be hosted by SBC under\nDTI in June 2003, and policy and technical discussions to be conducted under the TA.\n15. Regulatory Constraints to the SME Financing. The TA will examine the constraints\nthat banks face in providing credit to SMEs. Based on the findings, the TA will seek options for\nrevised banking regulatory procedures to facilitate SMEs\u2019 access to finance. The options will be\nwithin the prudential norms and international best practices as envisaged under the latest Bank\nfor International Settlement guidelines, and will take into account the current SME financing\nneeds in the Philippines. The provisions of the Magna Carta for Small Enterprises will be\nthoroughly reviewed and revisions recommended to better respond to SME lending by banks.\n16. Business Development Services.  Under  the  TA,  currently  operating  and  planned\ninitiatives  for  DTI\u2019s  BDSs  that  are  based  on  commercial  principles  and  private-public\npartnerships, will be reviewed in detail. Such initiatives include  capacity  building  and  skills\ndevelopment to prepare  bankable business plans,8 financial management, managerial skills,\napplication  of  the  latest  information  and  communication  technology,  and  human  resource\ndevelopment. Based on the study, the best way to integrate BDSs into SME financing will be\nevaluated for inclusion in the ensuing program.\n17. Government Credit and Credit Supplementation Institutions. Through an in-depth\nanalysis, the TA will determine the key elements for successful credit guarantee schemes and\nother  credit  supplementation  institutions,  based  on  the  comparative  study  of  the  facilities,\noperation, and effectiveness of credit supplementation in the region. A survey will be conducted\nto  analyze  SMEs\u2019  demand  for  credit  and  credit  supplementation,  targeting  SME  financing\ninstitutions  and  SMEs.  Based  on  the  results  of  the  survey,  options  for  appropriate  SME\n                                                \n8  Bankable means satisfactory to bankers in providing credit to a business due to prospects for positive future cash\nflow, business growth and stability, good management, sound financial management, etc.", "5\nfinancing schemes to be funded by the proposed loan will be presented for further discussion\nwith the stakeholders including BSP, DOF, DTI, and potential SME borrowers. The scope,\nfinancing schemes and implementation arrangements for the proposed program will be finalized\nto best cater to the development of the SME credit and credit supplementation. The TA will also\nrecommend sustainable credit supplementation schemes for the long term.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n18. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $575,000 equivalent, comprising $270,000 in\nforeign exchange costs and $305,000 equivalent in local currency costs.  The Government has\nrequested ADB to finance $400,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and\n$130,000 equivalent of local currency costs. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis\nfrom the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance\nthe remaining $175,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. Details of the cost and financing\nplan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not\ncommit ADB to provide any proposed loan.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n19. DTI will be the Executing Agency. DTI\u2019s Industry and Investments Group will have\noverall responsibility for supervising the TA implementation. The TA project advisory committee,\nchaired by the secretary of DTI and comprising  Small and Medium Enterprise Development\nCouncil, BSP, DOF, National Economic Development Authority (NEDA), SBC and PhilEXIM will\nbe involved in formulating the program.\n20. The  TA  will  require  about  8  person-months  of  international  consulting  services,\ncomprising expertise in SME finance policy, banking supervision, SME finance, SME business\ndevelopment services, and financial analysis. The international consultants will associate with\ndomestic consultants who will provide about 15 person-months of expertise in SME finance,\nlaw,  taxation,  SME  BDSs,  and  financial  analysis.  A  consulting  firm  will  be  selected  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants, through the biodata-based selection and\non quality and cost based arrangements. The TA will be implemented over 8 months, to\ncommence in January 2003 and finish in August 2003. The outline terms of reference for the TA\nconsultants are attached in Appendix 4.\nIV.

Overview\n1. The technical assistance (TA) will help develop an integrated strategy for accelerating\ncredit to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This is achievable through (i) in-depth review of\nthe banking regulation relating to SME financing and the efficiency of the provisions of the\nMagna Carta for Small Enterprises, (ii) seeking options for the effective harmonization between\nthe efforts in building capacity of SMEs and the banks\u2019 lending to SMEs, and (iii) designing the\nassistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the SME credit and credit supplementation.\nB. Policy and Regulatory Review\n2. The  TA  will  analyze  banks\u2019  SME  lending  operations  and  examine  regulatory\nrequirements imposed by the current Central Bank of the Philippines (BSP) prudential norm, the\nlending policy of the Monetary Board (BSP\u2019s policy making body), and the Magna Carta for\nSmall Enterprises. The study results will be disseminated through workshops, among policy\nmakers representing BSP, Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Department of Finance,\nNational Economic Development Authority,  government  financial  institutions,  private  sector\nbanks, and other stakeholders for the further discussion and to recommend amendments to the\ncurrent SME financing policy and regulations. Such recommendations will take into a due\naccount the best international prudential practices and the current SME financing needs in the\nPhilippines and keep a good balance between them. A survey will be conducted to find credit\ndemand from SMEs as a base for the recommendation.\nC.  Business Development Services\n3. The TA will review in detail (i) commercially operating business development services\n(BDSs) to SMEs, (ii) DTI\u2019s initiative for the development of such services, and (iii) BDSs\noperated in a private-public partnership. It will examine the effectiveness and efficiency of these\nbusiness development services, and seek new methodologies for integrating them into the\nlending  to  SMEs,  to  facilitate  SMEs\u2019  access  to  the  needed  finance.  The  application  of\ninformation and communication technology to the BDSs will also be examined. A survey will be\nconducted to determine the demand for various BDSs, the same time as the survey for credit\ndemand as a base for the recommended new methodologies.\nD.  Small and Medium Enterprise Credit and Credit Supplementation\n4. The TA will make a comparative study of the credit guarantee schemes and other credit\nsupplementation institutions in the region, including the Philippines, to find the current status of\ndevelopment in terms of scale, institutional capacity, and operation of the SME credit and credit\nsupplementation schemes in the Philippines. In particular, the TA will thoroughly review the\ninstitutional, operational, and financial status of the two Government-owned credit and credit\nsupplementation institutions, i.e., Small Business Guarantee and Finance Corporation (SBC)\nand Philippine Export-Import Credit Agency (PhilEXIM), as the candidates for the recipients of\nthe proposed ADB loan. A survey will be conducted, in concurrence with the survey for credit\ndemand and demand for BDSs, to determine the demand for SME credit guarantee, alternative\nfinancing such as credit against receivables, export-import credit guarantees, and discounting\nfacilities as a base for designing appropriate SME financing schemes to be funded by the\nproposed ADB loan.", "10 Appendix 4\nE.
