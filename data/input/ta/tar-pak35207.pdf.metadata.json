Despite Pakistan\u2019s long history of public sector development programs, the country\u2019s \nproject  implementation  capacity  continues  to  remain  weak,  leading  to  delayed  project \ncompletion and ineffective use of aid resources. Following an agreement reached during the \n2001 Country Portfolio Review Mission (CPRM) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the \nGovernment has requested ADB technical assistance (TA) to identify the weaknesses in the \nportfolio management and monitoring system, help streamline the procedures, and strengthen \nthe capacity for effective portfolio monitoring. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country strategy and \nprogram  for  2002.  The  TA  Fact-Finding  Mission,  fielded  in  August  2002,  reached  an \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  scope,  terms  of  reference,  and \nimplementation arrangements for the TA1. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.     ADB\u2019s Medium-Term Country Strategy for Pakistan (2002\u20132006) is based on overarching \ndevelopment objective of poverty reduction, long-term strategic framework, and lessons learned \nfrom experience in Pakistan. The incidence of poverty in Pakistan has increased from 26.6% in \nFY1993 to 32.2% in FY1999, and the number of poor people has increased by over 12 million \nduring this period. The incidence of poverty is estimated to be significantly higher today than in \n1998-1999 due to slow economic growth and a severe drought for two years. The key areas of \nADB\u2019s strategic priorities are sustainable pro-poor growth, inclusive of social development, and \ngood governance. The major focus of the ADB strategy is to build the capacity of governance \ninstitutions and promote efficient and effective use of available resources.     \n \n3.  Inadequate  Portfolio  Management  Capacity.  The  Government's  development \ninvestment program has increased substantially over the years, both in terms of finance and \nnumber of projects in the portfolio. The PSDP allocation for FY2002 amounts to Rs130 billion \n(equivalent  to  $2.10  billion)  for  over  600  projects.  The  composition  of  the  portfolio  has \nsignificantly changed in terms of sector priorities, with focus on poverty reduction, governance, \nsocial development, and beneficiary and stakeholder participation. As a result, the capacity \nproblem has become the most serious factor constraining line ministries and executing agencies \nfrom effectively implementing projects and meeting their development objectives.   \n \n4.  The PSDP is largely funded by external agencies. From the start of ADB lending \noperations to Pakistan in 1968 through 31 December 2001, ADB has approved 183 public \nsector loans totaling $11.45 billion. As of 31 May 2002, ADB\u2019s portfolio consisted of 49 active \nloans with an undisbursed balance of $4.2 billion. ADB's annual lending to Pakistan increased \nsubstantially over the last two years, and was $710.0 million in 2000 and $956.8 million in 2001, \nagainst an average of $500 million to $600 million in the past. The 2002 lending program is \nexpected reach $1.0 billion and the pipeline for the next 3 years is $2.4 billion, an average of \n$800 million a year.   \n \n5.  Project  Implementation  Delays.  Project  implementation  delays  remain  a  familiar \nfeature  of  ADB\u2019s  portfolio  in  Pakistan.  Most  projects  have  faced  persistent  implementation \nproblems  and  suffered  average  start-up  delays  of  over  2  years  due  to  delays  in  loan \neffectiveness and setting up of the project implementation units. Such long start-up delays \nadversely affect the project implementation schedule and require an average 3 year extension \nof loans to complete projects. Frequent transfers of project directors and other key staff, lack of \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities  (internet version) on 1 October 2002. ", " 2   \n \nqualified staff, poor accountability, and the complex bureaucratic decision-making process also \nseriously affect project implementation. In ADB\u2019s experience, on average, 5 project directors are \nchanged over a project period of 5 - 6 years. The system does not encourage the commitment \nof project directors to accelerate work by proactive steps to minimize delays in contract awards.   \nThe  selection  criteria  for  recruiting  key  project  staff  are  not  based  on  needs  for  project \nmanagement skills and experience. Project directors are in many cases appointed in addition to \ntheir other responsibilities, rather than on a full time basis, and against understandings reached \nat appraisal. \n \n6.  Delays  in  Procurement  and  Consultant  Selection.  Due  to  unfamiliarity  with \nprocurement  procedures  and  lengthy  approval  formalities  within  the  line  ministries  and \ndepartments, contract awards are inordinately delayed. Contract awards for medium-sized \nprocurement take about 21 months, and recruitment of consultants takes 15- 24 months. As a \nresult, annual targets for contract awards and disbursement are not fully achieved, although \ntargets are generally set low taking into account the country\u2019s systemic weaknesses and track \nrecord of underperformance. The average contract awards ratio over the last 5 years (1997\u2013\n2001), was 19.82% against the ADB-wide average of 22.86%. The average disbursement ratio \nduring the same period was, however, slightly better primarily due to fast-disbursing program \nloans. For 2001, total contract awards and disbursement projections were $314.8 million and \n$503.8  million,  respectively.  Against  these  projections,  actual  achievements  amounted  to \n$391.4 (124%) in contract awards, and $512.3 million (102%) in disbursement, including a lump \nsum  amount  under  program  loans  of  contract  awards  valued  at  $299.6  million  and \ndisbursements for $331.9 million. Excluding program loans, actual achievements for contract \nawards and disbursement during 2001 were below the annual projections, accounting for 97% \nand 81% of projections, respectively. Although annual contract awards and disbursements \nimproved recently, the overall performance is not satisfactory given the enhanced assistance \nlevel and long experience of ADB operations in the country.   \n \n7.  Poor Accounting and Auditing. Project accounts are not properly maintained due to \ninadequate capacity among executing agencies, which also affects portfolio performance. Poor \naccounting practices raise questions about irregularities and lack of transparency leading to \ndelays in auditing of project accounts and poor quality of audits. The Audit Office of the Director \nGeneral lacks adequate capacity to audit project accounts and submit audited project accounts, \nand audited project accounts and financial statements are usually delayed. For 2001, only 33% \nof ADB loans had complied fully and on time with requirements for audited project accounts and \nfinancial statements, while 17% had partly or not complied, and complied late 50%. Timely \nsubmission of audit reports and maintenance of high accounting and auditing standards are \nrequired under ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy, and the capacity of project accounts staff and the \nstaff of the Office of the Auditor General needs strengthening to do so.  \n \n8.  Inadequate Attention to Development Impacts. Because of implementation delays, \npoor management, and inadequate attention to cross- cutting policy issues, projects in Pakistan \nare not effective in achieving development impacts.  ADB\u2019s postevaluation findings have shown \nthat the development impact of many completed projects has been much less than anticipated \nand the overall performance of the Pakistan portfolio is not satisfactory when compared to that \nof the ADB-wide portfolio. Based on ADB\u2019s postevaluation findings, as reflected in the project \nperformance audit reports circulated during 1996\u20132001, none of Pakistan\u2019s 19 projects was \nhighly successful, 31.6% were successful, 52.6% were partly successful, and 15.8% were \nunsuccessful,  compared  to  the  ADB-wide performance of  13.8% highly successful, 39.0% \nsuccessful, 33.3% partly successful, and 13.9% unsuccessful. ", "  3\n9.  Weak Monitoring and Evaluation. The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system works \nmainly within the institutional structure of the Federal Planning and Development Division \n(FPDD) through its Project Wing and the provincial planning and development departments or \nboard (PPDDs) through their M&E units. In addition, the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) \nmonitors the foreign-aided projects, and the key line ministries conduct periodic review of \nproject implementation. Although the Project Wing and the M&E units are mandated to carry out \nM&E  work,  they  lack  required  institutional  support,  qualified  staff,  resources,  and  proper \ndirection to function effectively. The current project management information system (MIS) is too \nweak to ensure a constant flow of information on the implementation and portfolio management \nissues to the key Government officials, the Project Wing and EAD at the federal level, and the \nprovincial M&E units. The Project Wing has recently introduced a quarterly progress report on \nprojects  providing  basic  data  and  implementation  progress;  the  reports  are  reviewed \ninterdepartmentally and selected problem projects are discussed at the highest level in the \nGovernment. However, this monitoring system mainly focuses on the financial progress of \nprojects  against  annual  budget  allocations  and  funds  release,  with  little  attention  to \nimplementation  issues  and  remedial  measures  for  achieving  development  objectives  and \nimpacts.  To  improve  the  M&E  system,  the  Project  Wing  plans  to  introduce  a  detailed \nquestionnaire for collecting project data, and institute computerized code for all projects.        \n \n10.  Through regular biannual CPRMs, ADB has raised generic implementation issues to the \nGovernment's attention for remedial steps. Despite specific actions agreed during the CPRMs, \nthe  portfolio  performance  has  not  shown  any  significant  improvement,  particularly  in \ndevelopment  impacts.  Based  on  CPRM  experience,  the  Pakistan  Resident  Mission  has \nundertaken new initiative to improve portfolio performance and close interactions with executing \nagencies in 2001 by quarterly provincial project review meetings which are chaired by the \nprovincial ministers of finance and planning. Similarly, for umbrella projects, quarterly federal \nproject review meetings are held at EAD. The meetings have been effective in discussing \noutstanding project issues and drawing more attention of senior officials to the necessary action.  \nADB also closely coordinates with other external agencies that express concern about delays in \nproject implementation and poor portfolio performance, and stress the need for urgently taking \ncorrective measures. However, the Government and funding agencies have yet to take a broad-\nbased initiative to address this problem, and action has been limited to project- or province-\nspecific efforts.    \n \n11.  The Government recognizes the need to improve portfolio performance and has initiated \nsteps  to  identify  weaknesses  in  the  portfolio  management  and  monitoring  system  and \nrecommend the necessary streamlining and strengthening. The Government, as committed at \nthe Pakistan Development Forum held in Paris in April 2002, has established a high-level task \nforce to examine project implementation issues and recommend measures for effective use of \naid resources. Therefore, the proposed TA is timely and it will reinforce Pakistan Resident \nMission\u2019s efforts through CPRMs, and the quarterly provincial project review meetings and \nfederal project review meetings to sustain improvement in portfolio performance.  \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output   \n12.  The TA will strengthen the portfolio performance and monitoring capacity of the Project \nWing of FPDD and the M&E units and cells of PPDDs and PPDB in four provinces: Balochistan, \nNorth-West Frontier Province (NWFP), Punjab, and Sindh. The TA will help (i) streamline the \nsystem of internal clearances, including synchronizing the Government's project document with ", " 4   \n \nADB loan documents; (ii) improve the efficiency of the system to recruit and retain key project \nstaff  during  project  implementation;  (iii)  expedite  procurement  and  consultant  selection  by \nsimplifying  decision-making  procedures  and  delegation  of  authority;  (iv)  strengthen  the \nmonitoring system of portfolio performance by developing a comprehensive MIS on key project \nactivities for sustained information flow among stakeholders, mainly through the Project Wing at \nthe federal level, and linking the MIS with the provincial M&E units of PPDDs and PPDB; and  \n(v) assign core staff responsibility and provide training to concerned officials for effective \nportfolio monitoring. Given the nature of issues to be addressed and the need to institutionalize \nthe capacity building, a follow-up TA will be required. The main focus of this TA will be to \nstrengthen the capacity of the Project Wing and the M&E units, which would need to be further \ndeepened under a follow-up TA.          \n \n13.  The  TA  will  review  the  Government's  internal  approval  procedures  for  project \nimplementation matters. The weaknesses and reasons for delayed project implementation will \nbe identified, and the required remedial steps taken. The rules and decision-making authorities \non project implementation and related matters will be examined, and necessary modifications \nand improvements recommended and pursued for implementation. The TA will develop a \ncomprehensive data base for key project activities and financial performance to strengthen the \nmonitoring system of FPDD, PPDDs, and PPDB through an effective MIS with appropriate \nnetworking arrangements established for constant flow of information to the those concerned in \nthe decision-making system, including EAD, the line ministries, and departments.  Thus, the TA \nwill integrate the monitoring system with the decision makers at higher levels and those directly \ninvolved  in  project  implementation  for  efficient  portfolio  management  and  improved \nperformance. The TA will identify core staff and logistic support required for the portfolio \nmonitoring system, define their responsibilities, and provide extensive training for capacity \nbuilding within the Project Wing, EAD, the M&E Units at PPDDs and PPDB and key line \nagencies.     \n \n14.  The TA will also provide streamlined project implementation procedures, a strengthened \nmonitoring  system  with  comprehensive  data  base,  a  pool  of  well-trained  core  staff  for \ninternalizing capacity building, and outcome-based portfolio performance monitoring indicators. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.   The  TA  will  be  implemented  by  a  team  of  experienced  international  and  domestic \nconsultants.  The  consultants  will  work  closely  with  the  Government\u2019s  counterpart  staff,  in \nconsultation with the key stakeholders involved in the decision making for and implementation of \nprojects. The consultants work will be closely supervised by ADB, and guided and monitored by \nthe Government through a high-level federal steering committee and provincial coordination \ncommittees. Workshops will be organized to solicit views of the stakeholders at different levels \nof the Government on project implementation and portfolio management issues and agree on \nremedial actions.   \n \n16.  Based on review of existing systems and procedures, the consultants will undertake \nwell-defined and sequenced activities, e.g., (i) a situation analysis including institutional set up; \n(ii) training needs assessment, training manuals on project management and procurement \nmatters, and hands-on-training for concerned staff; (iii) development of simplified project and \nprocurement approval procedures; (iv) development of an MIS and outcome-based monitoring \nindicators; and (v) preparation of an action plan for institutionalizing the MIS and a plan for \nimplementing various recommendations during the TA and after its completion on a sustained \nbasis. ", "  5\n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing  \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $815,000 equivalent comprising a foreign \nexchange cost of $286,000 and a local currency cost of $529,000 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. ADB financing will cover the total \nforeign exchange cost and $364,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will \nfinance the remaining local currency cost of $165,000 equivalent in kind for the items prescribed \nin Appendix 2. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  FPDD will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The implementing agencies will be the \nProject Wing, and PPDDs and PPDB in four provinces. A federal TA steering committee will be \nheaded by the secretary of FPDD, with members from EAD, the Finance Division, lead line \nministries, and the Auditor General\u2019s Office. The committee will meet regularly to provide  \nguidance on TA implementation, and will be responsible for implementing the recommendations \nof the TA.  At the provincial level, a TA coordination committee in each province will be headed \nby the PPDD additional chief secretary, and chairperson of the PPDB, with members from other \nlead departments and agencies.       \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 15 months, and is expected to commence in January \n2003 and be completed in March 2004. FPDD will establish a TA implementation office under its \nProject Wing for overall implementation, coordination, and monitoring of the TA. The office will \nbe headed by federal project director. The PPDDs and PPDB will establish TA implementation \ncells and will appoint a project coordinator to head each cell. In addition, EAD will coordinate the \nTA implementation by interfacing with the TA implementation office and TA implementation cells \nto complement the task force related work on project implementation issues, and will be \nprovided with necessary logistical support. The TA will require the services of one international \nconsultant for a total of 9 person-months for systems streamlining, procurement, and training. \nThe consultant will be the team leader. The domestic consultants will be required for 53 person-\nmonths for project monitoring, procurement, MIS, and financial management and accounting. \nOutline terms of reference of the consultants are in Appendix 3. The international consultant will \nbe recruited on an individual basis and the domestic consultants through a domestic firm using \nADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection procedures and according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants.  The  method  of  simplified  technical  proposal  will  be  used  for  the  domestic \nconsultants.  Equipment to be provided under the TA will be procured under supervision of the \nconsultant team leader in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \nIV.          THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n20.     The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Pakistan  for  Strengthening  Portfolio  Performance  and  Monitoring,  and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets    and Risks \n   \nGoal        \n     \nIncrease the  Quick and higher level of  Increase in contract  The Government is  \neffectiveness  disbursement of ADB  awards, and improved  committed to expeditious  \nof the development  loans and compliance with  disbursement level.  project implementation and \nassistance of the  loan covenants related to    undertake sector reforms.  \nAsian Development  development policy and     \nBank (ADB).   sector issues for overall  Satisfactory compliance  Changes in Government, \n  improvement in portfolio  with loan covenants and  unforeseen political \n  performance.     development goals.  problems, and lack of \n    commitment may delay \n    implementation of the \n  technical assistance (TA) \nrecommendations.  \nPurpose        \n     \nStrengthen portfolio  Portfolio performance  ADB\u2019s project performance   The Government will timely \nperformance and  indicators are developed  reports and the quarterly  implement the TA \nmonitoring of ADB  for ADB assisted projects.   reports of the Project Wing of  recommendations in all \nassisted projects.
