INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support selected developing \nmember countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2014Armenia, Indonesia, and \nMongolia\u2014to strengthen (i) country systems for climate risk-informed fiscal decision-making, and \n(ii) knowledge on climate risk-informed decision-making. \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the climate priorities of the DMCs, as reflected in their respective \nNationally Determined Contributions, and with ADB country partnership strategies.1 The TA will \nsupport the implementation of the operational plan for ADB Strategy 2030 operational priority 3 \non tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental \nsustainability.2 The TA will also contribute to operational priority 2 on accelerating progress in \ngender  equality,  and  operational  priority  6  on  strengthening  governance  and  institutional \ncapacity.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Developing countries in Asia and the Pacific are highly exposed to climate risk, and this \ncan have a significant effect on their development strategies and investments. It is estimated that \nwithout timely climate action, the gross domestic product of the Asia and the Pacific region could \ndecrease by as much as 3.3% by 2050 and 10.0% by 2100.4 \n \n4.  Increases in temperature and changes in rainfall patterns because of climate change can \nalter economic activities in the DMCs supported under this TA, especially in sectors that are highly \nsensitive to climatic conditions, with implications for revenue and wider inclusive economic \ngrowth. Additionally, increases in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events can \nburden governments\u2019 fiscal positions because of the cost of response and recovery. With rapid \nincreases in climate risk, it is expected that the costs of dealing with these impacts will increase \nin the future and severely strain the fiscal position of the DMCs. The key factors that determine \nan economy\u2019s fiscal vulnerability to the potential impact of climate change include the degree of \nexposure to hazards, the level of protection in place, and the state\u2019s liability for damages incurred; \nthese factors need to be addressed in the context of changing climate risk.5 \n \n5.  Further, recognizing that the economies of the DMCs supported under this TA are largely \ndependent on the climate-sensitive sectors of agriculture, tourism, and fisheries, it is critical to \nunderstand the long-term climate-related risks and opportunities in these sectors, informed by \ngender analysis, and to develop climate-resilient pathways. These pathways can help articulate \nthe  sector\u2019s  long-term  vision  and  guide  the  identification  and  prioritization  of  policies  and \n \n1  ADB. 2017.

Such an approach would ensure that investments do not \nlock  in  economies  to  maladaptive  pathways.  Climate-resilient  pathways  can  also  help \ndevelopment partners, such as ADB, to prioritize their support in specific sectors through policy, \ninvestments, and knowledge. \n \n6.  To address the impacts of climate risk on fiscal sustainability, DMCs supported under this \nTA  need  to  urgently  integrate  climate  resilience  considerations  in  fiscal  decision-making \nprocesses to (i) inform the appropriate level of spending on climate adaptation actions and (ii) \ndetermine potential sources of revenue (such as through environmental taxes) to finance climate \nadaptation measures. Such integration will allow DMCs to (i) identify, prioritize, and implement \nclimate  adaptation  strategies,  including  public  investments  in  resilient  infrastructure  and \nlivelihoods that promote inclusive economic development; (ii) adopt regulations that steer public \nand private development in a resilient direction; (iii) introduce fees and taxes on the use of natural \nresources that will be affected by changes in climate variables; and (iv) formulate incentives to \nencourage households and the private sector to invest in resilience building. The urgency in \nundertaking such integration is critical because the effects of climate change are not increasing \nat a linear rate, and beyond a certain threshold the correlation between changes in each climate \nvariable (such as temperature increase) and its impact on the economy (such as agricultural \nproductivity) becomes intensely negative and thereby reduces opportunities for adaptation. \n \n7.  The need to integrate climate resilience considerations into fiscal decision-making is more \napparent in the current context of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) recovery, as the pandemic \nhas highlighted the underlying drivers of vulnerability and emphasized the importance of building \nresilience to shocks.6 As countries design their recovery packages, potentially including reforms, \ntax cuts, subsidies, and incentives, it will be important to understand the implication of potential \nrecovery measures on climate-resilient development, identify trade-offs (especially in the context \nof addressing multi-hazard considerations), and promote green and resilient recovery measures. \n \n8.  Globally,  the  importance  of  climate  risk-informed  fiscal  decision-making  is  gaining \nmomentum. The Global Commission on Adaptation (GCA) has highlighted the importance of \nintegrating climate risk into all aspects of planning and decision-making.7 The Coalition of Finance \nMinisters for Climate Action, which brings together fiscal and economic policy makers from more \nthan 50 countries (including Indonesia) in leading the global climate response, has adopted the \nHelsinki Principles, which promote integration of climate considerations in macroeconomic policy, \nfiscal planning, budgeting, public investment management, and procurement practices.8 The \nGroup of 20 \u201cPrinciples of Quality Infrastructure Investment\u201d include a principle on building \nresilience to disasters and other risks. \n \n9.  Despite increasing awareness of climate risk and its potential adverse impact on long-\nterm development, the DMCs supported under this TA are at an early stage of integrating climate \nresilience considerations into fiscal decision-making, and they require support in overcoming \nchallenges related to (i) limited availability of information and tools that can inform country \nsystems, and (ii) limited access to knowledge and global good practices. This was confirmed by \n \n6  ADB. 2020. COVID-19 Recovery: A Pathway to a Low-Carbon and Resilient Future. Manila.  \n7  GCA. 2019. Adapt Now: A Global Call for Leadership on Climate Resilience. Rotterdam. \n8  Key actions identified include (i) developing tools to address knowledge and expertise gaps in macroeconomic \nforecasting and fiscal planning for climate change impacts; (ii) preparing toolkits and guides on whole-of-government \napproaches that integrate climate in the policy and budget process; and (iii) supporting macroeconomic and fiscal \nassessment of adaptation, resilience and mitigation policies, including Nationally Determined Contributions. \n ", "  3 \neach ministry of finance of the TA DMCs during initial discussions held at the TA concept paper \nstage. \n \n10.  Challenges related to information and tools include (i) limited availability of climate risk \ninformation that can be used for fiscal decision-making purposes; (ii) limited awareness on how \nto integrate climate resilience considerations into macroeconomic forecasting and public financial \nmanagement tools; (iii) limited capacity to incorporate uncertainty in decision-making; (iv) limited \nmechanisms for interministerial and interagency cooperation to discuss risks and opportunities \nfaced by key economic sectors and how such understanding can guide the development of \nclimate-resilient pathways; and (iv) limited opportunities for stakeholder coordination among \ngovernment,  the  private  sector  and  civil  society  organizations  to  prioritize  and  mobilize \ninvestments for climate adaptation. In regard to limited knowledge, recognizing that the integration \nof climate resilience considerations in fiscal decision-making is a relatively new topic for the DMCs \nsupported through this TA, it is important to facilitate access to lessons emerging from similar \nglobal and regional initiatives, and to ensure there are opportunities for the DMCs to learn from \ntheir peers in other countries. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: climate risk considerations integrated into \nmacro-fiscal and public financial management processes. The TA will have the following outcome: \ndecision-making for climate-resilient development in selected  DMCs  improved.9 The  outcome \nindicator will be as follows: three DMCs have integrated climate resilience considerations in \nselected fiscal policy and management processes. This will be measured by the tools developed \nthrough the TA used (i) in implementing national climate adaptation plans in the three DMCs, and \n(ii) in informing at least three policies. Recognizing the differences in the nature of climate risks \nand in the fiscal policy and management processes in each of the three DMCs, the proposed \noutcome indicator will allow achieving the outcome within the context of respective national \npriorities. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output  1:  Country  systems  for  climate  risk-informed  fiscal  decision-making \nstrengthened. Under this output, the TA will support the following:  \n(i)  Diagnostic  work  to  provide  recommendations  for  mainstreaming  climate \nresilience  considerations  into  macroeconomic  policy,  medium-term  fiscal \nstrategies, annual budget strategy papers, public investment management, \nand public procurement processes. The recommendations will focus on tools \nfor  considering  climate  impact  in  macroeconomic  forecasting  and  fiscal \nplanning,  to  inform  (a)  expenditure  and  revenue  (such  as  through \nenvironmental  taxes)  for  climate  adaptation,  (b)  guidance  on  integrating \nclimate risk considerations into budgeting and procurement processes, and (c) \nmacroeconomic and fiscal assessments, based on country priorities.10 \n \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n10 The exact nature of these activities will differ in each DMC and will be decided during the inception phase. This will \nbuild on the work carried out by the United Nations Development Programme to support countries in undertaking \ntheir climate public expenditure and institutional reviews to inform budget for climate actions. \n ", "4   \n \n(ii)  Development of a climate-resilient pathway for a selected sector in each of \nthree DMCs supported under the TA, which will help articulate a long-term \nvision and guide the identification and prioritization of strategies, policies, and \ninvestments to achieve such a vision. Identification of such investments would \nalso provide guidance to ADB in developing a pipeline of projects in the \nselected sector. This sector will be selected in consultation with the DMCs \nconsidering national priorities, including sectors identified in their Nationally \nDetermined Contributions, national adaptation plans, and COVID-19 recovery \nplans.11 The climate-resilient pathways will be informed by gender analysis.12 \n(iii)  Capacity building of staff from relevant DMC ministries, including staff from \nministries of finance, ministries of planning, and selected sector ministries, on \nthe use of (a) climate risk information and other hazard information (along with \nuncertainties in fiscal decision-making) and (b) risk-informed planning tools \nand guidelines. The capacity building will be carried out in person. Possible \npartnerships with national training institutions and/or academic institutions will \nbe explored to build a cohort of trainers. \n(iv)  Strengthening  national  interagency  coordination  mechanisms  on  climate \nadaptation through regular meetings and dialogue to facilitate climate risk-\ninformed fiscal decision-making.13 \n \n13.  Support provided through proposed diagnostic work, improved understanding of long-term \nclimate risk and opportunities in specific sectors, capacity building on use of climate risk-informed \nfiscal planning tools and guidelines, and strengthened coordination between ministries and with \nstakeholders,  will  lead  to  improved  decision-making  for  climate-resilient  development  and \ndevelopment and strengthening of fiscal policy and management processes to support such \ndecision-making. The proposed scope of the output is in line with the findings from global \nresearch, as documented in the GCA\u2019s flagship report calling for leadership on climate resilience \n(footnote 7). The GCA report calls for a revolution in the understanding of climate risk and \nreflection on such understanding in planning and finance-related decision-making.14 In particular, \nthe GCA report highlights the need for upstream macroeconomic analysis of climate risk, taking \na longer-term perspective in sector planning that factors in uncertainty, and integrating resilience \nconsiderations into investment and financing decisions from the beginning. Operationalizing such \ndirections requires improved in-country systems for climate risk-informed fiscal decision-making. \n \n14.  Output 2: Knowledge on climate risk-informed decision-making enhanced. Under \nthis output, the TA will support the following: \n(i)  Facilitating roundtable dialogue between national and local governments, civil \nsociety organizations, and the private sector on the importance of investing in \nclimate resilience. Such dialogue will help raise ambitions for investing in \nclimate  adaptation,  identify  challenges  faced  by  different  stakeholders \n(including the private sector), and discuss opportunities for investing in climate \n \n11 The Government of Indonesia has prioritized the agriculture and fisheries sectors for this activity. \n12 This will build on work being undertaken by the regional TA project on Strengthening Women\u2019s Resilience to Climate \nChange and Disaster Risk in Asia and the Pacific being implemented in selected DMCs, including Mongolia. ADB. \n2017. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Women\u2019s Resilience to Climate Change and Disaster Risk in Asia and \nthe Pacific. Manila. \n13 Examples include the Inter-Agency Coordinating Council on Climate Change in Armenia and the National Climate \nChange Committee in Mongolia. \n14 The GCA report highlights the need for accelerating adaptation in key systems (i) food security and livelihoods of \nsmall-scale producers, (ii) natural environment, (iii) water, (iv) cities and urban areas, (v) infrastructure, (vi) disaster \nrisk management, and (vii) financing adaptation. \n \n ", "  5 \nadaptation by adopting a whole-of-society approach toward building climate \nresilience. \n(ii)  Conducting regional learning workshops with TA DMCs and other selected \nDMCs  to  share  experiences  on  climate  risk-informed  fiscal  management \nprocesses. \n(iii)  Organizing online and/or in-person peer-to-peer sharing of experiences of TA \nDMCs  with  other  DMCs,  especially  with  DMCs  that  implemented  similar \ninitiatives under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) under the \nClimate Investment Funds, which ADB and other multilateral development \nbanks are implementing entities.15 \n(iv)  Sharing experiences by TA DMCs globally through the GCA\u2019s capacity building \nprogram for central ministries of finance and planning to support their efforts to \nintegrate climate risks into decision-making processes.16 \n \n15.  The GCA calls for collaboration from various segments of society\u2014government, the \nprivate sector, and civil society organizations\u2014to collectively take forward the agenda on climate \nresilience. The multi-stakeholder roundtable dialogues proposed by the GCA aim to promote a \nwhole-of-society  approach  in  understanding  risk,  identifying  opportunities,  and  prioritizing \ninvestments,  thereby  improving  climate  resilience  decision-making.  Further,  the  proposed \napproach for sharing experiences within each country, with other countries in the same region, \nand globally is line with the priorities of the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action, which \nhas recognized sharing experiences as one of the six principles of the Helsinki Principles, as this \nsharing provides mutual encouragement and promotes collective understanding of policies and \npractices  for  climate  action.  A  peer-to-peer  learning  format\u2014online  and  in-person\u2014will  be \nadopted to facilitate sharing of experiences. \n \n16.  The TA is innovative, as it attempts to shift the entry point for climate adaptation from a \nproject  level  to  upstream  fiscal  and  sector  planning.  Such  an  approach  will  allow  for  the \nidentification of wider processes that can help influence the future pipeline of investments in \nclimate adaptation, including investments that could be potentially be financed by ADB. Further, \nby promoting a whole-of-society approach toward resilience, the TA aims to systematically \nengage  the  private  sector  in  climate  adaptation-related  investments,  which  is  critical  in \nrecognizing the scale of finance needed for climate adaptation.17 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,150,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nStrategic Climate Fund18 and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. \n \n \n15 ADB DMCs covered by the Climate Investment Funds include Armenia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, India, \nIndonesia, Kiribati, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Papua New \nGuinea, Philippines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tajikistan, Thailand, Tonga, Vanuatu and Viet Nam. \n16 The initiative will be implemented by the World Resources Institute in partnership with the Global Resilience \nPartnership. Apart from capacity building, the initiative also aims to strengthen the network of ministries of finance \ninvolved in climate adaptation, including the Coalition of Finance Ministers for Climate Action. \n17 Estimates show that the global annual cost of adaptation will range from $140 billion to $300 billion by 2030 and from \n$280 billion to $500 billion by 2050.
