I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed\nsovereign loan of $100 million to India, and (ii) a proposed loan of $90 million in Indian rupee\nequivalent, without a sovereign guarantee, to Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited\n(BESCOM) for the Bengaluru Smart Energy Efficient Power Distribution Project.\n2. The project will (i) convert overhead distribution lines to underground cables, with parallel\ninstallation of optical fiber cables; and (ii) install automated ring main units adapted with a\ndistribution  automation  system  (DAS)  in  six  divisions,  spanning  52  subdivisions,  in  urban\nBengaluru city in the state of Karnataka. The Asian Development Bank (ADB)-funded component\nof the project will cover 17 out of these 52 subdivisions. As a result of this project, the efficiency,\nreliability, and safety of the power distribution system in urban areas of Bengaluru will be\nenhanced. The project has received in-principle approval from Karnataka Electricity Regulatory\nCommission (KERC), which determines the end consumer electricity tariff. This will ensure that\nthe project costs and benefits are reflected in the consumer tariff. The project will also strengthen\nthe institutional capacity of BESCOM in operation and maintenance (O&M), environment and\nsocial safeguards, financial management, and corporate gender equality and social inclusion.\n3. The project demonstrates an innovative project financing structure. The combination of\nsovereign and nonsovereign loans from ADB will significantly reduce the sovereign exposure and\nhelp BESCOM move towards a market-based approach for raising financial resources for capital\nexpenditure. The project will introduce BESCOM to practices and procedures for accessing\ncommercial financing from an international lender and instill financial management discipline\nduring monitoring. This financing arrangement is the first case of its kind for ADB - in which ADB\nis pilot testing a provision of a combined support to a state government-owned (sub-sovereign)\nenterprise.\nII. THE PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n4. State economy. Karnataka is India\u2019s information technology hub. Bengaluru, the state\ncapital, is the fourth largest technological cluster in the world, after Silicon Valley, San Francisco,\nand London. In 2019, exports of electronics and computer software from the state  totaled\n$77 billion, or about 39% of India\u2019s electronics and computer software exports, and 76% of\nKarnataka\u2019s overall exports.1 Along with rapid economic growth (about 6.8% per annum), the\nurban population grew from about 7 million in 2008 to more than 10 million in 2019, with a\npopulation density of 4,400 persons per square kilometer, making Bengaluru the fourth most\npopulous city in India after Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata. Based on this rapid economic growth,\nelectricity demand has also increased by an average of 10% per year since 2015.\n5. Sector overview. Power distribution is the most crucial yet the weakest link in India\u2019s\nelectricity supply chain. It has a direct impact on the energy sector\u2019s commercial viability, and\nultimately consumers, through intermittent supply and high tariffs. The distribution sector has\ntraditionally had high distribution losses caused by old and dilapidated equipment, electricity theft,\nlow metering levels, and poor financial health of utilities, with low cost recovery. Because of this,\nmany distribution companies (DISCOMs) have not been able to invest sufficiently in infrastructure\naugmentation.\n1  Indian Brand Equity Foundation. 2018. Karnataka: The Silicon Valley of India. New Delhi. ", "2 \n6.  India has about 73 distribution utilities\u201413 electricity departments, 17 private DISCOMs, \n41 corporatized DISCOMs, and 2 state electricity boards. In the state of Karnataka, Karnataka \nElectricity  Board  was  unbundled  along  functional  lines  into  a  transmission  and  distribution \ncompany called Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL) and a generating \ncompany called Visvesvaraya Vidyuth Nigam Limited in April 2000. KPTCL was subsequently \nunbundled into six independent companies in 2002, with one transmission company (KPTCL) and \nfive DISCOMs (including BESCOM).2  \n \n7.  KERC  is  an  independent  authority  responsible  for  regulating  electricity  supply  and \ndistribution in Karnataka state, including determining user tariffs for generation, transmission, and \ndistribution. Karnataka has a well-established multiyear tariff regime under which KERC provides \ntariff sustainability and visibility for a 3-year period. Tariff determination works on the principle of \nan approved regulated asset base, operating expenses, debt service, and the provision of a fixed \nreturn on equity. DISCOMs in the state file tariff petitions each year for KERC to review and revise \nits tariff structure to align it with actual expenses.  \n \n8.  Client overview. BESCOM, incorporated in 2002, is one of five state-owned distribution \nutilities in Karnataka licensed to supply electricity in the state. It is the largest distribution utility in \nKarnataka and is responsible for power distribution in eight divisions, covering 41,092 square \nkilometers and more than 11.8 million consumers in 2019. The company has four operating zones \nin Bengaluru,3 covering, in aggregate, about 100,000 kilometers (km) of 11 kilovolt medium \nvoltage lines and 170,000 km of 1.1 kilovolt and 230-volt low voltage lines. \n \n9.  Financial performance. BESCOM has been one of the better performing distribution \nentities in India in terms of operational and financial parameters, ranking fourth among India\u2019s 41 \nstate power distribution utilities in 2019.4 BESCOM has maintained an ideal mix of consumer \nprofile, with a good balance of commercial and domestic consumers.5 However, its financial \nmanagement practices could be improved. BESCOM\u2019s borrowings are all from public financial \ninstitutions (e.g., Power Finance Corporation, and Rural Electrification Corporation Limited) and \npublic  sector  banks.  These  loans  are  typically  made  based  on  BESCOM\u2019s  position  as  a \nGovernment of Karnataka (GOK)-owned entity, rather than its standalone credit profile. Improved \nfinancial management capability will allow BESCOM to improve its credit profile and tap the \ndomestic  and  international  commercial  financing  market\u2014a  more  sustainable  source  of \nfinancing\u2014for critical infrastructure development\u2014rather than relying from sovereign borrowings.  \n \n10.  Leveraging nonsovereign financing. The GOK sets guidelines for access to sovereign \nborrowing from international financial institutions for revenue-generating sectors such as the \nenergy  sector.  The  aim  is  to  maximize  the  allocation  of  sovereign  borrowing  space  for \nnonrevenue-generating, poverty reduction-focused projects, and/or emergency responses to \nnational crises caused by events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). BESCOM \nfalls in between revenue-generating and nonrevenue-generating segments, as a large part of the \npower sold by BESCOM is priced commercially  while a portion is sold to the low-income \n \n2  The five companies are (i) Mangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited, (ii) Hubli Electricity Supply Company \nLimited, (iii) Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company Limited, (iv) Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation \nLimited, and (v) Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited. \n3  Bengaluru Metropolitan Area Zone (North), Bengaluru Metropolitan Area Zone (South), Bengaluru Rural Area Zone, \nand Chitradurga Zone. \n4  Government of India, Ministry of Power. 2019. State Distribution Utilities Seventh Annual Integrated Rating. \nNew Delhi. \n5  The total number of consumers served by BESCOM was about 11.8 million in 2019, of which about 67% were \nhouseholds, 25.2% were commercial and industrial consumers, and 7.8% were for irrigation pumps. \n ", "3 \nhouseholds and the agriculture sector, priced below cost and requiring a GOK subsidy. For such \nentities falling between revenue-generating and nonrevenue-generating segments, the objective \nof  using  sovereign  loans  is  to  leverage\u2014to  the  maximum  extent  possible\u2014commercial \nnonsovereign borrowing. Consistent with this objective, the Government of India and the GOK \nseek ADB assistance to pilot test a combination of sovereign and nonsovereign financing for \ninvestment in Karnataka\u2019s power distribution segment. The provision of a nonsovereign loan by \nADB without a sovereign guarantee from India, in combination with a sovereign loan, will act as \na transition measure towards moving BESCOM towards full market-based financing - by (i) \nenhancing  financial  discipline;  (ii)  strengthening  its  financial  performance  through  regular \nmonitoring; and (iii) eventually enabling BESCOM to access borrowing from commercial banks \nboth locally and internationally, without seeking credit enhancement from the GOK and/or the \ncentral government, thereby freeing up fiscal space. This pilot collaboration will provide lessons \nto structure similar initiatives in the future and open opportunities for large-scale lending on a \ncombined basis to sub-sovereign entities, particularly in power distribution.  \n \n11.  Technical performance. The capacity of the power distribution system in the Bengaluru \nurban area is inadequate and unreliable. Technical and commercial losses are about 13%, \nsignificantly higher than the international average of 5%, because of the high level of unauthorized \nconnections and overloading of conductors. The quality and reliability of electricity supply in the \nBengaluru urban area remain low by international standards. The average annual outage duration \nin  2019  was  112.0  hours  per  customer,  compared  with  a  median  value  of  1.5  hours  for \nNorth American utilities. Further, the Bengaluru urban area had 15.3 times of power interruptions \nper customer in 2019, compared with a median value of 1.1 times for North American utilities. \nThese performance indicators are unacceptably high for Bengaluru, which is expected to have a \nmodern electrical distribution network as India\u2019s leading technology hub. \n \n12.  Bengaluru experiences frequent thunderstorms, which occasionally cause power outages \nand local flooding. The overhead distribution system is unsafe, particularly in urban areas. The \ndistribution lines are prone to coming into contact with trees, animals, and human beings; and can \ncause power failures and fires as well as serious and fatal accidents. Utility poles on sidewalks \ncreate obstacles for pedestrians. During disasters caused by natural hazards, snapped lines and \nbroken poles cause accidents, destabilize electricity supply and information network systems, and \nblock  emergency  transportation  roads  and  evacuation routes.6 To  cope  with these  issues, \nBESCOM has developed an $845 million plan to convert existing overhead distribution lines to \nunderground cables, and install automated ring main units adapted with a DAS covering the \n52 subdivisions in four phases.  \n \n13.  Government  power  distribution  program.  Building  an  energy-efficient  distribution \nnetwork is one of the climate mitigation strategies identified under India\u2019s Nationally Determined \nContributions.7 The Ministry of Power promotes the conversion of overhead distribution lines to \nunderground lines, and the integration of information technology in the power distribution system \nof urban areas to reduce system losses under the Integrated Power Development Scheme.8 In \naddition, under the proposed DISCOM sector reform, it targets reducing the aggregate technical \nand commercial loss to 12%\u201315% by 2025. Building efficient urban infrastructure is a key \nprovision, including the development of underground distribution networks in the Bengaluru urban \narea, under the Revised Master Plan 2031 for Bengaluru,9 aimed at developing a livable city. \n \n6  V.

Reliable electricity supply is a lifeline \ninfrastructure in urban areas, and essential to sustain the operation of high-technology industries \nunder  normal  situations\u2014and  particularly  during  and  after  COVID-19.  Under  the  lockdown \nsituation with COVID-19, electricity supply has been a critical input to support essential services \nsuch as health care, food production and supply, and online businesses for basic social needs. \nReliable electricity is also important to support essential household activities such as (i) working \nfrom  home,  (ii) online  schooling  in  a  comfortable  indoor  environment (air-conditioning),  and \n(iii) making online services available for essential activities such as bill payments and shopping.  \n \n15.  In more general terms, modernizing power distribution networks in the Bengaluru urban \narea will (i) reduce distribution losses, thereby reducing the additional consumption of fossil fuels \nand associated greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants; (ii) improve the reliability and quality \nof the electricity service for more than 10 million people and high-technology industries; and \n(iii) contribute to developing a livable and disaster-resilient city. \n \n16.  ADB experience and lessons learned. ADB has implemented several power distribution \nprojects in India since 2010.10 Proper O&M of invested assets was a key to success learned from \nprevious ADB projects.  \n \n17.  Strategic context. The proposed project will contribute to achieving the operational \npriorities (OP) of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 for (i) making cities more livable (OP 4), and tackling \nclimate change and building disaster resilience (OP 3) by converting existing power distribution \ninfrastructure  to  smart,  safe,  energy-efficient,  and  climate-resilient  infrastructure;  and \n(ii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity (OP 6), and accelerating progress in \ngender  equality  (OP  2)  by  strengthening  the  institutional  capacity  of  BESCOM  in  O&M, \nenvironment and social safeguards, financial management, and corporate gender and social \ninclusion. 11 It  supports  the  following  priorities  under  the  country  partnership  strategy  for \nIndia, 2018\u20132022:12 (i) pillar 1: boosting economic competitiveness to create more and better jobs, \nand (ii) pillar 3: addressing climate change and increasing climate resilience. It is aligned with \npromoting  energy  efficiency  under  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy  2009.13 It  is  consistent  with  the \nrecommendation of the recent ADB\u2019s sector-wide evaluation of ADB Energy Policy and Program, \nin terms of enhancing our assistance to distribution sector with policy reforms and innovations.14 \nThe proposed project is included in the country operations business plan for India (2021\u20132023).15 \nIt also supports the sustainable development goals (SDGs) to (i) ensure universal access to \naffordable, reliable and modern energy services (SDG 7.1); (ii) provide universal access to \nsafe, inclusive, and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, \nolder persons and persons with disabilities (SDG 11.7); and (iii) strengthen resilience and \nadaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and disasters in all countries (13.a).16  \n \n10 ADB.

The project will have the following outcome: energy efficiency, reliability, and safety \nof power supply system in Bengaluru urban areas improved.17 \n \n19.  Output 1: Smart, and climate- and disaster-resilient power distribution system \nestablished in six divisions in urban areas of Bengaluru. The project will (i) convert 7,200 km \nof overhead distribution lines to underground cables, with 2,800 km of optical fiber cables, and \n(ii) install 1,700 automated ring main units adapted with a DAS. The sovereign and non-sovereign \nloans will finance separate contracts in different divisions in the project area.18  \n \n20.  The conversion to underground distribution lines allows appropriate sizing of conductors \nand prevents electricity theft from overhead lines, which will contribute to reducing technical and \ncommercial losses by about 30%. The proposed solution will minimize electricity outages resulting \nfrom natural hazards (e.g., cyclones) and interference with overhead distribution lines by foreign \nobjects. The project will support efforts toward building green and climate-resilient cities, as the \nunderground distribution lines will facilitate the construction of pedestrian-friendly sidewalks and \neliminate the need to prune or remove trees to keep the minimum distance from live wires.  \n \n21.  The  DAS  will  allow  the  power  system  to  monitor  and  control  the  distribution  line \nswitchgears from the control center, contributing to shorter power interruptions. It will enable \nautomatic continuity of the power flow to healthy sections of the distribution system, efficiently \nisolating the failed sections until further repair work\u2014without having to dispatch staff to the field \nwhen a high voltage distribution line experiences a failure.19 In addition, the DAS contributes to \noptimization of the distribution system itself through monitoring of load current, minimizing losses \nand overloading.  \n \n22.  The proposed project will install optical fiber communication cables in parallel with the \nconversion of overhead distribution lines to underground lines.20 Optical fiber communication \ncables can be utilized for a smart metering system, DAS, and any other devices that contribute to \nmaking the distribution grid more reliable, flexible, responsive, and smart. Surplus capacity of the \noptical fiber network will be leased to private telecommunications companies. This will help create \nbetter and faster internet communications, which will help support work from home and online \nschooling arrangements during and after COVID-19. The project will apply international best \npractices to Bengaluru, as a megacity and India\u2019s Silicon Valley, to improve the safety of its \ncitizens and minimize adverse impacts on economic activities from power failures.  \n \n23.   Output 2: Institutional capacity of implementing agency improved. The proposed \nproject will strengthen the capacity of BESCOM in (i) O&M of smart power distribution systems, \n(ii) environment and social safeguards, (iii) financial management, and (iv) corporate gender and \n \n17 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n18 The sovereign loan will finance three divisions (Kora Mangala, HSR Division, and White Field), the nonsovereign \nloan will finance two divisions (Shivaji Nagar and Indira Nagar), and the implementing agency will finance one division \n(Jaya Nagara).  \n19 Without a DAS, if a power interruption arises from a failure in the high voltage distribution line, DISCOM staff are \ndispatched to the field to detect the failure point and operate switchgears in the distribution line in order to isolate \nsuch faults and continue power transmission to the unaffected sections. \n20 An example is in Japan under the service area of Kansai Electric Power (around the Osaka region). \n ", "6 \nsocial  inclusion,  under  the  approved  transaction  technical  assistance  and  ADB\u2019s  in-house \nexpertise.21   \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB  \n \n24.  The proposed project represents the first instance where ADB will use a combination of \nsovereign and nonsovereign lending to support a fully state government-owned (sub-sovereign) \nenterprise.  By employing this modality, the ADB assistance will represent an innovative project \nfinancing arrangement for supporting such borrowers. This financing will add significant value to \nGOK by reducing its need for\u2014and instead leveraging on\u2014a sovereign assistance, thus releasing \nscarce sovereign borrowing capacity that can now be deployed for meeting more pressing social \nneeds such as for COVID-19 response and provision of health care. The nonsovereign loan will \nalso add value to BESCOM by providing much needed long-term local currency financing which \nis not readily available in the domestic commercial market. ADB\u2019s involvement will also add value \nby  improving  BESCOM\u2019s  institutional  capacity  to  raise  commercial  financing\u2014through  its \ninvolvement  in  the  processing,  due  diligence,  and  commercial  negotiations  of  the  ADB \nnonsovereign loan. In addition, through regular monitoring (including compliance with financial \ncovenants), the ADB loans will add value by enhancing financial discipline and strengthening the \nfinancial performance of BESCOM, helping it transition toward a sustainable, market-based \napproach for financing future capital expenditure. Once established, this model can be replicated \nin other states and across the region.  \n \n25.  As BESCOM will be adopting new technology under the proposed project, ADB organized \na training for BESCOM engineers to strengthen their knowledge and resources for O&M of the \nunderground power cable and optical fiber network, in partnership with a leading power DISCOM \nin Japan. Similar training will be provided during the project implementation. Since BESCOM does \nnot have previous project implementation experience with ADB and/or other multilateral financial \ninstitutions, ADB will also add significant value by (i) supporting it in developing an environmental \nand social management system applicable to all BESCOM operations as well as providing training \nin environment safeguards at the project level to strengthen its implementation, supervision, and \nmonitoring capacity; (ii) supporting the implementation of a financial management action plan to \nenhance the financial control and computerization of the financial and accounting processes; and \n(iii) conducting a gender analysis of BESCOM\u2019s corporate structure and developing a corporate \ngender and social inclusion strategy for BESCOM that will establish gender targets for education, \ntraining, and awareness-raising initiatives during the project.  \n \nD.

Since the project has a 5-year implementation \nperiod, which incorporates sufficient buffer to account for project planning related contingencies, \nany short-term disruption caused by COVID-19 is not expected to cause significant delays or cost \nincreases. BESCOM continues to work effectively and efficiently within the constraints imposed \nby the government\u2019s response to the pandemic. However, given the evolving situation of COVID-\n19, BESCOM and ADB will monitor its impact regularly.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n37.  Power distribution networks are the most vulnerable to storms and extreme weather \nevents. Improvements in the  overall condition and efficiency of the power delivery system \nstrengthen the resilience of the system and support rapid recovery from weather-related outages. \nThe project has been designed to adopt underground cabling to mitigate climate and disaster \nrisks by minimizing power outages from natural hazards and extreme weather events. Cross-\nlinked polyethylene-insulated aluminum conductor armored cable, which is waterproof and will \nnot be affected by increased rainfall or increased soil moisture, will be used under the project for \nunderground distribution cable. The technical viability of underground cabling is well established, \nas it has been used widely in large cities all over the world. BESCOM has experience in installing \nunderground cabling on a pilot basis and has received training on the O&M of underground \ncabling from a leading power DISCOM in Japan during the project preparation.   \n \nB.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government of India, the GOK, and BESCOM. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM.23 \n \nE.  Investment Limitations  \n \n45.  The proposed nonsovereign loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and \nsingle exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nF.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n46.  Social benefits. The project will directly benefit about 5.2 million people in the project \narea, of whom about half are female. Direct benefits will go to students and staff in about \n986 schools, and patients and medical staff in about 562 hospitals. The project will provide reliable \nelectricity services to households, including low-income households, in the project areas. The \nproject will (i) improve living conditions through adequate and reliable electricity supply services, \n(ii) improve the resilience of the urban power distribution system to natural hazards, (iii) remove \nhazards associated with overhead power lines, (iv) help make sidewalks more pedestrian-friendly \nby  removing  power  distribution  line  poles,  (v)  improve  education  and  medical  services  by \nproviding reliable electricity supply services, and (vi) potentially increase incomes through 290 job \nopportunities created during construction and 50 positions created during operations. \n \n47.  Gender equality. The project is classified some gender elements. It can help promote \ngender equality and social inclusion in the following areas: (i) access to affordable electricity for \nfemale-headed poor households; (ii) gender-inclusive energy conservation, safety awareness, \nand customer satisfaction; and (iii) gender mainstreaming assessment of policies and operations \nat BESCOM\u2019s corporate level. BESCOM commits to implement measures to promote gender \nequality or women\u2019s empowerment in its business activities following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender \nand Development.24 Key gender actions relate to (i) ensuring the granting of a lifeline tariff to poor \nhouseholds  headed  by  women  through  a  100%  subsidy  of  the  electricity  bill  by  the  local \ngovernment and waiving connection fees by BESCOM; (ii) supporting a gender-inclusive energy \nconservation  campaign;  (iii)  supporting  a  gender-inclusive  safety  awareness  campaign; \n(iv) conducting customer satisfaction surveys in a gender-responsive manner to improve service \ndelivery; and (v) conducting a gender analysis of BESCOM\u2019s corporate structure and preparing a \n \n22 Pilot project was implemented in four subdivisions in two divisions (Vidhana Soudha and Shivajinagar) in 2018. \n23 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n ", "9 \ncorporate gender and social inclusion strategy for BESCOM that establishes gender targets for \neducation, training, and awareness-raising initiatives for the duration of the project. BESCOM will \nsubmit periodic reports on the implementation of its gender measures to ADB. \n \nG.  Safeguards \n \n48.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories  are  as  follows. 25  A  corporate  audit  of  BESCOM\u2019s  environmental  and  social \nmanagement  system  and  performance  was  undertaken  by  an  external  consultant,  and  a \ncorrective action plan for completion before the first disbursement was agreed with BESCOM to \naddress the identified gaps.  \n \n49.  Environment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  involving \nmeaningful consultations with affected communities was prepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement.26 Works will take place in the Bengaluru urban area along existing rights-of-\nway (ROWs), so potential impacts\u2014including pollution, health, and safety risks\u2014are generally \nminor, site-specific, and limited to construction. Construction will disrupt traffic.  During operation \nsulfur hexafluoride (a potent greenhouse gas) may leak from the ring main units. However, moving \ncables underground will reduce health and safety risks in the long term. Potential impacts will be \nmitigated  following  national  requirements  and  international  good  practice  through  the \nenvironmental management plan included in the IEE, for which a budget of $0.7 million has been \nset  aside.  A  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  be  established.  Monitoring  reports  will  be \nsubmitted semiannually until the project completion report is issued (or a later date agreed \ntherein)  for  the  sovereign  component,  and  then  annually  until  final  maturity  date  of  the \nnonsovereign  loan.  BESCOM  will  (i)  appoint  a  safeguard  team  to  supervise  and  monitor \nimplementation, (ii) provide training to its staff and contractors, and (iii) recruit an independent \nenvironment consultant to help ensure safeguards compliance. The safeguard documents were \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 9 October 2020. BESCOM will disclose the IEE locally through \ntheir website with printed copies available via their division offices. Sovereign contract packages \nhave not yet been awarded, but they will incorporate the environment management plan before \naward. Nonsovereign and BESCOM-financed contract packages were awarded in July 2019, and \nconstruction  has  commenced.  An  environmental  audit  of  these  ongoing  works  has  been \nundertaken by an external environmental consultant. BESCOM and its contractors will address \nthe gaps identified between their current performance and the requirements of the environmental \nmanagement plan as corrective actions. \n \n50.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project will follow the ROWs of the existing \nroads; and all feeders, transformers, and lines are located within the ROWs. Horizontal boring \nmethodology will be adopted, not open trench, to avoid informal ROWs users and secure \nadequate access. Due diligence confirmed that no households will need to relocate, so no \nphysical and/or economic displacement is envisaged in the project.   \n \n51.  BESCOM is required to inform ADB in advance about any change in scope that may result \nin temporary or permanent land acquisition, structure demolition, or involuntary resettlement, and \n \n25 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n26 The IEE is based on cable routings following existing overhead line corridors; the contractor will map and confirm \nactual alignments during project implementation. Once working drawings or maps have been completed, the IEE will \nbe reviewed\u2014before proceeding with works\u2014to confirm that no changes have been made to the alignments outside \nthe existing overhead line corridors and/or affecting environmentally sensitive areas; if any unanticipated impacts are \nidentified, the IEE will be updated accordingly. Some 718 households were surveyed from April to June 2019; and \nfocus group discussions were held with 103 persons (30% female) in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic. \n ", "10 \nmust prepare and submit a resettlement plan to ADB for review and approval prior to the \noccurrence of any displacement, following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.27 \n \n52.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The proposed project will be implemented in a large \nurban area where most people are Kannadigas, and the lifestyle and socioeconomic status of \nindividuals of the ethnic majority and minorities are similar. All physical activities of the proposed \nproject will be undertaken within the ROWs of the existing roads. Thus, it is not expected to have \nany impacts on ethnic minorities or their territories. Due diligence confirmed that no impacts are \nenvisaged on scheduled tribes or indigenous peoples. \n \nH.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n53.

The  government  and  the  GOK  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation of the project shall conform to all applicable ADB requirements, including those \nconcerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services, \nfinancial management, and disbursement, as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n61.  The government and the GOK have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the draft loan agreement and project agreement. \n \n62.  For  nonsovereign  loan.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (the  Charter),28 ADB  will  proceed  with  the  proposed  assistance  upon \nestablishing that the Government of India has no objection  to the proposed assistance to \nBESCOM. ADB will enter suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to \nADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \n \n27 People who are, or may in the future be, adversely affected by the project may submit complaints to ADB\u2019s \nAccountability Mechanism. The mechanism provides an independent forum and process whereby people adversely \naffected by ADB-assisted projects can voice, and seek a resolution to, their problems, as well as report alleged \nviolations of ADB\u2019s operational policies and procedures. Before submitting a complaint to the Accountability \nMechanism, affected people should make a good faith effort to solve their problems by working with the concerned \nADB operations department. Only after doing that, and if they are still dissatisfied, should they approach the \nAccountability Mechanism.  \n28 ADB. 1966. Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank.
