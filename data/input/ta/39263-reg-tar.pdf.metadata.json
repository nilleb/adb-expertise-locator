INTRODUCTION \n1.  In  its  commitment  to  give  relevant  information  and  analysis,  to  contribute  to  the \nintellectual environment in which policy formulation occurs, and to maintain and enhance its \nreputation as a credible and authoritative source of knowledge about the region, the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  regularly  monitors  and  provides  comprehensive  analysis  on  the \nevolving developments in its developing member countries (DMCs) through the publication of \nthe Asian Development Outlook (ADO).1 The ADO has been a flagship publication of ADB since \n1989. Its content informs Management opinion and guides institutional views about prospective \ndevelopments  and  other  important  issues.  The  production  of  the  ADO  has  been  regularly \nsupported by technical assistance (TA) funding. The objectives, scope, and activities to be \ncovered by the regional TA2 are in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The ADO will be releasing its 20th edition in 2008. Responding to clients\u2019 feedback and \nthe rapidly changing marketplace for economic information and analysis, efforts to improve the \nquality of the ADO have intensified in recent years. These efforts have focused on providing \nstronger analytical content and ensuring better cohesion and balance among its parts. If the \nADO is to remain competitive and relevant as an independent and credible source of knowledge \nand information about the region, continuous work must be done to further improve the quality \nof its analysis. Activities will include the commissioning of relevant applied and policy research \nat  a  country  and  regional  level,  the  development  of  new  sources  of  information,  and \nstrengthened peer review. High-quality editing services are crucial to ensure that the ADO\u2019s key \nmessages  are  communicated  clearly  and  effectively.  To  increase  the  ADO\u2019s  regional  and \ninternational reach, the Economics and Research Department (ERD) will continue to collaborate \nwith the Department of External Relations (DER). \n \n3.  As the ADO is one of the most frequently downloaded publications from ADB\u2019s website, \nit is directly or indirectly the source of much international and national news commentary that \nfeatures analysis, views, and opinions from ADB.  Thus, a concerted effort, not just to improve \nquality but also to differentiate and disseminate content, is needed to elevate the ADO\u2019s profile.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n4.  The TA will support activities that will contribute to high-quality and comprehensive \neconomic analysis of the region and help ensure the usefulness and relevance of ADO to policy \ndialogue and formulation in DMCs. The improved content and structure of ADO 2008 and its \nupdate  is  expected  to  provide  in-depth,  relevant  and  timely  assessment  of  the  region\u2019s \neconomy.  Appendix 2 contains the draft contents pages of ADO 2008 and ADO 2008 Update. \nFor its 20th edition, the ADO will feature essays discussing life-cycle issues for workers.  It will \ninclude  topics  on  the  youth  labor  market,  migration  and  remittances,  workers\u2019  skills  and \npensions.  \n \n                                                 \n \n1 The Asian Development Outlook (ADO) is sold externally, and is extensively reviewed and commented on in the \nmedia. It is the most popular document on the ADB website. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 18 July 2007. \n ", "2   \n5.  The TA will further develop and refine analytical methods to support ADB\u2019s short- and \nmedium-term country economic monitoring and reporting. The methods will also strengthen the \neconomic underpinnings of country programs and strategies for the DMCs covered. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The main outputs from the TA will be ADO 2008 and ADO 2008 Update. The TA will \nsupport  the  following  key  activities:  preparation  of  background  analytical  papers;  further \ndevelopment and refinement of analytical methods; drafting of ADO content; economic and copy \nediting; and preparation and layout of materials for publication. The objective of the papers will \nbe to provide a solid empirical and analytical foundation for ADO content. The papers will \nsupplement the research work of the ADB Macroeconomics and Finance Research Division \n(ERMF) on the selected topics and will contain analysis of issues and policy implications for the \nDMCs covered using a review of existing literature, analyses of survey and macroeconomic \ndata and modeling under different scenarios. Activities for the preparation of ADO 2009 will also \nbe supported under the TA.  \n  \n7.  To ensure accuracy, coherence, and consistency in approach across the different parts \nof the ADO, high-quality editing services are required. Economic and copy editing activities will \nbe  provided  by  international consultants  working  under  the  direction  of  the  assistant chief \neconomist, ERMF.  \n \n8.  Workshops and training directly relevant to the preparation and strengthening of ADO \ncontent will also be supported by the TA. The focus will be on macroeconomic analysis, growth \naccounting, and economic projections, and effective writing skills, which will target economists \nin regional departments, national officers in resident missions, and, as appropriate, government \nofficials and other client groups. The objective of the training is to equip writers with the skills \nand the tools needed to craft high-quality country chapters. The training will also impart skills \nthat are of broader relevance for economic and sector work that underpins country strategies.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $420,000 (Appendix 3). The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  ADB will be the Executing Agency responsible for implementing and monitoring the TA.  \nIn particular, ERMF will implement the TA in close coordination with regional departments and \nresident missions. The assistant chief economist of ERMF, reporting to the chief economist of \nERD, will be responsible for implementation. Given the high institutional profile of the ADO, ERD \nwill report to the Vice President, Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development Group, \nthe Managing Director General and the President at critical points in its preparation. \n \n11.  The development of analytical tools and approaches to support high-quality ADO content \nwill be a joint effort of ERMF economists, country economists of the regional departments and \nresident missions, national experts, international consultants, and economics editors. The TA \nwill finance the procurement of information and knowledge services as may be required to \nsupport  relevant  and  up-to-date  content.  Procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The TA is expected to start in \nDecember 2007 and to be completed by March 2009. \n ", "  3\n \n12.  An ADO workshop is tentatively scheduled for January 2009 at ADB headquarters. The \nworkshop will present and discuss issues and directions on several topics for consideration and \ninclusion in the subsequent year\u2019s ADO. Contents of country chapters and other issues will also \nbe discussed during the workshop. \n \n13.  An  estimated  10.5  person-months  (approximately  five  consultants)  of  international \nconsultants\u2019 time will be required for economic and technical editing of ADO manuscripts before \nfinal publication of ADO 2008 and ADO 2008 Update. ADO will also require 4 person-months \n(approximately  two  consultants)  of  international  consultancy  resources  for  preparing \nbackground  papers.  Another  6  person-months  (approximately  two  consultants)  of  national \neconomic consultants\u2019 time will be required to assist in preparing country chapters and data \nsheets. The outline terms of reference for the consultants and resource persons are in Appendix \n4. The consultants will be hired as individuals. Resource persons will also be engaged to \nconduct training workshops and prepare background papers on economic trends and prospects \nof selected DMCs. Consultants and resource persons will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n14.  The major results of ADO 2008 and ADO 2008 Update will be disseminated to the media, \nDMC policy makers, and civil society. Dissemination will be coordinated by DER in cooperation \nwith ERMF. Separate launches will be undertaken by resident missions in selected DMCs. Both \nADO 2008 and ADO 2008 Update will be featured on the ADB website and printed copies will \nbe distributed worldwide. In countries where there is limited broadband access, CD-ROMs will \nbe made available through the resident missions. The TA will support translation of ADO into \nChinese and Russian languages to extend its audience in selected DMCs. This will be arranged \nby regional departments in consultation with concerned resident missions and DER. ERMF will \nwork with DER to attempt to capture broader and more useful client feedback.  This activity may \nrequire some limited TA resources. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $420,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Asian Development Outlook 2008, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n ", " 4  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  And Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nInfluence the  Regional and  DER web download  \u2022  Key messages of ADO \nintellectual  international reach of  statistics  are communicated \nenvironment within  ADO      effectively. \nwhich policy    Publicly available  \u2022  ADO reaches target \nformulation occurs  Media coverage and  citation data   audience in the policy \nand promote ADB\u2019s  readership    and development \nreputation as an    ERMF and regional  community. \nauthoritative and  Web downloads   department  \u2022  There is significant \nindependent source    consultations with  degree of interest in \nof knowledge about  ADO citations in  clients in country  DMC outlook. \nthe region.   major newspapers     \n  and publications  External review \nBetter informed and   \nbetter designed \npolicies \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved content  Stronger analytical  Management review  \u2022  Accurate and up-to- \nand quality of ADO  content of ADO and  and guidance  date information is \n2008 and ADO 2008  better analysis of    available for DMCs. \nUpdate  providing in- economic prospects  Regional department   \ndepth, relevant, and    review and inputs  Risks \ntimely assessments  High-quality thematic    \u2022  Economic or other \nof the regional  ADO content  Peer review of content.  shocks that derail \neconomy of Asia and    baseline assumptions, \nthe Pacific, and  Better cohesion and  analysis, and \nindividual DMC  balance among  projections  \neconomies, which  different parts of  \u2022  Staff shortages or skill \ncould  strengthen  ADO 2008 and ADO  deficits \neconomic  2008 Update. \nunderpinnings of   \ncountry programs  Use of ADO content \nand strategies of  in the preparation of \nDMCs   country partnership \nstrategies and \neconomic sector \nwork \nOutputs      Risk \n1.
