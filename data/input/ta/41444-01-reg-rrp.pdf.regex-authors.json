THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam, (ii) a proposed grant to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic  (Lao  PDR),  and  (iii)  a  proposed  administration  of  a  loan  to  be  provided  by  the \nOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Fund for International Development \n(OFID) to the Lao PDR, for the Second Northern Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Transport \nNetwork Improvement Project.  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The \nproject was prepared through an Asian Development Bank (ADB) regional technical assistance \n(TA).1  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  The poor state of such basic infrastructure as roads is a major obstacle to building \nsubregional economic cooperation among the six countries that border the Mekong River. \nUnder the GMS program, which it helped establish in 1992, ADB has supported the creation of \nstrategic transport and economic corridors linking Cambodia, the People's Republic of China, \nthe Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. After a summit of GMS leaders in July 2005 \nhighlighted the key role of comprehensive, efficient cross-border transport in promoting trade, \ninvestment, resource development and sharing, and the free movement of goods and people \nbetween their countries, ADB provided technical assistance to prepare the GMS transport \nsector strategy study.2 The study recommended the establishment of a seamless, well-built, \nmultimodal subregional transport network to fully connect the GMS.3 The sector strategy\u2019s \nobjectives were to complete the transport corridors; coordinate GMS country efforts to develop \nthese transport routes into economic corridors of agricultural diversification, industrialization, \nand employment creation; reduce nonphysical barriers to the movement of people, goods, and \nservices within the subregion; and accelerate the implementation of such arrangements as the \nGMS cross-border transport agreement.  \n \n3.  The GMS cross-border transport agreement was incorporated in the GMS program in \n1999  to  support  trade  facilitation.  The  agreement  covers  various  aspects  of  cross-border \ntransport facilitation in the GMS. All the GMS countries have finalized and signed all annexes \nand  protocols  in  the  agreement,  and  most  countries  have  ratified  all  of  the  annexes  and \nprotocols.4 The agreement is already under initial implementation at three border crossing \npoints  along  the  Lao  PDR\u2013Viet  Nam,  Thailand\u2013Lao  PDR,  and  PRC\u2013Viet  Nam  borders. \nAgreements have been signed on additional border crossings for implementation along the \nPRC\u2013Lao PDR and Cambodia\u2013Viet Nam borders. \n \n4.  The  GMS  Northeastern  Corridor  (stretching  from  Thanh  Hoa  in  northern  Viet  Nam \nthrough northern Lao PDR to Bangkok) is one of the corridors identified in the transport sector \nstrategy study and links northeastern Lao PDR with northern Viet Nam and its seaports. Many \nof the corridor roads between Thanh Hoa and Bangkok are in good condition. Others are now \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

The proposed project will fill \nthis  key  gap.  It  was  accorded  priority  in  the  GMS  transport  sector  study  and  is  strongly \nsupported by the governments of the Lao PDR and Viet Nam, which believe it will strengthen \nthe economies of both countries and help reduce current high poverty rates in the project \nprovinces on both sides of their border. The project is included in the GMS regional cooperation \nbusiness plan for 2010\u20132012.6   \n \n5.  The  midterm  review  of  the  GMS  strategic  framework  (2002\u20132012) 7 found  that \nimprovements in physical connectivity infrastructure in the subregion should be complemented \nby investments that enhance competitiveness. The Lao PDR and Viet Nam governments have \nbegun addressing this need on the Northeastern Corridor by building new border posts at Na \nMeo and Nam Soi where Viet Nam\u2019s Highway 217 and Route 6 in the Lao PDR join. ADB\u2019s \nefforts  along  the  Northeastern  Corridor  include  its  socioeconomic  development  project  for \nThanh Hoa City, approved in 2009,8 and the Small Towns Development Sector Project,9 \ncompleted in 2009, which financed upgrading of urban infrastructure in Xam\u2013Nua in the Lao \nPDR. \n \n6.  The project will address a central need identified by a 2008 evaluation of transport and \ntrade facilitation in the GMS by providing one of the missing infrastructure links that have \nreduced the effectiveness of the GMS network\u2019s completed sections.10 ADB is also responding \nto the assessment of GMS road project evaluations that development of the transport corridors \ninto economic corridors has been slow. The project road\u2019s border crossing is not part of the \ncross-border transport agreement implementation activities. However, the need to boost trade \nthrough the project road\u2019s border crossing will be addressed as part of a proposed ADB cluster \nregional  policy  and  advisory  TA  for  implementing  the  action  plan  for  transport  and  trade \nfacilitation in the GMS, which is to be considered for approval in the fourth quarter of 2010. The \noutputs of this TA are to include better coordinated border management, enhancements in the \nsanitary and phytosanitary regime, strengthening of national and subregional institutions for \ntrade facilitation, and the development of a regional trade logistics strategy. The TA includes the \nNa Meo\u2013Nam Soi border crossing as one of its pilot sites for implementing the action plan.  \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2007.

", "    3 \n7.  The project will also benefit from new activities that ADB has instituted to strengthen the \ndevelopment of economic corridors. The Economic Corridors\u2019 Forum is tasked with raising the \nprofile of economic corridor development in the GMS as well as enhancing collaboration among \nGMS fora and working groups along the GMS economic corridors. As part of the Economic \nCorridors\u2019 Forum, the Governors\u2019 Forum is providing the framework and mechanism for stronger \ncooperation among provincial and local officials as well as the closer engagement of the private \nsector in addressing economic corridor development issues. \n \n8.  An evaluation of the Lao PDR transport sector noted the need to assess the local impact \nof regional road projects.11 The local impact of the project will be assessed through the project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation system. The system will develop and monitor a set of \nindicators reflecting transport costs, tariffs, and mobility that will be used to assess the effects of \nimproved  transport  access,  as  well  as  improvements  in  agricultural  productivity,  economic \nactivity, and the health and education sectors, on communities in the project area. \n \n9.  Road maintenance and vehicle overloading are key issues affecting the sustainability of \nroad projects in Viet Nam and the Lao PDR. Both governments have agreed to maintain the \nproject roads to the national standard. In Lao PDR, this will be done through the use of \nperformance-based  maintenance  contracts.  In  Viet  Nam,  performance-based  maintenance \ncontracts will also be used for the project road, subject to the successful outcome of ongoing \npilot tests of these contracts. MOT will develop a program to control vehicle overloading of \nvehicles on the project road in Viet Nam. To address vehicle overloading in the Lao PDR, scales \nfor  weighing  vehicles  will  be  procured  under  the  project,  and  checkpoints  to  control  the \noverloading of vehicles will be established along the project roads. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The expected impact of the project will be increased international trade on the GMS \nNortheastern Corridor. The expected outcome is more efficient transport across the Lao PDR\u2013\nViet Nam border and on the project sections of the GMS Northeastern Corridor. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The expected outputs of the project are the improvement of the Viet Nam and the Lao \nPDR  project  components  of  the  GMS  Northeastern  Corridor  and  of  road  safety  on  these \nstretches. The improved sections will comprise 196 km of Highway 217 in Viet Nam and 143 km \nof routes 6, 6A, and 6B in the Lao PDR, as well as selected sections of routes 6 and 1C where \nroad safety and alignment will be improved. The project also includes clearance of unexploded \nordnance along the project alignment in Viet Nam and the Lao PDR and procurement of scales \nfor weighing vehicles on the project roads in the Lao PDR to control vehicle overloading. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n12.  The project is estimated to cost $139.7 million, including contingencies, taxes, and \ninterest  during  construction  (Table 1).  The  costs  are  expected  to  be $97.4  million  for  the \nVietnamese component and $42.3 million for the Lao PDR component. Taxes and duties will be \nfinanced by the governments. \n \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2010.

ADB  will  provide  a  loan  of  $75  million  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  for  the \nVietnamese component and the government will provide $22.4 million. ADB will provide a grant \nof  $20  million  from  the  Asian  Development  Fund  for  the  Lao  PDR  component  and  the \ngovernment will provide $10.3 million. Delays in the government providing counterpart financing \nhave caused implementation difficulties on previous road projects in the Lao PDR. However, no \ndelays  are  expected  for  the  government  contribution  for  the  project.  About  29%  of  the \ngovernment share is for taxes and duties generated by the project, and about 17% is for \ncontingences,  which  may  not  be  necessary.  Furthermore,  no  substantial  government \nexpenditures are expected until 2013, when ADB expects government revenues to be about \n35% higher than in 2010. The Government of Lao PDR is also seeking a loan from OFID in the \namount of $12.0 million equivalent. Cofinancing in this amount is included in OFID\u2019s program, \nand formal approval is expected in March 2011. ADB typically seeks approval from its Board of \nDirectors  for  the  administration  of  grant  and/or  loan  funds  from  cofinanciers  only  when \ncofinancing  commitments  are  in  place.  To  facilitate  project  implementation,  the  Board  is \nrequested to approve the administration of the proposed loan in an amount not exceeding the \nequivalent of $12 million from OFID, which is expected to be confirmed subsequent to the date \nof Board approval. Approval from OFID will be reported to the Board in accordance with the \nstandard reporting procedures. The OFID financing will be provided as joint cofinancing and will \nbe administered by ADB. The Government of the Lao PDR has agreed that if the loan does not \nmaterialize it will secure an equivalent amount of financing from other sources or agree to \nreduce the scope of the project accordingly.  \n ", "    5 \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  VIE  LAO  ($ million)  Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  75.00  20.00  95.00  68.00 \nOFID  0.00  12.00  12.00  8.60 \nGovernmenta  22.40  10.30  32.70  23.40 \n  Total    97.40  42.30  139.70  100.00 \nLAO = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, OFID = OPEC Fund for International Development, VIE = Viet \nNam. \na  Taxes and duties to be financed from government resources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The  executing  agency  for  the  Vietnamese  component  will  be  the  MOT.  Project \nmanagement unit (PMU) 1 of the MOT will serve as the PMU. The executing agency for the Lao \nPDR component will be the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT). The Department of \nRoads (DOR), under the MPWT, will be responsible for the direct supervision and execution of \nthe project. The project management division of the DOR, which is responsible for managing all \nDOR projects, will carry out the functions of a PMU. The two executing agencies have extensive \nexperience implementing ADB-financed projects and are capable of implementing the proposed \nproject.  \n \n15.  All procurement will be undertaken in conformity with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Tables 3 and 4 and described in detail in the \nproject administration manual (PAM), which is accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2.  \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements: Viet Nam \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2011\u2013June 2016 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2016 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  State Bank of Vietnam \n(ii)   Executing agency  Ministry of Transport \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Project Management Unit 1; Thanh Hoa Provincial People\u2019s Committee \n(resettlement only) \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Ha Noi \nProcurement  International  3 contracts  $69.5 million \ncompetitive bidding  \nNational competitive  1 contract  $0.6 million \nbidding \nConsulting services  QCBS  1,220 person-months   $6.4 million \nInternational: 120 person-months \nNational: 1,100 person-months \nCQS  20 person-months  $0.2 million \nIndividual  10 person-months  $0.2 million \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting for civil works and goods.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n16.  Traffic forecasts by vehicle type were prepared for the project road sections for 2011\u2013\n2035.  The  forecasts  are  based  on  expected  growth  in  gross  domestic  product,  income \nelasticities of demand, and analysis of regional patterns. The economic analysis was carried out \nfor the project by comparing the with-project and without-project scenarios. In the without-\nproject  scenario,  the  road  is  assumed  to  remain  in  its  present  condition.  The  with-project \nscenario  includes  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  of  the  post-project  road,  according  to \ninternational standards. Project economic costs include the resource costs of road improvement \nand maintenance. The primary economic benefits of the project are vehicle operating cost \n(VOC) savings, generated traffic, and time savings. Economic benefits were calculated using \nthe methodology used for costs. VOC savings will accrue primarily from improvements in the \nroad\u2019s  surface  and  horizontal  and  vertical  alignment  and  from  increased  average  speed. \nGenerated traffic is defined as new traffic induced by lower transport costs due to the project. \nBenefits for generated traffic are estimated at half the value of VOC savings for normal traffic. \nThe  economic  internal  rate  of  return  for  the  project  is  14%,  using  a  12%  discount  rate. \nSensitivity analysis was carried out to test the effects of negative changes in the key parameters \nthat determine the benefits and costs of the project. The economic internal rates of return for the \nalternatives tested under the sensitivity analysis are more than 12%. \n \nB.  Governance \n17.  A governance assessment was carried out for both the Lao PDR and the Viet Nam \nproject components as part of the due diligence. The assessment covered the capacities of the \nMPWT and the DOR in the Lao PDR and the MOT and the PMU1 in Viet Nam, focusing on \nfinancial management, institutional issues, policies and procedures, and risks. While significant ", "    7 \ngovernance issues exist in both countries and both executing agencies, substantial progress \nhas been made over the last several years. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the governments and the executing agencies. In \naddition, the governments have agreed to implement other measures to strengthen governance. \nThese  include  establishment  of  a  grievance-redress  mechanism  for  project-related  issues, \nincluding corruption, and creation of project websites to disclose information on procurement \nand  other  project-related  matters  to  the  public.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  PAM  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2).  \nC.   Poverty and Social \n18.  The project area encompasses poor areas in both Viet Nam and the Lao PDR. An \nestimated 37% of the households in Thanh Hoa, the northernmost province of Viet Nam\u2019s \ncentral coastal region, have incomes under the national poverty line and three of the five \ndistricts that the project road passes through in the province are designated as poor, with \npoverty rates ranging from 24% to 59%. The project road crosses Houaphanh on the Lao PDR \nside  of  the  border,  which  is  the  country\u2019s  fifth  poorest  province  and  where  758  villages, \nsubsiding mostly on upland agriculture, are classified as poor. Five of its eight districts are \namong the country\u2019s 47 poorest.  \n \n19.  In addition to increasing international trade on the GMS Northeastern Corridor, the \nproject will reduce poverty in the project area by providing economic opportunities. The road \nimprovements will give the poor better access to health, education, and other social services. \nTravel times and transportation costs will decrease while household incomes rise due to easier \ntransport of goods and local produce. Some negative social effects are also possible, however. \nTo address the risk of higher rates of HIV transmission and human trafficking of women and \nchildren  that  will  result  from  an  influx  of  construction  workers,  the  project  will  include  an \nHIV/AIDS awareness and human trafficking prevention program. Program activities during the \npreconstruction and initial operations period will be implemented as part of ADB\u2019s TA on HIV \nprevention and infrastructure in the GMS.12 The project will finance these activities during the \nrest of the implementation period. The project\u2019s supervision consultants will also address the \nneed to mitigate the road safety risks that factors such as higher traffic levels and faster speeds \non the project road will raise.  \n \n20.  Gender  and  development.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. The project gender action plan ensures that (i) civil works will employ labor-\nbased technology as much as possible and that all construction and road maintenance activities \nwill set employment targets for women, (ii) women will have basic amenities at construction \nsites and be paid fair wages commensurate with those of men, and (iii) road shoulders will have \nsealed surfaces for women\u2019s safety and to reduce their burdens as they carry goods. The \nproject\u2019s road safety interventions, which will include road safety signs and speed bumps or \nother safety measures to slow traffic in villages, will use community women as facilitators in \ncommunity-based information activities. The HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-trafficking activities \nwill be based on consultation with women and men, will stress gender-sensitive awareness and \ninformation materials, and will include targets for the participation of women as community \nfacilitators and beneficiaries. The project will train executing and implementing agency staff on \ngender issues and include gender indicators in project processes and outputs. \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for HIV Prevention and Infrastructure: Mitigating Risk in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion. Manila (TA 6467-REG). \n ", "8     \n \nD.  Safeguards \n21.  The project\u2019s environmental impact has been classified as category B under ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Based  on  the  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE) \nreports prepared for the Lao PDR and Viet Nam components the project is not expected to have \nsignificant environmental impacts. None of the project roads traverses buffer or core zones of \necologically or culturally protected areas. Two proposed bypasses in Viet Nam are relatively \nshort, ranging from 2 km to 3 km. The adverse environmental impacts will come largely during \nconstruction from dust and noise, surface run-off, erosion, traffic and utility disruptions, potential \noccupational and community health and safety risks, and disposal of excavated materials. Of \napproximately 4 million cubic meters of soil and rock-based material that will come from the \ncutting necessary for road widening in hilly areas in the Lao PDR and about the same volume in \nViet Nam, only about 10%\u201315% can be used for fill on the project. Environmental management \nplans (EMPs) detailing mitigation measures and monitoring activities have been prepared as \npart of the IEEs to avoid or reduce anticipated negative project impacts. These plans also \nrequire the design and supervision consultant (DSC) to draft site-specific EMPs (SEMP) or \nmethod statements during the detailed design phase. The SEMP will include the following sub-\nplans: (i) waste management and spoil disposal plan, (ii) materials management plan, (iii) \ndrainage management plan, (iv) erosion control plan, (v) temporary transport management plan, \n(vi) utilities and irrigation reprovisioning plan, (vii) noise and dust control plan, and (viii) workers \nand public safety plan. The contractor will be required to update these EMPs before work begins \nat the sites.  \n \n22.  In compliance with ADB requirements, public consultations were conducted during IEE \npreparation with stakeholders such as local residents, road users, roadside business owners, \nlocally elected representatives, and local government officials.  The IEEs have addressed the \nissues and concerns these stakeholders raised. To ensure that the project execution complies \nwith the EMPs, the two executing agencies\u2014the MOT in Viet Nam and the MPWT in the Lao \nPDR\u2014will include the EMPs in the tender documents and civil works contracts. The executing \nagencies and PMUs will be assisted by the DSC in monitoring the environmental performance \nof contractors and will submit semiannual environmental monitoring reports to ADB. The DSC \nwill also conduct capacity-building activities with the PMUs on environmental management and \nmonitoring. Such activities will include training workshops, orientations, and on-the-job training. \nEnvironmental assessment and review frameworks have been developed for the Lao PDR and \nViet Nam components to make certain that, if rural roads are added to the scope of the project \nafter  approval,  implementation  will  comply  with  the  provisions  of  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  frameworks  and  IEEs  have  been \nendorsed by the governments. \n \n23.  The project\u2019s resettlement impacts has been classified as category B for Viet Nam and \nLao PDR under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. There are about 8,913 households (35,652 \npeople) in Viet Nam and about 147 households in the Lao PDR which will lose a small portion of \nland.  Only  6  households  will  require  relocation  in  the  Lao  PDR  and  no  relocation  will  be \nnecessary in Viet Nam. The Resettlement Plans have been endorsed and disclosed by MOT in \nViet Nam and MPWT in the Lao PDR. \n \n24.  The project\u2019s impact on indigenous peoples has been classified as category B under \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The ethnic minority populations of the districts closest to \nThanh Hoa City are very small, but ethnic minorities comprise almost the entire population of \nthe two project area districts In Viet Nam closest to the Lao PDR border. The same is true of the ", "    9 \ntwo project area districts on the Lao PDR side of the border. The ethnic communities in the Lao \nPDR have been living along the project road since the 1970s. The project will not (i) affect any \ncustomary rights to resources or land; (ii) negatively affect the socioeconomic status of the \nethnic  groups;  (iii)  reduce  their  cultural  and  community  integrity;  (iv)  affect  their  health, \neducation, livelihood, and/or social security status; or (v) alter or undermine the recognition of \nindigenous knowledge. Impacts on ethnic minorities will be addressed through the Resettlement \nPlans.  The  Resettlement  and  Ethnic  Minorities  Framework  and  Resettlement  and  Ethnic \nCommunities Framework have been endorsed by the MOT in Viet Nam and the MPWT in the \nLao PDR, respectively. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n25.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan, which is accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2. Key project risks include inadequate maintenance of the project \nroads, damage to the project roads from overloaded vehicles, ineffective implementation of \nsafeguards policies, and corruption. The governments have agreed to implement mitigating \nmeasures to address these risks, including assurances that the project roads will be maintained \nto  the  national  standard  through  the  use  of  performance-based  maintenance  contracts, \nestablishment  of  checkpoints  to  control  the  overloading  of  vehicles,  establishment  of  a \ngrievance-redress mechanism for several issues that include safeguards and corruption, and \ncreation of project websites to disclose project-related information to the public. \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe project roads are not  The loan and grant agreements include an assurance that the project roads will \nmaintained adequately.  be maintained to the national standard and will be maintained through the use of \nperformance-based maintenance contracts. \nOverloaded vehicles  Viet Nam will develop a program to control the overloading of vehicles along the \ndamage project roads.  project road, and Lao PDR will set up checkpoints along the project roads to \ncontrol the overloading of vehicles. \nSafeguards policies are not  The executing agencies will establish a grievance-redress mechanism to receive \nimplemented effectively.  and resolve complaints on environment, resettlement, and other project issues.  \nAn independent monitor will be engaged to monitor resettlement activities and \nland acquisition. \nCorruption  The executing agencies will (i) create project websites to disclose information on \nprocurement and other project matters, and (ii) establish a grievance-redress \nmechanism on procurement and other project matters. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.   ASSURANCES \n26.  The governments and the executing agencies have assured ADB that implementation of \nthe project shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM, and loan and grant documents. \n \n27.
