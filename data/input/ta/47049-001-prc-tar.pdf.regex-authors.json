The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical \nassistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to conduct a study on market-based \neco-compensation  mechanisms  in  Beijing.  The  TA  is  included  in  the  country  operations \nbusiness plan, 2013\u20132015 for the PRC.1 ADB fielded a reconnaissance mission in Beijing on \n26\u201327 June 2013 and held discussions with the Beijing Finance Bureau, Beijing Municipal \nBureau of Financial Work, and the China Beijing Environmental Exchange (CBEEX) to clarify \nand  agree  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for the TA.2 The design and monitoring framework of the \nTA is in Appendix 1. \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Healthy ecological systems can provide invaluable goods and services to human well-\nbeing, including carbon storage, biodiversity, and recreational and aesthetic functions. In the \nPRC,  the  least  degraded  and  healthiest  ecological  systems  are  located  in  the  rural  or \nunderdeveloped areas surrounding the urban areas. The government has prioritized economic \ndevelopment and livelihood improvement in these areas to achieve inclusive growth. However, \ndevelopment should not compromise the local ecological systems since this can reduce the \nservices these ecological systems can provide. \n \n3.  Eco-compensation  provides  an  innovative  way  to  attain  urban\u2013rural  integrated \ndevelopment. It allows for rural livelihood improvement while reducing or mitigating some of the \nnegative impacts of development on ecosystems, and it conserves the important services they \nprovide. The idea is to compensate people for refraining from conducting activities that will \ncause serious damage and impair ecosystem services in fragile or economically important \necosystems.  Based  on  accumulated  local  experiences  and  studies,  the  PRC  has  started \ndrafting an eco-compensation ordinance that will provide further guidance for establishing or \noperating eco-compensation programs. ADB has been providing substantial support to this \nlegislative process, as well as its underlying policy studies.3  \n \n4.  Presently, most eco-compensation programs in the PRC are government-driven, relying \nheavily on fiscal transfers between government entities. While this kind of arrangement may be \neffective in certain circumstances, it may not properly reflect the value of ecological services \nprovided and the willingness to pay of the beneficiaries. It could therefore fail to fully exploit the \neconomic efficiency embodied in the principle of eco-compensation. The introduction of market-\nbased mechanisms for eco-compensation is expected to achieve higher economic efficiency as \nthe valuations of service providers and beneficiaries would be better revealed and realized. \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2013\u20132015. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 August 2013.  \n3  ADB. 2012.

(under this TA is a subproject on Developing a Framework for Wetland \nEco-Compensation Mechanisms in Jiangsu Yancheng  Coastal Wetlands). In addition, ADB supported three \ninternational conferences on eco-compensation in the PRC from 2009 to 2011. \n \n \n \n ", "2   \n \n5.  Among the goods and services an ecological system offers, carbon sequestered in land \nand forests accounts for a large share in terms of economic values. In the agricultural sector, \nsoil improvement can increase sequestration. Emission reductions may be achieved through \nchanging cultivars, feed, or composition of livestock and herds, and through other sustainable \nagricultural  practices.  In  the  forestry  sector,  management  practices  that  increase  carbon \nsequestration include conservation, afforestation, or reforestation. Reductions in emissions can \nbe  achieved  through  reduced  impact  logging  and  other  sustainable  forestry  practices.  In \nvoluntary or mandatory carbon trading markets, carbon credits are generally generated through \nmeasurements of the current amounts of carbon sequestered in the soil and trees, and the \npotential additional carbon sequestration is achieved through various management practices. A \nton of carbon reduced generates a single credit. This credit is then sold to offset emissions from \nthe purchaser, or it may be purchased and retired to reduce total emissions. In sum, carbon \nsequestration from the agriculture and forestry sectors is an ecological service that could be \nincorporated into market-based transactions.  \n \n6.  Therefore,  a  natural  starting  point  and  focus  of  developing  market-based  eco-\ncompensation mechanisms would be incorporating carbon sequestration from the agriculture \nand forestry sectors into carbon emission trading markets. Although extensive literature exists \nwith respect to carbon sequestration and eco-compensation mechanisms in various ecosystems, \nmany issues need to be addressed within the PRC context. These include (i) the calculation of \nthe amount of carbon sequestered and the potential for additional sequestration in rural areas of \nBeijing, (ii) the appropriate methodology for verifying the amount of carbon sequestered and \ngenerating carbon credits, (iii) practical ways to incorporate carbon sequestration into a cap-\nand-trade program, (iv) the economic benefits and transaction costs of a carbon trade program \ninvolving  carbon  sequestration,  and  (v)  the  approaches  on  how  market  mechanisms  and \ngovernment-driven eco-compensation programs can better complement each other.  \n \n7.  The proposed TA will address the above issues, with a geographical focus in Beijing \nMunicipality. Beijing was chosen for the following reasons: \n(i)  Beijing is prepared to launch a local carbon trading market by the end of 2013, \none  of  seven  pilot  programs  nationwide.  Of  the  total  allowance,  5%  will  be \nallocated to carbon sequestered in agricultural and forestry sectors, although it is \nunclear  to  policy  makers  and  practitioners  how  the  two  sectors  will  be \nincorporated into the carbon market. The TA will directly contribute to the design \nof the experiment in a timely manner.  \n(ii)  Ecological services provided in the rural area of Beijing are highly valuable and \ncannot  be  easily  replaced,  while  the  need  for  rural  development  remains  a \nchallenge to Beijing. \n(iii)  As a leading city in carbon market development, Beijing\u2019s experience could serve \nas a model for other local governments, and the central government who aims to \ndesign a national market after 2015.  \n(iv)  The TA can build upon the existing assistance provided by ADB to the Beijing \nMunicipality and CBEEX on its strategic development in carbon finance and thus \nextend ADB\u2019s value-addition. 4 \n \n8.

Manila. \n ", "  3 \nemissions  from  agricultural  practices  and  animal  husbandry  are  among  the  key  activities \nhighlighted in the State Council\u2019s document.5 The proposed TA will provide direct support to \nthese  national  priorities.  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132015  specifically \nidentifies  promoting  integrated  rural  and  urban  development  and  the  development  and \ninstitutionalization  of  green  financing  instruments  to  support  PRC\u2019s  inclusive  and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth.6 The  proposed  TA  directly  contributes  to  these  tasks \nthrough developing market-based mechanisms to compensate rural residents for conserving \necological services. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be improved rural ecological systems (as indicated by 1 million tons of \ncarbon credits generated from rural Beijing) and residential livelihoods in Beijing (as indicated \nby the CNY10 million in revenues received by residents of rural Beijing from the sale of carbon \ncredits).  The  outcome  will  be  the  establishment  of  market-based  eco-compensation \nmechanisms in Beijing with major findings and policy recommendations from the TA adopted by \nthe government. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The primary output of the TA will be a main report on developing market-based eco-\ncompensation  mechanisms.  The  report  will  have  four  sub-reports,  which  will  examine  the \nfollowing topics:  \n(i)  Potential  and  valuation  of  carbon  sequestered  in  the  agricultural  and \nforestry sectors in rural Beijing. Specifically, the sub-report will identify the \npossible types of activities to increase carbon sequestration in rural areas of \nBeijing, quantify the existing and potential amounts of carbon sequestrated in \nfarmland and forests, and assess a means to capitalize the sequestered carbon. \n(ii)  Development of a carbon trading market incorporating the forestry and \nagricultural  sectors.  Based  on  a  review  of  international  experience  and \nstrategies of carbon trading markets in the PRC, the sub-report will investigate \nthe effective institutional arrangements to introduce carbon credits derived from \nthe agricultural and forestry sectors into a carbon trading program in Beijing. \n(iii)  Economic analysis of carbon trading involving the agricultural and forestry \nsectors.  The  sub-report  will  assess  the  economic  costs  of  maintaining  and \nincreasing carbon sequestration in rural areas of Beijing, transaction costs for \ntrading carbon credits from the agricultural and forestry sectors, and ways to \ndistribute the revenues from selling carbon credits among contributors.  \n(iv)  Fiscal policies and market-based eco-compensation mechanisms. Issues to \nbe explored include how the fiscal policies and tools can support the carbon \ntrading involving the agricultural and forestry sectors and how the system can \ncomplement existing eco-compensation programs relying on public transfer.     \n \n11.   Based on the major findings and recommendations of the main report, a policy note on \nthe development of market-based eco-compensation mechanisms in Beijing will be prepared \n                                                \n5  State Council. 2012.

Manila.  \n ", "4   \nand presented to key government agencies of Beijing Municipality as well as to the central \ngovernment. The policy note is expected to be adopted by the Beijing Municipal Government for \nthe  establishment  of  carbon  trading  markets  that  incorporate  the  agricultural  and  forestry \nsectors for cost-effective reduction of carbon emissions.  \n \n12.  Under government financing, the TA will also support the executing agency and the \nimplementing  agency,  with  assistance  from  consultants,  to  organize  and/or  participate  in \ninternational conferences on market-based eco-compensation mechanisms for the purpose of \ndisseminating the information and knowledge generated from the TA. The TA will also provide \ncapacity building related to policy and practice of market-based eco-compensation to policy \nmakers and potential stakeholders through study tours and trainings. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The CBEEX will \nprovide $290,000 equivalent in cash to fund study tours, workshops and conferences, and \ntraining.7 The CBEEX will also provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation and utilities, data and documents, site transport and other logistical support, \nand other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Financial Work will be the executing agency and the \nCBEEX will be the implementing agency. The executing agency will provide overall guidance \nand  coordination  among  relevant  government  agencies.  The  implementing  agency  is \nresponsible for carrying out the TA activities and providing counterpart financing. A technical \nmanagement  office  will  be  established  at  the  implementing  agency  for  the  day-to-day \nimplementation and management of the TA.  \n \n15.  The TA will be partially delegated to the executing agency.8 A procurement capacity \nassessment was conducted on the executing agency and implementing agency in 2010 during \nthe preparation of the Study on Beijing Green Finance Development Strategy (footnote 4) by the \nTA project team and the then Central Operations Services Office (now the Operations Services \nand  Financial  Management  Department).  The  assessment  concluded  that  the  agencies\u2019 \ncapacity was satisfactory and that ADB provided substantial support and guidance throughout \nthe implementation process given that it was the first TA to be undertaken by both agencies. \nThere have been no adverse changes to the executing and implementing agencies\u2019 capacity \nsince the assessment was completed. \n \n16.  The proposed TA will be implemented over 18 months, tentatively from 1 October 2013 \nto 31 March 2015. The TA requires an estimated 8 person-months of international and 26 \nperson-months  of  national  consultants  with  expertise  in  the  areas  of  carbon  market \ndevelopment, forestry and agricultural carbon sinks, agricultural economics, rural development, \nand fiscal policy. The outline terms of reference for consultants are provided in Appendix 3.  \n \n                                                \n7  The funds will be managed and administered by the CBEEX. \n8   Based on the Memorandum of Understanding on Enhanced Partnership on TA Delegation to the Executing Agency \nsigned between ADB and the Ministry of Finance of the PRC in November 2009, the delegation is limited to the \nselection, recruitment, and supervision of consultants, while administration of the TA will remain with ADB. \n ", "  5 \n17.  The consultants will be engaged through a consulting firm by the executing agency in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime), using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. The \nsimplified technical proposal approach will be used. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Resource persons will be invited to review the consultants\u2019 outputs and share \nknowledge  during  workshops  and  conferences  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  on \nrecruiting and administering resource persons. \n \n18.  The outputs are expected to be disseminated through (i) a policy note to be presented to \nkey government agencies, (ii) an international conference to be conducted on market-based \neco-compensation  mechanisms,  and  (iii)  training  materials  to  be  produced  that  target \ngovernment agencies and the private sector.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Market-Based Eco-Compensation \nMechanisms in Beijing, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n    Data Sources and   \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms   Risks  \nImpact  By 2020:    Assumption \nImprovement in rural  1 million tons of carbon  Trading volume  Agriculture and forestry \necological systems and  credits generated in the  records at the  carbon credits are \nresidential livelihoods in  rural Beijing area  CBEEX  incorporated into \nBeijing      carbon trading market \n     \nCNY10 million in revenues  Official statistics  Risk \nfrom the sale of carbon    Inadequate market \ncredits received by rural    demand and/or low \nresidents in Beijing  prices for the \nagricultural and \nforestry carbon credits \n \nOutcome  By 2015:     Assumption \nEstablishment of market- Major findings and policy  Presentation and  The national \nbased eco-compensation  recommendations from the  official meeting  government and \nmechanisms in Beijing   study presented to key  minutes  Beijing municipal \ngovernment agencies    government will be \n    continuously \n  committed to \nenhancing market-\nbased approaches for \necological conservation \nand greenhouse gas \nemission reductions \n \nRisk \nTransaction costs or \ncoordination costs are \ntoo large for trading to \nwork \n \nOutputs   By 2014:  Four sub-reports  Assumptions \n1.
