INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will support implementation of the first Supply Chain \nFinance Program of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which the ADB Board of Directors \napproved on 8 November 2012. The TA will be used primarily to engage consultants to conduct \ndue diligence and monitoring of risks, and to help administer the program. The program will \nprovide  guarantees  to  and  debt  financing  (both  without  a  government  guarantee)  through \npartner financial institutions (PFIs) to support payments throughout the supply chain; and will \nenable companies in developing member countries (DMCs) to improve their cash flow, thereby \nenabling growth and job creation.1  \n \n2.  The Board approved a program limit of up to $200,000,000 at any time. Such financing \nsupport will be on a rolling basis. Guarantees and loans will be provided to and through PFIs to \ncover the risk of nonpayment under supply chain transactions. These loans and guarantees will \nbe matched in equal or greater amounts by the PFI to the same obligors. ADB will assume \ncorporate  risk,  including  that  related  to  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs),  in \nconjunction with PFIs.  ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department, which is implementing the \nprogram, will conduct its own due diligence and internal approval process on these underlying \nrisks involving ADB\u2019s Office of Risk Management. \n \n3.  The program is regional and aims to encompass as many DMCs as possible, including \nthose benefiting from Asian Development Fund resources. While ADB will make every effort to \ndiversify its geographic exposure and support, the program will nonetheless be linked to where \nPFIs have supply chain financing (SCF) exposure. The design and monitoring framework can \nbe found in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Unlike the advanced \u201cjust-in-time\u201d efficiencies obtained in the physical supply chain \nsince  the  1990s,  the  financial  supply  chain  is  still  primarily  a  manual,  nonintegrated,  and \ninefficient process. Under the current system, cash flow for working capital is trapped in the \nsupply chain, undermining the ability of DMC companies, especially SMEs, to expand and \ncreate more jobs. For example, having to wait for payment as long as 6 months after shipment \nmay mean having to shut down operations, which runs the risk of losing new contracts and \ndelaying the processing of existing orders in the meantime. Receiving cash flow even just 30 \ndays earlier could make a substantial difference\u2014DMC companies would have a steady flow of \nworking capital to maintain production capacity, retain staff, and ultimately expand operations \nand employ more people. \n \n5.  While ADB has developed a strong capacity to support trade, including among SMEs \nthrough its Trade Finance Program, there are gaps in ADB\u2019s offerings and capacity to support \nSMEs in real sector supply chains, which the Supply Chain Finance Program can fill. Unlike the \nTrade Finance Program, the Supply Chain Finance Program will assume corporate risk, not \nbank risk, and will support domestic as well as cross-border supply chains. \n \n6.  SCF has the potential to minimize the two greatest impediments to DMC companies \naccessing finance: low credit rating and lack of collateral. Unlike traditional risk assessments \n                                                \n1 The first three PFIs are anticipated to be Standard Chartered Bank, BNP Paribas, and Citibank. \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 October 2013. \n ", "2   \nthat focus almost exclusively on financials and collateral, SCF focuses its assessment on the \nstrength and longevity of a supply chain, and the mutual dependence between buyer and \nsupplier. In assessing risk and working with PFIs to finance supply chains, the TA will inspire \nthis shift in thinking, which should result in more systemic support for DMC companies long after \nADB\u2019s obligations and liabilities under the program are discharged by 31 August 2018. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n7.  The TA will be used primarily to support the implementation of the SCF by engaging \nconsultants to conduct due diligence and performance monitoring of companies. In addition, \nconsultants engaged under the TA will help administer the program.  \n \n8.  An important element of the TA, and a feature that also distinguishes the Supply Chain \nFinance Program from the Trade Finance Program, concerns its proposed focus on assessing \nand monitoring SME and corporate risk. ADB currently lacks experience in assessing and \nmonitoring this risk, which impedes its ability to implement projects directly impacting DMC \ncompanies. The TA, which will be critical to the implementation of the program, will focus on \nobligor risk assessments, and monitoring and administration of SCF transactions. While the \nprimary beneficiary of the TA will be DMC companies through the resulting program financing, \nan ancillary beneficiary will be ADB itself. ADB\u2019s own technical capacity in working with DMC \ncompanies will be enhanced and this will position ADB to consider and implement new SME-\nsupporting projects in the future. \n \n9.  SCF is linked to the ADB Financial Sector Operational Plan,3 to various strategies and \nbusiness  opportunities  presented  in  country  partnership  strategies,  regional  cooperation \nstrategies  (i.e.,  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  and  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic \nCooperation),  and  country  operations  business  plans.  A  review  of  these  documents \nunderscores the importance of trade finance capacity development in DMCs to enable ADB to \nmeet its development objectives. An overview of some of the specific country and regional \nstrategies  and  business  plans  with  direct  links  to  the  TA  is  provided  in  a  supplementary \nappendix. \n   \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be broader access to SCF for companies in DMCs.  Access to SCF for \nDMC companies is expected to increase by 25% by 2020.  The outcome will be partner financial \ninstitutions broadening their SCF portfolio.  By providing resources required to implement the \nprogram, it is anticipated that at least $500 million (ADB\u2019s portion of risk: $200 million on a \nrevolving basis) will be provided as SCF to DMC companies between 2013 and 2018.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will enable ADB to engage consultants to assist ADB in the implementation of \nthe program. Consultants will be hired to conduct the following key activities critical to the \nimplementation of the program: \n(i)  conduct in-depth due diligence and risk analysis on DMC companies in which ADB \nwould assume risk under the program; \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2011.

The TA will have three outputs: \n(i)  Establish  the  program,  with  approximately  four  PFIs  enrolled  by  2015.  The \nprogram will mobilize private sector funds for SCF in DMCs by sharing risk and \nworking  in  cooperation  with  PFIs.  As  the  TA  is  critical  to  implementing  the \nprogram, it will play a pivotal role in developing partnerships that will result in \nmore support to DMC companies and therefore economic growth, job creation, \nand ultimately poverty alleviation. \n(ii)  Improve knowledge of SCF among key government officials, financial institutions, \nand entrepreneurs who will be trained on the functions and benefits of SCF in \ntwo seminars to be conducted by 2015. SCF is at an early stage of development \nin DMCs. Even for countries with more developed finance sectors, the availability \nof SCF is limited. The seminars will contribute to the development of SCF in \ncountries where it is still at a nascent stage of development. \n(iii)  Increase the number of DMC companies with access to SCF from PFIs by 3% by \n2015.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which (i) $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund4 and administered by ADB; and \n(ii) $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration \nFund.5  \n \n14. The TA will cover remuneration, travel, and per diem for international consultants, national \nconsultants, conference-related expenditures, and miscellaneous expenses. A detailed cost \nbreakdown and proposed financing plan are presented in Appendix 2. \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will require about 96 person-months of individual consulting inputs from two \ninternational and two national consultants. Recruitment of consultants will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Consultants \nengaged under the TA will work in ADB headquarters, and extensive travel is expected. In \naddition  to  conducting  due  diligence,  drafting  credit  applications,  monitoring  risk,  and \nadministering the program, consultants and resource persons may be engaged by ADB to \nconduct seminars or training. Terms of reference for the consultants are provided in Appendix 3. \nEquipment (smartphones and data and communication plans) will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and will be retained \n                                                \n4  Contributor: the Government of Luxembourg. \n5  Established by ADB. \n ", "4   \nby ADB following TA completion. Implementation is anticipated by end January 2014 with the \nsigning of a supply chain finance agreement with a partner financial institution. Disbursements \nunder the agreement are anticipated by end first quarter 2014.  Due diligence and risk analysis \non companies, and administration and monitoring of the program will be performed on an on-\ngoing basis from Q1 2014 to October 2015. \n \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency while the Private Sector Operations Department will \nadminister and implement the TA. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with \nADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n17.  The grant of $800,000 will be used to start implementation of the program.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund; and (ii) ADB \nproviding the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis, both for \nCapacity Development for the Supply Chain Finance Program, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risksa  \nImpact      Assumptions \nBroader access to  Number of companies in  Statistics from PFIs and  Continued growth in \nSCF for companies in  DMCs with access to SCF  reports requested by the  demand for SCF \ndeveloping member  increases by at least 25%  program   \ncountries  by 2020 (2012 baseline to    Risks \nbe established through  Statistics from central  High costs associated \nindustry sector survey)  banks in DMCs (as  with establishing a \navailable)  reliable information \ntechnology \ninfrastructure to support \nSCF \nOutcome      Assumptions \nPFIs broaden their  At least $500 million  Program statistics  PFIs remain in a \nSCF portfolio  (ADB\u2019s portion of risk:    position to support DMC \n$200 million revolving)  Statistics from PFIs and  companies with SCF \nprovided as SCF to DMC  reports requested by the   \ncompanies between 2013  program  Risk-sharing \nand 2018b  arrangements continue \n  between financial \n  institutions and \n  guarantee providers \n   \nRisk \nPFIs expand their SCF \nagenda less than \nanticipated \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
