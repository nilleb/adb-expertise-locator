Energy is vital to support economic growth necessary for raising the \nliving standards of large populations and at present this comes mainly from fossil fuels. The \ncurrent energy path, which focuses on expanding fossil fuel supplies, is neither environmentally \nnor economically sustainable. Increasing energy efficiency, to ensure more service value from \neach primary energy unit consumed, has significant environmental and economic benefits. \nEnergy efficiency is essential to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), ease \ngrowth in fossil energy demand, curb the upward pressure on energy prices, and improve \nenergy security. \n \n2.  Measures are needed first to slow the growth of worldwide GHG emissions, followed by \nefforts to reverse growth trends. This will require a shift from the present fossil-fuel- dominated \neconomy to one with an efficient and prudent fuel mix. More investments need to be made in \nmany  diverse  and  distinct  market  segments,  on  both  the  supply  and  demand  sides\u2014all \ntargeting the creation of a low-carbon sustainable energy future.  \n \n3.  Taking into account the growing importance of energy efficiency, ADB launched the \nenergy efficiency initiative (EEI) in July 2005 to expand its operations in energy efficiency to \n$1 billion a year, both on the supply side (including supporting increased use of renewable \nsources) and on the demand side (including promoting greater end-use efficiency). The EEI is \nbeing  implemented  in  three  phases.  Phase  I  was  completed  in  June  2006  with  the  ADB \nManagement\u2019s endorsement of the draft EEI report. The report firmly established the rationale \nfor expanded and sustained ADB action and investment in energy efficiency, while defining the \ngeneral principles of the energy efficiency investment. It included an action plan, a list of \npriorities, and a framework for subsequent steps. During clean energy week (20\u201322 June 2006), \nDMC officials and international experts also provided support to the EEI. Phase II (from June \n2006 to December 2007) will (i) develop country-level and regional strategies and action plans \non how to reach the target set for the EEI, (ii) explore the possibility of establishing the Asia \nPacific Fund for Energy Efficiency (APFEE), and (iii) develop the necessary institutional capacity \nwithin ADB to scale-up as well as to monitor and evaluate activities implemented under the EEI. \nImmediate energy efficiency investment opportunities will also be pursued during phase II. The \nstrategies and action plans will be implemented in phase III (2008\u20132010). The concept paper for \nthis  regional  technical  assistance  (RETA)  was  approved  by  Vice  President,  Knowledge \nManagement and Sustainable Development on 27 July 2006.1 The concept paper for the RETA \nwas  for  $2.9  million,  which  was  to  cover  the  inception  phase  and  also  finance  the \nimplementation of EEI phase II.  However, only $600,000 is available in 2006.  Therefore the \nRETA will be used for the inception of EEI phase II (as outlined above) in ADB\u2019s DMCs. The \nRETA will develop a detailed workplan and country consultations will be held.  The remaining \n$2.3 million will be available in 2007.  Follow-on technical assistance (TA) or supplemental TA \nwill be processed in 2007 to undertake the activities identified by the RETA.  \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  The rationale for the EEI and the justification for developing more energy efficiency \nprojects is based on an analysis of current and future projections of energy use patterns in the \nAsia and Pacific region. Factors that affect energy use in the region are listed in Appendix 1.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 31 July 2006. \n ", "2   \n5.  Promoting energy efficiency will slow the growth of GHG emissions without sacrificing \neconomic gains or living standards. Improving supply and energy use efficiencies will directly \nlower the cost of energy services, and thereby create financial savings. At the same time, lower \nfossil fuel use and an increased share of renewable energy will create additional environmental \nand economic benefits in terms of (i) lower GHG emissions, (ii) reductions in other pollutants \nand improvements in local air quality, (iii) reduced upward pressure on international fuel prices, \nand (iv) diversification of energy sources through energy efficiency investments, contributing to \nenergy  security.  Energy  efficiency  can  achieve  success  on  many  fronts  and  needs  to  be \nstrategically targeted at the national, enterprise, and household levels. The efforts to promote \nenergy efficiency have to be radically scaled up if its technical and economic potential is to be \nrealized. \n \n6.  The  international  community  is  strongly  promoting  energy  efficiency  as  a  way  of \naddressing climate change. The Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change (UNFCCC) came into force on 16 February 2005 and includes the Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism (CDM).  CDM was established to provide financial incentives to boost \ninvestments in GHG abatement projects, such as those covering renewable energy and energy \nefficiency in developing countries. The G8+5 Gleneagles Summit in July 2005 gave the clean \nenergy and climate change agenda new momentum. Following the summit\u2019s joint communiqu\u00e9, \nthe World Bank has led consultations among the international financial institutions (IFIs) to \nprepare an investment framework for clean energy and development. Similarly, a six-country \nAsia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, comprised of Australia, India, \nJapan,  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  Republic  of  Korea,  and  the  United  States, \nannounced its program during its inaugural minister-level meeting in January 2006. Special \nfunds, such as the Global Environment Facility, have been established, although there are \nlimitations on the use of these based on grant criteria and allocation formulas. The International \nEnergy Agency (IEA) is carrying out extensive technical studies and has many special programs \non  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy.  The  IEA  also  provides  guidance  on  strategy, \nrationale, and policies based on long-term energy projections and technology choices. The \nglobal drive toward sustainable energy was also bolstered through the consensus reached at \nthe  World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002, and the subsequent \nInternational Conferences for Renewable Energy in 2004 (Bonn) and 2005 (Beijing). Moreover, \nclean energy is a high priority for several development organizations, including the French \nAgency for Environment and Energy Management; Germany\u2019s Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau \nBankengruppe; Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit; the UK Department for \nInternational Development; the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency; and \nCanadian, Danish, Dutch, and Japanese development agencies.2  \n \n7.  ADB held two consultation meetings with stakeholders from DMCs in November 2005 \nand June 2006. At these meetings it was clear that DMCs also recognize the urgency and \nrationale for significant improvements and investments in energy efficiency. 3 Several countries \nhave adopted aggressive policies.  For example, although the goal of PRC is to increase its \ngross domestic product (GDP) by four times between 2000 and 2020, it plans to only double \nenergy use in the same period.4 India has adopted a comprehensive energy efficiency policy \nand defined methods (such as mandatory audit programs) for expanding energy efficiency in \nenergy-intensive industries, government buildings and facilities, and utility demand management \n                                                 \n2  The current wide support for energy efficiency is conducive for raising donor funds. \n3  See, for example, comments from the PRC during an EEI consultative workshop, 22 November 2005.  \n4  Zhaoguang, Hu. 2005. Opportunities for Energy Efficiency in China. Paper presented at ADB Energy Efficiency \nConsultative Workshop, ADB, Manila, 22 November. \n ", "  3\nprograms. DMCs have strongly requested assistance to improve their energy efficiency policies \nand programs and make them operational.  \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s EEI is part of its comprehensive program on Clean Energy and Environment \nProgram (CE&EP) to assist its DMCs to achieve significant and measurable change in their \nenergy  use  patterns  and  secure  a  low-carbon  sustainable  energy  future.  The  CE&EP  will  \ncomprise activities in several areas:5 (i) the EEI, as outlined above; (ii) the carbon market \ninitiative (CMI) to use the emerging carbon market to catalyze funds for the implementation of \nclean energy projects in the Asia and Pacific region; (iii) the energy efficiency in transport \ninitiative (EET), which has sought to broaden ADB\u2019s engagement with DMCs on climate change \nimplications of road transportation; (iv) the establishment of \"knowledge hubs\" for awareness \nraising and capacity building on clean energy;6 (v) management of the Canadian, Danish, Dutch, \nand Finnish channel financing facilities for increasing access to energy, renewable energy, and \nenergy  efficiency  under  the  Renewable  Energy,  Energy  Efficiency,  and  Climate  Change \n(REACH) Program; and (vi) organization of an annual clean energy week to bring together \npolicy makers, practitioners, financiers, and other stakeholders in the Asia and Pacific region to \nshare knowledge and best practices. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  impact  of  the  RETA  will  be  to  decrease  the  rate  of  climate  change  through \nincreased use of sustainable energy. The outcomes will be (i) the design of the implementation \nframework for phase II of the EEI agreed upon by ADB and participating DMCs, (ii) the detailed \ndesign of the APFEE, and (iii) the initial development of a project development and monitoring \nand evaluation (M&E) system for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in ADB. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  ADB  will  carry  out  the  work  under  the  RETA  through  two  distinct  components. \nComponent 1 will prepare energy efficiency strategies and investments by (i) prioritizing the \nDMCs with the greatest potential for energy efficiency investments; (ii) prioritizing sectors in \nselected DMCs; (iii) developing country-level work plans7 for priority sectors in selected DMCs; \n(iv)  developing  work  plans  to  establish  a  regional  framework  for  the  EEI  phase  II;  and \n(v) reviewing ADB\u2019s energy and non-energy sector projects from the past 2 years with the \nobjective of improving the monitoring of investments that ADB has made in energy efficiency but \nwhich were not tracked as energy efficiency projects. Component 2 will begin the detailed \ndesign of the APFEE through consultations with DMCs and donors and internal deliberations in \nADB.  The outline terms of reference are attached in Appendix 3. \n                                                 \n5  EEI, CMI and EET activities also contribute towards the investment framework on climate change under the Group \nof Eight (G8) Gleneagles\u2019 Action Plan on Climate Change, Clean Energy and Sustainable Development, which was \nagreed in July 2005.   \n6  Such hubs are currently being established with The Energy Research Institute in New Delhi, India; Asian Institute \nof Technology in Bangkok, Thailand; and Tshinghua University in Beijing, PRC.  \n7  The detailed country-level energy efficiency investment and action plans, which may consider specific technical, \neconomic, financial, legal and policy support if needed to support EEI through phase III, and the proposed energy \nefficiency monitoring and evaluation system will be prepared under a supplemental RETA for the remainder EEI \nphase II activities in 2007.   \n ", "4   \n11.  Component  1  will  provide  the  groundwork  for  the  strategic  allocation  of  the  RETA \nresources for the remainder of the EEI phase II activities. The requisite preparatory work will \ninvolve  the  prioritization  of  countries  that  have  the  greatest  potential  for  energy  efficiency \ninvestments, the gathering of information8 related to the policies, regulations, incentives and \ndisincentives that are in place for promoting energy efficiency, and the drafting of a list of \npotential  types  of  energy  efficiency  projects  falling  under  the  following  major  categories: \n(i) supply-side energy efficiency such as power generation, transmission and distribution as well \nas grid-connected and off-grid renewable energy; (ii) end-use energy efficiency in industry \n(including cleaner production technologies); buildings (commercial, institutional, and residential \nsectors); urban and municipal utility services (street lighting, district heating, gas distribution, \nwater supply, waste and sewerage infrastructure); irrigation (e.g., efficient pumps, foot valves \nand piping); and through energy efficiency standards and labeling (for equipment, lighting and \ndomestic appliances); and, (iii) energy efficiency in the transportation sector (such as biofuel \nuse, urban mass transit, and newer vehicle technologies). \n \n12.  Component 2 will begin the detailed design of the APFEE.  The APFEE is a proposed \nfund of $500 million with three facilities: \n(i)  a credit enhancement facility to finance smaller energy efficiency investments \nthat require quick and efficient transactions;  \n(ii)  a technology transfer facility to finance the technology transfer costs of clean \ntechnologies for a small number of high-impact large interventions that will help \nestablish energy efficiency technologies; and  \n(iii)  a  technical  assistance  facility  that  provides  grant  assistance  for  non-lending \nmeasures, such as developing the knowledge base and incentive mechanisms, \nadvocacy,  institutional  capacity  building,  and  project  preparation,  and \nestablishing the M&E mechanism.  \n \n13.  The APFEE design work will include extensive consultations.   \n(i)  Discussions  will  be  held  with  potential  borrowers  from  industry,  owners  of \ncommercial  buildings,  utilities,  municipalities,  and  local  financing  institutions. \nThese will focus on the potential demand for such a fund, and the most efficient \nmeans to design its structure and operations.  \n(ii)  Donors will be consulted to determine their requirements for supporting such a \nfund and their views on the choice of a governance and reporting structure.  \n(iii)  Within  ADB,  a  working  group  has  been  formed  to  design  the  structure  and \noperational requirements of the APFEE. The working group will hold detailed \ndiscussions  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  and  social  safeguards  division,  the \nTreasury and Controller\u2019s Departments, as well as the Office of the General \nCounsel to ensure the optimal design for the fund\u2019s operational structure.  \n \n                                                 \n8  In general, information will be gathered on a country-level basis. There may be cases, however, where sub-\nnational or provincial investigation of policy frameworks will be necessary. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000. It will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 4. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency for the RETA. The Energy, Transport and Water \nDivision (RSID) of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD) will oversee \nthe overall administration of the RETA. All country-level and energy efficiency project-based \nactivities under the RETA will be performed in close coordination with operations departments9 \nas  they  have  the  technical  knowledge  and  the relationships  with  the  relevant  government \nagencies and stakeholders in the DMCs.  Operations departments will prioritize the countries \nand the activities to be carried out and identify the methodology to be used (i.e., whether to \npursue a country-by-country strategy or work with several countries together). RSID will then \nprovide support and assistance to operations departments to identify consultants for each task \n(if required), define the specific terms of reference for each consultant, and undertake the \nprocess for retaining the consultant and managing the contract. RSID will also develop standard \ntemplates for the types of data to be gathered and formats of the consultants\u2019 reports to ensure \nconsistency. Where appropriate, operations departments will oversee the technical outputs of \nthe consultants. RSID will compile the outputs of the various contracts into a cohesive set of \ncountry  strategies  and action  plans.  The  local  counterparts  in  the  various  DMCs  will  vary \ncountry by country, sector by sector, and also between the public and private sectors. \n \n16.  RSID will take the lead in the RETA activities related to the development of the APFEE \nand will work in close coordination with the operations departments, Controller\u2019s Department, \nTreasury Department, Office of the General Counsel, Office of Cofinancing Operations and \nother relevant departments and offices. RSID has prepared the first draft of the information \nmemorandum that outlines the rationale, structure and proposed operations of the APFEE. It will \nbe used for further consultations with donors and potential clients and internally in ADB to \nenable the design of the APFEE to be finalized after the RETA has been completed. \n \n17.  The RETA will begin in September 2006. It will be carried out over 6 months and will be \ncompleted  by  March  2007.  The  RETA  will  require  an  estimated  16  person-months  of \ninternational consulting services and about 24 person-months of national consulting services. \nThe engagement of consultants will be phased in accordance with the sequence of activities. \nThe international consultants will be expected to spend 90% of their time in the field. Consulting \nwork and output will be defined by RSID for each work component. It is expected that individual \nconsultants will mainly be recruited for the RETA because of the need to source specialized \ntechnical and sectoral energy efficiency expertise as well as specific-country energy efficiency \nexpertise, and the short implementation period. If a firm is required to carry out part of the terms \nof reference, it will be selected in accordance with the quality-and-cost-based selection (QCBS) \nmethod with biodata technical proposals. The recruitment of consultants will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.   \n \n \n                                                 \n9  In the context of this RETA, operations departments refer to the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) \nand the energy and infrastructure divisions, transport divisions, and urban development divisions of the regional \ndepartments that may have energy efficiency projects. \n ", "6   \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of regional technical assistance, not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000, on a grant \nbasis for Supporting the Inception of the Energy Efficiency Initiative in Developing Member \nCountries, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \n \n \nFACTORS THAT AFFECT ENERGY USE IN THE ASIA AND PACIFIC REGION \n \n1.  Energy use patterns in the Asia and Pacific region are driven by the following factors.   \n \n(i)  Rapid Economic Growth and Larger Share of World Energy Use. The total \nprimary energy supply (TPES) for the Asia and Pacific region was 2,655 million \ntons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2003, representing 25% of the world\u2019s total energy \nconsumption.  In  1973,  figure  was  804  Mtoe,  only  13.3%  of  the  world  total. \nBetween 1973 and 2003, Asian energy consumption rose 230%, compared with \nan average worldwide increase of 75% during the same period, reflecting the \nAsia and Pacific region\u2019s dramatic economic growth.1  \n(ii)  High Projected Growth in Energy Use.  The growth of the Asia and Pacific \nregion\u2019s energy use has outpaced that in the rest of the world\u2014a trend that is \nexpected to continue. From 2003 to 2030, it is estimated that energy use in the \nAsia and Pacific region will increase by 89% to 5,016 Mtoe, and will account for \nan estimated 30% of world consumption.  \n(iii)  Manufacturing and Urban Migration. The Asia and Pacific region\u2019s increasing \nenergy  use  is  driven  in  part  by  strong  regional  growth  in  manufacturing \n(frequently  shifted  from  industrialized  countries)  and  rural-to-urban  migration. \nThese  long-established  trends  are  expected  to  continue.  Further,  urban \npopulations tend to adopt higher-energy lifestyles, reinforcing the energy use \ngrowth trends.  \n(iv)  Growing  Share  of  Worldwide  Greenhouse  Gas  (GHG)  Emission.  The \ndominance  of  fossil  fuels  in  the  region  has  increased  the  Asia  and  Pacific \nregion\u2019s share of worldwide GHG emissions from 8.7% in 1973 to 24.4% in 2003. \nThe region\u2019s share is expected to continue to increase to 28% by 2010 and \n30.4% by 2030.  \n(v)  Relatively Low Efficiency in Energy Use. Most countries remain inefficient in \ntheir use of energy resources across most major industries. These inefficiencies \nare a major burden on the region\u2019s economies, particularly owing to high levels of \nfuel imports.2  \n(vi)  Relatively Low Per Capita Energy Consumption. Energy use per capita per \nyear in the Asia and Pacific region, excluding the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), is 0.61 Mtoe. Energy use per capita per year is 1.10 Mtoe in the PRC, \n4.67  Mtoe  for  members  of  the  Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and \nDevelopment (OECD), and the world average is 1.69 Mtoe. Energy use per \ncapita must increase to meet the legitimate aspirations of the people to improve \ntheir lives.  \n(vii)  Limited  Access  to  Energy  Services.  Across  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region, \napproximately 1.7 billion people rely on traditional biomass fuels for cooking. \nSuch fuels have negative health and environmental impacts. Further, over 1 \n                                                 \n1  International Energy Agency (IEA). 2005. Key World Energy Statistics. IEA, Paris. The IEA definition of TPES \nincludes estimates for non-commercial subsistence biomass energy use. Since a large part of the rural Asian \npopulation continues to use biomass energy, the IEA definition de-emphasizes the share attributable to fossil fuels \ncompared with the definitions of other statistical methods, which calculate TPES solely as commercial energy. The \nIAE definition of the Asia and Pacific region does not include Japan or Republic of South Korea. \n2  Energy use in Asia per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) when corrected for purchasing power parity is similar \nto OECD countries, but this is not the case for delivered goods or services, i.e., energy used per unit of output \nmeasured in physical terms, e.g., tons of steel.  \n ", "8  Appendix 1 \nbillion people in the Asia and Pacific region lack access to electricity,3 which \nlimits  their  prospects  for  development,  education,  and  livelihood.  Providing \naccess to energy services is essential to reduce poverty.  \n(viii)  Large Need for Energy Investment. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has \nestimated the worldwide need for investments in energy capital infrastructure of \napproximately $16 trillion through 2030.
