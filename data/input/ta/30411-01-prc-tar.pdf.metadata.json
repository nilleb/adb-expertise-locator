During the March 1998 Country Programming Mission, the Government\nof the People's Republic of China (PRC) reconfirmed its request for Bank technical\nassistance (TA) for policies and a regulatory framework for the construction industry. A\nFact-finding Mission visited the PRC from 9 to 2 March 1998 and reached an\nunderstanding with the Government regarding the objectives, scope, costs, terms of\nreference, and implementation arrangements for the TA. This Report is based on these\nunderstandings and the Mission's observations 1\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Since the adoption of economic reform measures in 1978, the\nconstruction industry in the PRC has grown rapidly to become the third pillar in the\nnational economy after manufacturing and agriculture. The value added in the\nconstruction industry is forecast to reach $120 billion by 2010, which will account for 6\npercent of the gross domestic product. The annual turnover for international projects\nand labor service is expected to reach $10 billion.\n3. While experiencing rapid growth, the construction industry has not\ndeveloped sufficiently in terms of productivity and quality of work. At present there are\nover 71,230 registered construction enterprises n the PRC of which 2,380 are\nregistered in the highest grade. This represents only 3.3 percent of the total, which is\nsmall by international comparison\n4 The problems encountered by the construction industry include (i)\ncontractors tending to be too specialized and not able to offer a diverse range of\nservices, (ii) the quality of bidding is not up to international standards, (iii) estimates are\nbased on Government regulations and pricing structures, rather than market prices and\nactual site conditions, and (iv) the number of experienced managerial and technical\npersonnel is insufficient to meet the demands of the ndustry.\n5. Despite the growth of the construction industry, it has failed to reach\ninternational standards in terms of bid preparation and contract execution. The industry\nis deficient in terms of pricing structure, work methods, scheduhng, resourcing, and\nconstruction management. This results in delays in project implementation, cost\noverruns, and poor quality control. While such deficiencies exist in the industry in the\nPRO, these have not been insurmountable because of assistance provided by local\ngovernment authorities and executing agencies, which has generally resulted in\nsuccessful project implementation. However, internationally, many contracts have\nexperienced inordinate delays in mobilization and project implementation. In some\ncases it has led to the termination of the contract The overall result has been that\nmany employers would like to avoid entering into contracts with contractors from the\nPRO.\n6. Against this background, the Government has requested the Bank to\nprovide TA to strengthen the governance system and provide capacity building for the\nconstruction industry. Such assistance will enable the construction industry to meet the\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities ir March 199T\n-\t -\t - _-\t --\t -\n-\n- .\t -\t -\t - -\n-\t -\t -\t -\n-\t -\t\n-\t -\t -\n-\t -\t -\t -\n-\n!rt \u2022\t f\u2022JI..1I\u2022A\t JA.AL 1VJL\n- - - -\t - - - -\t -- - - \n_i__-\t- \t - -\n-\t -\t - -\t - -\t -\t - -\t -\t .\t -\n._,l_._____._,__ -- - - -\t - -\t -\t - - . - - - - - - -\n_p\t\n- -", "requirements of market-based economies by improving the Government's regulatory\ncontrol of the industry and improving the management skills, competitiveness, and\nbusiness practices of the industry.\nIII.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n7. The objective of the TA is to strengthen the governance system and provide\ncapacity building for the construction industry to enhance its performance both within the\nPRO and internationally. The TA framework is in Appendix 1\nB.\t Scope\n8. Under the TA, an international firm of consultants will examine and\nreview the present policies and the regulatory framework, and develop proposals to\nmeet the objectives of the TA. The consultants will assist the Government in\nstrengthening the national register of contractors using a computerized database.\nContractors will be further classified according to their ability to execute contracts both\nwithin the PRO and internationally, based on experience, past performance, financial\ncapacity, and management and technical capability. To assist in the capacity building of\nthe construction industry, the TA will include a pilot training program for contractors on\nestimating prices, international bidding procedures, construction management, and\ninternationally accepted construction practices.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n9. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $785,000 equivalent, comprising\n$450,000 in foreign exchange and $335,000 equivalent in local currency. The Bank will\nprovide $570,000 equivalent to finance, on a grant basis from the Bank-funded TA\nprogram, the entire foreign exchange cost of $450,000 and $120,000 equivalent of the\nlocal currency cost. The foreign exchange will finance the remuneration, international\nand domestic travel, per diem, and out-of-pocket expenses of the international\nconsultants; computer hardware and software; office equipment; reports and training\ncourse material; communications; miscellaneous administration and support costs for\nthe consultants; and the cost of any observers at the negotiation. The local currency\nexpenditures to be financed by the Bank include remuneration, travel, and per diem for\ndomestic consultants; reports and training course material; translation costs; and pilot\ntraining course workshops. The Government agreed to finance the remaining local\ncurrency cost of $215,000 equivalent in kind and serces The cost estimates and\nfinancing plan is in Appendix 2.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n10. The Ministry of Construction (MOon), the Executing Agency, will be\nresponsible for implementing the TA. To reflect the interest of other concerned\ngovernment agencies, a TA steering committee will be established to guide\nrnplementation of the TA with participation of senior representatives from the People's\nBank of China; the ministries of Communications, Railways, Foreign Trade and\n.\" \n-, -'\t I I II I\t -\t V >( I / _4 4\nI r\\r\t II' ,-' .. -' , I-\t IL I\t -\t .',!

A TA project director, to be\nnominated by MOon, will be (i) the party to whom all notices and communications will\nbe addressed, (ii) the liaison between the steering committee and other relevant\ngovernment agencies, and (iii) the liaison between the consultants and the Bank.\nMCon will assign adequate counterpart staff to work with the consultant team under the\nleadership of the Project director. In addition, MOon will make available existing data\nthat is relevant to the TA, and will provide the consultants, when in the PRO, with\nadequate office accommodation, administrative support, interpreters, and\ntransportation.\n11. The TA will be implemented over a period of eight months and will\nrequire 12 person-months of international and 14 person-months of domestic\nconsulting services. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The\nconsultants are expected to be fielded by August 1998 and their services completed in\nApril 1999. International and domestic consultants will be recruited in accordance with\nthe Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory\nto the Bank on the engagement of domestic consultants, using the Simplified Technical\nProposal procedures. The consultants will provide expertise in the fields of\nconstruction, construction training, jurisprudence and legislation, and computer systems\nand data processing.\n12. Office equipment and computer equipment for the national register of\ncontractors will be provided under the TA and will be procured in accordance with\nprocedures acceptable to the Bank. The computer equipment for the national register\nof contractors will include hardware and software for the initial operation of the system\nin the headquarters of MOon. The system wiU be designed for future connection to a\nwide area network that will facilitate the input and retrieval of information by other\nministries and provincial offices.\n13. A tripartite meeting will be held between the Government, the Bank, and\nthe consultants to discuss the interim report submitted by the consultants describing the\ndraft legislation for improvement of the policies and regulatory framework for the\nconstruction industry, and the recommendations for computer hardware and software\nfor the database and information system for the national register of consultants. A\nfurther tripartite meeting will be held to discuss the draft final report.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n14. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of\nthe People's Republic of China in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $570,000\nfor the purpose of Policies and Regulatory Framework for the Construction Industry,\nand hereby reports such action to the Board.\n\u2022- -\t. -- .-  . --  --\t\t --\t,-.\t . -A --\t.- - ._\u2022\t .\t _..\t - .\t \u2022r.\tnr\u2022,4r\t u Ip\u2022l_ r-,  _A. p \tFir (P,A\t \t ...\t (..1 J iI J 4IUI J\t I\t I'Jb4I r\nj\t j.y,.\t .\u2014 .\nI r , rc\t I r e, AII I F\t TrI\t I - r\t 1rrI\t I fl\t Ii\t -.t\t I r'i'i' ' ii\nIIIji\t 'iit\t i-i'-i'\t .-iiti\t iiit-i .-ii\n\u20221\t\nI\t UIIJ?LLiUL,dL)IIIIIJLlLIY ,-\t -\t -:-\nLII\t V\t L) I\t ,\t I\t Li L..I LI I I L li I\t 1111 I\t I I I 'I I C I...LJ I III I I\t LA I L.\t I I LI 1.1\t I \u00bc'!\t Li cI I!\\ L\u00bc' \u00bc'\t LI I\nr,'h i'.,i\t i\"i' 1 I-\t -.1 1!j 1I I'i1I II 1 I\t I\t I I I I1 11\t I'.

During the March 1998 Country Programming Mission, the Government\nof the People's Republic of China (PRC) reconfirmed its request for Bank technical\nassistance (TA) for policies and a regulatory framework for the construction industry. A\nFact-finding Mission visited the PRC from 9 to 2 March 1998 and reached an\nunderstanding with the Government regarding the objectives, scope, costs, terms of\nreference, and implementation arrangements for the TA. This Report is based on these\nunderstandings and the Mission's observations 1\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Since the adoption of economic reform measures in 1978, the\nconstruction industry in the PRC has grown rapidly to become the third pillar in the\nnational economy after manufacturing and agriculture. The value added in the\nconstruction industry is forecast to reach $120 billion by 2010, which will account for 6\npercent of the gross domestic product. The annual turnover for international projects\nand labor service is expected to reach $10 billion.\n3. While experiencing rapid growth, the construction industry has not\ndeveloped sufficiently in terms of productivity and quality of work. At present there are\nover 71,230 registered construction enterprises n the PRC of which 2,380 are\nregistered in the highest grade. This represents only 3.3 percent of the total, which is\nsmall by international comparison\n4 The problems encountered by the construction industry include (i)\ncontractors tending to be too specialized and not able to offer a diverse range of\nservices, (ii) the quality of bidding is not up to international standards, (iii) estimates are\nbased on Government regulations and pricing structures, rather than market prices and\nactual site conditions, and (iv) the number of experienced managerial and technical\npersonnel is insufficient to meet the demands of the ndustry.\n5. Despite the growth of the construction industry, it has failed to reach\ninternational standards in terms of bid preparation and contract execution. The industry\nis deficient in terms of pricing structure, work methods, scheduhng, resourcing, and\nconstruction management. This results in delays in project implementation, cost\noverruns, and poor quality control. While such deficiencies exist in the industry in the\nPRO, these have not been insurmountable because of assistance provided by local\ngovernment authorities and executing agencies, which has generally resulted in\nsuccessful project implementation. However, internationally, many contracts have\nexperienced inordinate delays in mobilization and project implementation. In some\ncases it has led to the termination of the contract The overall result has been that\nmany employers would like to avoid entering into contracts with contractors from the\nPRO.\n6. Against this background, the Government has requested the Bank to\nprovide TA to strengthen the governance system and provide capacity building for the\nconstruction industry. Such assistance will enable the construction industry to meet the\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities ir March 199T\n-\t -\t - _-\t --\t -\n-\n- .\t -\t -\t - -\n-\t -\t -\t -\n-\t -\t\n-\t -\t -\n-\t -\t -\t -\n-\n!rt \u2022\t f\u2022JI..1I\u2022A\t JA.AL 1VJL\n- - - -\t - - - -\t -- - - \n_i__-\t- \t - -\n-\t -\t - -\t - -\t -\t - -\t -\t .\t -\n._,l_._____._,__ -- - - -\t - -\t -\t - - . - - - - - - -\n_p\t\n- -", "requirements of market-based economies by improving the Government's regulatory\ncontrol of the industry and improving the management skills, competitiveness, and\nbusiness practices of the industry.\nIII.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n7. The objective of the TA is to strengthen the governance system and provide\ncapacity building for the construction industry to enhance its performance both within the\nPRO and internationally. The TA framework is in Appendix 1\nB.\t Scope\n8. Under the TA, an international firm of consultants will examine and\nreview the present policies and the regulatory framework, and develop proposals to\nmeet the objectives of the TA. The consultants will assist the Government in\nstrengthening the national register of contractors using a computerized database.\nContractors will be further classified according to their ability to execute contracts both\nwithin the PRO and internationally, based on experience, past performance, financial\ncapacity, and management and technical capability. To assist in the capacity building of\nthe construction industry, the TA will include a pilot training program for contractors on\nestimating prices, international bidding procedures, construction management, and\ninternationally accepted construction practices.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n9. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $785,000 equivalent, comprising\n$450,000 in foreign exchange and $335,000 equivalent in local currency. The Bank will\nprovide $570,000 equivalent to finance, on a grant basis from the Bank-funded TA\nprogram, the entire foreign exchange cost of $450,000 and $120,000 equivalent of the\nlocal currency cost. The foreign exchange will finance the remuneration, international\nand domestic travel, per diem, and out-of-pocket expenses of the international\nconsultants; computer hardware and software; office equipment; reports and training\ncourse material; communications; miscellaneous administration and support costs for\nthe consultants; and the cost of any observers at the negotiation. The local currency\nexpenditures to be financed by the Bank include remuneration, travel, and per diem for\ndomestic consultants; reports and training course material; translation costs; and pilot\ntraining course workshops. The Government agreed to finance the remaining local\ncurrency cost of $215,000 equivalent in kind and serces The cost estimates and\nfinancing plan is in Appendix 2.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n10. The Ministry of Construction (MOon), the Executing Agency, will be\nresponsible for implementing the TA. To reflect the interest of other concerned\ngovernment agencies, a TA steering committee will be established to guide\nrnplementation of the TA with participation of senior representatives from the People's\nBank of China; the ministries of Communications, Railways, Foreign Trade and\n.\" \n-, -'\t I I II I\t -\t V >( I / _4 4\nI r\\r\t II' ,-' .. -' , I-\t IL I\t -\t .',!

A TA project director, to be\nnominated by MOon, will be (i) the party to whom all notices and communications will\nbe addressed, (ii) the liaison between the steering committee and other relevant\ngovernment agencies, and (iii) the liaison between the consultants and the Bank.\nMCon will assign adequate counterpart staff to work with the consultant team under the\nleadership of the Project director. In addition, MOon will make available existing data\nthat is relevant to the TA, and will provide the consultants, when in the PRO, with\nadequate office accommodation, administrative support, interpreters, and\ntransportation.\n11. The TA will be implemented over a period of eight months and will\nrequire 12 person-months of international and 14 person-months of domestic\nconsulting services. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The\nconsultants are expected to be fielded by August 1998 and their services completed in\nApril 1999. International and domestic consultants will be recruited in accordance with\nthe Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory\nto the Bank on the engagement of domestic consultants, using the Simplified Technical\nProposal procedures. The consultants will provide expertise in the fields of\nconstruction, construction training, jurisprudence and legislation, and computer systems\nand data processing.\n12. Office equipment and computer equipment for the national register of\ncontractors will be provided under the TA and will be procured in accordance with\nprocedures acceptable to the Bank. The computer equipment for the national register\nof contractors will include hardware and software for the initial operation of the system\nin the headquarters of MOon. The system wiU be designed for future connection to a\nwide area network that will facilitate the input and retrieval of information by other\nministries and provincial offices.\n13. A tripartite meeting will be held between the Government, the Bank, and\nthe consultants to discuss the interim report submitted by the consultants describing the\ndraft legislation for improvement of the policies and regulatory framework for the\nconstruction industry, and the recommendations for computer hardware and software\nfor the database and information system for the national register of consultants. A\nfurther tripartite meeting will be held to discuss the draft final report.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n14. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of\nthe People's Republic of China in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $570,000\nfor the purpose of Policies and Regulatory Framework for the Construction Industry,\nand hereby reports such action to the Board.\n\u2022- -\t. -- .-  . --  --\t\t --\t,-.\t . -A --\t.- - ._\u2022\t .\t _..\t - .\t \u2022r.\tnr\u2022,4r\t u Ip\u2022l_ r-,  _A. p \tFir (P,A\t \t ...\t (..1 J iI J 4IUI J\t I\t I'Jb4I r\nj\t j.y,.\t .\u2014 .\nI r , rc\t I r e, AII I F\t TrI\t I - r\t 1rrI\t I fl\t Ii\t -.t\t I r'i'i' ' ii\nIIIji\t 'iit\t i-i'-i'\t .-iiti\t iiit-i .-ii\n\u20221\t\nI\t UIIJ?LLiUL,dL)IIIIIJLlLIY ,-\t -\t -:-\nLII\t V\t L) I\t ,\t I\t Li L..I LI I I L li I\t 1111 I\t I I I 'I I C I...LJ I III I I\t LA I L.\t I I LI 1.1\t I \u00bc'!\t Li cI I!\\ L\u00bc' \u00bc'\t LI I\nr,'h i'.,i\t i\"i' 1 I-\t -.1 1!j 1I I'i1I II 1 I\t I\t I I I I1 11\t I'.
