INTRODUCTION \n1.  Following a request from the Government of Bangladesh, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  included  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  in  the  country  partnership \nstrategy midterm review, 2006\u20132010 for Bangladesh to support climate change mitigation and \nrenewable energy development.1 During the consultation mission in November 2010, ADB, the \nMinistry of Environment and Forests, and the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources \n(MPEMR) discussed the capacity development needs and identified broad areas of possible \nintervention.  \n \n2.  The concept paper was approved on 22 March 2011 and a TA fact-finding mission was \nfielded 3\u20136 April 2011 to design the content and implementation arrangements of the TA. In a \nletter dated 21 April 2011, the Ministry of Finance confirmed the aide-m\u00e9moire containing the \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, terms of \nreference of consultants, and design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Given  its  geophysical  location,  low  deltaic  flood  plain,  and  erratic  monsoon  rainfall \nBangladesh  is  vulnerable  to  the  impact  of  climate  change.  Since  1990,  the  country  has \nexperienced a rise in sea level, intensified precipitation, and runoff variability\u2014causing massive \nfloods in the rainy season and severe drought in the dry season. Further, the country\u2019s large \npopulation with low gross domestic product per capita ($641 in 2010) makes Bangladesh\u2019s \neconomy highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. \n \n4.  As of 2005, the energy sector was the largest contributor of carbon dioxide emissions at \n36,071 gigagrams or 56% of the total. As projected by the Asia Least-Cost Greenhouse Gas \nAbatement Strategy study3 using 1990 as the base year, the energy sector\u2019s greenhouse gas \nemissions will increase sevenfold and its percentage contribution to total emissions will increase \nover time up to 2020. This trend implies that the impact of climate change caused by the energy \nsector will intensify. \n \n5.  Meanwhile, only about 47% of the population had access to electricity in 2009, and the \nenergy shortage has become the most critical infrastructure constraint to economic growth. In \n2010, the maximum demand for electricity is about 6,454 megawatts (MW) and it is expected to \nrise to 8,349 MW in 2013. However, the maximum available generation is 4,162 MW (of an \ninstalled capacity of 6,208 MW)\u20143,170 MW from natural gas and 165 MW from hydropower\u2014\nleaving a significant supply gap. The main causes for the supply shortage, among others, are \n(i) poor  operational  efficiency  of  thermal  power  plants  and  inefficient  use  of  energy; \n(ii) inadequate  supply  of  natural  gas,  which  forms  the  main  source  of  primary  energy  for \nelectricity generation (80% of generation capacity is based on natural gas); and (iii) lack of \ndiversification in energy supply, including inadequate exploitation of renewable energy. As a \nresult,  the  country  is  experiencing  long  hours  of  power  interruptions  causing  significant \neconomic losses. Many industrial and commercial establishments depend on expensive and \ninefficient captive generation during power interruptions. Therefore, Bangladesh faces the uphill \ntask of improving access to electricity and removing power-related constraints for economic \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009.

To address the power supply shortage problem as well as to abate greenhouse gas \nemission,  the  National  Energy  Policy,  2004  is  focusing on  (i)  providing  a sustainable  and \nbalanced energy supply, (ii) promoting rational use of energy, (iii) improving sector management \nand performance, and (iv) increasing private sector participation and investment. Further, the \ngovernment enacted the Renewable Energy Policy of Bangladesh in 2008. Accordingly, the \nSustainable Energy Development Authority (SEDA), is being established as a focal point for \nsustainable  energy  development  and  promotion,  with  support  from  German  development \ncooperation through GIZ and the World Bank. Through the Sustainable Energy for Development \nProject, GIZ is supporting the preparation of a SEDA act as well as its organizational formation \nand management mechanism. The World Bank, through its umbrella TA support for Power \nSector Development, is assisting the development of SEDA\u2019s strategy.  \n \n7.  In Strategy 2020,4 ADB has identified energy as a core operational sector, and achieving \nenvironmental  sustainability  as  a  strategic  priority  in  helping  developing  member  countries \nreduce poverty and improve living conditions and quality of life. ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy in \nBangladesh  also  emphasizes  promoting  an  enabling  business  environment  and  increased \ninvestment in clean energy such as wind and solar power, demonstrating a strong and clear \nconsistency between the strategic priorities of ADB and Bangladesh in the energy sector.  \n \n8.  The TA activities are consistent with the government\u2019s energy policy and ADB\u2019s energy \nsector strategy in Bangladesh. Taking into account ADB\u2019s former intervention and other donors\u2019 \ncontribution, the TA will provide key enabling conditions for the effective promotion of renewable \nenergy development in Bangladesh. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be the established capability of SEDA in the effective promotion of \nrenewable energy development. The outcome will be SEDA\u2019s readiness and capacity to fulfill its \nmandates. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The outputs will be (i) a renewable energy development road map, (ii) wind potential \nmapping in the selected coastal area, (iii) identification of one concentrated solar power project \nand one wind power plant project, and (iv) training and capacity building support to SEDA on the \nClean Development Mechanism. \n \n11.  Close coordination will be maintained with stakeholders such as the executing agency, \nother government agencies, and donors during implementation to ensure that the TA takes into \nconsideration existing studies, government priorities, strategies, polices, regulations, plans and \nresults of projects. Consultants will be required to examine international best practices to be \nused in delivering the TA outputs, and to maintain close working relations with the executing \nagency and ADB. Tripartite meetings among the executing agency, ADB, and the consultants \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2008.
