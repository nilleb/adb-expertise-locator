The Government of Viet Nam has requested advisory technical assistance (TA) from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for Supporting Financial Management Decentralization.1 The \nFact-Finding  Mission, 2 conducted  in  October  2007,  reached  an  understanding  with  the \nGovernment on the objectives, scope, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms \nof  reference  of  the  consultants  for  the  TA.  The  TA  will  focus  on  supporting  financial \ndecentralization and improving local authorities\u2019 financial management of projects financed by \nofficial  development  assistance  (ODA).  The  TA  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  2007\u20132010  country \nstrategy and program for Viet Nam as a firm 2007 TA, and is based on the paper\u2019s governance \nstrategy  including  support  to  decentralization  issues  and  operational  priority  to  facilitate \nimproved portfolio performance.3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Over the past decade Viet Nam has steadily strengthened the framework and institutions \nfor budget planning and execution. The new legal framework for public financial management is \nprovided in the 2002 State Budget Law. It introduced several reforms such as clarifying powers \nand responsibilities, enhancing decentralization, and promoting transparency and accountability \nin public finance. The law also grants more authority to subnational governments for budget \nplanning and management. The provincial people\u2019s councils took over real powers in the budget \napproval  process.  From  1992  to  2002,  the  share  of  subnational  governments  in  total \nexpenditure increased from 26% to 48%. The increased responsibilities and power for local \ngovernments created an urgent need to enhance the capacity of local institutions such as \ndepartments of finance, planning and investment, and treasury in public financial management.  \n \n3.  Investment financed by the national budget has grown rapidly and is now about 40% of \nthe  total  investment  in  the  country.  ODA  continues  to  play  an  important  role  in  public \ninvestment.  By  2006,  five  leading  development  partners:  ADB,  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, KfW Entwicklungsbank, and World \nBank (i.e., the Five Banks) committed $19 billion to support Viet Nam\u2019s development needs. The \nGovernment\u2019s new Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 calls for a large increase in \ninvestment, particularly for infrastructure development. To achieve the plan\u2019s goals to attain an \naverage annual economic growth rate of 7.5%\u20138%, the total investment required is estimated at \n$140\u2013$160 billion. To achieve this, $11 billion of ODA will need to be disbursed during 2006\u2013\n2010.  However,  disbursement  of  ODA  funds  is  slow  due  to  project  start-up  delay,  slow \nrecruitment of consultants, and prolonged procurement. Limited financial management capacity \nat various levels continues to be cited as a factor that impedes project implementation and \nmanagement.  \n \n4.  With  growing  infrastructure  needs  and  a  greater  role  for  provincial  authorities  in \neconomic development, provincial and municipal authorities tend to borrow directly from the \ndomestic capital market and development agencies to finance their capital expenditure needs. \nFor  example,  ADB,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  and  World  Bank  are  now \nprocessing projects directly for Ho Chi Minh City. ADB has a number of pipeline projects to be \nimplemented by the people\u2019s committees of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, for which direct \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 7 December 2007 \n2  The Fact-Finding Mission comprised Bui Trong Nghia, Financial Sector Officer, Viet Nam Resident Mission and \nOmkar Shrestha, Principal Program Economist, Viet Nam Resident Mission. \n3  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2007\u20132010): Viet Nam. Manila ", "2 \nlending is likely to be adopted. However the procedures and capacity of the local departments of \nfinance in managing fund borrowing and repayment have not been comprehensively assessed. \nThe recent update of Public Financial Management Accountability4 noted limited capacity of the \nlocal finance departments. Improved institutional arrangements, policy, and capacity for fund \nmanagement are critically needed for local authorities to undertake borrowing. \n \n5.  The Government\u2019s commitment to continued improvement of the legal and institutional \nframework for ODA management is an important factor for effective mobilization and utilization \nof ODA funds. Several decrees and regulations have been issued and revised. In 2006, the \nGovernment issued Decree 131/2006/ND/CP on ODA Management and Utilization. It facilitates \ngreater decentralization of project management by allowing line ministries and/or provinces to \nappraise  and  approve  ODA  projects.  This  delegation  is  consistent  with  the  overall \ndecentralization strategy of the Government with regard to investment from domestic resources. \nThis change is expected to reduce the time required for investment decisions and accelerate the \nimplementation of ODA programs and projects. One of the important reforms under Decree 131 \nis the emphasis on transparency and dissemination of information related to ODA priorities, \npolicies,  and  procedures.  The  decree  introduces  a  clearer  system  for  monitoring  project \nperformance. Despite these changes, impediments have been encountered in implementing \ndecentralized projects. Review and approval of the work plan, procurement, financial plan, and \nbudget changes have to go through different levels of authorities; this exerts an unnecessary \nadministrative burden on the project management units and delays project implementation. \nManagement procedures for decentralized projects need to be streamlined. \n \n6.  Decree  131/2006/ND-CP  stipulates  that  ODA  programs  and  projects  should  be \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  the  related  legal  documents  for  domestic  programs  and \nprojects in terms of appraisal and approval, procurement, settlement and site clearance, taxes, \netc. In accordance with the Hanoi Core Statement on Aid Effectiveness, this provides a good \nopportunity for aligning funding agency procedures with the Government system, as it is being \nstrengthened to reflect international standards and practices.  \n \n7.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) issued implementing guidelines on financial management \nof ODA projects under Decree 131, specifying procedures for financial planning and approval of \nthe financial plan, disbursement of ODA funds, and control of expenditures. The implementing \nguidelines are cross-referenced to other legal documents governing different aspects of public \nfinancial management such as those on accounting, auditing, taxation, and preparation of final \naccounts.  Training  of  staff\u2014local  staff  in  particular\u2014is  needed  on  the  new  policies  and \nprocedures for financial management of ODA projects. The 2007 Joint Portfolio Performance \nReview conducted by the Government\u2019s Inter-Ministerial Task Force on ODA and the Five \nBanks (para. 3) suggests that as more power and authority are delegated to line ministries and \nlocal  authorities,  the  need  to  enhance  their  capacity  to  effectively  assume  the  increased \nresponsibilities  will  become  critical.  The  TA  for  enhancing  ODA  absorptive  capacity  and \nefficiency approved in October 2007 was designed to help the Government implement the \nspecific actions recommended by this review that are expected to improve performance of the \nODA portfolio.5  \n \n                                                \n4  Ministry of Finance, Government of Viet Nam, and World Bank. 2005.

Manila. \n ", "3 \n8.  The 2007\u20132010 country strategy and program considers improved governance, greater \nefforts to control corruption, and ADB assistance to these areas as key for ADB inventions in \nViet Nam over the next 3 years (footnote 3). It states that with 40% of gross domestic product to \nbe devoted to investment each year (as envisaged in the Socio-Economic Development Plan), \nmobilizing such a huge amount of resources in a transparent and efficient way will be an \ninstitutional  challenge.  The  public  sector\u2019s  capacity  to  rigorously  appraise  and  effectively \nmanage  its  investments  is  still  limited.  The  governance  assessment  (footnote  3)  identifies \nimprovement of public expenditure management and enhancement of the capacity of local \ngovernments  to  plan  and  manage  the  budget  including  their  revenues,  expenditures,  and \nborrowing, as key areas requiring support. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA will assist the Government in strengthening utilization of ODA funds to support \neconomic and social development needs. The expected outcome will be improved financial \nmanagement and performance of ODA projects under the Government\u2019s decentralization policy. \nTo achieve this outcome, the TA activities will support (i) improvement of the legal framework \nand  procedures  for  financial  management  decentralization,  (ii)  improvement  of  capacity \nespecially  of  local  authorities  in  financial  management  of  decentralized  ODA  projects,  (iii) \nstrengthening of local government systems and capacity for managing borrowed funds, and (iv) \nenhancement  of  mobilization  and  utilization  of  less-concessional  funds6 from  development \nagencies and other sources in support of the growing public investment programs. \n \n10.   The TA will be complementary to United Nations Development Programme assistance \nfor public debt management and World Bank assistance for public expenditure review. The \nproposed  TA,  focusing  on  strengthening  of  local  authorities\u2019  capacity  for  managing  funds \nborrowed under ODA projects and programs, will also complement the TA for enhancing ODA \nabsorptive capacity and efficiency that aims to help the central government agencies improve \nefficiency  in  preparation  and  implementation  of  ODA  projects  and  programs.  It could  help \nprepare for possible broader ADB support programs to strengthen public financial management \nand decentralization as ADB has done in other countries in the region such as Indonesia and \nthe Philippines.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The  TA  will  help  the  Government  (i)  conduct  an  in-depth  review  and  analysis  of \nconstraints  in  the  regulations,  procedures,  and  capacity  for  financial  management \ndecentralization, and in the systems and capacity for managing borrowed funds; (ii) identify \nresponsibilities of the parties involved in the financial management of decentralized projects; \nand (iii) define steps, measures, and time frame to improve the current regulation and system; \nand rationalize the responsibilities of relevant agencies. ADB will coordinate and synchronize \nthe implementation of the proposed TA and TA for enhancing ODA absorptive capacity and \nefficiency to ensure that capacity building for the central government agencies and the local \nauthorities will be consistent and complementary. The TA will undertake a series of workshops \nand seminars to disseminate the TA findings to relevant stakeholders and to achieve consensus \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                \n6  In order to respond to the huge development needs of Viet Nam, development agencies are introducing less-\nconcessional funds, i.e., ordinary capital resources for ADB and International Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment products for World Bank. \n ", "4 \non recommended measures and actions. Capacity building will be an important component. \nTraining  programs  will  be  conducted  for  officials  of  MOF,  relevant  ministries,  and  local \nauthorities in project financial management with a focus on decentralized projects. A summary \nof the four key activities of the TA follows. \n \n12.  Assess and Improve Policies, Procedures, and Systems Related to Local Financial \nManagement. The TA will support the review of current policy and procedures for local project \nfinancial management. This will include budget planning, expenditure control, processing of \nchanges in financial allocations during project implementation, and preparation of final accounts. \nAs more projects are delegated to local authorities, the existing regulations on local financial \nmanagement may constraint efforts in project implementation. The TA will recommend ways to \nimprove the current regulations and procedures. In addition, the TA will examine the institutional \nframework and capacity of local departments of finance to manage debt as selected municipal \ngovernments are allowed to borrow directly from development agencies and are accountable for \nthe  repayment.  A  report  will  be  prepared  with  recommendations  to  improve  the  operating \nsystems and staff capacity of local authorities in managing the borrowed funds, including proper \nrecording and accounting, management of associated risks, and planning for repayments in the \nbudgeting  process.  Consultation  workshops  will  be  organized  to  discuss  the  issues  and \nsuggestions in the reports. The TA will also support incorporating the recommendations in the \nrevision of relevant regulations if required.  \n \n13.  Train and Build Capacity of Line Ministries and Local Governments in Project \nFinancial  Management.  The  Government  has  issued  Decree  131/2006/ND-CP  on  ODA \nManagement and Utilization as well as the implementing guidelines on financial management of \nODA projects. Such regulations allow greater delegation of authority in ODA project preparation \nand management with a view to facilitating project implementation and ODA fund disbursement. \nThe guidelines on financial management cover areas such as budget planning, disbursement of \nfunds, and project accounting. The TA will support the training of staff of MOF, line ministries, \nlocal departments of finance, and project management units on policies and skills for project \nfinancial management, especially for decentralized projects. The training courses will cover \nfinancial  planning,  disbursement,  project  accounting  and  auditing,  preparation  of  the  final \naccount, project asset management, and taxation issues. MOF will consult with line ministries \nand local authorities to define the training needs. Local staff will be the target participants of \nsuch training courses. Resource speakers/trainers will be engaged to conduct the training. The \ntrainers could be experienced staff of the State Treasury, Academy of Finance, Accounting \nAssociation or Accounting Policy Department, and MOF\u2019s State Budget Department. \n \n14.  Improve Mobilization and Utilization of Less-Concessional Funding Sources. With \nrapid  economic  growth,  the  financial  need  of  the  Government  to  develop  infrastructure  is \nsignificantly increasing. In addition to traditional concessional ODA resources, the Government \nis tapping less-concessional funding sources from development agencies. The Government \nadopted the principle that commercial loans and less-concessional loans should only be used \nfor  revenue  generating  sectors  and  projects.  MOF  was  assigned  to  study  and  prepare \nguidelines for mobilizing and utilizing less-concessional funding sources, taking into account \ndebt service sustainability and investment needs. The TA will support MOF to prepare such a \nreport. A study visit will be organized for MOF officials to study the experience of relevant \ncountries in local financial management and utilization of less-concessional funding sources. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n ", "5 \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000. ADB will finance the equivalent of \n$400,000 on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will provide \n$100,000 equivalent, mainly in kind, covering remuneration of counterpart staff, provision of \noffice accommodation, administrative and logistic support, and local travel. The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  MOF will be the Executing Agency. A vice minister of MOF will be the TA director, \nproviding overall guidance for implementation. MOF will assign the director of the External \nFinance Department as the deputy director of the TA. The External Finance Department will act \nas the focal point for coordinating TA activities. A working group will be established to work with \nthe TA consultants to implement the TA. The group will comprise officials from the External \nFinance  Department,  State  Budget  Department,  Treasury  Department,  Accounting  Policy \nDepartment,  General  Department  of  Taxation,  Asset  Management  Department,  Investment \nDepartment, Administrative Financial Management Department, and selected local departments \nof finance. To facilitate smooth TA implementation, the working group will meet on a quarterly \nbasis or as required to monitor TA implementation progress and ensure the TA objectives are \nachieved. ADB will be invited to the meetings. The TA will be implemented over 24 months, \nfrom March 2008 to March 2010. \n \n17.  The international public financial management specialist (4 person-months) will act as \nthe TA team  leader. The  consultant  will  support  MOF  and  local  authorities to  review  and \nimprove  their  system  and  capacity  to  manage  their  foreign  borrowing.  An  international \neconomist will be engaged for 3 person-months to help MOF prepare guidelines for mobilizing \nless-concessional funds to support the country\u2019s growing infrastructure needs. Two national \nconsultants will be recruited to undertake the tasks defined in the terms of reference and \nsupport the international consultants and MOF for a total of 15 person-months. The outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be recruited on an \nindividual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). Several workshops and training courses will be organized to discuss the TA \nfindings and to train staff involved in the financial management of ODA projects. A study visit will \nbe organized for the staff of MOF and relevant ministries to study the experience of a relevant \ncountry  in  managing  and  utilizing  less-concessional funding  sources. The  team  leader  will \nadvise MOF on the selection of the country for the study visit. Procurement of equipment for the \nTA will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The equipment will be transferred to MOF upon TA completion. \n \n18.  The consultants will prepare and submit the following reports and documents to MOF (in \nEnglish and Vietnamese) and ADB (in English): (i) an inception report after 1 month of fieldwork; \n(ii) interim progress reports; and (iii) draft and final completion reports upon completion of the \nTA, covering implementation and impact of TA activities. ADB will conduct inception or review \nmissions  during  each  phase  of the TA  and  participate  in tripartite meetings  (Government, \nconsultants, ADB) to review TA progress.  \n \nIV.
