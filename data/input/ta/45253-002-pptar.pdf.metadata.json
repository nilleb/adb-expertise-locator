The PPTA is necessary to effectively formulate the CMDP III which will support the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to meaningful capital market reform. \n \nB.  Objective \n2.  The objective of the PPTA is to identify policy measures to support the development of a \nrobust financial markets system in Bangladesh that is well balanced, sustainable and resilient \nand that is able to effectively intermediate savings to finance investment.    \n \nC.  Major Outputs and Activities \n3.  The PPTA will build upon the reforms being undertaken in the ongoing CMDP II. For \ndeveloping the bond markets, the PPTA experts will also draw upon the results of the work \ncurrently being undertaken to assess Bangladesh\u2019s primary dealer system by experts engaged \nunder ADB\u2019s ongoing Bangladesh Bank capacity development TA. The implications of shadow \nbanking  on  Bangladesh\u2019s  capital  markets  will  also  be  examined.  The  PPTA  will  engage \ninternational and domestic consultants who will  work closely with the Government, market \nparticipants, and ADB in the five areas below. \n \n(i)  Improved legal and regulatory structure. Building upon reforms undertaken in \nCMDP II, the first output will assist the Government in further developing the \nlegal and financial supervisory policy structure that strikes the right balance in \nfinancial  regulation  and  enhances  the  stability  of  the  Bangladesh  financial \nsystem.  The  PPTA  will  assist  in  developing  measures  to  remove  inherent \nconflicts  of  interest,  eliminate  opportunities  for  arbitrage  between  the  stock \nexchanges,  and  enhance  liquidity  and  public  trust.  The  PPTA  will  focus  on \noptions for legal and regulatory reforms as well as benchmarking regulatory \nefforts against international standards. Structural and institutional issues such as \nlimited IDRA autonomy will be analyzed and measures will be recommended to \nalleviate such issues. The promotion and participation of private equity finance \nand  Islamic  finance  (such  as  sukuks)  in  capital  markets  through  legal  and \nregulatory reforms will also be considered.  \n \n(ii)  Bond  market  development  and  deepening  the  scope  of  securitization. \nBuilding upon the fundamentals of bond market development in CMDP II, the \nsecond output will focus on measures that will lead to the extension of the \ngovernment  yield  curve  and  therefore  further  corporate  bond  market \ndevelopment. The PPTA will analyze impediments to the development of a liquid \ndebt market and recommend a debt market strategy that will foster a deep, liquid, \nand transparent debt market offering a wide range of products. On the supply \nside, emphasis will be placed on increasing the supply of high-quality corporate \npaper  building  on  the  benchmark  yield  curve  of  Government  of  Bangladesh \ntradable securities and thereby improving the functioning and efficiency of the \nfixed-income  market.  This  output  will  also  focus  on  developing  competitive \npricing of primary issuances including promoting the role of credit rating agencies \nand the use of credit enhancement products or risk mitigation instruments. On \nthe demand side, initiatives to increase the demand for corporate securities will \n ", "Appendix 4  11 \n \nbe  assessed  including  through  contractual  savings  institutions  (such  as \npromoting  the  establishment  of  pension  and  provident  fund  management \ncompanies  and  enhancing  their  participation  in  capital  markets).  Regional \nexperiences in developing resilient, liquid bond markets will be considered while \nformulating the strategy. The role of mutual funds in promoting capital market \ndevelopment and bond market development will also be further explored. As a \nlogical  sequence  of  this  output,  efforts  will  also  focus  on  developing  the \nsecuritization market.  \n \n(iii)  Development  of  successful  financial-instrument  tax  policies.  The  third \noutput  will  involve  a  systematic  analysis  of  the  tax  structure  of  financial \ninstruments based on amendments to the tax ordinance under CMDP II. It will \nrecommend measures that are compatible with financial market development\u2014\nand  that  also  do  not  violate  tax  principles\u2014to  remove  distortions  between \ndifferent types of financial assets. The potential impacts of a tax-neutral structure \nwill be assessed and the likely benefits of such a structure will be weighed \nagainst the likely costs. This will be substantiated by an analysis of successful \nfinancial-instrument tax policies elsewhere in the region. A sequenced action \nplan will be developed that is compatible with financial market development.  \n \n(iv)  Development  of  derivatives.  This  output  will  focus  on  establishing  a \ncommodities exchange (including its regulatory framework) and developing key \nfundamentals of the derivative industry\u2014particularly interest rate derivatives and \nexchange  rate  derivatives.  The  fourth  output  will  help  determine  the  capital \nadequacy,  position  limits,  margin  requirements,  and  sales  practices  to  be \nadopted by dealers for derivatives. This output will also ensure that the structure \nof regulation and risk management in the derivatives market meets the market \nrequirement.  \n \n(v)  Development of insurance sector. Building upon the insurance white paper \nroadmap  developed  under  CMDP  II  and  insurance  regulations  issued  under \nCMDP II, the fifth output will focus on measures to strengthen the insurance \nsector  such  as  recapitalization  of  the  insurance  companies  which  will  be \nsequenced  with  actions  to  ensure  active  investment  and  participation  of the \ninsurance sector in the capital markets. The output will also consider steps on \nhow to strengthen the qualifications of insurance professionals such as through \nestablishing a Charter Insurance Institute.  \n \n4.
