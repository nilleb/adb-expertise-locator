INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  implementation  of  the  Pacific \nRegion  Infrastructure  Facility  (PRIF)  through  development  and  operation  of  the  PRIF \nCoordination  Office  for  3  years.  The  PRIF  is  a  multipartner  investment  coordination  and \ntechnical facility, which supports infrastructure development and maintenance in the Pacific. The \nTA design is based on extensive consultation with PRIF partners.1 The project design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Extensive analysis of development issues confronting Pacific  island countries3 have \nidentified the following key drivers of change: (i) an improved private sector environment, (ii) \nimproved public sector management, (iii) capacity development, (iv) climate change adaptation \nand mitigation, (v) development partnerships, and (vi) gender mainstreaming.4 In particular, \ninstitutional weakness and limited capacity were identified as major constraints on infrastructure \ndevelopment and maintenance in the Pacific. The Pacific Approach (footnote 4) notes that the \nregion suffers from infrastructure projects planned and financed without adequate institutional \nand human capacity development efforts which, when combined with a weak policy environment, \nresults in unsustainable infrastructure development. The analysis concludes that TA support for \ncapacity  development  and  policy  and  institutional  reforms  has  resulted  in  demonstrated \nimprovements  in  infrastructure  delivery,  and  calls  for  a  long-term  approach  to  capacity \ndevelopment by development partners.  \n \n3.  Core issues for delivery of infrastructure services in the Pacific include (i) loss of synergy \nthrough  operating  competitively  rather  than  collaboratively;  (ii)  institutional  structures \ninappropriate to sustaining quality service delivery; (iii) lack of regulatory capacity to protect the \npublic  interest  and  foster  greater  private  sector  participation;  (iv)  lack  of  appropriate  and \naffordable training; and (v) limited expertise at critical stages of sector reform such as legislative \ndrafting, policy formulation, financial and tariff modeling, and engineering inputs.5 These factors \ncontribute  to  a  lack  of  maintenance,  inappropriate  technology,  and  frequently  unaffordable \nsolutions to infrastructure needs. Development partners have often been part of the problem by \nimposing external priorities, overburdening fragile administrative and management systems, and \noperating competitively in their own interests rather than collaboratively in the partner country\u2019s \ninterest. \n \n4.  To address these issues, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has formed a partnership \nwith the Australian Agency for International Development, New Zealand Ministry of Foreign \nAffairs and Trade, the World Bank Group (including the International Finance Corporation), \nEuropean Commission, and European Investment Bank to create the PRIF. The purpose of the \nfacility  is  to  improve  development  effectiveness  and  the  sustainability  of  infrastructure \ninvestments by strengthening coordination among development partners; improving policies and \n                                                \n1  PRIF partners are Asian Development Bank, Australian Agency for International Development, New Zealand \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, World Bank Group (including the International Finance Corporation), \nEuropean Commission, and European Investment Bank. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website on 24 \nJanuary 2013.  \n3  PRIF covers 12 Pacific island countries: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, \nNauru, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.   \n4  ADB. 2009.

The PRIF initiative was officially launched in August 2008 at the Pacific Islands Forum. \nThe  facility  covers  12  Pacific  island  countries7 and  supports  five  economic  infrastructure \nsubsectors  (energy;  telecommunications;  road,  aviation,  and  maritime  transport;  waste \nmanagement; and water and sanitation). The work of the PRIF has been managed by (i) a \ndevelopment partner coordination function supervised by the PRIF Secretariat located within the \nWorld Bank Sydney office (two full-time consultants), and (ii) a technical assistance support \nfacility (Pacific Infrastructure Advisory Center [PIAC]8) located in the ADB Pacific Liaison and \nCoordination Office (PLCO) in Sydney (four full-time consultants). The initial phase of both \nthese functions commenced in August 2009 and is scheduled to end in April 2013. The PRIF\u2019s \nwork plan is guided by the interdevelopment-partner PRIF Management Committee (PMC)9 and \nsenior management team consisting of representatives from each PRIF partner.  \n \n6.  The PRIF initiative is a multipartner investment coordination and TA mechanism and is a \nsignificant joint commitment to improving infrastructure services in the region in accordance with \nthe  Paris  Declaration  on  Aid  Effectiveness  and  the  Cairns  Compact  on  Strengthening \nDevelopment Coordination. Since its launch, the PRIF has provided a successful mechanism for \ncoordinating  PRIF  partner  infrastructure  investment  and  providing  technical  assistance  to \nparticipating Pacific island countries. The PRIF provides a platform and dedicated resources to \nenable development partners to better coordinate and harmonize their support, and, in doing so, \nbetter address the economic infrastructure needs of Pacific island countries. This proposed TA \nwill consolidate the gains to date and provide ongoing resources to scale up the initiative. \n \n7.  Two independent reviews have provided guidance to the PMC and senior management \nteam on development of the PRIF.10 The reviews acknowledge the benefits provided through \nthe PRIF initiative of improved development partner coordination and TA.11 The Management \nand Governance Options Analysis (footnote 10) recommends that the current functions of the \nPIAC and the PRIF Secretariat should be continued, but should be brought together under a \nsingle PRIF coordination office. The analysis also indicated broad appreciation by Pacific island \ncountries for the activities of PIAC and the PRIF Secretariat and strong desire to continue the \nsupport provided.12 In response to the independent reviews, and as requested by the PRIF \npartners, ADB proposes to host the combined PRIF coordination office at the PLCO. This will \ncontinue to locate the PRIF initiative close to PRIF development partners. Locating the PRIF \n                                                \n6   The PRIF also engages and shares information on activities with other Pacific region organizations.  \n7   Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon   \n     Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.   \n8   ADB. 2008.

PIAC has provided a range of technical assistance including preparation of national \ninfrastructure investment plans for 6 Pacific island countries, Pacific utility benchmarking studies for power and \nwater sector, institutional support for over 10 power and power utilities, 3 scoping studies for maritime port \ninfrastructure, 5 analytical studies and development of Pacific infrastructure performance indicators.     \n12 PIAC is currently implementing approximately 25 technical assistance projects. However, PIAC receives 30-40 \nrequests for annum for technical assistance, demonstrating a high demand for assistance from the Pacific island \ncountries.   \n ", "  3 \ncoordination office in PLCO will also improve coordination with the Private Sector Development \nInitiative, which is also located at the PLCO. The proposed TA will support both the PRIF \npartner coordination function (currently implemented through the PRIF Secretariat) and the TA \nfunction (currently implemented through the PIAC). The independent reviews also provided \nrecommendations to improve PRIF design, which have been incorporated into the design of the \nconsolidated  PRIF  coordination  office,  including  (i)  establishing  lead  sector  coordinators, \nnominated by the PRIF partners, (ii) enhancing research agenda of infrastructure development \nin  the  Pacific,  (iii)  improving  communication  with  Pacific  island  countries  through  a  PRIF \ncommunications strategy, and (iv) enhancing PRIF partner harmonization.   \n \n8.  The proposed TA is included in the Pacific regional operations business plan, 2013\u2013\n2015  as  a  2013  nonlending  activity.13 The  proposed  TA  supports the plan\u2019s  emphasis  on \nstrengthening  core  government  functions,  including  policy  formulation  and  public  sector \nmanagement. The design of the proposed PRIF coordination office is based on the design of \nthe  existing  PRIF  Secretariat  and  PIAC,  however  the  design  also  incorporates  the \nrecommendations  of  independent  evaluations  (footnote  10)  and  direction  from  the  senior \nmanagement team. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be improved quality of infrastructure investments in the Pacific island \ncountries.  The  outcome  will  be  the  governments  of  the  Pacific  island  countries  receive \ncomprehensive and coordinated support and TA on infrastructure investments. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The proposed TA will support implementation of the PRIF through development and \noperation of the PRIF coordination office. The outputs of the project are as follows:  \n \n(i)  Improved  coordination  of  Pacific  Region  Infrastructure  Facility  partner \ninfrastructure investments in the Pacific. PRIF partner infrastructure investments \nwill be coordinated through the PRIF coordination office. The PRIF coordination \noffice will include six core consultants who will be responsible for facilitating PRIF \npartner  coordination  and  providing  short-term  TA  support  to  the  Pacific  island \ncountries and PRIF partners. The core team will be supported by individual short-\nterm consultants who will undertake targeted TA activities. The PRIF coordination \noffice  will  provide  support  to  five  economic  infrastructure  subsectors  (energy; \ntelecommunications; road,  aviation,  and maritime transport;  waste management; \nand  water  and  sanitation).  The  PRIF  coordination  office  operations  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with the PRIF operations manual, and activities will be \nimplemented as detailed in the annual PRIF work plan. Monitoring of results will be \nthrough  the  PRIF  results  framework,  which  will  include  the  project  design  and \nmonitoring framework. The PRIF coordination office will coordinate infrastructure \ndelivery by PRIF partners by  \n(a)  coordinating PMC and senior management team meetings,  \n(b)  implementing an approved program of research and analysis of infrastructure \nissues in the Pacific,  \n                                                \n13   ADB. 2012. Pacific: Regional Operations and Business Plan, 2013\u20132015. Manila.   \n ", "4   \n(c)  assisting lead sector coordinators in sector coordination activities,  \n(d)  maintaining the PRIF website containing publicly available information on \nPRIF partner activities,  \n(e)  facilitating interpartner technical review of infrastructure investment design \ndocuments,  \n(f)  implementing a PRIF communications strategy,  \n(g)  maintaining a PRIF partner activity database,  \n(h)  facilitating increased cofinancing activities, and  \n(i)  facilitating delivery of a PRIF harmonization agenda.   \n \n(ii)  Governments of the Pacific island countries and Pacific Region Infrastructure \nFacility  partners  receive  technical  advice  on  infrastructure  development. \nTechnical  advice  will  be  provided  by  the  PRIF  coordination  office,  including \ninfrastructure development plans (either national infrastructure plans or sector plans) \nand provide infrastructure policy, regulatory, and project implementation advice. The \nPRIF coordination office will also provide TA to the Pacific island countries as short-\nterm  inputs  (less  than  6  months  continuous)  of  technical  expertise  to  support \nimplementation  and  evaluation  of  infrastructure  investments  across  the  target \ninfrastructure  sectors,  including  both  public  and  private  sectors.  The  PRIF \ncoordination office will manage the quality assurance of TA support, as well as TA \nfor  knowledge  products  for  infrastructure  in  the  Pacific  in  accordance  with  an \napproved research program. \n \n11.  Major assumptions are that the Pacific island countries will continue to improve the \nquality  of their  public  expenditure, maintain  or  increase  budget allocation for  infrastructure \nmaintenance,  utilize  infrastructure  planning  documents,  and  continue  to  demand  external \nadvisory services. It is also assumed that PRIF partners will remain committed to increased \ncoordination and harmonization. Major risks are (i) limited capacity of government agencies in \nthe Pacific island countries to implement infrastructure plans, (ii) poor availability of data that \ncould reduce the quality of analyses, and (iii) that some PRIF partner business processes are \ndifficult to harmonize. The major risks will be managed by (i) ensuring infrastructure plans are \ndesigned considering capacity of the Pacific island country governments, and by undertaking \ncapacity development activities; (ii) supporting data collection activities by the PRIF coordination \noffice; and (iii) engaging in dialogue with PRIF partners regarding system harmonizing.      \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $11.8 million, of which $0.5 million (4.2%) will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V), and $11.3 million will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Government of Australia ($8.9 million equivalent, 75.5%) \nand the Government of New Zealand ($2.4 million equivalent, 20.3%). ADB will administer the \ngrants. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the executing agency of the TA. The TA will require a total of 318 person-\nmonths of international consultants and 168 person-months of national consultants to be hired \nthrough  individual  consultant  selection.14 Six  full-time  consultants  (three  international  [108 \n                                                \n14 The consultants will be recruited on an individual basis because (i) the three international specialists will fill \ncomplex and sensitive roles that require direct control over selection, (ii) there are only three international staff to \n ", "  5 \nperson-months] and three national [108 person-months]) will be recruited as the core team for \nthe PRIF coordination office for an initial 3-year period.15 The TA will be implemented between \nApril  2013  and  April  2016.  The  core  team  will  be  supported  by  specialized  short-term \nconsultants  (international  210  person-months  and  national  60  person-months)  who  will  be \nrecruited through a combination of individual consultant selection and indefinite delivery contract. \nThe specialized short-term consultants will also be required for specific on-demand assignments \nthat result from government or PRIF partner demand for support with analysis, advice, project \npreparation, implementation, and review in the focal sectors. Terms of reference for short-term \nassignments will be prepared by the PRIF coordination office core team and submitted for \nclearance by the PMC. Consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment and materials \nfinanced under the technical assistance will be procured by the PRIF coordination office core \nteam in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAt completion of the project, equipment and materials will either be transferred to subsequent \nphases of the PRIF or provided to participating Pacific island countries, as determined by the \nPMC. Training and workshops will be implemented through the consultants\u2019 contracts. The \nproceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n14.  Governments  of  the  Pacific  island  countries  will  provide  counterpart  support  and \nservices including counterpart staff, office space, furniture, administrative support costs, and \nlogistics costs. The PMC will approve the PRIF coordination office annual work plan and any \nproposed  variations  to  the  work  plan.  The  PRIF  coordination  office  will  prepare  quarterly \nprogress reports, which will outline activities undertaken and progress towards performance \nindicators. The PMC will approve the quarterly progress reports. Sector work undertaken by the \nPRIF coordination office will be guided by the  lead sector coordinators (representatives from \nthe PRIF partners) who will coordinate technical input from sector specialists within the PRIF \npartners. The outputs will be monitored through a PRIF results framework and disseminated \nthrough quarterly  newsletters  and  annual  reports.  The  PRIF  coordination  office  includes  a \nresults and research manager who will develop a communications strategy to disseminate \ninformation on PRIF coordination office activities. An independent review of PRIF coordination \noffice activities will be undertaken after the end of the second year of operation. No activities will \nbe undertaken in participating countries until no-objection letters have been obtained.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION  \n \n15.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $11.3 million for Establishment of the \nPacific Region Infrastructure Facility Coordination Office, to be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of Australia (A$8.5 million) and the Government of New Zealand (NZ$3.0 million). \nIf the Board approves ADB administering the technical assistance, the President, acting under \nthe authority delegated by the Board, approves ADB providing the balance of the technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $0.5 million on a grant basis, for Establishment of \nthe Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility Coordination Office.  \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \nbe recruited on a full-time basis, (iii) it is not cost-effective to recruit national administrative staff through a firm, and \n(iv) it is unlikely that any firm would have the range of expertise to provide the required international and national \nshort-term specialists in highly specialized areas. \n15 The 3-year term contracts for the six core PRIF coordination office staff will include annual performance reviews \nand options, at the discretion of ADB, for further contract extension for up to 2 years.   \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Baselinesa   Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nThe quality of  Increased infrastructure  PRIF quarterly reports  Governments of the \ninfrastructure  maintenance budgets to    Pacific island countries \ninvestments in the  minimum acceptable  maintain or increase \nPacific sector \nPacific island  service levels as defined  budget allocation for \nbenchmarking studies  \ncountriesb has  in PRIF baseline  infrastructure \n \nimproved  assessment for at least  maintenance  \none sector in six Pacific   \nisland countries by April  Governments of the \n2019  Pacific island countries \n  improve quality of public \n  expenditure \n \nRisk \nLimited capacity of \ngovernment agencies in \nthe Pacific island \ncountries to implement \ninfrastructure plans \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nGovernments of the  Number of joint  PRIF quarterly reports   Government agencies in \nPacific island  development partner  the Pacific island \nPacific sector \ncountries receive  project design and  countries utilize \nbenchmarking studies  \ncomprehensive and  review missions  infrastructure planning \ncoordinated support  increased to 20% by  Interview with the  documents \nand TA on  April 2016 compared to  Pacific island country \nPRIF partners allocate \ninfrastructure  June 2013 baseline  governments \nsufficient resources to \ninvestments   \nsupport PRIF coordination \n  66% (8 of 12) of the \noffice activities \n  Pacific island country \ngovernments receive \nPRIF technical support \nby April 2016, including 2 \nadditional countries \nwhich did not receive \nPIAC support (2011-\n2013).  \n \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
