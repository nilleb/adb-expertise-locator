The Project will organize\nfarmers to operate and maintain irrigation systems, and assist\nhouseholds to obtain land title.\nClassification Primary: economic\nSecondary: poverty reduction\nEnvironmental Category  -   B\nAssessment An initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken, and\nis summarized in an appendix.\nRationale The  Government  places  a  high  priority  on  poverty  reduction\nthrough growth of the rural economy. The Asian Development\nBank's (ADB) strategy in Cambodia supports this objective by\nfocusing investments in the populous rural areas of the plains\nand Tonle Sap region, where the majority of the poor reside.\nAgriculture, the mainstay of the rural economy, is hampered by\nlack of irrigation, poor roads and market facilities, and limited\naccess  to  improved  farming  technology.  The  project  area  in\nKompong Thom Province is dominated by rural subsistence or\nsemisubsistence farming  dependent  on  one  low-yield  rain-fed\nrice crop per year. The majority of households live below the\nCambodian poverty line. Periodic droughts in the wet season, or\nsevere flooding, force families into debt to meet their subsistence\nfood needs.  For  lack of  irrigation,  most  lands  lie barren  and\nfallow in the dry season.\nThe provision of irrigation and drainage, agriculture extension,\nrural  roads,  and  markets  can  have  an  important  impact  on\nagricultural productivity and poverty. In the wet season, reliable\nflows and drainage will ensure crop survival during droughts and\nfloods, and reduce the risk of investing in inputs. Combined  with\nthe  introduction  of  modern  rice  varieties,  supplemental  wet\nseason irrigation will also permit double cropping. Dry season\nirrigation will permit the adoption of high-yield rice varieties and\ndiversification  into  higher  value  cash  crops.  Improved  roads\nreduce vehicle and harvesting costs, permit greater and timely\nuse of inputs, and generate other economic activities. Improved\nmarkets reduce spoilage and transaction costs. Combined, such\ninvestments will stimulate the rural economy and reduce poverty.\nObjectives and Scope The primary objectives of the Project are to increase agricultural\nproductivity  and  farmers\u2019  income,  and  stimulate  the  rural\neconomy by providing irrigation and drainage for 7,000 hectares\n(ha), and improving rural roads and markets in and around the", "iii\nproject area. To achieve these objectives, water user groups will\nbe formed  and  trained  to  operate  and  maintain  the  irrigation\nscheme, cost recovery measures will be applied for roads and\nirrigation works, government staff at the central and provincial\nlevel will be strengthened, and benefit monitoring and evaluation\nwill be introduced. The Project will also assist farmers to obtain\nlegal title to their lands.\nCost Estimates The total project cost is estimated at $23.8 million equivalent,\ncomprising $9.6 million (40 percent) in foreign exchange and\napproximately  $14.2  million  equivalent  (60  percent)  in  local\ncurrency costs.\nFinancing Plan ($ million)\nSource  Foreign          Local                  Total\nExchange     Currency       Cost     Percent\nADB 8.6 7.4 16.0 67\nAFD 1.0 1.6 2.6 11\nGovernment - 4.8 4.8 20\nBeneficiaries - 0.4 0.4 2\nTotal 9.6 14.2 23.8 100\nADB = Asian Development Bank, AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement.\nLoan Amount and Terms The equivalent  in  various  currencies  of  SDR12,183,000  from\nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The amortization period will be\n32 years including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest\ncharge of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent per annum thereafter.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2007\nExecuting Agencies The  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology  will  be\nresponsible  for  the  farmer  community  organization  and\nextension,  irrigation  infrastructure,  and  scheme  management\ncomponents;  the  Ministry  of  Rural  Development  will  be\nresponsible for the supporting infrastructure component.\nImplementation The overall project implementation period is six years. In the first\nArrangements two years, the landownership survey and titling activities will be\ncompleted, as well as technical investigations, consultations with\nfarmers on overall scheme management approach and system\nlayout, detailed design, and any necessary resettlement and/or\ncompensation  programs.  Civil  works  will  proceed  gradually,\nbeginning with the 2,000 ha designated for year-round irrigation,\nand  proceeding  to  the  5,000  ha  designated  to  receive\nsupplemental wet season irrigation.\nProcurement Goods  and  services  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works\nfor the irrigation infrastructure component, for the rehabilitation of", "iv\nStung  Chinit  and  Stung  Tang  Krasang  weirs,  Stung  Chinit\nspillway,  flood  embankments,  main  canal  structures  and\nearthworks, and secondary canal structures will be grouped in\none package and undertaken through international competitive\nbidding (ICB) by prequalified international contractors. All other\ncivil  works  related  to  this  component  involve  low-technology\nconstruction and are unlikely to be of interest to international\ncontractors.  The  remaining  works  will  be  undertaken  through\nlocal competitive bidding (LCB) or force account in accordance\nwith procedures acceptable to ADB.\nFor the supporting infrastructure component, civil works for road\nimprovement will be undertaken through LCB wherever possible,\nusing  labor-intensive  techniques,  and  in  accordance  with\nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Alternatively,  these  will  be\nimplemented by the project implementation unit recruiting labor\ngroups from among beneficiaries on a force account basis.\nMaterials and equipment to be financed under the Project will\nconsist  mainly  of  laterite  for  surfacing,  service  vehicles,\nmotorcycles,  a  small  amount  of  construction  equipment,  and\noffice furnishing and equipment. Laterite will be procured through\nLCB or by force account if it is extracted by beneficiary labor.\nOther supply contracts will also be valued at less than $500,000\nand be awarded using international shopping. The procurement\nof  materials  and  equipment  worth  less  than  $100,000  per\ncontract will be undertaken through direct purchase.\nConsulting Services The  Project  is  expected  to  use  114  person-months  of\ninternational  and  418  person-months  of  domestic  consulting\nservices. The consultants financed by ADB will be recruited in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement\nof domestic consultants.\nEstimated Project  End December 2006\nCompletion Date\nProject Benefits The Project is expected to provide a host of direct and indirect\nand Beneficiaries benefits  to  poor  farming  communities.  Irrigation  will  provide\nopportunities for higher yields in the wet season, for cultivation of\na  second  wet  season  rice  crop  and  new  dry  season  crops\nincluding vegetables and legumes. The Project is also expected\nto  result  in  higher fish  yields  in paddy  areas.  The  economic\ninternal rate of return (EIRR) for agricultural investments is 15.0\npercent. Rural road benefits have been quantified in terms of\nvehicle operating cost savings and agriculture producer surplus.\nThis component yields an EIRR of 32.4 percent. The combined\nproject EIRR is estimated at 19.1 percent. The construction and\nrehabilitation of irrigation works, roads, and markets will provide\nsubstantial direct employment for  people  living  in  the  project\narea.  The  benefits  of  improved  markets  have  not  been", "v\nquantified,  but  will  include  lower  spoilage  rates,  better\nconnections between  buyers and  sellers,  reduced  margins to\nintermediaries, and the creation of local markets for cash crops.\nFormalization  of  land  titles  will  also  provide  a  major,  but\nunquantified benefit in the project area. In combination, these\nbenefits will reduce poverty in the Project area and stimulate\neconomic growth.\nAll  project  components  have  been  designed  to  ensure  that\ngender  impacts  and  impacts  on  vulnerable  groups  are\naddressed.  The  beneficiary  population  includes  a  high\npercentage of households headed by women and may include\nhouseholds where the primary income earners are disabled. To\nensure that the concerns of women and vulnerable groups are\naddressed,  extensive  consultations  to  include  focus  group\ndiscussions  will  be  carried  out  during  the  design  phase  and\nappropriate mechanisms to address their special needs will be\nbuilt  into  the  project  design.  Women  will  be  adequately\nrepresented in the farmer  organizations,  including  water user\ngroups and committees.", "vi", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Stung Chinit Irrigation and Rural Infrastructure Project.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. Following the Paris Peace Accord for Cambodia in 1991, the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) approved the Special Rehabilitation Assistance loan (SRAL) for emergency rehabilitation\nof infrastructure, including some irrigation systems.1 During preparation of the SRAL, it became\nclear that there was scope for further investments in irrigation, as agriculture dominates the\neconomy and rural infrastructure was decimated by war. At the request of the Government, ADB\nfinanced technical assistance (TA) in 1997 to assess the feasibility of rehabilitating the Stung\nChinit irrigation system in Kompong Thom Province.2 The consultants focused their efforts on\nthe full development of the system, including an upstream dam and storage to provide wet and\ndry  season  irrigation  over  12,000  hectares  (ha).  Concerned  about  the  Government\u2019s\nimplementation capacity and the environmental impacts of the dam, ADB requested analysis of\na limited development option that would rehabilitate the existing system and use run-of-the-river\nflows to provide supplemental wet season irrigation for 12,000 ha and dry season irrigation for\n2,000 ha.3 Because the study was truncated due to deteriorating security and political turmoil in\n1997, ADB was unable to make a firm decision on whether to proceed with project processing.\nThe study was able to verify strong support for the Project by local people.\n3. Subsequently the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology (MOWRAM) requested\nTA to reassess the Project. The TA commenced in November 1999.4 The TA report concluded\nthat a limited development option providing supplemental wet season irrigation over 7,000 ha\nand dry season irrigation over 2,000 ha, and improving rural roads and markets in the project\narea would be a cost-effective way of increasing agricultural production and farmers' incomes,\nand stimulating the rural economy in the province. A socioeconomic survey of the project area\ncompleted in April 2000 confirmed widespread support for the Project and found that almost 60\npercent of the target beneficiaries live below the national poverty line. ADB and the Government\nagreed to proceed on the basis of the TA recommendations while keeping open the option for\nfuture development of a dam and storage reservoir. This report is based on the findings of the\nfeasibility studies; external reports from the project area; ADB missions; and discussions with\nGovernment  officials,  project  beneficiaries,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  international\nagencies involved in irrigation and rural roads. The project framework is given in Appendix 1.\n                                               \n1  Loan 1199-CAM: Special Rehabilitation Assistance, for $67.7 million, approved on 26 November 1992.\n2 TA 2592-CAM: Stung Chinit Water Resources Development, for $800,000, approved on 25 June 1996.\n3 The Government confirmed at the final tripartite meeting and subsequent meetings that a dam and storage reservoir\nmay be more appropriately considered as a second phase project.\n4  TA 3275-CAM: Study for Stung Chinit Water Resources Development Project, for $150,000, approved on\n13 October 1999.", "2\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n1. Overview\n4. Cambodia borders Thailand to the west and north, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to\nthe north, and Viet Nam to the east. More than 80 percent of its 11.4 million inhabitants live in\nrural areas. One of the least developed countries in the region and the world, Cambodia is\nmarked by low life expectancy and literacy, and high rates of infant mortality and poverty. The\nmost recent (1997) socioeconomic data indicate that 40 percent of the rural population live\nbelow the national poverty line of about $0.41 per person per day.5 Seventy-five percent of rural\npoor are from households involved in some type of agricultural activity. Although peace has\nbrought a measure of prosperity to the country, there is growing inequality in the distribution of\nincome per capita, with urban areas benefiting from economic growth far more than rural areas.\n5. Rural agriculture dominates the Cambodian economy, accounting for nearly half of gross\ndomestic product (GDP) and 90 percent of employment. Cambodia\u2019s real GDP growth slumped\nfrom an average of over 6 percent in 1991-1996 to only 1 percent following political turmoil in\n1997. The agriculture sector averaged less than 3 percent growth prior to 1997, and suffered in\n1997  and  1998  from  floods  and  drought.6  Only  a  fraction  of  cultivated  land  is  irrigated,\nproduction  costs  are  high  due  mostly  to  the  limited  transport  network,  and  agriculture\ntechnologies lag far behind regional norms. For the typical Cambodian farmer, unpredictable\nrice surpluses that depend crucially on the weather, plus limited fish and livestock, provide the\nsole source of cash.\n2.  The Impact of War on Agriculture\n6. Rice is the staple food of the country, is the most commonly traded commodity, and\naccounts for more than 60 percent of agricultural output and 90 percent of cultivated land. But\nduring the civil war from 1970 to 1975, Cambodia slipped from being a major exporter of rice, to\na net importer, to the brink of starvation.7 The next 15 years of civil strife, population dislocation,\nand neglect left rural infrastructure in shambles, destroyed human resources, and dramatically\nreduced agricultural output. During the period of Khmer Rouge control, all city dwellers were\nrelocated to the countryside and together with rural farmers organized into indentured labor\ngroups that were repeatedly moved to different provinces. All private property was abolished,\nmen and women were forced to live separately, eating became a communal activity, and daily\nrations set at one can of rice per person per day. The impact on civil society was profound\u2014\nmore than two decades later rural Cambodia is still marked by lack of social cohesion and low\ninvestment in land improvement for agriculture. Rice yields remain among the lowest in Asia,\naveraging 1.4-1.6 metric tons per hectare (t/ha) in the wet season and 2.5-3.0 t/ha in the dry\nseason, and many provinces suffer from food insecurity. Apart from rice, some cash crops are\ngrown close to urban centers, but to date there is only modest development of alternative crops\nin rural Cambodia.\n                                               \n5 National Institute of Statistics. 1997.

The main constraints to higher rice yields and crop diversification include (i) lack of\nirrigation facilities to tap groundwater and surface water resources, (ii) poor management and\nlittle or no farmer participation in the operation and maintenance (O&M) of existing irrigation\nsystems, (iii) poor infrastructure for transporting and marketing products, (iv) limited capacity of\npublic  institutions to  provide  agricultural  extension  services,  and  (v)  lack  of  research  and\ndevelopment of suitable farm technologies. To be effective, investments targeting agricultural\nproductivity will need to respond to all of these constraints in an integrated manner.\n8. Water resource management is an especially pressing challenge in Cambodia, which\nfaces annual floods and droughts, and sedimentation of waterways due to deforestation. Until\nrecently, the irrigation subsector was marked by lack of investments. Only 12 percent of rice\nareas currently receive some supplemental irrigation, and dry season rice may be grown on only\n6 percent of the total rice area. Where irrigation systems have been built, maintenance presents\na  problem  due  to  lack  of  resources  for  recurrent  expenditures  and  low  participation  by\nbeneficiaries. Organizing and training farmers for O&M and eventually management of irrigation\nsystems, and developing user fees for cost recovery are thus crucial elements to ensure the\nsustainability of future investments in irrigation.\n9. There is a growing need for the Government to develop a comprehensive approach to\nthe water sector with a clearly defined authority across agencies, modalities for stakeholder\nparticipation in setting the rights and responsibilities of water users, and separation of the\nresponsibilities  for  water  resource  management  and  service  delivery.  Appropriate  policies,\nlegislation, and institutional framework should also be defined and established to support these\nreforms,  and  the  concerned  agencies  given  substantial  capacity  development  in  terms  of\nplanning, coordination, and implementation. Systematic and well-defined investment strategies\nfor water resource management and service delivery also need to be developed.\n10. Another important issue in the agriculture sector is the unregulated use of dangerous\npesticides. Although the Government passed a law in 1998 to regulate the sale and use of\nchemicals, vaccines, and medicines in agriculture, to date implementation and enforcement of\nthe law is minimal, and pesticides banned in other countries are readily available in local\nmarkets. Farmers typically are unaware of the dangers to themselves and others from use of\nsuch chemicals, and agricultural runoff can distribute toxins to the Tonle Sap and into the\nhuman food chain through fish consumption. Improving the Government\u2019s capacity to monitor\nand enforce the Agricultural Materials Law will require a long-term, nationwide effort, but in the\nshort term the focus should be on reducing demand through education on the hazards and\ndemonstration of alternatives.\n4. Institutions\n11. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) has primary responsibility for\nthe  agriculture  sector,  and  is  in  the  process  of  developing  a  pilot  system  for  agricultural\nextension  with  bilateral  assistance.  Prior  to  1999,  MAFF  was  also  responsible  for  water\nresource  management,  particularly  irrigation,  through  its  General  Directorate  of  Irrigation,\nMeteorology  and  Hydrology  (GDIMH).  In  1999  GDIMH  was  separated  and  upgraded  to\nMOWRAM, an independent ministry. The third national institution relevant to agriculture is the\nMinistry of Rural Development (MRD); its responsibilities include rural roads. Each agency\nmaintains provincial departments, which serve as the focal point for implementation of aid-\nassisted  projects.  Although  all  three  ministries  suffer  from  lack  of  qualified  midlevel", "4\nprofessionals, the international community, including ADB, is dedicating substantial resources to\ninstitutional strengthening.\n5. The Project Area\na. Socioeconomic Profile\n12. The Project is located in the southwestern part of Kompong Thom adjacent to National\nRoad 6, and about 12-15 kilometers (km) east of the flood stage of the Tonle Sap. It is a rural\narea dominated by agriculture. The most recent household-level data (collected in March-April\n2000) indicates that nearly 60 percent of the people in the project area live below the national\npoverty line, compared with the national average of 40 percent for rural areas. Thirty-six percent\nof farmers surveyed borrowed money from local lenders last year to finance medical care and\nsmall investments in economic activity, and to cover food shortages at the end of the wet\nseason.  The province has  the highest  incidence of underweight  children,  and  the  second\nhighest incidence of stunted growth\u2014key measures of malnutrition. Kompong Thom ranks 18th\nout of 21 provinces on the human development index (HDI),8 which combines information on life\nexpectancy at birth, educational attainment, adult literacy, and real GDP per capita. Although it\nis close to Phnom Penh, it lags behind other agricultural areas in infrastructure and use of\nimproved agricultural technologies due to its location on the front lines of internal conflict.\nb. Agriculture\n13. Kompong Thom is a significant rice-growing area, with 128,000 ha of paddy and more\nthan a third of the total floating rice production nationwide. But rice production in the province\nsuffers from floods, droughts, and rat infestations. Drought periods of up to 15 days during the\nwet season can cause severe crop losses, and farmers report dry year yields of less than half\nthose of a wet year. Local varieties make up almost all of rice grown in the province. Although\nthe Government has a small agriculture extension staff, it is not adequate to fully meet the\nneeds of the province or the project area.\n14. A social assessment of the project area conducted in the 1997 TA was updated in\nMarch-April 2000 through household surveys in 13 villages. The survey found current rice yields\nat 1.2-1.4 t/ha, with a maximum of 2.4 t/ha (using modern varieties) and a minimum of 0.5 t/ha.\nThese yields compare poorly with those attained in neighboring countries because of lack of\nirrigation  and  agricultural  extension,  use  of  low-yield  rice  varieties  and  technologies,  and\nimpassable farm-to-market roads. Investments in fertilizer are low, and pesticide use is almost\nnonexistent. A few cash crops\u2014maize, mung beans, soya beans, cassava, and melons\u2014are\ngrown in the area, and irrigated with water traps and from a few shallow hand-dug wells.\nHouseholds are involved in some nonrice economic activities, including wood collection, fishing,\nanimal  husbandry,  and  services.  Communities  in  the  project  area  are  not  homogeneous.\nVillages to the east, near the Stung Chinit diversion weir, practice more dry season cropping\ndue to easier river access, and communities at the western extreme of the command area plant\nmore floating rice and practice fishing due to higher water levels in the wet season.\nc. Irrigation\n15. The Stung Chinit irrigation system was built by 40,000-100,000 forced laborers during\nthe Khmer Rouge era to provide supplemental wet season and limited dry season irrigation by\n                                               \n8  Royal Government of Cambodia. 1997. Cambodia Human Development Report. Phnom Penh.", "5\ndiverting flows of the Stung Chinit and Stung Tang Krasang rivers. The weir gates and control\nand diversion structures are no longer functioning, and some canals are filled with sediment or\nhave eroded banks, leaving many areas unsuitable for crops even in the wet season and\nentirely barren during the dry season. But the basic layout of the scheme is sound, the weir\nsuperstructures are  intact, and  many  of  the  canals  require  only  moderate earthwork. The\nsituation presents an opportunity to restore irrigation at less cost than to establish a new\nsystem.\n16. At present there are no formal farmer organizations  to  manage  water  in  the area,\nbecause the system is completely dysfunctional. In the early years of scheme operation, the\nmain canal and gates were controlled by military units, and secondary and tertiary canals were\nmanaged  by  districts,  communes,  and  villages.  There  are  no  written  records  of  these\narrangements. Farmers report high rice yields during this period, but almost all production was\nshipped to other parts of the country. During the  1980s,  scheme  management  apparently\nfaltered, and on several consecutive years downstream villages lost their floating rice crop when\nupstream villagers opened canal gates just before harvest time. This highlights the importance\nof coordinated, participatory system management, and full representation of all communities in\nany irrigation management authority.\nd. Rural Infrastructure\n17. Rural roads in the area are generally impassable through the wet season, well into\nDecember, except by oxcart. But with rights-of-way well established and a major, recently\nrehabilitated highway nearby,  these  roads  present an  opportunity  to  rapidly  improve  living\nconditions  in  adjacent  villages  and  reduce  transport  costs  with  a  moderate  investment  in\nrehabilitation. The major towns neighboring the project area lack adequate market facilities\nbeyond patches of cleared land with, at best, temporary plastic roofing. This is typical of rural\nCambodia\u2014the 1999 Cambodia Human Development Report notes that only 14 percent of\nvillages in the country have a permanent  market,  and  only  4  percent have access  to  an\nagricultural extension worker.9 All these circumstances constrain agricultural productivity and\nfarmers' incomes.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n18. The Government\u2019s First Five-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) for 1996-\n2000 and Strategic Plan for 1997-2001 lay a foundation for poverty reduction and economic\nrecovery focused on rural development. Key SEDP strategies that are directly relevant to the\nProject  include  (i)  the  achievement  of  poverty  reduction  and  broad  participation  in  the\ndevelopment process by focusing on rural development; (ii) substantial investment to upgrade\nphysical infrastructure, particularly rural roads; (iii) development of the productive base of the\nrural  economy  by  raising  rice  yields  for  food  security  and  eventually  for  export;  and  (iv)\nenhanced income opportunities for farm households by diversifying crops.10\n                                               \n9  Ministry of Planning. 1999.

Agriculture and Water Resources\n19. Major  policy  issues  in  agriculture  and  water  resources  are  addressed  under  the\nAgriculture  Sector  Program  (ASP),11  which  is  based  on  the  Sector  Development  Policy\nStatement of MAFF, and reflected in the 1996-2000 SEDP. The policy reforms under the ASP\nsupport the objectives of this plan and focus specifically on (i) improving property rights by\npreparing  a  new  land  law;  (ii)  liberalizing  fertilizer  pricing  and  marketing;  (iii) increasing\ndissemination of agricultural marketing and technological information; (iv) formulating a strategy\nfor microfinance; (v) defining an institutional framework for sustainable O&M of water resource\ninfrastructure;  (vi)  decentralizing  rural  development  activities  by  establishing  local  rural\ndevelopment committees; and (vii) facilitating divestment of the rubber subsector. In July 2000\nthe  Government  submitted  the  new  land  law  to  the  National  Assembly,  fulfilling  the  final\ncondition for release of the second tranche of ASP funds.\n20. The Government also recognizes the need for integrated water resources management\nbased on river basins, with appropriate stakeholder participation and coordination. Improvement\nin water resource management through physical investment as well as policy development, and\ninstitution building are essential elements of the strategy to boost agricultural productivity. An\ninitial effort is under way to codify water resources management with the drafting in early 2000\nof a water law, which is undergoing preliminary discussion by Government agencies. In January\n1999,  the  Government  issued  the  Circular  on  the  Implementation  Policy  for  Sustainable\nIrrigation System, which outlines the institutional arrangements and procedures to progressively\ntransfer O&M responsibilities for irrigation systems from the Government to farmer water user\ngroups. The policy is being implemented on a pilot basis in at least four aid-funded irrigation\nprojects. On the trade and marketing side, the Government has lifted a ban on rice exports and\nliberalized the market for fertilizer.\n2.  Rural Infrastructure\n21. In December 1999, MRD issued the Policy for Rural Roads. The policy sets a goal of\ndecentralized responsibility for road management to the province, communes, and villages on\nthe principle of users and beneficiaries pay, while MRD will provide advice on maintenance and\nlocal mobilization of resources. This policy has yet to be tested in practice, but lays a good\nfoundation for sustainable development of rural infrastructure. MRD has also adopted labor-\nbased  appropriate  technology  (LBAT)  for  rural  road  construction,  in  accordance  with  the\nGovernment\u2019s policies on employment creation and poverty reduction, and with emphasis on\ncreating opportunities (and where appropriate, establishing preferences) for participation by\ndisadvantaged groups. MRD is in the process of delegating engineering, supervision, and civil\nworks  requiring  substantial  equipment  to  the  private  sector, and  currently  is  training  local\ncontractors to meet its requirements.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n22. From 1992 to 1999, ADB provided Cambodia with 12 loans, totaling $286 million, and 65\nTA projects amounting to about $42.4 million. Three of the investment projects and nine TA\nprojects, totaling $65.1 million and $7.8 million, respectively, are in the agriculture and rural\ndevelopment sectors. Key  investments  in agriculture,  rural  development,  and  irrigation are\ndescribed here, and a complete list of external assistance to these sectors is presented in\nAppendix 2.\n                                               \n11  Loan 1445-CAM:  Agriculture Sector Program, for $30,000,000, approved on 20 June 1996.", "7\n23. External assistance to the water  resources  sector, especially for  irrigation,  is  small\nrelative to other infrastructure investments, and relatively new to the country despite the high\npriority given by the Government. Recently the Government asked ADB to help develop the\noverall policies, strategies, and programs for the water sector. In 1999 ADB provided TA to\nMOWRAM to strengthen its operational capacity for planning and implementing investment\nprojects, and to develop the necessary policies and institutions for integrated water resources\nmanagement.12\n24. The World Bank provided a $20 million loan to support the development of the Social\nFund under the Government\u2019s Council of Ministers. The Social Fund financed more than 1,400\nsubprojects for water supply, education, health, and village-level infrastructure facilities including\nsmall-scale irrigation in all 24 provinces. A follow-up loan of $25 million was approved in 1999.\nThe World Bank will also provide institutional strengthening and support rehabilitation of small-\nand medium-scale irrigation systems through MOWRAM as part of its $27.5 million Agriculture\nProductivity Improvement Project, which commenced in 2000.\n25. Several assistance agencies are implementing farmer-managed irrigation systems with\nvarious types of cost recovery measures for O&M. The European Union (EU) provided grant\nfunds to rehabilitate small- and medium-scale irrigation systems in six provinces as part of a $44\nmillion Support Program for the Agriculture Sector from 1994 to 1998. Water user groups have\nbeen established to operate and maintain these systems, collect user fees, and conduct various\nincome-generating activities. A $40 million second phase project commenced at the end of\n1999. Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) has provided grant funds since 1996 to\nrehabilitate coastal polders and organize beneficiary groups to fund and conduct O&M activities.\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), through its Programme on Food Security, is\ndeveloping seven small-scale irrigation pilot projects with farmer organizations and farmer field\nschools.\n26. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is providing technical support to\nMOWRAM and a $10 million grant for the rehabilitation of irrigation canals in Kandal Province\nfrom 1999 to 2001. JICA is also planning a five-year project for capacity building of engineers in\nMOWRAM and its provincial offices, commencing early in 2001.\n27. The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID), in association with the\nInternational Rice Research Institute (IRRI), has been assisting the Government since 1998 to\ndevelop agriculture research institutions and to support research programs for the development\nof improved rice varieties and rice-based farming systems. AusAID is also providing a $7 million\ngrant for 1997-2002 for institutional strengthening and human resource development of the\nnational agricultural extension system. These programs have contributed to increasing the area\nof  high-yield  variety  (HYV)  rice  under  irrigated  farming  during  the  dry  season.  Deutsche\nGesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit  (GTZ)  is  providing  assistance  in  agriculture\nextension as part of its Kompong Thom provincial development project.\n28. Several  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  have  provided  assistance  for  the\nrehabilitation of small-scale irrigation systems in the country. Their activities commenced in the\nearly 1990s, preceding bilateral and multilateral assistance. In the project area, the Adventist\nDevelopment and  Relief Agency  (ADRA)  is developing  groundwater  resources and  village\n                                               \n12 TA 3292-CAM: Capacity Building in the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology, for $796,000, approved\non 10 November 1999.", "8\nvegetable farming, helped form a district water management committee to operate and maintain\nwells and sanitation facilities, and built a market at Tang Krasang town.\n29. Construction of rural roads has been successfully supported by the International Labour\nOrganization  (ILO)  since  1992  and  ADB  since  1996.  The  Tertiary  Roads  Improvement\nProgramme, a cooperative arrangement between MRD, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW)\nand World Food Programme, is rehabilitating roads in parts of Kompong  Thom. All  these\nprojects use LBAT and recruit large groups of laborers from local communities that will use the\nroads.\nD. Lessons Learned\n30. The  1999  ADB  Portfolio  Review  Mission  found  that  the  Government\u2019s  project\nimplementation  capacity  is  generally  good,  although  weak  in  specific  areas.  Government\nagencies suffer from a shortage of skilled and experienced staff, due to poor initial conditions\naffected by civil turmoil in the past and low civil service salaries. Many staff trained under\nexternally-assisted  projects  and  programs  are  quickly  absorbed  by  the  private  sector.\nFurthermore, time-consuming decision making, including lack of delegation of authority to the\nproject  implementation  office,  has  constrained  the  implementation  of  some  projects.  The\nexperience of other funding agencies and NGOs in the country verifies these findings.\n31. Some parts of Cambodia suffer from a low level of social cohesion due to years of\npolitical and military conflict. Externally-assisted projects that include cooperative arrangements\nbetween  beneficiaries  have  proven  human-resource  intensive,  and  require  substantial\ninvestments of time and energy to mobilize participants. For irrigation projects, farmers need to\nbe convinced of the benefits of cooperation, they need to realize these benefits within the life of\nthe investment, and their organizations need to be recognized by the Government and protected\nby a legal framework.\n32. The following lessons have been incorporated into the design of the Project:\n(i)  Project design should be kept simple.\n(ii)  Provincial and district agencies of the Government should have active roles in\nimplementing projects that require beneficiary participation.\n(iii)  Prior to the commencement of physical works, an agreement should be reached\nwith beneficiaries regarding general design features, intended implementation\napproach, and subsequent O&M arrangements.\n(iv)  The  availability  of  sufficient  counterpart  funds  during  project  implementation\nshould be confirmed and closely monitored.\n(v)  Adequate consulting services must be provided to ensure the timely completion\nof  surveys,  detailed  designs,  and  effective  supervision  of  implementation.\nRealistic  implementation  schedules  must  provide  adequate  lead  time  for\npreparatory activities, especially for beneficiary consultations.\n(vi)  Sufficient authority should be delegated to the project implementation office to\navoid implementation delays.", "9\n33. Some of these findings are mirrored in ADB\u2019s analysis of past projects in the irrigation\nand rural development sector.13 Of particular relevance is the importance of close involvement\nof beneficiaries in project design, implementation, and management. This builds a foundation of\nownership that is a necessary condition for successful farmer participation in O&M and for cost\nrecovery. But strong ownership alone is not enough; farmers and key institutions also require\nadequate training. Finally, when local capabilities are constrained by financial, technical, and\nsociocultural  factors,  a  process  approach  is  recommended  to  ensure  flexibility  in  design,\nimplementation, and operation of irrigation systems.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n34. The major thrusts of ADB\u2019s country operational strategy (COS) include  (i)  pro-poor\nsustainable  economic  growth  in  populous  rural  areas,  (ii)  human  resource  and  social\ndevelopment, and (iii) promotion of private sector participation that addresses key institutional\nand infrastructure weaknesses. The COS recognizes that agricultural and rural development are\nkey  to pro-poor  sustainable economic  growth  in  Cambodia.  In  this  context,  key areas for\nimproving  agricultural  productivity  include  (i) providing  and  properly  maintaining  critical\ninfrastructure for irrigation, drainage, and rural transport; (ii) strengthening agricultural research\nand extension; (iii) promoting the private-sector participation in input supply, product processing,\nand marketing; and (iv) providing effective rural financial services.\n35. ADB\u2019s strategy is to assist the Government to develop a comprehensive approach to the\nwater  sector  with  clearly  defined  authority  across  agencies,  modalities  for  stakeholder\nparticipation in setting the rights and responsibilities of water users, and separation of the\nresponsibilities for water resource management and service delivery. ADB's capacity building\nTA is a first step in this direction. The TA includes (i) detailed sectoral overview, (ii) formulation\nof investment strategies, (iii) establishment of the institutional framework for sustainable O&M of\nirrigation systems, (iv) identification of an action agenda for the draft national water sector\npolicy, and (v) strengthening of planning and implementation capacities. These processes will\nbe enhanced by implementation of the Project. ADB will also facilitate aid coordination in the\nwater sector to promote a common approach in areas such as water user organizations for\nO&M of irrigation infrastructure, water policies and laws, and sectoral responsibilities across\nGovernment agencies.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n36. The Government\u2019s new policy on farmer management of irrigation systems is a key step\nto ensuring sustainability of future investments. Farmer ownership of irrigation investments is\ndeveloped by ensuring farmer participation in all aspects of development, from planning and\ndesign to construction and management. Full ownership of the system increases the likelihood\nthat farmers will shoulder a substantial share of costs for O&M. Although the new policy is being\nimplemented in AFD\u2019s Prey Nup project, the EU Le Programme de R\u00e9habilitation et d\u2019Appui au\nSecteur  Agricole  (PRASAC)  project  and  elsewhere,  it  needs  to  be  supported  by  a  legal\nframework, and adjustment of the method for calculating water user fees may be needed. The\nGovernment  has  agreed  to  implement  the  policy  under  the  Project  on  a  pilot  basis,  for\nrefinement based on practical experience and especially the views of farmers. The Government\nis also sponsoring a series of national  workshops  and field trips  to give all  stakeholders,\nincluding the aid community, an opportunity to contribute to policy development. The medium-\n                                               \n13  Asian Development Bank. 1995. Sector Synthesis of Postevaluation Findings in the Irrigation and Rural\nDevelopment Sector. Manila.", "10\nterm goal of these refinements is to achieve 100 percent cost recovery for O&M of secondary\ncanals and structures and on-farm facilities; the long-term goal of the policy is to achieve full\ncost recovery for all O&M activities.\n37. ADB recognizes good governance as one of the pillars of a sound poverty reduction\nstrategy,  especially  elements  of  accountability  for  Government  employees,  people\u2019s\nparticipation in the development process, predictability in the application of rules and laws, and\ntransparency in public sector decision making. The Project is designed to maximize people\u2019s\nparticipation from design to construction, to management of all major components. The role of\nfarmers  in  irrigation  system  management  will  ensure  not  only  that  decision  making  is\ntransparent, but that key decisions are made by the farmers themselves. Governance issues\nidentified in Cambodia that are directly relevant to the Project include lack of independent\nauditing  agencies,  land  disputes,  and  highly  centralized  administrative  structures.14  The\nProject's design addresses the audit issue by financing independent external audits based on\ninternational auditing standards.\n38. Landownership, registration, and titling are crucial issues for the success of agriculture\nimprovement, especially irrigation projects. As land values increase with the expectation of\nirrigation, there is a risk that target beneficiaries may be alienated from their lands because they\nlack land title or even less formal documentation, such as land certificates issued by local\ncommune chiefs. The Government\u2019s draft land law, prepared with ADB assistance, addresses\nmany outstanding issues on land policy, and was presented to the National Assembly in July\n2000. Once the law is adopted, detailed rules and regulations will be needed to implement it. A\nrecently  passed  subdecree15  will  simplify  and  accelerate the  procedures for  land  titling  of\nindividual  parcels,  using  a  new  orthophotomapping  and  survey  process  developed  in  the\nDepartment of Cadastre and Geography, with assistance from GTZ and the Government of\nFinland. This process will be used in the project area in the first two years of implementation to\nassist target beneficiaries to obtain land titles.\n39. By establishing development committees at village, commune, and provincial levels, the\nASP  provided  support  for  the  Government\u2019s  initiative  to  decentralize  planning  and\nimplementation  of  development  interventions, and  involve  target  beneficiaries  in  their  own\ndevelopment. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) supported a similar effort\nfrom the early 1990s. From that experience, the Government is now moving to establish elected\ncommune  councils  by  early  2001.  Although  the  functions  of  commune  councils  and  their\nrelationship with national Government representatives at provincial and district levels, as well as\nwith the existing development committees are yet to be defined, the councils are expected to\nplay  a  key  role  in  planning  and  implementing  development  activities  in  the  concerned\ncommunes. In terms of project implementation, the focus of institutional strengthening will be at\nthe provincial and district levels, and that of extension services at the commune and village\nlevels. Focusing on the different levels will ensure the sustainability of services in the project\narea and recognizes that MOWRAM and other agencies need substantial human resource\ndevelopment at the local level. This strategy requires MOWRAM to dedicate more resources to\nKompong Thom; the ministry has committed to do this.\n                                               \n14  Kato,  T.,  J.  A.

Although the Government has limited capacity to enforce the Agricultural Materials Law,\nwhich establishes a regime to control the supply and use of certain pesticides, fertilizers, and\nanimal medicines, MAFF is committed to reducing the demand for dangerous substances by\nsupporting  integrated  pest  management  (IPM).  The  Project  follows  a  similar  approach  by\nincluding IPM as part of a package of agricultural extension services, and provides training for\nprovincial MAFF extension workers on IPM techniques and dissemination.\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n41. The  Government  places  high  priority  on  reducing  poverty  by  improving  the  rural\neconomy. ADB\u2019s strategy in Cambodia supports this objective by focusing investments in the\npopulous and poor rural areas of the plains and Tonle Sap region, such as Kompong Thom\nProvince.  The  provincial  economy  is  dominated  by  rural  subsistence  or  semisubsistence\nfarming dependent on one low-yield rain-fed rice crop per year, with limited employment and\nincome-generating opportunities during the dry season. Periodic droughts in the wet season, or\nsevere flooding, force families into debt to meet their subsistence food needs. Due to lack of\nirrigation, most lands lie barren and fallow in the dry season. The project area presents an\nopportunity to address these problems as it has abundant water resources, an existing irrigation\nsystem that will need only low-cost rehabilitation, and its proximity to a major highway and to\nPhnom Penh.\n42. The provision of irrigation and drainage, rural roads, and markets can have an important\nimpact on agricultural productivity. In the wet season, reliable flows and drainage ensure crop\nsurvival during drought periods and floods, reduce the risk of investing in inputs, and, when\ncombined with the introduction of modern rice varieties, permit double cropping. Dry season\nirrigation will provide a large boost to farmers' incomes, and permit the adoption of high-yield\nvarieties and diversification into higher value cash crops. Improved roads (most rural roads in\nthe project area are impassable except by oxcart) will reduce vehicle and harvesting costs, and\nallow greater and timely use of inputs, while stimulating other economic activities. Improved\nmarkets will reduce spoilage and transaction costs.\n43. The returns to investments in hardware can be greatly enhanced by complementary\ninvestments in human capital. Thus, training in improved agricultural techniques, IPM, and on-\nfarm water management should go hand in hand with the provision of irrigation. Participation in\nconstruction  and  the  O&M  of  roads  and  irrigation  systems  imparts  skills  to  beneficiaries,\nprovides much-needed employment, and ensures the sustainability of infrastructure. Finally, if\nfarmers are assisted in obtaining legal title to their lands, they are much more likely to invest in\nimproved agricultural techniques and technology, and to participate in O&M of the irrigation\nsystem.\n44. In  combination,  these  hardware  and  software  investments  can  stimulate  the  rural\neconomy and have a measurable impact on farmers' incomes. By improving rural infrastructure\nand establishing a workable system for agricultural extension, crop diversification, and farmer-\nmanaged irrigation, the Project will also prepare the way for a second-stage investment in an\nupstream dam that will greatly expand dry season irrigation.", "12\nB. Objectives and Scope\n45. The primary objectives of the Project are to raise agricultural productivity and increase\nfarmers' incomes by providing irrigation and drainage for 7,000 ha, and improving rural roads\nand markets in and around the project area. The Project will also (i) form and train water user\ngroups to operate and maintain the irrigation system, (ii) apply cost recovery measures for roads\nand irrigation works, (iii) strengthen Government staff at the central and provincial level, and (iv)\nconduct benefit monitoring and evaluation.\n46. The Project will have the following components.\n1. Irrigated Agriculture Development (Part A)\na. Farmer Community Organization and Extension Services\n47. This component will address the software requirements for ensuring that the provision of\nwater results in sustainable increases in agricultural productivity that benefit local farmers. The\ncomponent involves investing in human resource development, community organization and\ntraining, and applied research and extension, through three subcomponents:\n(i)  Landownership survey and documentation for land registration and titling. Using\northophotomapping and ground surveys, the Project will assist farmers to obtain\nlegal title to their lands. Completed orthophotomaps will also be used for the\ndetailed design of water offtakes from the secondary canals and for the formation\nof water user groups.\n(ii)  Water user groups. The Project will help mobilize, form, and train farmer water\nuser  groups  (WUGs),  who  will  elect  members  to  the  farmer  water  user\ncommunities (WUCs) at the secondary canal level. The WUGs and WUCs will be\nthe focal points for farmer participation in system design and O&M, and for\ntraining in water management.\n(iii)  Agriculture extension services and research. The Project will provide extension\nservices including farmer field schools and demonstrations on IPM, improved rice\nseed  and  rice  farming  techniques,  crop  diversification,  land  leveling,  animal\nhusbandry, and postharvest practices. Provincial government agencies\u2019 capacity\nto provide long-term extension services will be strengthened.\nb. Irrigation Infrastructure\n48. Civil works under this component will (i) repair the main diversion weirs on the Stung\nChinit river and its tributary, the Stung Tang Krasang; (ii) repair flood bunds, construct new\nbunds on the eastern side of the main canal, and provide drainage structures to protect low-\nlying agricultural areas between the two rivers; (iii) introduce a fish pass structure to allow\nannual fish migrations; (iv) remodel and repair the main and secondary canals and regulators,\nalong with roughly 60 km of embankment service roads; (v) provide assistance to farmers\nconstructing tertiary and quaternary canals; (vi) establish  hydrometeorology  stations  in  the\nStung Chinit catchment area; and (vii) provide field offices and equipment.", "13\nc. Irrigation System Management\n49. The system management component will establish the Stung Chinit irrigation committee,\nresponsible for overall management of the system, and develop a system for farmer-managed\nO&M and cost recovery through WUGs and WUCs. The component will develop the capacity of\nthe  committee  and  MOWRAM  staff  in  all  technical  and  administrative  aspects  of  system\nmanagement.\n2. Rural Infrastructure (Part B)\n50. This component will improve roughly 150 km of rural roads in and around the project\narea to reduce the cost of transporting inputs and harvested crops, in anticipation of increased\nvolumes of both stemming from greater agricultural production. In addition, the Project will\nupgrade six local markets that currently lack permanent roofing, drainage, access to clean\nwater, truck-loading facilities, and sanitation facilities. The final selection of roads and markets\nduring project implementation will give strong preference to the views of target beneficiaries\nthrough surveys and meetings at the village, commune, and district levels.\nC. Cost Estimates\n51. The total project cost is estimated at about $23.8 million equivalent, including physical\nand price contingencies, duties, taxes, and interest charges. Of this, about $9.6 million or 40\npercent is the foreign exchange cost. Local currency costs including duties and taxes are\nestimated at $14.2 million equivalent, or 60 percent of the total cost. The cost estimates are\nsummarized in Table 1. Detailed costs estimates are in Appendix 3.\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nItem\nExchange Currency Cost\nA.\n     1.

Financing Plan\n52. It is proposed that ADB finance $16 million equivalent (67 percent) of the total project\ncost covering the foreign exchange cost and $7.4 million equivalent of the local currency cost.\nAFD has expressed interest to provide grant cofinancing amounting to $2.6 million equivalent\n(11 percent) of the total project cost, on a parallel basis, for the entire farmer community\norganization and extension services component, and water quality monitoring and fisheries\nresearch in the irrigation system management component of Part A. The Government and the\nbeneficiaries will finance $5.2 million equivalent of local currency cost (22 percent of the total\nproject cost). Beneficiary contribution is through labor to construct tertiary and quaternary canals\nand drains within their parcels.\n53. As  AFD  funds  will  be  provided  on  a  parallel  basis,  AFD  will  be  responsible  for\nadministering their activities together with MOWRAM, in close coordination with ADB.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percent\nADB (including interest 8.6 7.4 16.0 67\ncharges)\nAFD 1.0 1.6 2.6 11\nGovernment 0.0 4.8 4.8 20\nBeneficiaries 0.0 0.4 0.4 2\nTotal a 9.6 14.2 23.8 100\nADB = Asian Development Bank, AFD = Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement.\na Totals may not tally due to rounding.\n54. The Borrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia. The loan will be from ADB\u2019s Special\nFunds resources with a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years. The loan will carry\nan interest rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period, and 1.5 percent per annum\nthereafter.\nE. Executing Agencies\n55. The  Project  Executing  Agencies  (EAs)  will  be  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and\nMeteorology (MOWRAM) and the Ministry of Rural Development. MOWRAM will be responsible\nfor three subcomponents: farmer community organization and extension services, irrigation\ninfrastructure, and irrigation system management, and MRD will be responsible for the rural\ninfrastructure  component.  The  provincial  Department  of  Agriculture,  Forests  and  Fisheries\n(PDAFF)  will  provide  support for agriculture  extension  activities,  along  with the  Cambodia\nAgriculture Research Development Institute. The Department of Cadastre and Geography of the\nMinistry of Land Management, Urban Planning, and Construction (MLM) will conduct the land\nownership survey and titling activities.\n56. Project sustainability depends on the strength of institutions, sense of ownership by\nGovernment and beneficiaries, and financial mechanisms for cost recovery. Both MRD and\nMOWRAM have increased their technical and project management skills considerably through", "15\npractical experience on projects financed by ADB and others. Although irrigation systems can\nbe more complex to operate and maintain than rural roads, MOWRAM will build its  skills\ncontinuously during the investment period through on the job training by the implementation\nconsultants, and new or planned institutional strengthening projects.\nF. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Project Organization and Coordination\n57. MOWRAM  and  MRD  will  establish  project  management  offices  (PMOs)  at  their\nministries, headed by national project directors at the level of undersecretary of state; and\nproject implementation units (PIUs) in Kompong Thom, headed by the director of the Provincial\nDepartment of Water Resources and Meteorology (PDWRAM) and director of the Provincial\nDepartment of Rural Development (PDRD), respectively. Both PIUs will have full-time deputy\nproject managers, plus full-time engineering, technical, and administrative staff. By the end of\nyear  two  of  the  Project,  once  farmer  organizations  are  in  place  and  have  elected  their\nrepresentatives, MOWRAM will establish an office for the Stung Chinit irrigation committee, with\npermanent staff comprising engineers, canal inspectors, and gate operators.\n58. Interministerial coordination will be provided through a project steering committee (PSC),\nchaired  by  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF),  and  comprising  the  national  project\ndirectors from MOWRAM and MRD, and representatives of other ministries involved in the\nProject. The PSC will be responsible for overall coordination of the Project and interagency\ndispute  resolution. At the  provincial  level,  a  project  coordination  committee  (PCC)  will  be\nestablished. The PCC will be chaired by the project manager, PIU-MOWRAM, and will include\nthe MRD project manager as deputy chairperson, and representatives from relevant provincial\nagencies, the Stung Chinit resettlement subcommittee (SCRS), and the Stung Chinit irrigation\ncommittee. The PCC will coordinate implementation activities and make adjustments in work\nprograms. A project organization and coordination chart is in Appendix 4.\na. Land Ownership Survey and Titling\n59. The  land  ownership  survey  and titling  component  will  be  implemented  through  the\nDepartment  of  Cadastre  and  Geography  in  MLM.  The  process  will  begin  with  NGO-led\nworkshops to explain to villagers their land rights and the planned cadastral activities. The\ndepartment will prepare a cadastral index map of villagers\u2019 landholdings in the project area\nbased on aerial survey, ground truthing,  interviews,  demarcation,  and  adjudication of  land\nparcels. This process, including procedures for dispute resolution, is spelled out in a new\nsubdecree on the Procedures of Establishing Cadastral Index Map and Land Register. The final\noutput  of  this  component  will  be  land  registration  and  submission  of  all  necessary\ndocumentation for issuance of title certificates for all parcels in the project area.\nb. Farmer Organization\n60. The guiding philosophy of the irrigation system is bottom-up management. The Project\nwill help form and train WUGs at the 50-ha-block level to participate in the design phase of the\nsystem, construct tertiary and quaternary canals and drains with material and TA from the\nGovernment,  and  contribute  labor  and  collect  user  fees  to  finance  the  maintenance  of\nsecondary canals and drains. The WUGs will elect representatives to WUCs at the secondary\ncanal level to represent their interests on the Stung Chinit irrigation committee (para. 64). The\nWUCs will be responsible for operating secondary canals and drains, will organize the WUGs", "16\nfor canal and drain maintenance, and manage maintenance funds collected from the WUGs. To\nleverage consulting inputs, qualified NGOs will be used to mobilize farmers, conduct training,\nand  implement  public  awareness  campaigns\u2014a  model  that  AFD  found  to  be  effective  in\nCambodia. NGOs can also be  used to  more effectively  target  vulnerable  groups  such as\nhouseholds headed by women, households with disabled persons, and minorities.\nc. Agricultural Extension and Research\n61. Extension activities will include, (i) farmer field schools, (ii) field demonstrations for IPM,\n(iii) demonstration plots for improved rice varieties and alternative dry season crops, (iv) land\nleveling,  and  (v)  postharvest  processing  to  improve  the  quality  of  milled  rice.  Agriculture\nextension will be based on the systems, expertise, and materials developed in MAFF and the\nprovincial Office of Technique, Economic and Extension (OTEE), which will be the Implementing\nAgency  for  this  component.  The  Cambodia  Agriculture  Research  Development  Institute\n(CARDI) will conduct adaptive research activities to support OTEE in the field. AFD plans to\nexpand the agricultural extension services subcomponent to include microcredit facilities for\nfarmers,  through  their  ongoing  work  with  Ennatien  Moulethan  Tchonnebat  (EMT),  a  local\nmicrofinance institution.\nd. Irrigation Infrastructure\n62. The irrigation infrastructure component will be managed by the PIU in Kompong Thom,\nwith the assistance of the implementation consultants and monitored by the PMO. Major civil\nworks  including  remodeling  of  the  main  canal  and  rehabilitation  of  the  weirs  and  control\nstructures in the main and secondary  canals  will  be  undertaken  by a  contractor  engaged\nthrough international competitive bidding (ICB). Simple earthworks for secondary canals and\ndrains may be contracted directly to WUCs and WUGs, under the technical guidance of the PIU\nand implementation consultants, or through civil works contracts that require the use of local\nlabor along the canal wayleave. The guiding philosophy of the civil works is participation of the\ntarget beneficiaries in determining the location of offtakes, ease of O&M, and longevity of\nstructures. Farmers will participate in system design from the outset to determine the optimal\narrangement of canals, drains, and water management structures. At least two thirds of farmers\nalong each secondary canal in the command area will have to endorse and sign off on the\ndesign  of  secondary  canals  and  offtakes  and  tertiary  block  boundaries  before  they  are\nincorporated in the overall design. For some small civil works, such as the rehabilitation of\nflood embankments east of the diversion weirs, the United Nations World Food Programme\n(WFP) will also participate to target vulnerable groups that do not directly benefit from irrigation,\nand provide rice, fish, oil, and salt as payment to participants doing piece work.\n63. MOWRAM will be responsible for O&M of the main canal, weirs, cross-regulators and\ncross-drainage structures. The Project will provide funds for routine maintenance, but on a\ndeclining  percentage  over  time,  and  the  Government  share  of  maintenance  will  increase\nproportionately to 80 percent of the total during project implementation. The total annual budget\nrequirement of about $130,000 equivalent for the Government's contribution to O&M is modest\nin relation to total GDP and the national revenue budget. WUCs will be responsible for O&M of\nsecondary canals, using labor and funds raised through fees collected by WUGs equivalent to\nabout $10/ha. This is affordable to farmers who in the most pessimistic scenario will gain a\nminimum of $84 in annual income just from supplemental wet season irrigation. Farmers that\nalso receive dry season irrigation will be expected to pay higher fees reflecting higher water\nusage. Social assessments completed during project preparation found farmers willing to pay\nwater user fees. AFD and EU agriculture projects in Cambodia have successfully implemented", "17\nfees of the same magnitude, with payment in cash, rice, or labor. Their experience shows that\nuser fees should not be imposed from above, but rather developed through a consensus of\nWUG membership. Not surprisingly, farmers are more willing to make contributions once they\nrealize measurable gains from agriculture. It is therefore unrealistic to expect significant fee\ncollection in the early stages of the Project. The objective of user fees is to eventually recover\n100 percent of the costs of O&M of secondary canals and structures.\ne. Irrigation System Management\n64. The  system  will  be  managed  by  the  Stung  Chinit  irrigation  committee,  comprising\nelected representatives from the WUCs and PDWRAM technical staff. The committee will be\nchaired by a representative of the WUC, and will have farmers as majority members. At least 20\npercent  of  seats  on  the  committee  will  be  reserved  for  women,  reflecting  the  share  of\nhouseholds headed by women in the project area. The committee, with assistance from the PIU\nand  implementation  consultants,  will  (i)  develop  gate  operating  schedules;  (ii)  calibrate\nstructures to ensure equitable distribution of water; (iii) prepare maintenance schedules and\nbudgets and package routine maintenance tasks into contracts for the WUCs/WUGs; (iv) foster\nactive farmer participation,  through  the WUCs and  WUGs,  in  system  O&M  activities,  and\n(v) prepare a detailed O&M manual to guide future management of the system. A diagram of\nsystem management arrangements is presented in Appendix 5.\nf. Rural Infrastructure\n65. The  rural  infrastructure  component  will  be  implemented  by  PDRD,  with  technical\nguidance  and  support  from  MRD  and  the  implementation  consultants.  Roads  will  be\nrehabilitated in the command area of the irrigation system and peripheral areas in Baray and\nSantuk districts using the LBAT model pioneered and used successfully in Cambodia by ILO\nsince 1992, and currently used in ADB\u2019s Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project (RIIP). Under\nthe LBAT model, up to 40 percent of road construction expenditures are paid directly to local\ncommunities as wages. PDRD or beneficiary groups will propose individual road links and\nmarkets for consideration by the Provincial Rural Development Committee (PRDC). PDRD will\nprepare detailed financial and economic appraisals for all proposals. PRDC will recommend\npriority roads and markets to MRD according to the selection criteria used in RIIP.\n66. Rural roads will require routine and periodic maintenance.16 The Project will provide\nfinancial support to cover the maintenance of rural roads, but on a declining share over time,\nand the Government share of maintenance will increase proportionately. This will ensure that\nthe Government shoulders the burden of maintenance before the Project is completed. The\nProject  will  test  alternative  surfacing  materials  that  carry  a  higher  capital  cost  but  lower\nmaintenance costs, and assess their technical and economic viability as well as replicability in\nthe Project, taking into account the initial testing being conducted with the assistance of ILO.17\nFinally, the Project will experiment with the formation of road user committees to mobilize local\nfunds and labor for maintenance, as described in MRD\u2019s policy on rural roads (para. 21).\n                                               \n16  Routine maintenance must be done on a regular basis to ensure the continued operation of roads. It includes\nactivities such as filling potholes. This is conducted at relatively low cost ($300 per year per kilometer) using the\nLBAT model. Periodic maintenance involves overlaying of surface materials once every three to five years with a\nmaximum cost of $4,000 per kilometer.\n17  An  initial  assessment  by  ILO  indicates  that  using  basalt  blocks  for  road  surfacing  requires  high  initial\ninvestments, but may prove to be economically viable over the long run due to substantially lower maintenance\nrequirements. This finding needs to be assessed on a wider scale.", "18\n67. For  the  O&M  of  rural  markets,  the  Project  will  follow  the  design  under  RIIP,  by\nestablishing market committees in district or commune councils before upgrading the market\nwith the agreement of market traders.18 The committee will operate the market, and establish\nstall  rental  fees  that  will  cover  at  least  the  cost  for  regular  O&M  and  a  fund  for  further\nmaintenance and improvement of the market.\n2. Implementation Arrangements under Parallel Financing\n68. ADB and AFD have agreed on the general activities, cost estimates, and outline terms of\nreference for the farmer organization and agricultural extension component. AFD may improve\nthe design of the component, reflecting its broad experience in Cambodia. All such changes will\nbe  agreed  upon  beforehand  with  ADB.  As  parallel  financiers,  AFD  and  MOWRAM  will\nadminister the component. Because of the close linkages between the components in part A,\nAFD- and ADB-financed consultants will work together as a team, share the same PIU office\nspace, and attend meetings of the PCC, National Steering Committee, or other bodies where\nthe  presence  of  implementation  consultants  is  required.  Furthermore,  both  groups  of\nconsultants will produce joint progress and project completion reports, participate in benefit\nmonitoring and evaluation, and participate jointly in midterm reviews. These understandings will\nbe specified in a memorandum of understanding to be signed by AFD, ADB, and MOWRAM\nprior to loan effectiveness.\n3. Implementation Schedule\n69. The  overall  project  implementation  period  is  six  years.  In  the  first  two  years,  the\nlandownership survey and titling activities will be completed, as well as technical investigations,\nconsultations  with  farmers  on  overall  system  management  approach  and  system  layout,\ndetailed design, and any necessary resettlement and/or compensation programs. Civil works\nwill proceed gradually, beginning with the 2,000 ha designated for year-round irrigation, and\nproceeding to the remaining 5,000 ha that will receive supplemental wet season irrigation. The\nimplementation schedule is presented in Appendix 6.\n4. Procurement\n70. Procurement under the Project will be in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines for\nProcurement. ICB will be used for major civil works contracts in excess of $1 million and supply\ncontracts over $500,000. Specifically, in the irrigation infrastructure component, civil works for\nthe rehabilitation of Stung Chinit and Stung Tang Krasang weirs, Stung Chinit spillway, main\ncanal  structures  and  earthworks  will  be  grouped  in  one  package  and  undertaken  by  a\nprequalified contractor to be engaged through ICB. Prequalification criteria will be designed to\nensure that the international contractor or associates have adequate experience and technical\nand financial capabilities. All other civil works related to this component involve low-technology,\nlabor-intensive construction and are unlikely to be of interest to international contractors. These\ncivil  works  will  be contracted  directly  to WUCs  and WUGs  and  undertaken  through force\naccount, or packaged for local contractors through local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures\nacceptable to ADB.\n71. Because of the simple nature of the civil works for the rural infrastructure component,\nthey  are  unlikely  to  be  of  interest  to  international  contractors.  The  civil  works  for  road\n                                               \n18  In markets where the private sector is willing to take on the responsibility of improving facilities, the Project will\nlimit the activities to upgrading common infrastructure such as roads, paving, and drainage.", "19\nimprovement  will  be  undertaken  through  LCB  wherever  possible,  using  labor-intensive\ntechniques, and in accordance with procedures acceptable to ADB. Alternatively, these will also\nbe implemented through the recruitment of labor groups from among beneficiaries by the PIU on\na force account basis.\n72. Materials and equipment to be financed under the Project will consist mainly of laterite\nfor surfacing, service vehicles, motorcycles, a small amount of construction equipment, and\noffice furnishing and equipment. Laterite will be procured through LCB or by force account if it is\nextracted by beneficiary labor. Other supply contracts valued at less than $500,000 will be\nawarded under international shopping. The procurement of materials and equipment worth less\nthan $100,000 per contract will be undertaken through direct purchase.  Tentative  contract\npackages are included in Appendix 7.\n5. Disbursement of Loan Proceeds\n73. To ensure the timely release of loan proceeds, Imprest Accounts will be established for\nMOWRAM and MRD, who will manage fund flows to their respective PIUs at the provincial level.\nThe imprest accounts will be operated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.\nFor further simplification of disbursements, the EAs can use the statement of expenditure\nprocedure for contracts costing less than $50,000 or the equivalent in local currency.\n6. Consulting and NGO Services\n74. The Government will engage ADB-financed consultants through several packages to\nassist in the implementation of the Project and transfer of technology. MOWRAM will recruit\nconsultants for part  A  comprising  77 person-months  of  international  and  202  of  domestic\nspecialists with expertise in engineering for detailed irrigation design, supervision of civil works,\ntraining, project and contract management, and fisheries. The lead firm will act as engineer for\nirrigation  system  design  and  construction,  with  sufficient  delegated  authority  to  effectively\nsupervise the ICB contract on behalf of MOWRAM, and liability for successful completion of civil\nworks. MRD will recruit consultants for part B comprising 15 person-months of international and\n60 of domestic specialists with expertise in road and market engineering, supervision of civil\nworks,  training,  and  social  organization  and  mobilization.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for the use of domestic consultants.\n75. AFD will use its own procedures for recruiting consultants for the farmer community\norganization and extension services component of part A, comprising 22 person-months of\ninternational and 156 of domestic specialists. Expertise is required in mobilization of farmers\nand organization of WUGs, and agronomy. Domestic NGOs will be recruited under the AFD-\nfinanced component to assist with farmer mobilization, training, and socioeconomic surveys. For\nthe fisheries research and water quality monitoring activities, AFD will engage the Mekong River\nCommission Secretariat (MRCS) on a sole-source basis because of its extensive experience in\nthe field and in the ongoing project for Management of Freshwater Capture Fisheries (which\nruns through 2005).\n76. The relatively large input of consulting services is justified by the integrated cross-sector\ndesign of the Project, the importance of organizing and training farmers to ensure sustainable\nO&M of the system, the lack of strong social cohesion in rural areas, and the low level of human\nresource capacity at the provincial level of Government to manage the system at the outset.\nFurthermore, many of the skills and technology transferred under the Project can be applied to", "20\nfuture water resource development projects, and thus confer a benefit beyond the Project. The\noutline terms of reference for loan- and grant-financed consulting services are presented in\nAppendix 8.\n7. Advance Procurement Action\n77. At the request of the Government, ADB has approved advance procurement action in\nengaging the ADB-financed consultants. By starting the time-consuming process of consultant\nselection early, it will be possible to avoid implementation delays and  rapidly  start farmer\nmobilization and irrigation system design. MOWRAM and MRD have been advised that the\napproval of advance procurement action does not commit ADB to finance the Project.\n8. Midterm Reviews\n78. ADB will conduct regular annual reviews throughout project implementation. MOWRAM,\nMRD, ADB, and AFD will jointly undertake two comprehensive midterm reviews, in mid-2002\nand end-2004. The reviews will cover the entire Project to determine whether adjustments are\nnecessary in system design, implementation arrangements, and fund allocation. The reviews\nwill also address outstanding procurement problems, financing and scheduling matters, the\ndevelopment  impact  of  the  Project,  and  progress  of  the  training  programs  and  farmer\norganization.\n9. Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n79. MOWRAM and MRD will maintain records and accounts adequate to (i) identify goods\nand  services financed out  of  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  and  from  counterpart  local  funds;\n(ii) identify the use of these goods and services for the Project; (iii) record the progress of the\nProject, including its costs; and (iv) reflect, in accordance with sound accounting principles, the\nProject\u2019s operational and financial condition. MOWRAM and MRD, with assistance from the\nimplementation consultants, will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly progress reports covering\nitems (i) through (iv). The detailed format for these reports will be included in the Project\nAdministration Memorandum (PAM).\n80. In preparing the project accounts, MOWRAM and MRD will make use of the Project\nAccounting  Manual  prepared  for  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF)  with  ADB\nassistance. The project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually by an\ninternationally  qualified  accountant,  using  loan  proceeds.  Audited  reports  and  financial\nstatements will be submitted to ADB not later than 12 months after the fiscal year to which they\nrelate.\n10. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n81. As one of the larger irrigation development projects to be undertaken in Cambodia in\nrecent times, this project provides an opportunity to assess the development and success of\nfarmer group formation and capacity building where there is little prior experience, and provides\nsufficient  period  to  adjust  O&M  procedures  over  time  based  on  early  results.  As  current\ncropping patterns, sources of income, and other features of households in the project area are\nnot  homogeneous,  careful  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME)  can  reveal  both  the\ngeographic distribution of benefits, and the Project\u2019s success in reaching the most needy,\nvulnerable households. Success hinges on adequate baseline data and consistent follow-up\nsurveys. The implementation consultant will compile socioeconomic baseline data using the (i)", "21\n1997  TA  social  assessment;  (ii)  a  recent  household  survey  prepared  by  AFD;  (iii) latest\nCambodia Socioeconomic Survey (CSES); (iv) annual provincial, district, and commune data;\nand (v) if necessary, additional household surveys. Follow-up socioeconomic surveys will be\nconducted at midterm and near completion by the PIUs with the assistance of the consultant\nand participation of local communities either directly or under the auspices of the NGO involved\nin farmer mobilization. The follow-up surveys will measure the impact on cropping intensity,\nyields, crop diversification, transport costs, farmer incomes, and general economic activity. The\nProject will also be monitored for environmental impacts through a research program to test the\neffectiveness  of  the  fish  pass  structure,  and  through  water  quality  monitoring  to  test  the\neffectiveness of IPM training. The MRCS will manage both activities in coordination with the\nPDWRAM PIU, with financing from AFD. To the extent possible, target beneficiaries will be\ninvolved in monitoring activities.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n82. The Project is  classified  as  environmental  category  B,  and an  initial  environmental\nexamination (IEE) was conducted as part of project preparation. A summary IEE (SIEE) is\npresented in Appendix 9. Two major environmental concerns associated with the Project are the\nimpacts of the restored weirs on migratory fish and the impact of the use of pesticide and\nfertilizers in the project area. The rehabilitation of existing rural roads will not have any negative\nimpact on Tonle Sap or other environmentally sensitive areas along the alignment. Although\nsmall  borrow  pits  may  be  required  for  some  roads,  they  will  be  rehabilitated  with  due\nconsideration for the needs of the local communities and, where appropriate, converted to\nfishponds or to provide water for irrigation of household gardens.\n83. The fish populations of the Stung  Chinit and Stung Tang Krasang  can be  broadly\nclassified into two groups: fish of the upper forested catchment areas and fish of the lower\nsections of the two rivers. There are both migratory and nonmigratory fish in the lower sections\nof both  rivers.  The  project  impact  on the  upper forested catchment area fisheries  will  be\nminimal. The Project will likely have a positive impact on the nonmigratory fish population\nbecause of the increase in standing water behind the weirs. Fisherfolk living close to the Stung\nChinit and Stung Tang Krasang weirs were unanimous in their opinion that they had greater fish\ncatches when the irrigation system was in operation prior to 1989. In the absence of any\nmitigation measures, the rehabilitation of the diversion weirs on the two rivers would probably\nhave a negative impact on the migratory fish population during the dry season. To mitigate that\nimpact, a fish pass structure will be constructed at the Stung Chinit weir with a minimum slope\nthat would allow the fish to migrate upstream.\n84. The use of pesticides in the project area is of concern not only because of the health of\nthe farmers in the area who work the fields and consume the rice but also for the impact on\nwater quality, on fish in rice paddies and downstream, and on livestock and waterfowl. The\nProject will address this issue in the agriculture extension subcomponent, by training WUGs and\nestablishing farmer field schools, and with technical assistance from CARDI. Water quality will\nbe monitored throughout the project period to establish a baseline and to assess the efficacy of\nIPM measures.", "22\n2. Beneficiary Participation in Project Design and Implementation\n85. A social assessment carried out in 1997 included numerous focus group discussions\nand workshops that elicited farmer views of the Project. The workshops revealed a general\nconsensus that the Project should proceed as rapidly as possible, a willingness to contribute to\nproject implementation and irrigation system maintenance, and a willingness to donate strips of\nland where necessary for tertiary canals and drains. Extensive household surveys conducted\nduring the preparation of the Resettlement Plan (RP) in March 2000, and a socioeconomic\nupdate prepared by AFD in March-April 2000, confirmed these findings. Project implementation\nrelies heavily on beneficiary participation. Designs for secondary canals must be confirmed by\nat least two thirds of the farmers, who will be subcontracted for construction through WUGs or\ndirectly by the civil works contractor. Farmers will operate and maintain the irrigation system up\nto the secondary canal headworks, and will hold majority representation on the Stung Chinit\nirrigation committee. Rural roads will be selected through a bottom-up approach that focuses on\nmaximizing cost-effective positive impact for the greatest number of people, and constructed\nusing the LBAT model, which will generate a large demand for local labor.\n86. The beneficiary population includes a high percentage of households headed by women\nand may include some households where the primary income earner is disabled. To address\nthe concerns of women and vulnerable groups, special efforts will be made during the early\nphases of farmer mobilization to ensure full participation in all project activities, including WUGs,\nWUCs, farmer field schools, land titling activities, and system operations.\n3. Social Impacts and Resettlement\n87. Preliminary canal design work indicates that about 110 ha of Government-owned land\ncurrently  used  for  recession  rice  (rice  planted  as  floodwaters  recede,  but  without  formal\nirrigation) will be inundated once the weirs are repaired. The size of the inundation zone will\ndecline steadily from the end of the rainy season through the dry season, allowing some\nhouseholds to continue recession rice agriculture, but delayed by one or two months. The\nprimary users of the land come from a nearby village of 73 households. Farmers estimate yields\non these sandy soils to be less than 1 t/ha. Although no settlements will be flooded and no\nphysical relocation of households is required, people currently using lands that will become\npermanently inundated will receive compensation, preferably in the form of alternate land for\nagriculture,  and  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.  Impacts  from  canal  rehabilitation  are\nexpected  to  be  minor  because  the  rights-of-way  are  already  established,  except  for  22\nhouseholds located on the eastern bank of the main canal, near the Stung Chinit weir. These\nhouseholds will be relocated to an area near the Stung Chinit river to preserve their primary\neconomic  activity  of  bamboo  collection  upstream.  Rural  roads,  which  will  use  existing\nalignments, and markets, which will be built on existing market land or unoccupied public land\ndonated by the district or commune authorities, are not expected to have adverse impacts.\n88. Although the exact limits of inundation and potential land acquisition for expanded canal\nrights-of-way will not be known until the detailed design phase of the Project, ADB assisted the\nGovernment\u2019s Interministerial Resettlement Committee (IRC) with the preparation of a draft\nresettlement plan based on a full census of households that will likely be affected. The draft RP\nwas prepared in accordance ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (November 1995) and\nthe Handbook on Resettlement: a Guide to Good Practice.  Where  there  are  differences\nbetween Government procedures and ADB\u2019s requirements, the latter will govern. The draft RP\nincludes an entitlement matrix, an indicative budget, indicative figures on the number of persons\nnegatively  affected  by  the  Project,  consultative  mechanisms,  grievance  procedures,", "23\nimplementation procedures, and details for external monitoring and evaluation of resettlement\nand compensation. The draft RP will be updated to include any additional negatively affected\nhouseholds  identified  during  detailed  design.  An  independent  agency  acceptable  to  ADB,\ntogether with district-level stakeholder groups, will monitor and evaluate implementation of the\nRP.\n89. Compensation and resettlement activities associated with the RP will be coordinated at\nthe national level by the IRC. The IRC will be chaired by MEF, and will include the governor or\ndeputy  governor  of  Kompong  Thom,  the  national  project  director  of  PMO-MOWRAM,\nrepresentatives of other provincial authorities and ministries as appropriate, and representatives\nfrom the affected districts and communes as members. Detailed implementation of the RP will\nbe conducted by the Stung Chinit resettlement subcommittee (SCRS), convened by the IRC\nand chaired by the deputy governor. The draft RP is presented in Appendix 10.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Economic Analysis\n90. The  Project  was  formulated  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  development  priority  of\nreducing poverty through growth of the rural economy, which is dominated by agriculture. Lack\nof irrigation is but one of many constraints to agricultural productivity. Cambodia in general and\nthe  project area  in particular, also  suffer from  extremely  poor  transportation  links,  lack  of\nknowledge about preharvest and postharvest improved agricultural techniques and technology,\nand inadequate marketing links. For these reasons, the Project includes substantial investments\nin rural roads, agricultural extension services, and markets in addition to irrigation infrastructure.\nThe Project also provides training for Government staff in irrigation design, construction, and\nmanagement, as well as agronomy, to ensure transfer of technology and know-how. Because of\nthe important role to be played by farmers in regular O&M of the system, and current lack of\nexperience in cooperative water resource management, substantial resources are allocated for\nfarmer mobilization and training.\n91. In combination, these investments are expected to increase agricultural productivity,\nreduce farming  costs, and  stimulate  the  rural  economy.  It  is  probable  that  during  project\nimplementation, the skills developed therein will be used to improve the operation of other\nMOWRAM irrigation systems elsewhere  in Kompong  Thom or  nearby.   However, benefits\nresulting from the improved operation of these systems have not been included in this economic\nanalysis.\n92. The economic analysis is based on a comparison of with- and without-Project scenarios.\nSeparate analyses were conducted for part A and part B, and for the Project as a whole. The\ncost and benefits streams were estimated for a 20-year period, including 6 years of Project\nimplementation.  Economic  prices  for  the  main  traded  inputs  are  based  on  World  Bank\ncommodity price projections, and a standard conversion factor of 0.90 was used to estimate\neconomic values for nontraded goods.\n93. The main benefits accruing from irrigation and agricultural extension include incremental\nrice production, yields of other crops and paddy fish. Road improvement benefits are estimated\nusing two conservative methodologies: vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings and increased\nagricultural producer surpluses (APS). VOC savings result from improved road surfaces leading\nto less wear and tear on vehicles, and indirectly from reduced charges associated with higher\nvehicle utilization rates (due to reduced journey times) and less expensive modes of transport.", "24\nAPS benefits result from the removal of physical constraints to the transport of bulky items such\nas fertilizer, and from improved seed and surplus crop production. Care has been taken to avoid\ndouble counting of agricultural benefits from roads and irrigation.\n94. Market  improvement  and  the  landownership  survey  and  titling  subcomponent  are\nexpected to yield major benefits that have not been quantified. Consultants implementing the\nRIIP in Cambodia estimate that postharvest quality improvements resulting from better market\nfacilities amount to 2-5 percent of the value of the crop.19\n95. The economic costs of part A \u2013 the three components directly concerned with irrigation \u2013\nare combined with the economic value of incremental agricultural production to produce a net\neconomic cash flow over 20 years, yielding an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 15.0\npercent. The net cash flow for rural infrastructure yields an EIRR of 32.4 percent, which is\nconsistent with that in other ADB-funded rural road projects. The combined Project EIRR is 19.1\npercent.\n96. The results of the economic analysis are summarized in Table 3, and full details are\npresented in Appendix 11.\nTable 3: Summary of Sensitivity Tests and Switching Values\nEIRR (percent)\nSwitching Value at 12%\nCost Benefit Combined\nBase Discount Rate\nIncrease Reduction Costs +10%\nCase Benefits\n+ 10% - 20 % Benefits \u201320%\nActivity Costs (%) (%)\nOverall 19.1 17.2 17.0 15.2\nIrrigation & Ag. 15.0 13.6 13.4 12.1 27 (20)\nExtension\nRural 32.4 29.1 28.8 25.7 94 (47)\nInfrastructure\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return.\nB. Social Dimensions and Impact on Poverty\n97. The project beneficiaries will include farmers with land in the irrigation command area,\nand people living and working within the areas of influence of the project roads and markets.\nThere is compelling evidence that the majority of the beneficiaries are poor by Cambodian\nstandards. The 1993-1994 Socioeconomic Survey of Cambodia (SESC) provides baseline data\nto measure poverty in the early years following the end of the major civil turmoil. The data reveal\nthat poverty in rural areas was highest, at 40 percent of the population. Even more striking, 46\npercent of the poor are in households headed by farmers, and 75 percent are in households\ninvolved  in  some  type  of  agricultural  activity.20  The  more  recent  1997  Cambodia  Socio-\nEconomic Survey (CSES) reveals almost no improvement in the rural areas: the incidence of\npoverty declined marginally to 39 percent, and rural households still accounted for nearly 90\n                                               \n19    I.T. Transport Ltd. 2000. Market Rehabilitation Sub-Projects: Screening, Selection and Appraisal. Phnom Penh.\n20  Prescott, N. and M. Pradhan. 1997. A Poverty Profile for Cambodia. World Bank Discussion Paper No. 373.\nWashington: The World Bank.", "25\npercent of Cambodia\u2019s poor in absolute terms. These statistics are based on a poverty line of\nabout $0.41 per person per day, which is considered the bare minimum to meet daily caloric\nrequirements plus a nonfood allowance, and is well below the $1 per day standard used by the\nWorld  Bank and  UN for  international  comparisons.  The  1997  CSES  also  reveals growing\ninequality in the distribution of income per capita, with urban areas benefiting more than rural\nareas from economic growth. For example, the rural contribution to the overall poverty gap has\nincreased from 85 to 88 percent, and to the poverty severity index from 83 to 89 percent,\ncompared with the 1993-94 survey.21 Although province-specific data is not readily available,\nthe 1999 Cambodia Human Development Report notes that the poorest villages in the 1997\nCSES are located along Tonle Sap, an area that includes the Stung Chinit system and environs.\n98.  AFD\u2019s recent socioeconomic update in the project area provides a much more focused\npicture of the beneficiaries. AFD found that average household income is at the poverty line,\nand 60 percent of households surveyed reported income below the poverty line. More than one\nthird of the households surveyed are in debt from the previous year, and half of them borrowed\nmoney to cover food shortages or pay for basic medical care. Food deficits typically occur in\nSeptember and November when paddy stocks are depleted before the next harvest.\n99. The link between poverty and access to water resources is well established. In Kompong\nThom, lack of irrigation is a key factor in areas of chronic food insecurity. Farmers will not risk\ninvestments in better agricultural technology without reliable water supplies, and so remain\nvulnerable as subsistence producers. Irrigation will provide an opportunity for higher yields in\nthe wet season and opportunities for cultivation of a second wet season rice crop, new dry\nseason crops including vegetables and legumes, and higher fish yields in paddy areas. By\nassisting farmers to obtain legal title to their land, the Project will also provide a major incentive\nfor investments in agricultural productivity. Household margins from agriculture are expected to\nincrease accordingly, by $84-$350 per year depending on cropping intensity and access to\nyear-round irrigation. This represents an increase in annual income of 10-40 percent for the\naverage household surveyed by AFD, and should elevate a substantial proportion of the poor\nabove the national poverty line. Apart from income, higher yields of rice, other crops, and fish\nwill improve food security and increase average caloric intake. Early impacts will be captured by\nthe socioeconomic surveys planned for the midterm and at the conclusion of the Project.\n100. Benefits from roads and market improvement include lower transport costs; enhanced\naccess  to  agricultural  extension,  health,  and  education  services;  lower  prices  for  input\npurchases and higher prices for produce sales; and improved access to agricultural inputs. This\nwill directly increase household incomes and reduce the incidence of poverty. The construction\nand  rehabilitation  of  irrigation  works,  roads,  and  markets  will  provide  substantial  direct\nemployment (about 400,000 person-days at $1 per day) for people living in the project area. A\nsurvey of ILO\u2019s ongoing rural road project in Siem Reap Province found that road rehabilitation\nresulted in a doubling of travel trips, 43 percent reduction in travel times, 103 percent increase\nin loads carried, 38 percent reduction in passenger fares, and 600 percent increase in the\nnumber of local market shops.\nC. Risks\n101. Even with unfavorable changes in costs and benefits, the economic returns to the rural\ninfrastructure component are robust. The major risks associated with rural roads is inadequate\nmaintenance. MRD fully understands the importance of careful maintenance planning, and is\n                                               \n21  Ministry of Planning. 1997. A Poverty Profile of Cambodia \u2013 1997. Phnom Penh.", "26\ncommitted to raising resources through users at the commune or village level, and through labor\ncontributions. The WFP will assist in this regard through their food-for-work initiative already in\nplace in Kompong Thom. It must be noted, however, that although road user committees are\nincluded in MRD\u2019s new policy on rural roads, they have not been tried in practice, and this\nstrategy must be viewed as a pilot test in the project area. Two political initiatives planned for\n2001 should facilitate the local government\u2019s ability to raise and allocate resources: commune\nelections  and  the  Government  decentralization  of  financial  management  and  development\nplanning through the UN-supported Seila (foundation stone) program. In addition, the project\ndesign requires the Government to shoulder a substantial share of maintenance expenditures\nduring the investment period, while ADB has strong leverage. Future ADB investments in rural\nroads should also be conditional on the Government\u2019s performance on maintenance in the\nProject.\n102. There is also a risk that inadequate maintenance of irrigation infrastructure will reverse\nthe growth in crop yields as water supplies become less reliable. Success requires active\nbeneficiary  participation  to  reduce  the financial  burden on  the  Government.  Therefore  the\nProject allocates substantial resources to early and sustained investments in human capital.\nThe economic returns to the irrigation components remain acceptable at 12.1 percent in the\nevent of a 20 percent reduction in expected benefits and a 10 percent increase in costs. A two-\nyear delay in benefits reduces the EIRR of this component from 15 to 12 percent. The Project\nfaces  a  risk  of  delayed  benefits\u2014directly  through  slow  uptake  of  improved  agricultural\ntechnology and water management, and indirectly through implementation delays. To ensure\nthat  farmers  are  able  to  benefit  quickly  from  irrigation,  the  Project  includes  substantial\ninvestments for agricultural extension and will work closely with established agencies that have\nconsiderable experience in Cambodian rice farming systems, including IRRI, AusAID, CARDI,\nand AFD.\n103. A common cause of implementation delays in Cambodia is lack of qualified trained\ncounterpart staff with experience in aid-funded projects. This should not present a serious\nproblem  for  the  Project,  as  both  MRD  and  MOWRAM  have  given  generally  satisfactory\nperformance in implementing ADB projects. The Project will also benefit from two new ADB-\nfinanced TAs: Capacity Building in the Ministry of Water Resources, and Strengthening External\nAid Portfolio Management,22 which will provide assistance in project and financial management\nto all EAs of ADB-financed projects. Provincial Implementing Agencies also have worked with\nbilateral sources: PDWRAM is receiving training and material resources from the World Bank,\nOTEE is working with AusAID to refine and expand its agricultural extension services, and\nPDRD is working with KfW and WFP to build roads, and with GTZ on a provincial development\nproject.\n104. Rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure and rural roads will increase land values in the\narea.  The  situation  can  lead  to  alienation  of  the  original  inhabitants  by  powerful  and\nunscrupulous interests. Although most of the inhabitants in the project area hold some type of\ndocumentation for their land issued by communal authorities, few have formal titles. For this\nreason, the Project includes a land registration and titling component that will commence at the\noutset  of  project  implementation.  The  component  also  includes  counseling  and  a  public\nawareness campaign to educate current landowners about their rights and possible remedies in\nthe event that their holdings are threatened.\n                                               \n22  TA 3287-CAM: Strengthening External Aide Portfolio Management, for $900,000, approved on 2 November\n1999.", "27\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n105. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated into the legal documents:\n(i)  Prior  to  30  June  2002,  MOWRAM  will  establish  the  Stung  Chinit  irrigation\ncommittee (SCIC).  At least 50 percent of the SCIC members, including the\nchairperson, will be elected representatives from the WUCs in the project area.\nAt least 20 percent of seats on the SCIC will be reserved for women. By 30 June\n2003, MOWRAM will have completed construction of a building as headquarters\nfor the SCIC.\n(ii)  All  environmental  mitigation  measures  set  out  in  the  SIEE  report  will  be\nincorporated in the project design and implemented: (a) the construction and\ntesting of a fish pass structure on the Stung Chinit diversion weir, (b) periodic\nwater  quality  monitoring,  and  (c)  inclusion  of  IPM  techniques  and  safety\nprograms  on  pesticides  and  fertilizers  as  integral  parts  of  farmer  training\nprograms under the Project.\n(iii)  All people affected by the Project because of either loss of  land or  loss  of\nlivelihood will be compensated in a timely manner in accordance with the ADB\nHandbook on Resettlement  and  compensation  measures  set  out  in  the  RP\nagreed  upon  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  Upon  completion  of  the\ndetailed design of the irrigation infrastructure works, but prior to the start of\nconstruction for such works, the  Interministerial  Resettlement  Committee  will\nsubmit to ADB for approval an updated RP that identifies any other negatively\naffected persons in addition to those households already identified. The updated\nRP will be prepared in consultation with the affected persons and will specify the\ndetailed  compensation  measures  applicable  for  all  affected  people.  An\nindependent,  qualified  agency  acceptable  to  ADB  will  monitor  and  evaluate\nimplementation  of  the  RP.  Stakeholder  monitoring  groups  including  affected\npeople will be established in each district to participate in the monitoring and\nevaluation process.\n(iv)  By  January  2002,  the  Department  of  Cadastre  and  Geography  will  have\ncompleted a survey of ownership in respect of all land in the project area, and\nprepared and publicly posted cadastral index maps in all villages in the project\narea. By June 2002, the technical inspection of all undisputed parcels will have\nbeen completed for the adjudication record.\n(v)  The secondary canals and offtakes and tertiary block boundaries will be prepared\nin consultation with the farmers affected by such design. The overall design of\nthe irrigation structure will be completed only after at least two thirds of the\nfarmers  along  each  secondary  canal  have  approved  the  designs  for  the\nsecondary canals and offtakes and tertiary block boundaries.\n(vi)  Public markets will be constructed only on existing market sites or public land\nthat is not occupied or used otherwise by private persons. In selecting roads and\nmarkets for upgrading, the Government will take into account the views of target", "28\nbeneficiaries through surveys and meetings at the village, commune, and district\nlevels.\n(vii)  MOWRAM and MRD will ensure that maintenance plans are prepared for rural\nroads and the main irrigation canal and control structures on the basis of physical\nmeasurements of needs  and  agreed-upon  maintenance  standards.  MEF  will\nensure that the budget will fund the full cost of the maintenance activities after\nproject  completion.  The  Government  will  apply  the  system  and  financing\narrangements  for  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  of  rural  roads  to  be\ndeveloped under the ADB-financed RIIP.\n(viii)  The Government will ensure that O&M of the irrigation system will be carried out\nin accordance with the principles of its Implementation Policy for Sustainable\nIrrigation Systems, and will consult ADB on any adjustments of this policy for the\nproject area.\n(ix)  Before implementation of any market upgrading activities, a market committee for\nthe market concerned will be established and market user fees determined. The\ncomposition of the market committee, its terms of office, and the market user\nfees will need approval from the Provincial Rural Development Committee. The\nmarket committees will be responsible for O&M of market facilities,  and  will\nfinance these activities with market user fees.\nB. Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n106. Prior to loan effectiveness, the following will be completed:\n(i)  AFD will have approved the provision of the AFD grant.\n(ii)  The Government will have approved a Resettlement Plan, satisfactory to ADB,\nand established the Stung Chinit resettlement subcommittee.\n(iii)  Project  implementation  units  for  each  part  of  the  Project  will  have  been\nestablished and project managers appointed.\nVII.

Introduction\n1. This appendix presents the Summary Initial Environmental Examination (SIEE) of activities\nprescribed under the Stung Chinit Water Irrigation and Rural Infrastructure Project. It identifies\npotential  environmental  impacts  of  the  Project  and  recommends  mitigation  and  monitoring\nmeasures during implementation.\n2. This SIEE is based on information provided in the final Environmental Impact Assessment\nof the Stung Chinit Water Resources Development Project,1 two follow-up fisheries studies, field\nvisits, and a detailed census of households that may be negatively affected. It follows the IEE\nprocedures set out in the Environmental Guidelines for Selected Agricultural and Natural Resources\nDevelopment Projects, Environmental Assessment Requirements,  and Environmental Review\nProcedures of ADB.\nB. Description of the Project\n3. The Project is an integrated rural development project with substantial investments in water\nresources development, rehabilitation of rural roads and markets, training of farmers for long term\nmanagement of the irrigation scheme and development of farmer water user groups to ensure\nsustainability of the project.\n4. The Project has a broad and multisectoral approach to stimulate the rural economy and\nincludes components for (i) farmer organization, training, and extension services, (ii) rehabilitating\nand upgrading irrigation infrastructure; (iii) developing farmers\u2019 irrigation management skills and\noperation and maintenance (O&M) systems; and (iv) upgrading rural infrastructure such as markets\nand farm-to-market roads.\n5. The  Project  will  be  one  of  the  larger  irrigation  development  projects  undertaken  in\nCambodia in recent times.  Monitoring the progress and its implementation will give us information\non the development process, the process of capacity building and training of local staff, monitoring\nthe effects of the project on the project area and on the surrounding area. It will also assist in\nbuilding  the  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of Water  Resources  and  Meteorology  (MOWRAM),  the\nExecuting Agency, should a second phase be considered.\n6. The project was initially assigned environment category A because of the inclusion of a\ndam and reservoir, but was reclassified as category B with the deletion of the dam component.\n7. The Project covers a gross area of about 10,000 hectares (ha) in Kompong Thom, about\n150 kilometers (km) north of Phnom Penh on the eastern edge of the Great Lake (Tonle Sap). The\nprovince is one of the poorest in Cambodia and, due to its location on the frontline of an internal\nsecurity conflict, has missed out on even the modest growth that has occurred in other parts of the\ncountry in the past decade. The province has few natural resources upon which to base economic\nand social development. Much of the population is made up of subsistence or semisubsistence rice\nfarmers, dependent on one low-yielding wet season rice crop per year, with diet and income\nsupplemented by capture fisheries and some livestock production. In the wet season, because of\nthe wet climate and low-lying terrain, few crops other than rain-fed rice can be grown. In the dry\n                                               \n1 The Environmental Impact Assessment completed in December 1997 was based on the original project concept that\nincluded a storage dam and reservoir in addition to the rehabilitation of the irrigation system.", "47\nAppendix 9, page 2\nseason the situation is even more intractable.  Without irrigation nothing can be grown, and most of\nthe agricultural areas lie fallow. Irrigation can dramatically change the situation, by permitting\nmultiple rice crops. In addition, providing irrigation opens the possibility of growing higher value\ncrops and will encourage rice farmers to invest in improved rice production technologies. Thus,\nharnessing the waters of the Stung Chinit and its tributary, the Stung Tang Krasang, will stimulate\nthe rural economy and increase incomes for one of the poorer sections of the country\u2019s population.\nC. Description of the Environment\n8. During the Pol Pot regime in the mid-1970s, many diversion weirs, irrigation canals, and\nwater control structures were built. Many of the structures were poorly planned and designed and\ndid much damage to the rice ecosystem of ancient Cambodia. The structures on the Stung Chinit\nand Stung Tang Krasang are an exception, and functioned for a period from 1978 to 1989, when a\nlarge flood forced the Government to breach the embankment south of the weir to protect it from\ncollapse.\n1. Physical Resources\n9. The Stung Chinit project area is located in the central province of Kompong Thom. The\nproposed command area is  predominantly a  savanna floodplain,  comprising  the  northeastern\nfringe of the Tonle Sap floodplain at an altitude of 10-20 meters (m), while the river\u2019s headwaters\nreach altitudes of 100 m. A few scattered hills are found in the catchment area.\n10. Kompong Thom experiences a typical monsoon climate with the major proportion of rainfall\nduring the warmer months of May through October. Rainfall varies between 1,750 and 2,000\nmillimeters, the higher figure attained in the upper catchment area. The prevailing pattern in the\nStung Chinit area is that the majority of rainfall events are short storms of high intensity lasting from\n1 to 3 hours, which take place over a very small area. The Stung Chinit is one of the tributaries of\nthe Tonle Sap River, and has a total catchment area of some 4,2000 square kilometers (km2)\n(measured up to the Stung Chinit diversion weir). Downstream of the command area, the Stung\nChinit forms an extensive floodplain-cum-delta system with numerous creeks, braided waterways,\nand permanent waterbodies such as oxbows and marshes. The highest reported flooding events\nreported by farmers in the project area occurred in 1931, 1942, 1944, 1953, 1979, and 1994.\nLonger duration typhoons during the southwest monsoon caused most of these flooding events\nalthough the largest flood was caused by the northeast monsoon. The 1 in 100 year and the 1 in\n10,000  year  floods  flowing  into  Stung  Chinit  upstream  of  the  Bangki  Tanggren  have  been\nestimated at 2,400 and 10,000 cubic meters/second, respectively.\n11. It is estimated that the specific yield of groundwater in the area is small and is assumed to\nrange from 15 to 50 cubic meters (m\u00b3)/day/m. For the area, the yield of the aquifer was calculated\nat 360-800 m\u00b3/day/km\u00b2, depending on the radius of influence. A second estimation was made by\nusing the water balance model for the area, which yielded 1.4 million cubic meters/year/km\u00b2,\nequivalent to 380 m\u00b3/day/km\u00b2.  Therefore, prospects of irrigation from groundwater resources are\nlimited although it is expected that recharge and yields would increase with the rehabilitation of the\nirrigation system in the area. Many households have private wells, especially along the main road,\nbut few are equipped with pumps. Groundwater-based irrigation during the dry season from high-\nyield wells does not seem to have much scope.\n12. The  Tonle  Sap  is  Asia\u2019s  largest  freshwater  lake  and  is  of  outstanding  international\nimportance for its rich natural resources. The lake has been under consideration for UNESCO\ndesignation as a World Heritage Site. The lake acts as a storage basin\u2014or outlet\u2014for the Mekong\nRiver during the monsoon season. By mid-June, the Mekong water level rises faster than the Tonle", "48\nAppendix 9, page 3\nSap, the drainage capacity of numerous outlets of the Mekong\u2019s deltaic system to the South China\nSea cannot keep up with the sheer volume of water flowing in the Mekong River, and water is\npushed westward through the 120 km long Tonle Sap River into the lake  and  its  tributaries\n(including the Stung Chinit), thereby increasing the lake area sixfold. By the end of October, the\nflow into Tonle Sap reverses and the lake again drains into the Mekong. The inundated forests of\nthe floodplains of the Tonle Sap serve as key spawning grounds and nursery for most freshwater\nfishes. The high organic content of Tonle Sap\u2019s floodplain further supports fish expansion and is a\nkey factor in the inherent productivity of the country\u2019s inland fisheries. Over 200 fish species have\nbeen recorded in the Tonle Sap area including the giant Mekong catfish, which weighs up to 100\nkilograms.\n2. Ecological Resources\na. Flora of Stung Chinit Catchment and Command Area\n13. Partly because of the long period of political instability and insecurity of the remote forested\nareas, much of the upper reaches of the Stung Chinit have retained their natural forest cover. The\nStung Chinit catchment area comprises one of the last remaining stands of dry evergreen lowland\nforests in the Indo-Chinese subregion, which encompasses Viet Nam, Lao People's Democratic\nRepublic, and the eastern parts of Thailand.\n14. Most of the upper catchment area (2,528 km2 or 84 percent) consists of dipterocarp forest.\nSome 336 km2 (or 11.1 percent) of the Stung Chinit catchment area constitutes a patchwork of\nforest of different levels of disturbance. Patches along the lower sections of the Stung Chinit\ncatchment area have been logged and treated so heavily that few large trees remain. It is assumed\nthat most logging has been carried out by the various communities of the Stung Chinit prior to their\nevacuation in the late 1970s. Some 48 km2 (or 1.6 percent) of the Stung Chinit catchment area is\nmade up of former farmland and landholdings currently in use.\nb. Fauna\n15. Common wildlife species recorded in the upper catchment area of the Stung Chinit include\npig-tailed macaque (Macaque nemestrina), long-tailed macaque (Macaque fascicularis), and leaf\nmonkey (Presbytis cristata). Mouse deer (Tragulus spp.), civet and mongoose species (Fam.\nViverridae and Herpestidae), fishing cat (Prionailurus viverrinus), and wild boar (Sus scrofa) are\nconsidered still common in the upper stretches of the watershed. Otters (Lutra/Lutragale spp.) are\nreported to inhabit the Stung Chinit River and tributaries. In the proposed command area, species\ndiversity has greatly been reduced and only the more common (opportunistic) species still occur in\nsmall numbers, like rodents, bats, and mongooses. None of these species are endemic to the\nregion or restricted to the command area.\n16. Stung Chinit is part of the important fishery resource of Tonle Sap. The species diversity of\nthe Tonle Sap and its tributaries is high, with 215 species recorded to date. Most fish species of\nStung Chinit occur throughout the Mekong\u2019s lower reaches, and Stung Chinit is therefore unlikely\nto hold a large number of endemic species.\n3. Human and Economic Resources\n17. In 1995 the population of Kompong Thom totaled 542,573. Of these 280,510 were women.\nThe 1994 population growth rate was estimated at 2.92 percent per year, which would cause the\npopulation to double within the next 25 years. The province comprises an area of 13,000 km2,\ndivided into 8 districts, 81 communes, and 720 villages.", "49\nAppendix 9, page 4\n18. The number of villages within or near the proposed project area proper is 80. In this area,\nthere are 71,609 potential beneficiaries, of which 37,251 are women (52 percent). There are an\nestimated 12,500 rural households. The major economic activity of the project area is agriculture,\ncharacterized primarily by paddy cultivation during the wet season and supplemented by  the\nproduction of livestock and an array of fisheries culture and capture activities. These activities\noccur both in the project area itself and on the nearby fringes of Tonle Sap. To the east of the\nproject area some remaining forest areas also provide supplementary incomes from firewood\ngathering, hunting, and collecting wild forest products.\n19. Over the last two years, four companies have been granted logging concessions covering\n82 percent of the Stung Chinit catchment area. A combination of stagnant regional economic\ngrowth and new logging fees have brought most logging operations to a standstill. On the basis of\na  recent  review  of  concessionaire  performance  conducted  with  assistance  from  ADB,2  the\nGovernment has chosen  to  cancel  some of  the  existing  concessions  and  revise  concession\nagreements to better protect the forest. In the future, logging activities in the upstream catchment\nwill need to be closely monitored.\n4. Quality of Life Values\n20. To enhance the quality of life for rural Cambodians\u2014who have already suffered from more\nthan  two  decades  of  civil  war\u2014-it  will  be  necessary  to  move  away  from  subsistence-based\nagriculture. The districts of Baray and Santuk in the command area of the proposed rehabilitation\nproject contain a substantial number of rural households that are already involved in market-\noriented forms of agricultural development. If these households had access to irrigation water\nduring the dry season and better forms of water management during the wet season, they could\nincrease their household incomes. This will have a multiplier effect for other households, as more\nlocal agricultural wage labor opportunities become available with intensification and diversification\nof local agriculture.\n21. Although provincial statistical data are generally considered to be unreliable, it provides a\nfirst indication of the incidence of waterborne diseases. The most common diseases in Kompong\nThom are malaria, dengue fever, typhoid, and respiratory infections (including tuberculosis).  Both\ndengue fever and malaria occur in the command area. Malaria is found to occur naturally. Annual\nparasitic incidence (API) is high, with high malaria potential, and moderate to high incidence rates.\nOther  waterborne  diseases  prevalent  in  the  command  area  are  cholera,  gastroenteritis,  and\nhepatitis. Schistosomiasis and filariasis are absent.  Hookworm is prevalent among the population.\n22. As the Project will stimulate agricultural development, water resources are likely to become\nexposed to more agricultural waste and pollutants, as wastewater treatment facilities are not\navailable. Polluted water in general could have serious impacts on public health and is a leading\ncause of high morbidity and mortality rates in rural communities. The main sources for drinking\nwater for the communities of the command area are rivers and private wells.  The  provincial\nDepartment of Hydrology with assistance from a Christian NGO, Adventist Development and Relief\nAgency (ADRA), has constructed a number of public drinking wells in Kompong Thom.\n23. Undernutrition remains an issue for deprived communities far away from Highway No. 6\nand who are cut off from mainstream economic developments. A Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische\nZusammenarbeit (GTZ) nutrition baseline survey carried out in March/April 1997 in the districts of\n                                               \n2  TA 3152-CAM: Sustainable Forest Management, for $980,000, approved on 31 December 1998.", "50\nAppendix 9, page 5\nStong, Stungsen, and Santuk found a high prevalence of undernutrition (49.3 percent) in children\nunder five years of age, which could be attributed to long-term chronic food shortage.\nD. Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1. Migratory Fish Population\n24. Rehabilitation  of  the  Stung  Chinit  diversion  weir  and  restoration  of  the  breached\nembankment will negatively impact the migratory fish populations of the Chinit by blocking one of\nthe migratory pathways to historical spawning grounds. The Stung Tang Krasang diversion weir\nhas blocked the main upstream wet-season spawning migration in that river ever since it was\nconstructed in 1978, although migration through the Stung Chinit and via the main canal to the\nupper Stung Tang Krasang is possible and documented. The Stung Chinit diversion weir was\nclosed almost continuously from 1977 to 1989, and blocked fish migrations through the main\nchannel during that time. A migratory route was reestablished following the breaching of the\nembankment in 1989 to protect the weir superstructure from further damage. It is not known what\nimpact the 12-year weir closure had on migratory fish populations, but anecdotal evidence and\nobservation suggest that a significant migration still takes place in the Chinit today.\n25. The most promising mitigation measure for the migratory fish population is to install a fish\npass on the Stung Chinit diversion weir during the rehabilitation phase of the Project. The current\nstructure at the weir includes a navigation lock on which a fish pass can be constructed.  With the\ncorrect design, this will permit a share of the migratory fish populations to pass the weir and give\nthem access to historical spawning grounds in the upstream areas of the Stung Chinit and Stung\nTang Krasang. Due to the superstructure design, a fish pass is considered less likely to be\nsuccessful at the Stung Tang Krasang diversion weir, and the one at the Stung Chinit Diversion\nWeir will serve both river systems. This is borne out by the current situation \u2013 the Stung Tang\nKrasang weir is jammed shut, but fish are migrating above the weir through the main canal that\nconnects both rivers. If the fish pass at the Stung Chinit diversion weir does operate effectively,\nand future monitoring suggests that the Stung Tang Krasang would benefit from its own fish pass\nat the weir, one can be designed at a later stage based on the results of the Stung Chinit model.\n26. The recommended design will be based on an existing model at the Ben Anderson Barrage\non the Burnett River, Australia. Without detailed knowledge of operational water levels above and\nbelow the Chinit diversion, the length of the structure, and hence the number of cells, cannot be\nestimated until the detailed design stage. Because the fish pass will be the first of its kind to be\nbuilt in Southeast Asia, there exists an excellent opportunity to carry out original research that may\nbe of tremendous value to other projects in the future. A research proposal for the fish pass at the\nStung  Chinit  diversion  weir  is  included  as  a  supplementary  appendix.  The  Mekong  River\nCommission and the Cambodian Department of Fisheries will collaborate with the Project on this\nresearch component.\n2. Minimum Dry Season Flow\n27. To maintain the full health and integrity of downstream aquatic habitats, the entire normal\ndry-season flow is required. Clearly, this will not be available. Fish and many other forms of aquatic\nlife are at their most vulnerable during the dry-season months because environmental conditions\nare usually most harsh during this period. Food is often scarce, levels of predation are highest,\nwater temperatures usually peak during the hot season and, subsequently, oxygen often falls to its\nlowest level. All these factors stress fish, rendering them susceptible to disease and mortality.", "51\nAppendix 9, page 6\n28. In the absence of quantitative studies, minimum environmental flow releases of at least 10\npercent of the mean monthly flow have been recommended to maintain healthy aquatic habitats in\nEurope, North America, and Australia. Given the diverse nature of tropical fish faunas, and the\ngenerally higher water temperatures, the figure 10 percent of mean monthly flow may not be\nsufficient for the Stung Chinit. But much of the water diverted from the river channel will be\ndistributed into the same area through paddy, secondary and tertiary canals, and drains, and some\nwill return to the river course through this system. The species of fish common to the area do not\nnaturally spend most of their lifetime in the river system, but rather move throughout the landscape\nwhere water is available. Farmers interviewed during the feasibility study noted that paddy fish\nyields improved when the system was functioning in the 1980s.\n29. Every  attempt  should  be  made  to  gather  pre-impoundment  data  on  physical  and\nhydrological characteristics below the weir during the design phase of the Project, and to maintain\nthese as much as possible without unduly compromising the irrigation function of the weir. These\nactivities are included in the fisheries research component described in a supplementary appendix.\n3. Increased Use of Agrochemicals\n30. With the increase in rice and/or other cash crop cultivation, use of agrochemicals will\nincrease and may create problems related to residual toxicity and nutrient enrichment of water in\nthe command area. Use of pesticides in the area is currently negligible except for farmers growing\ncash crops in the dry season. But through the drainage system of the rehabilitated irrigation\nsystem, chemicals could affect wetlands surrounding the villages up to the ecologically important\nTonle Sap and floodplain. Although there is a time lag between the beginning of irrigation and the\nobservance of water quality deterioration (increased pollutants), the agricultural effects are already\nbeing observed for such aspects as nitrates as water hyacinth is already seen in the command\narea.  Lab facilities  to  analyze pesticides  residues  in  water  samples  are  not  yet  available  in\nCambodia, but analyses could be carried out in neighboring countries such as Thailand and Viet\nNam.\n31. A recent study3 showed that most pesticides available in Cambodia are of questionable\nquality. Most pesticides are not labeled in Khmer and sellers and farmers have no way of knowing\nthe expiry date of most of the available pesticides. Two popular pesticides  sold  and used\u2014\nmevinphos and methyl-parathion\u2014are in the World Health Organisation (WHO) Hazard Class I,\ni.e., the most toxic of pesticides. In October 1998, the Cambodian Government passed the Sub-\ndecree  of  Standard  Agricultural  Materials  and  Equipment  Management,  a  law  that  includes\npesticide regulation. This is the first law to deal with pesticides in Cambodia. It regulates the import,\nsale, labeling, packaging, quality, storage, disposal, and marketing of pesticides in Cambodia.\nSince the passage of the legislation, however, not much has been done to implement it.\n32. The lethal effects of pesticides are rarely restricted to the species for which the chemical is\napplied. Most have a broad-spectrum impact that causes incidental damage to a wide array of\nwildlife, plant life, and water organisms. Pesticides also represent a major occupational health risk\nfor farmers and their families.  A WHO report (1990) revealed that occupational pesticide poisoning\nmay affect some 3 percent of the farmers in developing countries every year. Accurate data for the\ncommand area is not available. Medical staffs in Baray and Santuk Districts are not trained in\nidentifying or treating pesticides poisoning cases, and lack diagnostic equipment and antidotes.\nPesticide-related health problems stem largely from improper handling, application (mixing and\nspraying chemical cocktails), and storage practices. WHO strongly recommends that Category I\npesticides should be used only by trained personnel. Field surveys for this assessment revealed\n                                               \n3 Jahn, G. 1999. The Cambodia-IRRI-Australia Project 1998 Annual Technical Report (CIAP).", "52\nAppendix 9, page 7\nthat the present use of pesticides is limited to periods when pest outbreaks occur. This may reflect\nthe poor socioeconomic conditions prevailing rather than the seriousness of pest attacks. Many\nfarmers do not strictly follow the application prescriptions, spraying either less than prescribed\ndoses (to reduce cost) or up to 2 times higher during pest outbreaks. Most farmers do not use\nsprayers, but flick the pesticide over their fields using bamboo brushes.\n33. Excessive  use of chemical fertilizers  will  result  in enrichment  of  water  bodies  due  to\nnitrogen and phosphorus runoff. Loading of water bodies (rivers, oxbows, ponds, and marshes) by\nthese chemicals could cause eutrophication, which in turn will give rise to prolific aquatic plant\ngrowth, especially of algae. Aquatic weed growth can cause a drop in dissolved oxygen content\nand impact aquatic life, including fish.\n34. To mitigate the impact of increased agrochemical use, the Project will develop farm safety\ntraining programs on integrated pest  management  (IPM)  as  part of the  agriculture extension\nservices envisioned for the project, and through farmer field schools modules on the appropriate\nuse of pesticides and fertilizers.\n35. Another mitigation measure is to develop and implement systematic monitoring programs\nfor  agrochemicals  residues  in  wetland  ecosystems  and  poisoning  cases.  Water  quality  at\nappropriately  chosen  sites  will  be  monitored  to  measure  changes  in  physicochemical  levels,\nincluding buildup of pesticides residues. The Mekong River Commission will undertake this work on\nbehalf of MOWRAM and prepare annual reports that identify negative impacts and recommend\nmeasures for water quality improvement. Future water quality standards for various uses, as\ndefined by the Ministry of Environment should be adhered to.\n4. Increase in Hookworm Incidence\n36. With the irrigation project, more standing water will be available and for longer periods\nduring the year. There is a possibility of increased incidences of hookworm in the population\nserved by the Project. Hookworms cause chronic blood loss from the intestine and predisposes the\nvictim to the development of iron deficiency anemia, sometimes of great severity, which constitutes\na  major  public  health  problem.  Their  harmful  effects  are  often  aggravated  by  coexistent\nmalnutrition or micronutrient deficiencies. The presence of hookworms reduces the productivity of\nthe population.\n37. According to the WHO office in Phnom Penh, a simple dose of mebendazol tablet will not\nonly have a significant impact on the overall health of the population but also improve their overall\nproductivity. Given the low cost of the tablet, $0.02 each, distribution of this medication is well\nwithin the means of a host of nongovernment organizations and international organizations that are\nfocusing on health issues in Cambodia. In the farmer field schools and during extension activities,\nthe Project should ensure that farmers are educated on the health risks of hookworm and seek\npartner organizations to provide mebendazol in the project area.\nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Mechanism\n38. The potential impacts described above require careful monitoring of water quality and\nfisheries health. MOWRAM does not presently have the capacity to undertake such research.\nInstead the Mekong River Commission together with the Department of Fisheries will implement a\nmonitoring program that includes annual water quality testing and periodic fish stock and migration\nassessments. The work will begin with establishment of environmental baseline data on water\nquality and annual fish migrations, and then use repeat samplings over the life of the Project to", "53\nAppendix 9, page 8\ndetermine Project impacts as early as possible. Annual research reports will highlight problem\nareas and recommend further mitigation measures as necessary.\nF.  Conclusions\n39. The Project is expected to improve the quality of life for the population served by increasing\ntheir income and providing better food security. With the mitigation measures as recommended,\nthe Project would have no significant adverse environmental impact.", "54\nAppendix 10, page 1\nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN\nA. Introduction\n1. This summary draws on the draft Resettlement Plan (RP) prepared by the Government with\nassistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The RP was developed from preliminary\ndesigns, and will need to be updated during the detailed design phase in the early stages of project\nimplementation  to  ensure  that  all  negatively  affected  persons  (APs)  are  accounted  for  and\ncompensated in accordance with ADB requirements. A loan covenant makes commencement of\ncivil works conditional on satisfactory updating of the RP.\nB. Negative Impacts\n2. The main components of the project that will result in land acquisition are reconstruction of\nweirs  that  will  increase  flood-prone  areas,  renovation  of  canal  banks,  and  rehabilitation  of\nsecondary canals and drains that have fallen into disrepair.\n1. Residential Structures\n3. Twenty-two households (86 APs) residing on the main canal bank will be required to\nrelocate. The houses are made of bamboo and thatch. The primary economic occupation of these\nhouseholds is collection of bamboo from upstream areas and sale of bamboo products, and\nfishing. These households will need to be relocated to an area close to the Stung Chinit river to\nprotect their sources of livelihood.\n2. Loss of Productive Land\n4. It  is  expected  that  water  impounded  by  the  restored  Stung  Chinit  diversion  weir  will\ninundate some lands upriver that are currently used for agricultural purposes. According to a\ncensus of the area completed during preparation of the RP, some of the 70 households in village\nTaphok may be affected by loss of land in the flood-prone area. A preliminary hydrological study\nindicates that at maximum flood, some 110 hectares (ha) would be inundated temporarily, and up\nto 30 ha permanently. This area was inundated seasonally from 1977 to 1989, when the irrigation\nsystem still functioned. The collapse of the system permitted local households to expand recession\nrice to some areas closer to the river bottom. Interviews with farmers indicate that when the system\nwas functioning, it was still possible to plant rice in much of the inundated area because the water\nlevel was 30 centimeters or less. The exact nature of the impact cannot be determined until the\ndetailed design phase of the Project, but it is encouraging that Taphok remained in its current\nlocation throughout the period when the scheme functioned, and supported roughly the same\nnumber of families.\n5. During restoration of the secondary canals and drains, some households may lose narrow\nstrips of agricultural land along canal alignments. Focus group discussions and consultations\nindicated that households are willing to give up to 2-meter strips of land voluntarily. Furthermore,\nhouseholds with lands along the canals are expected to be the major project beneficiaries. The\nproject design also requires that two thirds of the farmers agree on the design for secondary canals\nprior to commencement of civil works.\nC. Consultations, Census, and Baseline Survey\n6. During preparation of the RP, focus discussions with potential APs were conducted in five\nvillages to inform stakeholders of the Project\u2019s objectives and likely impacts. Following focus", "55\nAppendix 10, page 2\ndiscussions, the village leaders participated in an information campaign to describe the planned\ncensus and baseline survey and inform the target villages of the schedule for consultations. During\nthe survey, APs were given detailed information on the Project, the objectives of the survey, the\ngeneral provisions of ADB\u2019s resettlement policy, and resettlement/compensation options. Based on\nthe preliminary design, the census and social survey covered 91 percent of affected households.\nExcept for the 22 families residing on the canal banks, all other families are engaged in farming\nactivities. Secondary occupations are fishing and wage labor. Thirty-six households surveyed earn\nless than KR50,000 and are below the poverty line. The balance earn between KR50,000 and\nKR100,000, and only 2 households earn more than this in a year. The majority of the households\nhave only verbal permission to cultivate the land, and although no formal titles exist for the land in\nthe area, the Government claims right of ownership. The Government recognizes that regardless\nof legal status, negatively affected farmers are entitled to compensation.\nD. Updating and Revisions in the RP\n7. During the design phase of the Project, technical specifications for the diversion weir and\nmain  canal  and  detailed  hydrological  investigations  will  permit  a  more  accurate  estimate  of\ninundated areas and APs upstream of the weir. At this stage it will also be possible to determine if\nany secondary canal or drain restoration will result in further APs. Thus at the end of 2001, the\nGovernment will review the original census data, update information on land use by the affected\nhouseholds,  and  identify  any  other  households  further  upstream  that  may  be  affected.  The\nGovernment will submit the revised and updated RP to ADB for approval prior to commencement\nof civil works.\nE. Legal and Policy Framework\n8. At present there is no legally documented resettlement policy in Cambodia. Resettlement\nwill be guided by ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995).\nF. Entitlements\n9. Attempts will be made during the detailed design to avoid or minimize adverse social\nimpacts. Vulnerable groups will be given special assistance to deal with adverse impacts and\nassisted to benefit from the project, by participating in small civil works. The UN World Food\nProgramme will participate to target vulnerable groups and provide rice and cash payments for\npiecework. Farming households will be entitled to participate in the agricultural extension services\npackage under the Project. Severely affected vulnerable households will be entitled to agriculture\ninputs to the value of $200 per household.\n10. Compensation  will  be  at  replacement  value  for  lost  assets.  Transportation  and  a\nsubsistence allowance will be paid to cover for any loss of income during the resettling period. A\ntransport allowance of a maximum estimated $40 per household or assistance in kind would be\nprovided. The subsistence allowance is estimated at $50 per household. Loss of land will be\ncompensated with similar productive land, if available, or compensated at market prices, currently\nestimated at $2,000/ha. All unit prices for compensation will be reviewed and updated prior to\npayment of compensation.\n11. The  cost  of  compensation  and  resettlement  activities  is  estimated  at  about  $370,000\nequivalent. This includes contingencies for up to 75 additional households and 80 ha of land in the\nevent that more APs are identified based on detailed design.", "56\nAppendix 10, page 3\nG. Implementation Arrangements and Grievance Redress\n12. The Government has established an Interministerial Resettlement Committee (IRC) chaired\nby the Ministry of Economy and Finance to take overall responsibility for resettlement in aid-funded\nprojects.  To  handle  day-to-day  implementation  matters,  IRC  will  establish  the  Stung  Chinit\nResettlement Subcommittee (SCRS) that will include the governor or deputy governor of Kompong\nThom Province, an appointed IRC member, representatives from the Ministry of Water Resources\nand Meteorology Project Implementation Unit (PIU), and other relevant provincial departments and\nat least four representatives of the APs. AP representation may be revised upward once the total\nnumber  of  APs  is  finalized  during  detailed  design.  Stakeholder  monitoring  groups  will  be\nestablished at the village level.\n13. A  grievance  committee  will  be  established  within  the  SCRS  and  will  include  AP\nrepresentatives  as  well  as  representatives  from  an  independent  nongovernment  organization\nengaged to monitor RP implementation (see below). Members of the PIU will be assigned to assist\nthe SCRS on the technical aspects of resettlement arising from planned civil works, scheduling of\nactivities, and coordination.\nH. Independent Monitoring\n14. IRC will engage an independent agency to carry out monitoring and evaluation of the RP.\nThe objectives and the terms of reference will be prepared by IRC and reviewed by ADB. AP\nrepresentatives  will  work  with  the  independent  agency  to  ensure  participatory  monitoring.\nGrievance may also be expressed to the independent agency and the concerns raised will be\nincluded in the monitoring report. The agency will submit quarterly reports to IRC and ADB directly.\nSix months after the completion of resettlement activities, the monitoring agency will submit an\nevaluation report to ADB and IRC.\nI. Implementation schedule\n15. Resettlement activities will commence at the earliest in year 2002. Once the detailed design\nis complete and a revised plan is submitted, IRC will provide an updated implementation schedule\nthat indicates resettlement activities as they relate to the civil works.", " 57\nAppendix 11, page 1\nFINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES\nA. Introduction\n1. The Stung Chinit irrigation system was built in the late 1970s by the Khmer Rouge regime\nusing largely forced labor. The system was designed to provide supplemental wet season irrigation\nover the maximum possible command area of 12,000 hectares (ha) using run-of-the-river flows, but\nwith little regard for economic viability. Although there are few records, local farmers recall that the\nscheme  operated  more or  less  continuously  until  the  late 1980s,  when the  main  canal  was\nintentionally breached to protect the Stung Chinit diversion weir during a major flood. Since then\nmany of the canals have silted up, none of the major control structures are functioning, and service\nroads are largely impassable in the wet season. Agriculture continues in the area, but at a low\nintensity. Farmers rely on one rain-fed rice crop per year, fisheries associated with wet season\npaddy, and livestock including some cattle, pigs, chickens, and ducks.\n2. The first Asian Development Bank (ADB)-assisted feasibility study to assess development\noptions for the Stung Chinit, conducted in 1997, concluded that maximum benefits would be\nobtained by the construction of a dam upstream that would allow year-round irrigation over the full\n12,000  ha  command  area.  However,  the  Government  and  ADB  subsequently  agreed  that\nproceeding  with  the  full  dam  option  would  be  too  ambitious  at  this  stage,  in  view  of  the\nGovernment's limited implementation capacity, farmers\u2019 lack of experience with fully irrigated rice\nproduction, and uncertainty about environmental impacts. It was therefore agreed that a two-stage\napproach should be adopted in developing the area. The first stage will be limited to areas close to\nthe main canal that can be irrigated using run-of-the-river flows. A subsequent feasibility study\nestimated these areas at 7,000 ha, comprising 5,000 ha to receive supplemental wet season\nirrigation and 2,000 ha to receive year-round irrigation.\n3. Irrigation,  though  crucial,  is  but  one  of  many  constraints  to  agricultural  productivity.\nCambodia  in  general  and  the  project  area  in  particular,  also  suffer  from  extremely  poor\ntransportation links, lack of knowledge about preharvest and postharvest improved agricultural\ntechniques  and  technology,  and  inadequate  marketing  links.  For  these  reasons,  the  Project\nincludes substantial investments in rural roads, agricultural extension services, and markets. The\nProject  also  provides  Government  staff  with  training  in  irrigation  design,  construction  and\nmanagement, as well as agronomy, to ensure transfer of technology and know-how. Because of\nthe important role to be played by farmers in regular operation and maintenance of the scheme,\nand current lack of experience in cooperative water resource management, substantial resources\nare allocated for farmer mobilization and training.\n4. In combination, these investments are expected to increase agricultural productivity, reduce\nfarming costs, and stimulate the rural economy. It is probable that during project implementation\nthe opportunity will be taken to use skills developed therein to improve the operation of other\nirrigation schemes elsewhere in Kompong Thom Province or nearby provinces.  However, benefits\nresulting from the improved operation of these schemes  were not  included  in  this  economic\nanalysis.\nB.  Assumptions on Project Costs\n5. The costs were prepared according to standard ADB guidelines using COSTAB software.\nThe costs were based either on local prices prevailing in the project area in late 1999 or in dollar\nterms inflated from previous studies at a rate of 3 percent per year.  An exchange rate of KR3,800\nper dollar was used where applicable. Physical contingencies were estimated for individual items", "58\nAppendix 11, page 2\nat rates shown in the detailed cost tables. Physical contingencies are based on Mission estimates,\nthe Cambodian Rural Infrastructure Improvement Project (RIIP),1 and the recent International Fund\nfor  Agricultural  Development  appraisal  of  the  Agricultural  Development  Support  to  Seila\n(foundation stone) Project. International price contingencies were calculated according to ADB\u2019s\nestimates of international price inflation, currently 2.4 percent per year. Local inflation had been\nrunning at rates of up to 18 percent annually in recent years but, as a result of political changes\nand improved economic policies, fell to about 4 percent by the end of 1999. An inflation rate of 6\npercent was applied to local costs, as specified in the ADB guidelines for Cambodia. Taxes and\nduties have been applied at rates supplied by the Cambodian Ministry of Finance.\nC. Expected Impact of the Main Components\n1.  Irrigated Agriculture Development (Part A)\na.  Agriculture\n6. The  proposed  project  area  totals  about  7,000  ha  that,  following  the  collapse  or  de-\ncommissioning of the irrigation system structures, is currently cropped with only wet season rain-\nfed rice. The exact extent of the cropped area will be established during the detailed design phase.\nYields are currently low by international standards at 1.2\u20131.4 tons per hectare (t/ha). Without the\nProject, per hectare yields are expected to rise from an average of 1.3 to 2.3 t/ha over a 20-year\nperiod as a result of the gradual adoption of improved technologies\u2014which is already taking place\nin Cambodia\u2014and improved marketing and road communication in the Kompong Thom area,\nwhich until recently has been virtually inaccessible.\n7. With the Project, assuring supplies of supplementary irrigation water and introduction of\nimproved technologies are expected to raise wet season yields from the initial 1.3 t/ha up to 3.0\nt/ha, generally exceeding the without-project situation by 0.7 t/ha.  It is anticipated that the 7,000 ha\nwill be improved over a period of three years by 2,000, 2,000, and 3,000 ha per year, and with the\nfirst significant increase in yield occurring in the year 2005.  Furthermore, and based on recent\nexperiences in other improved irrigation schemes in Cambodia, the provision of supplementary\nirrigation in the wet season together with agricultural extension and improved rice varieties will\nallow about 40 percent of farmers to double-crop their land, growing one short-duration rice crop\nfollowed by another longer duration crop.\n8. The rehabilitation of the weirs and associated irrigation works will also allow the reliable\nirrigation of about 2,000 ha in the dry season. Production on this land in the dry season is currently\nnegligible and will remain so in the without-project situation. With irrigation, yields on this area are\nexpected to increase over a four-year period from 2.5 to 4.0 t/ha, and it is anticipated that it will\ntake two years to bring the full area into production. Again following the experience of other\nimproved  irrigation  schemes  in  Cambodia,  farmers  are  expected  to  diversify  away  from  rice\nproduction into other cash crops on about 25 percent of the dry season irrigated area of 2,000 ha.\nThe cropping intensity on the balance of the 1,500 ha, which is solely planted to rice, is expected to\naverage 90 percent in the dry season.\n9. The difference between the with- and without-project situations is expected to stabilize after\n20 years, after which time yields will have reached their steady-state levels. In total, the Project is\nexpected to lead to a sustainable increase in rice production of about 16,300 t of rice and about\n950 t of other crops per year.\n                                               \n1  Loan 1385-CAM: Rural Infrastructure Improvement, for $25.1 million, approved on 28 September 1995.", "59\nAppendix 11, page 3\nb. Fisheries\n10. Fish production in paddy fields is already a common practice in the project area, but yields\nare limited by the occurrence of drought periods during the wet season. During the socio-economic\ninvestigations undertaken as part of the project preparatory technical assistance, farmers reacted\npositively  to  the  idea  of  supplementary  irrigation,  especially  since  it  would  make  their  fish\nproduction more reliable and profitable. However, fish production on irrigated land in the dry\nseason  is  a  more  problematic  concept  in  that  the  proposed  high-yielding  varieties  require\napplications  of  pesticides,  which  may  reduce  paddy  fish  productivity.  On  average,  and  after\ndiscussions with local farmers, the increase in fish production resulting from the rehabilitation of the\nirrigation scheme was estimated at about 15 kg per ha per year, valued at about KR5,000 per kg,\nor a total of about $20 per ha per year over the 7,000 ha. These benefits will accrue as each wet\nseason block is sequentially rehabilitated.\n2. Rural Infrastructure (Part B)\n11. ADB  has  established  through  a  number  of  projects,  especially  in  Bangladesh2  and\nCambodia (the RIIP), that the provision or improvement of rural roads and markets leads to definite\nand sustainable benefits. These include lower transport costs, enhanced access to agricultural\nextension, health and education services, lower prices for purchases and higher prices for sales of\nproduce, improved access to agricultural inputs, the opportunity to diversify into higher value crops\nsuch as vegetables, increased availability of raw materials for nonagricultural industries, a wider\nmarket for crops and other locally produced goods, reduced levels of spoilage, and increased\neconomic opportunities such as repair shops, roadside cafes, and fuel sales associated  with\nimprovements in transport. A further direct benefit is the employment created by the use of labor-\nintensive construction technology \u2013 completing 1 km of road is estimated to generate about 2,000\ndays of employment.\n12. Because some of the preceding benefits are difficult to quantify or forecast, ADB has\nadopted two conservative methods of assessing benefits: vehicle operating cost (VOC) savings\nand the stimulation of agricultural producer surpluses (APS). VOC savings result from the direct\nreduction in costs as a result of less wear and tear on vehicles following an improvement in road\nsurface conditions, a drop in prices charged when vehicle utilization rates can be increased as a\nresult of a reduction in journey times, and changes to less expensive modes of transport. APS\nbenefits result from the removal of physical constraints to the transport of bulky items such as\nfertilizer, improved seed and surplus crop production as well as from crop diversification. The\ncalculation of the benefits accruing to the 150 km of roads to be rehabilitated under the Project is\ndiscussed below.\n13. Direct benefits have not been attributed to the associated refurbishing of six rural markets\nsince these benefits are difficult to quantify precisely. However, the consultants implementing the\nRIIP  derived  an  estimate3  of  postharvest  quality  improvements  resulting  from  better  market\nfacilities valued at 2-5 percent of the value of the crop. The average agricultural turnover of 12\nmarkets investigated by the consultants was about $685,000.\n                                               \n2  For example, see PCR: BAN 21086: Rural Infrastructure Development Project, June 1999.\n3  I.T. Transport Ltd. 2000. Market Rehabilitation Sub-Projects: Screening, Selection and Appraisal. Phnom Penh,\nFebruary 2000.", "  60\nAppendix 11, page 4\na. VOC Benefits\n14. The RIIP based its estimates of VOC savings on a study undertaken on stretches of roads\nrehabilitated by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in Battambang Province. Battambang\nis more remote and less developed than Kompong Thom. The project area is directly adjacent to a\nrecently renovated national highway, and is only two hours from Phnom Penh, therefore this ILO\nestimate is inherently conservative. The costs were inflated by 20 percent, using the increase in\nthe price of labor from KR2,500 per day to KR3,000 per day from the time of the survey until now\nas a proxy for the general increase in costs.\n15. According to the survey estimate, before roads were rehabilitated an average of about 780\nvehicles of various types, mostly bicycles or motorcycles, traveled along a typical kilometer length\nat a weighted average VOC of KR210 per vehicle per kilometer. After rehabilitation, the traffic\ncount rapidly increased to about 1,400 vehicles per day, at an average VOC of KR150 per vehicle\nper  kilometer.  The  economic  analysis  does  not  include  cost  savings  for  incremental  traffic\ngenerated by road rehabilitation, to avoid double counting of benefits attributed to APS (paras. 16-\n18). Thus, the VOC saving can be estimated at 600X(210-150) = KR36,000 or about $9.45 per\nkilometer per day.  This equates to a total VOC saving of US$ 3,356 per kilometer per year. As in\nthe RIIP, it was assumed that these savings will take two years to reach their full levels.\nb.  APS Benefits\n16. Previous ADB studies have referred to research work in Bangladesh and elsewhere, which\ndemonstrated that improving rural roads stimulates agricultural production on each side of the\nrehabilitated road and generates APS. The width of the corridor is generally at least 2 km on each\nside of the road. About 150 km of road will be rehabilitated under the proposed component, of\nwhich about 50 km pass directly through the Stung Chinit irrigation scheme. No APS benefits have\nbeen attributed directly to those 50 km of road since increased production along and near these\nroads has been assumed to come from the rehabilitation of the irrigation scheme and the provision\nof irrigation water.\n17. Of  the  remaining  100  km,  about  80  percent  is  assumed  to  pass  through  productive\nagricultural areas, the remainder being occupied by villages and fishponds or is used for other\npurposes or is idle. The net length of road for which APS benefits can be claimed and the\nassociated benefit corridor are presented in Table A11.1.\nTable A11.1: Road Lengths and Corridors for APS Benefits\nNet Road Length Benefit Corridor\nYear\n(km) (ha)\n2001 10 4,000\n2002  30 12,000\n2003 30 12,000\n2004 10 4,000\nAPS = agricultural producer surplus.\n18. It was noted above that, even without the Project, per hectare yields are expected to rise\nfrom 1.3 to 2.3 t/ha over the 7,000 ha over a 20-year period as a result of the gradual adoption of\nimproved technologies and improved marketing and road communication. The APS impact of\nimproving roads under the rural infrastructure component has been assumed to speed up this\nprocess by about five years over the amount of time that it would otherwise have taken. Thus, in", " 61\nAppendix 11, page 5\nthe  calculation of APS  benefits  the  without-Project  increase  in per hectare  gross  margins  is\naccelerated by five years and multiplied by the area of the benefit corridor.\nC. Financial Farm Analyses\n19. Four simplified farm models were prepared to assess the Project impact on a typical farm\nfamily in the area. The average farm size was 1 ha. No account was taken of changes in the\nproduction of other  crops  within the  homestead  plot,  of  fish  production,  or  of  other  off-farm\nincomes, since it had been assumed that those enterprises would not be directly affected by the\nProject. The four models refer to\n\u2022  the present without-Project situation;\n\u2022  the future without-Project situation in the year 2020;\n\u2022  the  future  with-Project  situation  in  the  year  2020  on  the  7,000  ha  provided  with\nsupplementary irrigation in the wet season; and\n\u2022  the future with-Project situation in the year 2020 on the 2,000 ha provided with irrigation\nwater in the dry season.\n20. The calculated financial gross margins per hectare in the various situations, based on the\nprice of rice in the project area, about KR450 per kg or $118 per mt, are presented in Table A11.2.\nTable A11.2: Gross Margins\n($)\nGross Margin\nSituation Gross Margin (per family\n(per hectare) person-day)\nWithout Project \u2013 2001 114 0.95\nWithout Project \u2013 2020 153 1.28\nWet Season Irrigation\u2013 2020 237 1.98\nDry Season Irrigation \u2013 2020 266 2.21\nBoth Wet Season and Dry Season \u2013 2020 503 2.10\n21. By the year 2020, the provision of supplementary wet season irrigation should raise the\naverage family\u2019s income by a minimum of $84 per year, earning an additional $0.70 per family\nperson-day.  Dry season irrigation only would raise it by $113 per year or $0.93 per family person-\nday. Those families cropping in both wet and dry seasons could expect an increase of $350 per\nyear, or $0.82 per family person-day. This analysis assumes quite slow adoption of technologies\nand  techniques to  improve  yields. A  parallel  study  by  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement\nestimated annual incremental household returns to cropping in the wet and dry season at $236.\nThe analysis assumed lower cropping intensities, and assumed these benefits are available by\nyear 6 of the Project. The use of irrigation to allow cropping in both the wet and dry seasons is thus\nan effective way of sustainably and significantly raising family incomes. The analysis is inherently\nconservative because  it does not  attempt to  capture  the  impact  of  improved  post-harvesting\npractices on rice quality and price, though provision is made for training in this area as part of\nagricultural extension services under Part A.", " 62\nAppendix 11, page 6\nD. Economic Analysis\n1.  Introduction\n22. The economic analysis was carried out separately for both of the major components and for\nthe Project as a whole in accordance with standard ADB procedures. Economic prices for the main\ntraded inputs and outputs, which are mainly rice and fertilizer, are based on the latest World Bank\ncommodity price projections for the year 2005, adjusted to constant 1999 values using the G-5\nmanufacturers' unit value index. Rice is freely traded from Cambodia across the borders to both\nThailand and Viet Nam and in both directions depending on the time of year. Rice is commonly\nexported from Cambodia after the wet season harvest as farmers have to accept low prices to\nclear their debts and to purchase various goods, but rice is later imported again to Cambodia\nduring the lean period before the next harvest. The price used in the analyses is thus the arithmetic\naverage of the import- and export-parity prices. This situation is expected to continue in the\nmedium-term future as increases in Cambodian rice production are offset by population growth.\nRice has initially been priced at a 15 percent quality discount over the value of Thai 5 percent\nbroken rice. However, given the large local and regional market for rice and the gradual nationwide\nimprovements in communications and marketing information, it is expected that producers with\naccess to reliable supplies of irrigation water will respond to quality price differentials and (i) 10\nyears from now will be receiving prices discounted by only 10 percent from the Thai indicator price,\nand (ii) within 15 years will be receiving prices discounted by only 5 percent.\n23. Fertilizer prices were estimated at import-parity levels, reflecting the likely ongoing need for\nCambodia to import fertilizer.  Border prices were adjusted to farmgate prices by allowing for the\neconomic values of transport, processing, and marketing. The prices of nontraded goods were also\nadjusted by a standard conversion factor of 0.9 in accordance with ADB\u2019s current practice for\nprojects in Cambodia; hired farm labor was shadow-priced at 75 percent of its market value.\n2.  Irrigated Agriculture Development (Part A)\n24. The  volumes  of  incremental  production  and  input  use  have  been  multiplied  by  their\neconomic prices to derive the economic net value of incremental production, and combined with\nthe economic costs of the three components directly concerned with irrigation to derive a net\neconomic cash flow for the irrigation components. The resulting economic internal rate of return for\nPart A is 15.0 percent.\n3.  Providing Rural Infrastructure (Part B)\n25. The EIRR for this component is based on the estimated VOC and APS benefits accruing to\nthe rehabilitation of the rural roads; benefits from the improvement of the six selected village\nmarkets were not included. The calculated EIRR for this component is 32.4 percent.\n4. Whole Project EIRR and Sensitivity Tests\n26. Combining the net cash flow streams for both Parts A and B yields a project EIRR of 19.1\npercent. Table A11.4 presents a resource statement with the major cost and benefit streams and\ncalculation of EIRR by component and for the entire Project. A number of sensitivity tests were\ncarried out to test the EIRRs under a range of assumptions. The results of the sensitivity tests are\npresented in Table A11.3. It is encouraging that the irrigation infrastructure component yields an\nestimated  EIRR  of 15  percent.  The  EIRR  of  this  component  remains  above  the  12  percent\nthreshold despite a 10 percent cost increase and 20 percent reduction in benefits. The risk of a", "  63\nAppendix 11, page 7\ncost increase beyond current estimates is low: the estimates are intentionally conservative, with\ngenerous contingencies, to ensure adequate funds are available despite possible economic shocks\nduring the life of the Project.\n27. The EIRR for rural infrastructure proves even more robust when costs rise and benefits fall\nby  10  percent.  APS  benefits  claimed  from  the  rural  infrastructure  component  may  prove\nconservative because the corridor of influence is assumed to be only 2 km on each side of the\nroad, whereas experience in other countries has demonstrated that it may often reach up to 5 km\non each side of a rehabilitated road.\nTable A11.3: Summary of Sensitivity Tests and Switching Values\nEIRR (percent)\nSwitching Value at 12%\nCost Benefit Combined\nBase Discount Rate (%)\nIncrease Reduction Costs +10%\nCase\n+ 10% - 20 % Benefits -20%\nActivity Costs Benefits\nOverall 19.1 17.2 17.0 15.2\nIrrigation & Ag.

Although not presented in the table above, sensitivity tests were also conducted on the\ntiming of benefit flows in Part A. If the benefits from irrigated agriculture accrue two years faster\nthan expected, the return to Part A increases to more than 21 percent. A corresponding delay in\nthe accrual of benefits drives the EIRR down to 12 percent. It was not considered necessary to test\nfor the impact of delayed benefits for the rural infrastructure component since road benefits are\nknown to accrue almost immediately after the investments have been made, and Ministry of Rural\nDevelopment's ongoing experience in road building under RIIP makes construction delays unlikely.", "Table A11.4: Resource Statement and Calculation of EIRR\n(Unit: $'000)\nComponent 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2010 2015 2020\nPart A: Irrigated Agriculture Development\nBenefits\nRice           -           -           -           -          626       1,283       2,220       2,312       2,442\nOther Crops           -           -           -           -            99          197          197          197          197\nFish           -           -           -           -            40            80          140          140          140\nCosts\nFarmer Community Org. and Extension          392          340          312          317          214          176\nIrrigation and Drainage Infrastructure          862       1,144       2,825       2,592       1,112          206          218          218          218\nIrrigation System Management            61           -          203          207          198          104\nNet Cash Flow      (1,315)      (1,485)      (3,341)      (3,116)         (758)       1,075       2,339       2,430       2,561\n \n6\nEIRR (%) for Irrigation 15.0 4\nPart B: Rural Infrastructure\nBenefits\nVehicle Operating Costs           -            30          136          287          408          453          453          453          453\nAgriculture Producer Surplus           -            70          293          614          898       1,029       1,400          977          273\nCosts\n150 km rural roads          700          971          984          721          290          299          299          299          299\nNet Cash Flow         (700)         (870)         (555)          180       1,015       1,183       1,554       1,131          427 A\np\nEIRR (%) for Supporting Infrastructure         32.4 p\ne\nn\nd\nWhole Project ix\n 1\n1\nNet Cash Flow      (2,015)      (2,355)      (3,896)      (2,936)          257       2,258       3,893       3,561       2,989 , p\na\nEIRR (%)         19.1 g\ne\n 8\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:191000815173719", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Creator": "PSCRIPT.DRV Version 4.0", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R162-00RRP.doc", "ModDate": "D:20000907151153"}}
