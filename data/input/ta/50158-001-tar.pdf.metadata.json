INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  global  development  community  adopted  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals \n(SDGs) in 2015, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has a responsibility to support its \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) in implementing them.1 Compared with the Millennium \nDevelopment  Goals  (MDGs),  most  SDGs  have  environmental  sustainability  underpinnings. \nSDGs 12, 13, 14, and 15 directly relate to the environment, as do others (including 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, \n9, and 11) through the interactions of natural and social systems.2 DMCs will need support to \nimplement environment-related SDGs, which may be overlooked in national development plans \ncompared with other SDGs, as happened under the MDGs. Capacities of DMCs will have to be \nstrengthened  to  integrate  these  SDGs  into  national  policies,  plans,  and  programs  and  to \naddress  implementation  issues,  such  as  strengthening  statistics;  developing  partnerships; \nfinancing; and harnessing science, technology, and innovation.3  \n \n2.  The capacity development technical assistance (TA) is consistent with Strategy 2020, its \nmidterm review, and the Environment Operational Directions.4 ADB is preparing Strategy 2030, \nits long-term strategy leading to 2030. The TA will potentially contribute to aligning the new ADB \nstrategy with environment-related SDGs. Demand for the TA has been confirmed with DMC \nofficials as well as with the regional departments that were consulted to identify regional priority \nenvironmental challenges that could be addressed through the environment-related SDGs, and \npotential pilot DMCs.5 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.6  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Implementation of environment-related SDGs will be critical for continued development \nin the region. Environmental degradation and climate change threaten development gains, with \nthe poor suffering most. At the third Asia-Pacific Forum on Sustainable Development in April \n2016, which initiated a regional dialogue on implementing Agenda 2030, participants identified \nenvironmental challenges to be prioritized in the region, including degradation of ecosystems, \nunsustainable resource use, air and water pollution, and threats posed by climate change and \nnatural disasters. In providing DMCs support to implement environment-related SDGs, policy \nand institutional coherence, data monitoring, and accountability will need to be addressed at the \n                                                 \n1  United Nations. Sustainable Development Summit 2015. https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/summit. \nThe SDGs were adopted as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which calls for a new approach \nto development to eradicate poverty; reduce inequalities; and promote inclusiveness, environmental sustainability, \nand resilience.  \n2  United  Nations.  Sustainable  Development  Goals.  https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs  SDG  12  on \nResponsible Consumption and Production\u2014Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns; SDG13 on \nClimate Acton\u2014Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts; SDG 14 on Life Below Water\u2014\nConserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources for sustainable development; and SDG 15 \non Life on Land\u2014Protect, restore, and promote the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage \nforests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss.  \n3  Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP). 2016.

DMC participants expressed interest in the \nTA, with some indicating their willingness to be pilot DMCs. \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 September 2016. \n ", "2   \nnational level. For example, governments will need capacity to analyze and evaluate policy \noptions based on environmental as well as economic and social criteria, and to monitor policy \nimpacts  and  progress  against  targets.  Measurement  and  monitoring  for  environmental \nsustainability progress is the weakest among the sustainable development pillars (economic \ndevelopment,  social  development,  and  environmental  protection)  because  of  insufficient \nproduction of environment statistics, impeding DMCs\u2019 ability to determine baseline conditions \nand set targets. Financing is also a concern since, compared with other priorities such as basic \nservices or infrastructure provision, less incentives exist to invest in environmental sustainability, \nas it is often difficult to demonstrate returns on investments.  \n \n4.  DMCs  have  varying  capacities  and  will  have  differing  needs  based  on  national \ncircumstances  and  development  priorities.  Consultations  undertaken  by  the  project  team \nindicate  DMCs  require  capacity  building  support  for  environment-related  SDG  issues  and \naccess to finance. Tools and methodologies to mainstream the SDGs will have to be identified \nand/or  developed  considering  applicability  and  priorities  in  DMCs.  Helping  DMCs  identify \npriorities and set targets for environment-related SDGs will also assist ADB in identifying targets \nunder the forthcoming  Strategy 2030.  Upstream support for environment-related SDGs will \ncreate opportunities to support sector investments in sustainable infrastructure and resource \nconservation (SDG12) and natural resources management (SDGs 14 and 15), including co-\nbenefits in climate change adaptation and mitigation (SDG13).7 The national policies, strategies, \nand programs to be identified by the DMCs as necessary in meeting environment-related SDGs \ncan be areas for follow-on ADB support through policy advice, TA, projects, and knowledge \nservices. \n \n5.  The TA aims to address DMCs\u2019 capacity needs to implement environment-related SDGs. \nUsing the  Mainstreaming,  Acceleration,  and Policy Support  implementation  guidance as a \nframework and guided by DMCs\u2019 priority needs, the TA will (i) conduct a stocktaking and review \nstudy on the integration progress of environment-related SDGs to national policies and plans, \n(ii) develop a set of technical guidance materials  to adapt environment-related SDGs and \ntargets to national and local contexts, (iii) undertake activities\u2014applying the technical guidance \nmaterials\u2014to develop recommendations for integrating environment-related SDGs in national \nplans and policies in three pilot DMCs, and (iv) disseminate lessons on integration and build \nDMCs\u2019 capacities to use the technical guidance materials.8 \n \n6.  The TA is aligned with the Environment Thematic Group\u2019s work program. It will build on \nADB\u2019s previous support for  achieving  MDG7 (environmental sustainability) in  Asia and the \nPacific, and will align with Strategy 2030 (under preparation) to support DMCs in implementing \nactions on the environment-related SDGs. ADB\u2019s support for MDG7 primarily focused on water \nsupply and sanitation, and investments in energy and transport to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions. There was limited focus on forests and protected areas.9 ADB needs to shift to \noperations with more innovation and impact from an environmental perspective. The TA covers \n                                                 \n7  For example, co-benefits of protecting biodiversity and ecosystem services under SDGs 14 and 15 include support \nfor Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation and ecosystem-based adaptation. \n8  The United Nations Development Group has prepared a reference guide (Mainstreaming, Acceleration, and Policy \nSupport) on a common approach to mainstreaming Agenda 2030 and the SDGs that covers eight implementation \nguidance areas: (i) raising public awareness; (ii) applying multi-stakeholder approaches; (iii) tailoring SDGs to \nnational, subnational, and local contexts; (iv) creating horizontal policy coherence (i.e., across sectors); (v) creating \nvertical policy coherence (i.e., from national to local levels); (vi) budgeting for the future; (vii) monitoring, reporting, \nand accountability; and (viii) assessing risks and fostering adaptability. \n9  Independent Evaluation Department. 2013.

ADB.   \n ", "  3 \nsustainable consumption and production, marine ecosystems, and terrestrial ecosystems that, \nother than forests, were not part of the MDGs. The TA will also work with regional partners such \nas Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and United Nations \nEnvironment  Programme  (UNEP),  both  of  which  have  mandates  to  support  countries  to \nimplement the SDGs. The TA will also build on lessons from the Poverty and Environment Fund \nand ongoing participation in the Poverty and Environment Partnership.10 The TA will ensure \nsynergy and avoid duplications with the regional TA on Agenda 2030 and the SDGs, which \ntracks and monitors overall SDG implementation.11 The TA complements the regional TA, as \nboth will help ADB support SDG implementation and develop Strategy 2030, but focuses on \nimplementing environment-related SDGs.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be the integration of environment-related SDGs into policy and planning \nprocesses in Asia and the Pacific DMCs improved or achieved in the longterm. The outcome will \nbe enhanced capacity and knowledge of governments and other stakeholders to implement \nenvironment-related SDGs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  In supporting the integration  of environment-related SDGs,  the TA will identify and \nsupport innovative approaches to implementing these SDGs through two outputs. \n \n9.  Output 1: Regional stocktaking and review, technical guidance materials, and \nknowledge-sharing workshop. The TA will conduct a stocktaking and review of (i) efforts to \nintegrate environment-related SDGs into national and subnational policies, plans, and programs, \nearly  lessons,  and  capacity  needs;  (ii)  regional-  and  country-level  support  activities  by \ndevelopment partners; and (iii) knowledge partnerships. The review will also identify barriers to \nmainstreaming these SDGs in national policies and plans, including (i) alignment with national \npriorities and obligations, where economic- and social-related goals often have greater political \ntraction; and (ii) natural resource management and other relevant regulations, as the majority \nwere developed without sufficient attention to sustainable development.  \n \n10.  In  parallel,  the  TA  will  prepare  an  inventory  of  best  practices,  tools,  and  other \nmechanisms developed by DMCs, development partners, and Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development countries to support environment-related SDGs, and will assess the \napplicability of these tools. Based on inventory and assessment findings, the TA will adopt, \nupdate, or prepare a set of technical guidance materials to integrate these SDGs in national \nplans and policies. The materials, intended for DMC (governments and other stakeholders) use, \nwill have at least three modules on SDGs 12, 14, and 15. The materials will include process \nmaps  that  identify  entry  points  in  the  Mainstreaming,  Acceleration,  and  Policy  Support \n                                                 \n10 The Poverty and Environment Fund supported two regional TA programs: ADB. 2003.

Technical Assistance for Agenda 2030: Supporting the Sustainable Development Goals through \nStrategic Partnerships and Preparedness. Manila (TA 9130-REG). This TA\u2019s main objective is to monitor and \nreport on SDG implementation progress in collaboration with United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \nand ESCAP.  \n ", "4   \nframework for consideration of environmental issues; diagnostic tools to  detect barriers in \nachieving environment-related SDG targets; and methods for integrated approaches and policy \ncoherence  with  related  SDGs,  selection  of  indicators,  policy  design,  and  institutional \narrangements to support SDG implementation.12   \n \n11.  A regional workshop will be held for DMC officials, other stakeholders, and development \npartners to disseminate and validate the review findings, share technical guidance materials, \nand identify priority environment-related targets, capacity needs, and follow-up actions. This \nopportunity will be used to discuss (e.g., from planning, budgeting, and environment ministries) \nopportunities for identifying pilot DMCs and, if possible, secure commitments from DMC officials.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Recommendations for mainstreaming environment-related Sustainable \nDevelopment  Goals  in  three  pilot  developing  member  countries  and  dissemination \nworkshop. Building on output 1, and focusing on environment-related SDGs and DMCs\u2019 priority \ntargets, the TA will undertake activities applying the technical guidance materials in three pilot \nDMCs. Potential pilot DMCs will be identified in consultation with regional departments and/or \ncountry directors and DMCs, and criteria\u2014to be developed under output 1\u2014will be used in \nselection. ADB will help DMCs identify activities for TA support and may, with DMC consent, \nbring  in  other  development  partners  to  support  specific  activities.  Activities  can  include \nconducting  studies,  providing  workshops  or  training  on  integrated  approaches  to  identify \nenvironmental  priorities,  establishing  indicators  on  environmental  issues  (and  determining \nbaseline data needs) against which implementation can be monitored, clarifying synergies and \ntrade-offs, strengthening policy coherence, and improving institutional arrangements.13 \n \n13.   Based  on  the  activities\u2019  outcome,  the  TA  will  assist  DMCs  in  developing \nrecommendations on mainstreaming environment-related SDGs into national policies and plans, \nand a work plan and resource mobilization strategy to implement them. Recommendations may \ninclude  prioritizing  measures,  setting  national  and  subnational  targets,  or  selecting \nenvironmental indicators. A second regional  workshop will be held for DMC officials, other \nstakeholders,  and  development  partners  to  disseminate  technical  guidance  materials, \nknowledge, and lessons. \n \n14.  Focal ministries or agencies (including ministries of environment, planning, and finance \nalongside sector ministries) will be identified based on their role and mandate to support \nenvironment-related SDG activities. Output 2 activities will be implemented in coordination with \ncountry-level SDG mainstreaming activities by United Nations agencies and other development \npartners. A potential risk is that governments may change their priorities or commitments on \nenvironment-related SDGs due to political factors, which would affect their commitment to the \nTA. To minimize this risk, ADB will focus activities on issues and sectors where there is clear \ncommitment in development plans and a definite need for environment-related SDG activities.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.    The TA is estimated to cost $1,150,000 of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The  governments  of  the  three \n                                                 \n12 In addition, the TA will review lessons from ADB\u2019s previous support for achieving the environment MDG, including \nADB\u2019s tripartite partnership with ESCAP and UNDP.  \n13 Integrated approaches could include the integrated landscape approach linking land management practices, \ninstitutions, and policies with other landscape-scale activities, and the nexus approach examining interrelatedness \nand interdependencies of environmental resources in a system (e.g., water\u2013energy\u2013food nexus).  \n ", "  5 \npilot  DMCs  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office \naccommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and other in-\nkind contributions. The TA will not finance any activity in a DMC unless no objection is obtained \nfrom the government of that DMC. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  of  the  TA,  which  will  be  implemented  by  the \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department working through the Environment \nThematic Group. The TA will involve collaboration with regional departments and sector and \nthematic groups  to develop technical guidance materials and implement activities  in three \nDMCs. ADB will work with regional actors (e.g.,  United Nations Development Programme \n[UNDP], UNEP, and ESCAP) and other development partners in TA implementation. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented from  November 2016 to  October 2019. An indicative \nschedule is included in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). The TA will finance \nconsulting services, workshops and capacity development activities, and report preparation. \nIndividual consultants (22 person-months international and 24 person-months national) will be \nrequired. Consultant selection and engagement will be done following ADB's Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Terms of reference are in Appendix \n3. The TA will fund the participation in workshops and conferences of DMC officials, participants \nfrom key institutions, and sector representatives. Disbursements will be made following the \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nProcurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). \n \n18.  Coordination will be undertaken with resident mission in pilot DMCs. It is expected that \nparticipating  DMCs  will  identify  counterpart  staff  to  provide  leadership  and  administrative \nsupport to the implementation of country mainstreaming activities, and  to receive capacity-\nbuilding activities. Given that responsibilities for environment-related SDGs may fall across \nseveral ministries and agencies, counterpart ministries and agencies for pilot activities will be \ncarefully selected in consultation with operational departments, country directors, and DMCs, \nincluding concurrence from finance or planning ministries, as applicable. For TA output delivery, \na potential risk is that DMCs may change personnel assigned to implement activities. The TA \nwill  involve  potential  focal  point  ministries  and  agencies  early  on  and  carefully  review \ninstitutional arrangements for environment-related SDG implementation in each pilot DMC, so \nthat  appropriate  partner  personnel  and  agencies  with  demonstrated  commitment  to  policy \nadherence and dialogue continuity are selected. Coordination among concerned agencies also \nneeds to be managed, given the required multisector approach. \n \n19.  The TA will disseminate knowledge and lessons from  outputs 1 and 2  through the \nsecond regional workshop. ADB will work with development partners including UNDP, UNEP, \nand ESCAP to disseminate the findings more widely. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor Supporting Implementation of Environment-Related Sustainable Development Goals in Asia \nand the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \n \nIntegration of environment-related  SDGs into policy and planning processes in Asia and the Pacific DMCs \na\nimproved  or achieved in the long term (The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development)  \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nCapacity and  a.
