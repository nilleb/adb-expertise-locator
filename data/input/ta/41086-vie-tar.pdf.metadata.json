The Government of Viet Nam has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to enhance absorptive capacity and efficiency in implementing official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA) projects and programs. Although the TA was not included in the \ncountry  strategy  and  program  2007\u201320101 endorsed  by  the  Board  in  October  2006,  the \nGovernment  communicated  the  TA\u2019s  high  priority  to  the  January  2007  Country  Program \nConfirmation Mission.2 The Fact-Finding Mission was conducted in June 2007 and reached an \nunderstanding with the Government on the TA\u2019s impact and outcome, scope, cost and financing, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the consultants. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  recent  socioeconomic  development  has  been  remarkable.  Poverty \ndecreased from 58.1% in 1993 to 18.1% in 2006, and average per capita income increased \nfrom $288 to $712 during the same period.3 Further reduction of poverty incidence to 10%\u201311% \nby 2010 is a goal of the Government\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2006\u20132010.4 This \nplan aims to (i) accelerate and sustain economic growth and development; (ii) significantly \nimprove  people\u2019s  material,  cultural,  and  spiritual  life;  (iii)  create  the  foundations  to  boost \nindustrialization and modernization and gradually develop a knowledge-based economy; and \n(iv) enhance Viet Nam\u2019s status in the region and in the world. \n \n3.  While  committed  national  efforts  have  enhanced  the  country\u2019s  socioeconomic \ndevelopment, various types of ODA from multilateral and bilateral external agencies also made \nsignificant contributions. ODA loans helped to finance key infrastructure, social services, and \nagriculture  development  projects,  while  ODA-financed  TAs  helped  to  introduce  new  skills, \ninternational best practices, and modern technology. ODA commitments over the past 5 years \ntotaled about $11.1 billion. However, only about $7.8 billion was disbursed, substantially less \nthan the target of $9.0 billion.  \n \n4.  As  Viet  Nam  expedites  its  reforms  and  socioeconomic  development  with  large \ninvestment targets, ODA partners are prepared to increase their level of assistance. Accordingly, \na December 2006 consultative group (CG) meeting witnessed a record-high ODA pledge of \n$4.4 billion. However, the country\u2019s absorptive capacity remains a serious concern. Although it \nis recognized that the ODA projects and programs usually achieve their development objectives \nand the outcomes are satisfactory and sustainable, most projects and programs experience \nsubstantial implementation delays. Slow project implementation has significant consequences \non the achievement of Viet Nam\u2019s development objectives, as well as on the cost of the \ninvestments. \n \n5.  External  agencies  have  repeatedly  presented  this  issue  to  the  Government.  The \nGovernment drafted a strategic framework to mobilize and use ODA more effectively, and is \nupdating the legal and institutional framework governing ODA. A decree on ODA utilization and \nmanagement (Decree 131/2006/ND-CP), approved in November 2006, represents part of the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts. Decree 131 provides the delegation of approval authority on projects and \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2006.

", "2   \nprograms to the line ministries, agencies, or provinces, reducing project implementation delays. \nHowever, the specific steps necessary to implement the decentralization policy, stipulated by \nDecree 131, must be developed based on the detailed Implementing Circulars that are being \nfinalized. Once these are issued, there will be a need to help develop capacity, particularly that \nof the provinces. Clarification at each project level on internal approval authority and procedures \nunder Decree 131 will also be necessary to minimize project implementation delays during the \ntransition period. \n \n6.  The  2006  Country  Portfolio  Review  Mission  (CPRM),  conducted  in  November\u2013\nDecember 2006, was concerned with the deterioration of 2006 disbursement performance. \nDisbursements in 2006 totaled $184.1 million; in 2005, it was $223.7 million. The action plan \ndeveloped  by  the  2006  CPRM  includes:  (i)  simplification  and  decentralization  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s approval procedures; (ii) acceleration of loan processing and reduction of time \nfrom loan approval to signing and effectiveness; (iii) implementation of advance actions to \nreduce start-up delays; (iv) preparation of realistic project implementation plans and projections \nfor contract awards and disbursements; (v) cost estimation in line with market rates; and (vi) \nimproved structure, operation, and capacity of project management units (PMU). \n \n7.  The  need  for  these  actions  were  further  reinforced  by  the  Fifth  Joint  Portfolio \nPerformance Review (JPPR V), jointly conducted in March\u2013May 2007 by the Government\u2019s \nODA Inter-Ministerial Task Force (IMTF) and the Five Banks, i.e., ADB, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, and \nthe World Bank.5 To achieve rapid results, actions that can be implemented quickly without any \nrevision of existing legal framework were identified as the \u201cODA Fast Track\u201d. Implementation of \nthe ODA Fast Track is expected to lead to substantial and immediate reduction of project \nimplementation delays. \n \n8.  Actions identified under the ODA Fast Track are as follows: \n \n(i)  Streamline project preparation documents and process between the Government \nand the Five Banks including: (a) harmonizing the Project Detailed Outline of the \nGovernment and the Project Concept Note of the donors; (b) institutionalizing the \ncommon Feasibility Study (FS) Guidelines; and (c) synchronizing processes with \nupstream  approval  of  the  ODA  Requesting  List  by  the  Prime  Minister  and \napproval of FS by line ministries/agencies prior to loan negotiations. \n(ii)  Include  in  the  Project  Detailed  Outline  the  source  of  funding  for  project \npreparation (from the Government counterpart funds, preparation grants and TAs, \nand other project preparation facilities). \n(iii)  Delink the requirement of Basic Design from the approval of FS by revising \nDecree 112. Until then, in the short-term, this requirement should not apply to \nODA projects and programs. \n(iv)  Base  the  approval  of  program/sector  loan  on  general  program  framework, \nincluding allow delegated management of program/sector loans and consider \napplying these retroactively for ongoing loans. \n(v)  Identify the Project Owner for all ongoing and planned Five Banks\u2019 projects in \naccordance with Decree 131. \n(vi)  Ensure  smooth  transfer  of  staff  involved  in  preparation  stage  to  PMUs  in \nimplementation stage and provide necessary resources for project preparation. \n                                                \n5  In 1999 JPPR began to identify common portfolio performance constraints among the Five Banks.  \n ", "  3 \n(vii)  Conduct advance action by allowing the implementation of appropriate activities \nsuch as procurement, consulting services, resettlement, and other key project \nstart-up activities in the period commencing from FS approved by the competent \nagencies to the timing the loan agreements become effective. \n(viii)  Identify clearly remaining gaps and differences between the Government and \ndonor procurement regulations by: (a) providing clear guidance/training during \nthe project launch to Project Owners, as well as auditors and inspectors, on how \nto deal with the major inconsistencies; and (b) ensuring awareness that in case \nof  conflicts  between  the  Government  and  donor  regulations,  the  agreed \nprocedures in the legal agreement prevail. \n(ix)  Use Article 3.3 of the Procurement Law for ODA projects and programs to: (a) \nestablish a system whereby costs are controlled at the overall project level rather \nthan  on  individual  packages;  (b)  allow  winning  bids  to  exceed  the  approval \nestimated price of the procurement package (exception to Articles 37 and 38); \nand (c) use the market reference prices to establish cost estimates. \n(x)  Revise the restrictions on consultancy rates on ODA projects and programs so \nthat market rates can be paid for high quality consultancy services. \n(xi)  Accelerate payments by clarifying the roles and responsibilities of State Treasury \nand Banks, streamlining processes and establishing business standards for the \nchecking process. \n(xii)  Speed up resettlement activities by piloting the establishment of a separately \nfunded land acquisition/resettlement project, implemented in accordance with the \nGovernment\u2019s and donors\u2019 harmonized social safeguard policies and guidelines. \n \n9.  The IMTF reported the findings and recommendations of the JPPR V to the Prime \nMinister of Viet Nam. The Prime Minister instructed the IMTF to (i) collaborate with relevant \nagencies and the Five Banks to select several specific recommendations proposed by the  \nJPPR V for his approval by August 2007; and (ii) collaborate with the Five Banks to develop an \naction plan for 2007\u20132009, based on the outcomes and recommendations of the JPPR V, \naiming to improve ODA project and program implementation and to disburse $11 billion during \n2006\u20132010. \n \n10.  The Five Banks are committed to helping the Government implement the ODA Fast \nTrack as instructed by the Prime Minister. The proposed TA will form a part of the Five Banks\u2019 \njoint efforts to enable the Government to overcome various difficulties at the project level under \nthe transition to the new legal and institutional framework for ODA. It will also achieve rapid and \ntangible improvements in the portfolio performance of ODA projects and programs.  \n \n11.  The Government intends to promote social support mobilization in public investment \nprojects and programs. Social support mobilization is expected to be beneficial particularly to \nactivities that require extensive public awareness, e.g., human immunodeficiency virus/acquired \nimmunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) prevention and traffic safety campaigns. The proposed \nTA  will  also  help  the  Government  to  pilot  social  support  mobilization  and  prepare \nrecommendations to expand it. \n \nIII.

Impact and Outcome \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n12.  The TA will assist the Government in strengthening the absorptive capacity of ODA and \nimproving efficiency in preparation, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of ODA \n ", "4   \nprojects and programs under the new framework governing ODA under Decree 131. The TA\u2019s \nexpected outcome will be improved performance of ADB\u2019s portfolio in Viet Nam, as indicated by \nimprovements in contract awards and disbursements and the reduction of start-up delays. The \nTA will also contribute to the ongoing joint efforts by the Government and development partners \ntowards  harmonization  under  the  framework  of  the  Hanoi  Core  Statement  (HCS)  on  Aid \nEffectiveness. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will help the Government in (i) conducting in-depth analysis of the bottlenecks to \nimplementing the selected actions of the ODA Fast Track,6 (ii) specifying the steps necessary to \nimplement each action, and (iii) identifying the responsible parties and time frame to implement \neach  action.  Considering  that  the  ADB  portfolio  is  part  of  the  country\u2019s  overall  ODA,  a  \nwell-coordinated  approach  with  all  principal  stakeholders,  i.e.,  the  Government  and  its \ndevelopment partners, will be applied in implementing the TA. \n \n14.  The actions to be covered by the TA will include (i) identification of the line agency, \nproject owner, and PMU, as outlined in Decree 131, for each ongoing or planned project \nfinanced by ADB; (ii) advance contracting for procurement and consultants, resettlement, and \nother key project start-up activities; (iii) smooth transfer of staff involved in the preparation stage \nto PMUs in the implementation stage; (iv) use of the aligned monitoring tool and the portfolio \nmonitoring tool; (v) harmonization of the social and environmental safeguard policies of the \nGovernment  and  development  partners;  (vi)  capacity  strengthening  for  the  line  ministries, \nagencies,  or  provinces  to  assume  new  responsibilities  and  requirements  regarding  project \nadministration and management in the context of Decree 131; and (vii) piloting social support \nmobilization and preparation of recommendations for further expansion. \n \n15.  The TA will undertake a series of workshops and seminars to consult and disseminate \nthe TA findings to relevant stakeholders. The TA will also assist the Government in conducting \nanalytical works to prepare necessary inputs to important meetings, e.g., CG meetings. \n \n16.  Capacity building will be an important part of the TA activities. Training programs for \nofficials of central Government agencies and local governments, as well as PMUs, will be \nconducted regularly on ADB\u2019s procedures and requirements related to project implementation, \nincluding (i) management of ordinary capital resources; (ii) cost and benefit analysis; (iii) new \npolicies, instruments, and modes; and (iv) financial management. Training of trainers will be \nemphasized to ensure sustainability. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $800,000 equivalent, with the Government \nrequesting that ADB finance the equivalent of $700,000. The details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. ADB\u2019s TA funding program will provide a grant to finance the \nTA, and the Government will finance the balance of $100,000 by providing counterpart staff, \noffice space, furniture, administrative support services and logistics, and necessary data.  \n \n                                                \n6  The Five Banks will share responsibilities in helping the Government to implement the ODA Fast Track. \n ", "  5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The Foreign Economic Relations Department (FERD) of the Ministry of Planning and \nInvestment will be the Executing Agency for the TA. FERD will provide overall guidance for TA \nimplementation,  ensure  interagency  coordination,  and  issue  appropriate  directives  and \ndecisions. FERD and ADB will ensure close coordination among Government agencies and \ndevelopment partners, e.g., IMTF and the Five Banks, through existing forum. FERD also will \nconduct training courses on the implementation procedures and requirements of ADB-financed \nprojects and programs. The State Bank of Viet Nam, by request, will conduct some special \ntraining courses on ADB project implementation at a total cost not exceeding $50,000. \n \n19.  The  TA  will  require  8  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  \n60 person-months of national consulting services. The international consultants will provide \nexpertise  in  institutional  development  (3  person-months)  and  capacity  building  \n(3  person-months).  The  national  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  legal  aspects  \n(6 person-months), public training (6 person-months), economics (10 person-months), social \ndevelopment  (10  person-months),  environmental  matters  (6  person-months),  social  and \nresettlement matters (6 person-months), and monitoring and evaluation (6 person-months). Two \nperson-months of international and 10 person-months of national consultants are allocated to \nactivities that are not yet identified to ensure flexibility in the TA\u2019s implementation. ADB will \nengage consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). All international and national consultants will be selected and \ncontracted individually. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The \nconsulting services required for the TA will include, but will not necessarily be limited to, the \nservices  described  in  this  appendix.  The  consultants  may  augment  the  tasks  outlined  as \nrequired  by  FERD  and  ADB  to  improve  the  TA\u2019s  overall  quality.  Local  nongovernment \norganizations  will  be  consigned  to  pilot  social  support  mobilization  using  consultants\u2019 \nqualification selection. FERD may procure equipment through shopping in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Upon completion of the \nTA, this equipment will be transferred to FERD. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years, from September 2007 to August 2010. The \nfollowing major reports are required from each consultant: (i) an inception report describing the \ndetailed  work  program  within  2  weeks  of  commencement  of  the  assignment,  (ii)  progress \nreports every 2 months during the assignment, (iii) a draft final report describing the detailed TA \nfindings 1 month before completion of the assignment, and (iv) a final report 2 weeks after \nreceiving comments from the Government and ADB on the draft final report. Tripartite meetings \nwill be held with the Government, ADB, and consultants to discuss the TA reports, which will be \nprepared in English and translated into Vietnamese. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Enhancing Official Development \nAssistance Absorptive Capacity and Efficiency, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources/ \nDesign  Performance  Assumptions \nReporting \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nStrengthened  ODA disbursement reaches  CG meeting  \u2022  Harmonization efforts \nGovernment\u2019s ODA  $11 billion for 2006\u20132010  by the Government \nabsorptive capacity  and donors continue \nunder the HCS \nframework \n \nRisk \n \n\u2022  Economic growth \nslows significantly, \nleading to lower \ndemand for ODA \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nImproved performance  Contract award and  Quarterly PPR  \u2022  Government \nof ADB\u2019s portfolio  disbursement increased by    commitment remains \n50% by 2010  CPRM  unchanged \n   \nLoan and TA extensions  JPPR \nreduced by 30% by 2010 \n \nAt-risk projects reduced by \n30% by 2010 \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.
