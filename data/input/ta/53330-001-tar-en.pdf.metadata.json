INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will complement Kazakhstan\u2019s \nefforts  to  promote  sustainable  economic  development  through  improved  use  of  digital \ntechnologies, in line with the government\u2019s Digital Kazakhstan program.1 The TA will support the \nfollowing activities: (i) mapping of existing opportunities and obstacles to adopting selected digital \ntechnology solutions, (ii) developing the capacity of local stakeholders to apply selected high-level \ntechnologies, and (iii) conducting feasibility studies in the areas of smart -city, grid, metering for \npossible future Asian Development Bank (ADB) investment projects. \n \n2.  By promoting high-level technologies, the TA project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.2 \nThe TA project is also fully aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Kazakhstan, 2017\u2013\n2021, which highlights ADB\u2019s role in supporting the social impact of technology solutions in areas \nsuch as municipal services, e-commerce, agribusiness, green economy, and finance.3 \n \n3.  The TA project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Kazakhstan, \n2020\u20132022. 4  Its  implementation  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  focus  on  supporting  economic \ndiversification through technological change and capacity development of developing member \ncountry (DMC) stakeholders.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Kazakhstan is seeking to transform its economy and improve people\u2019s living standards by \npromoting the use of information and communication technology (ICT) as outlined in the Digital \nKazakhstan state program (footnote 1). The Ministry of Digital Development, Innovations and \nAerospace  Industry  (MDDIAI)  manages  the  country\u2019s  digitalization  agenda.6 However,  the \nMDDIAI  makes  limited  information  available  to  development  partners  and  other  external \nstakeholders on the country\u2019s progress in digitalizing. What information it does make available is \nscattered and often provided with a substantial time lag, limiting its usefulness for development \npartners in supporting initiatives that incorporate high-level technologies. \n \n5.  The goal of Digital Kazakhstan is to use ICT to accelerate economic growth and raise \nliving standards. The program is running over 5 years, from 2018 to 2022. The central government \nhas allocated T141 billion (about $400 million) for the project; however, completing most of \nprogram\u2019s components will require about $500 million in additional private and quasi-government \nfunding. While the government has made an effort to highlight the opportunities that Digital \nKazakhstan will create, it has provided few details on the program\u2019s incentive systems and \nadaptation mechanisms and tends to downplay challenges facing Kazakhstan in adopting high-\n \n1  Government of Kazakhstan. 2017.

Manila. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 August 2019. \n6  To do this, MDDIAI uses \u201cBitrix24,\u201d a web-based project management platform with time tracking, workflow \nautomation tools, Gantt charts, group chats, video conferencing and other document management and task \ncollaboration tools. The information is used internally by decision-makers in the MDDIAI, while reports produced for \nexternal parties contain limited information. \n ", "2 \nlevel technologies. ADB experience in supporting DMCs with digital technologies shows that \nasymmetric information, externalities, and spillover effects often tend to preclude stakeholders \nfrom championing digital technology solutions. As a result, DMCs often fail to identify and adopt \nemerging high-level technologies. \n \n6.  Citizens, the government, and businesses require ICT skills and knowledge to exploit \ndigital technologies. One goal of Digital Kazakhstan is to foster entrepreneurship and create a \nculture of innovation in Kazakhstan. A program priority was the formation of Astana Hub, a \ntechnology  incubator  launched  in  November  2018  that  features  accelerator  for  high-level \ntechnology start-ups, co-working spaces, and office space for tech firms. One important role of \nAstana Hub is to assist start-ups in marketing their products to the wider Asia and Pacific region.   \nThe state program aims to raise the country\u2019s rank in the Innovation Capacity Index from 87th in \n2018 to 63rd by 2022 and attract T123 billion (about $360 million) in start-up funding from 2019 \nto 2022. The ICT ecosystem is in its infancy and will strongly benefit from ADB support. \n \n7.  Digital ICT in Kazakhstan has a strong potential to raise productivity and lower the cost of \nproduction while promoting environment-friendly development and creating jobs. Key constraints \nare (i) significant underinvestment by the government and the private sector in new technologies, \nand (ii) limited local government capacity to promote high-level technologies. ADB can play an \nimportant role in capacity building and promoting the adoption of high-level technologies in the \ncountry.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n8.  The knowledge and support TA will complement Kazakhstan\u2019s goal of improving its \ncitizens\u2019 quality of life and promoting sustainable economic growth through improved uptake of \ndigital technologies. The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) pace of the country\u2019s \neconomic development accelerated, and (ii) peoples\u2019 quality of life improved (footnote 1). The TA \nwill have the following outcome: innovative high-level technologies promoted.7 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output  1:  Identifying  opportunities  and  obstacles  to  adopting  selected  digital \ntechnology solutions. Under this output, the executing and implementing agencies will provide \nADB with a list of high-level technologies that it is considering promoting. ADB will consider the \npotential development impacts of the items on the list and provide feedback on the opportunities \nand risks associated with each technology. ADB will support the introduction of advanced and \ncomprehensive analytical tools such as value for money and total cost of ownership analyses.  \n \n10.  Output  2:  Capacity  of  local  government  stakeholders  to  promote  high-level \ntechnologies improved. The TA project will support capacity development of  government \nagencies in effectively promoting application of digital technologies. The TA project will also \nfacilitate transfer of knowledge and partnerships between local agencies and global centers of \nexcellence, particularly in partnership with agencies from the Republic of Korea. To ensure the \nsustainability of its capacity-building efforts, ADB will provide support to Astana Hub and other \ninstitutions dedicated to improving uptake of high-level technologies in Kazakhstan. The TA \nproject will promote awareness of the opportunities and risks of digital technologies (to be \n \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nidentified under output 1) among stakeholders. The findings of the ADB March 2019 scoping \nmission suggest that there is merit in ADB focusing its support on social innovation start-ups.8 \n \n11.  Output 3: Feasibility of digital technology solutions in select areas for sustainable \ndevelopment analyzed. The ADB March and October 2019 scoping missions identified possible \ninterventions to assist Kazakhstan with identifying and applying digital technologies to support the \ndevelopment of (i) smart cities and (ii) smart grid and smart metering.9 Under this output, ADB \nalong with the executing and implementing agencies will undertake feasibilities studies of the \nidentified technologies. The studies may result in future ADB grant- or loan-financed projects, \nprovided such projects satisfy ADB investment criteria. ADB will disseminate lessons and best \npractices emanating from the feasibility studies through capacity-development activities under \noutput 2 and other means. The feasibility studies will focus on the following: \n \n(i)  Smart cities program of Kazakhstan. The government has developed a smart city \nconcept for the country\u2019s five largest cities. The TA project will focus on one or two \nsmart city action areas, such as smart transportation integrating ride-sharing into the \npublic transport system. ADB will support developing either individual integrated smart \nplanning systems for the five cities in line with its regional Promoting Smart Systems \nin  ADB's  Future  Cities  Program,10 or  digital  infrastructure  such  as  digital  IDs, \ngeographic  information  system-enabled  platforms,  and/or  integrated \npayment infrastructure. \n \n(ii)  Smart grid and smart metering. Kazakhstan lacks capacity to manage nationwide \nenergy demand and supply (for instance, through variable tariffs). The TA project will \nconduct a feasibility study on introducing a smart grid system to monitor and control \nenergy transmission and distribution networks more efficiently. Smart grid systems \nentail  linking  the  national  transmission  grid  with  a  sophisticated  national  energy \ninformation system. In addition, the TA project will assess the benefits of installing \nsmart meters\u2014meters integrated with the national energy grid\u2014at the household level. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nRepublic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The MDDIAI will be the executing agency of the TA project, while government line \nministries and agencies will be the implementing agencies, depending on the areas and sectors \nof the feasibility studies.11 ADB\u2019s Kazakhstan Resident Mission will administer the TA. The Digital \nTechnology for Development Unit of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment  will  support  all  TA  project  activities.
