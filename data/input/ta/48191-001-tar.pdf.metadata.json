INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) recognizes the importance of good governance in \npromoting  sustainable  development  and  enhancing  economic  efficiency  and  productivity. \nCognizant  of the  impact  of  effective  decision  making  underpinned  by  transparent financial \ninformation  on  development  and  reforms,  ADB  underscored  the  significance  of  good \ngovernance in its operations through its governance policy1 approved by the ADB Board of \nDirectors in October 1995. The Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan,2 approved \nin  July  2006,  further  emphasizes  the  objective  of  improving  ADB\u2019s  performance  in  the \nimplementation of governance and anticorruption policies in sectors and subsectors where ADB \nis active. \n \n2.  This  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the  enhancement  of  the  financial \nmanagement capacity in Asia and the Pacific. The TA will focus on three pillars supporting \neffective financial management: (i) the quality of project auditing by private audit professionals, \n(ii)  financial  management  assessments  of  ADB-financed  projects,  and  (iii)  project  financial \nreporting through application of the cash basis International Public Sector Accounting Standards \n(IPSAS). The TA will be implemented in partnership with the Confederation of Asian and Pacific \nAccountants (CAPA). A fact-finding mission was held on 13\u201314 August 2014 in Ha Noi, Viet \nNam to discuss the objectives of the TA with CAPA, which included (i) identification of suitable \nprofessional accountancy organizations (PAOs) for pilot implementation, (ii) agreement on the \nroles and responsibilities of ADB and CAPA, (iii) confirmation of the concept and scope of the \ncomponent,  and  (iv)  agreement  on  a  timetable  and  course  of  actions.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The need to enhance the auditing capacity of public and private professionals. \nAuditing capacity in Asia and the Pacific is constrained by limited resources, poor professional \ncompetency, and lack of regulatory oversight. ADB can support the enhancement of auditing \ncapacity  through  its  partnership  in  the  Memorandum  of  Understanding  to  Strengthen \nAccountancy and Improve Collaboration4 that aims to provide an enabling environment for the \ncapacity  development  of  PAOs.  PAOs  contribute  to  the  strengthening  of  national  financial \narchitectures  through,  among  others,  development  of  quality  assurance  systems.  A  robust \nquality assurance system will promote discipline, cross-reviews, and investigation; enhance \napplication of professional and ethical practice standards; and reinforce best practices. This, in \nturn, will contribute to the production of high-quality and reliable financial statements.5 \n \n4.  The  need  to  strengthen  financial  management  assessments  of  ADB  projects. \nStrengthening  the  financial  management  assessments  of  ADB  projects  is  another  tool  in \npromoting good governance. Conducting a robust financial management assessment requires a \nfirm understanding of the developing member country (DMC) systems (funds flow, accounting, \n                                                \n1  ADB. 1995.

Memorandum of Understanding to Strengthen Accountancy \nand  Improve  Collaboration.  New  York.  The  memorandum,  to  which  ADB  is  a  signatory,  aims  to  improve \ncooperation and collaboration between IFAC and the international development community in improving the \ncapacity of PAOs as well as the quality of financial management systems in emerging economies. \n5  Memorandum  of  Understanding  to  Strengthen  Accountancy  and  Improve  Collaboration.  2013.

New York. \n ", "2  \nreporting, auditing, and internal control systems, as well as foreign exchange policies) to enable \nproject  teams  to  effectively  evaluate  fiduciary  risks  and  articulate  appropriate  mitigating \napproaches and reforms. However, there is currently no readily available material that provides \nthis information. The World Bank\u2019s reports on the observance of standards and codes on \naccounting  and  auditing6 pertain  to  corporate  financial  systems  and  have  been  largely \ndiscontinued. \n \n5.  The need to improve the quality of project financial statements prepared under the \ncash basis of accounting. In the recent survey conducted by ADB\u2019s Strategy and Policy \nDepartment, participated in by ADB\u2019s regional departments and supported by ADB\u2019s Financial \nManagement Unit (OSFM), 25 out of 33 DMCs prepare project financial statements under the \ncash basis or modified cash basis of accounting. Because varying accounting standards are \nused by DMCs, the audited project financial statements submitted to ADB are often inconsistent, \nincomparable, and not compliant with the requirements of the cash basis IPSAS. Given that \nADB requires project financial statements prepared under the cash basis of accounting to \ncomply with the requirements of this standard (or its national equivalent), the executing or \nimplementing agency tasked with the preparation and submission of the audited project financial \nstatements needs to acquire an understanding of, and become familiar with, the accounting and \ndisclosure requirements of the cash basis IPSAS. \n \n6.  Strategic consistency. The scope of the TA is threefold, and aims to promote effective \ngovernance in ADB projects consistent with the three priority areas identified in the Midterm \nReview  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020:  (i)  regional  cooperation  and  integration,  (ii)  knowledge \nsolutions, and (iii) delivering value for money in ADB.7 The TA will support ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 \nby  (i)  enhancing  capacities  of  professionals  who  are  charged  with  the  audit  of  financial \nstatements, (ii) developing ADB staff\u2019s capacity to conduct financial management assessments, \nand (iii) improving the capacity of executing and implementing agencies that prepare project \nfinancial statements. Over time, these activities are expected to directly improve the preparation \nof reliable and transparent financial reports. The TA is consistent with and supports the ongoing \nefforts of ADB regional departments to strengthen financial management arrangements and \ncapacity. \n \n7.  Lessons. The TA will incorporate lessons and experiences from earlier projects8 that \nwere geared towards the development of private sector accounting and auditing professionals \nthrough enhanced professional supervision arrangements and ethical and internal procedure \ncodes. The TA will also complement an existing TA project on supporting the International \nPublic  Sector  Accounting  Standards  Board  work  program  for  2013\u20132015,  particularly  in \npromoting the adoption and implementation of the IPSAS.9 It will capitalize on the outputs of \nprevious IPSAS board-related projects in designing the e-learning module to ensure consistency \nwith the training courses and teaching materials developed earlier.   \n                                                \n6  For the selected DMCs, the reports on the observance of standards and codes are dated (Bangladesh, 2003; Fiji, \nnil; Indonesia, 2010; Myanmar, nil; Nepal, nil; Pakistan, 2005; Sri Lanka, 2004, and Viet Nam, nil).  \n7  ADB. 2014.

The impact will be enhanced governance and financial management in Asia and the \nPacific. The outcome will be strengthened capacity of auditors, enhanced ADB project financial \nmanagement assessments, and improved government financial reporting. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will produce three outputs: (i) piloting audit quality assurance systems for PAOs, \n(ii) developing working papers on DMC financial management systems, and (iii) developing an \ne-learning module on preparing project financial statements using the cash basis IPSAS. \n \n10.  For output 1, a study of the PAOs\u2019 existing quality assurance systems will be conducted \nin collaboration with CAPA.10 Given CAPA's role11 in Asia and the Pacific and its membership \n(comprising  PAOs),  it  is  strategically  positioned  to  coordinate  TA  activities.  The  team  of \nconsultants will conduct the survey, which will be used for gap analysis and in identifying the \nPAOs' long- and short-term strategies to address capacity constraints. CAPA will facilitate the \nconduct of the survey and will review and comment on the survey and its findings. A good-\npractice road map will be developed which will serve as a starting point to further develop PAO-\nspecific  road  maps  based  on  the  results  of  the  survey  to  guide  improvements  in  quality \nassurance.12 The road maps will apply the International Auditing and Assurance Standards \nBoard's audit framework13 and will be guided by the Statement of Membership Obligations 1 of \nthe International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).14 CAPA will coordinate with the participating \nPAOs  and  will  monitor  and  measure  results  annually. 15  It  is  expected  that  the  pilot \nimplementation will include five DMCs\u2014Bangladesh, Cambodia, Myanmar, Nepal and Samoa \nhave been initially identified.16 These DMCs either have member bodies in CAPA with differing \nlevels of maturity or have PAOs that have expressed interest in participating in the TA. National \nworkshops will be held to promote the quality assurance road maps and gain commitment from \nthe PAOs. \n \n11.  Output  2  will  produce  working  papers  on  the  financial  management  systems  of \nBangladesh, Fiji, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam.17 The TA will \n                                                \n10  CAPA is a regional accountancy organization in Asia and the Pacific with 31 PAO members in 23 jurisdictions. It \nis a regional organization recognized by IFAC. \n11  CAPA aims to contribute to the formation and development of strong and sustainable PAOs capable of providing \nand maintaining accountants to effectively meet the needs of the countries in which they operate. \n12  The TA will consider the possible synergies between PAOs and supreme audit institutions through the plans to \nimprove the capacities of private and public auditors. \n13  International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. 2014. A Framework for Audit Quality: Key Elements that \nCreate an Environment for Audit Quality. New York. \n14  IFAC. 2012. Statements of Membership Obligations 1\u20137. New York (revised). The Statement of Membership \nObligations 1 sets the requirements for quality assurance review systems for firms performing certain audit, \nreview, other assurance, and related services agreements. \n15  CAPA will secure the PAOs\u2019 confirmation of participation prior to commencement of activities. In addition, the \nPAOs will commit in writing to implement the road map and provide an annual status update to CAPA for a \nminimum of three years from project completion. CAPA will monitor implementation progress and achievement of \noutcome, and provide feedback to ADB and PAOs accordingly.  \n16  Limited outreach activities with the Fiji Institute of Accountants may be included, and will be determined during \nproject implementation based on further consultations with CAPA and the Fiji Institute of Accountants. \n17  These DMCs have been preselected as pilots given the presence of control officers and/or financial management \nofficer in ADB\u2019s resident missions to ensure (i) existing information and/or knowledge are used; (ii) a system of \n ", "4  \nuse  the  recently  produced  Operational  Knowledge  Working  Paper  on  the  Funds  Flow, \nAccounting, and Audit arrangements in India18 as a guide and will conduct interviews and \nconsultations with ADB\u2019s control officers and financial management officers in resident missions \n(where  available)  and  relevant  government  representatives.  The  working  papers  will  be \ndisseminated  as  a  tool  in  conducting  financial  management  assessments  during  project \npreparation. The initial set of working papers will be published on ADB\u2019s website and will be \nscaled up to cover other DMCs in Asia and the Pacific in future TA projects. \n \n12.  Output 3 will produce an e-learning module that provides the requirements of the cash \nbasis IPSAS. The TA will leverage existing products produced by international consulting or \naudit  firms,  or  international  institutes  (e.g.,  the  Chartered  Institute  of  Public  Finance  and \nAccountancy), given their experience and credibility in the market, and will incorporate ADB\u2019s \nrequirements on financial reporting and auditing of projects. The module will use an open-\nsource software application that can be maintained by ADB to eliminate issues of proprietary \nrights and maintenance. The TA will use experienced consultants in the design of the content \nand layout of the module and the web page, under the supervision of the consulting firm. This \nmodule  will  produce  certifications  at the  completion  of the  course  and  track  the  students\u2019 \nlearning progression over time. It will be hosted on ADB\u2019s website and will be accessible by all \nexisting  and  potential  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  other  interested  DMC  staff \nincluding supreme audit institutions, and private auditors. A workshop will be held to launch and \npromote the e-learning module.19 \n \n13.  The TA will be dependent on the cooperation and commitment of CAPA, the PAOs, and \nrelevant DMC staff. ADB will closely coordinate with these institutions during implementation \nand will monitor activities of consultants to reduce the risk and ensure completion and delivery \nof outputs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $730,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency, with OSFM acting as focal point and providing overall \nTA oversight and administration. OSFM will work closely with CAPA and ADB resident missions \nthat, in turn, will be coordinating and guiding the consultants. The TA is expected to commence \nin October 2014 and be completed by December 2017. For output 1, CAPA will provide in-kind \ncontributions  in  the  form  of  advisory  and  facilitation  support.20 CAPA  will  coordinate  PAO \nselection to ensure that the TA does not duplicate ongoing work financed by other development \npartners and to further ensure PAOs\u2019 interest in participation. For output 1, (i) implementation \nwill adhere to joint ADB and CAPA consultancy recruitment efforts (develop detailed terms of \n                                                                                                                                                       \nknowledge consolidation is provided for information that is available but undocumented; (iii) redundant activities in \ngathering information are avoided; and (iv) activities are streamlined, costs reduced, and actions more focused. \n18  ADB. 2014.

The TA will require a total of 37.5 person-months of intermittent consulting inputs from \ninternational  (11.5  person-months)  and  national  consultants  (26  person-months).  An \ninternational audit expert with extensive experience in auditing and project implementation will \nbe engaged to lead a team of five national audit experts in developing quality assurance road \nmaps for the selected DMCs. Output 2 will be developed by eight public financial management \nexperts who are nationals of the respective pilot DMCs and have extensive background in \naccounting, finance, or any closely related field. For output 3, the TA will engage a consulting \nfirm  (an  accounting  firm  or  international  institute)  experienced  in  developing  and  running \ncourses  on  accounting  standards  through  an  e-learning  platform.  The  consulting  firm  will \nprovide an audit specialist with technical expertise in international accounting and auditing \nstandards, an e-learning module developer experienced in software development, and a web \ndesigner. The e-learning module will be developed using open-source software and will be \npublished on ADB\u2019s website. Maintenance of the e-learning module will be the responsibility of \nOSFM. \n \n17.  Individual consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The consulting firm will be engaged \nusing quality- and cost-based selection with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 to ensure the specific \nexpertise  and  specialization  required  for  the  output.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3 and will be refined during implementation. Disbursements under \nthe TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n18.  OSFM  will  closely  monitor  the  progress  of  the  TA  and  will  coordinate  with  CAPA \nregularly. Work plans will be developed by the consultants at the onset in consultation with \nrelevant stakeholders, and these will drive TA activities. ADB will review and approve all outputs. \n \nIV.
