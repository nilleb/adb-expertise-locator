INTRODUCTION\n1. The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the developing member\ncountries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to accelerate action on climate change,\nthereby helping to implement ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priority 3 (OP3) on tackling climate\nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability.1\nThe TA will build institutional capacity through technical support and policy advice to DMCs to (i)\ndevelop long-term low-greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and resilient development strategies; (ii)\nmobilize, track and report on climate finance; (iii) enhance management of climate and disaster\nrisks; and (iv) ensure national strategies and policies are aligned with the goals of the Paris\nAgreement on climate change to limit the global temperature increase to 2 degrees C, and pursue\nefforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees C.\n2. The TA is aligned with Strategy 2030 and will support the implementation of the OP3\noperational plan, specifically the following strategic operational priorities: increasing climate\nchange mitigation actions, and building climate and disaster resilience.2  The TA will also\ncontribute  to  other  operational  priorities,  specifically  1  (addressing  remaining  poverty  and\nreducing inequalities), 2 (accelerating progress in gender equality), 5 (strengthening governance\nand institutional capacity), and 7 (fostering regional cooperation and integration). The TA is\nincluded in the 2019 and 2020 Management-approved results-based work plan of the Sustainable\nDevelopment and Climate Change Department. 3\nII. ISSUES\n3. The Asia and Pacific region is highly vulnerable to climate change, which pressures both\nhuman and natural systems. The deterioration of Asia\u2019s mountain \u201cwater towers\u201d,4 prolonged heat\nwaves, coastal sea-level rise, and changes in rainfall patterns will disrupt ecosystem services;\nthis will in turn impact livelihoods, human health, and migration patterns, and possibly lead to\nconflicts.5  The poor, women, children, and elderly will be disproportionately affected. The Asia\nand Pacific region incurs an average of $200 million in daily losses due to disasters, and climate\nchange is increasingly exacerbating these losses.6 The high cost of addressing climate change\nwill increase if action on climate change is delayed.  While important steps have been taken to\nmitigate and adapt to climate change, it is critical that DMCs increase their capacity to implement\naction on climate change toward achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals.\n4. The Paris Agreement encourages countries to formulate and communicate long-term\n(mid-century) strategies (LTSs) for low-GHG-emission development taking into account the\nnational development context, and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. To\ncollectively achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement, countries need to establish long-term\ntargets informed by science, and identify feasible pathways for a just transition to a net-zero\nemission,  resilient,  and  inclusive  economy.  LTSs  should  be  dynamic  instruments  that  are\n1  ADB. 2018. ADB Strategy 2030 Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n2  ADB. 2019.

", "2 \nembedded  in  the  national  planning  process,  establish  a  whole-of-economy  approach  to \ndecarbonization  and  building  resilience,  while  seeking  to  maximize  economic  and  social \ndevelopment benefits.7 Once established, LTSs can guide short and medium-term decision-\nmaking, including formulation of more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions, and help \nDMCs manage tradeoffs between short-term benefits and long-term transition.8 LTSs will also \nprovide greater long-term certainty to support expanded investment, including private sector \ninvestment, and investment in research, development and piloting of innovative solutions; and \nenable DMCs to better align financial flows with national climate-related actions and ambitions in \norder to prioritize low-carbon and resilient investments.9  \n5. The Paris Agreement establishes the need for an LTS but does not specify the scope or\nformat, which can be determined by each country.10 Development of an LTS will require significant\nnational engagement and resources. It should be country-led, considering national development\npriorities, strategies and plans, and reflecting the country\u2019s resources, climate risk and GHG\nemission profile. DMCs need to develop the necessary capacity to prepare for and plan their LTS\nand manage its implementation and updating. The development process will require DMCs to\nestablish their long-term development vision and make decisions about preparing the LTS,\nincluding how comprehensive it should be. They will need to establish sustainable processes for\nstakeholder consultation, inter-ministerial coordination, governance, and decision making. The\nLTS will be supported by sector and macroeconomic modelling, and DMCs need to identify and\nbuild the capacity of national bodies or institutions that will undertake these activities.11 The\ncomplexity of the LTS process is illustrated by the limited number of LTSs submitted to date to\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change: 2 by ADB DMCs (Fiji and the\nMarshall Islands), and 19 globally. ADB can support DMCs to strengthen their knowledge and\ncapacity for developing a robust and ambitious LTS, and establish sustainable processes for it to\nbe implemented and updated.\n6. In  the  context  of  the  Paris  Agreement,  LTSs  refer  to  strategies  for  achieving\ndecarbonization by aligning long-term development pathways with the goal of achieving net-\nzero emissions.  Identifying and accounting for climate risk is an equally important component\nof long-term planning, and ADB supports a holistic approach to LTSs that identifies (i) long-\nterm pathways for achieving decarbonization; and (ii) approaches to adaptation that enhance\nadaptive capacity, strengthen resilience, and reduce vulnerability in infrastructure, ecosystems,\n7  World Resources Institute. 2020. What is a Long-term Strategy? The Paris Agreement requires countries to take into \naccount the imperatives of a just transition of the workforce and the creation of decent work and quality jobs as part \nof developing their climate policies and action. Just transition pertains to achieving an environmentally sustainable \neconomy and viewing this as a strong driver of job creation and upgrading, social justice, and poverty eradication. \nThis includes promoting equal access to opportunities for skills acquisition and recognition for all, for young people, \nwomen, and workers who need to be redeployed, including across borders, as described in International Labour \nOrganization. 2015. Guidelines for a just transition towards environmentally sustainable economies and societies for \nall. Geneva. \n8  ADB through its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) Advance platform, is supporting DMCs in developing \nclimate investment plans and improving access to climate finance as part of NDCs implementation. NDCs are part \nof DMCs long-term commitments under the Paris Agreement and linked to the development of LTSs.

Hans et al. 2020. Making Long-Term Low GHG Emissions Development Strategies a Reality. Bonn: Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit. \n11 ADB will support DMCs to plan the development of their LTS in a gender-responsive way, improving gender equality \nand particularly addressing women\u2019s rights and needs. DMCs will be encouraged to include the development of \ngender action plans into the process of developing their LTS by specifying it in their LTS action plan. ", "3 \nsocial and institutional structures, and the financial sector12. It is therefore important that DMCs \nbuild further capacity and understand concepts and available tools to identify climate and \ndisaster risks, and incorporate actions related to climate change adaptation into their policies, \nstrategies and long-term planning.  \n7. The Paris Agreement\u2019s Article 2.1c highlights the importance of aligning finance to\nsupport  action  to  meet  climate-related  temperature  and  adaptation  goals,  reflecting  the\nimportance of ensuring that all finance (public, private, domestic and international) supports\nand does not undermine the transition to low-carbon and resilient development. This will\nrequire that governments and other stakeholders explore tools or mechanisms to manage the\ntransition, and build capacity to mobilize resources, track progress, and raise ambition.13 The\nprivate sector has an important role in driving low-carbon and climate resilient growth in DMCs,\nas a catalyst for greater and more frequent investments that lead to lower costs, more rapid\ntechnology deployment, and more innovative financing approaches. Private sector finance\nreached $326 billion on average annually during 2017\u20132018, accounting for 56% of total\nclimate finance. However, the private sector only accounted for $0.5 billion, or 2%, of the total\nglobal adaptation finance during this period.14 Understanding the factors that limit private\nsector adaptation finance and identifying approaches to increase it in the context of ADB\u2019s\nDMCs will support increased private sector engagement in adaptation. 15\n8. The outcome of the TA for Enhancing Readiness of ADB Developing Member Countries\nfor  Scaled  Up  Climate Finance,16 supported  by the  Climate  Change  Fund,  was  increased\nreadiness of DMCs to access climate finance for low-carbon, climate-resilient infrastructure\nprojects. Approved in 2013 and closed in 2019, the TA supported ADB operations departments\nto develop priority investment projects that could tap into international sources of finance. The\nclimate finance readiness component was highly relevant to the overall Climate Change Fund\nobjective  of facilitating greater climate change investment in DMCs. 17 This TA will build on this\ninitiative to further assist DMCs in improving their systems for accessing climate finance, as well\nas promoting knowledge exchange and sharing of lessons from successful climate financing\napplications, including experience with innovative mechanisms, reflecting the lessons from the\ncompleted TA. Building DMCs\u2019 climate finance capacity can also unlock new public and private\nfinancing sources. Capacity building activities under this TA will build on lessons from past similar\nactivities, including ADB\u2019s experience in the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience.18 For example,\nthe program in Tajikistan highlighted the benefits of a multi-stakeholder approach for capacity\nbuilding, involving participation beyond government and including civil society groups, which\nimproved climate change awareness, knowledge and skills among the participants.\n12 ADB. 2019.

London: Climate Policy Initiative.  \n15  The Climate Policy Initiative reports that efforts to track private finance for adaptation and resilience may be \nconstrained by (i) definitional challenges that make it difficult to distinguish climate-related finance from regular \nbusiness operations and broader development finance, (ii) conceptual and accounting issues, (iii) confidentiality \nrestrictions, and (iv) a lack of universally accepted impact metrics. Uncertainty and risk are barriers to both information \nand action: some adaptation and resilience projects may not be investment-grade, and the jurisdictions most in need \nof adaptation finance have higher market and governance risks, which can deter private investors (footnote 10). \n16 ADB. 2013.Enhancing Readiness of ADB Developing Member Countries for Scaled Up Climate Finance.

The onset of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has further highlighted the\nimportance of long-term planning and a sustainable, low-carbon and climate-resilient recovery.\nCountries must avoid letting concerns about the economic impact of the pandemic override the\nurgency of taking climate action.19 Beyond the emergency COVID-19 response, DMCs must plan\nfor the medium-term recovery phase, including economic stimulus measures and possibly wider\naccompanying reforms, and a longer-term transformation phase that could see wide-ranging\nchanges to systems, institutions, and policies.20 There is an urgent need for ADB to support\ncountries to direct stimulus spending toward interventions that can deliver strong economic and\nsocial benefits to achieve recovery goals while also supporting actions related to climate change,\naddressing vulnerabilities, and improving resilience.\n10. ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 aims to achieve a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable\nAsia and the Pacific. ADB has set a target of ensuring that at least 75% of its committed operations\n(by number, on a 3-year rolling average, including sovereign and non-sovereign operations) will\nsupport climate change mitigation and adaptation by 2030. Climate finance from ADB\u2019s own\nresources is also targeted to reach $80 billion during 2019\u20132030. To implement OP3 and achieve\ncorporate climate targets, it is imperative that climate change and climate and disaster resilience\nare mainstreamed in ADB operations. To do this, ADB needs to ensure that DMCs have the\ncapacity to identify and implement policies and strategies that support their climate change\nmitigation and adaptation needs.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Impact and Outcome\n11.

The \nroster of technical experts will support and advise DMCs in (i) identifying, developing and \ndesigning climate mitigation measures in investment projects;26 (ii) estimating associated costs of \nclimate measures; (iii) assessing alignment of activities to the Paris Agreement; and (iv) advising \non climate change strategies and policies, including LTSs.  \n13. Output 2. Knowledge on climate change related concepts and tools improved. This\noutput will be delivered through the following activities: (i) conduct regional training programs to\nbuild DMCs\u2019 capacity in order to (a) enhance the understanding of the role of climate finance, how\nto estimate and determine climate finance, and sources of climate finance (mitigation and\nadaptation finance); (b) address climate change impacts and climate risk management; (c) align\ninvestment projects and programs to the Paris Agreement; (d) increase knowledge of concepts\nrelated to a just transition and LTSs, including their integration into national development planning;\nand (e) support the design of low-carbon and climate-resilient interventions during the COVID-19\nrecovery period; and (ii) produce relevant knowledge products, including products addressing\nregional climate finance, which will support transition by DMCs to low-carbon and climate-resilient\ndevelopment. Through the regional training, DMCs will learn about and discuss existing climate\nfinance tracking frameworks and methodologies from various institutions; be exposed to the latest\ninformation on climate science, data projections and best practices, including a range of potential\napproaches for climate risk and vulnerability assessment, and methods for climate risk screening;\nand  learn  about  and  apply  relevant  tools  to  help  align  strategies  and  investments  with\ncommitments under the Paris Agreement, as well as key factors involving successful development\nand implementation of LTSs. Training activities will target various government ministries, including\nfinance, environment, economic development, and planning. Non-governmental organizations\nand other stakeholders will also be invited to participate.\n14. This will be ADB\u2019s first LTS and just transition TA, and will significantly contribute to\nadvancing these important agendas in the region. Once established, LTSs can guide ADB\u2019s\nengagement in DMCs across all sectors, and through public and private lending, ensuring that\nADB\u2019s lending and other activities are consistent with the countries\u2019 development goals and\nsupport a just transition. This includes through ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy and project\ndesign processes.  The TA will also support DMCs to consider their long-term climate goals as\npart of planning their COVID-19 economic recovery, thereby supporting DMCs to ensure that\nclimate  action  is  not  delayed  or  de-prioritized  due  to  the  pandemic.  ADB  is  engaged  in\ncollaborative  mechanisms,  platforms  and  processes  supporting  action  on  climate  in  DMCs\n(including LTSs and a just transition) and will coordinate with other development partners to\nmaximize the effectiveness of support to the DMCs. This includes initiatives such as the 2050\nPathways Platform\u2014a multi-stakeholder initiative to support countries with LTS development\u2014\nand the joint multilateral development bank working group on Paris alignment.
