The Government of Viet Nam has developed for Vietnamese education a long-term \ndevelopment  strategy  covering  the  10  years  from  2001  to  2010.1  The  broad  secondary \neducation  sector  targets  of  the  Government  by  2010  are  to  achieve  (i)  universal  lower \nsecondary education with high quality, and (ii) gradual expansion of diversified upper secondary \neducation.  In  accordance  with  these  sector  targets,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nassisted the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) in formulating a secondary education \nsector master plan to complement the long-term education development strategy covering the \nsame period.2  ADB is supporting lower secondary education development including in-service \nteacher  training,3  and  preservice  teacher  training,4  and  is  preparing  the  Second  Lower \nSecondary Education Development Project.5  For upper secondary education, ADB conditionally \napproved the Upper Secondary Education Development Project (USEDP).6 Accordingly, the \nGovernment  requested  ADB  to  provide  an  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  capacity \nbuilding and institutional strengthening of upper secondary education. The 2003\u20132005 Country \nStrategy  and  Program  Update  for  Viet  Nam  includes  TA  for  Capacity  Building  for  Upper \nSecondary Education in the 2003 TA program.7  The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam \nfrom 11 to 21 February 2003 and reached an understanding with the Government on the \nobjectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and outline \nterms of reference for consultants under the TA.8  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The Vietnamese education system consists of 5 years of primary, 4 years of lower \nsecondary,  and  3  years  of  upper  secondary  education,  followed  by  4-6  years  of  higher \neducation. The administration of education and training is complex as it is shared among the \ncentral,  provincial,  and  district  governments  and  the  communes,  with  centralized  decision \nmaking and decentralized implementation. MOET is responsible for all education and training in \nthe  country  in  terms  of  policy  formulation,  guidance,  and  supervision.  Lower  secondary \neducation is administered by bureaus of education and training at the district level, and upper \nsecondary education is administered by the provincial departments of education and training \n(DOETs) under the supervision of MOET and the provincial people\u2019s committees. In-service \nlower and upper secondary teacher training is administered and provided by DOETs, while \npreservice lower secondary teacher training is provided by teacher training colleges and upper \nsecondary teacher training is provided by teacher training universities and education faculties of \nuniversities. \n \n3.  The Government has committed itself to achieve Millennium Development Goals, which \ninclude  universal  primary  education  by  2015.  Access  to  primary  education  became  near-\n                                                 \n1  MOET.  2002.

Country Strategy and Program Update (2003\u20132005): Viet Nam. Manila \n8  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Version) on 24 January 2003. ", "2 \nuniversal in 2000 with the net enrollment rate of 95%, and the net enrollment rate in primary \neducation is expected to reach 99% by 2010. While the Government plans to consolidate \nuniversal primary education and universalize lower secondary education with quality by 2010, \nthe  development  of  upper  secondary  education  is  increasingly  given  high  priority  by  the \nGovernment because it is expected to provide the level of human resources required to meet \nthe  country\u2019s  critical  social  and  economic  development  goals  and  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction. The secondary education sector master plan, funded by ADB, serves as an analytical \ntool and guide for future decision making, including policy frameworks, feasible strategies, and \ninvestment priorities. The plan analyzes capacity building issues in upper secondary education \nrelated to (i) quality, (ii) access, and  (iii) management. \n \n4.  Due to a combination of tight social organization and route learning techniques, upper \nsecondary education has not adequately served to produce graduates prepared for Viet Nam\u2019s \nindustrialization  and  economic  modernization.  Therefore,  MOET  is  giving  high  priorities  to \nimproving the quality of education in order to develop a creative, flexible, self-motivated, and \nskilled  labor  force  for  a  knowledge-  and  market-based  economy.  The  Government  has \ndeveloped a new, diversified curriculum, textbooks, and instructional materials using active \nlearning approaches, and will pilot the diversified curriculum, textbooks, instructional materials, \nand related in-service teacher training starting in September 2003 in 11 selected provinces. The \n11 provinces were selected based on (i) geographical balance, (ii) socioeconomic conditions, \nand (iii) ethnic background, and are Da Nang, Dac Lac, Dong Thap, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, \nHung Yen, Khanh Hoa, Quang Ninh, Son La, Tay Ninh, and Thanh Hoa.  In this connection, the \ncapacity of MOET, DOETs, and other entities urgently needs to be strengthened for effective \nupper secondary education management. Managerial capacity is weak in core competencies \nsuch as the delivery of diversified curriculum and textbooks, instructional materials, and related \nin-service  training  and  other  teacher  support  services,  monitoring  of  teacher  and  student \nperformance, and assessment of students\u2019 learning achievement with appropriate feedback to \nteachers. \n \n5.  A  second  issue  is  to  ensure  adequate  standards  of  upper  secondary  education, \nespecially school facilities and equipment. In recent years, expansion of upper secondary-level \nschool coverage has been rapid and remarkable. During 1994\u20132000, student enrollment in \nupper secondary schools tripled from about 0.73 million to 2.20 million. This rapid increase has \noverwhelmed the institutional and managerial capacity of government entities providing upper \nsecondary education, which has resulted in disparities of access and quality by geographic \nlocation and socioeconomic background. The Government alone cannot meet all the education \nexpansion and quality improvement objectives. Consequently, enrollment in nonpublic upper \nsecondary schools is growing and accounted for 32.6% of total upper secondary enrollment in \n2002. Nonpublic upper secondary schools tend to be in rural, disadvantaged areas. Expanding \nnonpublic upper secondary schools is an important means to expand access, and facilities and \nequipment of upper secondary schools including nonpublic schools should be upgraded to a \nrequired national standard. Public-private partnerships are also needed to upgrade public upper \nsecondary schools to an international standard and establish purely private schools, especially \nin affluent urban areas.    \n \n6.  Third,  almost  no  project  management  training  has  been  provided  to  the  personnel \ninvolved in managing upper secondary education. Previous and ongoing ADB support has \nconcentrated on lower secondary education. At the upper secondary level, MOET and DOET \npersonnel have not developed sufficient capacity in implementing the USEDP, especially in the \nexpertise required for the project start-up period. Additional support for managerial capacity \nbuilding is required to strengthen the capability of central and provincial levels of administration ", "    3 \nin project management, implementation, and monitoring, including financial management and \nprocurement planning. \n \n7.  The TA is consistent with the Government\u2019s policies and priorities in upper secondary \neducation since it will assist MOET, DOETs, and other entities in strengthening their institutional \nand  managerial  capacity  to  renovate  curricula  and  textbooks  and  increase  access  to \ndisadvantaged groups under the decentralized education management structure, which will be \ncarried out by the USEDP. The TA is also consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program, \nwhich  focuses  education  sector  operations  on  helping  the  Government  gradually  expand \ndiversified upper secondary education in accordance with the Government\u2019s primary areas for \nits development and improvement.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n8.  The TA\u2019s overall goal is to gradually expand diversified upper secondary education to \nfacilitate Viet Nam\u2019s industrialization and economic modernization. The purpose of the TA is to \nstrengthen the capacity of MOET, DOETs, and other entities to manage the development and \nimprovement of upper secondary education. More specifically, the TA will (i) help strengthen the \nmanagerial capacity of MOET, DOETs, and other entities to renovate and monitor curricula, \ntextbooks, and in-service teacher training in upper secondary education; (ii) help MOET develop \nthe  detailed  design  and  specifications  of  national  and  international  standards  focusing  on \nfacilities  and  equipment  in  upper  secondary  schools  including  nonpublic  schools;  and  (iii) \nprovide project management, implementation, and monitoring support to assist the start-up of \nthe USEDP. Key outputs will include (i) the strengthened capacity of MOET, DOETs, and other \nentities to renovate curricula, textbooks, and related in-service training; (ii) core trainers trained \nin delivering in-service teacher training on the new, diversified curricula and textbooks using \nactive learning approaches; (iii) upgraded capability of MOET in designing the details of facilities \nand equipment required for upper secondary schools with national and international standards; \nand (iv) improved capability of key MOET personnel involved in the start-up of the USEDP on  \nproject management, implementation, and monitoring. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n       \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will undertake the following activities: (i) conduct the capacity diagnosis and \nassess the baseline training needs for managing upper secondary education reform in the 11 \nprovinces selected for trying out the new, diversified curricula and textbooks; (ii) provide short-\nterm overseas (regional) training on project management, implementation, and monitoring, and \nregarding upper secondary schools with international standards; (iii) provide in-country training \nfor  diversified  upper  secondary  curricula  using  active  learning  approaches,  and  the \nmanagement of school facilities and equipment development; (iv) prepare a detailed design of \nfacilities and equipment for upper secondary schools to achieve national and international \nstandards; and (v) support for the strengthening of the project management, implementation, \nand monitoring capacity for the USEDP, including preparing the procurement plan for the first \nyear of USEDP implementation and the development of annual project monitoring and review \nmechanisms.  \n \n10.  The TA is to be implemented for about 12 months, from July 2003 to June 2004, and in \nthree phases. The first phase (6 weeks) will start with the capacity diagnosis and assessment of \nbaseline training needs. Based on interim results, (i) core trainers will be trained to deliver in-", "4 \nservice teacher training for trying out the new, diversified curricula and textbooks; and (ii) \noverseas study visits and training will be arranged, for helping upper secondary schools meet \ninternational standards. The first phase will also include the following: (i) An initial workshop will \nbe held during the second week of the TA, to brief MOET and concerned government agencies \nincluding the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Investment, Government Office, and \nState Bank of Viet Nam on the TA\u2019s objective, scope, and activities. (ii) An inception seminar will \nbe held during the fourth week of the TA, to confirm approaches and methodologies to be used, \ndiscuss  the  issues  to  be  addressed,  and  ensure  close  coordination  throughout  the  TA \nimplementation period among stakeholders (including representatives from the  11 selected \nprovinces [para. 4]). The seminar will result in an inception report to be submitted to the \nGovernment and ADB by the end of the sixth week of the TA.   \n \n11.  At the beginning of the second phase (a total of 32 weeks including a break), the \noverseas study visits and training will take place, and be evaluated by the training participants. \nIn collaboration with core trainers, in-country training will be provided for school administrators \nand in-service teachers involved in trying out the new, diversified curricula and textbooks for \ngrade 10. In addition, the second phase will produce (i) the results of the capacity diagnosis and \nbaseline training needs assessment, (ii) the detailed design of facilities and equipment for upper \nsecondary schools with national and international standards, (iii) the procurement plan of the \nfirst  year  of  USEDP  implementation,  and  (iv)  a  midterm  report  to  be  submitted  to  the \nGovernment and ADB and presented at a midterm seminar during week 18 of the TA. During a \nbreak of 20 weeks, in-country training will be conducted regarding (i) national and internal \nstandards  for  facilities  and  equipment  for  upper  secondary  schools;  and  (ii)  project \nmanagement, implementation, and monitoring. The training will be evaluated by the participants. \nThe  third  phase  (10  weeks)  will  start  with  the  submission  of  the  draft  final  report  to  the \nGovernment and ADB at 39 weeks of the TA. A final seminar will be convened after 45 weeks of \nthe TA in conjunction with a tripartite review meeting of the TA. The consultants will have 3 \nweeks to finalize the report, which will detail all the TA outputs, including those presented in the \nmidterm report, additional outputs, and training evaluations.  \n \n12.  Major assumptions and risks that need to be considered include the Government\u2019s \ncommitment to (i) expand access to diversified upper secondary education as an education \nsector policy goal; and (ii) maintain the high priority of improving the quality of upper secondary \neducation through (a) diversified curricula and textbooks, and related in-service teacher training \nusing active learning approaches, and (b) the development of school facilities and equipment.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent, of which $248,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $252,000 equivalent is the local currency cost.  The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $400,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost of \n$248,000 and $152,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. The TA will be financed by ADB \non a grant basis from the ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government of Viet Nam will finance \nthe remaining $100,000 equivalent of local currency costs, mainly through contributions in kind \nfor  office  accommodation,  counterpart  staff,  administrative  and  logistic  support,  and  other \nrelated services. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  MOET will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The TA will be implemented by three \ninternational and four domestic consultants who will provide 8 person-months of international ", "    5 \nand 20 person-months of domestic specialist services. The services of all the consultants will be \nengaged through a firm, using the quality- and cost-based selection and a simplified technical \nproposal procedure in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The \ninternational consultants will consist of (i) the team leader, a capacity-building specialist in \nsecondary education management and quality improvement (4 person-months); (ii) a school \nfacilities  and  equipment  development  specialist  (2.5  person-months);  and  (iii)  a  project \nmanagement, implementation, and monitoring specialist (1.5 person-months). The domestic \nconsultants will consist of (i) a training specialist in secondary education  (8 person-months); (ii) \nan institutional diagnosis and training needs assessment specialist (3 person-months), (iii) a \nschool facilities and equipment development  expert  (5 person-months), and (iv) a financial \nmanagement  and  procurement  planning  specialist  (4  person-months).  Outline  terms  of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The Government will provide a suitably qualified \ncounterpart team of at least three staff to assist the international consultants with all aspects, \nincluding establishing liaison with concerned agencies and institutions, and obtaining necessary \ndata and information required. Office equipment needed to implement the TA will be procured \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n15.  The TA activities will be based in MOET. A national project implementation unit of the \nUSEDP will be assigned to manage the TA as the project management unit (PMU). The PMU \nwill guide, facilitate, monitor, and assess the work of the consultants, and supervise the conduct \nof in-country training activities. The PMU will include the following members of the national \nproject implementation unit of the USEDP: a project manager, a deputy project manager, and \nsix  specialists  for  administration  and  finance,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  civil  works, \nprocurement,  textbook  development,  and  staff  development.  The  PMU  members  will  also \ncomprise (i) representatives from relevant MOET units, including the departments of planning \nand finance, international relations, secondary education, and teachers; and (ii) representatives \nfrom DOETs in the 11 selected provinces. A steering committee for the TA, the same as that for \nthe USEDP and chaired by the vice minister of MOET, will be set up to provide overall guidance \nto the PMU and ensure coordination with the concerned government agencies, including the \nMinistry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Investment, Government Office, and State Bank of \nViet Nam. The PMU\u2019s project manager will be a standing member of the steering committee.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for Capacity Building for Upper Secondary Education, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Risks/Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets \n1.
