THE PROPOSAL \n \n  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Indonesia for the additional financing of the State Accountability Revitalization \nProject. \n \n  The additional financing will extend and help sustain the benefits of the ongoing project1 \nto further improve the government\u2019s accountability for public expenditure. The additional financing \nwill (i) train and certify an additional 19,400 government internal auditors and public finance \nofficers at the central and local levels; 2 (ii) support the sustainability of a competency- and needs-\nbased e-learning training approach (within the framework of a national training institute) by further \nupgrading training systems and providing modern facilities adapted to e-learning (including \ntraining centers in four regional locations); and (iii) develop fully integrated systems for financial \nmanagement reporting and supervision in line with the national e-government strategy, adoption \nof continuous audit and continuous monitoring (CA/CM), implementation of a risk management \napproach for internal audit, and provision of training to 12,500 system users.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n  Indonesia\u2019s annual gross domestic product growth has consistently averaged around \n5.0% during the past five years, and the country has achieved steady poverty reduction over the \nsame period with its national poverty rate declining from 11.3% in 2014 to 9.7% in 2018. Yet, as \nnoted in the sector assessment,3 to maintain the momentum of its development efforts and at the \nsame time realize the development outcomes under the National Medium-Term Development \nPlan (RPJMN), 2015\u201320194 and the Sustainable Development Goals, enhancing the quality of \nthe public spending is critical. Indonesia\u2019s 2017 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability \n(PEFA) Assessment Report outlines areas where Indonesia\u2019s public financial management (PFM) \nsystem needs to improve if poverty and inequality, particularly in access to public services, are to \nbe further reduced. The lack of accountability at different levels of the government, including at \ndecentralized tiers in provinces and districts, causes inefficiency, budget inconsistencies, and \npossible mis-utilization of public funds. The proposed additional financing, building on the good \nprogress made under the ongoing project, will further support the Government of Indonesia\u2019s \nreform priorities in the PFM sector. \n \n  Ongoing project. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the ongoing project on \n31 October 2012, financed by a loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources in the amount of \n$57.75 million. The loan became effective on 19 February 2013. The ongoing project has three \nmain outputs: (i) capacity development for government internal auditors and public finance \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the State Accountability Revitalization Project. Manila. \n2  In seeking to improve the quality of internal audit, the ongoing project has focused its capacity building efforts on two \ngroups: government internal auditors and public finance officers. The need to improve the skills and competency of \ninternal auditors is self-evident, but one particular strength of the ongoing project is that it seeks to simultaneously \nimprove the ability of public finance officers to prepare financial statements of public expenditures that meet audit \nstandards. This twin-track approach will continue under the proposed additional financing. Another important element \nof the ongoing project approach, especially given Indonesia\u2019s decentralized form of government, is strengthening \ncapacity at the local government level, which will also be continued and expanded under the additional financing. \n3  Sector Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4  Government of Indonesia, National Development Planning Agency. National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015-\n2019. Jakarta. \n \n ", "2 \nofficers;  (ii)  development  of  e-learning  system  and  training  modules;  and  (iii)  institutional \nstrengthening through system improvement. \n  \n  The ongoing project is evaluated as performing well based on the following criteria:5 \n \n(i)  Implementation progress performance is rated on track. As of 31 May 2019 (89% \nof the  elapsed time), the  ongoing  project\u2019s  physical  progress  was  98%  with \ncumulative contract awards and disbursements at 98.9% of the loan amount. \n \n(ii)  There is full compliance with the safeguard covenants. The ongoing project is \ncategory  C  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples, with no safeguard impacts. \n \n(iii)  Delivery  of  expected  outputs  is rated  successful. Most  output targets  of  the \nongoing project have been exceeded. Under output 1, 3,442 government internal \nauditors and public finance officers graduated with degrees against the target of \n2,500 (44% were women against the target of 30%).6 A total of 22,213 participants \nreceived nondegree training, far exceeding the target of 9,800 (female participation \nin nondegree training was 40%, also exceeding the 30% target). Under output 2, \ne-learning system has been in operation with a total of 39 e-learning and 88 \nblended training modules developed and used, covering both functional auditor \ncertification  training  and  technical  training.  Eight  centers  of  excellence  were \ncreated in universities against the target of 14.7 The remaining six centers are \nexpected to be achieved under the additional financing. Under output 3, the \ndevelopment  of  a  management  information  system  on  accountability  has \nintegrated supervision planning, implementation, and reporting systems of the \nexecuting agency, the Central Government Internal Auditor (BPKP). \n \n(iv)  Management of risks is rated successful. The ongoing project has successfully \nmanaged the risks identified during project preparation, and there have been no \nsubstantial issues during implementation. \n \n  Need for upskilling internal auditors and public finance officers who are yet to \nbenefit from training. The ongoing project has demonstrated considerable success in upskilling \npublic  internal  auditors  and  finance  officers  for  better  PFM  thereby  contributing  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s overall accountability revitalization agenda. This is reflected in the increased quality \nof audit opinions from the Supreme Audit Board. During the period covered by RPJMN, 2015\u2013\n2019 the share of unqualified audit opinions reached 91% for the central government and 74% \nfor local governments. This is a substantial improvement from 10 years earlier, when fewer than \nhalf of audit opinions were recognized as being fairly and appropriately presented. For the \nforthcoming RPJMN, 2020\u20132024, the government plans to increase the share of unqualified audit \nopinions to 97% for the central government and provincial governments, and 90% for district \ngovernments. To meet these targets, BPKP estimates that additional 46,560 certified government \ninternal  auditors  are  needed.  As  of  May  2019,  however,  there  were  only  13,749  certified \ngovernment internal auditors, of which about 8,450 were certified under the ongoing project. \nRecognizing the project\u2019s success to date, the government wishes to extend the training to a \n \n5  Summary of Project Performance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  Government of Indonesia, Central Government Internal Auditor (BPKP). 2018. Draft Project Completion Report: State \nAccountability Revitalization Project. Jakarta. \n7  The ongoing project did not fully achieve the target because there were only eight leading universities that met the \nreadiness criteria set by BPKP. The additional financing will support additional six universities to meet the readiness \ncriteria.    \n ", "3 \nmuch larger group of internal auditors and finance officers to ensure its RPJMN targets are met. \nThe government also wishes to make the new approach to training provision more decentralized \nand sustainable. The proposed additional financing will support the government\u2019s efforts to fill this \ngap in training and certification for government internal auditors and public finance officers. The \ntraining funded by the project is part of a major push by the government to comprehensively \nupgrade the standard of internal audit and the quality of financial reports on public expenditure. \nSince this is a non-routine skills upgrading over a limited period, the government will continue to \nborrow significantly more than the ongoing project for this major capacity enhancement exercise. \nRegular in-service training is budgeted annually. \n \n  Need for integrated systems. An upgrading of the FMISs is also needed to enhance the \nprocessing efficiency and accuracy of financial statements, and the timeliness of the submission \nof financial statements to the Supreme Audit Board. Based on government regulation on regional \nfinancial management, the government will require local governments\u2019 FMISs to be integrated \nwith  other  systems  to  support  harmonization  of  data  systems  in  the  context  of  fiscal \ndecentralization. This activity is not part of the ongoing project, but will be addressed under the \nadditional financing. Currently, more than 30 different FMISs are being used by 542 local \ngovernments to manage budget planning, execution, accounting, reporting, and other functions. \nThere are three main systems in use, but they, as well as other lesser-used FMISs, operate as \nstand-alone systems. Thus, district-level, province-level, and national-level consolidation and \nmonitoring of both financial and nonfinancial data rely on manual transfer with all the attendant \nrisks and time delays. Additionally, reporting entities do not use a standard chart of accounts, and \nproblems arise with varying data structures and definitions, as each local government defines its \nown  coding  structure.  Effective  uptake  of  an  integrated  system  will  require  upskilling  of \ngovernment officials.  \n \n  Government  policy.  The  forthcoming  RPJMN,  2020\u20132024  is  expected  to  promote \nbureaucratic institutional reform through several mechanisms, including improving performance \naccountability and supervision capacities. Focus will be given to utilization of information and \ncommunication technology to improve transparency, accuracy, accountability, and public service \ndelivery. This will involve strengthening the government\u2019s goods and services procurement \nsystem, as well as upgrading and supporting the rollout of the Government Internal Control \nSystem (GICS). The proposed additional financing will support the implementation of the GICS to \nachieve the maturity index of level 3 by 100% for all central line ministries and local governments \nby 2024 as set in the RPJMN, 2020-2024.8  \n \n  The 2017 PEFA Assessment Report found that, while the internal control function is \nadequately defined in the legal and regulatory framework, the country\u2019s FMIS is not sufficiently \nintegrated with other PFM systems.9 In addition, internal audit plans and reports are implemented, \nbut findings are not followed up on in a consistent and effective manner. The PEFA assessment \nreport highlighted areas for improvement, including conforming with standards outlined in the \nInstitute of Internal Auditors\u2019 international professional practices framework.10 The report also \nstressed a need to (i) address strategic issues relating to governance, risk management, and \ncontrol processes in cross-sector and government-wide programs; and (ii) build certification \n \n8  BPKP is using a maturity model with five levels of index (from 1 to 5) to measure the maturity of the GICS \nimplementation.  \n9  The 2017 PEFA assessment report for Indonesia covered 3 years (2014\u20132016) with a cutoff date of August 2017. A \nprior PEFA assessment was carried out in 2011, but a direct comparison of indicators and scores is not possible as \nthe framework and methodology changed twice in the intervening period. However, the 2017 report concluded that \nthe \u201cneedle has moved in the right direction.\u201d World Bank. 2018.

The proposed additional financing responds to these recommendations, \nand thereby supports institutional strengthening and contributes to improved sustainability of PFM \nin Indonesia.11 \n \n  Additional financing eligibility criteria. The additional financing meets ADB\u2019s eligibility \ncriteria for additional financing. The overall project (i) remains technically feasible, economically \nviable, and financially sound; (ii) is a high priority of the government;12 and (iii) is consistent with \nthe ongoing project\u2019s development objectives, the government\u2019s priorities, and ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for Indonesia, 2016\u20132019, under which ADB supports the government\u2019s \nefforts to foster good governance by improving financial accountability, with a focus on local \ngovernments.13 The overall project will contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 16 (peace, \njustice,  and  strong  institutions);  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  priority  6 \n(strengthening governance and institutional capacity);14 and supports the implementation of the \nSecond Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan (improving governance, and institutional and \ncorruption risks).15 The ongoing project is performing well, has been rated on track since its \ncommencement,  and  implementation  progress  and  results  are  satisfactory.  Safeguards \nrequirements have been complied with and risks have been adequately managed (para. 5). \n \n  ADB value addition. Development of e-learning under the ongoing project has proven to \nbe about 30% more efficient than traditional classroom training.16 The efficiency gains are \nexpected to be even greater with the new facilities and equipment to be provided under the \nadditional financing. These gains will allow BPKP to deliver more training for the same or less \nbudget. Training will also be better targeted to the individual needs of trainees and their host \norganizations: a learning value chain with a needs- and competency-based approach will move \nthe provision of training away from a one-size-fits-all model to a more customized one. This will \nensure a greater return from the expenditure on training. The innovative approach to training \ndelivery, especially for a decentralized form of government such as Indonesia\u2019s provides a \nsignificant demonstration effect. Further, the ongoing project has promoted trilateral cooperation \nbetween  BPKP,  local  governments,  and  universities  through  the  degree  program  and  the \nestablishment of centers of excellence at leading universities in providing PFM courses and \nresearch. This cooperation will continue to be supported under the additional financing. \n \n \n11  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix \n2). \n12 The government\u2019s request for assistance has been included in the List of Medium Term Planned External Loans and \nGrants of 2018 (also known as the Blue Book) and the List of Planned Priority External Loans of 2019 (also known \nas the Green Book) of the National Development Planning Agency.

In addition, the waiting time to enroll in a class has \nalso been significantly reduced, as the training center is able to conduct more courses. \n \n ", "5 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n  The project is aligned with the following impact: accountability of public institutions able to \ndeliver high-quality public services strengthened.17 The project will have the following outcome: \ncapacity of government internal auditors and public finance officers in budget planning, reporting, \ninternal audit, and asset management improved.18 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n  Output 1: Capacity of government internal auditors and public finance officers \ndeveloped. Under this output, the additional financing will allow BPKP to provide training and \ncertification to 19,400 government internal auditors and public finance officers at the central and \nlocal government levels. Specialized training will be provided for (i) substantive technical training \nin risk management, strategic audit, audit reporting, audit management, procurement audit, PFM \ntransactions in planning, budgeting, accounting, procurement, asset management, and financial \nreporting; and (ii) nonmandatory certification in internal auditing, fraud prevention, and accounting. \nTraining in financial reporting and auditing will also be provided to public finance officers involved \nin development partner-funded projects. \n \n  Output 2: Competency- and needs-based e-learning approach institutionalized. \nUnder this output, the additional financing will help BPKP reorient and reequip its existing training \ninstitute (the government internal auditor corporate university), providing it with new fully equipped \nfacilities at four regional hubs (Bali, Bogor, Makassar, and Medan) for the production and delivery \nof e-learning courses. As part of the reorientation, the training institute will adopt a competency- \nand needs-based approach. Under this new approach, job models (using the integrated talent \nmanagement system developed under the ongoing project) will be established for the various \nlevels of internal auditors and public finance officers and learning road maps will be produced for \neach position in line with the needs of the trainee\u2019s organization. \n \n  Output 3: Audit and financial management information systems improved. Under \nthis output, the additional financing will upgrade the existing BPKP-developed local government \nFMIS, the Regional Financial Management Information System (SIMDA), to meet regulatory and \ntechnology requirements for e-government and to be fully integrated across planning, budgeting, \nreporting, auditing, and monitoring. Also, as part of this output, a CA/CM information system will \nbe embedded in the BPKP-developed FMIS. The CA/CM information system will enhance the \ncapabilities of internal auditors by allowing them to determine their audit approaches on a \ncontinuous basis; promote compliance with policies, procedures, and regulations; and monitor the \nstatus of, and follow up on, audit finds by the external auditor. BPKP will also develop risk \nassessment tools under this project to ensure that audits are carried out in the areas of greatest \nrisk. In addition to the training under output 1, training associated with the rollout of various \nsystems developed under this output will also be carried out and provided to 12,500 system users. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n  The project is estimated to cost $104.92 million, of which $90 million is proposed to be \nfinanced by a regular loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (Table 1).

Implementation Arrangements \n \n  The implementation arrangements, including BPKP as the executing agency, will remain \nunchanged from the ongoing project. BPKP has performed well in this role. The head of the \nBureau of Performance Management, Organization, and Governance (previously known as the \nBureau for Audit Planning) under BPKP will continue to head the project management unit. A \nproject implementing unit will be set up in the BPKP\u2019s Training and Education Center to be \nresponsible for implementing activities under outputs 1 and 2, while the BPKP\u2019s Directorate for \nRegional Financial Management II will be responsible for implementing activities under output 3. \n \n  The additional financing will be implemented from 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2025. Based \non the list of activities identified, the project will require a project management consulting firm to \nsupport the executing agency during implementation (as is the case for the ongoing project), \nwhich will minimally include a team of specialists for training, financial management, procurement, \nand monitoring and evaluation. Table 3 presents the implementation arrangements, which are \ndescribed in detail in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  1 April 2020\u201331 March 2025 \nEstimated completion date  31 March 2025 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 September 2025 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Steering committee \nPrincipal secretary, BPKP (chair) \nRelevant directors from BPKP, MOF, MOHA, and BAPPENAS (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  BPKP \n(iii)  Key implementation units  Project management unit (Bureau of Performance Management, \nOrganization, and Governance), BPKP, 10 staff \nBPKP Training and Education Center, 10 staff, \nBPKP Directorate of Regional Financial Management II, 5 staff \nProcurement  National competitive  Multiple contracts  $26,000,000 \nbidding \nShopping  1 contract  $100,000 \nConsulting services  QCBS  Multiple contracts  $15,400,000 \n(4,590 person-months) \nAdvance contracting  Project management consultant (QCBS, 1,300 person-months, $5,200,000); \nengineering management consultant for building construction (QCBS, 160 \nperson-months, $640,000) \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BAPPENAS = Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional (National Development \nPlanning Agency), BPKP = Badan Pengawasan Keuangan dan Pembangunan (Central Government Internal Auditor), \nMOF = Ministry of Finance, MOHA = Ministry of Home Affairs, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: ADB. \n  \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n \n  The additional financing will allow BPKP to upgrade SIMDA and other FMISs to enable \ninteroperability and to link to the central government system, including for budget reconciliation \npurposes. It will also provide significant technical improvements through the adoption of standard \nchart of accounts. An assessment of technical viability will be conducted during system design, \ntaking into account the standardization of budget classification and/or chart of accounts and \n ", "8 \nbusiness processes mandated by the Ministry of Finance. A review of available infrastructure and \ntechnology, and compatibility with other FMISs will be undertaken prior to system installation and \nimplementation. Training will be provided to local government officials for system operation and \nmaintenance. \n \n  The project will address important sector weaknesses identified by the PEFA assessment \n(para. 9), particularly by raising the standards of internal audit to move beyond simple compliance \nchecks to the identification and addressing of systemic risks, and the quality of internal control \nmechanisms supported by information systems. The CA/CM to be developed under output 3 will \nhelp internal audit offices to monitor the status of audit findings follow-up. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n  The economic rationale for the project rests largely on promoting good governance \nthrough stronger capacity of public internal auditors and finance officers. Good governance will \nprovide efficient and effective use of state funds for better public service delivery, which will \nimprove the well-being of the population and be of development benefit to the nation. Budget \nleakages across governments in the country are expected to be reduced through improved \ncompetency  of  public  internal  auditors  and  finance  officers.  Improved  governance  and \ntransparency will also improve investor confidence, which will improve the country\u2019s credit rating.20 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n  The training provided under the project is part of a major push by the government to \ncomprehensively upgrade the capacity of its internal auditors and the public finance officers who \nprepare reports on financial expenditure, which are the basis for internal audit. This major \nupskilling exercise requires resources far in excess of those for regular in-service training. Once \nthis one-time upgrade of skills is complete, the budget for training of the various agencies involved \nis expected to be sufficient to train new recruits and provide regular in-service training to existing \nstaff, without recourse to external assistance. Sustainability for the provision of training in the \nfuture will also be ensured by moving BPKP to a more efficient model of training delivery, including \nthrough the widespread adoption of e-learning and closely aligning training provision to training \nneeds. Provision of new facilities appropriate for the new learning approach within the framework \nof the national government internal audit training institute, together with improved facilities in the \nregional hubs in Bali, Bogor, Makassar, and Medan, will also improve efficiency in training \nprovision. In addition, and in accordance with Government Regulation No. 20/2014,21 BPKP is \nable  to  apply  fees  and  charges  for  the  training  it  provides.22 This  will  further  ensure  the \nsustainability of the program. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n  Project-specific governance risks were identified through the financial management and \nprocurement assessments of BPKP. 23 Under the ongoing project, BPKP has been performing \nsatisfactorily in handling financial management and procurement as shown by the on track rating \nof the ongoing project. BPKP has good financial management capacity and is responsible for \nsetting the benchmark for good financial management for other government bodies. All BPKP \nstaff at the project management unit, project implementing units, as well as the procurement \n \n20 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 This regulation outlines the nontax revenues that BPKP is allowed to collect. \n22 The nontax revenue collected by BPKP from 2014 to 2018 is in the Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible \nfrom the list of the linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of link documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \ncommittee, hold at the minimum a diploma in accounting. BPKP has sufficient capacity, staffing, \nand systems to undertake financial, accounting, and procurement functions; and proven capacity \nto manage project implementation, financial management, and procurement in accordance with \nADB policies and requirements. The overall fiduciary risks before mitigation measures are \nmoderate. Any new staff unfamiliar with ADB procedures will be provided training on ADB project \nmanagement, administration, procurement, and disbursement. \n \n  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and BPKP. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 19). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n  In preparation for the additional financing, the analysis and activities in the summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy of the ongoing project have been updated and extended to \ncover the scope of the additional financing.24 The overall project has been designed to support \nIndonesia\u2019s poverty reduction goals through improved accountability of public institutions in \nmanaging state funds. An internal audit function that is risk-based and meets international \nstandards will provide more effective checks on public expenditure and, together with greater \ntransparency and follow-up, will improve the delivery of basic public services to the poor. This will \nalso enhance public confidence in the government. \n \n  The project has some gender elements, as it targets women\u2019s participation in the training \nand certification programs supported by the project. The ongoing project targets 30% participation \nby women in training. Under the additional financing, the target will be raised to 40% women \nparticipants in aggregate. There are fewer female internal auditors than males in the country \nbecause of prior unequal access to education and training by women. On average, female internal \nauditors from 2012 to 2019 comprise only 40% of the total number of auditors nationwide. The \noverall project will include sex-disaggregated data in the monitoring and evaluation system to help \nachieve the women representation target. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the ongoing project was \nclassified category C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples as it only involved capacity building and software development activities. The additional \nfinancing will provide minor construction of the BPKP\u2019s regional training hubs in Bali, Bogor, \nMakassar, and Medan on existing government land. Land acquisition and resettlement are not \nexpected. The project is not expected to affect indigenous peoples. There will be some minor \nenvironmental  impacts  during  construction.  These  will  be  addressed  through  a  code  of \nconstruction practice, to be complied with by the works contractor. Overall, under the additional \nfinancing, the project is expected to maintain its category C rating for impacts on the environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nG.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.25 \n \n \n \n24 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe timing of standardization of charts of  Consultation, and communication, and participation of BPKP in \naccounts may not be in line with the upgrading  the central government\u2019s task force on standardization of chart of \nof the BPKP-developed FMIS, which may  accounts. \ndelay the upgrading \nDelays in decision-making by the government  Close monitoring, consultation, communication, and participation \non the harmonization of local government  of BPKP in the central government\u2019s task force on harmonization \nFMISs and/or a decision to opt for a single  of systems.

ASSURANCES \n \n  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, \nprocurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan \ndocuments. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $90,000,000 \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the additional financing of the State Accountability Revitalization \nProject, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term \nof 17.5 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n7 November 2019 \n \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nREVISED DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nOngoing project \nAccountability of public institutions able to deliver high-quality public services strengthened (National Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan, 2015\u20132019; forthcoming National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2020-2024)a  \n \nOverall project \nUnchanged \n  Data Sources and \nPerformance Indicators with Targets  Reporting \nResults Chain  and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nOngoing project  Ongoing project   \nCapacity of  By 2017   \ngovernment internal  a.
