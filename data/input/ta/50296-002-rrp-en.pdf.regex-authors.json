THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Skills Training and Education Pathways Upgradation Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will support the government in expanding and upgrading the technical and \nvocational education and training (TVET) system for modern, diversified, and job-oriented skills \ndevelopment. Bhutan, a landlocked country with a population of 780,000, has made great strides \nin basic education, and it now needs to accelerate the development of a skilled workforce to meet \nthe economic needs for competitiveness and sustained growth. Bhutan\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, \n2018\u20132023 prioritizes skills development for jobs.2 \n  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Bhutan made impressive progress in socioeconomic development over 2007\u20132017. Its \neconomy grew at an average annual rate of 7.7% during this period.3 The country doubled its per \ncapita gross domestic product and halved the poverty rate.4 However, such rapid development \nwas largely driven by the capital-intensive hydropower sector and did not lead to adequate job \ncreation.  Economic diversification and job creation are among the top priorities of the government. \n \n4.  Bhutan faces high youth unemployment. The youth unemployment rate of 13.2% in 2016 \nwas 6 times the average national unemployment rate and has been rising in recent years.5 At the \nsame time, employers find it difficult to recruit skilled workers. Skills shortages are one of the \ncritical constraints to the growth of the private sector and diversification of the economy.6 \nAccording to the National Workforce Plan, 2016\u20132022, based on a survey of employers in three \npriority sectors (construction, tourism, and production), more than 33% of employers face skills \nshortages, impacting on productivity and business performance.7 The National Workforce Plan \nestimates that 78,000 jobs will be generated by the construction, tourism, and manufacturing \nsectors during 2016\u20132022. In 2017, over 14,000 new secondary and tertiary education graduates \nentered the labor market. Equipping these new graduates with market-oriented skills needed by \nindustry will help reduce the skills shortages. \n \n5.  Challenges in skills development. The skills development system in Bhutan faces \nconstraints in access. In 2016, only 6.9% of grade 10 students enrolled in TVET. The current \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided $425,000 in project preparatory technical assistance.

Thimphu.  \n ", "2   \nannual intake capacity of the public technical training institutes (TTIs) is limited, catering to only \nabout 635 students, compared to 3,000 grade 10 graduates and nearly 6,000 grade 12 graduates \nentering the workforce in 2016.8 Outdated equipment in TTIs is in dire need of replacement. \nTrainers  lack  capacity and  professional  development. The TTIs  offer courses  at the  basic \ncertificate level and in traditional areas (e.g., electrical, mechanical, welding, automobile, masonry, \nplumbing,  and  carpentry).  These  are  not preferred  by  youth  mainly  due  to  lack  of  career \nprogression and low social recognition. Opportunities for skills upgrading through advanced \ncourses will lead to better job prospects. In addition, training is required for emerging occupations, \nincluding service sector jobs such as information technology (IT) and IT-enabled services, food \nand beverage, tourism and hospitality, and media and communication. Career guidance with \nexposure  to  the  world  of  work  to  school  students  will  increase  their  awareness  of  skills \ndevelopment opportunities leading to jobs. \n \n6.  Skills development in the country also faces the challenge of lack of quality and relevance. \nAn estimated 80% of training programs is delivered at the basic certificate level, which does not \ncommand much market value. There is a shortage of middle and advanced skills, with demand \nlargely met by foreign workers.  International collaborations in TVET will contribute to enhancing \nthe capacities of trainers. IT-based teaching and learning processes in schools and TTIs will help \nto prepare the youth for an increasingly digital marketplace. Schools are preponderantly geared \nto academic education without sufficient preparation for the world of work. Labor market surveys \nreveal that Bhutanese youth do not possess the skills that employers are looking for, which gives \nrise to skills mismatches. Partnerships with private sector training providers to deliver market-\nrelevant courses will help address such mismatches and improve job placements. \n \n7.  Opportunities in skills development. The government attaches great importance to \nskills development for jobs and is highly committed to improving the TVET sector. A number of \npolicy documents provide the basis for this. The TVET Blueprint, 2016\u20132026 articulates the vision \nfor improving and transforming the skills development system. The Education Blueprint, 2014\u2013\n2024 outlines priorities for enhancing education quality, including strengthening TVET in schools. \nThe Economic Development Policy of 2016 aims to diversify the economy, which requires \nappropriately skilled human capital.9 The government plans to expand capacities for TVET \nprovision, and raise the proportion of higher secondary students enrolling in TVET to 20% by 2024 \nfrom the current 6.9%. The government plans to offer more diversified learning opportunities \nincluding vocational training to secondary school students (grades 9\u201312).  \n \n8.  Prior experience of the Asian Development Bank. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhas  long-standing  experience  in  supporting  TVET  and  school  education  in  Bhutan.10 ADB \nfinanced the establishment of the TTIs, forming the backbone of public sector TVET institutions, \nunder the Basic Skills Development Project from 2001 to 2006. The validation report by ADB\u2019s \nIndependent Evaluation Department noted that the project was instrumental in skilling young labor \n                                                \n8   The total capacity of 635 is across all seven public TTIs in Bhutan. The project will cover five major TTIs.  \n9  The Economic Development Policy outlines the critical need for diversification beyond the hydropower sector.   \n10  Related ADB support includes the following: ADB. 1990.

ADB technical assistance (TA) helped to develop the TVET Blueprint, \nwhich provides the vision for reforms and targets in the TVET sector. The government asked ADB \nto support its implementation. \n \n9.  Value added by the Asian Development Bank\u2019s assistance. ADB is well placed to build \non past collaborations in TVET and school education. ADB\u2019s value addition will be to (i) help \nelevate standards in TTIs; (ii) provide green technology equipment for the delivery of existing and \nnew courses in the TTIs;12 (iii) assist the government in rebranding TVET courses to attract more \nyouth,  and  modernizing  teaching  and  training  pedagogy;  (iv)  strengthen  private  sector \nengagement in the delivery of courses that are in demand in the market; and (v) demonstrate \ngood practices in integrating TVET and career guidance in school education. The grant supports \nthe inclusive economic growth pillar of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 and is fully \naligned with the government\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan.13 ADB support is crucial to augment the \nfinancial and technical capacity of the government to implement the TVET Blueprint. ADB will \nenable a knowledge sharing forum to bring together key agencies such as Helvetas, the World \nBank, the government of Australia, and the Japan International Cooperation Agency to synergize \nsupport for TVET, labor market analysis, and capacity development. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: skilled human capital for equitable \nsocioeconomic development increased. The project will have the following outcome: employability \nof TVET graduates and secondary school graduates improved.14 \n  \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  Output  1:  Access  to  skills  development  increased.  The  capacity  of  five  TTIs \nparticipating in the project to enroll students for skills training will nearly double by 2023.15 The \nTTIs  will  venture  into  training  for  emerging  occupations  by  introducing  additional  courses. \nSpecifically, the project will (i) establish a new flagship TTI in Thimphu in a new campus with \nmodern facilities and upgraded courses at the diploma level, and improve the TTI in Samthang \nwith new classrooms, workshops, and dormitories; (ii) provide green technology equipment and \ntools, including IT equipment, in the five TTIs; and (iii) introduce at least six new courses, including \nat the middle and advanced (diploma) levels and in new disciplines.16 These much-needed \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2010. Completion Report: Basic Skills Development Project in Bhutan. Manila; and Independent Evaluation \nDepartment. 2011. Validation Report: Basic Skills Development Project in Bhutan. Manila. The overall performance \nof the Basic Skills Development Project was rated partly successful, as some of the outputs were only partially \nachieved and the design of project management was fragmented. \n12  Green technology equipment includes Computer Numerical Control machines, three-dimensional workstations for \nsimulation and virtual welders, that will consume less electricity and raw materials. The simulators will supplement \ntheoretical and classroom teaching prior to practice on real machines.  \n13  ADB. 2014. Country Partnership Strategy: Bhutan, 2014\u20132018. Manila. \n14  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n15  The annual enrollment capacity in the TTIs in Chumey, Khuruthang, Rangjung, Samthang and Thimphu will increase \nfrom 466 in 2017 to 919 in 2023 \n16  Diploma courses will be introduced for the first time in the TTIs. The project will introduce national diploma courses \nin electrical and construction technology; National Certificate Level 3 courses in welding and hybrid automobiles; \nand courses in diversified disciplines, including computer applications (graphic design and animation), logistics, and \npackaging and food production.   \n \n ", "4   \ninvestments will enable the enrollment of a larger cohort of students in the TTIs as per the TVET \nBlueprint. This output will benefit a total of 2,200 students in TTIs over 5 years, including an \nadditional 450 students enrolled during the project period (32% female). Increasing access to \nTVET for women will increase gender equality in workforce participation and wage rates. The \nintroduction of advanced courses will raise the workforce skill level and support the economy\u2019s \nefforts to move up the value chain in the industry and service sectors.17 \n \n12.  Output 2: Quality and relevance of skills development enhanced. To enhance the \nquality and market relevance of TVET, the project will (i) deliver training of trainer programs to at \nleast 60% of trainers in TTIs, offering exposure to training practices by leading regional and/or \ninternational TVET institutions, and workplace experience; (ii) deliver skills training in emerging \noccupations in partnership with private sector training providers and civil society organizations, \nbenefiting  800  students  (32%  female and  5%  persons  with  disabilities)18;  and  (iii)  provide \nimproved teaching and learning resources, including e-resources, in the five TTIs to develop \nfuture-ready IT skills in graduates.19 The upgrading of the capacities of trainers will be undertaken \nin partnership with international institutions, particularly for the delivery of diploma courses with \ninnovative pedagogy. The project will establish new employment-linked contracts with private \nsector training providers based on a competitive selection process to assure better job outcomes. \nPartnerships with civil society organizations will increase opportunities for skills training for jobs \nor  self-employment  for  disadvantaged  youth,  particularly  those  with  disabilities.  Equal \nopportunities for women and disadvantaged youth to benefit from higher-quality skills training and \ntraining  in  emerging  occupations  will  lead  to  better  paid  jobs  and  economic  and  social \nempowerment. \n \n13.  Output  3:  Vocational  orientation  of  secondary  school  students  improved.  To \nencourage a larger number of secondary school students to take up skills training, the project will \nsupport the introduction of TVET elective subjects in seven pilot schools that will be upgraded as \n\u201cTVET premier schools\u201d. Specifically, the project will (i) improve the skills of secondary school \nstudents by offering TVET elective subjects in grades 9\u201312 in seven pilot schools linked to TTIs, \nbenefiting 400 students (32% female); (ii) provide career guidance with exposure to the world of \nwork to secondary students (grades 7\u201312) benefiting 30,000 students (40% female); and (iii) offer \ninformation and communication technology-enriched teaching and learning to improve modern \ncompetencies, such as critical thinking, problem solving, teamwork, and communication, in \ngrades 7\u201312 in the seven pilot schools, benefiting 2,500 students (40% female). These actions \nwill enable secondary school students, including girls, to make appropriate career choices for \nbetter job prospects. The project will establish 13 TVET laboratories in the seven pilot schools to \noffer TVET courses with a structured curriculum and trained junior instructors. The pilot schools \nwill have formal linkages with the five TTIs and one Institute of Zorig Chusum (a training institute \nfor traditional arts and crafts) for curriculum, teacher training, and credit transfer arrangements. \n \n14.  Output  4:  Governance  and  institutional  capacity  for  technical  and  vocational \neducation and training improved. The project will (i) operationalize an integrated and web-\nbased TVET management information system (MIS) and an employment services portal; and (ii) \nfacilitate international partnerships for capacity development in at least one TTI. Currently, there \nis no centralized information system to track the enrollment and progress of students across the \n                                                \n17  In 2016, industry accounted for 41% of gross domestic product; the service sector accounted for 42%; and \nagriculture, livestock, and forestry accounted for about 16%.  \n18  The private sector training providers will offer courses in tourism and hospitality, food processing and packaging, \nmultimedia, animation and communication, and other areas identified through ongoing needs assessment. \n19 The project will equip the TTIs with a range of e-resources, such as multimedia-based self-learning modules for \nvarious courses which will also inculcate problem solving and project-based learning. \n ", "5 \nTTIs. The new TVET MIS will provide sex-disaggregated data on TVET across the TTIs. An online \ncentral admissions system for the TTIs will be introduced. Timely and reliable information and \nforecasting in key areas of skills demand are needed for TVET providers to effectively develop \nthe required workforce. The MOLHR will host and operate the new TVET MIS and the employment \nservices portal and maintain it during project implementation and beyond. The project will support \ninitiatives to assess future demand. To prepare Bhutanese youth to be globally mobile and \ncompetitive, the project will pursue international collaborations and potential institutional twinning \nfor capacity development. \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n20.   The  project  has  strong  design  features  based  on  the  priorities  outlined  in  the \ngovernment\u2019s TVET Blueprint. The budget proposals for the Twelfth Five-Year Plan include \nprovisions for the project, including government counterpart contributions and budget allocation \nfor recurrent costs. The civil works in the project will adopt disaster risk resilient features and \ninclude energy-efficient equipment and fixtures. The equipment to be supplied to the TTIs will \nembody green technologies where possible. The MOLHR and MOE have adequate capacities to \nundertake curriculum revisions and develop materials and standards for the TVET courses in TTIs \nand in schools, which will be supplemented with international collaborations and TA. The project \nwill establish performance-based partnership agreements with private sector providers to deliver \nmarket-oriented skills training programs with extensive on-the-job training and job placements. \nThe private sector partnerships will extend skills training for fast-growing service sector jobs. The \nestablishment  of  an  online  TVET  MIS  including  an  online  student  admissions  system,  will \ncontribute to improving evidence-based planning and timely implementation. \n \n21.  Climate change. The project risk is rated medium on climate change based on ADB\u2019s \nclimate risk screening report.21 Adaptation measures like retaining walls, and mitigation measures, \nsuch as energy efficient lights and appliances, will be incorporated in the design of buildings to \nensure that they will be resistant to climate change. The associated carbon dioxide emission \nreductions from the proposed mitigation measures are estimated to be 114 tons per year. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  Economic  returns  from  the  project  will  be  derived  by  students  transitioning  into \nemployment after skills training at the TTIs, TVET premier schools, and on-the-job training in \nindustries, compared to nonparticipants. Industries and employers are expected to benefit from \nincreased availability of skilled workers. A larger number of TVET graduates will benefit from \nhigher wages compared to unskilled workers. The cumulative net incremental benefits  will \nbecome positive within 4 years of implementation. The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return \nis estimated at a high 19.28% which reflects extensive skills shortages that currently prevail in \nBhutan. Sensitivity analysis was carried out with a 20% reduction in quantified benefits and a 20% \nincrease in costs (capital and operations). The economic internal rate of return continued to be \nmore than 6%, indicating that the project is a sound investment. \n \n                                                \n21 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \n23.  The financial analysis assessed the sustainability of the project at the national and project \nlevels. It assessed the government\u2019s capacity and commitment to provide adequate financial \nsupport to implement the project and mainstream it after project  completion. The analysis \nconcluded that the government has the capacity to absorb and sustain the benefits of the project \nconsidering the increased budget allocations proposed for the TVET and school education \nsubsectors in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  ADB undertook a detailed financial management capacity assessment of the MOLHR and \nMOE. Bhutan has made exemplary progress in building its public financial management system \nto provide fiscal discipline and rational allocation of resources in line with its five-year plans. The \ngovernment is pursuing further improvements through the Public Financial Management Reform \nStrategy, 2017\u20132021 to improve transparency and accountability.22 Despite strong systems, \nproject financial management risk, prior to mitigation is rated substantial primarily because of \ninadequate capacity for financial management, internal controls on compliance with procedures, \ncontrol over fixed assets, and timely follow-up on internal and external audits. Mitigation measures \ninclude the appointment of full-time financial management personnel in the PMUs (supported by \nfinancial management consultants), and improved financial monitoring and asset management \ncontrols. The internal audit teams of the respective ministries will present half-yearly internal audit \nreports to the steering committee. An annual statutory external audit report will be submitted within \n6 months of the end of the government financial year. \n \n25.  ADB undertook a procurement risk assessment at the country and TVET sector levels. \nWhile the procurement system has several strong features such as e-procurement, there are \ninstitutional weaknesses in linking procurement planning, budget provisions and fund release, \nand  capacity  constraints  for  timely  procurement  management  and  monitoring.  Mitigation \nmeasures include dedicated full-time procurement staff in the PMUs, supported by intermittent \nprocurement management consultants. A design and supervision consultant will be engaged to \nmonitor all the civil works in the project. ADB will undertake two external fiduciary reviews covering \nfinancial management processes and selected post procurement audits. After mitigation, the \nproject\u2019s financial management and procurement risks are moderate. The detailed risk mitigation \nplan is included in the PAM. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOLHR  and  MOE.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM.23 \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  The project has pro-poor and gender-sensitive dimensions. The main beneficiaries will be \nthe youth who have completed grade 10 and can pursue job-oriented skills development. The \nproject provides opportunities to rural youth.24 The majority of students taking up TVET come from \n                                                \n22 Government of Bhutan, Ministry of Finance. 2017. Public Financial Management Reforms Strategy, 2017\u20132021. \nThimphu. \n23  The Anticorruption Commission of Bhutan is currently investigating some of the MOLHR\u2019s training programs. The \nMOLHR will provide an action plan on the findings when the inquiry has been completed. \n24  The five TTIs participating in the project are located in the far east (Rangjung), in the central region (Chumey), in the \nwest (Khuruthang and Samthang), and in the capital city of Thimphu. All TTIs offer free training and free residential \nfacilities, ensuring affordability of training for members of poor communities. \n \n ", "9 \nfamilies in which the head of household has little or no education and comes from an agro-farming \nbackground.25 The government is proactively tackling the issue of unemployment among youth, \nwho are currently recognized as a vulnerable group in Bhutan.26 The project will offer affordable \nskills training programs to poor youth while also providing skills upgradation to workers through \ndiploma courses which will enable them to access better paid jobs. \n \n28.  Female secondary school students and TVET trainees will benefit from skills development \nand career counseling. In line with the target to increase female enrollment in TTIs, 32% of \nresidential facilities will be reserved for female students. Training delivery through private sector \ntraining providers includes mandatory targets for females and people with disabilities. Media \ncampaigns and advocacy will be undertaken to encourage poor and female students to avail of \nfree TVET opportunities, and break gender stereotypes. While the project will support participation \nof women in courses that are popular among females (such as tourism and hospitality, tailoring \nand/or dressmaking, food packaging, IT and IT-enabled services, design, and animation), it will \nalso encourage women to take up male-dominated courses in sectors such as automotive and \nconstruction based on interest and job market demand. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.27 \n \n30.  Environment (category B). Potential impacts are mainly associated with construction of \nnew buildings for TTIs and include increased noise and dust levels, waste generation, and traffic \ncongestion. These impacts are temporary and of short duration and can be mitigated through the \nenvironmental management plan, environmental monitoring plan, and compliance with relevant \ngovernment regulations. The initial environmental examination was disclosed on the ADB website \non 15 June 2018. An environment safeguard specialist will monitor and report on compliance with \nADB  environmental  requirements  during  implementation.  The  PMUs  will  set  up  a  project \ngrievance redress mechanism to resolve complaints in a timely manner. Consultations with \nstakeholders were undertaken during project preparation. \n \n31.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  entails  no  land  acquisition, \nresettlement,  or  any  physical  and  economic  displacement.  Improvements  to  buildings  and \nfacilities will take place within existing campuses and/or premises owned by the government. \n \n32.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  Bhutan  does  not  have  any  officially  defined \n\u201cindigenous peoples.\u201d The project\u2019s inclusive approach will provide poor and vulnerable students \nfrom different parts of the country with access to skills development and training. No indigenous \npeoples, as per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, will be affected by the project. \n \n                                                \n25 Government of Bhutan, MOLHR. 2016.
