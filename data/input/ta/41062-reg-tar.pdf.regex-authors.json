The Poverty and Environment Fund (PEF) was established in July 2003 as a multi-donor \nfunding mechanism with initial contributions from the Governments of Norway and Sweden to \npromote  the  mainstreaming  of  environment  objectives  in  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \noperations and in the poverty-reduction strategies, plans, and projects of its developing member \ncountries (DMCs). The first regional technical assistance (TA) funded by PEF was the Poverty \nand  Environment  Program  (PEP).1   A  structured,  institutional  learning  program  aimed  at \nenhancing  the  effectiveness  of  poverty  reduction  efforts  through  sound  environmental \nmanagement, PEP is seeking to draw lessons from past projects, potentially replicable on-the-\nground pilot interventions, and targeted analytical studies.  PEP also is seeking to collect \nexperiences and best practices from a wide range of development projects and sources, and to \ndisseminate this knowledge to help better address the links between poverty and environment. \n \n2.  The Government of Norway has agreed to provide additional funding2 for PEF to expand \nactivities beyond PEP to further strengthen the mainstreaming of environment objectives. The \nproposed  TA  will  continue  to  finance  technical  assistance  grants  to  pilot-test  potentially \nreplicable approaches to solving environmental problems facing the poor. It will also provide \nupstream  support  for  environmental  analysis,  policy  advice,  sector  studies  and  project \npreparation, and provide support to environment mainstreaming at the country level. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  PEP has financed 16 subprojects, mostly pilot interventions plus a number of analytical \nstudies,  to  collect  and  disseminate  fresh  knowledge  on  poverty-environment  relationships.  \nHowever, there is still a substantive demand for these types of activities as indicated by the \nnumber of proposals received. PEP has provided ADB with a new mechanism for reaching out \nto community groups and nongovernment organizations, responding to their needs, and testing \nworkable arrangements with them\u2014all difficult to do under regular ADB investment modalities. \nInitial results have shown that such local arrangements to improve environmental management \nand the quality of life of communities can work well. PEP has also proven to be relevant in \nmeeting learning objectives and has demonstrated positive linkages to ADB operations.  \n \n4.  The  systems  established  under  PEP  support  continuous,  structured  learning              \nabout  poverty\u2013environment  relationships.  For  instance,  the  PEP  information-dissemination       \nfunction,  through  the  operation  of  the  Poverty  Environment  Net,  or  PE  Net, \n(www.povertyenvironment.net), a website-based information portal, has become a valuable core \nknowledge resource for poverty\u2013environment information and a vehicle for promoting improved \nunderstanding and action, not only in Asia but around the world. This website is actively used as \na  knowledge-sharing  mechanism  by  members  of  the  Poverty  Environment  Partnership,  an \ninformal  network  of  development  agencies  and  international  environmental  nongovernment \norganizations that aims to improve the coordination of work on poverty reduction and the \nenvironment. Through this partnership, ADB enhances its capacity and resources for capturing \nand disseminating knowledge about poverty and environment. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for the Poverty and Environment Program. Manila (TA 6150-REG, approved on \n16 December, for $3.92 million). \n2  ADB. 2006. Cooperation with Norway: Additional Contribution to the Poverty and Environment Fund. Manila. \n3  The concept paper of the TA was approved by ADB Management on 14 March 2007. The TA first appeared in ADB \nBusiness Opportunities on 20 October 2007. \n ", "2   \n5.  Given  that  PEP  was  implemented  to  pursue  only  a  limited  part  of  ADB\u2019s  overall \nenvironmental mainstreaming objectives, it is important to consider other ways that PEF can \ncatalyze and strengthen environmental mainstreaming and further contribute to ADB operations. \nExpanding the types of activities PEF supports could open new avenues for delivering effective \nenvironmental  management  approaches  in  poverty  reduction  interventions.  It  is  also  worth \nconsidering  how  PEF-financed  activities  can  contribute  to  enhancing  impact  on  ADB\u2019s \noperations in the context of country partnership strategy development and investment project \ndesign.    New  opportunities  exist  for  environment  mainstreaming  in  response  to  emerging \ndevelopment  challenges  in  the  region,  and  new  capacity  is  needed  to  respond  to  those \ndemands.  \n \n6.  To tackle the main economic, social, and environmental challenges facing DMCs, there \nis a need for intensified infrastructure investments, especially in the key sectors of energy, water, \ntransport, and urban development. Acknowledging the adverse environmental consequences of \ncurrent development patterns, this renewed infrastructure effort should be executed in a much \nmore environmentally conscious manner. This marks the beginning of a qualitative shift in the \nway ADB helps its DMCs meet their urban, energy, waste management and mobility needs. \nHowever, there are at least three important gaps in ADB\u2019s current capacities and approach. \nFirst, there is a need to move upstream of sector-by-sector efforts, both ADB-wide and at the \ncountry  level,  and  to  take  a  more  comprehensive,  integrative  perspective  on  promoting \nenvironmentally sustainable economic development in Asia and the Pacific. Second, in the \ncontext of greater inclusiveness, there is a need to sustain and restore the natural systems\u2014\nlands, forests, water bodies, coastal and marine ecosystems\u2014upon which most of the rural \npoor  rely  for  their  livelihoods,  and  which  underpin  the  region\u2019s  and  the  planet\u2019s  healthy \nenvironment.  Finally, there is a need to strengthen the capacity of both ADB and DMC staff to \npromote environmental sustainability, especially at the country level.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The intended overall impact of the proposed TA is increased implementation of sound \nenvironmental management practices by DMCs. The TA is expected to enhance mainstreaming \nof environment objectives in ADB operations and business processes.  The outputs of the TA \ncomprise  (i)  subproject  implementation,  (ii)  environment  mainstreaming  by  building  the \nenvironment  capacities  of  resident  missions  and  DMCs,  (iii)  knowledge  capture  and \ndissemination, and (iv) TA management and administration. These outputs will support the \nimpact and outcome of the proposed TA. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Subproject Implementation.  This will cover the financing of subprojects to \nimplement pilot interventions and analytical studies. \n  \n9.  Pilot  Interventions. This is in response to the high demand for these subprojects \nmanifested during PEP implementation, and to continue the structured learning exercise and the \nsynthesis of knowledge on poverty\u2013environment relationships and actions. As in the PEP, the \npilot  interventions  will  support  innovative  ideas  that  demonstrate  unique  institutional \narrangements, participatory approaches, or technical solutions to local environmental problems, \nwith clear potential for successful replication, mainstreaming, and/or upscaling in one or more \ncountries. \n ", "  3\n \n10.  Analytical Studies.  Support will be provided for three categories of analytical work to \nstrengthen  and  further  promote  environment  mainstreaming.  These  activities  are  aimed  at \nproviding useful insights and guidance for environmentally sustainable planning, programming, \nand project implementation by ADB and DMCs. The studies include the following.  \n \n(i)  Country or subregional studies for upstream consideration. These include \nenvironmental analysis, such as strategic environmental and poverty assessments, \npoverty-environment analysis, in-country or at the subregional level, and updating \nof country environment analysis. \n \n(ii)  Studies for project preparation and advisory activities. These link to lending \nand  non-lending  activities  to  enhance  environmental  aspects  or  prepare \nenvironment components of projects, but they should not be a substitute for project \npreparatory technical assistance or advisory technical assistance.  \n \n(iii)  Thematic policy advice and sector studies. These cover analytical studies for \nthematic areas of policies or sectors to provide policy advice, options, and basic \ninformation that are valuable for developing environment projects. \n \n11.  Participation in subproject implementation is open to all DMCs. The funding request for \neach proposed subproject should not exceed $250,0004 and should focus on environmental \ninterventions in the three focal areas5 identified in PEP. Proposed subprojects should be in \naddition to, and not substitutes for, ongoing or pipelined activities. Proposals will be reviewed \nand recommendations for funding will be made on the basis of the selection criteria (Appendix \n2).  Preparation  of  guidelines  on  subproject  preparation  and  implementation  will  take  into \naccount the lessons learned from PEP and facilitate approval and implementation.  \n \n12.  Output  2:  Environment  Mainstreaming  at  the  Country  Level.  Locally  recruited \nenvironment specialists will be assigned in at least five resident missions for a period of 3 years \nat most to help integrate environment into ADB and DMC activities. The Environment and Social \nSafeguard Division (RSES) of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD), \nin  close  consultation  with  regional  departments  and  resident  missions,  will  select  the \nenvironment specialists based on the criteria provided in Appendix 2.  \n \n13.  Output 3: Knowledge Capture and Dissemination.  The objective of this component is \nto continue PEP\u2019s initial efforts in collecting and spreading knowledge and understanding of \npoverty\u2013environment  relationships.  This  component  will  further  PEP\u2019s  achievements  in \nenhancing the ability of ADB and DMCs to respond effectively through development intervention \nwhen these links are identified. The operation of the PE Net and its further enhancement \nbeyond PEP will be supported. Other activities will include awareness raising and capacity \nbuilding, a conference and workshops, publications, and the production of other knowledge and \noutreach materials. \n \n14.  Output 4: TA Administration. This covers the overall management and administration \nof TA activities to ensure the desired outcome is attained.  ADB will administer the TA and is \n                                                 \n4  In special cases, when the steering committee determines it to be appropriate, proposals greater than $250,000 \nmay be considered. \n5   The focal areas are (i) natural resources management and sustainable livelihoods, (ii) pollution and health, and (iii) \nreduction of environmental vulnerability.   \n ", "4   \nexpected to coordinate this through RSES. A steering committee, comprising representatives of \nregional departments, RSDD, and other offices, will have overall oversight responsibilities for \nthe TA.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The financing for the TA will be administered by ADB. The total cost of the TA is \nestimated at $2.85 million and will be financed on a grant basis by PEF.  The cost estimates \ninclude consulting services, training and workshops, equipment, publications, and administrative \ncosts. The estimates are provided in Appendix 4. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 4 years, commencing in January 2008 and \nending in December 2011.  \n \n17.  Subprojects can be proposed by ADB staff through their respective departments and \nshould be recognized as activities of the department concerned. All levels of governments and \nnongovernment organizations, as well as other local organizations in the participating DMCs, \ncan also propose activities through ADB staff. Proposals will be solicited and reviewed at least \ntwice a year, or as required.   \n \n18.  The Steering Committee will provide strategic direction for TA implementation, review \nand  approve  subproject  proposals,  and  oversee  the  progress  in  implementing  approved \nsubprojects.    Subproject  proposals,  reviewed  and  prioritized  based  on  the  eligibility  and \nselection criteria (Appendix 2), will be selected for funding. To be eligible to participate in the TA \nactivities, DMCs will be requested to endorse the TA and appoint a focal point. No project funds \nwill be disbursed until an approval or \u201cno objection\u201d letter for the approved subproject is secured \nfrom the government concerned. Concerned departments are responsible for ensuring quality \nand consistency in the proposals, supervising the progress of implementation, and reporting the \nprogress to RSES on a periodic basis.  To ensure timely reporting of the status of subprojects, \nrelease of funds will be tied to the submission of progress reports.  \n \n19.  Administration of the TA is expected to be coordinated specifically through a small team \nin RSES. The team will be responsible for (i) preparing proposal guidelines and proposal \nformats; (ii) coordinating the proposal preparation, review, and selection process; (iii) screening \nproposals for eligibility; (iv) establishing and maintaining a system to monitor the implementation \nof  approved  TA  activities  and  disbursements;  (v)  implementing  knowledge  dissemination \nactivities; (vi) conducting annual review missions; and (vii) preparing TA progress reports and a \nfinal report on lessons learned.6 As part of the internal coordination, the team will collaborate \nperiodically with concerned departments to eliminate any duplication and/or conflict with other \nsimilar funds operations or research activities promoted by ADB.7  The team will work with \nRSDD\u2019s NGO and Civil Society Center and the Department of External Relations to implement \nknowledge dissemination activities and identify effective dissemination venues and methods, \n                                                 \n6  The TA will make use of systems and procedures established under PEP with some improvements to facilitate \nprocessing, implementation and monitoring of TA activities. \n7  Other funds managed by ADB include Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, \nGovernance Cooperation Fund, and Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector. \n ", "  5\nand collaborate with complementary initiatives8 to enhance synergy, cohost workshops, and \nexplore future cooperation for the TA implementation. \n \n20.  ADB will recruit the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).    The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsulting services are in Appendix 3. An international consultant will be recruited as a poverty\u2013\nenvironment specialist to provide technical support in the implementation of the TA and other \nrelated environment mainstreaming activities. A national consultant will be recruited as a TA \nadministration  specialist  to  assist  in  administering  the  TA  activities.  Two  other  national \nconsultants will be hired to maintain and operate the PE Net and PEP website.   \n \n21.  Preliminary selection of environment specialists will be undertaken jointly by RSES and \nthe  respective  regional  departments  and  resident  missions.  RSES  and  the  relevant \nrepresentative of each regional department and resident mission will be involved in interviewing \nand ranking the candidates for the environment specialist position. Each environment specialist \nwill be recruited for 1 year with the option for extension of up to 3 years, based on performance \nfor  the  first  year.  RSES  and  the  relevant  regional  departments  and  resident  missions  will \ncooperate closely in the development of the work program of the environment specialist. On \nproject specific work, the environment specialist will coordinate directly with team leaders in the \nregional department and the resident mission. On a day-to-day basis, the environment specialist \nreports  to,  and  works  under  the  direct  supervision  of,  the  Country  Director,  with  ongoing \ntechnical  support  from  RSES.  The  resident  missions  will  provide  logistical  support  to  the \nenvironment  specialist,  including  office  space,  furniture,  and  administrative  support.  The \nenvironment specialist will prepare quarterly progress reports for submission to RSES with a \ncopy to the respective regional department and resident mission.  \n \n22.  Other consultants will also be engaged to implement approved subproject activities. The \nrespective  regional  department  or  resident  mission  may  hire  consultants  or  allow  the \nimplementing  agency  to  hire  consultants  directly,  provided  that,  before  the  consultant  is \nengaged,  the  regional  department  or  resident  mission  reviews  and  approves  the  terms  of \nreference, draft contract, estimated cost, and resume. Their tasks will include assisting in the \nimplementation, evaluating and preparing the completion report for the individual approved \nsubproject activities. Small civil works, equipment, and materials to be financed by the TA will \nbe procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime)  or  other  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Equipment  purchased  for  subproject \nimplementation becomes the property of the beneficiary communities or implementing agency, \nas appropriate, after subproject completion \n \n23.  Progress reports on the TA and use of the PEF will be prepared by RSES on a 6-\nmonthly basis in collaboration with ADB\u2019s Office of Cofinancing Operations. TA activities will be \nmonitored and reports made available through the TA website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n24.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering the technical \nassistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $2,850,000  for  Mainstreaming  Environment  for \nPoverty Reduction to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty and Environment Fund.  \n                                                 \n8   Complementary  initiatives  include  the  Poverty  and  Environment  Initiative  of  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme and United Nations Environment Programme, and the Poverty Environment Partnership implemented \nby several funding agencies, including ADB. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact       Assumption \nIncreased implementation  Environment objectives   CPS reports/updates.
