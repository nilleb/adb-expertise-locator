THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  Macroeconomic context. Bangladesh has achieved more than 6.0% annual economic \ngrowth since 2011 and has recorded 7.9% in FY2018. The country\u2019s economy is expected to grow \nby  8%  in  2019  and  2020.1 Such  strong  growth  is  fueled  by  expansion  in  export-oriented \nmanufacturing including ready-made garments, light engineering, shipbuilding, agribusiness, \ninformation and communication technology (ICT) and pharmaceuticals.2 Expansion of these and \nother emerging sectors requires high skilled professionals who can effectively manage technical \nand organizational developments. Bangladesh workforce also needs diverse and adaptable skills \nto face the rapid changes in technologies.  \n \n2.  Education sector performance. The government has made continuous investments in \neducation, especially in promoting equitable access, enabling Bangladesh to achieve education-\nrelated Millennial Development Goals before 2015. Currently, almost all children go to primary \nschools, while two out of three children are enrolled in secondary education. Enrollment of girls \nexceeds that of boys in all levels of education, except for tertiary level. Tertiary education \nenrollment has grown from 13.9% in 2014 to is 20.6% in 2018 (17.0% females and 24.0% males). \nThese are still lower than the low middle income country average of 24.8% (25.4% female and \n24.3% male).3 With 1.3 million youth joining the labor market every year, turning the increasing \nworking population into skilled and productive human resources is a paramount agenda to the \ngovernment. \n \n3.  Role of tertiary education. Tertiary education is critical for a country\u2019s socioeconomic \ndevelopment in (i) producing high skilled workforce to drive innovation and to adapt to new \ntechnologies, (ii) providing up-skilling and re-skilling opportunities for existing workforce, and (iii) \nincreasing qualified professionals for teaching positions to improve overall education quality, etc.4 \n \n4.  Increasing demand for tertiary education. Increasing demand for tertiary education, \nespecially university level higher education, is evident, based on the demographic structure and \nstrong economic growth forecast. The gross enrollment rate was 17.6% in 2017, and the total \nhigher education enrollment was estimated at 3.3 million in 2016, which is expected to rise to \n4.6 million in 2026 as the population grows. Access to higher education has been improved by \nthe increase in private universities operating under the Private University Act, 1992 (amended in \n2010). Education quality and accountability vary widely in private universities, however, which \nneeds to be addressed through close supervision while respecting the autonomy of the private \nuniversities.  \n \n5.  Issues in quality and relevance. Teaching and learning and assessments in tertiary \neducation are focused on absorption of knowledge and information and do not encourage critical \n \n1  ADB. 2019.

Washington D.C.  \n3  UNESCO Institute for Statistics. http://data.uis.unesco.org/ (accessed on 7 October 2019).  \n4  A systematic review of the impact of tertiary education on development concluded that tertiary education seems to \nhave stronger impact on economic growth than was previously assumed through stronger earnings of graduates, \npositive impact of workplace productivity, higher likelihood of technological adaptation, strengthening of institutions, \nand formation of professionals in key areas such as education and healthcare. Department for International \nDevelopment, Government of United Kingdom. 2014. The Impact of Tertiary Education on Development. London. \nAccessible from https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-impact-of-tertiary-education-on-development.    \n \n ", "2   \nthinking or creativity. Outdated or knowledge-overloaded curricular, lecture-based pedagogy, high \nstudent-faculty ratios, and obelete and inadequate facilities constrain tertiary education quality. \nThe relevance of higher education to the job market needs strengthening. Employers emphasize \nsoft skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, communication, and collaboration in addition \nto academic knowledge, but these qualities are lacking among university graduates. Only one-\nthird of employers maintain sustained partnerships with universities, mainly for recruitment.5 \nResearch and development activities are limited due to lack of funding and research personnel, \nand mostly driven by academic interests, with little relevance to industry needs.  \n \n6.  Asian Development Bank\u2019s Assistance. Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been a \nlong-term partner in education sector development in Bangladesh, especially in school education \nand skills development. ADB currently supports primary and secondary education sector-wide \napproaches with emphasis on Science, Mathematics, English, and use of ICT. ADB is assisting \nthe government in expanding job-relevant training opportunities focusing on basic to mid-level \nskills linked with job placements through industry partnerships. Since 2018, the government has \nrequested several interventions in tertiary education development.6  \n \n7.  Building upon the achievements of past and ongoing education sector projects as well as \nlessons from recent engagement in tertiary education, ADB will help the government make \nstrategic investments for the subsector catering to specific industries\u2019 demand for improved \nhuman capital and contribute to socioeconomic transformation. Lessons from the preparatory \nwork for the Improving Computer and Software Engineering Tertiary Education Project are (i) that \nwider stakeholder consultants (especially with industry and students) are crucial to inform the \nproject design and convince universities and the government to adopt innovative approaches, \nand (ii) that quality and relevance improvement measures require several rounds of discussion to \ngather momentum for institution-wide buy-in. A technical assistance providing strategic technical \ninputs through resource persons and expert consultants has been highly appreciated by the \ngovernment and stakeholders as the technical areas require understanding of latest industry \nrequirements, international good practices, and innovative approaches proven successful in other \ncountries. ADB will focus its efforts in specific disciplines or universities to provide integrated \nsupports in developing new and upgraded higher education programs, addressing the gaps in \nquality and relevance of those programs. This approach complements the World Bank\u2019s higher \neducation  interventions  aiming  at  improving  university  governance,  quality  assurance,  and \nresearch capacity across the whole sub-sector.  \n \n8.  Rationale for a transaction technical assistance facility. The transaction TA facility will \nprovide  project  preparation  support  and  capacity  building  to  a  series  of  ensuing  projects, \ncomprising (i) Improving Computer and Software Engineering Tertiary Education Project (for \ncommitment in 2020), (ii) Digital University Development Project (2020), (iii) Innovations in \nTertiary  Education  for  Competitiveness  (Advanced  Agriculture)  Project  (2021),  and  (iv) \nInnovations in Tertiary Education for Competitiveness (Garments and Textiles) Project (2022).7 \nAll ensuing projects are in the tertiary education subsector, where the Ministry of Education, the \nUniversity  Grants  Commissions,  relevant  universities,  and  industry  partners  will  be  key \nstakeholders in project design and implementation. The project preparation will require similar set \nof due diligence in technical, safeguard, poverty, social, gender, fiduciary management and \neconomic assessment. Using a TA facility is suitable as it will enhance project preparation \n \n5  Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies. 2018.

The transaction TA facility will provide implementation support to the ensuing projects as \nwell as policy advice based on studies and consultations where ADB can add value addition, \nbased on the implementation of ensuing projects. This transaction TA facility is included in the \ncountry operations and business plan 2020\u20132022 for Bangladesh, as a transaction TA with the \ntitle \u201cSupport to Innovations in Tertiary Education for Competitiveness\u201d (footnote 7).  \n \nB.

THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  Bangladesh achieved more than 6% annual economic growth since 2011 and recorded \n7.9% economic growth in FY2018. The stable economic growth has been driven by ready-made \ngarment sector export, strong consumption, and public investment. Sustaining economic growth \nrequires diversifying the economic base and creating new sources of growth. Digital Bangladesh \nis an integral part of national development strategy since 2010 and the government expects \ninformation technology (IT) industry to make significant contribution to the economy.1 IT sector \ndevelopment will generate new growth opportunities, creating large number of jobs, increase \neconomy-wide productivity, and improve service delivery through e-government initiatives.  \n \n2.  Bangladesh IT industry and human resource constraints. Bangladesh\u2019s IT industry is \nin nascent stage of development, with two thirds of firms established after 2000. Most of the firms \nare small, with around 95% having less than 100 personnel. They are mostly engaged in the lower \nend of the value chain. The industry faces several challenges among which lack of skilled human \nresource is the most critical constraint. With increasing push for cost competitiveness and advent \nof Industrial Revolution 4.0, IT industry is facing enormous opportunities and challenges globally. \nCompanies across world are increasing focus on research and development (R&D), speed of \nexecution, product quality and services. Search for new-age skills such as machine learning \nengineers, application development analysts, back-end developers, data scientists, as well as \nupskilling and reskilling existing personnel are the top priorities for the industry. Annually, the \nindustry hires around 15,000 people where one third are computer science and engineering and \nIT (CSE/IT) degree holders.2 Many universities offer CSE/IT degree programs producing around \n12,000 graduates every year, but with large variance in competencies and readiness for job. \nOverall, quality of new entrants is inadequate. Over 80% of job seekers fail in written test on basic \ncoding skills, mathematics, and English. For mid-level skills such as testing, business analysis, \nand project management, the industry cannot find domestic talent and hires from neighboring \ncountries at higher wages. This undermines business profitability and limits domestic talent pool. \n \n3.  Limited access to quality CSE/IT programs. Absolute number of CSE/IT program seats \nmay seem enough, but access to quality programs is limited as evidenced by inadequate talent \npool for the industry.3 Currently, technological changes outpace existing CSE/IT programs. \nIntroducing new curricula is also constrained by lack of physical facilities, especially purpose-fit \nlaboratories. Hands-on practical sessions are critical for core technical competencies such as \nproblem-solving skills and use of IT equipment and applications, but practical sessions constitute \nless than 30% in public universities. This is even less in private universities (footnote 2). Even the \nlimited laboratory time is not effective as laboratories are often in poorly equipped or maintained.4 \n \n1  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission, Ministry of Planning. 2012.

This figure is only for jobs \nrequiring CSE/IT degree and diploma level qualifications.  \n3  CSE/IT program enrollment is estimated at 13 to 16% of overall university enrollment. In public universities, CSE/IT \nenrollment is 9,488 or less than 4% of overall public university enrollment in 2015. Enrollment in engineering and \ntechnology programs (including CSE/IT) is around 104,274 or 30% in private universities.  \n4  ADB. 2018. Tracer Study of CSE/IT Graduates from 9 Universities. Unpublished. The study covers Bangladesh \nUniversity of Engineering and Technology, University of Dhaka, Jahangirnagar University, Jashore University of \nScience and Technology (4 public universities), Islamic University of Technology (1 international university), \nAhsanullah University of Science and Technology, BRAC University, Daffodil International University and East West \n \n ", "2 \nWhile  many  universities  and  training  providers  offer  short  term  courses  for  immediate  job \nopportunities such as programming languages, IT professionals have limited opportunities for \nupskilling to keep the pace with the technological advances and global business practices. There \nshould be better access to modern, quality educational facilities and short-term and long-term \nprofessional training programs for higher skills. Currently, only a few universities have adopted \ninternational  quality  assurance  system.  International  accreditation  will  help  universities \ncontinuously  align  their  academic  programs  with  international quality  standards  that reflect \nindustry requirements and technological changes.   \n \n4.  Outdated teaching and learning practices and limited research capacity. A strong \nfaculty is the backbone of academic and research work in universities. Current teaching practices \nare teacher-centric and theory-focused, and assessment is largely examination-based. Changing \nthe curriculum is largely constrained by rigid academic governance practices. Increasing number \nof faculty members have higher qualification such as Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), but faculty \nmembers lack exposure to industry practices and technology trend. Faculty members have few \nopportunities in improving pedagogic skills and adopting modern approaches in technology \neducation. R&D activities in university are limited due to lack of funding, little incentives for faculty \nand students, inadequate number of post-graduate students. Together with faculty capacity, post-\ngraduate programs are important to supply technology leaderships, carry out R&D for innovative \ntechnology solutions, and nurture future faculty. However, a high proportion of post graduate \nstudents drop out to take immediate jobs forgoing higher wage in the future when they obtain \npostgraduate degree.  \n \n5.  Low relevance of CSE/IT education to industry demand. While some industry partners \nare involved in curriculum design and course delivery, overall, industry relevance of CSE/IT \neducation needs urgent improvement. Students are poorly informed on industry requirements. \nFew universities have internship programs. Assessments are mostly about knowledge. Soft skills \nsuch as collaboration, communications, analytical thinking, and creativity are not given priority \nthough  employers  cite  them  as  important.5 University  R&D  activities  are  driven  by  faculty \nmembers\u2019 academic interest and do not reflect industry interest or provide solution to industry \nproblems. Interdisciplinary R&D should be emphasized to encourage innovative IT solutions for \nmanagement, medicine, manufacturing, infrastructure development, environment, and various \nservices. Globally, universities became hub for technology startups leveraging knowledge and \ntalents of university personnel with strong industry linkages. However, Bangladesh universities \nlack resources, knowhow and industry linkages to support startups.  \n \n6.  Women in CSE/IT education and IT industry. While gender parity has been met in \nprimary and secondary education, only 31% of university enrollment is women. As in other \ncountries, fewer female students are enrolled in technology areas in Bangladesh due to gender \nstereotyping. In addition, the industry jobs requiring odd working hours and late stays discourage \nfemale students and workers from pursuing CSE/IT programs or industry careers. In public \nuniversity CSE/IT programs, female students are 22%, but in IT industry, 19% of entry level \nworkers are women. This ratio drops to 16% of overall human resource indicating low retention \nrate and career progression among female workers (footnote 2).  \n \n7.  Government plans. The government\u2019s Vision 2021 has strong emphasis on ICT-driven \nknowledge-based society under the Digital Bangladesh. Education is the most important pillar to \n \nUniversity (4 private universities). Employers surveyed think universities should focus on use of ICT, problem solving \nskills and communication skills. \n5  ADB. IT/ITES Employer Survey in Bangladesh.

The government prioritizes tertiary education to lead the economy to a new growth \ntrajectory, especially in IT industry.  \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition.  ADB  has  been  a  long-term  partner  in  education  sector \ndevelopment in Bangladesh, especially in basic education and skills development. ADB currently \nsupports primary and secondary education sector-wide approaches with emphasis on science, \nmathematics, English, and use of information and communication technology.6 ADB is assisting \nthe government in expanding job-relevant training opportunities focusing on basic to mid-level \nskills  linked  with  job  placements  through  industry  partnership.7 The  proposed  project  will \ncomplement with ongoing education sector interventions by expanding quality tertiary education \nopportunities. It will complement the skills development initiative by filling the gap in higher skills \nand expand opportunities for more high-end upskilling and reskilling for IT industry professionals.  \n \nB.  Proposed Solutions \n \n9.  The proposed project will help increase enrollment and improve relevance and quality of \nCSE/IT programs in four selected universities.8 It aims to increase job-ready graduates, enhance \nR&D capacity through industry collaboration and interdisciplinary research projects, and develop \ntechnology  entrepreneurship  to  respond  to  increasing  demand  and  changing  priorities  of \nindustries. These objectives will be delivered by four outputs:  \n \n10.  Output 1: Modern learning, research, and startup facilities established. This output \nwill support the four universities to develop classrooms, laboratories, industry collaboration and \nstartup space,9 and auxiliary facilities. ADB will help the universities to adopt green building \nfeatures for energy and water saving and climate and disaster resilient design. The buildings will \nalso include women friendly facilities such as sanitation facilities with adequate number and \nquality, female students\u2019 study areas, female staff lounges as well as security and safety features \nsuch as access control system, increase lighting at night, and video surveillance system.    \n \n11.  Output 2: Quality and industry-relevance of CSE/IT programs enhanced. This output \nwill help the universities to update and improve the CSE/IT degree programs by incorporating the \nlatest technologies, blended learning, and industry-demanded soft-skills. These new and updated \nprograms will pursue internationally recognized accreditation to ensure continuous improvement \nin quality, aligned with international standards for practicing engineers, even after the project is \nended. The project will ensure adequate number of qualified faculty members to deliver quality \neducation programs and carry out and guide research projects. The universities will expand \nreskilling and upskilling programs for IT professionals developed in collaboration with industry \npartners, aiming at continuous professional development at par with fast changing technologies. \n \n6  ADB. 2018.

The universities will introduce mandatory internship or capstone projects for \nundergraduate  students.  The  universities  will  also  strengthen  student  services  for  career \ncounseling, industry placement, alumni networks, etc., especially for female students. The project \nwill facilitate IT industry to introduce and test flexible work hours and working from home \narrangements to encourage more women\u2019s employment in IT industry.  \n \n12.  Output  3:  R&D  and technology  entrepreneurship  strengthened. This  output  will \nstrengthen R&D capacity and technology entrepreneurships through (i) competitive R&D grant \nscheme and (ii) startup or incubation support services at the four universities. The University \nGrants Commission (UGC) will provide R&D grants to competitively selected proposals focusing \non (i) industry collaboration to address industry problems or develop new products or services; \n(ii) interdisciplinary work where IT solutions combined with other areas to develop new products \nor services; (iii) cutting edge CSE/IT research; and (iv) IT solutions for addressing disability issues. \nMore  emphasis  will  be  given  to  industry  collaboration  (50%  of  total  grant  funding)  and \ninterdisciplinary research (25%). This output will also introduce (i) technology entrepreneurships \ntraining program for students, faculty members as well as IT professionals, and (ii) conducive \nrules and incentives to encourage more university-based startups and spinoff firms, utilizing the \nphysical space and supporting services provided through the startup/incubation facilities under \nOutput 1. The output will also provide postgraduate stipend to increase number and retention of \nmaster and Ph.D. students to provide IT industry with higher skilled IT professionals, strengthen \nR&D capacity, and increase the pool for future faculty members for other universities.    \n \n13.  Output 4: Project management and new tertiary education project preparation \nsupported. The project will support the government to carry out project management activities, \nbackground studies, feasibility studies, and project preparatory activities for new tertiary education \ninitiatives in priority economic sectors.    \n \n14.  These outputs will result in the following outcome: Industry responsiveness of tertiary level \nCSE/IT education improved.10 The project will be aligned with the following impact: A highly skilled \nlabor force equipped with the necessary technical and professional expertise developed. These \nare fully aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for Bangladesh where ADB \ninterventions aim at enhancing the quality of the workforce through better education and skills \ndevelopment.11 It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, addressing the remining poverty and \nreducing inequalities through improving education and training.12 The proposed project is included \nin the country operations business plan 2019\u20132021.13  \n \nC.  Proposed Financing Plans and Modality  \n \n15.  The project is estimated to cost $130 million. ADB will finance $100 million from its ordinary \ncapital resources (concessional loan). The government will provide $30 million as counterpart \nfunding to cover salary for project management staff and faculty, operational costs, a part of civil \nworks and equipment, and taxes and duties.

Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe National Education Policy 2010 sets out purpose of higher education to generate and make innovations in \nknowledge, and at the same time build up a skilled workforce. The proposed project closely aligns with this objective, \nand aim to increase access, quality and relevance of higher education as highlighted in Bangladesh\u2019s Seventh Five-\nYear Plan. The proposed project is particularly relevant for Digital Bangladesh which is an integral part of Vision \n2021. The government aims to diversify main contributor to economic growth other than garment sector, and \ninformation technology (IT) and IT-enabled services (ITES) industry are expected to become a driving force for \ninclusive growth by nurturing highly skilled workforces. The proposed project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Country \nPartnership Strategy for Bangladesh (2016\u20132020) that prioritizes enhancing the quality of workforce through better \neducation and skills development. It will also contribute to CPS\u2019s strategic objective of promoting economic \ndiversification to enhance the economy\u2019s long-term growth potential. \nB.

Key issues and potential beneficiaries.  \nBangladesh\u2019s aspiration to realize Digital Bangladesh needs to be bolstered by innovations through quality and \nrelevant higher education participation. The Seventh Five-year plan (2016\u20132020) aims to increase higher education \nenrollment from 12% to 20%, but the current higher education enrolment rate of 17.6% in 2017, below the average \nrate of 23% of lower middle-income countries. The strategic plan for higher education for 2018\u20132030 aims to increase \nthe university admission from 350,130 in 2015 to 369,095 in 2026, and the proposed project will contribute to achieve \nthis goal. Bangladesh IT/ITES industry is constrained by lack of qualified human resources. Companies and more \nthan 500,000 freelancers are engaged in low-end services. The job opportunities are concentrated in urban areas, \nand people from rural areas have very limited access to CSE/IT education and IT sector job opportunities.  \n \nThe proposed project will address (i) access, (ii) quality, (iii) relevance of CSE and IT education as well as lack of \nresearch and development activities to support IT/ITES industry growth. The students from four universities \n(Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, University of Dhaka, Jashore University of Science and \nTechnology, East West University) will be the main beneficiaries. Across four universities, the current annual intake \nwill be increased from 675 (29.9% women) to 1,835 students at undergraduate level and from 307 (25.7% women) \nto 765 at postgraduate level (Master and PhD) by 2025, and they are selected based on academic merit. Diploma \nand professional certificate courses will also cater a larger number of IT professionals for upgrading skills. An \nunaccounted number of future generations of university students and staffs will continue to benefit beyond project \nimplementation period. Private and public employers, more specifically the IT/ITES companies, will benefit from \nrecruitments of more qualified graduates. Research and innovation activities in CSE/IT departments will also \ncontribute to improve IT/ITES industry competitiveness. The proposed project will expand the foundation of skilled \nworkers in formal sector through tertiary education, professional certificate courses as well as start-up support in \nurban area as well as rural area in Jessore where Sheikh Hasina Software Park is established by the government \nfunding. \n \n2.  Impact channels and expected systemic changes.  \nThe proposed project aims at improving tertiary CSE/IT education to meet industry demand through (i) increasing \nenrolment in public and private universities; (ii) improving the quality and relevance of education through international \naccreditation, (iii) promoting innovation through competitive grant funding mechanism partly targeting industry \nrelevant research; and (iv) improving student career guidance and industry attachment, Three public universities \nenroll students by merit, and tuition is negligible. East-West University is a private university. The project will provide \nstipends for rural and female students to help with their living expenses and make university education more \naffordable. Successfully completing CSE/IT education will help poor and disadvantaged students to get skilled jobs \nwith higher salary. One of the proposed four universities is outside of Dhaka (Jessore) and it will offer quality \neducation and professional training opportunities to the rural population. The competitive research grants and startup \nsupports will leverage highly skilled human resource in universities to collaborate with IT/ITES industry and other \nacademic disciplines to develop new products and services using IT solutions, thus contributing to IT/ITES industry \ndevelopment and utilization of IT services for socio-economic development. The project will contribute to the \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \nrealization of the Sustainable Development Goal 4: Quality Education, Goal 5: Gender Equality, and Goal 8: Decent \nWork and Economic Growth.  \n3.  Focus of (and resources allocated in) the transaction TA or due diligence.  \nConsultants to conduct due diligence have already been fielded to carry out (i) environment impact assessment \nand (ii) social safeguard assessment on proposed infrastructure development. Other reviews including economic \nand financial analysis as well as gender analysis will be conducted by ADB staff during project preparatory period.  \nII.  GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT \n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project or program?  \nWhile enrollment figures are higher for girls than boys in primary and secondary education, female enrollment for \nthe higher education is considerably lower than males in 2017 (14.5% for female and 20.6% for male) and only 31% \nof university enrollment is women. Despite improvement in female enrollment in recent years, the gap of women\u2019s \nparticipation in higher education, particularly related to advanced science and technology fields, needs to be \nreduced. In CSE/IIT related faculties, female students only account for around 22%, and addressing gender \nstereotyping remains a significant challenge. From employment perspectives, although the country\u2019s unemployment \nrate has been stable around 4.2% in the last few years, youth unemployment rate (age 15\u201324) has continuously \nincreased since 2010, reaching 12.3% in 2016. The unemployment rate with tertiary education background (overall: \n11.2%, male: 8.3%, female: 21.4%) is more than twice than overall unemployment rate, and transition from higher \neducation to labor market needs further improvement, particularly for females. The female unemployment rate is \naround 6.7% in 2016, which is consistently higher than that of males (3.1%). Lower female labor force participation \n(36.3% for female as opposed to 80.5% for male) has been a key policy challenge, which remains quite low \ncompared with other lower middle-income countries. Informal economy, female child marriage, skills mismatch, \naccess to finance and disparities in wages, among others, are hindrance to increase female labor force participation. \nIn addition, in public university CSE/IT programs, female students are 25%, but in IT/ITES industry, 19% of entry \nlevel workers are women. This ratio drops to 16% of overall human resource indicating low retention rate and career \nprogression among female workers. In the Bangladesh IT sector, recruitment of female university graduates is less \nthan half of male university graduates in 2017/18. The female employees have less turnover, good dedication to \nwork, and ability to take challenges, but employers consider security, working location and family commitments when \nthey  recruit  female  employees.  The  focus  group  discussions  with  female  graduates  suggest  the  areas  of \nimprovement  in  career  guidance,  on-the-job-training,  computer  equipment  infrastructure  development,  more \npractical sessions, and specialization in certain field. The ability to work in a team with problem solving skills and \ncommunication skills in English are other areas which make differences during the job interviews. \n2. Does the proposed project or program have the potential to make a contribution to the promotion of gender \nequity and/or empowerment of women by providing women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, \nresources, assets, and participation in decision making?    Yes         No     \nKey areas the proposed project should address for mainstreaming gender include: increasing female students\u2019 \nretention in CSE/IT programs, especially in private university; improving female graduates\u2019 employability; and \ntransforming social norms and attitudes that restrict women\u2019s enrolment in CSE/IT education and relevant jobs.  \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality? \n  Yes          No     \n4. Indicate the intended gender mainstreaming category:      GEN (gender equity)    EGM (effective gender \nmainstreaming)     SGE (some gender elements)    NGE (no gender elements)\n \nIII.  PARTICIPATION AND EMPOWERMENT \n1. Who are the main stakeholders of the project, including beneficiaries and negatively affected people? Identify \nhow they will participate in the project design. \nThe main stakeholders of the project are the Ministry of Education, University Grants Commission, universities, \nprivate education providers, private and public sector employers, university students and their parents. Communities \nadjacent to the proposed universities will also benefit from the new business that will be generated from the increased \nstudent influx. Key stakeholders were consulted to identify the nature of the development need, the availability of \nresources (such as land for infrastructure construction), and partner capacity. The consultations have also been held \nduring project design stage, especially with female and male students, lecturers and education providers, employers, \nand civil society organizations to incorporate their views and recommendations. For instance, tracer study of CSE/IT \ngraduates and employer survey of the Bangladesh IT sector, including key informant interview and gender \ndisaggregated focus group discussions have been conducted and informed the proposed project design. \n2. How can the project contribute (in a systemic way) to engaging and empowering stakeholders and beneficiaries, \nparticularly, the poor, vulnerable and excluded groups? What issues in the project design require participation of \nthe poor and excluded? \nThe four selected universities under the proposed project use merit-based university admission system, but poor \nstudents have hard time to earn living expenses for continuing education. Dropout is high in private university as \nwell as post-graduate courses in public universities, mainly due to financial issues. The proposed project will provide \nstipend for these students, particularly for females, and aim to improve completion rate. The project will also conduct \n ", "Appendix 3  13 \n \nconsultations among underprivileged students regarding other forms of support they need and which can be covered \nby the project (e.g. securing scholarships from companies for underprivileged but deserving students) to help them \npursue and complete the undergraduate degree programs. \n3. What are the key, active, and relevant civil society organizations in the project area? What is the level of civil \nsociety organization participation in the project design?  \n  Information generation and sharing    Consultation    M     Collaboration      M   Partnership  \nCivil society organizations working on gender equality, social inclusion, and private sector engagement would include \nchambers of commerce, women\u2019s organizations and International Labor Organization. Effective collaborations and \npartnerships with such organizations already working in the area of female labor force participation, technical \neducation and employability can underpin better impacts.  \n4. Are there issues during project design for which participation of the poor and excluded is important? What are \nthey and how shall they be addressed?    Yes          No    Participation of the poor and excluded during the \nproject design is important to identify strategies and approaches in addressing constraints related to expanding IT \nrelated tertiary education opportunities and employment constraints to students from rural and vulnerable groups. \nIV.  SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS \nA. Involuntary Resettlement Category   A     B     C     FI \n1. Does the project have the potential to involve involuntary land acquisition resulting in physical and economic \ndisplacement?    Yes          No     \nThe environment and social safeguards due diligence confirms no involuntary resettlement impact. In University of \nDhaka, the building site is currently used for bachelor staff quarter for 25 persons, but they will be given new flats \nat a new university residential building, which will be completed by June 2019. They will move to the new premise \nwell before the civil work commences. All proposed constructions will be on already available lands belonging to \nuniversities, within the existing campus.  \n2. What action plan is required to address involuntary resettlement as part of the transaction TA or due diligence \nprocess?   Resettlement plan                     Resettlement framework                      Social impact matrix \n Environmental and social management system arrangement                     None \nB.  Indigenous Peoples Category   A     B     C     FI \n1. Does the proposed project have the potential to directly or indirectly affect the dignity, human rights, livelihood \nsystems, or culture of indigenous peoples?          Yes          No  There are no indigenous people within the \nproject area who fall within the purview of ADB Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n2. Does it affect the territories or natural and cultural resources indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or claim, as \ntheir ancestral domain?     Yes          No     \n3. Will the project require broad community support of affected indigenous communities?    Yes      No    \n4. What action plan is required to address risks to indigenous peoples as part of the transaction TA or due \ndiligence process? \n Indigenous peoples plan       Indigenous peoples planning framework      Social Impact matrix   \n Environmental and social management system arrangement                       None \nV.  OTHER SOCIAL ISSUES AND RISKS \n1. What other social issues and risks should be considered in the project design? \n Creating decent jobs and employment (L)    Adhering to core labor standards (L)   Labor retrenchment \n Spread of communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS      Increase in human trafficking (L)  \n Affordability (L)   Increase in unplanned migration (L)      Increase in vulnerability to natural disasters  \n Creating political instability   Creating internal social conflicts     \n2.  How are these additional social issues and risks going to be addressed in the project design? \nHIV/AIDS awareness program will be provided to laborers and adjacent communities, including use of awareness \nmaterials displayed and distributed to workers and dwellers in the project area. \nVI.  TRANSACTION TA OR DUE DILIGENCE RESOURCE REQUIREMENT \n1. Do the terms of reference for the transaction TA (or other due diligence) contain key information needed to be \ngathered during transaction TA or due diligence process to better analyze (i) poverty and social impact; (ii) gender \nimpact, (iii) participation dimensions; (iv) social safeguards; and (v) other social risks. Are the relevant specialists \nidentified?        Yes                    No       \n2. What resources (e.g., consultants, survey budget, and workshop) are allocated for conducting poverty, social \nand/or gender analysis, and participation plan during the transaction TA or due diligence?  \nConsultants are mobilized to conduct due diligence on environment and social safeguards. A tracer study and an \nemployers survey as well as focus group discussions were carried out by the TA for gender and social analysis.  \n \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "G92", "CreationDate": "D:20200217171151+08'00'", "Creator": "PDF24 Creator", "Keywords": "adb project concept paper", "ModDate": "D:20200218074910+08'00'", "Producer": "GPL Ghostscript 9.14", "Title": "Concept paper"}}
