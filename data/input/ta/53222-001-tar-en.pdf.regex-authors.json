THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The regional transaction TA facility will provide project preparation support to a series of \nensuing projects in Central Asia, comprising: (i) Power Distribution Enhancement, Renewable \nEnergy and Energy Efficiency Projects in the Kyrgyz Republic; and (ii) Power Sector Development \nProgram in the Republic of Tajikistan. In addition, the TA Facility will provide high-level screening, \ndue  diligence  and  formulation  of  the  components  for  the  Sector  Development  Project  in \nKazakhstan. All ensuing projects are in the energy sector and require a similar set of safeguard, \nfinancial management, or economic assessments. This TA facility is not included in the current \nCountry Operations Business Plans of these 3 countries. Nevertheless, all ensuing projects under \nthis transaction TA facility are listed in their current Country Operations Business Plans. \n \n2.  The electricity sector of Central Asia, developed during the former Soviet Union time, was \nprimarily designed to optimize the use of water resources with electricity being a secondary \nproduct.  Power  plants  and  transmission  lines  were  built  without  the  consideration  of  the \nadministrative boundaries, which later became national borders. After the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion in 1991, the energy ministers of the Central Asian states faced a new challenge of \nautonomously operating national power grids that were not designed to do so. In addition to \ntechnical complexities, the energy sector in these countries followed different development paths.  \n \n3.  In the Kyrgyz Republic, the electricity sector experienced major transformations. The first \nsector reform to unbundle the vertically integrated power utility into 6 companies took place in \n2000. Since then, a number of developments took place including the transfer of all state shares \nin energy companies to the newly created National Energy Holding Company (NEHC) in 2016. \nNevertheless, aging assets, tariffs below cost recovery levels and the lack of investments for \nrefurbishment and maintenance of energy assets has resulted in poor power supply reliability and \nquality with frequent outages and regular voltage and frequency fluctuations. \n \n4.  ADB has been supporting the rehabilitation of aging large hydro powerplants, including \nToktogul hydropower plant (HPP) and Uch-Kurgan HPP, but rehabilitation is also needed for \nsmaller power plants. Small HPPs of the Joint Stock Company (JSC) Chakan HPP have been in \nservice for 60-89 years without major rehabilitation. They experience frequent equipment failure \nand considerable expenditures on maintenance and repair. Rehabilitation of turbine-generators \nand balance of the plant will improve generation reliability and increase the installed capacity.   \n \n5.  Power distribution grid of the Kyrgyz Republic is in a similar condition. Most of the \ndistribution network in Bishkek, including substations, were constructed in the 1960s and 1970s. \nAged assets and the absence of modern supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) \nsystem result in poor reliability and service quality and leads to higher distribution losses. No \ndemand-side energy efficiency programs have been implemented on a large scale even for simple \nactivities such as energy efficient lighting for public and residential sectors. In addition, penetration \nof modern technologies in the electricity sector remains low.  \n \n6.  In view of the challenges faced by the energy sector, the proposed intervention of ADB \nintends to address these issues in a combined manner through one multidirectional project, which \nwill  focus  on  refurbishment  of  small  hydro  power  plants,  construction  of  new \ntransmission/distribution assets, implementation of demand-side energy efficiency measures, \nintroduction of modern technologies, and renewable energy in district heating. \n \n ", "2 \n7.  The Tajik electricity sector faced problems similar to those in the Kyrgyz Republic.  \nGeneration and transmission assets were used beyond their technical and economic life, tariffs \nremained extremely low, and financing was insufficient for the sector needs. These conditions \nwere exacerbated by 8 years of civil unrest in the 1990s and the disconnection of the Tajik grid \nfrom the Central Asian Power System (CAPS) in 2009, which severely limited the country\u2019s trade \nopportunities and ability to supply indigenous electricity within the national grid. \n  \n8.  The government responded to these issues through rehabilitation and construction of \ntransmission and generation assets with financing from multilateral and bilateral development \npartners. These efforts substantially improved the electricity supply, reduced winter power deficit \nand opened new export opportunities. However, such extensive investments in combination with \nlow tariffs, inadequate metering and billing system, weak governance, and lagging sector reforms \nresulted in financial insolvency of the vertically integrated state power utility, JSC Barqi Tojik. \n \n9.  ADB is the largest financier in the Tajikistan energy sector among development partners. \nIn 2016, ADB provided support to develop the Electricity Market Development Strategy to address \nthe sector\u2019s financial sustainability. Reforms in this strategy were developed in close cooperation \nwith the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and \nincludes:  (i)  unbundling  of  JSC  Barqi  Tojik  into  generation,  transmission  and  distribution \ncompanies; (ii) establishment of a market operator; (iii) centralized cash management by creating \na sector-wide escrow account; (iv) adoption of a new tariff methodology and establishment of the \nsector regulator; (v) restructuring of financial liabilities of JSC Barqi Tojik; (vi) installation of a new \nretail metering and billing system; and (vii) introduction of a 5-year management contract for the \nnew distribution company. These reforms are supported by ADB through the proposed Power \nSector Development Program with possible cofinancing from EBRD and the Islamic Development \nBank.1  \n \n10.  Developments in the electricity sector of neighboring Kazakhstan were substantially \ndifferent from those in Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic. After the independence in 1991, \nKazakhstan\u2019s power sector was at the forefront of introducing a liberalized multimarket model\u2014\nconsisting of bilateral, spot, balancing, ancillary, and capacity submarkets. The sector was \nregarded as a market reform leader among countries of the former Soviet Union, having achieved \nmuch improved supply and demand balance and service quality compared to its peers.  \n \n11.  However, despite the noteworthy headway, the sector reforms remain predominantly \nunfinished and in recent years, were rstateolled back in liberalizing the wholesale market. The \nhalting of the country\u2019s power generation privatization program has resulted in: (i) the decrease \nin strategic foreign investment; (ii) the reduction of liquidity of the earlier thriving spot market; and \n(iii) the re-emergence of excessive government control over the market. The government owns \nand controls the JSC Samruk-Energy, the largest electricity generator, and the Kazakhstan \nElectricity  Grid  Operating  Company  (KEGOC).  As  a  result,  the  sector  faces  the  following \nchallenges: (i) high energy intensity; (ii) formidable investment requirements; and (iii) ineffective \nregulation and sector reform reversal. According to the World Bank, $42 billion in investments are \nrequired by 2030 only in generation to meet the targets set by the government.2 To achieve this, \nthere is an urgent need for high-level screening and preliminary assessments of potential project \nopportunities  for  the  planned  Energy  Sector  Development  Program  or  a  new  project  and \nidentification of financing structures.  \n \n1 Most of the preparatory work for Sector Development Program was done under G0213-TAJ: Regional Power \nTransmission Project. However, complexity of reforms envisaged under the project requires additional financing. \n2 The World Bank. 2017.

Overall, the energy sectors of the Central Asian countries are in a phase of dynamic \ntransformations. These are catalyzed by a number of regional initiatives such as the Energy \nSector Coordinating Committee under Central Asian Regional Cooperation (CAREC) and the \nCentral Asian Regional Electricity Market initiative of the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment. ADB is actively involved in a number of regional energy infrastructure projects, \nrefurbishment of CAPS Coordinating Dispatch Center, and other initiatives supporting regional \nenergy trade. Extensive technical expertise and in-depth knowledge of CAPS system is required \nin identification and design of electricity infrastructure projects of regional importance.  \n \nB.
