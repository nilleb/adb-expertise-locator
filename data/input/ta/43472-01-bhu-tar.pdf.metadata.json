INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance1 (TA) will respond to a request by the Government of Bhutan \nfor support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to accelerate and consolidate key aspects \nof its governance and development agenda. The TA for Strengthening Public Management is \nincluded in the Bhutan country operations business plan (2011\u20132013).2 A consultation mission \nin September 2010 and a fact-finding mission in November 2010 formulated the goals and \nstrategies  of  the  TA  and  designed  its  corresponding  activities.  Extensive  discussion  with \ngovernment officials has resulted in mutual agreement on the design and monitoring ramework \n(Appendix 1) and outline terms of references for consultants ( Appendix 3). \n \n2.   The TA supports the government\u2019s priorities outlined in its Tenth Five-Year Plan (2008\u2013\n2013),3 which identifies decentralized governance as a crosscutting development strategy. The \nTA also supports the implementation of Bhutan\u2019s recently drafted local government capacity \ndevelopment strategy4 and a newly proposed municipal finance policy.5 \n \n3.  The TA will build on the work of an ongoing TA project that is delivering leadership and \nmanagement training for government officials,6 and on another TA project on strengthening public \nfinancial management.7 It will support local government finance reforms and the mainstreaming of \nregulatory impact analysis in policy making. The TA will pioneer innovative activities in local \ngovernment finance, e-governance, social audit, civil service, and regulatory reform. \n \n4.  The  TA  supports  ADB\u2019s  Bhutan  country  partnership  strategy.8 By  improving  the \nregulatory regime to allow for local governments to become more self-financing, the TA will \nfoster the strategy\u2019s first pillar of broad-based economic growth. By helping streamline public \nservices and making them more accessible, the TA contributes to its second pillar, inclusive \ndevelopment. The TA\u2019s support for social audits and regulatory impact analysis strengthens \npublic management and contributes to the strategy\u2019s third pillar of good governance.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Bhutan has achieved robust economic growth in the past decade. Its gross domestic \nproduct has grown an average of 7% per annum since 2004. Its per capita gross national \nincome rose almost threefold from $730 in 2000 to $1,900 in 2008. With additional hydropower \nprojects in the pipeline that promise additional revenues, Bhutan\u2019s economic outlook remains \nbright. To ensure that the country\u2019s growth is balanced and sustainable, the government is \npursuing a development agenda anchored on both democratization and decentralization.  \n \n6.  Since the country\u2019s transition to parliamentary democracy in 2008, the government has \nadopted additional mechanisms to institutionalize decentralized public management. Notable \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 December 2010 \n2  ADB. 2010.

The government is also developing a framework for assigning responsibilities to \nlocal bodies to promote appropriate usage of block grants and to foster greater accountability.  \n \n7.  As it embarks on an agenda of development through decentralization, the government \nrecognizes its enormous challenges. Chief among these are weak institutional and human \nresource  capacity  at  local  levels,  the  inadequate  resource  base  of  local  economies  and \ninstitutions, cumbersome and bureaucratic administrative systems, and procedures that have \nhampered the efficiency and effectiveness of local administration (footnote 3, p.70). At the same \ntime, Bhutan\u2019s country competitiveness needs major improvement. Its ranking in the worldwide \nDoing Business survey remains in the bottom quarter (ranking 142 in the 2011 report).9 In South \nAsia, Bhutan only ranked better than Afghanistan in the 2010 survey.  \n   \n8.  To  meet  these  challenges,  the government  is  pursuing  various  strategies  under  its \ncurrent 5-year plan. While the strategies are well-defined, major gaps exist in terms of financing, \ntechnology, accountability, regulation, and capacity. The TA will work to fill these gaps through \nactivities to advance policy reforms in local government finance, apply information technology to \nenhance public services, improve bureaucratic performance through social audit mechanisms, \nand foster institutional efficiencies by streamlining policies and regulations. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be more effective public sector management at the national \nand local levels in Bhutan to improve social welfare and the business environment. This impact \nwill be measured by (i) two indicators in Bhutan\u2019s global ranking in the Doing Business survey\u2014\n\u2015starting a business\u2016 and \u2015paying taxes\u2016; and (ii) the expected increase in the percentage of \ncitizens expressing satisfaction with the delivery of government services. \n   \n10.   The outcome of the TA will be enhanced capacity of the national and local governments \nto deliver sustainable public services that are responsive to the needs and preferences of \ncitizens and businesses. This outcome will be measured by an increased share of municipal \ntaxes in national revenue collection, an increase in the number of streamlined government \nservices  accessible  online,  and  the  number  of  amended  or  abrogated  central  government \nregulations affecting local bodies as a result of regulatory impact analysis. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  To achieve the above impact and outcome, the four TA components will work to (i) \nadvance local government finance reforms, (ii) enhance government performance through e-\ngovernance and citizens\u2019 participation, (iii) strengthen civil service reforms through management \ntraining, and (iv) improve regulatory capacity and reduce the government\u2019s regulatory burden.  \n \n12.  Component 1: Advancing local government finance reforms. The share of municipal \ntaxes in Bhutan\u2019s national revenues is a minuscule 0.07%.10 The government realizes that \neffective fiscal decentralization will require local governments to build their capacity to self-\n                                                \n9  International  Finance  Corporation.

National Revenue \nReport 2008\u20132009. Bhutan.  \n ", "3 \n \nfinance their activities. With support from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), the Department of \nUrban Development and Engineering Services (DUDES) of the Ministry of Works and Human \nSettlements  has  proposed  a  municipal  finance  policy  to  the  cabinet.  The  DUDES  is \nspearheading  this  policy  because  the  reforms  are  targeted  at  the  country\u2019s  four  Class  A \nthromdes (municipalities), which are subject to DUDES\u2019 regulatory jurisdiction.11 The proposed \npolicy, now under review, seeks to enhance the revenues of these municipalities by rationalizing \nthe local revenue structure (taxes, fees, and charges) and maximizing the use of public assets. \nThe  TA  will  help  operationalize  this  policy,  applying  best  practices  in  land  valuation,  and \nupdating property tax rates. In consultation with the National Land Commission (NLC), the TA \nwill also assist DUDES in reviewing the land registration process in municipalities to ensure it \nbecomes more efficient and well linked to automation efforts of the NLC and the G2C project. \n \n13.  The TA will assist the MOF in reviewing the requirements of local government finance for \nthe dzongkhags (districts) and the gewogs (village groups) and in formulating options for a more \ncoherent policy framework. Following the expected implementation of the municipal finance \npolicy,12 the TA will also help the MOF formulate options for an updated regulatory framework \nfor  local  government  finance.  The  MOF  recognizes  that  the  strength  and  sustainability  of \ndecentralization depends greatly on the ability of local bodies to generate their own revenues.  \n \n14.  Component  2:  Enhancing  government  performance  using  e-governance  and \ncitizens\u2019  participation.  International  experience  has  shown  that  information  and \ncommunications technology tools can introduce significant efficiencies, increase access, and \nlower costs in the delivery of public services. It has also demonstrated that public service \ndelivery can be enhanced through citizens\u2019 feedback mechanisms similar to those of customer \nrelationship management innovations in the private sector. In this respect, the TA will work with \nthe  Department  of  Local  Governance  of  the  Ministry  of  Home  and  Cultural  Affairs\u2014in \ncooperation with the local development division of the Gross National Happiness Commission\u2014\nto implement innovations in e-governance and citizens\u2019 participation.  \n \n15.  E-governance is a government priority because it promises high accessibility to, and \nbetter responsiveness of, public services at comparatively low costs. The TA will help evaluate \nand monitor the design and operations of the e-governance portal of the government-to-citizen \n(G2C) project, which will provide citizens with web access to a wide range of public services. \nThe  G2C  project  has  identified  the  top  75  commonly  used  government  services  to  be \nstreamlined and offered through the portal.13 The G2C project will procure the needed hardware \nand software and ADB will provide technical expertise for quality control in procurement, design, \nand delivery. This activity will be linked to a separate ADB TA to be proposed in 2011 for a tax \nadministration management information system (TAMIS) for the Department of Revenue and \nCustoms (DRC). The e-filing and other services in the TAMIS will be included in the G2C portal \nand the TA will help procure equipment for the system.  \n \n16.  Citizens\u2019 participation is also a government priority because it is seen as essential to \ntransparency and accountability. In this regard, the TA will support the conduct of citizens\u2019 \nfeedback surveys for participatory policy development, implementation, and monitoring. It will \nhelp the government design survey instruments, train interviewers, and analyze survey data. \nBaseline surveys will be conducted during the TA inception. The focus will be the services \n                                                \n11 These thromdes are Gelephu, Phuentsholing, Samdrup Jongkhar, and Thimphu. \n12 See footnote 4. At present, the revenues of the dzongkhags and gewogs come mainly from an intergovernmental \ntransfer system that started in 2000\u20132001.  \n13 These 75 services are drawn from the work of five ministries and one autonomous agency. For a list of these \nproposed e-services, see http://www.g2c.gov.bt/sites/default/files/documents/list-of-simplified-G2C-services.pdf.  \n ", "4 \n \nprovided by the G2C project. To measure performance relative to baseline figures, the TA will \nprovide support for the conduct of additional surveys at the midpoint and in the last quarter of \nthe project. The findings of these activities will be reported through mass media to foster greater \npublic knowledge, bureaucratic accountability, and performance competition among agencies. \n \n17.  Component  3:  Strengthening  civil  service  through  management  development \ntraining.  Proper  implementation  of government  policies  and  programs  depends greatly  on \npersonnel capacity. The TA will continue management development training for central and \nlocal officials organized by the Royal Institute of Management (RIM) under ADB\u2019s ongoing TA \n(footnote 6). The TA will support faculty development and the design of modules as well as a \nsecondment program that will place national officials in dzongkhags and have officials from \ndzongkhags  work  at  central  offices.  This  secondment  program  is  being  piloted  under  the \nongoing TA. The TA will review the pilot program and the results will inform the design of the \nfollow-on  program.  The  MOF  asked  that  the  secondment  include  officials  from  various \nministries. RIM faculty members could be considered for secondment as well. Through this \nsecondment program, the TA will deepen the officials\u2019 capability for implementing policies and \nprograms. \n \n18.  Component 4: Improving regulatory capacity and reducing regulatory burdens on \ngovernment agencies. The government is cognizant of its policy gaps and inconsistencies and \nof regulatory burdens on ministries and agencies delivering public services. As a result of ADB\u2019s \nTA on small and medium-sized enterprises, the government has mandated that policy makers \nbe schooled in regulatory impact analysis (RIA).14 The TA will support capacity building for basic \nand advanced RIA courses for policy and planning development officers and legal officers of \nministries as well as incoming civil servants. Support for external training for the RIA task force \nmay also be provided. RIA training will be delivered by RIM, select officials, and consultants.  \n \n19.  In  terms  of  impact,  the  TA  assumes  that  government  support  for  improving \nadministrative  performance  will  be  sustained.  The  risk  is  that  changes  in  leadership  in \ngovernment agencies could reduce support for the TA. In terms of outcome, the TA assumes \nthat central and local governments will be able to work together in advancing reforms. The risk \nis that government priorities could shift due to unexpected fiscal pressures and insufficient \nresources to sustain service innovations. The TA will mitigate these risks by broadening TA \nownership across key agencies and by partnering with the externally funded G2C project. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $890,000. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). ADB will \nprovide the equivalent of $850,000 and the government will finance the balance, equivalent to \n$40,000. The financing will cover the cost of a consulting firm that will implement the TA as well \nas  procurement  of  equipment.  The  government  contribution  will  be  in  the  form  of  staff \nremuneration, office space for consultants, and facilities for trainings. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The executing agency will be the MOF. The MOF will appoint a project director to chair \nthe project steering committee. The project will have four implementing agencies, each of which \n                                                \n14  ADB. 2007.

These will be the MOF for \ncomponent 1 (including procurement of equipment), the Department of Local Governance for \ncomponent 2, the Royal Civil Service Commission for component 3, and RIM for component 4. \nThe TA is expected to start in January 2011 and end in December 2013. \n \n22.  A consulting firm will be contracted to implement the TA. The firm will field a project \nmanagement specialist (national, 12 person-months) who will serve as project manager. For \ncomponent 1, the firm will field a local government finance specialist (international, 6 person-\nmonths) to work with the MOF and the DUDES in operationalizing aspects of the proposed \nmunicipal finance policy. The specialist will conduct institutional, policy, and regulatory reviews \nof the local government finance sector and draft options for enhancing local government finance.  \n \n23.  For component 2, the firm will field an e-governance specialist (international, 4 person-\nmonths) and a system engineering and network specialist (international, 6 person-months) who \nwill work with the G2C project in evaluating and monitoring the implementation of G2C initiatives. \nBoth specialists will also work in setting up a web portal to give citizens easy access and better \ntransparency  in  tax  transactions.  A  public  sector  management  specialist  (international,  2 \nperson-months) will assist the G2C project in the automation of land registration and in the \ngeneral change management needs of the TA. In addition, the firm will field a survey research \nspecialist  (international,  2  person-months)  who  will  design  survey  questionnaires,  train \ninterviewers, supervise the surveys, and present findings. For component 3, the firm will support \nRIM and consultants as needed for the training. It will assist the Royal Civil Service Commission \nin the design of its secondment program. For component 4, the firm will field a regulatory reform \nspecialist (international, 2 person-months) who will lead the design and delivery of RIA training. \nThe specialist will conduct a regulatory analysis of policies governing local administration and \nprepare a paper on regulatory reforms to enhance local government performance.  \n \n24.  The consulting firm will be engaged using ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The selection will be quality- and cost-based selection \nusing the 80:20 quality\u2013cost ratio and will call for simplified technical proposals. Procurement of \nequipment will be carried out by the MOF in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time). At the end of the TA, the equipment will be turned over to \nthe  MOF,  which  has  demonstrated  capacity  to  operate  information  technology  systems.15 \nDisbursement under the TA will be made in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n25.  Workshops  and  booklets  on  best  practices  and  lessons  learned  in  the  TA  will  be \npublished in Bhutan. These workshops and publications will be organized with technical inputs \nfrom ADB staff. Technical assistance reports will be made publicly available on the ADB website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n26.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $850,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bhutan for Strengthening Public Management, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board. \n                                                \n15  Under the MOF, the DRC established the Bhutan automated customs system in 2001, the revenue management \nsystem in 2002, and the sales tax system in 2009.
