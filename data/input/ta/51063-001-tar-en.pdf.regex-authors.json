Analysis of Key Issues \n1.  As the youngest country in Asia and the Pacific, Timor-Leste has made excellent progress \nin peace building and state building. However, efforts to improve service delivery have been \nhampered by weaknesses in the systems for public investment management (PIM) and gaps in \nsector policies and plans. This Technical Assistance Cluster (TA) will provide carefully targeted \nsupport for the strengthening of PIM systems and the policies and plans for transport, energy, \nwater and urban services and education. These sectors were identified as priorities in ADB\u2019s \nTimor-Leste country partnership strategy 2016-2020. TA activities will be linked to ongoing and \nplanned ADB transactions and will support feasibility studies and due diligence for at least two \ninvestment projects that have been identified as shared priorities of the Government of Timor-\nLeste and the Asian Development Bank.  \n \n2.  Public investment management. During 2007-2016, public expenditures on capital and \ndevelopment programs grew at an average rate of 33% per annum as the government used \nincome from off-shore oil and gas production to finance an ambitious investment program. Public \ninvestments have produced notable improvements in basic infrastructure but the surge in public \nspending  has  also  strained  recently  established  systems for  project  selection,  preparation, \nimplementation, and evaluation. Many key PIM institutions were established as part of a 2011 \nreform  program.  This  includes  the  Infrastructure  Fund,  which  is  a  financing  window  for \ninfrastructure projects with a value of more than $1 million, the major projects secretariat (MPS), \nwhich oversees project appraisal and selection, the national development agency which provides \nproject supervision and quality assurance, and the national procurement commission.  Further \nadjustments were made in 2015 with the establishment of a Ministry of Planning and Strategic \nInvestment to oversee key aspects of PIM, and the restructuring of the Infrastructure Fund as an \nautonomous public agency that is managed by the MPS.   \n \n3.  Timor-Leste\u2019s PIM systems are relatively well developed when compared to other fragile \nstates. However, independent assessments have identified several weaknesses which tend to \nreduce the efficiency of public investment.1 Processes for project appraisal and project selection \nhave been established but further work is needed to update the guidelines and ensure that they \nare applied consistently. Project preparation and project selection is undermined by the absence \nof coherent sector strategies and investment plans and by capacity constraints within the line \nministries that submit project proposals to the Infrastructure Fund. There is also a risk that current \nprocesses for project development do not give sufficient consideration to the potential for private \nsector involvement in project financing, operations, and maintenance.2  \n \n4.  There are also important weaknesses at each stage following project selection and \npreparation.  A  significant  proportion  of  capital  works  are  procured  using  non-competitive \nprocesses that reduce the incentives for private sector efficiency. Project implementation is also \nundermined by weaknesses in the systems and capacity for project management and there is \ncurrently no systematic approach to ex-post evaluation of project outcomes. Donor financing can \nhelp to mitigate some of the weaknesses by applying specific requirements to project preparation, \nestablishing  dedicated  project  management  units,  implementing  ex-post  evaluations  and \n                                                \n1 World Bank. 2015. Timor-Leste Public Expenditure Review: Infrastructure. Dili \n2 A specialized unit has been established in the Ministry of Finance to manage public private partnerships (PPPs) but \nthere is scope to strengthen the integration of PPP appraisal and transaction development within line agencies, and \nacross the broader PIM system.  \n ", "2 \nmandating the full use of established systems for procurement, and environmental management. \nHowever, these projects currently account for a limited share of total capital investment.3  There \nare ongoing efforts to mainstream the best practices that are applied by project management units. \nHowever, project implementation can also be affected by weaknesses in national systems that \ncannot be directly addressed through project management units.  \n \n5.  Environmental management and licensing is one area where capacity constraints can lead \nto  delays  in  project  implementation.  The  National  Directorate  of  Pollution  Control  and \nEnvironmental Impact (NDPCEI) of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Environment is mandated \nto implement the Basic Environment Law 2012 and Environmental Licensing Law (ELL).  The ELL \nprocedure is relatively straight forward but can be time consuming and there have recently been \nlong delays in license approvals. Both the law and the implementing regulations may need to be \nupdated to reflect recent changes including the development of on-shore petroleum and mining \nactivities. A small team in NDPCEI is responsible for implementing the law, and reviewing license \napplications. Frequent changes in staffing have led to a loss of capacity that has contributed to \ndelays in the review of license applications. Technical assistance is needed to review and update \nenvironmental  regulations  and  to  increase  capacity  for  reviewing  license  applications  and \nadministering existing licenses.  \n \n6.  As the leading partner for infrastructure development in Timor-Leste, ADB has provided a \nrange of support for the strengthening of PIM systems. During 2011-2014, ADB provided initial \nsupport for the development of MPS\u2019 business processes for project selection and the evaluation \nof PPP opportunities in transport and energy.4 This support was coordinated with support from \nAustralian Aid, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the United States Agency for \nInternational Development. During 2013-2014 ADB provided technical assistance to strengthen \nthe regulatory framework for environment to NDPCEI and assisted in drafting a number of \nregulations  under  the  ELL,  amendments  to  the  ELL,  undertaking  an  institutional  capacity \nassessment, and establishing procedures and systems within NDPCEI for implementing the ELL \n(and proposed regulations).5 More recently, ADB has helped the Ministry of Public Works, \nTransport and Communications to develop and implement a strategic results framework and staff \ncapacity development program.6 A recent assessment of previous ADB support for infrastructure \nmanagement  found  that  ADB  TA  was  successful  in  achieving  the  targeted  outcomes  and \nconfirmed that ADB is well placed to assist with strengthening PIM systems. This and other \nassessments also highlight the importance of providing technical assistance that can respond \nwith flexibility to ongoing changes in institutional arrangements.7  \n \n7.  Sector policies and planning. Timor-Leste\u2019s Strategic Development Plan 2011-2030 \nprovides a high-level framework for development planning and has been supplemented by a high-\nlevel roadmap for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that was approved in \nMay 2017.8  However, at the sector level, there are gaps in policy frameworks, sector plans and \ninstitutional  capacity  that  need  to  be  addressed  before  the  new  SDG  roadmap  can  be \nimplemented.  Gaps  in  sector  policies  and  planning  also  contribute  to  weaknesses  in  the \n                                                \n3 Timor-Leste\u2019s 2017 State Budget envisages that 30.2% of all capital investment during 2017-2021 will be financed \nthrough loans.  \n4  ADB. 2011.

Dili.  \n ", "         3  \nprioritization and selection of public investment projects and can undermine the linkages between \npublic investment in service delivery outcomes. Closing these gaps is essential for successful \nscaling up of investment in sectors such as water and sanitation and education which are key for \nhuman development.  \n \n8.  ADB has made significant contributions to planning and policy development in each of the \nsectors that have been identified in the Timor-Leste country partnership strategy 2016-2020. In \nthe  transport  sector,  ADB  provided  TA  to  support  a  transport  sector  masterplan  and  the \nidentification of institutional reform priorities. In water and urban services ADB has helped to \nprepare masterplans for water supply systems in Dili and four municipal capitals, review tariff \npolicy in Dili, and has contributed to the development of water resource policies. In energy, ADB \nis currently assisting with sector planning, and in education ADB is helping to develop a policy \nand planning framework for the vocationalization of secondary education. \n \n9.  The development of sector policies and plans is not a one-time event and there are \nsignificant unmet needs for technical assistance in each of the sectors that ADB is supporting. \nTimor-Leste\u2019s new SDG roadmap means that there is also an opportunity for more integrated \nplanning approaches. For example, the government has expressed interest in developing a \ntimebound and costed plan for the achievement of SDG 6 that would include a prioritized plan for \ninvestments to upgrade water supply systems. Integrated planning approaches could help to \naccelerate progress towards the achievement of specific development outcomes but will require \nclose  coordination  across  a  range  of  ministries  and  service  delivery  units.  ADB\u2019s  ongoing \nengagement in transport infrastructure, education, energy, and water and urban services, and the \nadditional policy advisory support that is planned through this TA will also contribute to planning \nand implementation of programs for the achievement of SDGs 4,7, 9 and 11.  \n \n \nB.  Justification for Cluster Modality \n \n10.  The  proposed  transaction  TA  cluster  was  included  in  ADB\u2019s  Timor-Leste  country \noperations and business plan 2017-2019.The TA will provide capacity building and policy advisory \nsupport for ADB\u2019s existing portfolio of ongoing investment projects and will provide policy advice \nand project preparation support for selected proposed projects. The ongoing and ensuing projects \nthat will be supported through the TA cluster include projects in the transport, education, water \nand urban services, and energy sectors. A full list of the ongoing and ensuing projects that may \nbe supported through the TA is presented in appendix 1.  \n \n11.  Implementation of ongoing projects in transport, education and water and urban services \nis progressing well. However, policy and institutional gaps can create short term bottlenecks in \nimplementation and can also threaten the long-term sustainability of project outcomes. Gaps in \npolicies, sector plans, and institutional capacity can also constrain project identification and \npreparation. In addition to supporting the implementation of ongoing projects, the TA cluster will \nassist with project identification and planning, the completion of pre-feasibility assessments and \nfull project preparation for two ensuing projects that have passed through the pre-feasibility \nassessment phase. Project identification and pre-feasibility assessments will be completed under \na single sub-project while detailed project preparation will be completed through separate TA \nsubprojects. The cluster modality will help to ensure that ADB support is well integrated and can \nachieve synergies between sector oriented policy and planning, project preparation, and more \ncross cutting support for public investment management.  \n \n \n ", "4 \nC.  Outcome and Outputs \n12.  Overall outcome. The overall outcome of the TA cluster is improvement in the planning, \nidentification, implementation and management of infrastructure and infrastructure services in \nTimor-Leste. Each TA subproject will generally deliver all or some of the following outputs, as \nspecified by each transaction TA subproject proposal. \n \n13.   Output 1: Improved capacity for public investment management. The TA will support \nthe updating of guidelines for appraisal and selection of public investment projects; provide \ntraining and capacity building on the use of the updated guidelines; support the updating of \nregulations for social and environmental safeguards; assist with implementation of updated social \nand environmental safeguard regulations; and help to address other bottlenecks to project \nimplementation and project sustainability as they arise.9  \n \n14.  Output 2: Improved sector policy and planning. The TA will provide expert inputs to \nsupport development of a national level plan to achieve the SDG goals on water and sanitation \n(SDG 6); provide advice on policy frameworks for technical and vocational education; and provide \ntimely transaction related advisory services in response to emerging issues in the transport, water \nand urban services, energy, and education sectors.  This will include policy advice on sector \nplanning and regulation and the completion of pre-feasibility assessments for two or more \ncandidate investment projects.  \n \n15.  Output 3: Project feasibility studies and due diligence completed. The TA will support \nthe completion of feasibility studies and project due diligence for two agreed investment projects. \nThe indicative planning is for this to include one transport project and one education project. \nHowever, the final selection of projects is subject to review by ADB and the Government of Timor-\nLeste and could change to include projects in energy or water and urban services. Project \npreparation under output 3 will be closely linked to relevant activities under outputs 1 and 2 in \norder to maximize the overall contribution to capacity development.  \n \n \nD.  Cost and Indicative Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,200,000, of which $2,100,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). Detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing arrangements will be presented in each TA cluster subproject proposal submitted for \napproval.   \n \n17.  For each TA subproject, the government will provide counterpart support in the form of \ncounterpart staff, and office accommodation, and other in-kind contributions. The government \nwas informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will administer the TA cluster. Each of the TA subprojects will be administered by \none PARD division. ADB\u2019s Timor-Leste Resident Mission will be the principal division for TA \nadministration and will administer TA subproject 1 (outputs 1 and 2) with support from the relevant \n                                                \n9 In order to avoid duplication, the support for ongoing projects that is provided under Output 1 will be designed to \ncomplement the consulting services are incorporated within ongoing investment projects.  \n ", "         5  \nsector and thematic specialists from the Pacific Transport, Energy and Natural Resources Division \n(PATE), and the Pacific Urban, Social Development, and Public Management Division (PAUS). \nOutput 3 will be delivered through additional subprojects which will be prepared by ADB\u2019s sector \nspecialists. The selection, supervision and evaluation of consultants, for output 3 (subprojects 2 \nand 3) will be managed by relevant staff from PATE and PAUS. Each TA subproject will be \nsubmitted for approval to the PARD Director General in accordance with the business process for \ntransaction TA cluster processing. Each TA subproject will start only after the project concept of \nthe corresponding ensuing project is approved by ADB   \n \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements for the Technical Assistance Cluster \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  January 2018 \u2013 December 2020 \nperiod for the TA cluster \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Finance  \nImplementing agency  Asian Development Bank, Pacific Department \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  Subprojects. The TA cluster will be implemented through 3 TA subprojects as described \nin Appendix 2. Since there are linkages between the activities under outputs 1 and 2 and the \nactivities are contemporaneous, they have been packaged as a single subproject.  Conversely, \nthe projects to be prepared under Output 3 may not be prepared at the same time and so project \npreparation has been separated into separate subprojects for each ensuing project. Opportunities \nto package project preparation into a single sub-project will be reviewed at the time of sub-project \npreparation.  Each  TA  subproject  will  be  designed  in  accordance  with  the  general  output \ndescriptions (paras. 13-15) as and when needed during the implementation period, and will be \napproved by the PARD Director General.   \n \nTable 2: Indicative Implementation Period and Budget Allocation for Subprojects \nItem  Subproject Title  Implementation Period  Budget ($\u2019000) \nSubproject 1  Policies  and  Planning  for  Public  Q2 2018 \u2013 Q4 2020  1,200 \nInvestment  \nSubproject 2  Project Preparation I \u2013 Workforce and  To be completed by Q4 2020  500 \nSkills Development Project \nSubproject 3  Project Preparation II  \u2013  Sustainable  To be completed by Q4 2020  400 \nTransport Project \n \n20.  Consulting services. The TA will be delivered by two firms, two national consultants, and \nup to 11 international consultants. Subproject 1 will be implemented with a total of 48 person-\nmonths of national consultant inputs and 31 person-months of international consultant inputs. \nNational consultants will support coordination of TA activities, including the strengthening of public \ninvestment management systems, and development of sector policies and investment plans. \nInternational consultant inputs will be used to update national guidelines for project preparation \nand appraisal, support the roll-out of updated guidelines and address other weaknesses in public \ninvestment management systems. International consultant inputs will also be used to provide \nexpert advice on sector policies and plans for transport, energy, water and urban services, and \n ", "6 \neducation.10 Subprojects 2 and 3 will be implemented by one or more firms who will be recruited \nusing the quality and cost based selection modality. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in \nline with ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the associated \nproject administration instructions or staff instructions. The estimated cost and requisite fields of \nexpertise are indicative and estimates will be finalized prior to approval of each TA subproject in \nconsultation with the government during follow-up missions \n \n \nF.  Governance  \n \n21.  Since ADB will administer the TA, the financial management, procurement, and integrity \nrisks during TA implementation are assessed to be low. However, thorough risk assessments for \nfinancial  management,  procurement,  and  integrity  for  ensuing  investment  projects  will  be \nconducted under the TA.  \n \n \nII.
