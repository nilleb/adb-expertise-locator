An initial environmental examination was undertaken; the \nAssessment  summary is a core appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The Project will support aquatic resource development and quality \nimprovement to enhance food security and reduce poverty, especially \nin rural areas. Project interventions will encourage community-based \nand private-sector-led development of the subsector. The focus of the \nProject will be to develop and demonstrate models that can be easily \nreplicated  by  community-based  organizations  and  by  private \nentrepreneurs.  With  this  in  view,  the  project  design  centers  on \ndevelopment of small-scale, low-cost infrastructure at the community \nlevel,  and  supporting  entrepreneurship  development  by  providing \naccess  to  (i)  technology,  (ii)  technical  expertise,  (iii)  information \nsystems, (iv) credit, and (v) extension services. Through institutional \nstrengthening  activities,  the  Project  will  assist  the  National \nAquaculture Development Authority (NAQDA) to build its technical \nand financial capacity to support these developments, and to become \na financially self-sustaining organization. \n   \nRationale  Fish are the principal source of protein for Sri Lanka\u2019s population, and \nplay a vital role in meeting basic nutritional and livelihood needs. \nExtensive water bodies constitute a potentially rich source of food and \nincome for the rural population living in their proximity. However, in \n2000, only 12% of the country\u2019s fish production came from inland \nfisheries and aquaculture. The production potential of the freshwater \nand brackish water resources has not been optimally utilized due to \nseveral factors, including lack of (i) fish seed for stocking, (ii) trained \nextension staff and outreach, and (iii) medium-term credit to finance \nincreased production. \n \nAn analysis of consumption trends shows a growing demand for fish \nin both rural and urban markets. Significant opportunities are also \nemerging for sale of freshwater fish and aquatic products beyond \ntraditional local markets. Both community-based and private sector \ninitiatives  and  interest  exist  to  avail  of  these  opportunities,  given \nappropriate  support  to  invest  in  developing  inland  fisheries  and \naquaculture production and marketing. \n   \nObjectives   The Project will promote market-driven and sustainable management \nof inland fisheries and aquaculture through resource development \nand  quality  improvement.  It  will  initially  be  implemented  in  nine \ndistricts in six provinces in the dry zone. Model aquaculture and fish \nprocessing enterprises will be developed, which may be replicated in \nother parts of the country, including the north and east, where the \nwater resources exist.  ", "iv   \n \nThe Project is organized in five parts: inland fisheries and aquaculture \ndevelopment, fish quality improvement and marketing, facilitation of \naccess to credit, institutional strengthening, and project management. \nThe successful implementation of these is expected to result in the \nfollowing outcomes: (i) increased production of freshwater fish and \nother aquatic products for the rural, urban, and export markets; (ii) \nimproved  quality  and  increased  consumption  of  inland  fish;  (iii) \nimproved access to credit for use in inland fisheries and aquaculture; \nand  (iv)  strengthened  capacity  of  NAQDA  and  other  sector \ninstitutions. Increased investment by small- and medium-scale private \nentrepreneurs  will  be  encouraged,  and  community-based  fisheries \nmanagement will be strengthened. \n   \nCost Estimates  The Project is estimated to cost $30.0 million equivalent, of which \n$8.6 million is foreign exchange cost and $21.4 million equivalent is \nlocal currency cost. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million)\nForeign \nSource  Local Currency  Total Cost Percent\nExchange \nADB  8.6  11.4  20.0  67 \nCBOs  0.0  0.7  0.7  2 \nPrivate Sector  0.0  1.2  1.2  4 \nNDTF  0.0  1.6  1.6  5 \nGovernment  0.0  6.5  6.5  22 \n         \nTotal  8.6  21.4  30.0  100 \n         \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CBO = community-based organization, \nNDTF = National Development Trust Fund. \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n   \n   \nLoan Amount and  A  loan  of  \u00a5726.4  million  ($6.2  million)  from  the  ordinary  capital \nTerms  resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility.

Increased food \nsupply together with higher income will improve nutrition and health, \nas will improved processing facilities using hygienic and sanitary fish-\nhandling practices. As women will be specifically involved in these \nactivities, the improvements will have a direct impact on their families \nand living conditions. Specific subgroups of the population will be \ntargeted to provide employment opportunities in rural areas where \nthese are scarce, and allow these poorer groups to secure an income \nand establish themselves as satisfied members of their communities. \nPoverty incidence in the project area is expected to be reduced to \n23% by the end of the Project. \n \nThe Project\u2019s support to developing public-private partnerships will \nprovide new employment opportunities and marketing linkages, to \ndeliver economic benefits from increased production of freshwater \nfish and aquatic products. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  vii", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed loans \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Aquatic Resource Development and \nQuality Improvement Project (Appendix 1). \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The Sri Lanka fisheries sector has three production subsectors: (i) coastal fisheries; (ii) \noffshore fisheries; and (iii) inland fisheries, including aquaculture in both freshwater and brackish \nwater areas. Although the fisheries sector contributed only 2.6\u20133.0% annually to the country\u2019s \ngross national product during 1995\u20132000, it plays a vital role in meeting the basic nutritional and \nlivelihood  needs  of  the  population.  Fish  are  the  principal  source  of  protein  for  the  country\u2019s \npopulation, accounting for about 60% of the total animal protein intake, on average, and up to 85% \nin the rural areas. Annual per capita fish consumption, estimated at 15\u201316 kilograms (kg), is lower \nthan the 21 kg recommended by the Sri Lanka Medical Research Institute. Over 360,000 tons (t) of \nfish are consumed annually in Sri Lanka, only 78% of which is from domestic production, the rest is \nsupplied through imports, mainly in dried form. Nevertheless, the country\u2019s balance of trade in fish \nand fish products is positive, with exports exceeding imports by about SLRs5 billion in 2000. \n \n3.  In 2000, official estimates of total fish production in Sri Lanka were 304,380 t. However, \nonly about 12% (or 36,700 t) of this came from inland fisheries and aquaculture, while the rest was \nfrom coastal and offshore fisheries. Production of the inland fisheries and aquaculture subsector \nrecovered from a low of 12,000 t in 1994 to the 2000 level in 6 years, although this is still below the \nhighest annual production of 38,190 t achieved in 1990. The sharp fall in production from 1990 to \n1994 is attributed to the abrupt withdrawal of state assistance to the subsector in 1990, until it was \nresumed in 1994.  \n \n4.  Consumption trends from 1986\u20131997 show a growing demand for both freshwater and \nmarine fish, in urban and rural markets. Total demand for fish increased by 13% from 102,966 t to \n116,144 t, with demand for marine and freshwater fish increasing by 14% and 7%. Opportunities \nare emerging for marketing freshwater fish beyond the rural areas where these are commonly \nproduced for home consumption. Per capita consumption of freshwater fish in urban areas has \nshown an increasing trend, despite distribution and marketing constraints that limit movement of \nthe commodity from the reservoirs to markets in other districts where freshwater fish is in short \nsupply but in great demand (Appendix 2).  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n5.  Extensive water bodies constitute a potentially rich source of food and income for the rural \npopulation living in their proximity. However, widespread poverty and protein scarcity persist due to \nlack  of  sustainable  development  and  management  of  these  water  bodies.  A  rapid  social \nassessment survey during project preparation1 found that a third of rural households living near the \nperennial and seasonal tanks fall below the poverty threshold. Of these, more than 60% are \ninvolved,  on  a  full-  or  part-time  basis,  in  freshwater  fish  culture  and  earn  annual  household \nincomes of less than SLRs30,000. Among these marginal rural communities, the consumption of \n                                                 \n1  Project preparatory technical assistance (TA) was provided under TA: ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Preparing the Aquatic Resource Development and Quality Improvement \nProject. Manila.  ", "2   \nprotein is only one third that in urban areas, and the amount of fish consumed is just about half that \nof urban communities. For these households, the food bill takes up more than half their small \nincome. Food security for the rural poor means providing them with means and resources to \nproduce food for both home consumption and marketable surpluses. \n \n6.  A large proportion of the rural population lives in the vicinity of perennial reservoirs and \nseasonal tanks, which constitute such a resource. However, the production potential of these water \nbodies, particularly the minor reservoirs and seasonal tanks, has not been optimally utilized due to \nthe severe shortage of freshwater fish seed for stocking\u2014and subsequent harvesting\u2014for food \nand cash. This short supply of fingerlings is attributed to several factors, including (i) limited production \ncapacity  of  existing  government  hatcheries,  (ii)  inability  of  most  small-scale  inland  fisheries \noperators to finance the purchase of fingerlings, and (iii) lack of trained personnel to extend seed \nproduction and rearing technology to inland fishers as well as rural communities at large. \n \n7.  A  regular  and  adequate  supply  of  production  inputs  is  needed:  (i)  fish  fingerlings  for \nstocking  in  tanks  and  growout  in  ponds,  and  (ii)  extension  support  and  credit  assistance  to \ncommunities to enable them to manage a new economic activity. This will require establishing \nmore fish hatcheries, as well as developing mechanisms for effective and efficient transfer of \ntechnology from government extension centers to small fishers and rural communities that will \neventually take the lead in producing fingerlings for rearing to market size. The formal and informal \nprivate sector can play a key role in bringing about increased production of inland fish and other \naquatic  products  for  the  rural,  urban,  and  export  markets.  Adequate  social  preparation  and \ncommunity organization of small fishers, as well as extension of appropriate technology to private \nentrepreneurs need time. Therefore, public sector institutions will initially need to be strengthened, \nto enable them to provide technical support to community-based organizations (CBOs) and the \nprivate sector for inland fish production, postharvest processing, and marketing. \n \n8.  The National Aquaculture Development Authority (NAQDA) was established in 1999 as the \nlead government agency to develop and regulate inland fisheries and aquaculture in the country. \nNAQDA\u2019s technical, financial, and project implementation capacities need to be strengthened, and \nthe law governing its existence and operations amended, to enable it to fully exercise its mandate. \nOther agencies and entities involved in the subsector will also need to be strengthened, especially \nCBOs.2 Extensive social mobilization and training efforts are required to ensure active involvement \nand participation of CBOs in inland fisheries and aquaculture enterprises, as well as in community-\nbased  fisheries  management.  As  demand  grows,  awareness  among  stakeholders  of  the \nachievable  production  potential  of  these  water  bodies  will  have  to  be  developed,  and  their \ncommitment to sustainable development and management of these resources secured. \n \n9.  The  proposed  Project  will  promote  sustainable  development  of  inland  fisheries  and \naquaculture. It will be the first major initiative in inland fisheries and aquaculture in Sri Lanka, after \nthe completion of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed Aquaculture Development Project \nin 1991.3 Based on lessons learned from this and other projects, the Project will adopt a phased \napproach using demonstration facilities before full-scale implementation of identified aquaculture \nenterprises (Appendix 3 provides details on recent external assistance to the sector). The Project \nwill  also  promote  the  active  participation  of  CBOs  in  the  choice  of  assistance,  their  direct \n                                                 \n2  These include fisheries cooperative societies, fisheries management committees, and aquaculture management \ncommittees. \n3  ADB. 1983.

", "  3\ncontribution to capital investment, and their full responsibility for operation and maintenance of \nproject-delivered assets. It will provide social preparation and training, with the assistance of local \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), to ensure that public support is effective and sustainable \nbeyond the life of the Project. \n \n10.  The Project is in line with the operations of ADB in the fisheries sector, which are steered \nby the objectives of resource sustainability, equity in balancing interests of various resource users, \nand efficiency in developing and managing aquatic resources. ADB\u2019s fisheries policy supports (i) \nstocking reservoirs to support sustainable increases in fish production, (ii) applying extensive fish \nfarming  technologies,  (iii)  developing  ecologically  and  economically  sound  aquaculture \nmanagement  systems  for  fish  production,  (iv)  building  capacity  and  providing  institutional \nstrengthening,  (v)  assisting  governments  to  promote  participatory  formulation  of  fisheries \nmanagement programs by fishing communities, (vi) supporting people-based initiatives for self-\nimposed fishing restrictions and community monitoring for resource utilization, (vii) training or \ninvolving NGOs in social preparation and community organizing, and (viii) establishing national \nfisheries databases for management purposes. \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s operations in Sri Lanka are guided by the country operational strategy finalized in \n1999. The strategy focuses on assisting the country\u2019s poverty reduction efforts through improved \nefficiency, more sustainable pro-poor growth, and better development opportunities for the poor. \nThe country strategy and program update (2002\u20132004), developed in 2001 in close consultation \nwith  the  Government  and  all  stakeholders  including  other  funding  agencies,  confirms  this \napproach.  A  Poverty  Partnership  Agreement4  signed  on  8  March  2002  reiterates  ADB\u2019s \ncommitment to support Government mechanisms to promote an enabling environment for a higher \nrate of growth in a sustainable manner and with balanced regional development. ADB's support for \naquatic  resource  development  and  quality  improvement  will  boost  generation  of  productive \nemployment  opportunities  and  increase  rural  incomes.  The  intervention  recognizes  that  both \ninvestment, and policy and institutional development are required to enhance productivity and \nincrease employment opportunities for the poor. \n \n12.  The Project is complementary to ongoing ADB loan-funded projects and is supportive of \ngovernment poverty reduction programs. Several government-funded and community-led initiatives \nare currently being implemented to empower the poor to reenter the economic mainstream. In \ncooperation with NGOs and CBOs, the Government provides seed capital and matching grants to \ncommunity-based initiatives aimed at helping specific target groups of very poor communities. \nThese  programs  include  microfinance  schemes  aimed  at  promoting  income-generating,  self-\nemployment enterprises for the rural poor, including in remote inland areas. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n13.  The goal of the Project is to improve food security and reduce poverty, especially in rural \nareas.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  achieving  this  goal  by  promoting  market-driven  and \nsustainable management of inland fisheries and aquaculture through resource development and \nquality improvement. The Project will initially be implemented in nine districts in six provinces, \nprimarily in the country\u2019s dry zone: (i) Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa in North Central Province, \n(ii) Kurunegala and Puttalam in Northwestern Province, (iii) Nuwara Eliya in Central Province, (iv) \nRatnapura in Sabaragamuwa Province, (v) Badulla and Moneragala in Uva Province, and (vi) \n                                                 \n4  This was based on (i) 1999 country operational strategies, (ii) results of a poverty analysis conducted during July-\nSeptember 2000, and (iii) outcomes of the High-Level Forum on Poverty Reduction held on 23 March 2001. ", "4   \nHambantota in Southern Province. Sites have also been identified in other districts, including \nAmparai,  Batticaloa  and  Vavuniya  in  the  north  and  east,  which  can  be  developed  when  the \nsituation permits. Model aquaculture and fish-processing enterprises to be developed under the \nProject may be replicated in other parts of the country, including the north and east, where the \nwater resources exist and the models are applicable. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n14.  The Project is structured in five parts: inland fisheries and aquaculture development, fish \nquality improvement and marketing, facilitation of access to credit, institutional strengthening, and \nproject management. The successful implementation of these is expected to result in the following \noutcomes: (i) increased production of freshwater fish and other aquatic products for the rural, \nurban, and export markets; (ii) improved quality and increased consumption of inland fish; (iii) \nimproved  access  to  credit  for  use  in  inland  fisheries  and  aquaculture;  and  (iv)  strengthened \ncapacity of NAQDA and other sector institutions. \n \n1.  Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Development \n15.  This component will bring about increased production of freshwater fish and other aquatic \nproducts. While the bulk of the projected fish production will be sold domestically in both rural and \nurban markets, ornamental fish and red tilapia fillets (to be produced by private enterprises in \nassociation with NAQDA) will be produced mainly for the export market. The participation of small \nfishers through CBOs will be promoted with the help of NGOs to be contracted by the Project. \nIncreased investment by small- and medium-scale private entrepreneurs will be encouraged, and \nindustry partners will be selected to participate in partnerships with NAQDA in the implementation \nof  identified  aquaculture  enterprises.5  These  activities  are  organized  in  five  subcomponents, \ndescribed in the following paragraphs.  \n \n16.  Fish  Production  Enhancement.  As  the  major  and  medium  perennial  reservoirs  are \nassessed to be near their maximum production limits, the expansion of inland fisheries will rely \nprimarily on the minor perennial reservoirs and seasonal tanks, through the introduction of culture-\nbased fisheries. About 2,000 hectares (ha) of minor reservoirs and 600 ha of seasonal tanks are \ntargeted for development each year, for a total area coverage of about 10,000 ha and 3,000 ha of \nminor reservoirs and seasonal tanks, respectively, in 5 years.6 Management of minor perennial and \nseasonal tanks will be the responsibility of CBOs, with technical support from NAQDA and its \nregional extension offices (REOs). Local NGOs will be contracted to work closely with NAQDA \nextension personnel and other government agencies involved to (i) identify the low-income fishers, \n                                                 \n5  Private sector partners to be selected should: (i) be a registered company in Sri Lanka; (ii) have capital assets of \nSLRs5 million\u201310 million or net worth of SLRs 3 million\u20135 million; (iii) have audited financial statements for the last 3 \nyears (except for new enterprises); (iv) preferably have continuous operations in aquaculture or related fields over the \nlast 5 years; (v) have 5\u201310 regular personnel, including at least one technical staff with adequate training and \nexperience in a relevant field; (vi) preferably have experience in similar operations; (vii) be willing to share information \ngenerated through the demonstration enterprise; (viii) be willing to participate in dissemination and transfer of \ntechnology;  and  (ix)  be  willing  to  set  up  environmental  mitigation  and  social  safeguard  (including  involuntary \nresettlement) measures as part of the demonstration facilities as required. \n6  Site selection criteria will require that the reservoirs or tanks have (i) surface area of about 200 ha and mean depth of \nat least 1.5 meters; (ii) access through feeder roads; (iii) no obstacles to harvesting of fish (e.g., uncut tree trunks); (iv) \nsmooth bottom topography; (v) minimum susceptibility to flooding, as indicated in local records; (vi) not been used for \ndrinking water supply; (vii) favorable water quality parameters; (viii) poverty incidence among the local community; (ix) \nno social conflict related to fisheries and aquaculture among the local communities; and (x) around it, a CBO of \nsufficient level of development to ensure sustainability of fish production levels. In selecting sites for reservoirs or \ntanks, the Government will avoid all environmentally sensitive sites, including mangroves, ecologically important \nwetlands, and protected areas. Selection will be in coordination with relevant line agencies. ", "  5\nincluding women, and establish mechanisms to facilitate the delivery of project inputs; (ii) assist in \nestablishing formal CBOs where none exist, or in revitalizing and strengthening existing ones in \ncommunities around selected minor reservoirs and seasonal tanks; (iii) provide training to CBOs in \ntechnical and financial aspects of aquaculture; and (iv) provide training to CBOs in conflict resolution.7 \n \n17.  To ensure adequate supply of fish fingerlings to stock these tanks, the Project will upgrade \nthe capacity of existing government-run seed production centers and construct land- and water-\nbased  minihatcheries  for  management  by  CBOs.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  and/or  improve \nNAQDA\u2019s five aquaculture development centers (ADCs) and nine REOs.8 The facilities in the \nADCs  and  REOs  will  be  upgraded  for  use  in  fish-seed  production,  research,  training,  and \nextension. The civil works will include (i) rehabilitation and/or expansion of hatchery buildings, (ii) \nconstruction of additional spawning and broodstock development tanks, (iii) rehabilitation and/or \nconstruction  of  nursery  tanks,  (iv)  provision  of  water  supply  and  drainage  systems,  and  (v) \ninstallation of water treatment systems. Priority will be given to upgrading and rehabilitating existing \nbuildings.  Before  any  new  construction  undertaken,  upgrading  and  rehabilitating  must  be \ndemonstrated as not being a viable alternative. \n \n18.  To augment the supply of fish fry and fingerlings produced by ADCs and REOs, and to \npromote eventual transfer of seed production and sale from government to the private sector, at \nleast 25 minihatcheries will be constructed at sites with an anticipated high demand for fish \nfingerlings,  such  as  areas  close  to  perennial  or  seasonal  tanks.  Local  communities  will  be \nconsulted in identifying sites for hatcheries, and land-based hatcheries will be on government land \nthat is free of habitation, dispute, or controversy. In addition, at least 24 floating cage modules will \nbe installed in selected major reservoirs for rearing fish fry to fingerling size. Materials for land- and \nwater-based hatcheries will be procured with project funds, but construction will be carried out with \nlabor  contributed  by  CBOs.  Operating  expenses  will  be  borne  by  CBOs  through  the  sale  of \nfingerlings. NAQDA will levy a fee to cover the investment cost over a period of 5 years, after which \nCBOs will own the asset. REOs will provide hands-on training in hatchery management to CBO \nmembers entrusted to operate the hatcheries. This will eventually lead to hatcheries being owned \nand operated by CBOs, and NAQDA\u2019s role being one of regulation and certification. Transfer of \nhatchery ownership will be completed during the life of the Project. \n \n19.  Community-Based  Fisheries  Management.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  perennial  reservoir  fishery  is \nessentially a capture fishery, largely dependent on the natural reproduction of exotic tilapias. Thus, \nthere is no firm basis for implementing a fish-stocking program in the major and medium perennial \nreservoirs. In the absence of scientifically accepted and realistic yield-predictive models applicable \nto these reservoirs, increase in fish stocking (to achieve an increase in fish production from these \nreservoirs) is not recommended. Further, fish catches from these reservoirs are estimated to have \nalmost reached maximum sustainable yield levels. Therefore, the Project will introduce community-\nbased fisheries resource management in 50 selected major and medium perennial reservoirs \n(footnote 6); an added criterion for these reservoirs will be the existence and level of development \nof a CBO around the reservoir to ensure sustainability of production levels. This will be done \nthrough improvements in the (i) capacity of CBOs to undertake sustainable management of the \nresource; (ii) system of fisheries data collection and monitoring; (iii) current fisher, fishing boat, and \n                                                 \n7  NGOs will be selected based on detailed evaluation criteria, satisfactory to ADB, to be prepared at the start of the \nProject.  These criteria will include (i) geographic experience, (ii) work experience, (iii) technical and financial capacity, \n(iv) longevity, (v) recognition, (vi) gender orientation and experiences in applying participatory approaches, and (vii) \nethical practices. \n8  ADCs are located at Dambulla, Inginiyagala, Nuwara Eliya, Pambala, Rambodagalla, and Udawalawe. The REOs are \nlocated at Anuradhapura, Colombo, Galle, Gampaha, Kandy, Matara, Moneragala, Polonnaruwa, and Ratnapura. Two \nother REOs in Vavuniya and Batticaloa can be rehabilitated once the situation in the northeast permits. ", "6   \nfishing gear registration and licensing system; and (iv) support to self-regulation of fishing effort at \nthe local level. REOs and contracted NGOs will support local CBOs in implementing these activities. \n \n20.  Enterprise Development. NAQDA will establish, in partnership with the private sector, \naquaculture enterprises with potential for replication at other sites throughout the country. These \nmodel enterprises will demonstrate technical and commercial viability, and will include the following \ntypes of ventures: (i) carp culture in estate tanks, (ii) freshwater prawn hatchery and culture, (iii) red \ntilapia hatchery and growout facilities, (iv) milkfish hatchery and culture, (v) Artemia production in \nsalt  farms,  and  (vi)  ornamental  aquatic  plant  tissue  culture.9  All  private  sector  partners  and \ninvestors will be screened and selected based on criteria to be detailed at the start of project \nimplementation (footnote 5). The form and procedural details of the partnership will be developed \nin the first year of the Project, but will be based on leasing arrangements and management \ncontracts. NAQDA will recover the investment cost for the model enterprises through annualized \namortization  over  an  agreed  period,  at  the  end  of  which  the  ownership  of  the  asset  will  be \ntransferred to the private investors if it is on private land. \n \n21.  Applied Research. In support of private sector investment in aquaculture enterprises, \ncontinuing applied research will be conducted by NAQDA staff under the technical direction and \nguidance of consultants. Research activities will fall in two broad categories: (i) adaptive research \nand field verification trials on improved culture techniques for freshwater species, in which NGOs \nmay also be involved; and (ii) exploratory research on other species with potential for commercial \nproduction. As fish feed is critical to fish production (from broodstock to production of market-size \nfish), feed formulation using inexpensive local ingredients will be carried out at the Udawalawe \nADC, where a small prototype feedmill will be set up as a public-private partnership.10 This small-\nscale technology will be easily replicable by the private sector at low cost, to benefit small fishers. \nNAQDA\u2019s brackish water ADC will undertake research on new species with potential for mariculture, \nsupported by construction of a laboratory provided with appropriate equipment and facilities. \n \n2.  Fish Quality Improvement and Marketing \n22.  This component will include interventions aimed at (i) upgrading the quality of freshwater \nfish and other aquatic products, (ii) improving marketing and consumption of inland fish by rural \nand urban populations, and (iii) increasing export of inland fish and aquatic products. The two \nsubcomponents are described in the following paragraphs.  \n \n23.  Fish Quality Improvement. Model fish-drying/smoking units will be set up at three of the \nfish-receiving stations (para. 24) to be built by the Project at selected sites close to perennial and \nseasonal tanks. Each unit will consist of a small building with a cleaning and washing area, a \nprocessing area with a waste disposal system, storage areas for raw materials and processed \nproducts, and small working facilities and basic amenities. A model fish-filleting plant for red tilapia \nwill be established on government land (free of habitation, dispute or controversy) at a suitable \nlocation  between  Colombo  and  Mundalama  (Puttalam  district),  through  a  public-private \npartnership.  A  fish-health  management  laboratory  will  be  established  at  the  University  of \nPeradeniya Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, and a water quality and environmental monitoring \nlaboratory will be constructed at NAQDA\u2019s brackish water ADC at Pambala. \n \n                                                 \n9  During project preparation, various freshwater, brackish water, and marine species with potential for commercial \naquaculture were identified. A Supplementary Appendix presents the results of a prefeasibility analysis. \n10  Recent studies show the occurrence of a minor cyprinid (a family of soft-finned freshwater fish, including carp) in \nperennial reservoirs, that could be harvested and incorporated in fish feed as the protein source. ", "  7\n24.  Fish Marketing. The Project will facilitate establishment of a marketing and distribution \nnetwork for freshwater fish, from fish-receiving stations around the perennial and seasonal tanks to \nmodel freshwater fish-marketing facilities at Dambulla and Colombo. The Project will allow the \nexisting local marketing network to stabilize from the impact of project interventions, and poor \nfishers  to  strengthen  their  organizations  and  increase  their  outputs,  before  the  higher  level \ndistribution network is established. This phased approach will dovetail with the more detailed \nmarketing strategy to be developed under the Project.11 Modest fish-receiving stations will be \nconstructed at a minimum of 20 selected locations to provide basic facilities and amenities, and will \nbe served by upgraded feeder roads.12 A wholesale and retail fish market will be established at \nDambulla. This will serve as a central market outlet\u2014within an accessible distance from major \nwater bodies that have high production and one in close proximity to the main delivery routes. The \nmarket will have hygienic facilities for fish handling and distribution. In Colombo, a freshwater fish \nmarket will be built (on available government land), to specialize in high-quality, fresh and frozen \nfish,  as  well  as  value-added,  processed  freshwater  fish  products,  as  part  of  urban  market \ndevelopment.  It  will  be  a  medium-sized  outlet  with  modern  facilities,  display  equipment,  cold \nstorage, an ice machine, basic amenities, and refrigerated transport vans. The Dambulla and \nColombo markets will be established with an appropriate private sector partner, on land that is free \nof habitation, dispute or controversy. The investment cost will be recovered through leasing of \nstalls to fish traders, and the market will be operated, managed, and maintained by the private \nsector partner. The Project will identify interested fish traders, and provide credit and technical \nexpertise in the setting up of market stalls. \n \n25.  To  facilitate  the  development  of  an  efficient  islandwide  wholesale-retail  fish  market,  a \nmarket information system (MAIS) will be designed and installed at NAQDA. The MAIS will be \ndeveloped as a subsystem of the national inland fisheries and aquaculture information system \n(NIFAIS) to be set up at NAQDA (para. 31). The MAIS will contain information on (i) producer, \nwholesaler, and retailer prices of freshwater fish and other aquatic products; and (ii) prices, supply \nand demand in both domestic and international markets, technological innovations, and trade \nprofiles. The MAIS will evolve into a fee-based market intelligence service, which will include a \nmarket news service, a marketing extension service, and a market advisory service.  \n \n26.  To increase the consumption of freshwater fish, the Project will support design and launch \nof a multimedia information, education, and communication program. The program will target \nconsumers  outside  the  major  freshwater  fish-producing  areas.  A  local  marketing  and \ncommunications  company  will  be  contracted  to  carry  out  market  promotion  and  consumer \neducation activities under the guidance of an information, education, and communication specialist \nto be engaged under the Project. \n \n3.  Facilitating Access to Credit \n27.  Although several credit schemes are in operation, they have the following limitations: (i) \naquaculture and inland fisheries are given low priority or not covered at all, (ii) geographical \ncoverage does not extend to areas with aquaculture development potential, (iii) loan size is too \nsmall, and (iv) some credit programs will not be available for the duration of the Project. Therefore, \n                                                 \n11  The strategy will also draw upon market and demand analyses being prepared under TA:ADB. 2000. Technical \nAssistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Fish Supply and Demand in Asia\u2014Prospects for \nPoor Households. Manila. \n12  NAQDA will ensure that, for these fish receiving stations (i) the relevant CBOs or NGOs are consulted in their siting, (ii) \nthey are operated and maintained by the local communities or CBOs, (iii) guidelines are developed for their operation \nand maintenance, and (iv) commissions on sales are collected and contributed to a market development fund to cover \nthe cost of operating and maintaining them. ", "8   \nthe Project includes a credit component estimated at SLRs600 million ($6.2 million), comprising \nmicrocredit  for  community  investments  (about  SLRs137  million)  and  credit  for  commercial \ninvestments for fisheries and aquaculture enterprises (about SLRs463 million). The former will be \nnoncollateralized, group-based lending, while the latter will be on commercial terms and conditions. \n \n28.  Microcredit will be implemented by the National Development Trust Fund (NDTF) on behalf \nof the Government. NDTF has a track record of over 10 years in microfinance, through a revolving \nfund originally funded by the World Bank, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, and the Government. As \nNDTF has adequate resources, it will be a project cofinancier. It lends to partner organizations at \n7% per annum, which in turn lend to clients for viable projects at a spread of around 12%. This \nmakes the cost of funds market-based, without subsidy, and ensures the optimal use of economic \nresources in projects undertaken. Prior to any lending of NDTF proceeds to participating partner \norganizations,  NDTF  will  enter  into  a  loan  agreement  with  each  partner  organizations.  The \nmaximum loan amount will be SLRs60,000 per subborrower and the term of loans is a maximum of \n36 months with up to a 6-month grace period. The Project will assist NDTF with capacity building, \nincluding  training  participating  partner  organizations,  and  facilitate  small  fishers\u2019  access  to \nmicrocredit through group formation and community organization. \n \n29.  Credit to fisheries and aquaculture enterprises will be financed under the Project to support \nestablishment of enterprises to replicate demonstration models. Consistent with the approach \nfollowed by other projects, the credit will be routed through an apex bank to eligible commercial \nand development banks\u2014referred to as participating financial institutions (PFIs)\u2014and the average \nweighted deposit rate will be the anchor for relending. The rate is determined monthly (10.2% \nduring appraisal in May 2002) by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and captures an element of \nmedium-term interest rates. It is considered an appropriate benchmark. The National Development \nBank (NDB) will serve as the apex bank, responsible for coordinating and monitoring the credit \nscheme and the administrative functions associated with refinance applications and loan disbursement \nrequests by the PFIs. NDB will enter into a participation agreement with each PFI, prior to any \nrelending.13 The PFIs will onlend to individual borrowers at a spread not exceeding 7%, which provides \nfor PFI administration costs, loan loss provisioning, apex bank fee (not more than 1%), and profit.  \n \n4.  Institutional Strengthening Component \n30.  This component will comprise interventions aimed at enhancing the institutional capability of \nNAQDA  and  other  sector  institutions,  including  CBOs,  in  inland  fisheries  and  aquaculture \ndevelopment. The institutional strengthening of NAQDA will involve the following activities: (i) \nhuman resource development, including training on gender awareness, poverty orientation, and \nparticipatory approaches; (ii) physical facility upgrading and equipment provision; (iii) establishment \nof the NIFAIS; and (iv) support for legal and policy work. The Project will provide for the design and \nimplementation  of  a  human  resource  development  and  training  program  to  equip  NAQDA \npersonnel with technical, financial, and management skills that will enable NAQDA to achieve its \ngoals and make the best use of its resources. NAQDA\u2019s extension service will receive priority \nattention in the human resource development program in view of its critical role in the attainment of \n                                                 \n13  To be eligible, a PFI shall (i) be formally incorporated under the Companies Act or specific Act of Parliament; (ii) have \naudit reports without material qualification by auditors for each of the 5 preceding years; (iii) be in compliance with \nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) guidelines and Basle guidelines on financial soundness including capital adequacy \nand liquidity, profitability, solvency, return on average assets, debt service coverage ratio and long-term debt to equity \nratio, and including CBSL limits set for single borrower and loans to PFIs\u2019 directors, officers and related interests; (iv) \nhave agreed to provide quarterly information on project implementation in a standardized format; (v) have assigned a \nsenior staff member for coordination and overall monitoring of subloan operations; (vi) show improved loan collection \nratios each year; (vii) have not defaulted on any loan or refinancing granted by the Government or CBSL; (viii) have \nbeen formally approved by CBSL; and (ix) have entered into a participation agreement with NDB satisfactory to ADB. ", "  9\nthe Project\u2019s objectives. In addition, the physical facilities at the ADCs and REOs will be renovated \nand/or upgraded, and a modest field training center will be constructed on government land near \nthe Kalawewa Reservoir in Anuradhapura. These centers will be provided with training, extension \nand research equipment and library facilities for use by field technical and extension personnel.  \n \n31.  A  computerized  NIFIAS  will  be  designed  and  installed  at  NAQDA  headquarters.  The \nNIFAIS will consist of database subsystems on catch and effort, biological and environmental \nparameters,  socioeconomic  and  institutional  profiles,  and  trade  and  markets.  Geographic \ninformation system applications will also be introduced as part of the NIFAIS. The database \nmanagement system will be Internet-based and linked to other existing local and international \ndatabases required for in inland fisheries and aquaculture development and management.  \n \n32.  Under the act establishing NAQDA (NAQDA Act 1998, as amended), NAQDA is permitted \nto engage in developing the aquaculture industry, but responsibility for management of aquaculture \nand inland fisheries remains vested with the Department of Fisheries in the Ministry of Fisheries \nand Ocean Resources (MFOR), as relevant provisions in the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act \n1966 (Fisheries Act), were not repealed. Amendment of the NAQDA Act is needed to (i) provide \npowers to NAQDA to regulate subsector activities with a view to resource management; (ii) rationalize \nprovisions relating to the NAQDA board, including reducing its size, prescribing qualifications for \nappointees, and adopting the Government\u2019s accepted corporate governance practices; and (iii) \nrationalize provisions relating to commercial functions and powers, to eliminate the scope for conflict \nof interest with its regulatory role. The Project will support implementation of these changes.14 \n \n33.  The Project will strengthen other sector institutions through various short-term training \nprograms, workshops and seminars, observation and study tours, and domestic and international \ntraining fellowships for short courses and formal degree courses. Besides providing for extensive \ntraining of small-scale fishers and their societies, the Project will organize training of trainers for \ncontracted NGOs, CBOs, and partner organizations, and extension personnel of other Government \nagencies involved in the sector, particularly the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka and the Agrarian \nServices Department. NAQDA will provide training to NAQDA staff, particularly at ADCs and \nREOs, and elected members of participating institutions and CBOs on sound financial management \nand resource utilization, enterprise development, business promotion and marketing, public relations \nand information management, gender awareness, and dispute resolution and mediation (building \non existing processes at the community level for dispute resolution). National professional and \neducation institutions will be involved in this process. The private sector will be given the opportunity \nto participate in project-organized training courses and study tours on a cost-sharing basis.  \n \n5.  Project Management \n34.  This component will support timely and effective implementation of the Project, as well as \ncost-effective utilization of funds and other project resources. It will include (i) establishing a project \nmanagement office (PMO); (ii) providing project management specialist support; (iii) engaging \nNGOs and other service providers; (iv) procuring equipment, vehicles, and supplies and materials; \nand (v) setting up accounting, monitoring, and reporting systems.  \n \n                                                 \n14  Under the project preparatory TA (footnote 1), additional support is being provided to NAQDA to prepare the \nnecessary legal documentation for submission to Parliament, to synchronize with amendments to the Fisheries Act \nbeing prepared under Coastal Resource Management Project: ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \nCoastal Resource Management Project. Manila. These amendments will primarily include review and revision of \nsections 3, 5, 11, 12, and 37 of the existing Act. ", "10   \nC.  Special Features \n35.  The Project takes a holistic approach to developing the subsector, and will facilitate the \nprivate sector (formal and informal) taking a lead in new investments. The focus of the Project is to \ndevelop  and  demonstrate  models  that  can  be  easily  replicated  by  CBOs  and  by  private \nentrepreneurs. With this in view, the project design centers on developing small-scale, low-cost \ninfrastructure at the community level, and supporting entrepreneurship development by providing \naccess  to  (i)  technology,  (ii)  technical  expertise,  (iii)  information  systems,  (iv)  credit,  and  (v) \nextension services. Through institutional strengthening activities, the Project will assist NAQDA to \nbuild  its  technical  and  financial  capacity  to  support  these  developments,  and  to  become  a \nfinancially self-sustaining organization. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n36.  The total project cost (including interest during implementation, taxes, and physical and \nprice  contingencies)  is  estimated  at  $30.0  million  equivalent,  comprising  a  foreign  exchange \ncomponent  of  $8.6  million  (28.6%  of  total  cost)  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  $21.4  million \nequivalent. Cost estimates are summarized in Table 1, and are detailed in Appendix 4. \n \nTable 1:  Cost Estimates  \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Financing Plan \n37.  The Government has requested two ADB loans to finance 67% of the cost (100% of the \nforeign exchange cost and 53% of the local currency cost). A loan not exceeding the equivalent of \n$13.8 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will have a maturity of 32 years including a \ngrace period of 8 years, a service charge of 1.0% during the grace period, and an interest charge \nof 1.5% per annum during the amortization period. A loan of \u00a5726.4 million ($6.2 million) from ", "  11\nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, to finance the credit component of the Project, will have a 25-\nyear term including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum; a front-end fee of \n1.0%  (the  fee  will  be  capitalized  in  the  loan);  conversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in \naccordance  with  the  terms  of  the  draft  Loan  Agreement,  the  Loan  Regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s \nConversion Guidelines; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. CBOs and private sector investors will finance about $0.7 \nmillion and $1.2 million, respectively. NDTF will finance microcredit requirements of the Project, \nand will provide about $1.6 million for this purpose. The remaining $6.5 million equivalent will be \nfinanced by the Government.

The level of local cost financing proposed takes into account the current macroeconomic \nsituation, and the Government\u2019s inability to finance a substantial share of the investment program \nrequired to enable the country to achieve its development goals. After achieving 6% growth in \ngross domestic product in 2000, Sri Lanka faced negative economic growth in 2001, with production \ndeclining by 1%. The Government has reiterated its commitment to reforms to improve macroeconomic \nconditions, and has targeted the fiscal deficit to decline to 5% in 2005. Despite these efforts, the \nGovernment\u2019s  capacity  to  self-finance  the  public  investment  program  in  the  medium  term  is \nexpected to be limited. Therefore, continued ADB support for local cost financing is justified in view \nof the need for sizeable investment to successfully reduce poverty and achieve higher growth. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management and Organization \n39.  The proposed project organization structure is shown in Appendix 5. It is designed to \nensure  efficiency  and  control  within  the  Project,  while  fostering  and  maintaining  clear \ncommunications and effective cooperation with various entities involved in project implementation, \nincluding private sector partners, NGOs, and CBOs. The MFOR will be the Executing Agency for \nthe Project and the secretary, MFOR, will be primarily responsible for the Project in the capacity of \nchief accounting officer. MFOR has extensive experience as executing agency for similar ADB \nloan-funded projects, including the recently completed Fisheries Sector Project and the ongoing ", "12   \nCoastal Resource Management Project.15 NAQDA will be the lead implementing agency. NAQDA \nwas created in 1998 specifically to lead the development of inland fisheries and aquaculture. Its \ncapacity will be built under the Project through the institutional strengthening component and by its \nassuming  the  lead  role  in  project  implementation.  NAQDA  will  be  directly  responsible  for \nimplementing  some  activities,  while  facilitating  implementation  of  others.  Other  agencies \nresponsible for implementing project activities include (i) NDTF, as cofinancier for the microcredit \nsubcomponent; (ii) NDB as apex bank for the credit subcomponent for small and medium enterprises; \n(iii) private sector partners who will work jointly with NAQDA to establish inland fisheries and \naquaculture enterprises; and (iv) the University of Peradeniya, which will implement the fish health \nlaboratory. Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka and Agrarian Services Department will participate in \ntraining activities, especially for their field workers concerned with fisheries-related extension work. \n \n40.  A  working  group  comprising  representatives  of  relevant  industry  associations,  private \ncompanies, relevant NGOs and CBOs, NDB, and MFOR will play an active role in day-to-day \nproject implementation. The working group will ensure that all components of the Project receive \nappropriate emphasis during implementation. Specifically, the group will (i) approve criteria for \nselection of sites, NGO and CBO partners, and private sector and industry partners; (ii) finalize \nselection  of  sites  and  partners;  (iii)  advise  on  the  form  and  mechanics  of  implementing \npartnerships; (iv) regularly review implementation progress of these partnerships; (v) facilitate \naccess to credit by selected partners; (vi) approve the annual work program of the Project; and (vii) \nendorse project progress reports. The group will be chaired by the chairperson, NAQDA. Its \nmembers will be selected by NAQDA with the concurrence of secretary, MFOR. \n \n41.  A PMO will be established and function under the leadership of a project director. The \nproject director will be appointed in accordance with the Government\u2019s procedures16 and will report \nto  the  chairperson  of  NAQDA  and,  through  the  chairperson,  to  the  working  group  and  the \nsecretary,  MFOR.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  administering,  implementing,  monitoring, \nreporting, and coordinating all project activities. The PMO will also facilitate the proceedings of the \nworking group and serve as the liaison between the Government and ADB. The PMO staff will \ninclude an adequate number of field officers who will operate on a semipermanent basis in out-\nstation areas to facilitate implementation of all project activities. They will be the operational front of \nthe PMO for many project interventions. When appropriate, these officers will operate out of, and in \nclose coordination with NAQDA ADCs. \n \n42.  An interagency project steering committee will be established to guide overall direction of \nthe Project and ensure overall coordination of activities between the Project and other Government \nprograms and projects. The project steering committee will be chaired by the secretary, MFOR, \nand include the chairperson, NAQDA, as member-convener and the project director as member-\nsecretary. Other members will be representatives of the (i) External Resources Department; (ii) \nNational Planning Department; (iii) Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources; (iv) Ministry of \nMahaweli Development; (v) Agrarian Services Department; (vi) National Water Resources Council; \n(vii) National Budget Department; (viii) Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Peradeniya; \n(ix) NDTF; and (x) NDB. The Committee will follow up on policy and legislative work, resolve any \ninteragency problems, formulate solutions to impediments to project implementation, and provide \n                                                 \n15  ADB. 1992.

", "  13\npolicy guidance as needed. It will also coordinate with participating agencies at the national level. It \nwill meet at least quarterly in the first 2 years of project implementation, and semiannually thereafter. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n43.  The Project will be implemented over 7 years (2003\u20132009). The first year will be spent \nmainly in setting up the PMO, and other preparatory tasks, including (i) preparing work and \nfinancial plans; (ii) finalizing selection criteria, and selecting sites; (iii) procuring goods and services \n(consultants, NGOs, and other service contractors); (iv) designing and installing a computerized \nmanagement information system, including a project performance management system (PPMS); \nand  (v)  finalizing  the  form  of  public-private  partnerships,  and  selecting  partners  according  to \napproved criteria. After the NGOs are contracted by the PMO, social preparation and community \norganizing work will commence, and be followed by enterprise planning, and training and skills \ndevelopment  among  organized  groups.  Infrastructure  development  will  start  after  satisfactory \ncompletion of social preparation, as well as completion of engineering plans and designs, and \nselection of civil works contractors. Production and marketing activities, as well as support services \nsuch as training, extension, and credit provision, will commence once the physical facilities are \nready and will continue until project completion. Six months will be allotted for project completion \nactivities. A project implementation schedule is in Appendix 6. ADB has approved advance action \nfor recruitment of consultants and procurement of civil works. Approval of advance action does not \ncommit ADB to subsequently approve the Project or to finance procurement costs. \n \n3.  Procurement \n44.  The PMO will be responsible for procurement of all goods and services under the Project. \nProcurement of goods and related services and civil works will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. All goods to be purchased through local competitive bidding \nwill be procured in accordance with Government procedures acceptable to ADB. ADB-financed \ncivil works contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of $1.0 million and above will be awarded on \nthe basis of international competitive bidding, while contracts of less than $1.0 million will be \ncarried out by prequalified contractors selected under the Government\u2019s procedures satisfactory to \nADB. Award of contracts with a value equivalent to $500,000 and above will need prior ADB \napproval. Supply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of more than $500,000 will be awarded \non the basis of international competitive bidding and $500,000 or less will be awarded on the basis \nof international shopping. Minor items costing less than $100,000 equivalent may be procured \nthrough direct purchase. Indicative contract packages are given in Appendix 7. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n45.  Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. \nThe quality and cost-based selection method will be used. A team of consultants will be engaged, \nthrough a firm, by MFOR to support the PMO in project management, and to provide technical \nadvice and assistance in implementing specific interventions. The consulting services requirement is \nestimated at a total of 197 person-months, comprising 51 international and 146 domestic person-\nmonths. Details are in Appendix 8, which also includes outline terms of reference for the consulting \nservices. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n46.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook. To ensure timely release of the loan proceeds and counterpart funds, and expedite ", "14   \nproject  implementation,  the  Government  will,  immediately  after  the  loan  becomes  effective, \nestablish two imprest accounts in the CBSL, one for the credit component (to be operated by NDB) \nand one for all other components of the Project (to be operated by the PMO). The imprest \naccounts  will  be  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. The initial amount to be deposited in each imprest account will be \n$300,000. The statement of expenditure procedure will be used to replenish and liquidate the \nimprest account operated by the PMO, and to reimburse eligible expenditures up to a maximum of \n$100,000 per individual payment. The imprest account may not be used to liquidate expenditures \nrelated to NAQDA facilities. Procedures need to be established to expedite the processing of small \ncontracts for the many initiatives at the local level. Disbursements to NDB and from NDB to the \nPFIs will be made on a reimbursement basis in accordance with the subsidiary agreement to be \nentered into by NDB with each PFI. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n47.  All agencies involved in project implementation will prepare and maintain separate accounts \nfor  project-related  disbursements.  The  PMO  will  consolidate  the  accounts  from  various \nimplementing agencies and submit them to MFOR, which will review the consolidated accounts, \nand after auditing, submit them to the Ministry of Finance and ADB. The audit of imprest accounts \nand statements of expenditure can be carried out as part of the regular annual audit. The auditor\u2019s \nopinion  of  that  part  of  the  examination  relating  to  the  imprest  accounts  and  statements  of \nexpenditure should be separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report. Project accounts, together with \ndisbursement documents, will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB, and \nwill be submitted to ADB within 9 months of the end of each fiscal year. The Government and PMO \nwill ensure submission of audited project accounts within this stipulated time frame. \n \n48.  The PMO will furnish quarterly progress reports to ADB on project implementation, to be \nsubmitted within 1 month of the end of the quarter to which they relate, and such other reports and \ninformation relating to the Project as ADB may reasonably request. Within 3 months of physical \ncompletion of the Project, the PMO will submit a project completion report to the project steering \ncommittee and ADB. The project director will be responsible for preparing these reports, accounts, \nand statements, and ensuring that they are submitted in accordance with the agreed time frame.  \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n49.  At the start of project implementation, a PPMS will be established as part of a computerized \nmanagement information system at the PMO. The PPMS will emphasize project outputs and \nimpact evaluation. With the active participation of PMO staff, consultants to be engaged under the \nProject will design and undertake a baseline survey. The survey will be repeated at midterm and at \nproject completion, to provide information needed to evaluate financial, economic, and social \nimpacts of the Project. At the CBO level, participatory monitoring and evaluation will be introduced \nas part of the Project\u2019s comprehensive participatory development approach. Special studies may \nbe conducted as required to investigate issues relating to project implementation and its impacts. \nFor periodic monitoring, key indicators will be developed and incorporated in the regular reporting \nsystem. PMO staff will regularly visit field sites to monitor progress. \n \n8.  Project Review \n50.  In the fourth year, a comprehensive midterm review of the Project will be carried out to \nidentify any problems and constraints encountered, and to suggest measures to address identified \nconstraints. Technical or budgetary changes to the project document, requested or arising from the \nPPMS results, will also be considered, as in the inclusion of additional activities at any of the field ", "  15\nsites or the consideration of possible expansion of activities or sites over the remaining project \nperiod. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits \n51.  Based on the economic benefit and cost streams derived from the financial analysis of \nrepresentative  enterprises  (details  in  Supplementary  Appendix),  the  economic  internal  rate  of \nreturn for the Project as a whole was estimated at about 16% (a Supplementary Appendix). Annual \nquantifiable benefits expected on project completion, include (i) increased production of freshwater \nfish and prawns: incremental production of 26,000 t of carp and tilapia, and 864 t of freshwater \nprawns; (ii) enhanced productive capacity of about 10,000 ha of perennial minor reservoirs, and \nabout 3,000 ha of selected seasonal tanks and improved fisheries management in about 50 major \nperennial reservoirs with a total surface area of about 97,000 ha: incremental fish production of \nabout 10,000 t; (iii) increased pond production area: 250 ha for carp, 600 ha for red tilapia, and 250 \nha  for  freshwater  prawn;  (iv)  increased  private  sector  investment  in  aquaculture:  420  new \nminihatcheries and nurseries for carp and tilapia, 26 hatcheries and 250 ha of ponds for freshwater \nprawns, 90 ornamental fish nurseries, and 25 ornamental aquatic plant nurseries; (v) increased \nvolume  of  marketed  fish  products:  13,000  t  of  fresh  fish  sold  through  new  market  facilities, \nincremental ornamental fish exports of about 6 million pieces, and about 18 million ornamental \naquatic plants; (vi) increased employment: about 10,850 person-years of employment, mostly in \ninland rural areas, of which more than 50% will be generated in communities close to the tanks \nwhere over 30% of the population is poor; and (vii) increased Government tax revenue: about \nSLRs111 million ($1.2 million).  \n \n52.  In addition to these quantifiable benefits, the Project is expected to produce the following \nnonquantifiable benefits: (i) increased food supply, and improved nutrition and health of rural \npopulations; (ii) improved fisheries management in large and medium perennial reservoirs; (iii) a \nstrengthened and self-sustaining NAQDA with the institutional capacity to play its mandated role in \naquaculture development; (iv) enhanced interagency and public-private sector linkages through \nstrengthened partnerships in inland fisheries and aquaculture development; (v) small fishers and \nrural communities empowered with knowledge and skills for community-based fisheries management; \nand (vi) CBOs with acquired entrepreneurial and management skills in inland fisheries-related \nenterprises.  \n \nB.  Social Measures and Impact on Poverty \n53.  Population in the Project Area. The total population in the nine districts of the project area \nis 6.1 million in 1.5 million households with an average household size of 4.4. The proportion of \nfemales (51.9%) living in the project area is slightly higher than that of males (48.1%). The \npopulation consists of about 82.9% Sinhalese, 12.3% Tamils, 3.8% Muslims, and less than 1% \nother  groups.  Surveys  conducted  during  project  preparation  estimate  that  about  33%  of  the \npopulation in the project area live below the poverty line. \n \n54.  Lack of Access to Services. Some 22% of households in the project area do not have \nlatrines and only 58% have access to safe drinking water. About 30% of households are connected \nto electricity. Extension, health, and other services are limited. However, the nine districts have \nsufficient schools and an adequate number of teachers. As small perennial and seasonal tanks are \nlocated in remote and sparsely populated areas, the incidence of poverty is higher here than \naround larger perennial tanks. The Project will define social selection criteria and adopt a phased \napproach, ensuring that small perennial and seasonal tanks are prioritized in project interventions. ", "16   \nThe  Project  will  also  improve  the  mobility  of  extension  staff,  enabling  them  to  reach  these \ndisadvantaged areas. \n \n55.  Social Stratification. A small group of poorest of the poor (about 1% of households \ntargeted) gets its income from marginal employment as casual laborers, seasonal employment as \nfarm workers, and subsidies from the Government. To supplement their diet, these people are \nforced to engage in illegal fishing. The Project will attempt to reach this group through targeted \ninterventions, particularly provision of training in skills needed in fisheries (e.g., net mending) and \nby supporting the use of their newly acquired skills. Specifically, alternative income opportunities \nwill prevent illegal fishing by this group. The groups living below and just above the poverty line \n(about 53% of the target population) consist of full-time and part-time fisherfolk, bicycle vendors, \nand small-scale animal husbandry operators. A large number of respondents from these groups \nexpressed the need for more job opportunities. They will be provided access to (i) extension \nservices, (ii) sources of fish seed and fish culture information, (iii) credit, and (iv) training on fish \nproduction and improved fish handling. Existing CBOs will be strengthened using participatory \napproaches, starting with gender-sensitive participatory assessments of organizational capacities. \nAround seasonal and minor tanks, new groups will be organized by NGOs. All training will be \nhands-on, participatory, and adapted to the needs of the respective target group (Appendix 9). \n \n56.  Social Conflicts. Social conflicts have evolved, in particular, around some larger perennial \ntanks in the south, mainly between the more affluent truck-owning fish vendors and organized \nfisherfolk. Ethnicity does not play a role in these conflicts. The project scope will not include tanks \nwhere such conflicts exist, until the conflicts have been resolved to the satisfaction of the PMO and \nthe parties involved. The Project will facilitate resolution of conflicts by providing mediation and \nnegotiation assistance in such cases, building on existing systems for dispute resolution. More \nconflicts may arise as a result of increased utilization of seasonal and minor perennial tanks for \nculture-based fisheries. Conflict management training will be provided to CBOs, extension staff, \nand NGOs, enabling them to handle such problems at the local level. To minimize conflicts arising \nin  the  future,  a  thorough  situation  analysis  will  be  carried  out,  and  implications  of  planned \ninterventions will be discussed with the target group population. \n \n57.  Gender.  At  present  women  are  rarely  involved  in  aquaculture-related  activities  in  the \nproject  area.  Consequently  their  participation  in  fishers\u2019  associations  is  low.  But  they  have \nexpressed great interest in increasing their involvement. The Project will encourage women\u2019s \nparticipation and provide opportunities for them to play active roles in setting up, operating, and \nmanaging small-scale culture-based fishery enterprises. The formation and strengthening of fishers\u2019 \nassociations will ensure equitable opportunities for (i) membership and representation of women, \nand (ii) assuming leadership functions in these associations.  \n \n58.  NAQDA and other implementing agencies will take steps to ensure that women living in the \nproject area participate fully in planning and implementing project activities. The PMO will give \npriority to women (i) for training, and (ii) under the microcredit subcomponent. Training courses will \nbe  scheduled  with  special  consideration  to  women\u2019s  availability.  These  courses  will  include \nentrepreneurial skills development, inland fishery and aquaculture production and management \ntechniques, simple record and bookkeeping, credit and debt service management, and leadership. \n \n59.  Gender awareness training will be provided to NAQDA staff at all levels. A proven track \nrecord on gender inclusion in project activities will become a selection criterion for NGOs. NAQDA \nwill fill its vacant positions by giving hiring preference to women. One PMO staff member will be \ndesignated as the gender focal point responsible for organizing such training, coordinating gender-\nrelated activities, advising on how gender concerns can be incorporated into project activities, and \nmonitoring the extent to which this is done. Gender-disaggregated data will be collected through ", "  17\nthe baseline PPMS survey, as well as subsequent surveys to be conducted at midterm and \ncompletion. Gender indicators will be included in the PPMS and will become an important element \nin the evaluation system for the PMO and NGOs. \n \n60.  Impact on Poverty. Poverty reduction in rural areas of Sri Lanka requires increasing \nincome  by  providing  employment  opportunities  and  improving  consumption.  It  also  means \nstabilizing the economic basis of those living marginally above the poverty line and vulnerable to \nseasonal unemployment or food shortages. Training of CBOs on better resource management will \nimprove  productive  capacities  of  rural  communities,  and  transform  fishing  communities  into \nresponsible  resource  managers  and  users.  Illegal  fishers  will  be  provided  alternative  income \nthrough specific fishery-related skills training, which will help prevent illegal fishing. Increased food \nsupply together with higher income will improve nutrition and health, as will improved processing \nfacilities using hygienic and sanitary fish-handling practices. As women will be specifically involved \nin these activities, the improvements will have a direct impact on their families and living conditions. \nTargeting of specific subgroups of the population will provide employment opportunities in rural \nareas where these are scarce, and allow these poorer groups to secure an income and establish \nthemselves  as  satisfied  members  of  the  communities.  Strengthening  of  CBOs  following  a \nparticipatory approach will improve their access to services and make them self-reliant and more \nself-confident. The number of households below the poverty line is expected to decline by 10 \npercentage points as a result of project interventions. \n \nC.  Environment \n61.  An initial environmental examination conducted during project preparation (a summary is in \nAppendix 10) showed that only a few minor environmental impacts are likely as a result of (i) \nintroducing  culture-based  fisheries  in  seasonal  tanks,  (ii)  constructing  water-  and  land-based \nminihatcheries, (iii) undertaking civil works renovate ADCs, (iv) constructing various production and \nmarketing facilities, and (v) using abandoned brackish water ponds for red tilapia and milkfish \nculture. The potential impacts are small and avoidable, and can be mitigated by other project \ninterventions included in the project costs. None of the proposed interventions is environmentally \ncritical or anticipated to create significant adverse or negative impacts on the environment. Instead, \nthe Project is likely to bring about benefits in the form of enhanced fisheries management in major \nand medium perennial reservoirs, optimized utilization of the productivity of seasonal tanks, improved \nenvironmental sanitation at fish-landing sites, improved quality of fish for human consumption, and \ngreater public awareness of the need for resource management and environmental protection.  \n \n62.  Nevertheless,  environmental  conditions  at  project  sites  will  be  monitored  regularly  to \ndetermine changes in levels of essential parameters\u2014mainly those pertaining to water quality\u2014to \nprevent fish mortality or disease conditions. ADCs will be equipped with a basic chemistry and \nwater quality laboratory where samples can be brought from the field for testing. Portable water \ntest kits will also be procured to enable NAQDA field personnel to conduct on-site water quality \nmonitoring. Environmental considerations have been included in selection criteria (footnote 6) for \nspecific sites for establishing various production and marketing facilities, to ensure that none of \nthese  facilities  is  set  up  in  environmentally  critical  or  protected  areas.  Construction  of  water \ntreatment  facilities  and  settling/sedimentation  ponds/tanks  in  brackish  water  ponds  will  be  a \nprerequisite for issuing permits or licenses to private fish farmers, to minimize the risk of water \nquality deterioration in receiving waters. NAQDA, through the PMO, will play an important role in \nenvironmental  monitoring  and  management  by  coordinating  the  activities  of  its  technical  and \nextension personnel involved in field-level monitoring. \n ", "18   \nD.  Risks \n63.  To minimize risks involved in implementation, project design incorporates strengthening \nrelated legislation and institutions, within the Government\u2019s policy of catalyzing private sector \ninvestment in the subsector, and the Government\u2019s accepted practices for corporate governance. \nRisks associated with the projected increases in production, product marketability and pricing, and \ntheir anticipated impacts on fish consumption and affordability were considered during project \npreparation. Current annual production from inland fisheries and aquaculture is still below the peak \nproduction achieved in 1990. Keeping in view decadal population growth as well as potential for an \nincrease in per capita consumption, production increases are expected to be absorbed by the \ndomestic markets. Tilapia is consumed mainly by poor consumers because of its relatively low \nprice compared with other fish species. Prices of tilapia have remained stable even with increasing  \ndemand in urban markets, and the risk of prices becoming unaffordable with planned increases in \nproduction is unlikely. Project design provides for more detailed market surveys and strategies to \nbe conducted, and a market information system to be established to support marketing of projected \nsurplus production by the private sector. Participatory approaches and social preparation activities \nincorporated in project design will mitigate risks of inappropriate production, and result in expected \nbenefits and impacts exceeding the costs. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n64.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  NAQDA will enter into agreements with the relevant CBOs for (a) the operation and \nmanagement of the land-based and water-based hatcheries to be constructed under \nthe Project, and (b) the repayment of the investment cost for the relevant hatchery \nover a period of not more than 5 years. \n(ii)  NAQDA will ensure that the major and medium-sized perennial reservoirs to be \nincluded in the Project are selected in accordance with the criteria agreed with the \nBorrower and ADB. \n(iii)  NAQDA, with the approval of MFOR, will select the private sector participants and \nsubrojects, to participate in or be included in the Project, in accordance with criteria \napproved by the working group and agreed with the Borrower and ADB. \n(iv)  The Borrower will ensure that the University of Peradeniya provides (a) the land \nrequired for the construction of the fish-health management laboratory facility, and \n(b)  training  courses  and  workshops  related  to  the  laboratory  facilities  to  be \nestablished under the Project. \n(v)  The  Borrower  will  ensure  that  NAQDA  provides  the  land  and  facilities  at  the \nPambala ADC required to establish the brackish water aquaculture laboratory to \nprovide fee-based services to private sector fish farmers. \n(vi)  The Borrower, NAQDA, and NDTF will ensure that each partner organization meets \neligibility criteria satisfactory to ADB and that each subproject under the community-\nbased fisheries management component will meet eligibility requirements satisfactory \nto ADB, including as set out in the participation agreement. \n(vii)  The agreements will set out the terms and conditions for lending from NDTF to each \npartner organization, including detailed operating instructions for relending from partner \norganizations to subborrowers. Relending terms will be as follows: (a) The partner \norganization's relending interest rate will not exceed 19% per annum, and the first ", "  19\nsubloan to a subborrower will not exceed SLRs30,000. The maximum amount for a \nsubsequent loan will not exceed SLRs60,000, in each case pursuant to a loan \nagreement. (b) The tenor of the subloans will be for a minimum of 6 months, and a \nmaximum of 30 months with a grace period of up to 6 months. \n(viii)  The Borrower will ensure that NDB implements the credit scheme for small and \nmedium enterprises as described in the ADB Loan Agreement and performs all \nobligations under the subsidiary loan agreement. \n(ix)  The Borrower and NDB will ensure that each PFI meets eligibility criteria satisfactory \nto ADB and that each subproject under the enterprise development subcomponent \nwill meet eligibility requirements satisfactory to ADB, including as set out in the \nsubsidiary loan agreement. The minimum subloan will be SLRs100,000, and the \nmaximum maturity will be 5 years. All credit risks will be borne by the PFIs and the \ncollateral, if required for lending, will be determined by the PFIs. \n(x)  Within 12 months of loan effectiveness, the CBSL will establish a revolving fund \nunder  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB,  which  will  be  credited  to  the  interest \npayments and principal repayments by PFIs under the Project. The resources of the \nrevolving fund will be utilized for onlending to eligible subprojects only upon project \nclosing.  Funds  that  are  not  immediately  required  to  provide  refinancing  will  be \ninvested by NDB in securities approved by the Borrower to augment the resources \nof the revolving fund. The life of the revolving fund will be not more than 15 years. \n(xi)  Within 1 month of loan effectiveness, NAQDA will have completed preparation of the \n(a) draft Cabinet memorandum for the amendments to the NAQDA Act, as agreed \nwith the Borrower, MFOR, and ADB; (b) draft of the proposed amendments; and (c) \ndraft regulations under the proposed amended NAQDA Act; and submitted items (b) \nand (c) to ADB for its review.

Market Structure. The main participants in the market for freshwater fish are producers, \ntraders, and consumers who are directly linked with the system. Large processors are not \nimportant players at present due to the lack of marketable surpluses at the local markets, i.e., \nwithin a 10 kilometer (km) radius from the production sites. Any curing or drying of unsold stocks \nis  done  by  the  producers  themselves.  Indirect  participants  are  those  who  provide  support \nservices, such as transporters\u2014mostly small vendors who carry the fish short distances to local \nconsumers. \n \n2.  Fishers are the first link of the marketing chain as they catch fish and make these \navailable for sale. They are generally small-scale producers who live adjacent to seasonal tanks \nand perennial reservoirs, have low levels of education, and live in very poor conditions. Fishing \nis their major income-generating activity, although supplementary sources such as farming and \nwage labor activities are also undertaken, depending on location. Trading of inland fish is \ngenerally undertaken by bicycle and motorcycle vendors, who sell fish door-to-door along their \nregular routes. Bicycle traders, with a daily trading volume of about 50 kilogram (kg), sell fish to \ncustomers within a 10 km radius, while motorcycle vendors, who on the average trade 75\u2013100 \nkg a day, cover about 30 km. Trading largely takes place before noon. The limited trading time \nfor freshwater fish is attributed to any or a combination of the following: (i) limited marketable \nsurplus, (ii) poor or inadequate cold storage facilities (mainly ice boxes) of traders, and (iii) \nlimited trading capacity of traders. At present, consumption of inland or freshwater fish occurs \nmainly around tanks and reservoirs where the fish is readily available. Inland fish, such as tilapia \nwhich account for 90% of total freshwater fish supply, is easily available in local markets, and is \npopular among poor families due to its affordable price. \n \n3.  Marketing Channels. As the major market segment for freshwater fish is located within \nthe production area itself, the principal marketing channel is sale to consumers by bicycle \nvendors. However, as demand for freshwater fish beyond the local markets has shown an \nincreasing trend, trading by motorcycle has become more popular due to its efficiency and \nability to serve a wider trading area. This has, in turn, resulted in reduced spoilage and better \nquality of fish, and consequently better prices. Truck vendors mainly serve the large reservoirs \nand engage in wholesale trade in identified markets (i.e., weekly fairs and wholesale markets). \nThe narrow range of market channels for freshwater fish is indicative of the currently limited \ncoverage of small fish traders (mainly in the local markets within a 10 km radius from production \nareas)  as  well  as  the  small  volume  of  marketable  surplus  being  channeled  out  of  these \nproduction areas. \n \n4.  Costs and Margins. A survey conducted in 1986 showed that although a producer \nrealizes a 50% share of the retail price for freshwater fish, the net margin of 22% was less than \nthat of the trader\u2019s net margin of 37%.1 More recent information obtained from case studies \nundertaken during project preparation in 2001 indicates that the situation has not changed, with \nproducer\u2019s and trader\u2019s margin estimated at 21% and 38%, respectively (Table A2.1).2 The high \nprofit margin realized by traders may be attributed to the following: (i) freshwater fish are moved \nfrom the producer in the same form with minimal value added, except cost of transport, to the \nproduct; (ii) marketing chain is short, i.e., producer\u2013retailer\u2013consumer, except with occasional \n                                                 \n1  Agrarian Research and Training Institute. 1986.

Inland fish prices have varied greatly over the years. Tilapia prices have stabilized \naround SLRs45/kg in the Colombo wholesale market, implying that existing supply can meet \ncurrent demand. However, price fluctuations occur within the year due to the seasonal nature of \ntilapia production. For instance, the price per kg observed in 2000 ranged from SLRs39.42 to \nSLRs47.06. \n \nFish Consumption Trends and Demand \n6.  Consumption trends from 1985 to 1997 indicated a growing demand for fish, in general, \nas well as for freshwater and marine fish in both the rural and urban markets (Table A2.2).3 \nOver the period, demand for all types of fish increased from 102,968 t to 116,144 t, an increase \nof about 13%. During the same period, the demand for marine and freshwater fish also showed \nsignificant improvements of about 14% and 7%, respectively. \n \nTable A2.2: Fish Consumption Trends, 1985\u20131997 \n \nConsumption  1985/86  1996/97  Increment \n  (t)  (t)  (t)  (t) \n1.

The  significant  improvement  in  demand  for  freshwater  fish  in  the  urban  market  is \napparent, with an increase in consumption of about 360%. At the same time, freshwater fish \n                                                 \n3  In the absence of time series data, the analysis of fish consumption trends is mainly based on cross-section data \ngenerated by the consumer finance survey for 1985/86 and 1996/97. The survey data underestimate consumption \nas they exclude some consumer categories and cover only 17 districts. However, in the absence of more reliable \ndata, they are indicative of consumption trends. ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nconsumption has decline slightly in the rural areas. The rapid increase in demand for freshwater \nfish in the urban areas during this period created a wider market for the limited supply of \nfreshwater fish and new opportunities to increase household income. The lack of any significant \nmarketable surplus resulted in fish that used to be consumed largely within the local production \nareas  being  sold  in  newly  opened  urban  markets,  resulting  in  a  slight  reduction  in  local \nconsumption.  \n \n8.  The high demand for freshwater fish, relative to current production levels, may also be \ninferred from the following field observations: (i) daily catches from major reservoirs are easily \nabsorbed by the market within a radius of about 10 km; (ii) fishing in tanks is currently subject to \nrules  imposed  by  the  fishing  community  to  prevent  overexploitation  and  poaching  by \nnonmembers; (iii) inland freshwater fish is not available in dried form, indicating that supply does \nnot exceed demand; (iv) the entire supply of filleted fish produced at the Minneriya Filleting \nPlant is absorbed by a ready urban market; and (v) investment by small-scale operators and \ntraders in fishing and aquaculture equipment and facilities continues to grow around the large \nreservoirs despite limitations on support services. \n \nFactors Affecting Demand \n9.  Income. Time series data are not available to estimate income elasticity of demand for \nfish  in  Sri  Lanka.  However,  studies  in  Bangladesh  (which  is  similar  to  Sri  Lanka  in  fish \nconsumption)  indicate  that  income  elasticities  for  different  types  of  fish  (notably  carp)  are \npositive for all income classes, and none of the fish types becomes an inferior good at the \nhighest income quartile.4 Expenditure elasticities of both carp and tilapia were also found to be \npositive in studies in five Asian countries.5 Thus, with the increase in population and per capita \nincome, the demand for fish will increase. \n \n10.  Price.  Freshwater  fish  are  among  the  cheapest  available  in  the  local  market.  The \nfarmgate price of tilapia, for example, varies from SLRs20\u201340 per kg, while its retail price may \nvary from SLRs35\u201355 per kg. Compared with marine fish varieties (such as tuna and mullet), \ntilapia prices are lower by as much as 85% and 75%, respectively. Tilapia is even cheaper (by \n20\u201355%) than low-priced small marine fish varieties. The lower price at which it is sold is, \ntherefore, an important factor in the preference for freshwater fish among rural communities \nwhere incomes are low and poverty incidence is high. \n \n11.  Availability. Per capita consumption of freshwater fish varies from 0.1\u20138.8 kg among all \ndistricts and is observed to be highly correlated with this commodity\u2019s availability. In districts \nsuch as Anuradhapura, Moneragala, and Polonnaruwa, where freshwater fish is commonly \navailable and where consumers have developed a preference for freshwater fish over marine \nfish, per capita consumption of freshwater fish accounts for 89%, 84%, and 55% of total per \ncapita fish consumption, respectively. Further, as most freshwater fish production is undertaken \nby  rural  communities  in  the  large  reservoirs  (generally  for  home  consumption),  per  capita \nconsumption of freshwater fish in rural areas is observed to be higher than consumption levels \nin urban areas. Data from the 1985/86 survey indicate that rural per capita consumption of \nfreshwater fish was 1.15 kg, compared with 0.17 kg for urban areas, while for 1996/97, rural per \ncapita consumption was estimated at 1.0 kg versus 0.61 kg for urban areas. \n12.  Distribution/Market Facilities. The supply of freshwater fish is generally absorbed by \nthe rural market within a 10 km radius of points of production.

", "28  Appendix 2 \nbeyond this distance is constrained by limited distribution/market facilities in rural areas, such as \nlack of feeder/access roads and fish receiving/landing stations. Despite these limitations, a \ngrowing movement of freshwater fish from rural production areas to urban markets has been \nobserved, implying a growing demand for this commodity in these markets. \n \nProjected Demand for and Production of Freshwater Fish \n13.  Based on domestic production, per capita consumption of fish in 1997 is estimated at \n10.6 kg, growing to 11.8 kg in 2001 (footnote 2). Of this, about 12.5% (or 1.5 kg) is freshwater \nfish.  Assuming  an  annual  population  growth  rate  of  about  1.1%  and  projected  per  capita \nconsumption rates for freshwater fish increasing from 1.5 kg to 2.4 kg over the 7-year project \nimplementation period, demand for freshwater fish is expected to increase from 30,500 t in 2003 \nto about 52,000 in 2009. Correspondingly, production of freshwater fish, based on the total \noutput of representative enterprises envisaged under the Project is expected to increase from \n30,500 t in 2003 to about 56,000 t in 2009. Exports are envisaged to start in 2005, when a \nsurplus of about 220 t of freshwater fish production is realized. Increases in export volume are \nprojected until 2009 when about 4,000 t of freshwater fish are expected to be sold in the \ninternational market (Table A2.3). \n \n14.  These  demand  projections  are  largely  premised  on  two  factors:  (i)  population  will \nincrease each year; and (ii) per capita consumption of freshwater fish will increase annually with \nimproved  production  capacity  of  fishers  and  greater  volume  of  freshwater  fish  distributed \nbeyond a 10 km radius of production sites. Another important factor expected to contribute to \nincreased  demand  for  freshwater  fish  is  the  improvement  in  household  incomes  of  target \nbeneficiaries.6  The  benefits  derived  by  these  groups  from  various  project  interventions  to \nincrease  their  productive  capacities  and  technical  capabilities  (such  as  training,  technical \nassistance, and credit) will result in increased production of freshwater fish that may be either \nconsumed at home or sold in the market. \n \nTable A2.3: Freshwater Fish Demand and Production Projections \n \nProjected  Projected Per  Projected  Projected  Export \nPopulationa  Capita  Demand  Productionc  Volume \nYear \n  Consumptionb       \n(million)  (kg/capita)  (t)  (t)  (t) \n2003  19.900  1.53  30,500  30,500   \n2004  20.150  1.56  31,500  31,500   \n2005  20.378  1.74  35,402  35,620     218 \n2006  20.600  1.92  39,571  40,819  1,248 \n2007  20.847  2.13  44,354  46,690  2,336 \n2008  21.097  2.29  48,345  51,687  3,342 \n2009  21.350  2.43  51,860  55,870  4,010 \na  Based on an annual growth rate of about 1.1%. \nb  Projected per capita consumption rates under the Project. \nc  Projected production based on total output of representative enterprises envisaged under the project over \nthe 7-year implementation period. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n                                                 \n6  Incomes of about 130,000 households in the project area are expected to increase by about SLRs12,400 per year. \nAs a result, poverty incidence is expected to decrease from 33% to 23% during project implementation. ", "  Appendix 2  29 \n15.   In view of data shortages for robust formal supply and demand modeling, production \nand consumption surveys are being conducted under a technical assistance7. The surveys, \ninitiated recently, are expected to be completed over the next 12 months, and preliminary \nresults (including elasticities) will be available by end-2003. These results will supplement the \nanalysis done during project preparation and marketing surveys planned for the first year of \nproject implementation. The Project will work closely with the International Center for Living \nAquatic Resources Management which is implementing this TA. \n \nDistribution of Projected Production by Market Segment \n16.  The market for freshwater fish is segmented into three: local, domestic (rural/urban), and \nexport. Each of the three markets is served by a different type of product. Fish for the local \nmarket and other rural areas are mainly small tilapia caught from the large reservoirs. Fish \ndestined for the higher income urban market are mostly the larger, better quality cultured \nspecies. Fish for the export market are primarily processed (filleted) red tilapia, and small \nmilkfish frozen in 5 or 10 kg packs for tuna longline bait.  \n \n17.  Significant opportunities for marketing freshwater fish are opening up beyond the rural \ncommunities  where  these  are  commonly  produced  for  home  consumption.  Per  capita \nconsumption  of  freshwater  fish  in  urban  areas  has  shown  an  increasing  trend  despite \ndistribution constraints that limit the movement of this commodity from the large reservoirs to \nmarkets in other districts where freshwater fish is in low supply but in great demand. This is \ndemonstrated by the substantial increases in the per capita consumption of freshwater fish \nrelative to per capita consumption of all types of fish in the urban areas. During 1986\u20131997, \nurban  consumption  of  freshwater  fish,  as  a  percentage  of  total  urban  fish  consumption, \nincreased four times, from 1.5% to 6.4%.  \n \n18.  Based on the increasing demand for freshwater fish and the wider range of opportunities \nfor  marketing  this  commodity,  a  large  proportion  (about  84%  by  2009)  of  the  incremental \nproduction is expected to be absorbed by the domestic market. During the first 4 years of \nproject implementation, more than 50% of freshwater fish production will be absorbed by the \nlocal market (i.e., within a 10 km radius from the point of production). As production increases, \nand as the demand for freshwater fish increases in other domestic markets, larger volumes will \nbe distributed, and absorbed, in the wider rural market and urban outlets (Table A2.4). By the \nend of project implementation, i.e., 2009, the local market is expected to consume about 25% of \ntotal production, while the wider rural market and urban market are expected to account for 25% \nand 34% market share, respectively. Exports are expected to commence by 2005, at about 210 \nt or about 4% of total freshwater fish production. Volume of exported freshwater fish is projected \nto increase to about 4,000 t in 2009, or about 16% of total freshwater fish production. Exports \nare a small part of incremental production, varying from 4% in 2005 to 16% in 2009. \n \n19.  Worldwide tilapia production increased by more than 280% during 1990\u20131999 (from \nabout 384,000 t in 1990 to 1.1 million t in 1999). International trade in tilapia, as well as other \nfreshwater fish species, also showed an increasing trend over the same period and is expected \nto \u201ccontinue to increase worldwide over the next three decades\u201d as more consumers realize the \nimportance of fish as a cheaper source of protein in their diets.8 Significant volumes of tilapia \nare  currently  being  exported  by  producers  in  Latin  America  (Colombia,  Costa  Rica,  and \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2000.

", "30  Appendix 2 \nEcuador) to the United States, as well as by Asian producers (Indonesia, Taipei,China, and \nThailand) to Japan and the United States. Tilapia exports of Israel, Jamaica, and Zimbabwe to \nthe  European  Community  have  likewise  increased  in  recent  years.  The  biggest  exporter, \nTaipei,China, supplies Japan with high-quality tilapia fillets for the sashimi market and ships \nfrozen tilapia to the American market. Taipei,China in 1998 exported about 35% of its domestic \ntilapia production and supplied 80% of the United States tilapia imports. Indonesia and Thailand \ntrade about 5% of their production in the international market, while Viet Nam has recently \nentered the world tilapia market. Tilapia has become one of the major imported aquaculture \nproduct, by weight, in the United States and in other countries in Europe and Central and South \nAmerica. This may be largely attributed to the growing acceptance and consumption of tilapia as \na close substitute for white fish species that are in short supply today. Moreover, the prices of \ntilapia  are  competitive.  Multinational  companies  have  already  started  investing  in  low-cost, \ntilapia-producing  countries  such  as  Africa.  Private  companies  in  Sri  Lanka  have  been \napproached by importers in Japan, Malaysia, and the United States, who together require \nhundreds of tons of tilapia and milkfish every month.9 \n \nTable A2.4: Distribution of Freshwater Fish Production by Market Segment \n \nCumulative Cumulative Cumulative Incremental Production\nYear  Incremental Incremental Consumed by Consumed by Consumed by Total Consumed by Projected\n  Demanda Productionb Local Marketc Rural Marketd Urban Market Domestic Market Export\n  (t) (%) (t) (%) (t) (%) (t) (%) (t) (%)\n2003              500                 500       425 85%         50 10%         25 5%         500 100%        -        -\n2004           1,501              1,500    1,125 75%       225 15%       150 10%      1,500 100%        - -\n2005           5,402              5,620    3,653 65%    1,012 18%       737 13%      5,402 96%       218 4%\n2006          9,571            10,819    5,630 52%    2,164 20%    1,777 16%      9,571 88%    1,248 12%\n \n2007        14,354            16,690    7,263 44%    3,839 23%    3,252 19%    14,354 86%    2,336 14%\n \n2008        18,345            21,687    5,855 27%    5,205 24%    7,285 34%    18,345 85%    3,342 15%\n \n2009        21,860            25,870    6,468 25%    6,468 25%    8,923 34%    21,860 84%    4,010 16%\n \naBased on projected demand for freshwater fish.\n \nbBased on projected freshwater fish production.\ncWithin th e 10-km radius from point of production.\ndRural ma rket beyond the 10-km radius from point of production.\n \nProduction Trend and Outlook \n20.  The production of freshwater fish has been increasing since 1996 despite lack of a \nconducive environment (e.g., lack of fish seed, inadequate technical support, lack of appropriate \ntechnology,  lack  of  credit,  weak  institutional  support)  to  encourage  further  investment  in \nproduction ventures by community-based organizations (CBOs) and private investors. Despite \nthese  constraints,  the  private  sector\u2014particularly  CBOs  located  near  the  perennial  and \nseasonal tanks\u2014has been taking the lead in inland fisheries and aquaculture production. As the \nCBOs are operated and managed by poor rural communities with limited financial resources, \nthe risk of engaging in such ventures is considerably high. However, the risk is mitigated by the \nreadiness of the market to absorb their produce. The outlook for increasing production of \nfreshwater fish is bright, and increases in supply are expected to be readily absorbed as a \nconsequence of significant increases in demand for freshwater fish in the rural and urban \nmarkets as well as in the international market. \n \n                                                 \n9  Josupeit, H., Lem, A., and Lupin, H. 2001.

", "40  Appendix 9 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.  Poverty in Sri Lanka \n1.  The United Nations ranked Sri Lanka 84th among 174 countries in terms of human \ndevelopment index in 2000. Sri Lanka has made substantial gains in reducing poverty, as \nreflected in its human development index of 0.73, being by far the highest in South Asia. It ranks \nwith  more  economically  advanced  countries  like  Malaysia  and  Thailand  in  terms  of  basic \nindicators of human well-being, due to widespread access to basic social services. Poverty in \nSri  Lanka  is,  therefore,  linked  more  to  income  and  consumption  than  to  access  to  basic \nservices.  \n \n2.  Absolute  poverty  in  Sri  Lanka  is  measured  through  a  food  poverty  line  using  the \nestimated cost per capita of a basket of foodstuffs that satisfies minimum energy and protein \nrequirements plus other goods that satisfy minimum nonfood consumption requirements. As this \n\u201clower poverty line\" does not capture the full effects of poverty, 20% is added to it to derive the \nso-called  \"higher  poverty  line.\"  In  Sri  Lanka  about  3.3  million  out  of  17.5  million  people \n(excluding the population of the North-Eastern Province) were classified as poor in 1996/97, \nusing the lower poverty line, while according to the higher poverty line 4.5 million out of 17.5 \nmillion people are classified as poor.1 The current national poverty incidence is estimated to be \nabout 24%.  \n \n3.  In North-Eastern Province, poverty has a different nature, coexisting with physical injury, \npsychological stress, and war-related trauma. The area has been excluded from official surveys \nduring the last 17 years; however, the limited data available suggest that this area is deprived of \nbasic  services,  economic  activities  are  hardly  taking  place,  and  close  to  two  thirds  of \nhouseholds  are  displaced.  In  the  recently  signed  Poverty  Partnership  Agreement,  the \nGovernment of Sri Lanka and Asian Development Bank (ADB) agree that little progress can be \nmade in reducing poverty in the northern and eastern part of the country until the peace process \nmoves forward. \n \n4.  Poverty in Sri Lanka is also a predominantly rural phenomenon with 87% of the poor \nliving in rural areas, and distinct regional variations in poverty existing at provincial and district \nlevels, as well as within districts. There are indications that a significant percentage of the \nnonpoor are living marginally above subsistence level and thus highly vulnerable to transitory \nepisodes of poverty caused by seasonal unemployment or food shortages. Overall, about 40% \nof the country\u2019s population is either poor or vulnerable to poverty. \n \n5.  Sri Lanka has a long tradition of poverty reduction programs, with the first food aid \nprogram introduced in 1939 under British rule. In recent times, numerous welfare programs \nhave been introduced, two major ones being Janasaviya and Samurdhi. Between 1989 and \n1995, Janasaviya was the country\u2019s main program for social assistance. The success of this \nprogram is mixed. While studies show that around 25% of families assisted by this program \nimproved their income, the program was not targeted enough and about half of the Sri Lankan \n                                                 \n1 These poverty lines follow the Central Bank data giving an estimate for 1996/97 for the lower poverty line at \nSLRs860 per person per month and the higher poverty line at SLRs1,032 per person per month. They are used in \nthe Framework of Poverty Reduction of the Government of Sri Lanka. The Department of Census and Statistics \nassesses poverty using a larger household income and expenditure survey than the central bank and comes up \nwith a different set of poverty lines (at SLRs791 and SLRs950). According to the Poverty Partnership Agreement \nbetween the Government of Sri Lanka and the Asian Development Bank, signed on 8 March 2002, the Department \nof Census and Statistics will continue to assess and monitor the changes in poverty incidence using the latter \nbaseline poverty lines.  ", "  Appendix 9  41 \npopulation received support. The Samurdhi program was introduced in 1994 with the change in \ngovernment. It has three components (i) providing food stamps, which claims 80% of the \nSamurdhi budget; (ii) a savings and credit program providing loans for entrepreneurial and \nbusiness development; and (iii) rehabilitating and developing community infrastructure. It has \nalso involved large income transfers to cover nearly 50% of the population, more than twice the \nnumber estimated to be poor. This has resulted in a general mind-set among the population \nexpecting government services free of charge and is not conducive to achieving self-reliant \ndevelopment. The Government recognizes the need to seek new approaches, as reflected in its \nFramework for Poverty Reduction and the Poverty Partnership Agreement with ADB.  \n \nB.  Poverty and Social Dimensions in the Project Area \n1.   The Population  \n6.  The total population in the nine districts of the project area is 6.1 million in 1.5 million \nhouseholds with an average household size of 4.4. They consist of 82.9% Sinhalese, 12.3% \nTamils, 3.8% Muslims, and less than 1% other groups. Slightly more females (51.9%) than \nmales (48.1%) live in the project area. Surveys conducted during project preparation estimate \nthat about 34% of the population in the project area live below the poverty line. Poverty is \nhighest in Moneragala (50.4%), followed by Ratnapura (46.7%), Badulla (41.6%), Polonnaruwa \n(37.7%), Hambantota (34.7%), and Puttalam (33%), compared with Nuwara Eliya (25.7%), \nKurunegala (26.9%), and Anuradhapura (21.06%).2 \n \n7.  Social Stratification. A small group of the poorest of the poor (about 1% of the total \nnumber of households targeted) gets its income from marginal employment working as casual \nlaborers,  being  seasonally  employed  as  farm  workers,  and  receiving  subsidies  from  the \nGovernment. To supplement their meager diet these people are forced to engage in illegal \nfishing.  \n \n8.  The  groups  living  below  and  just  above  the  poverty  line  (about  56%  of  the  target \npopulation) consist of full-time and part-time fisherfolk, assistants in fishing, bicycle fish vendors, \nsmall  farmers,  and  small-scale  animal  husbandry  operators.  They  will  be  the  main  target \nbeneficiaries  of  this  Project.  A  large  number  of  respondents  coming  from  these  groups  \nexpressed the need for more job opportunities, increased incomes, extension service, and \naccess to credit.  \n \n9.  In Sri Lanka\u2019s system of social stratification, caste still plays a role. However, economic \ngroups are not divided on ethnic lines. Fishers are traditionally considered lower in social \nstanding than agriculturalists. The fisher caste, karava, is mainly limited to the coastal areas. \nHowever, the low status attributed to the fishing occupation is also noted in inland areas. In \naddition, fishing is an activity that complements agricultural labor and people do not go into \nfishing by choice but by necessity. Capture fishing or aquaculture as an alternative income \nopportunity therefore needs to be promoted. \n \n10.  Agriculture  and  Fishing.  The  freshwater  fishery  is  considered  to  be  part  of  the \nagriculture sector not only in the Sri Lanka departmental setup and databases, but also in \npeople\u2019s general understanding. In the dry zone, a tank is the main water body on which the \ncommunity  depends  for  its  livelihood.  In  particular,  those  people  who  cannot  subsist  on \nagricultural activities, take up fishing as a supplemental activity. Consequently, there are only a \n                                                 \n2  Source: Government of Sri Lanka. 2000. Sri Lanka: A Framework for Poverty Reduction. Colombo. ", "42  Appendix 9 \nfew  genuine  fisherfolk;  most  of  the  population  is  active  to  various  degrees  in  agriculture, \nlivestock, and fishing activities. \n \n11.  Dietary Imbalance. The amount and the sources of calorie intake in the urban, rural, \nand estate areas vary significantly. The per capita consumption of rice and wheat flour is about \none third higher in the rural and estate areas than in the urban areas. The proportion of protein \nin the daily diet shows a pattern in the other direction: In urban areas the consumption of beef \nand chicken is almost three times the proportion of animal protein in the rural areas. Sea fish is \nthe principal source of protein in all areas, but consumption in urban areas is almost double that \nof rural areas and 10 times that of the estates. Freshwater fish still plays a minor role in urban \nareas. Consumption is higher in the rural areas, but overall restricted due to lack of availability. \n \n12.  Lack of Access to Services. Especially small perennial and seasonal tanks are located \nin  remote  and  sparsely  populated  areas,  where  access  to  services  is  more  limited. \nConsequently, the incidence of poverty is higher here than around larger perennial tanks. Some \n22% of the total households in the project area do not have latrines and only 58% have access \nto safe drinking water. About 30% of the total households are connected to electricity. However, \nthe nine districts have sufficient schools and an adequate number of teachers. Access to \nextension services is a major problem. Not only does the extension staff lack skills and are \nlimited in number, they are also handicapped by the unavailability of transport and have no \nincentives to go to these more remote areas.  \n \n13.  Conflicting Interests. The respondents of the project preparatory technical assistance \n(TA) survey described a variety of different conflicts related to fisheries: (i) access to water \nbetween farmers and fishers in areas where water availability is low and irregular; (ii) extension \nstaff being biased toward particular political groups and more affluent clients; and (iii) fisherfolk \nhaving engaged in extremely imbalanced relationships with affluent truck-owning fish vendors, \nparticularly in some larger perennial tanks in the south. The dependence between fishers and \ntraders is a significant feature of the sector. Traders provide fishing equipment, nets, and boats \non a credit basis and purchase the produce from the fisher. The relationship between the small \nfisher and the small bicycle vendor is more balanced. But with bigger vendors, the fishers \nbecome more disadvantaged, do not get their due share, and are pressured to accept lower \npurchase prices. This has in some communities developed into open confrontation and disrupts \ncommunity life. Ethnicity does not, however, play any role in these conflicts. \n \n2.  Community-Based Organizations and the Role of NGOs \n14.   The organizational degree of the population in the project area is generally high. The \nsurvey results show that the majority of households (91%) have at least one member of a \nvoluntary organization, 25.5% report being a member of a fisheries society in perennial tanks, \nwhile organizational degree is only 1.5% in seasonal tanks.3 The Government\u2019s former welfare-\noriented policies are reflected in the perceptions and expectations of the organizations and their \nmembers. Society members frequently complain about lack of support from the Government \nand expect subsidized provision of fingerlings, gear, and boats. While government benefits \ncannot be accessed without joining an organization, quite often the provision of benefits does \nnot necessarily reflect the neediness of the recipients (Table A9.1). The organizations face \nproblems related to financial management and leadership.  \n \n                                                 \n3  As fisherfolk can also be organized as subgroups of farmers\u2019 organizations, this figure may be an underestimate.  ", "  Appendix 9  43 \n15.  The  Small  Fishers\u2019  Federation  supports  marine  and  inland  fisherfolk  community \norganizations and provides training to CBOs in fisheries. A number of NGOs are active in \nproviding services and support to fishing communities, particularly in the areas of small-scale \ncredit,  employment  generation,  and  welfare  activities.  They  assist  in  establishing  pension \nschemes, providing relief and rehabilitation for displaced fishers, improving income of women in \nfishing communities, setting up fishers\u2019 organizations, training youth for offshore fishing, and \nassisting in the provision of small fishing craft or in accessing credit.  \n \nTable A9.1: Overall Demographic Information\u2014District Summary \nHH with  HH with   Monthly  HH \nProper  Safe  HH  Assisted by  Poverty \nHouseholds  HH  Toilets  Drinking  Income  Welfarea   Incidence \nDistrict  Population  (HH)  Size  (%)  Water (%)  (SLRs)  (% of total)  (%) \nKurunegala  1,452,369  361,057  4.0  \u2013  \u2013  7,678  225,145 (59.2)  26.9 \nAnuradhapura  746,466  155,180  4.8  74.0  71.7  9,279  101,337(49.2)  21.6 \nPolonnaruwa  359,197  91,145  3.9  85.3  64.2  7,052  40,435 (44.4)  37.7 \nNuwara Eliya  700,083  168,609  4.2  86.4  \u2013  9,192  57,203 (33.9)  25.7 \nBadulla  774,555  168,870  4.6  87.9  63.0  7,202  73,742 (43.6)  41.6 \nMoneragala  396,173  83,557  4.7  84.5  45.1  5,646  87,507 (22.1)  50.4 \nRatnapura  1,008,164  245,585  4.1  87.0  67.0  6,139  146,012 (59.4)  46.7 \nHambantota  525,370  105,174  5.0  91.0  71.0  6,272  78,282 (57.0)  34.7 \nPuttalam  601,104  133,578  4.5  73.0  81.0  6,694  72,573 (54.3)  33.0b \nTotal  6,563,481  1,512,755  4.3  83.7  67.3  7.373  882,236 (58.3)  34.1 \n\u2013 = not available HH = household. \na  Under the Samurdhi Program. \nb  Lower poverty line from Sri Lanka: A Framework for Poverty Reduction, November 2000.

Unlike in marine fisheries, where women are actively involved in most areas (e.g., \nshallow water and lagoon fishing, fish processing, and small vendor trading), women are seldom \ninvolved in inland fisheries. Only a few women are engaged in capture fishery, and in these \ncases, only because of their special situations being either single parents or coming from very \nmarginal communities. Processing of freshwater fish plays only a minor role because there is \nseldom any surplus. As women are rarely involved in aquaculture-related activities in the project \narea, their participation in fishers\u2019 associations is low. They have joined, because they expected \nbenefits from their membership not necessarily related to fisheries. But they have expressed \ngreat interest in increasing their involvement and experiences in coastal fisheries show that \nwomen can play a major role.  \n \nC.  The Project\u2019s Poverty and Social Strategy \n17.  Targeted Interventions. While all groups will be involved in the Project and will benefit \naccording to economic activity (not ethnicity), the Project will undertake a thorough analysis of \nsubgroups  of  target  beneficiaries  with  the  main  group  being  the  female  and  male  rural \npopulation living below and just above the poverty line. Their needs will be addressed through \ntargeted  interventions  (Table  A9.2).  They  will  be  provided  access  to  extension  services, \nincluding access to sources of fish seeds and fish culture information, access to credit, and \ntraining  on  fish  production  and  improved  fish  handling.  Already  existing  CBOs  will  be \nstrengthened  using  participatory  approaches,  starting  with  gender-sensitive  participatory \nassessments of organizational capacities. In seasonal and minor tanks new groups will be \norganized by NGOs. All training will be hands-on, participatory, and adapted to the needs of the \nrespective target group. The Project will particularly attempt to reach the group of the poorest of \nthe poor,  by  providing  training in skills  needed in fisheries  (e.g., net mending) and supporting ", "44  Appendix 9 \nthe use of their newly acquired skills. Specific, alternative income opportunities will prevent \nfurther illegal fishing by this group.  \n \n18.  Conflict  Management.  The  Project  will  not  include  any  tanks  where  conflicts  are \nongoing until the conflicts have been solved to the satisfaction of the parties involved. As a \nmitigating measure, the Project will provide for mediation and negotiation in these cases. More \nsuch conflicts could arise as a result of increased utilization of seasonal and minor perennial \ntanks  for  culture-based  fisheries.  Conflict  management  training  will  be  provided  to  CBOs, \nextension staff and NGOs enabling them to handle such problems at the local level. As a \npreventive measure, a thorough situation analysis and discussion of implications of any planned \nactivity at the target group level will be discussed with the population prior to any project \nintervention.  \n \n19.  Poverty Orientation and Participation. Active stakeholder participation is considered \nthe key to strong project ownership. During project preparation, the stakeholders participated \nthrough  local  consultations  and  focus  group  discussions,  and  stakeholder  representatives \nincluding NGOs participated in three national workshops.4 Strong beneficiary participation needs \nto be institutionalized in project implementation. This will be achieved by training extension staff \nof  NAQDA  and  using  a  consistent  participatory  approach  in  supporting  institutional \nstrengthening  of  CBOs,  NGOs,  and  other  agencies  involved  in  the  Project.  Participatory \nmonitoring and evaluation will be introduced and become a major monitoring tool for the CBOs. \n \n20.  The Project will define social selection criteria and adopt a phased approach, assuring \nsmall perennial and seasonal tanks are prioritized in project interventions. The Project will \nimprove the mobility of the extension staff and establish an incentive system encouraging and \nenabling them to reach the more remote areas of the project districts.  \n \n21.  Gender  Strategy.  The  Project  will  encourage  women\u2019s  participation  and  provide \nopportunities for them to play active roles in setting up, operating, and managing small-scale \nculture-based fishery enterprises. The formation and strengthening of fishers\u2019 associations will \nensure  equitable  opportunities  for  (i)  membership  and  representation  of  women,  and  (ii) \nassuming leadership functions in these associations.  \n \n22.  The  conduct  of  training  courses  will  be  scheduled  with  special  considerations  of \nwomen\u2019s availability. They will include entrepreneurial skills development, inland fishery and \naquaculture production and management techniques, simple record and bookkeeping, credit \nand debt service management, and leadership formation.  \n \n23.  Gender awareness training will be provided to NAQDA staff at all levels. A proven track \nrecord  on  gender  inclusion  in  project  activities  will  become  a  selection  criteria  for  NGOs. \nNAQDA will fill its vacant positions by giving preference to hiring women. One PMO staff \nmember will be designated as the gender focal point being responsible for organizing such \ntraining,  coordinating  gender-related  activities,  and  advising  and  monitoring  that  gender \nconcerns are incorporated into project activities. Gender-disaggregated data will be collected \nthrough the baseline benefit monitoring and evaluation survey as well as in the subsequent \nsurveys to be conducted at project midterm and completion. Gender indicators will be included \nin the project performance management system, and will become an important element in the \nevaluation system for the PMO and NGOs. \n                                                 \n4 The inception workshop was conducted using goal-oriented project planning as a recognized participatory method.

Introduction \n1.  In accordance with Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines, an initial environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  was  carried  out  as  an  integral  part  of  the  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance. The IEE assessed likely environmental impacts of project implementation, and \nidentified measures needed to prevent or mitigate any possible adverse impacts. In view of the \nextensive  geographic  scope  of  the  proposed  Project  and  the  large  number  of  sites  for \nestablishment of the interventions and model enterprises, a generic IEE was prepared for each \nintervention regardless of the site for its establishment. The Project is classified as environment \ncategory B, as per ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Environmental Assessment of Project Impacts. Project \ninterventions were screened with reference to ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected \nAgricultural and Natural Resources Development Projects.  \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n2.  The Project will promote market-driven and sustainable management of inland fisheries \nand  aquaculture.  The  Project  will  be  largely  implemented  in  the  country\u2019s  dry  zone,  and \ncomprises five components: (i) inland fisheries and aquaculture development; (ii) fish quality \nimprovement  and  marketing,  (iii)  credit,  (iv)  institutional  strengthening,  and  (v)  project \nmanagement. Details of the Project are given in the main text of the report.  \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n3.  Physical and Ecological Features. Climatically, the island is characterized by the \neffects of two monsoons: the southwest monsoon from May to September and the northeast \nmonsoon from October to March. Based on the rainfall pattern, the island is divided into three \nagro-ecological zones: wet, dry, and intermediate. The dry zone comprises over 70% of the land \narea, receives less than 1,000 millimeters of annual rainfall during the northeast monsoon. \nAverage annual temperature in the lowlands from 1961\u20131990 was 27oC. Relative humidity \nvaries from 70% during the daytime to 90% in the nighttime. Rainfall is the main source of \nfreshwater in Sri Lanka.  \n \n4.  Sri Lanka has 103 river basins, which cover a total surface area of 65,525 square \nkilometers these have 18,387 tanks. The country has about 260,000 hectares (ha) of freshwater \nbodies consisting of about 155,000 ha of small, medium, and large perennial reservoirs; about \n100,000 ha of seasonal tanks; and about 5,000 ha of floodplain lakes. Based on their size and \nfishery management norms, the reservoirs are classified as (i) large (more than 800 ha) and \nmedium  (200\u2013800  ha)  reservoirs,  used  for  capture  fishery;  (ii)  small  (1\u2013200  ha)  irrigation \nreservoirs, used for culture-based fishery; and (iii) seasonal tanks, which hold water for 6\u20138 \nmonths a year, also used for culture fishery. The annual production potential of these inland \nwater  bodies  has  been  estimated  at  about  60,000  t  from  both  capture  and  culture-based \nfisheries. \n \n5.  The actual number of freshwater fish species endemic to Sri Lanka is uncertain, but \nspecies diversity is low and had to be supplemented through the introduction of exotic species. \nThe  most  successful  fish  introduction  in  river  and  reservoir  fisheries  is  the  Oreochromis \nmossambicus (earlier known as Tilapia mossambica), and has been singled out as the species \nresponsible for the establishment of a viable reservoir fishery on the island. Within a year of its \nintroduction in 1952, O. mossambicus established natural populations in a number of reservoirs, ", "  Appendix 10  47 \nleading to a steep increase in fish yields. Since then, the reservoir fishery, which used to be at a \nsubsistence level, was elevated to a commercial fishery. Other cichlids (tilapia family) were \nsubsequently introduced, and O. niloticus (a species of tilapia) has performed well in reservoirs. \nThe Indian and Chinese major carps have been introduced but have not bred naturally, although \nthey have been bred in hatcheries. Two indigenous species of carp (Labeo dussumieri and \nPuntius sarana) have also been reported in commercial catches from the country\u2019s reservoirs, \nand other species, such as Wallago (a catfish) and Channa (a snakehead), are found in the \ncatches in small numbers. \n \n6.  The coast of Sri Lanka is endowed with rich aquatic habitats. About 45 brackish water \nestuaries and lagoons are spread throughout the coastline with a combined water surface area \nof 158,017 ha, along with about 710 square kilometers of mangrove swamps, mudflats, and salt \nmarshes along the coastline, of which 35 square kilometers have been converted into prawn \nponds. At present, P. monodon (jumbo tiger prawn) is the only brackish water species produced \non  a  commercial  scale  in  the  coastal  areas  of  the  country.  Other  brackish  water  species \npresently  being  grown  in  Sri  Lanka  are  mud  crab  (Scylla  serrata),  oysters  (Crassostrea \nmadrasensis), mussels (Perna perna and P. viridis), and seaweed Gracilaria sp. The brine \nshrimp, Artemia salina, has also been cultured in salterns in Palavi  (North Western Province) \nand in Hambantota and Bundala (Southern Province), where the prevailing extreme conditions \nof evaporation and high salinity favor Artemia growth and reproduction.  \n \n7.  Human and Economic Development. The 2001 total population of the eight districts in \nwhich most project interventions are to be established was about 6.1 million, with an average \nhousehold size of 4.4. Kurunegala and Ratnapura are the two most populated districts. In the \ninland rural areas, income is generally sourced from agriculture, commerce, or microenterprises. \nThe greater percentage of income is sourced from agriculture, and a majority are wage-earning \nagricultural  workers.  They  own  no  land  and  often  have  no  access  to  production  outputs. \nAppendix 9 gives details of socioeconomic conditions in the project area. \n \n8.  Quality of Life Values. Many of the small perennial and seasonal tanks are situated in \nremote and sparsely populated areas. Consequently, basic infrastructure is limited. Access is a \nproblem because of the absence of, or low-grade, roads, and access to safe drinking water, \nelectricity, and proper sanitation is inadequate. Health services are also limited, but the number \nof schools and teacher is adequate. \n \n9.  Archeological or Historical Treasures. Anuradhapura has a number of landmarks and \nsites often visited by tourists. Polonnaruwa has six archeological sites, all protected areas. In \naddition,  the  project  area  has  10  wildlife  reserves  and  four  protected  forests.  Project \ninterventions will not be located close to these protected sites. \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n10.  An  initial  screening  of  possible  environmental  impacts  of  project  components  was \nundertaken at an early stage of project preparation to determine which components would \nrequire further examination. The results indicated that two of the five components needed more \ninvestigation, inland fisheries and aquaculture development, and fish quality improvement and \nmarketing. Using ADB\u2019s Checklist of Environmental Parameters for Fisheries and Aquaculture \nProjects, the following prototype interventions were screened to segregate those parameters \nwith \u201cno significant impacts\u201d from those with significant adverse impacts (small, moderate, or \nmajor): (i) culture-based fisheries in minor reservoirs and seasonal tanks, (ii) water-based mini-\nhatcheries, (iii) land-based mini-hatcheries, (iv) red tilapia culture in brackish water ponds, and ", "48  Appendix 10 \n(v) small-scale infrastructure development (i.e., demonstration facilities, physical renovation of \naquaculture development centers\u2014ADCs, markets, processing plants). \n \n11.  These prototype interventions are not expected to result in significant impacts due to \ninadequate  design  or  operation  and  maintenance.  Nor  were  any  likely  significant  impacts \nidentified based on the critical environmental review criteria in the ADB checklist. However, \nmost of the prototype interventions could have small or moderate impacts due to site selection \nand/or inadequate design, and small impacts during the construction stage for the small-scale \ninfrastructure  development  and  market  establishment.  The  potential  small  and  moderate \nimpacts identified (in accordance with the checklist) and recommended mitigation measures are \nsummarized in Table A10.1. \n \nTable A10.1: Summary of Potential Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \nPrototype  Potential Impacts  Suggested Mitigation Measures \nInterventions \nCulture-based  Conflicts with other  Consensus building and full community involvement in planning and \nfisheries in  site uses  management of the program; adequate social preparation, \nseasonal tanks  community organization, and public education; adequate orientation \nof community leaders  \n  Remoteness from  Establishment of fish marketing and distribution network commencing \nmarketing  from fish receiving stations close to tanks and ending at the Dambulla \nWholesale Fish Market for distribution to Colombo an other sites \n  Water quality and  Timely availability of fish fingerlings to take advantage of seasonality \nquantity  of water availability in tanks \n  Availability of  Increased seed production at renovated and upgraded ADCs \njuvenile stock  augmented by production in privately run minihatcheries \n  Security from  Strengthening of community monitoring and surveillance \npoachers \nLand-based mini- Cost of importing  Formulation of low-cost feeds using locally available raw materials; \nhatcheries  needed fish feeds  continuing feed development research and field verification trials at \nthe aquaculture development center (ADCs) under the technical \nguidance of  a fish-feed technologist  \nWater-based mini- Conflicts with other  Proper site selection to avoid navigational problems \nhatcheries  site uses \n  Remoteness from  Establishment and strengthening of linkages between fingerling \nmarketing  producers and outgrowers  \n  Cost of importing  Formulation of low-cost feeds using locally available raw materials; \nneeded fish feeds  continuing feed development research and field verification trials at \nthe aquaculture development center (ADCs) under the technical \nguidance of a fish-feed technologist \nRed tilapia and  Increased  Construction of sedimentation or settling ponds for drain water prior \nmilkfish culture in  eutrophication in  to release into the open waters; strict enforcement of this prerequisite \nbrackish water  receiving waters  as a condition for licensing \nponds \nSmall-scale  Dust and noise  Proper construction planning; construction only during daytime \nInfrastructure \nDevelopment  \n  Road traffic (for  Putting up of road signs to advise public of construction and suggest \nmarkets)  alternate routes  \n \n12.  Social conflicts, which may arise as a result of the increased utilization of seasonal and \nminor perennial tanks for culture-based fisheries, will be mitigated through the social preparation \nand  mobilization  activities  of  the  Project.  Security  problems  associated  with  culture-based \nfisheries in seasonal tanks, such as could arise from poaching of fish, will be prevented or at \nleast  minimized  by  self-regulation  through  community  monitoring  and  surveillance  efforts. \nMarketing problems, which could result from the remoteness of the fish production sites, will be ", "  Appendix 10  49 \nminimized by the establishment of a fish marketing and distribution network commencing at the \nfish-landing and receiving stations close to the reservoirs/tanks and transported to the Dambulla \nwholesale market for distribution to Colombo and other markets. The potential problem of \nshortage of fish fingerlings for stocking in the seasonal tanks and minor reservoirs will be \nconsiderably reduced by increased seed production at the aquaculture development center \n(ADCs),  augmented  by  the  production  of  the  land-  and  water-based  minihatcheries  to  be \nestablished under the Project. \n \n13.  Potentially adverse impacts of the introduction of red tilapia and milkfish culture in \nabandoned shrimp ponds will be mitigated by imposing a strict requirement for construction of \nsettling  or  sedimentation  ponds  for  pond  water  before  discharge  into  open  waters.  Other \npotential adverse impacts that are likely during construction of various physical facilities\u2014such \nas dust, noise, and increased road traffic\u2014are localized and temporary in nature, and the \nnegative effects on the population will be minimized through careful planning and adoption of \nproper construction practices. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n14.  The interventions identified as having potential negative environmental impacts should \nbe  monitored,  particularly  those  with  effects  predicted  due  to  site  selection.  Water  quality \nmonitoring should be conducted in the perennial reservoirs where water-based minihatcheries \nare installed, in the seasonal tanks, and in the land-based hatcheries and other culture facilities \nto  be  set  up  by  the  Project.  The  following  essential  water  quality  parameters  should  be \nmonitored regularly: (i) pH; (ii) dissolved oxygen; (iii) biochemical oxygen demand (BOD); (iv) \nnutrient concentration (nitrates, nitrites, ammonia, phosphates); (v) suspended solids; and (vi) \norganochlorines. In the open waters, water samples should be regularly collected at sampling \nsites within the project area, and examined in the laboratory using appropriate equipment. The \nsampling frequency will vary with the type of operation. For example, water quality monitoring in \nland-based  minihatcheries  will  have  to  be  done  more  frequently  than  in  the  water-based \nhatcheries and growout farms. Analysis of water samples will be done with the use of water- \nquality test kits to be provided to the ADCs under the Project. Portable test kits will also be \nprovided for use by extension staff for routine monitoring of water quality in the minihatcheries to \nbe put up by the private sector. Water quality monitoring results should be compared with official \nwater  quality  standards  established  by  the  Central  Environment  Authority  as  well  as  with \ninternational water quality standards set by the World Health Organization. This is necessary to \ndetermine whether an indicator exceeds maximum allowable levels.  \n \n15.  In  addition  to  water  quality  monitoring,  socioeconomic  impacts  of  the  project \ninterventions  must  be  monitored,  particularly  with  respect  to  the  perennial  reservoirs  and \nseasonal tanks where social conflicts could arise due to the use of water for fisheries. It will also \nbe useful to collect data on the income of small-scale fishers/farmers and community members, \nincluding women, involved in the Project, and to document conflicts between community groups, \nnoting the mechanism or the mode of conflict resolution, in particular. The National Aquaculture \nDevelopment Authority (NAQDA) regional extension offices (REOs) and the nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) contracted by the project management office (PMO) will play a key role in \nthis task. They will have to work closely with community leaders and local community-based \norganizations  (CBOs),  and  elicit  their  support  and  cooperation,  through  the  field  project \nimplementation officers, when conflict situations arise. \n \n16.  The results of environmental monitoring at the field level should be compiled by the \nREOs and ADCs, and transmitted to the national inland fisheries and aquaculture information \nsystem (NIFAIS) for storage and easy retrieval when needed. As the ADCs will be linked to the ", "50  Appendix 10 \nNIFAIS database through a wide area network, data accessibility should not be a problem. \nEnvironmental monitoring will be the responsibility of NAQDA technical field staff with support \nfrom the PMO. The environmental monitoring program will be designed by the PMO with \ntechnical  advice  from  an  environment  specialist  to  be  engaged  as  part  of  the  project \nmanagement  consultant  team.  The  PMO,  with  assistance  from  the  consultants  and  the \nparticipating academic and research institutions, as required, will supervise implementation of \nthe monitoring program by NAQDA field staff. The NGOs will be asked to educate the small-\nscale fishers/farmers and CBOs on the need for regular water quality monitoring of their culture \nfacilities. Training courses to be delivered to the target beneficiaries will include a module on \nenvironmental monitoring and management in support of production. \n \n17.  NGOs and NAQDA field extension personnel will monitor socioeconomic parameters. \nThey will work closely with the local communities and CBOs in project implementation. Conflict \nresolution will be one of the areas of emphasis in the training of trainers among the contracted \nNGOs and NAQDA extension staff.  \n \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n18.  Only a few minor environmental impacts are likely as a result of factors related to site \nselection and construction, but these are small and avoidable or mitigable. In the case of \nconstruction-related impacts, these are localized and temporary in nature and can be minimized \nthrough careful planning and the adoption of proper construction practices. Possible adverse \neffects of red tilapia culture in unused or abandoned brackish water shrimp ponds can be \nmitigated by providing sedimentation or settling ponds for drain water prior to release into the \nreceiving waters. Some socioeconomic impacts may result from project implementation in the \nperennial and seasonal tanks, but these can be minimized by participatory mechanisms and the \napplication of conflict resolution techniques under the Project. \n \n19.  Overall,  therefore,  the  Project  is  not  expected  to  result  in  adverse  environmental \nimpacts. Instead, it is likely to bring about positive impacts, including (i) enhanced fisheries \nmanagement in the major and medium perennial reservoirs, (ii) optimal utilization of the natural \nproductivity of minor reservoirs and seasonal tanks, (iii) improved environmental sanitation at \nthe fish-landing sites, (iv) improved quality of fish for human consumption, and (v) greater public \nawareness of the need for resource management and environmental protection. Nevertheless, it \nis suggested that environmental conditions at project sites be monitored regularly to determine \nchanges in the levels of essential environmental parameters that indicate the need for remedial \nor  preventive  measures.  In  addition,  socioeconomic  parameters  need  to  be  monitored, \nparticularly as social conflicts could arise as a result of the increased use of seasonal tanks for \nfisheries. \n \nConclusion \n20.  Based  on  the  findings  of  the  IEE,  the  preparation  of  an  environmental  impact \nassessment is not required. However, environmental criteria should be included among the \ncriteria to be used in selecting sites for project interventions. Site selection criteria for the minor \nperennial reservoirs and seasonal tanks should include minimal susceptibility to flooding and the \npresence of favorable water quality parameters (e.g., pH of 7 and above, conductivity of 200 \numhos/centimeters  and  above,  high  transparency,  low  levels  of  suspended  solids,  and \navailability  of  phytoplankton,  particularly  blue-green  and  green  algae).  Also,  the  model \nenterprises and production facilities to be established under the Project will not be situated in \nareas within or close to protected or environmentally critical areas, and will follow Government \nrequirements in this regard.
