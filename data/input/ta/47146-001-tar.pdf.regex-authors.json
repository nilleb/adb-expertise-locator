Given its mission to serve as a partner and an agent for change in Asia and the Pacific, \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) must continue expanding its role as a knowledge bank that \nprovides  quality  policy  dialogue  on  important economic  issues  and  policies  to  its member \ncountries. The recent  dynamics  of  a more  rapidly  changing global  and  regional  economic \nenvironment demands that ADB strengthen and advance its economic assessments and policy \nrecommendations to ensure relevance.  \n \n2.  Previous  efforts  by  ADB\u2019s  Economics  and  Research  Division  (ERD)  to  enhance \nmacroeconomic  assessments  resulted  in  several  tools  to  assess  different  components  of \nmacroeconomic development. The tools are still used to analyze macroeconomic situations \nindependently, based on specific needs. This research and development technical assistance \n(TA)  seeks  to  provide  a  structured  approach  to  macroeconomic  modeling  and  economic \nassessments that can readily consider changing conditions while considering available country \ninformation. By providing up-to-date economic analysis, ADB is expected to be able to influence \neconomic and policy dialogue within the organization and in its developing member countries \n(DMCs). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Strategy 2020 identifies inclusive growth as one of five key priority research areas.2 \nEconomic growth is necessary to bring about inclusiveness. However, rapid changes in the \nglobal economic environment often disrupt the pattern of economic growth needed to bring \ninclusiveness. To prevent and/or mitigate such disruptions, a better understanding of growth, its \ndrivers, and constraints is required. Continuous monitoring of major macroeconomic issues and \ntrends to analyze their implications for economic growth is an indispensable component of the \neffort. The TA will address the issue by enhancing the capacity to conduct better forecasting \nand analysis of key macroeconomic variables. \n \n4.  The conduct of a proper macroeconomic assessment should rest on three important \npillars: (i) provision of reasonable short- to medium-term forecasts for key macroeconomic \nvariables of global and regional economies, (ii) consistency among the forecast figures within \nthe setting of an aggregate economy, and (iii) ability to monitor potential changes to the forecast \nprofiles based on unfolding developments in the economy.  \n \n5.  In 2008, ERD\u2019s Macroeconomics and Finance Research Division (ERMF) established \nthe interdepartmental Regional Economic Outlook Task Force to provide a forum for the regular \nexchange of information on countries and the external environment to better assess economic \nconditions of each country. Continued subscription to the 5-year global forecasting model of \nOxford Economics enabled assessment of particular global and regional macroeconomic risks.3 \nHowever, volatile economic conditions since the global financial crisis require other tools for the \nconduct of economic analysis to capture changing economic trends. \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 November 2013. \n2  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila.  \n3  Oxford  Economics  provides  global  forecasting  and  quantitative  analysis  for  business  and  government. \nhttp://www.oxfordeconomics.com/ \n ", "2  \n6.  In  2011,  ERD  implemented  a  TA  project  on  strengthening  economic  assessment \ncapacity for Asia and the Pacific. It introduced a tool to ensure consistency among forecast \nvariables for individual member countries, and studied the global projection model (GPM) to \ngenerate  a  multiregional  economic  assessment  useful  for  global  projections  and  policy \nanalyses.4 ADB\u2019s Asian Development Outlook (ADO) publications have benefited from scenario \nanalyses using the earlier versions of the GPM, while a few DMCs have initiated development of \nfinancial programming and policy (FPP)-related databases for their own economic assessments.  \n \n7.  The current TA will reinforce ADB\u2019s macroeconomic assessments and sustain the gains \nand deepen the lessons from the 2011 TA by improving the production of reliable assumptions \nabout  how  the  global  economy  evolves  and  maintaining  consistent  forecasts  for  key \nmacroeconomic variables for regional economies. In addition, the TA will establish a tool for \nmonitoring analysis of selected economies in the region to reflect the rapidly changing economic \nenvironment. It will improve the quality of ADO publications as it reinforces the conduct of \nregional  economic  assessments  within  ADB  and  promotes  deeper  understanding  of \nmacroeconomic changes and policy linkages. The TA will then enhance the quality of policy \ndialogue between ADB and its member countries on important economic issues and policies. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA impact will be an improved policy dialogue environment with the DMCs. This will \nbe done through improved assessments of current macroeconomic situations, which will allow \nfor better judgments in deriving policy alternatives.  \n \n9.  The outcome will be that more timely macroeconomic policy assessments inform more \nrelevant policy advice to DMCs. The macroeconomic monitoring and analytical tools for major \nindustrial  economies  and  selected  DMCs  produced  under  the  TA  will  allow  for  a  better \nevaluation of macroeconomic forecasts that underlie policy recommendations for the DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA has three key outputs.  \n \n11.  Output 1: Reasonable short- to medium-term forecasts provided for the global \neconomic environment. The forecasts are to be used as global baseline scenarios in the ADO \nand  other  relevant  publications.  To  achieve  this,  ADB  will  pursue  a  partnership  with  the \nInternational Monetary Fund to continuously improve the regional model used to assess trends \nin the global economic environment\u2014the GPM-7\u2014to suit internal ADB needs.5 In addition, ADB \nwill maintain its membership in the GPM network to retain the venue for exchanging views about \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Economic Assessment Capacity for Asia and the Pacific \nRegion. Manila (TA 7905-REG, approved on November 2011). \n5  The TA for strengthening economic assessment capacity for Asia and the Pacific (footnote 4) contributed in \ndeveloping a regional model called the GPM6+commodities, which was extensively used in the production of past \nAsian Development Outlook volumes and is currently used to generate global forecasts by the GPM network. The \nGPM6+commodities model divides the global economy into six regions (emerging Asia, Euro area, Japan, Latin \nAmerica, the United States, and the rest of the world) plus an explicit block that models the global commodity \nmarket. The current TA extends the GPM6+commodities model by separating the People\u2019s Republic of China from \nthe emerging Asia block in the model\u2014GPM-7\u2014and will calibrate the model to become a platform to generate \nglobal forecasts that suit ADB needs.  \n ", "  3\nthe latest trends in the global economy with various leading institutions around the world and to \naccess the GPM. Co-hosting one GPM conference to be attended by international finance \ninstitutions and central bankers will be explored. \n \n11.  Output 2: Consistent forecast figures for the DMCs ensured. Adoption of the FPP \nframework will provide growth, inflation, and current account forecasts that are more consistent \nwith individual country economic variables and with the global baseline assumptions produced \nby the first output. This will enhance economic assessments completed by ADB operations \ndepartments that feed into the country strategy programs and country notes.6 The first two \noutputs will further the gains from the 2011 TA (footnote 4) by deepening knowledge on the \nregional model and the FPP framework, and integrate them into ERD and ADB operations. \n \n12.  Output 3: Tools to monitor macroeconomic developments and analyze potential \nchanges to ADB forecasts established. These will be based on the most recent data releases \nand be useful for evaluating policy recommendations cited in ADB publications, such as the \nADO. As outputs 1 and 2 activities produce forecasts for the selected DMCs, output 3 will be \ncomplementary by providing a framework to assess the likelihood that the forecasts will be \nrealized as more data become available. For this TA, DMCs in Southeast and East Asia will be \nselected as pilot cases to demonstrate the development of the monitoring tool and its utility for \neconomic  assessment  and  updating  of  forecasts.7 The  DMCs  will  be  selected  during  TA \nimplementation based on the relative availability of economic data at the desired frequency. At \nleast one Asian Development Fund eligible country belonging to Group A or B will be included in \nthe  TA.  In  addition  to  selected  DMCs  in  Southeast  Asia,  coordination  with  the  regional \ndepartments through the Regional Economic Outlook Task Force will ensure complementarity of \nefforts. \n \n13.  Trainings, seminars, and conferences will be conducted to disseminate and test the TA \nresults.  Participants  will  include  representatives  of  ADB  resident  missions  and  regional \ndepartments, and possibly some economists from the DMCs. To the extent possible, ADB staff \nwill participate in external forums and conferences as resource person(s) to contribute to global \npractices and enhance ADB\u2019s visibility as a knowledge bank.  \n \n14.  The  TA  assumes  that  several  ADO  country  authors  from  resident  missions  and \noperations departments have sufficient understanding of the Excel-based modeling tool (FPP) \nand that sufficiently frequent, accurate, and up-to-date data are available in the selected DMCs. \nThe key risks are that some selected DMCs will have insufficient high-quality data requiring \nfurther processing to make them consistent for analytical use, and that over time changes in \nstatistical methods and/or measurements adopted by countries may require monitoring tools to \nbe reassessed. \n \n                                                \n6  The TA for strengthening economic assessment capacity for Asia and the Pacific (footnote 4) initiated the \nconstruction of the FPP-formatted databases for four DMCs\u2014the Philippines; Sri Lanka; Taipei,China; and Viet \nNam. The current TA aims to complete these databases and add a database for at least two additional DMCs each \nyear.  \n7  Countries in these subregions were also chosen as pilot cases in view of a possible partnership with the ASEAN+3 \n(Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea) \nMacroeconomic Research Office, which is conducting high-frequency economic monitoring activities in these \nsubregions. Once the tools are operating, extension for applications to other DMCs can be considered.  \n \n ", "4  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency,  with  ERMF  as  the  focal  point.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented  from  1  January  2014  to  31  December  2015.  ERD  will  cooperate  with  the \nInternational Monetary Fund to develop baseline scenarios for the global projections; and with \nregional departments and resident missions to formulate the economic assessments, short- to \nmedium-term forecasts,  and  Excel-based  monitoring tools.  Cooperation  with  the  ASEAN+3 \nMacroeconomic Research Office for selected countries in Southeast Asia will also be explored \n(footnote 7). \n \n17.  The TA will require 18 person-months of inputs from international experts in economics \nand 36 person-months of inputs from national consultants to contribute to the development, \nmonitoring, and updating of the baseline scenarios, economic assessment tools, and short- to \nmedium-term forecasts. Up to six resource persons will be retained to act as trainers, facilitators, \nor lecturers during the training and seminars. The outline terms of reference for consultants and \nresource persons are provided in Appendix 3. ERMF staff are expected to participate in external \nconferences as resource persons to present the TA results to a wider audience.   \n \n18.  ADB will engage consultants on an individual basis in accordance with its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All procurement will be done in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nIndividual experts engaged for the 2011 TA to work on short- to medium-term forecasts and the \nFPP  framework  are  expected  to  be  engaged,  subject  to  the  normal  competitive  selection \nprocess. Experts for the third output will be sourced from reputable academic institutions in the \nDMCs. The team leader will act as head of the consultants for outputs 1 and 3, while another \nERMF staff will be the team leader for the output 2 consultants. \n \n19.  All  computer  equipment  purchased  under  the  TA  will  remain  with  ADB  for  use  in \nsubsequent monitoring and database maintenance activities. A certificate of equipment turnover \nand/or disposal will be submitted at the end of TA implementation. The TA proceeds will be \ndisbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time).  \n \n20.  ERMF  will  develop  appropriate  monitoring  and  evaluation  tools  to  ensure  that  all \nconsultants engaged perform their tasks as outlined in the terms of reference. Workshops will \nbe conducted to review, evaluate, and discuss the initial monitoring tools and assessments \nprepared  under  the  TA.  Peer  review  of  the  working  papers  within  ADB  and  in  relevant \ninternational economic forums will be used to disseminate and evaluate the results of the TA.  \n \nIV.
