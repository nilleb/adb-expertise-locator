Ferguson, Country Specialist, PARD ", "I. INTRODUCTION\n1.  The Government of Kiribati expressed a need in late 2006 for technical assistance (TA) \nto improve economic management and conduct public sector reform.1 The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) undertook a country consultation mission in July 2007 to discuss the country\u2019s \nneeds. In August 2007, the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre conducted an in-\ndepth review of public financial management in Kiribati. Its report identified eight areas where \nmanagement needed support: (i) the fiscal strategy and multiyear budget framework, (ii) fishing \nlicense revenue, (iii) cash and treasury, including the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund \n(RERF),  (iv)  customs  duties,  (v)  unproductive  subsidies,  (vi)  planning,  budgeting,  and \nmonitoring, (vii) accounting, and (viii) auditing. A second ADB mission decided that ADB could \nserve Kiribati best by helping implement a multiyear budget framework and addressing the poor \nperformance of public enterprises by supporting reforms through an integrated capacity-building \nprogram.\n2.  A TA fact-finding mission (the Mission) visited Kiribati from 24\u201326 June 2008. It reached \nan understanding in discussions with the Government and other stakeholders on the impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference for consulting services. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2\nII. ISSUES\n3.  Kiribati has experienced slow or even negative growth since 2002. In 2007, economic \ngrowth slowed to an estimated 0.5%. High population growth has increased the impact of this \npoor performance. The Government\u2019s recurrent and development expenditures are the main \ndeterminant of aggregate demand. In 2006, the general government sector made up 47% of the \neconomy and was the country\u2019s primary source of employment.  \n4.  The Government also faced substantial domestic revenue declines between 2001 and \n2005, due primarily to a drop in proceeds from fishing licenses. Other factors included rising \ninternational  commodity  prices,  unstable  RERF  returns  from  volatile  international  capital \nmarkets, and losses incurred by public enterprises. The decline has been offset to some degree \nby  an  increase  in  external  grants-in-aid  but  revenue  flows  need  to  be  improved.  The \nGovernment must recognize that it is restricted in its ability to balance revenue flows and that \nrevenues  from  key  sources  will  always  fluctuate  year  on  year.  Expenditure,  in  particular \nrecurrent expenditure, on the other hand, is much more rigid in nature.  \n5.  As a result, Kiribati has sustained high fiscal deficits since 2003. In 2006\u20132008, they \nreached an estimated A$20 million per annum, or about 20% of gross domestic product. To \nfund this deficit, the RERF, which is the principal source of budget financing, has declined 30% \nsince 2000. In 2007, to finance expenditures and repay loans from the Bank of Kiribati, the \nGovernment sharply increased these drawdowns to A$45 million. While the RERF balance \nremained above an informal benchmark of the real capital value in 1996, a continuation of this \ntrend could undermine the fund\u2019s capacity to fulfill its role as a permanent source of budget \nsupport. Weaker global equity market returns will now necessitate much lower drawdowns and \na more prudent approach to government expenditures in 2008 and 2009. The characteristics of \nKiribati public finances therefore demand a solid fiscal framework that imposes discipline on the \nbudgetary process by restraining the tendency to increase spending in high-revenue years \nwithout regard for sustainability in years when revenue will be poor.  \n                                                \n1  Multidonor (ADB, AusAID, NZAID, and Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre) mission in November\u2013\nDecember 2006, which included Country Economist, A. Huang, Pacific Subregional Office (SPSO). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 June 2008. ", "2\n6.  To strengthen Kiribati\u2019s fiscal position, unnecessary expenditures must also be reduced. \nPublic enterprises operate in most sectors of the economy, including air and sea transport, \nutilities, telecommunications, manufacturing, housing, tourism, finance, media, wholesaling, and \nretailing.  The  legislative  framework  to  ensure  government  oversight  of  public  enterprise \nperformance is not being fully utilized. Subsidies have been scaled back in the recurrent budget \nin recent years but now show up more frequently in the development budget. Most of these \npublic enterprises also rely on the Government to fund major items of capital acquisition or \nreplacement. Some look to the Government to support maintenance and training needs. A \nnumber have government-guaranteed overdraft or term loan facilities with the Bank of Kiribati. \nThere  is  ample  scope  for  reducing  fiscal  leakages  and  paving  the  way  for  private  sector \ndevelopment through the reform of public enterprises.3\n7.  The Kiribati Development Plan 2008\u20132011 (KDP) prioritizes the improvement of the \nGovernment\u2019s fiscal position.4 To achieve this goal, the KDP calls for the Government to commit \nto  fiscal  prudence;  refrain  from  unnecessary  overspending;  strengthen  public  financial \nmanagement through long-term budget strategies, including multiyear budgets; and reduce \nexcessive borrowings by public enterprises. The draft economic and social review of Kiribati \ncalls for stronger revenue and expenditure planning, implemented by positive management \nusing up-to-date information within a realistic statement of medium-term public financial policy \nand annual budgets transparently set in a published multiyear framework.5\n8.  Limited human capacity has been a perennial problem for the Government. Of the 120 \nstaff members of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MFED), fewer than 20 \nhave an academic degree and require on-the-job training to lift their performance. Fifty posts \nremain vacant. Technical advice and support to counterparts is needed to move through the \nprioritized  changes  and  reforms.  Personnel  management  must  be  improved.  This  is  a \nconsiderable task that can only be pursued through the Public Service Commission. \n9.  Kiribati has received ADB TA in economic and fiscal management, albeit heavily focused \ntowards national planning and utility management, since the early 1990s. ADB provided TA \nbetween  1997  and  2002  to  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  what  is  now  MFED  in \ndevelopment policy analysis and planning and budget formulation, execution, and monitoring.6\nThese efforts encountered difficulties, including the engaged consultants\u2019 lack of expertise in \ntraining and facilitation, delays in redirecting TA to respond to the dynamic political economy, \nweak capacity in key ministries, resistance to change due to a lack of understanding on the part \nof decision makers, and a high staff turnover with a poor incentive and sanction structure. The \neffect of the capacity development components has been transient.  \n10.  ADB development partners have begun or are planning assistance that will complement \nthis  TA.  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  is  funding  technical \nspecialists in auditing, accounting, and taxation, and has proposed short studies to assess the \nstatus of public enterprises and the management and utilization of the RERF. The New Zealand \nAgency for International Development (NZAID) is supporting the improvement of management \nskills  in  public  enterprises.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  is  assisting  the \nstrengthening  of  aid  coordination  and  management.  The  MFED  wants  to  increase  the \ncoordination  between  the  development  partners  supporting  improved  public  financial \nmanagement. By providing a strong core of assistance to public financial management, the TA \n                                                \n3  The KDP also recognizes the need to stimulate the private sector to create jobs and to promote economic growth. \n4 Government of Kiribati. 2008.

In accordance with ADB\u2019s approach for engagement in fragile situations, the TA will be \ndelivered through a phased approach.7 This will allow an initial diagnostic analysis of capacity \ndevelopment needs to guide the development of the assistance required to help Kiribati move to \nthe use of a medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) and implement public enterprise reform. \nEmploying a phased approach will also allow the setting of clear targets or trigger points that \nshould  be  met  before  proceeding  to  subsequent  phases,  thus  ensuring  that  capacity \ndevelopment is bedded down in each stage. This will allow ADB adapt to changing internal or \nexternal factors. \nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA. Impact and Outcome \n12.  The intended impact of the TA is to improve fiscal performance and reduce the fiscal \ndeficit through the disciplined use of a MTFF and specific steps to control key expenditure items. \nThe outcomes of the TA are expected to be the adoption of the MTFF approach to fiscal \nplanning and the implementation of reforms to improve the management and performance of \npublic enterprises. These outcomes can only be successfully achieved in a phased approach \nthat incorporates sufficient capacity building.  \nB. Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA supports the government strategies set out in the KDP to ensure fiscal prudence \nand refrain from unnecessary overspending, strengthen public financial management through \nlong-term  budget  strategies,  including  multiyear  budgets,  and  improve  and  enhance  the \nefficiency of public enterprises. It comprises three TA subprojects. \n14. Subproject  1: Capacity  development  Diagnostic  Analysis.  This  subproject  will \nsupport a consultative and participatory assessment and analysis of capacity within the public \nenterprise oversight and budget-related units of MFED, as well as the budget-related capacity in \nline ministries. It will be conducted jointly by the consultant and the ministries concerned. The \ncapacity development priorities needed to support subprojects 2 and 3 will be identified and a \ncapacity  development  road  map  to  achieve  them  prepared.  The  road  map  will  explicitly \nrecognize  the  influence  of  political  economy  and  will  consider  the  appropriate  capacity \ndevelopment  modes  based  on  past  experience  in  Kiribati  and  the  Pacific,  including  that \ncontained in the Pacific capacity development case studies undertaken by ADB in 2007. It will \nalso consider innovative options, such as the use of consultants as mentors or the use of local \ntraining institutions. Deepening capacity will also be important. It is expected that the roadmap \nwill identify capacity development needs that are beyond the financial resources of the TA\u2014\nincluding institutional twinning and longer-term training\u2014and additional support will be actively \nsought from development partners. TA funds will focus primarily on building capacity on the job \nwith the direct support of the TA consultants. To enable a complete assessment of capacity \ndevelopment needs, subprojects 2 and 3 will be further designed within subproject 1 and, upon \nADB approval, implemented together.  \n15. Subproject 2: Working Towards a Medium-Term Fiscal Framework. Subproject 2 \ncomprises three sequential components, each with predetermined trigger points to indicate \nwhen a desired level of competence has been achieved and the next component should be \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2007. Achieving Development Effectiveness in Weakly Performing Countries. Manila. ", "4\ninitiated.8 The capacity development needs identified in subproject 1 will be addressed as the \ntechnical aspects of this component are implemented, both directly through the TA and in \nconcert with other development partners. The subproject will \n(i)  strengthen  the  annual  budget  (years  1  through  2)  through  assessment  of  the \nexisting budget process and practices with a view to identifying weaknesses and \nhighlighting opportunities for improving their performance focus, strengthen public \ncash management and commitment control, strengthen macroeconomic and fiscal \nforecasting capacity, and address related legislation;  \n(ii)  implement a multiyear budget framework (years 2 through 3) by building capacity \nin  forecasting,  preparing  related  legislation,  and  building  awareness  and \nunderstanding of the purpose of the framework among stakeholders; and \n(iii)  implement  a  MTFF  (year  4),  further  strengthen  forecasting  capacity,  and \nstrengthen awareness and understanding of the purpose of the MTFF among \nstakeholders.  \n16. Subproject  3: Public  Enterprise  Performance  Improvement.  Subproject  3  will \ndevelop a public enterprise reform strategy and its endorsement will allow for demonstration of \ngovernment commitment to its implementation. This strategy will build on the proposed AusAID \nreview of the status of public enterprises and will also recognize the ongoing role of NZAID in \nimproving  the  performance  of  public  enterprise  managers.  The  TA  will  support  the  initial \nimplementation of this strategy. Priority will be given to piloting actions that can be replicated \nacross public enterprises and trying innovative approaches such as the use of management \ncontracts. The capacity development needs identified in subproject 1 will be addressed as the \ntechnical aspects of this subproject are implemented, both directly through the TA and also in \nconcert with other development partners. This subproject can be expected to have tangible \nimpacts on the fiscal deficit. \n17.  Under the broad methodology for subprojects 2 and 3, consultants will help counterpart \nstaff  implement  the  reforms  included  in  the  initial  detailed  design  in  a  consultative  and \nparticipatory manner through a mix of field and remote support. The capacity development \nefforts designed under subproject 1 will be integral to subprojects 2 and 3. Their success will be \nclosely monitored through predetermined indicators. Consultants will be required to have proven \nexperience in developing capacity. This will ensure that capacity development will be timely and \nfully integrated in the TA and will avoid previous problems that arose when consultants lacked \nthe necessary capacity development skills. To overcome another identified weakness in earlier \nTA  design,  the  implementation  of  subprojects  2  and  3  will  be  supported  by  a  change \nmanagement specialist and a local facilitator who will generate internal and external awareness \nand support. External awareness-raising will be directed to key decision makers as well as to \nthe general public.  \n18.  A  number  of  assumptions  are  important  to  the  success  of  the  TA.  Sustained \nGovernment commitment to public sector reforms will be key, particularly in the implementation \nof  the  MTFF,  the  strengthening  of  cash  management  (which  is  hampering  public  debt \nmanagement), and the carrying out of public enterprise reform. Kiribati\u2019s financial position has \ntightened due to high RERF drawdowns. This and leadership changes in the 2007 elections \nhave created an environment that is conducive to tackling these issues and addressing the \nresulting constraints on growth. The possibilities that counterpart staffs are not provided or key \noperational staffs are not retained are the greatest risks to the TA\u2019s success. A weakening of \npolitical support and reversion to past trends, when political considerations drove short-term \n                                                \n8  Trigger points will be developed in consultation with the Government and specified in the design of component 2 \nthat will be undertaken during under component 1. The trigger points will be subject to ADB approval.  ", "5\nresource allocation, would also place TA outcomes at risk. Government failure to prioritize \nstrengthening of the public sector IT interconnectivity would limit the TA benefits. Continued \nbroad  policy  support  for  private  sector  development  and  public  sector  reform,  including \npersonnel management, is likewise essential. The flexibility provided by the phased approach \nwill allow the TA to adapt to a changing environment.  \nC. Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $880,000. Of this, $800,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. \nThe Government of Kiribati will finance the equivalent of $80,000 in kind through the provision of \ncounterpart  staff,  office  accommodations,  and  local  communication.  Details  of  the  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \nD. Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The MFED will be the executing agency, while implementing agencies will include MFED, \nline ministries such as health and education, and selected public enterprises. Under the MFED, \na TA focal point will be appointed to liaise with the consultant team and oversee its activities. \nThe consultants and the TA focal point will liaise with relevant development partner programs \nand/or projects to promote coordination and complementarity in all activities. As subprojects 2 \nand  3  are  developed,  cofinancing  will  be  sought  to  extend  the  range  of  activities.  Initial \napproaches have been made to potential partners. Consultative and participatory processes will \nbe  used  in  TA  implementation  to  promote  successful  capacity  development  outcomes. \nDisbursement under the TA will be done in line with the Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook.9\n21.  The TA will be implemented intermittently over a 4-year period, starting in November \n2008  and  ending  in  November  2012.  The  first  subproject  ($89,000)  will  be  implemented \nbetween  November  2008  and  March  2009.  The  TA  will  finance  23  person-months  of \ninternational consulting services and 5 person-months of a national consultant. The proposed \nconsultants will all provide services intermittently and will comprise six international consultants: \n(i)  team  leader,  a  public  financial  management  specialist  (9  person-months),  (ii)  treasury \nspecialist (1 person-month), (iii) capacity development specialist (3 person-months), (iv) public \nenterprise  specialist  (7  person-months),  (v)  macroeconomist  (1  person-month),  (vi)  change \nmanagement advisor (2 person-months), and one national consultant, facilitator (5 person-\nmonths). ADB will engage the team of consultants as a firm based on a simplified technical \nproposal under the quality- and cost-based selection process, using an 80:20 weighting for \nquality\u2013cost. The firm will be contracted for all three subprojects to ensure continuity of input \nand a sustained relationship with counterparts. The consultants will be engaged in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nAppendix 3 gives the outline terms of reference. Reporting will comprise an inception, half-\nyearly progress, and draft final and final reports. ADB will support the government in sharing all \nreports with other development partners.  \nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Kiribati for the Economic Management and Public Sector Reform, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2008.

Consultant services will support the three subprojects of this technical assistance (TA). A \nteam  leader,  who  will  be  a  public  financial  management  specialist,  will  be  in  charge  of \nsupervising all subprojects and lead the work on subproject 2. It is expected that consultants will \nwork closely with each other to keep the TA in line with its scope and ensure that each \nsubproject will be coherent. \n2.  The consultants will work as a cohesive team to deliver the tasks below. The TA will be \nimplemented intermittently by a team of six international consultants for 23 person-months and \none national consultant for 5 person-months. The international consultant team will comprise a \npublic financial management specialist/team leader (9 person-months); a treasury specialist (1 \nperson-month);  a  capacity  development  specialist  (3  person-months);  a  public  enterprise \nspecialist (7 person-months); a macroeconomist (1 person-month); and a change management \nadvisor (2 person-months). These will be joined by a local facilitation specialist (national, 5 \nperson-months intermittent). \n1.  Public Financial Management Specialist and Team Leader (international, 9 \nperson-months, intermittent) \n3.  The  public  financial  management  specialist  and  team  leader  will  have  a  strong \nbackground in expenditure management, especially output-based budgeting; capacity building \nand training; and project and/or program development and management.
