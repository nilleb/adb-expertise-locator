INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested policy and advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Mobilizing Pension Fund \nFinancing for Public\u2013Private Partnerships (PPPs). Following a mission in April 2016, ADB and \nthe  government  reached  an  understanding  on  the  objectives,  scope,  implementation \narrangement, costs, and terms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The savings held within the PRC pension funds need to expand to prepare for an aging \npopulation; the proportion of people above the age of 60 was around 12% in 2010 but is \nexpected to reach 34% by 2050.2 Prudent but growth-oriented investment of these savings will \nbe required if they are to provide the elderly with adequate financial resources during their \nretirement. \n \n3.  The PRC\u2019s pension funds have predominantly been invested in treasury bonds and bank \ndeposits. While such assets offer the benefits of low risks, the associated relatively low returns \nconstrain the potential payout from pension funds. Investment in a wider portfolio of assets can \nhelp pension funds balance their portfolios and potentially generate higher returns over time. \nBut  any  portfolio diversification  also  needs to be  prudently managed so  as to  protect  the \ninterests of pension recipients while achieving a high standard of governance.  \n \n4.  The PRC\u2019s expanding PPP program is emerging as an important investment opportunity \nfor the pension funds. PPP activity had largely ceased by 2012, but reforms initiated in 2013 \nhave since seen a large expansion in activity. As of June 2016, the PRC was preparing or \nimplementing 9,285 PPPs across 19 industries, worth around $1.6 trillion in investment.3 These \nprojects are extending the PRC\u2019s PPP model into new areas of the economy, and introducing \nnew approaches to PPPs. \n \n5.  The  international  trend  is  to  prepare  a  PPP  program  so  it  attracts  financing  from \ninstitutional investors, including pension funds. The institutional investors have a long-term \ninvestment profile and can offer finance at a fixed and potentially lower cost than conventional \nbank financing. Accessing their financing normally requires extra effort in structuring PPPs so \nthey provide secure investments. It can, for example, require a repackaging of risk and/or \nreward investment opportunities. Measures that better manage risks, such as partial credit \nguarantees, may be required, and projects may initially have to be financed by banks with a \nview to financing being provided by other investors as they mature. \n \n6.  The involvement of institutional investors in PPPs will be facilitated by a transition toward \nproject finance. The PRC\u2019s PPPs are mainly financed by bank loans issued in the nature of \ncorporate finance. In line with trends observed in other countries, it is likely that the current \nemphasis on corporate finance will become less attractive as the PPP program progresses, and \nthat project finance will become more established. The engagement of pension funds can be \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 July 2016. \n2  International Monetary Fund. 2015.

Pension fund reforms in the PRC, and the concurrent expansion of the PPP program, \nare creating opportunities for pension funds to better engage in PPPs. Numerous government \nannouncements have encouraged pension funds to participate in projects and the PPP funds \nbeing established to provide equity and debt financing. Notably, in mid-2015, the State Council \nallowed pension funds to further diversify their portfolios to improve returns. Pension funds were \nencouraged to develop methods of financing PPPs, such as loans, equity investments, and \nproject asset-backed investment plans, based on market principles. Up to 30% of assets can \nnow be invested in stocks, investment-linked insurance products, and equity funds. Permitted \ninvestments include bonds, asset-backed securities, index futures, bond futures, and major \ninfrastructure projects. \n \n8.  Various pension funds support the formal enterprise sector and non-salaried workers in \nurban and rural areas. The single largest fund is the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), \nwhich at the end of 2015 held CNY1.9 trillion in assets to pay for pensions and other forms of \nsocial security. NSSF participated in the CNY180 billion PPP fund established by the Ministry of \nFinance  with  banks  and  other  institutional  investors  in  September  2015  to  provide  equity \nfinancing. Pension funds are also managed by local governments and there are some funds \ncovering the private sector, such as an enterprise annuity system, and individual voluntary plans.  \n \n9.  Capitalizing  on  the  opportunities  that  have  emerged  for  financing  by  institutional \ninvestors, including pension funds, is important to ensuring sustainable financing of the PRC\u2019s \nPPP program. Capitalizing on the opportunities can also make an important contribution to \nstrengthening the financial position of pension funds, so long as the risk of capital erosion for \npensioners (current and future) is managed well and good governance standards are preserved. \nDoing so will require a prudent approach based on balancing the objectives of both the PPP \nprogram and the essential requirement that the pension system protect pensioners against risk. \n \n10.  The country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC positions ADB to continue \nplaying a catalytic role in the PRC\u2019s development process through an enhanced operational \nfocus on innovation and value addition, and a further shift toward generating knowledge, sharing \nbest  practices,  and  building  capacity.4 The  country  partnership  strategy  will  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to strengthen the policy, legal, fiduciary, and regulatory frameworks and \npractices to improve the delivery and management of infrastructure and public services. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The project is aligned with the decision of the State Council to develop innovative, \nmarket-based financing channels for PPPs. The outcome will be pension fund participation in \nPPP financing promoted. Performance will be assessed by the submission to the central and \nlocal governments, regulators, and major pension funds of the action plan on enhancing the role \nof pension funds in PPP financing. \n \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2016.

The TA will help prepare the PRC\u2019s pension funds for financing PPPs, and equip the \nPRC\u2019s PPPs to access pension fund financing. It will have both a national and provincial scope, \nwith Sichuan province providing a case study of provincial conditions and practices. Knowledge \nproducts will be prepared to share the findings with national agencies and local governments. \nThe impact and outcome of the TA will be achieved through the following outputs and activities. \n \n13.  Output 1: Pension funds in public\u2013private partnership financing in other countries \nassessed. This will draw out the implications for the PRC of practices in other countries based \non a desk study and a study tour of countries demonstrating good practices. The output will \nidentify the different ways in which pension funds have engaged in PPPs, the preconditions for \nsuccessful financing of PPPs by institutional investors such as pension funds, the implications of \ndifferent pension fund structures and types (e.g., defined benefits versus defined contribution \nfunds), and the impacts on both the PPP programs and the development of the finance sector. \nMaximum use will be made of earlier studies that examined how to protect the long-term \ninterests of pension funds while facilitating their investment in PPPs. These studies highlighted \nthe importance of ensuring policy and regulatory frameworks for long-term investment, and a \ntransparent  investment  environment.5 The  regulatory  and  governance  framework  in  which \npension funds have operated and, in particular, the regulatory controls and other formal checks \nand balances on the actions of pension fund managers, will also be explored. \n \n14.  Output 2: Suggestions on improving the role of pension funds in public\u2013private \npartnership financing prepared. While the national and local government-managed pension \nfunds  have  recently  been  provided  more  flexibility  to  engage  in  PPPs,  improvements  to \ninvestment  and  asset management  practices are  still  needed. The  opportunity to  increase \npotential returns needs to be matched with prudent management of their assets and risk profile \nto ensure financial sustainability and good governance. \n \n15.  Drawing on the findings of output 1, reviews will be conducted on the readiness of the \nNSSF and local government pension funds to diversify their portfolios to include investment in \nPPPs. This will encompass information management systems and disclosure, the regulatory \nand governance framework, pension fund management standards, and investment guidelines \nand  strategies  (e.g.,  on  risk\u2013return  profiles).  Asset  allocation  decisions,  performance \nassessment, and risk management techniques will be examined. The compliance of financing a \nbroader portfolio of assets, including PPPs, with the fiduciary responsibilities of pension funds \nwill be considered. The impact of recent regulatory reforms and any barriers that have become \napparent during their implementation will be examined. Challenges specific to financing PPPs, \nsuch as those arising from key provisions in PPP agreements (e.g., termination clauses and \nstep-in rights) and the need to understand infrastructure, will be given close attention. \n \n16.  Given the large number of local government pension funds across the PRC, it will not be \npossible to examine all and Sichuan\u2019s funds will act as a case study of practices at the local \ngovernment level.6 The output will include preparation of a stocktake of the NSSF and Sichuan\u2019s \npension  funds  (covering,  for  example,  their  structure,  governance  arrangements,  financial \nposition, and operations). \n                                                \n5  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 2011.

The output will examine the response by pension funds to recent directions from the \nState Council on PPP financing, such as to make more use of project bonds and asset-backed \nsecurities. Close attention will also be paid to directions given to finance regulatory departments \nto strengthen regulation, and to guide financial institutions to correctly identify, calculate, and \ncontrol risks according to the principles of risk under control and commercial sustainability. \n18.  The  output  will  examine  the  suitability  of  PPPs  to  access  pension  fund  financing, \ndrawing on the findings from output 1 on how other countries have prepared PPPs so they can \naccess institutional investors. Observations will be prepared based on nationwide developments \nin  the  PPP  operational  framework  supported  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission, and other central agencies. \n \n19.  To ensure a practical focus, the output will also conduct case studies of individual PPP \nprojects. The output will present at least four case studies from Sichuan\u2019s PPPs program. The \ncase studies will look at the financing sources of these PPPs, the participation of institutional \ninvestors such as pension funds, and test whether efforts are being made to ensure PPPs are \nattractive assets for pension funds. These studies will, for example, examine if the PPPs were \nsuited to project financing by providing adequate protection for lenders, for example. Insights \nfrom other PRC provinces preparing similar PPPs, and data in the Integrated PPP Information \nPlatform of the China PPP Center, will also be utilized. Drawing on the experience of other \ncountries, each case study will offer suggestions on how to improve the readiness of PPPs for \nfinancing from pension funds.  \n \n20.  Output 3. Action plan for enhancing the role of pension funds in public\u2013private \npartnership financing prepared. The findings of the TA will be encapsulated in an action plan \nfor improving the readiness of pension funds to invest in PPPs, and for improving the readiness \nof PPPs to access pension fund financing. Close attention will be paid to the views of the \nregulators and administrators of pension funds in preparing the action plan, and lessons from \nthe experience of other countries. \n \n21.  In order to enhance the outreach of the findings, the TA will support awareness-raising \nand capacity development events. This will include a national-level workshop to develop and \npresent the proposed action plan, which will involve participants from key central government \nagencies. Maximum use will be made of ADB assistance and other development partners so as \nto add value to earlier work, and to avoid duplication. Key materials prepared by the TA will be \nreleased for wider use via ADB\u2019s and other websites. \n \n22.  Risks include (i) support for policy and regulatory reforms needed to improve the role of \npension funds in PPPs cannot be secured from relevant government agencies or regulators; (ii) \nrestrictions on access to pension funds and project information hinder the conduct of detailed \nanalysis; and (iii) weak capacity in local government agencies or other work commitments \nhinder their effective participation in the conduct of assessments and other TA activities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n23.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of office space, assistance in arranging meetings with \ncounterpart agencies, counterpart staff and other services to the consultants, and other in-kind \ncontributions. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n24.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months, from 1 October 2016 to 31 September \n2019. The Sichuan Finance Department will be the executing agency and provide high level \nguidance  to  the  TA,  while  the  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  Research  Institute  of  China  in \nSouthwest Jiaotong University will be the implementing agency and lead on operational matters. \nThe consultants\u2019 detailed work plan will be updated and agreed by the implementing agency \nand ADB as the team is mobilized. \n \n25.  The TA will be implemented in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance\u2019s China PPP \nCenter, and the National Council for Social Security, which is responsible for the NSSF. The \nimplementing  agency  will  coordinate  with  these  and  other  government  agencies  and \nstakeholders. The implementing agency will take overall responsibility for seminars, workshops, \nthe international study tour, and the day-to-day work of the consultants. \n \n26.  International advisors (an institutional investment advisor and a PPP advisor) will provide \n3 person-months of input. National consultants (an institutional investment advisor and team \nleader,  a  PPP  specialist,  financial  specialist,  pension  fund  specialist,  and  coordinator)  will \nprovide  30  person-months  of  inputs.  Considering  the  nature  of  the  assignment  and  the \navailability of the required expertise, the national consultants will be engaged through a firm \nusing the fixed budget selection and biodata technical proposal.7 The international consultants \nwill be engaged on an individual basis. As TA implementation will make extensive use of \nparticipatory workshops, and a wide range of skills and experience will be required, provision is \nalso made for resource persons. The outline terms of reference is in Appendix 3.8 \n \n27.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs following the agreed timeline and budget. To support monitoring \nand evaluation, consultants will submit an inception report, a midterm report, a draft final report, \nand a final report to the executing agency and ADB. The main mechanism to monitor and \nassess the TA will be TA review missions. The knowledge products created by the TA will be \ndisseminated by the executing agency and ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n28.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Mobilizing Pension Fund Financing for \nPublic\u2013Private Partnerships, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n7  This recruitment method is justified as a precise definition of the terms of reference for the studies is possible, and \nchanges to the terms of reference are not expected during implementation. The recruitment method is also justified \nbecause the budget available for the studies is fixed ($165,000 for fees and per diem plus expenses of up to \n$65,000) and cannot be exceeded, and the time and personnel inputs can be accurately assessed. If no suitable \nfirm can provide the required consultants in a timely manner, the national consultants may be hired individually, \nsubject to the appropriate ADB approval process. \n8  ADB will engage the international and national consultants, as well as any resource persons, following its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed following the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nConsultants and resource persons will be engaged on a fixed-price and/or lump-sum basis wherever feasible. \n ", "6     Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImp  act the TA is Aligned with \nInnovative market-based financing channels for PPPs developed (State Council Notice on the Promotion of PPP in \nthe Delivery of Public Services)a \nPerformance Indicators with Targets and  Data Sources \nResults Chain  Baselines  and Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nPension fund  Submission to the central and local  Website data,  Support for policy and \nparticipation in  governments, regulators, and major pension  social media,  regulatory reforms \nPPP financing  funds of the action plan on enhancing the role  media  needed to improve the \npromoted  of pension funds in PPP financing (by 2020;  announcements  role of pension funds \nbaseline: NA)  (daily)b  in PPPs cannot be \nsecured from relevant \ngovernment agencies \nor regulators. \nOutputs       \n1.
