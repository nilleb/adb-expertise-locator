INTRODUCTION\n1. During the 2000 country programming mission for the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic\n(Lao PDR), the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) agreed that ADB would\nassist  the  Government  in  preparing  the  roads  for  rural  development  project,1  which  is\nprogrammed for 2002/2003 in the 2001 Lao PDR country strategy and program (CSP). The\nfeasibility study was completed in 1999.2 However, it was recognized that the investment and\npolicy packages for the ensuing project would require more detailed analysis of specific areas in\naccordance with priorities agreed in the CSP. The Fact-Finding Mission was fielded during 4-13\nSeptember  2001  to  discuss  with  the  Government  the  objectives,  scope,  cost  estimates,\nfinancing plan, terms of reference for consulting services, and implementation arrangements for\nthe technical assistance (TA).3\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Lao PDR has a rich and varied natural resource base and is a center of economic\ncorridors  linking  subregional  economies.  However,  mountainous  geography,  remote\nsettlements, and low population density are barriers to access and the cost-efficient delivery of\npublic services. Despite remarkable economic growth and reduction in poverty in the Lao PDR\nwithin the last decade, widespread poverty is still the most pressing problem: more than 38\npercent of the population, or about 1.9 million people, live below the poverty line. Significant\ndisparity has been identified in the incidence of poverty across regions as well as between\nurban and rural areas. The northern region has the highest ratio, with Houaphan as the poorest\nprovince. On average, economic growth benefited the urban areas more than the rural areas.\n3. In June 2001, ADB and the Government agreed on the CSP and partnership agreement\nto guide ADB support to Lao PDR over the next five years in accordance with the overarching\nobjective  of  poverty  reduction.  The  CSP  was  approved  on  18  September  2001,  and  the\npartnership agreement was signed in Vientiane on 28 September 2001. It was agreed that\n\"Poverty Reduction through Broadening Community Participation and Opportunities\" would be\nthe theme of ADB's interventions in the Lao PDR over the next five years.4 Core strategies are\n(i) sustainable economic growth, (ii) inclusive social development, and (iii) good governance\nthrough policy and institutional development. To realize the strategic goals, ADB will focus on (i)\nrural  development  and  market  linkages,  (ii)  human  resource  development,  (iii)  sustainable\nenvironmental management, and (iv) private sector development and regional integration, as\nthe main operational priorities for the CSP. Results of the participatory poverty assessment\nhighlight the need to improve rural infrastructure and the importance of increasing market\naccess in rural areas. Given that the poor are concentrated in rural areas and that agriculture\nprovides  income  for  most  people,  rural  development  is  critical  to  achieving  sustainable\neconomic growth and poverty reduction. The next ADB involvement will focus in the northern\npart of the country, its poorest region. A project preparatory TA for northern region roads is\nprogrammed for 2003 with an ensuing project programmed for 2004.\n                                                          \n1 To better reflect the scope of the project, it was agreed to change the title of the project from Second Rural Access\nRoads to Roads for Rural Development.\n2 TA 2889-LAO: Rural Access Roads Improvement Project, for $600,000, approved on 6 October 1997, from which\nfour road sections have been implemented through Loan 1795-LAO: Rural Access Roads Project, for $25.0 million,\napproved on 7 December 2000.\n3 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 20 July 2001.\n4 Country Strategy and Program, Asian Development Bank, September 2001.", "2\n4. ADB involvement in the transport sector in the Lao PDR started in 1979 when the\ndeteriorated  road  infrastructure  was  recognized  as  a  serious  constraint  to  economic\ndevelopment  and  physical  integration  of  the  country.  Since  then,  ADB  has  been  actively\ninvolved in the transport sector through its loan and TA program, which has resulted in the\nrehabilitation and improvement of significant sections of the main arterial road network, capacity\nbuilding of institutions, and policy reforms in the sector. The development impact of the previous\nprojects has been significant, with a visibly enhanced degree of commercial and agricultural\ndevelopment in the project areas. Once the main transport network is approaching completion,\na transport network for rural development will be needed to ensure that social and economic\nbenefits from the main network improvements are maximized and that impacts benefit the rural\npopulation. Poverty reduction through economic growth and improved access to the poor is the\ntheme of ADB's interventions in the transport sector. Efficient transport and improved access in\nparticular is one of the keys to economic development and poverty reduction.5 The current and\nnext phases of ADB's sector strategy is to assist with the development of a transport network to\ncomplement the planned program of the Government in rural development.\n5. The Government's report to the 7th roundtable meeting in November 2000 focused on\nthe Government's strategic approach to poverty alleviation. Its strategic coherence has been\nestablished by identifying the main sectors (agriculture and forestry, education, health, and road\ninfrastructure), which at this point in time will contribute most decisively to poverty reduction.\nWhile development and improvement in all sectors of the economy are needed to achieve\nsustainable  long-term  development,  these  four  sectors  represent  the  backbone  of  the\nGovernment's  approach  to  immediate  poverty  reduction  and  response  to  the  population\nexpectations as well. A major effort was undertaken to establish a national long-term strategic\nvision for these sectors, and has been the subject of policy dialogue with the external funding\nagency community.\n6. The Government, supported by ADB and in extensive consultation with other external\nfunding agencies, prepared a paper, Strategic Directions for the Development of the Road\nSector  (2001-2015),6  which  provides  a  sector-wide  framework  for  future  road  sector\ndevelopment. The Government and ADB agree that if the objectives of the strategy are to be\nachieved, a time-bound realistic and achievable medium-term implementation plan must be\nprepared. ADB also assisted the Government in preparing a medium-term road investment plan\nthat is well accepted by the external financing agency community.7 Furthermore, the World\nBank, in collaboration with ADB, the Nordic Development Fund, and Sweden, assisted the\nGovernment in preparing a road maintenance program that develops sustainable mechanisms\nfor  maintaining  the  existing  roads,  and  a  road  maintenance  fund  has  been  established.  8\nHowever, interim support will still be necessary until the fund is fully operational and self-\nsufficient.\n7. ADB has provided significant advisory assistance, particularly within the Department of\nRoads,  in  management  information  systems,  commercialization  and  privatization  of  road\nconstruction enterprises and transport operations, increased transparency through the use of\nlocal  competitive  bidding  procedures  for  road  construction  and  maintenance,  project\n                                                          \n5 TA 5947-REG: Assessing the Impact of Transport and Energy Infrastructure on Poverty Reduction, for 800,000,\napproved on 25 October 2000.\n6 Lao PDR. June 2000. Strategic Directions for the Development of the Road Sector. Vientiane.\n7 Under TA 3070-LAO: Road Infrastructure for Rural Development, for $720,000, approved on 17 September 1998.\n8  Under the World Bank's Road Maintenance Project, for $25 million, approved on 31 January 2001, including\nmechanisms  financing,  accounting,  revenue  collection,  control,  financial  reporting  and  audit  of  the  road\nmaintenance fund.", "3\ncoordination and contract management, and road network planning. Other external agencies\nhave also provided valuable assistance, particularly in road network planning, maintenance\nprogramming,  and  financial  management.  Considerable  progress  has  been  made  in\nstrengthening the Ministry of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction (MCTPC) and\nits units, and a decentralization policy was introduced in 1996 to delegate more responsibility to\nits provincial units (departments of communication, transport, post and construction [DCTPCs]).\nHowever,  staff  and  organizational  limitations  still  need  to  be  improved  to  enable  them  to\nproperly fulfill their designated role.\n8. The  Government  appreciates  that  transport  sector  performance  can  be  improved\nthrough private sector participation. Efficiency in the land transport sector should be increased\nby promoting public-private sector participation and competition in transport infrastructure and\nservices  provision.  The  commercial  passenger  and  freight  transport  industry  is  currently\noperating in a competitive market, but the remaining controls on route competition and fares and\nrates need to be reexamined to test their continuing relevance. There is also a need to ensure\nthat  the  industry  adheres  to  regulations  introduced  to  protect  road  assets,  to  minimize\ninconvenience to other road users, for operator and public safety, and to assure that good\nbusiness practices are observed. Introducing the industry with legal, accounting, and audit\nrequirements will assist operators to improve their services and to lower costs. Affordable and\nuser-friendly  transport  services  should  be  available  to  the  poor.  Development  of  the  local\ncontracting industry is still a pressing need. Despite the commercialization initiated in the 1990s,\nthe industry is weak in human resources and access to financial resources and equipment.\nWhile a more stable flow of works is expected from the road maintenance program and some\nroad improvement works, available and affordable equipment will be required. Joint ventures of\nlocal and international contractors need to be encouraged to promote transfer of the knowledge\nof management techniques from the international to the domestic contractors.\n9. As part of the feasibility study for the rural access roads improvement project, from\nwhich four roads have been taken up under Loan 1795 (footnote 2), economic, environment,\nand social analyses were prepared. The remaining roads are to be implemented under the\nensuing project. An additional study will be required to further review and, to the extent possible,\nquantify the development benefits, the distribution of benefits, and impacts on poverty reduction\nin the project area of influence that will result from improved transport access. This emerging\nstudy was not part of the scope of the original feasibility study, which focused more on a\ntraditional vehicle operating cost savings approach to project viability, which also should be\nreviewed. Furthermore, in line with the theme of ADB's interventions in the Lao PDR over the\nnext five years, village consultation and community participation to identify community needs\nand potential economic development is necessary to maximizing economic benefits from road\ndevelopment.\n10.  Consistent with the Government's strategy and ADB's CSP, the envisaged project will\nhelp to (i) reduce rural poverty in remote villages, including those of ethnic minorities, by\nincreasing economic opportunities and improving the quality of life in rural communities; and (ii)\nimprove the efficiency of road network management and maintenance.", "4\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n11. Efficient transport and improved access in particular is one of the keys to economic\ndevelopment and poverty reduction. Investment in roads is part of a continuing program to\nsupport the development of an integrated and balanced road network in the country. The\nobjectives of the TA are to assist the Government in formulating the next steps for implementing\nthe  road  sector  strategy  to  develop  an  efficient  road  transport  system,  and  to  design  the\nenvisaged roads for rural development project. The ensuing project will aim to provide the rural\npoor with access to markets, employment opportunities, and social facilities contributing to\neconomic growth and poverty reduction.\nB.  Scope\n12. The  scope  of  the  TA  consists  of  (i)  formulation  of  a  medium-term  action  plan  to\nimplement  the  strategic  directions  for  road  sector  development;  (ii)  a  capacity  building\ncomponent to assist Government officials, local contractors, and service operators; and (iii) the\ndesign of an investment component for the ensuing project.\n13. The TA will prepare a pragmatic and achievable action plan that includes establishment\nof performance indicator benchmarks and monitoring system. The TA will assess the capacity of\nlocal contractors, service providers, and the DCTPCs of Attapeu, Borikhamxai, and Sayaburi.\nBased on this assessment, the major issues and strategic options and priorities to improve their\ncapacities will be formulated. The TA will update the feasibility study of Xaisetha-Sanxai (54\nkm), Pakxan-Thasi (79 km), and Sayaburi-Hongsa (90 km), and conduct additional feasibility\nstudy for Xiengman-Muang Ngeun (170 km), Kouang Xi access road (30 km), and Pakton-Ban\nVang (43 km). These roads (see the Map) are included in the medium-term road investment\nplan. Further prioritization, including assurance that 12 percent economic internal rate of return\ncutoff point is warranted, will be needed in anticipation of the programmed loan amount and\npossible cofinancing. The TA will also conduct a benefit distribution analysis and estimate the\npoverty impact ratio. District economic potential and community needs within the project areas\nwill be identified using a participatory approach to formulate a poverty intervention component.9\nA series of workshops will be conducted as necessary.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n14. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $480,000 equivalent, comprising $329,000 in\nforeign  exchange  cost,  and  $151,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide\n$400,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $71,000 equivalent of the\nlocal currency cost, on a grant basis, to be financed from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the\nGovernment of Japan. The Government will finance the remaining $80,000 equivalent in local\ncurrency, covering counterpart staff and related salaries, provision of government vehicles,\noffice  accommodation,  and  related  services  and  facilities.  Detailed  cost  estimates  and  the\nfinancing plan are in Appendix 1. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA\ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.\n                                                          \n9  Including a possible proposal to be financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction.", "5\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n15. The TA will be implemented over four months, commencing on 15 February 2002 and\nfinishing on 14 June 2002. A multidisciplinary team of consultants will be required to provide a\ntotal input of 13 person-months of international and 25 person-months of domestic consultants.\nThe international consultants will have expertise in (i) transport policy analysis, institutional\ncapacity building, and private sector development; (ii) transport economic and poverty impact\nanalysis; (iii) road engineering; (iv) environmental impact analysis; and (v) resettlement and\nsocial development. The domestic consultants will have expertise in public administration, road\nand traffic engineering, road safety, sociology, environment, and community organization and\nparticipation. A firm of international consultants, in association with domestic consultants will be\nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other\narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The\ninternational consulting firm will be responsible to ADB for the overall scope of work. The outline\nterms of reference for the consultants are attached as Appendix 2. The simplified technical\nproposal procedure will be used.\n16. The  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  will  be  MCTPC,  which  will  establish  a  TA\nimplementation unit to coordinate TA implementation with concerned line ministries, agencies,\nand external funding agencies. MCTPC will appoint a full-time TA project manager to guide the\nimplementation of the TA and supervise counterpart staff. MCTPC will provide suitable office\naccommodation; office support staff; and the required equipment including vehicles, personal\ncomputers, and facsimile machines. The Government will also provide assistance with surveys,\nworkshops, and other participatory exercises. A TA counterpart team, headed by the project\nmanager, will be established and comprise a minimum of three full-time counterpart staff with\nthe following technical expertise: road and transport planning and policy, public administration,\nand training.\n17.
