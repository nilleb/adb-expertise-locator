INTRODUCTION \n1.  Strategy 2020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) recognizes the need for Asia and \nthe Pacific to pursue \u201copen regionalism,\u201d keeping trade and investment links open with the rest \nof the world.1 ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 also aims to increase regional cooperation and integration \n(RCI) in all operational areas, and increase assistance for RCI to at least 30% of total activities \nby 2020. In view of the developments in the regional economic landscape,2 the ADB Midterm \nReview of Strategy 2020 highlighted the need for a \"second generation RCI\" agenda and \nreiterated the 30% target.3  In order to translate the midterm review agenda for RCI into future \nRCI operations, ADB decided to develop an RCI Operational Plan.4  \n \n2.  This technical assistance (TA) will support the implementation of the midterm review\u2019s \nrecommendations under a proposed RCI Operational Plan by producing operationally-relevant \nknowledge work to guide ADB\u2019s future operations in RCI. The TA will build on the success of \npast ADB flagship publications on RCI and various subregional ADB programs.5 The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Regionalism in Asia and the Pacific is market-driven, dynamic, open, multitrack, and \nmultispeed, owing to different development patterns, economic circumstances, and geopolitical \nrealities across the region. This model of regionalism has served the region well, with RCI \nplaying an increasingly important role in the region\u2019s economic development. \n \n4.  ADB  has  sought  to  take  the  process  of  regionalism  forward  through  a  bottom-up \napproach built on support to subregional cooperation efforts (e.g., the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations [ASEAN], ASEAN+37; the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation; the \nGreater Mekong Subregion; and the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation), with a \nfocus on cross-border infrastructure and related software (Pillar 1), trade and investment (Pillar \n2), monetary and financial cooperation (Pillar 3), and regional public goods (Pillar 4). These \nsubregional cooperation efforts have progressed at different speeds and serve as building \nblocks for an eventual broader and more unified regional architecture. \n \n5.   Recent analyses by ADB have revealed that significant progress has been made in \nharnessing RCI for development.8 Stronger intra-regional linkages in trade, investment, financial \nassets, and labor flows have helped Asia and the Pacific weather heightened volatility and \nweaker global demand in the wake of the 2008/2009 global financial crisis. In particular, intra-\nregional trade remained robust at 55% of total trade in 2014, while intra-regional foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI) comprised 51% of total FDI in 2012, despite the general slowdown in global \ntrade and FDI. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008.

Asian Economic Integration Monitor. Manila (3 years: 2012\u20132014).  \n ", "2  \n6.  There are three opportunities for RCI to address broader development issues in the \nregion. \n \n(i)  Asia and the Pacific is home to approximately two-thirds of the world\u2019s poor, and \nthe  region\u2019s  future  will  be  challenged  by  slowing  productivity  growth,  weak \ncompetitiveness,  and  growing  inequalities  and  vulnerabilities.  These  are \nstructural  reform  issues  that  require  RCI  policies  that  complement  domestic \npolicy reform. \n(ii)  While East and Southeast Asia have benefited from trade and FDI-driven growth \nfrom  the  spread  of  production  networks,  other  subregions  are  much  less \nintegrated. Countries in the Pacific, in particular, face daunting challenges in \naccessing external markets due to their market size and distance from major \nmarkets\u2014physical  obstacles  that  are  often  exacerbated  by  supply-side \nconstraints  such  as  poor  infrastructure  and  weak  productive  capacities.  The \nopportunities for faster growth of trade and investment between subregions also \nneed to be garnered for other parts of the region beyond East and Southeast \nAsia.   \n(iii)  There  is  a  need  to  address  issues  that  naturally  transcend  borders  and \nsubregions, such as climate change, disaster risk management and associated \ninstitutional coordination, as well as challenges that have resulted from increased \nintegration, such as human trafficking and the spread of communicable diseases. \nAddressing these issues will not only require greater investments in regional \npublic  goods,  but  also  more  emphasis  on  mainstreaming  social  and \nenvironmental  interventions  in  the  design  of  RCI  initiatives  in    cross-border \ninfrastructure, trade, and investment. \n \n7.  The development issues outlined above call for a better execution of ADB\u2019s RCI Strategy. \nADB\u2019s RCI operations have thus far focused on improving connectivity under Pillar 1, but the \nevolving  development  landscape  clearly  suggests  the  importance  of  seeking  greater \ncomplementarities across the four pillars of the RCI Strategy. In this light, the midterm review \nhighlighted the need for a \u201csecond generation RCI\u201d agenda that will build on the connectivity \nbetween economies and markets, to seek to promote competiveness in connected markets, and \naddress shared resilience and vulnerability issues.9 In addition, the changes in the development \npartner  landscape  in  RCI,  with  new  region-wide  RCI  initiatives  (e.g.,  the  Regional \nComprehensive Economic Partnership, Trans Pacific Partnership, Eurasian Economic Union, \nOne Belt One Road Initiative of the People\u2019s Republic of China [PRC], Japan's High Quality \nInfrastructure Initiative, the Republic of Korea's Eurasia Initiative, and India's Act East Policy, \namong others) require a stronger understanding of those initiatives and how to forge effective \ncollaboration around institutional arrangements.  \n \n8.  The  outputs  of  this  TA  will  support  the  implementation  of  the  midterm  review\u2019s \nrecommendations  by  producing  operationally  relevant  knowledge  work  that  will  help  guide \nADB\u2019s future operations in RCI.  \n \n                                                \n9 Figure 2 in the Management approved RCI Operational Plan concept paper (approved August 2015) shows the \ndistinction between first and second generation RCI.  \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  impact  will  be  the  implementation  of  RCI  initiatives  that  will  help  address  the \nemerging  development  challenges  faced  by  ADB\u2019s  DMCs. 10  The  outcome  will  be  the \nidentification of new and/or enhanced RCI initiatives that can be incorporated in ADB\u2019s future \noperations in RCI. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA\u2019s three key outputs are as follows:   \n \n11.  Output  1  :  Preparation  of  knowledge  products  on  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration.  These  will examine broad RCI issues reflecting the four pillars of ADB\u2019s RCI \nStrategy and help operationalize the \u201csecond-generation RCI\u201d agenda called for under the \nStrategy  2020  midterm  review.  To  be  developed  in  close  collaboration  with  ADB  regional \ndepartments, the TA will produce two major RCI knowledge products: \n \n(i)  A  background  paper  on  regionalism  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific:  emerging \ntrends, opportunities, and challenges. This study will analyze how RCI can \naddress  emerging  development  challenges  in  the  region,  including  slowing \nproductivity  growth,  weak  competitiveness,  and  growing  inequalities  and \nvulnerabilities; determine the prospects for expanding RCI beyond subregions; \nand explore the implications of emerging drivers of inter-subregional and inter-\nregional integration, such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, \nTrans Pacific Partnership, Eurasian Economic Union, PRC\u2019s One Belt One Road \nInitiative, Japan's High Quality Infrastructure Initiative, the Republic of Korea's \nEurasia Initiative, and India's Act East Policy, among others. \n(ii)  A  thematic  paper  on  economic  clusters  and  economic  corridor \ndevelopment.  Using  three  country  case  studies,  this  paper  will  (i)  examine \napproaches and concepts for economic cluster and corridor development; (ii) \nexplore  the  economic  and  development  impacts  of  economic  clusters  and \ncorridors  and  their  role  in  facilitating  regional  supply  chains  and  production \nnetworks; (iii) identify the factors that contribute to the success and/or failure of \neconomic clusters and corridors; and (iv) identify policy reforms, and spatial \nplanning of multisector interventions and urbanization needed to support the \ndevelopment  of  economic  clusters  and  corridors.  Given  the  interest  and \nengagement of several regional departments in economic corridor development, \nthis is designed to provide an overall analytical framework for economic corridors \nacross subregions, which can be appropriately tailored, and identify potential \ncomplementarities between subregional corridors. \n \n12.  Each background and thematic paper will undertake a literature review to utilize and \nmaximize ADB\u2019s existing knowledge base and identify the research gaps to be filled by the TA.  \nThe literature review will also (i) reflect the findings of the Independent Evaluation Department\u2019s \nassessment of ADB\u2019s RCI Strategy implementation; and (ii) consider the results of the RCI \nRoundtable Conference held in 2014, which dealt with the narrower topic of RCI\u2019s role in \naddressing productivity challenges in Asia.    \n                                                \n10 See paragraph 6, items (i) to (iii) for the list of emerging challenges. \n ", "4  \n \n13.  The TA will undertake consultations with government officials from selected DMCs, \nsubregional forums, ADB staff, and international and local experts to validate the research \nproducts\u2019 scope, findings, and recommendations. For the thematic paper on economic clusters \nand corridors, the TA will also conduct consultations in selected DMCs with major economic \ncross-border areas. \n \n14.  Output 2 : Publication and launch of consolidated research report at the second \nRegional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Roundtable  Conference.  The  key  findings  and \nrecommendations of the two knowledge products will be consolidated into one research report \nthat will be launched at the second RCI Roundtable Conference in November 2016.   \n \n15.  Output 3 : Synthesis paper summarizing the implications for ADB\u2019s operations in \nRegional Cooperation and Integration. In order to help define ADB\u2019s future work on RCI, a \nsynthesis paper will be prepared to (i) explore the programmatic implications of the research \nfindings and policy recommendations; (ii) identify new and/or enhanced RCI initiatives and \ninterventions  that  can  be  incorporated  in  ADB\u2019s  RCI  operations;  and  (iii)  determine  any \nnecessary improvements in ADB\u2019s institutional arrangements for RCI operations. This synthesis \npaper will be reviewed at the second Roundtable RCI Conference in November 2016 and \npresented at subsequent appropriate subregional and/or regional meetings and events. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $850,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The detailed cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months from December 2015 to December 2016. \nADB will be the executing agency. The Regional Cooperation and Integration Thematic Group \n(RCI-TG) Secretariat of the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department will \nserve as the overall coordinator and will be responsible for administering the TA, providing \noverall research guidance, and engaging in collaborative research with consultants. While the \nRCI-TG  Secretariat  will  implement  the  TA,  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments,  Private  Sector \nOperations Department, and Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department will \nprovide substantial guidance and inputs in the production of knowledge work that is critically \nimportant to their respective subregions and operations. The RCI-TG Secretariat will gather \ninputs and comments from these departments through the RCI-TG and the different thematic \nand sector groups within ADB.11 In particular, these departments will be invited to (i) attend the \nfirst internal consultation workshop to present the results of the literature review and discuss the \ncontent of the publication to be produced under this TA; (ii) provide comments on the scope, \nmethodology, and preliminary drafts of the background and thematic papers; and (iii) provide \ninputs to the synthesis paper exploring the implications of the research findings on ADB\u2019s RCI \noperations. The RCI-TG Secretariat will explore subregional programs\u2019 forums and/or meetings \nthat can serve as venues for subregional consultations. \n \n18.  ADB will also coordinate with other global and regional institutions (e.g., the United \nNations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the World Bank, World \n                                                \n11 For more details, see http://www.adb.org/about/knowledge-management/sector-thematic-groups-adb.  \n ", "  5\nCustoms  Organization,  World  Trade  Organization,  and  the  Deutsche Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr \nInternationale Zusammenarbeit) to explore partnerships in producing the knowledge work and \nconduct of other activities under this TA. \n \n19.  The TA will require approximately 29 person-months of international consulting services \n(22 person-months for preparing the background and thematic papers, 6 person-months for \npreparing the synthesis paper, and one person-month for editorial services), 30 person-months \nof national consulting services, and 4.1 person-months of resource persons. All consultants will \nbe selected and engaged individually by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). For this TA, hiring a team of individual \nconsultants will provide more benefits for ADB than engaging a firm because of the following \nreasons: (i) faster mobilization of consultants, (ii) greater control by ADB staff in selecting and \nmanaging individual consultants, and (iii) greater flexibility in engaging experts specializing in a \nbroad spectrum of RCI-related topics.12  \n \n20.  Eleven international consultants will be engaged to prepare the background, thematic, \nand synthesis papers. The consultants are expected to provide the in-depth knowledge and \nexpertise  necessary  to  supplement  ADB\u2019s  nascent  knowledge  base  and  skills  on  second-\ngeneration  RCI.  An  economics  editor  will  also  be  engaged  to  help  review  and  edit  the \nknowledge products that will be produced under this TA. Six resource persons will be invited \neither to present or write background papers for regional workshops, or to serve as peer \nreviewers for the knowledge products that will be produced under this TA. \n \n21.  The  TA  will  require  five  national  consultants:  one  to  assist  in  supervising  and \ncoordinating the TA activities and outputs, and four to provide research support. A typesetter will \nbe sourced from ADB\u2019s Department of External Relations list of accredited service providers \nwho will be responsible for graphics and design, typesetting, and page layout. Appendix 3 \nprovides the outline terms of reference for consultants. \n \n22.  Purchases of equipment (computer hardware and software) and statistical databases will \nbe undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time \nto time) and in coordination with ADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and Technology and \nOffice of Administrative Services, where applicable. After the TA is completed, any procured \nequipment will be disposed in compliance with ADB guidelines on administering grant-financed \nTA projects. Disbursements under this TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The project officer \nand other ADB experts will serve as contributors to the research and development of the \nknowledge products or as resource persons during the workshops to be conducted under this \nTA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $850,000 on a grant basis for \nThe Future of Regional Cooperation and Integration in Asia and the Pacific, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n                                                \n12 To reduce administrative burden and improve economy, efficiency, and value for money under the TA, most of the \ninternational consultants will be given output-based contracts. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Technical Assistance is Aligned with \nRCI initiatives that address the emerging challenges faced by ADB\u2019s DMCs are implemented \n (ADB Strategy 2020)a \nP  roject Results  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nChain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nNew and/or  By 2016, at least one new  Consolidated report and  Key country and \nenhanced RCI  and/or enhanced RCI  publication  development partner \ninitiatives are  initiative per thematic area  officials are not \nidentified  is identified  available to attend and \nparticipate in \n   \nconsultations and \nmeetings \nOutputs       \n1.
