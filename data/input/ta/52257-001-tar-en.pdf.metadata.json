The ongoing transaction technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Social Protection \nReforms was approved for $1 million in February 2016 as part of the PHI: Social Protection \nSupport Project (Additional Financing). This TA is being proposed to be expanded into a TA facility \nwith $1 million additional financing from the Asian Development Bank Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund (TASF-Others). The TA facility will (i) continue ongoing policy and advisory and \ncapacity development support to the executing agency under the ongoing loan, (ii) prepare the \nproposed Expanded Social Assistance Project and (iii) provide policy and advisory and capacity \ndevelopment support to the executing agency under the ensuing loan. \n \n2.  The TA facility will deliver the following outputs specifically for the ensuing Expanded \nSocial Assistance Project. \n \n3.  Output 1: Policy gaps in social protection identified and options developed (2020-\n2023). The TA will support the continued development of national policies for social protection \n(with a focus on social assistance) by identifying thematic areas where gaps exist. It will provide \npolicy and advisory support under the government\u2019s new Social Protection Framework and \nOperational Plan (expected to be approved in 2019). \n \n4.  Output 2: Operational gaps and governance risks in social protection service \ndelivery identified and action plans prepared (2020-2023). This output will deploy consultants \non an as needed basis to help the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) \nreview its systems, business processes, financial management, and operations, particularly for \nthe conditional cash transfer (CCT) and social pension programs. Recommendations will be \nprovided in the form of proposed guidelines, revisions to manuals, or operational and financial \nmanagement instructions. Areas of focus will include payments, financial management, and \ntargeting.  \n \n5.  Output 3: Knowledge products on best practices in social protection prepared and \ndisseminated (2020-2023). Outputs 1 and 2 will inform the preparation of policy briefs and action \nplans to support the government\u2019s social protection agenda\u2014with a focus on the CCT, the social \npension, and other social assistance. The briefs will provide policy options and proposed reforms \nthat the government may adopt. This output will also support other knowledge products and \npublications on a demand-driven basis. \n \n1.  Output 4: New social protection project prepared (Q4 2018- Q1 2020) This output will \nidentify the scope and coverage of the proposed Expanded Social Assistance Project, complete \ndue diligence requirements, and prepare implementation arrangements. A team of consultants \nwith expertise in social policy, digital payments, social pensions, financial management, poverty \ntargeting, gender mainstreaming,  and  other  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB)  due  diligence \nrequirements, will work closely with DSWD and ADB staff.  \n \n7.
