Of these, about\n370,000 people, or 74,000 poor families, are expected to move above\nthe poverty line in 11 districts in six provinces of Indonesia: Central\nKalimantan,  East  Kalimantan,  South  Kalimantan,  Central  Sulawesi,\nNorth Sulawesi, and Southeast Sulawesi. Community-based savings\nand loan organizations (CBSLOs) will be formed and trained to support\nmicroenterprises and small enterprises, and needed rural infrastructure\nwill  be  provided  to  promote  rural  urban  linkages.  The  Project  will\nrevitalize poverty reduction efforts in the rural sector by supporting the\nGovernment\u2019s  program  to  devolve  development  resources  to  local\ngovernments and strengthening the institutional and human resource\ncapacity necessary to enable rural communities nationwide to plan and\nmanage local development initiatives. About 40 more districts from 20\nnew provinces will benefit from the institutional and capacity-building\nprogram to support the Government decentralization efforts.\nClassification Primary: Poverty reduction\nSecondary: Human resources development\nEnvironmental Category B. An initial environmental examination was undertaken and\nAssessment the summary is presented as a supplementary appendix.\nRationale Government\u2019s  successful  poverty  reduction  program  suffered  a\nsignificant set back due to the recent economic crisis. Although the\nincidence of poverty has since returned to its pre-crisis level of 18.2\npercent, the crisis demonstrated that economic shocks could cause high\nsurges in the incidence of poverty. It also highlighted the need for a\nlong-term strategy based on social inclusion and addressing capability\ndeprivation of the poor to make a significant impact on poverty. Lack of\nformal  financial  services  and  institutional  support  from  districts  and\nurban business communities are particularly common impediments to\nincreasing rural enterprise development. The Project aims to remove\nthese constraints. Past experience indicates that decentralized decision\nmaking  and  devolving  resources  directly  to  local  government\nsignificantly  decreases  the  cost  of  development  implementation  and\nincreases  the  direct  benefits  of  development  projects  for  local\ncommunities. From that perspective, the Project is intended to support\nthe  Government\u2019s  renewed  efforts  since  April  1999  to  decentralize\ndecision  making  and  devolve  development  resources  to  local\ngovernments and communities. Two new laws that were passed in 1999\ngrant autonomy to district and village governments, in effect giving them\ntheir  own  resources  with  which  to  plan  and  manage  their  own\ndevelopment  based  on  local  needs.  Such  decision-making  powers\nunderscore the need for adequate institutional capacity to effect the\ndemocratic  processes  of  decision  making  now  entrusted  to  local\ngovernments and communities. Under this framework, the Project is\naimed at supporting formal and informal training and decision-making\nprocesses  that  would  give  local  communities  and  government  the", "iii\nrequired institutional capacity to better utilize the resources for poverty\nreduction and improvement of the quality of life in their communities.\nObjectives and The development goal is to increase the real incomes of the poor and in\nScope  particular,  rural  communities  on  the  periphery  of  regional  growth\ncenters.  The  objectives  of  the  Project  are  to  (i)  empower  rural\ncommunities by strengthening their capacity to plan and manage their\nown development activities, and (ii) support investments, foster rural-\nurban linkages, and establish rural infrastructure to promote agricultural\nproductivity and off-farm business enterprises.\nThe  Project  will  have  four  components.  Part  A  will  support  (i)  an\ninstitutional  development  process  to  improve  community-based\nplanning mechanisms to help local government and village communities\nplan  and  implement  development  programs  according  to  the  new\ndecentralization  laws,  (ii)  human  resource  development  to  support\nformal degree training for 1,773 staff of the Directorate General of Rural\nCommunity Empowerment (DGRCE) and local governments involved in\ncommunity  development,  and  (iii)  a  village  grant  to  support  the\ncommunity training program. Part B will support the establishment of\nCBSLOs in the targeted areas of Kalimantan and Sulawesi (about 750\nvillage communities) so that the targeted communities would have the\ncapacity  to  obtain  and  service  loans  from  financial  institutions  for\nmicroenterprise development. A credit line of $15.0 million from the loan\nwill  be  provided  through  regional  development  banks  or  Bank\nPembangunan Daerah (BPDs). Part C will support the construction of\nrural  infrastructure  for  the  targeted  communities  to  link  poor\ncommunities  to  markets.  Part  D  will  provide  support  for  project\nmanagement and monitoring.\nCost Estimates The estimated total cost of the Project is $170.2 million equivalent,\ncomprising about $45.5 million in foreign exchange costs and $124.7\nmillion equivalent in local currency costs.\nFinancing Plan1                                                                                                                 ($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percent\nAsian Development Bank\n       OCR 27.3 37.7 65.0\n       ADF 18.2 31.8 50.0\nSubtotal 45.5 69.5 115.0 68\nGovernment 0.0 55.2 55.2 32\nTotal 45.5 124.7 170.2 100\nADF = Asian Development Fund, OCR = ordinary capital resources.\n Loan Amounts and Two loans comprising (i) the loan in various currencies equivalent to\nTerms Special Drawing Rights 38,752,000 from the Asian Development Bank\u2019s\n(ADB\u2019s) Special Funds resources (SFR), with an amortization period of\n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge at\n                                                \n1 Based on 80 percent financing of total Project cost for the first three years of Project implementation and 60\npercent financing for the remaining three years.", "iv\nthe rate of 1 percent during the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter,\nand  (ii)  the  loan  of  $65  million  equivalent  from  its  ordinary  capital\nresources (OCR), with interest to be determined in accordance with the\nADB pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans, with a\nmaturity of 25 years, including a grace period of 6 years, a front-end fee\nof 1 percent of the OCR loan amount, and an annual commitment\ncharge of 0.75 percent.\nAllocation and Most  of  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loans  will  finance  capacity\nRelending Terms building and training for communities and community institutions and\nlocal government workers; support the formation of CBSLOs in the rural\nareas for microenterprise and small enterprise investments and provide\nformal credit to CBSLOs through BPDs; and finance rural infrastructure\nto  link  rural  enterprises  to  markets  at  urban  growth  centers.  The\nMinistry of Finance will relend a part of the OCR funds to six BPDs\nunder a subsidiary loan agreement at an interest rate of not less than\nthe reference rate (defined as the average rate of interest prevailing for\n90-day rupiah-denominated Bank Indonesia Certificate [SBI] over the\nmost recent three months). The interest rate will be reviewed annually\nby ADB and the Government. The BPD will onlend to CBSLOs at an\ninterest rate equivalent to the interest rate payable by BPD under the\nrelevant  subsidiary  loan  agreement  plus  a  maximum  of  8  percent\nmargin, which is currently about 20 percent. The interest rate charged\nby each CBSLO to its borrowing members would be set by its members\nbut  would  probably  be  between  30  and  33  percent,  corresponding\napproximately to the market rates prevailing in the project area.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2007\nExecuting Agency The Directorate General of Rural Community Empowerment (DGRCE)\nof the Ministry of Home Affairs and Regional Autonomy.\nImplementation As Executing Agency, DGRCE, will be responsible for overall project\nArrangements implementation and coordination with the implementing agencies (IAs).\nIt will establish a project management office (PMO) in Jakarta. Each\nparticipating  province  will  coordinate  and  monitor  project-related\nactivities in several districts, and will establish a project coordination\noffice (PCO). Project implementation at the district level will be the\nresponsibility of the district government, which will serve as the IA in\neach district. Each district will establish a project implementation unit\n(PIU) for this purpose. A project steering committee will be set up for\npolicy coordination at the national level. Each participating province will\nestablish  a  provincial  advisory  group  to  provide  full  liaison  and\ncoordination with their PCOs and PIUs. Each participating district will\nestablish a district advisory group to advise on measures to address\nproblems affecting project implementation.\nProcurement Goods and services financed by ADB under the Project will be procured\nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  Simple  and\ntechnically non-complicated civil works costing up to $50,000 will be\nconstructed by villagers through community participation in accordance\nwith procedures acceptable to ADB, while relatively complex civil works\ncosting  up  to  $500,000  will  be  carried  out  on  the  basis  of  local\ncompetitive bidding (LCB). Utility vehicles, motorcycles, computers, and", "v\noffice equipment will be procured by international shopping or, if valued\nunder $100,000 equivalent, by direct purchase.\nConsulting Services About 1,054 person-months of consulting services (236 international,\nand  818  domestic)  for  supporting  project  implementation  will  be\nrequired.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Recruitment,  training,  and\nfielding of local trainers and facilitators will be contracted to qualified\nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) in accordance with procedures\nacceptable to ADB.\nEstimated Project 31 December 2006\nCompletion Date\nProject Benefits The Project will directly increase the incomes of poor families, through\nand Beneficiaries microenterprise and small scale enterprise development in the rural\nareas, and improve linkages to markets, social and health services by\nimproving rural infrastructure. About 370,000 people, or 74,000 poor\nfamilies, will increase their incomes to levels above the poverty line. The\nProject will directly benefit about 550,000 people, or 110,000 families, in\nthe project area, equivalent to 4 percent of the population, through\ncapacity  building  for  local  government,  employment,  and  enterprise\ndevelopment.  About  1.1  million  people,  or  220,000  families,  in  11\ndistricts will benefit from improved rural infrastructure enabling them\naccess not only to markets in nearby urban centers for their products\nbut also to social and health services. The financial internal rate of\nreturn  from  the  microenterprises  and  small  scale  enterprises  is\nestimated  at  45  percent,  which  adequately  covers  the  33  percent\ninterest rate on capital investment. The economic internal rate of return\nis estimated at about 17 percent. Nonquantifiable benefits are expected\nfrom the capacity-building component of the Project: strengthened rural\ncommunity  and  local  government  institutions  and  better  trained\ncommunity  development  workers.  Women  will  benefit  directly  from\ntraining  for  local  communities  and  financial  services  for\nmicroenterprises, most of which are expected to be women-owned.\nTechnical Advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  financial  management\nAssistance system will assist the DGRCE to develop a system for disbursement,\nmonitoring, and accounting of funds in 11 districts in six provinces to\nensure accountability and transparency. The TA will provide a total of\n51 person-months of international (23) and domestic (28) consulting\nservices, inclusive of 12 months of NGO consortium services. The total\ncost of the TA is estimated at $1.4 million equivalent. The Government\nhas requested that  $1.1 million be financed by ADB on a grant basis\nfrom the Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility (ACCSF).The grant was\nprovided, given the strong focus of the TA on good governance and\nsound  fiscal  management  in  support  of  poverty  reduction.

I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  Report  and  Recommendation  on  (i)  two\nproposed  loans  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Community  Empowerment  for  Rural\nDevelopment Project, and (ii) proposed technical assistance for the Financial Management\nSystem.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. In response to a request from the Government, the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nprovided  two  technical  assistance  (TA)  grants  to  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs\u2019  (MOHA)1\nDirectorate General of Rural Community Empowerment (DGRCE) for formulating two projects\nthat would address the need for capacity building for community development2 and poverty\nreduction,3 respectively. Subsequent discussions between the Government and ADB resulted in\nan  agreement  to  combine  the  two  studies  to  formulate  the  proposed  Project.  A  Loan\nReconnaissance  Mission  on  21-25  February  2000  discussed  with  Government  officials  a\nnumber of issues related to the design and processing of the combined Project. A Loan Fact-\nFinding Mission was conducted on 21 March-14 April 2000 and an Appraisal Mission on 5-26\nJune  2000.4  During  loan  fact-finding,  representatives  of  multilateral  and  bilateral  funding\nagencies  were  consulted  to  inform  them  about  the  Project  and  to  exchange  views  on\ndecentralization, microfinance, and poverty reduction. This report is based on the findings of\nthese missions; the consultants\u2019 feasibility study reports; socioeconomic baseline surveys; an\ninitial environmental report; and consultations with national, regional, and local governments,\nregional development banks (BPDs), beneficiaries, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs),\nand consultants. Workshops conducted with the target communities helped in determining the\ndesign, scope, and implementation arrangements for the Project. The project framework is in\nAppendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  Poverty in the Rural Sector\n3. Prior  to  the  economic  crisis  in  mid-1997,  Indonesia  had  a  sound  record  of  rapid\neconomic growth, steadily rising development indicators, and an impressive reduction in the\nincidence of poverty. Official figures show that poverty declined steadily over a 20-year period,\nfrom 40 percent in 1976 to 11.3 percent in February 1996.5  The record is impressive, but\nbecause of its large population base, in absolute terms, Indonesia has the largest number of\npoor people among the countries of Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Two thirds of the\nIndonesian poor are rural residents.\n                                                \n1  Starting on 23 August 2000, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Regional Autonomy have been merged\nto become the Ministry of Home Affairs and Regional Autonomy.\n2  TA 2858-INO: Capacity Building for Community Development Project, for $970,000, approved on 8 September\n1997.\n3  TA 3088-INO: Development of Rural-Urban Linkage Project, for $890,000, approved on 15 October 1998.\n4  The ADB team comprised A. T. Perez, Mission Leader; S.T. Chew, Senior Poverty Reduction Coordinator; W.H.\nMenninger, Senior Project Engineer; M. K. Mitchell, Project Economist; N. K. Jain, Programs Economist; O.\nTiwana, Counsel; L. Kulp, Economist (Social Sectors); M. Sultana, Social Development Specialist; and J. Tokeshi,\nProject Economist, Rural Finance.\n5  The consumption basket was revised in 1998. Under the revision, the incidence of poverty in 1996 was estimated\nat 17.7: 13.7 in the urban areas and 19.9 in the rural areas.", "2\n4. As a result of the economic crisis since the latter half of 1997, spiraling inflation and\nlosses of employment opportunities plunged a large proportion of the population into transient\npoverty. The incidence of poverty peaked in December 1998 at 24.2 percent6 (21.9 percent\nurban and 25.7 percent rural). However, starting in March 1999, Indonesia entered a period of\nprice deflation, particularly in the price of rice. This, combined with the slow rise in nominal\nwages, reversed the trend and the incidence of poverty began to abate. By August 1999, the\nlatest available official measurement of poverty indicated that poverty had returned to near pre-\ncrisis levels of 18.2 percent (15.1 percent urban and 20.2 percent rural). The crisis amply\ndemonstrated that economic shocks can cause dramatically high surges in the incidence of\npoverty costly to political and social stability, and long-term development. To make a significant\nimpact  on  rural  poverty,  combating  poverty  in  Indonesia  must  therefore  involve  prioritizing\ndevelopment goals \u2013 developing a well thought-out and long-term strategy based on social\ninclusion \u2013 and addressing capability deprivation among the poor.\n5. Growth in the rural economy has contributed significantly to Indonesia\u2019s stable economic\ngrowth and in the decline of poverty over the past two decades. Growth in the rural sector\nincreased the demand for labor and resulted in greater employment and higher real wages in\nthe economy. A recent study of the real wage data for Indonesia demonstrates that in the\n1990s,  poverty  declines  were  inversely  related  to  real  wage  increases.7    Between  1990\nand1993, when real agricultural wages in Java increased by 19.2 percent, the number of poor\npeople declined by 4.8 percent. The relationship was even stronger during 1993-1996 when real\nwages increased by 14.2 percent and poverty declined by 13.1 percent. Conversely, as real\nwages declined sharply during the economic crisis, poverty incidence increased equally sharply.\nMirroring  the  poverty  trends,  underemployment  (working  less  than  35  hours  a  week)  has\nremained a truly rural phenomenon. A recent study by the International Labour Organization\nfound that, while underemployment affected nearly 60 percent of employed farm workers, only\n25 percent of nonagricultural workers were underemployed in 1998.8 Furthermore, a larger\nproportion of underemployed rural workers were actively seeking work compared with their\nurban counterparts. Improvements in real wages and rapid creation of jobs for unskilled and\nsemi-skilled workers are thus key to a long-term strategy for poverty reduction.\n6. The  economic  crisis  significantly  aggravated  the  poverty  situation,  but  the  political\nturmoil that followed showed the weakness of focusing on income alone and not addressing\nalso the issues of social exclusion,9 which left the country susceptible to political unrest. The\nconcept of social exclusion provides a good framework for discussing the factors affecting the\ncapability deprivation of the rural poor. The rural poor have been excluded from many activities\nthat  could  otherwise  allow  them  to  improve  their  income  and  quality  of  life.  The  political\nprocesses in rural communities have largely been driven by appointed officials. Decisions on\ndevelopment priorities emanating from central ministries not only exclude the poor from the\nprocess  of  setting  development  priorities,  but  also  provide  no  accountability  check  on  the\nperformance of the responsible authorities. Given the remoteness of many rural areas, the poor\ncan be physically excluded from markets, financial services, and social services (like health care\nand education) because the transaction cost to gain access to these markets or services is\nbeyond their means. The rural poor are also excluded from a broad body of information ranging\n                                                \n6  Based on the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, using the 1998 methodology.\n7  Papanek, G. and B.

A widely held belief is that the centralized and top-down approaches that characterize\ndevelopment planning and investments in Indonesia have not been cost-efficient; they have\nsocially excluded the community, particularly the poor, and have had the unintended effect of\ncreating large pockets of underserviced areas. Overly centralized planning structures tend to\nfavor over-generalized selection criteria so that local demands and needs of socially vulnerable\ngroups are often overlooked. As a result of exclusion, many poverty-reduction programs are not\ndesigned with sufficient sensitivity to the poor so that services often miss their intended targets.\nMany programs are unsustainable for lack of local demand and ownership. In an effort to make\nthe system inclusive, bottom-up planning was introduced in Indonesia in 1981: village proposals\nwere formulated by village committees representing each sector. However, studies show that\nonly 5-10 percent of the proposals generated at the village level and forwarded to higher levels\nwere funded. The reasons given for this lack of success included the lack of human resources\nto conduct the participatory processes adequately, lack of local planning skills, and dominance\nof district sectoral agencies in decision making.\n8. Poor rural communities were cut off from economic growth in the past. They are, as\nnoted above, physically excluded or inadequately linked to the transportation and marketing\nnetworks that serve growth centers. Hence, lack of adequate rural infrastructure is a good proxy\nfor  the  many  related  constraints  faced  by  such  communities,  including  the  lack  of  social\nservices. Experience shows that communities can be relied upon to identify crucial linkages to\nmarkets, and are capable of planning and implementing the construction of small scale rural\ninfrastructure. Leaving the decision-making powers with communities, which can also have a\nsubstantial role in constructing infrastructure, fosters community ownership and transparency in\nimplementing  project  activities.  Similar  insights  were  drawn  from  experience  elsewhere  in\nAsia\u2014lack of rural infrastructure underlies the disadvantaged economic position of the rural\npoor.10 In a recent World Bank survey of poverty in Indonesia, the poor unanimously cited lack\nof income generation opportunities as an underlying cause of their disadvantaged economic\nposition.11 In short, groups that are physically excluded from the mainstream economy are\ndeprived of the opportunity to expand their capabilities and remain trapped in a cycle of poverty.\n2. Financial Institutions\n9. The communities in the rural areas targeted by the Project show a wide range of\ncapabilities  to  produce  goods  and  services.  However,  lack  of  credit  and  lack  of  social\npreparation  suppress  the  entrepreneurial  initiatives  of  the  poor.  The  vast  majority  of\ncommunities, especially their poorer members, have no access to formal financial services.\nEven schemes such as those operated by Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) through its village unit\nnetwork do not reach most villages and tend to cater to those with incomes well above the\npoverty line. It may also be noted that where BRI operates in the rural areas of Kalimantan and\nSulawesi, it has a complete or near monopoly which, naturally, it is reluctant to share. Another\nsuccessful approach to finance is the privately based credit unions (para. 13), but these are not\nyet active in the project area. Although there are savings groups (arisan) in the project area,\nalmost always they are organized by women, whose members by choice are limited to 25 to 30.\nThe money from such a savings group is not enough to meet the business capital needs of all\nmembers or the needs for their children\u2019s education. As a result, a larger group \u2013 community-\n                                                \n10 TA 5767-REG: A Study of Rural Asia, for $1.8 million, approved on 29 December 1997.\n11 The World Bank survey of poverty in Indonesia (1999) was part of a global research effort entitled Consultations\n    with the Poor.", "4\nbased savings and loan organization (CBSLO), composed of men and women, and open to all\nmembers  of  the  community  has  been  designed  to  address  the  need  for  rural  financial\ninstitutions in the project area. Special care will be taken to ensure that poor members of the\ncommunity are accorded equal opportunity to become members of, and benefit from, CBSLO\nactivities.\n10. At present, the services of commercial banks are not available in the project area.\nNevertheless, six regional development banks (BPDs), have expressed interest in participating\nin  the  Project.12  In  the  past,  BPDs  were  essentially  involved  with  the  financing  of  local\ngovernment and government employees\u2019 salaries, together with collateral-backed commercial\nlending and some subsidized credit schemes. Recently, their role has started to change and\nthey are becoming more involved in the commercial development of their respective provinces.\nPotentially, they could develop into very useful alternative financial institutions as wholesalers of\ncredit to small organizations such as CBSLOs in the project area. The BPDs recognize that\ntaking  part  in  a  project  of  this  nature  is  challenging,  and  could  lead  to  a  much  stronger\ncontribution to the development of financial services and an improvement in their skills in\nlending on a commercial risk-bearing basis. The BPDs have solid financial expertise; however,\nthey will need training in risk assessment in relation to small organizations engaged in savings\nand lending, such as the envisaged CBSLOs. As part of this training, the BPDs will be exposed\nto existing, successful primary credit unions or similar organizations to experience at firsthand\nthe process of initial formation and first stage development, the membership rules that have to\nbe established, and possible legal structures. From this process, they will develop the skills not\nonly for taking part in the project but also for continuing such activities after project completion.\n11. It is noted that the six BPDs have limited experience in providing wholesale credit to\nnonbank organizations whose members are the ultimate borrowers. These funds were obtained\nfrom  Bank  Indonesia.  One  BPD,  BPD  South  Kalimantan,  has  had  broader  and  longer\nexperience in wholesaling credit, being a participant in the ADB Microcredit Project13 since the\nstart of the Project in 1994. Although the BPDs have their main headquarters in the provincial\ncapitals, they have a branch or subbranch in almost all of the project districts.\n12. Many NGOs have been effective in facilitating social preparation of communities and\nformation of self-help groups able to access formal credit and to plan and implement village\nrural infrastructure projects, assisted by ADB, the World Bank and Japan Bank for International\nCooperation (JBIC). Such experience will be useful in forming the CBSLOs proposed under the\nProject. The participation of NGO facilitators has been incorporated in the project design. The\nconsultants who prepared the feasibility study identified 166 NGOs14 in six provinces.15 Between\nfour  and  eight  have  been  assessed  as  suitable  to  serve  as  facilitators  in  three  Sulawesi\nprovinces.  The  capability  of  NGOs  in  three  Kalimantan  provinces  will  be  assessed  during\nimplementation.\n13. The  formation  of  any  savings  and  loan  organization  or  credit  union  such  as  the\nenvisaged CBSLOs depends, first and foremost, on the commitment of the membership. Hence,\n                                                \n12 The six are BPD Central Sulawesi, BPD North Sulawesi, BPD Southeast Sulawesi, BPD Central Kalimantan, BPD\nEast Kalimantan, and BPD South Kalimantan. The name identifies the province that owns the BPD and where it is\nlocated.\n13 Loan 1327-INO, for $25.7 million, approved on 25 October 1994.\n14 TA 3088-INO: Development of Rural-Urban Linkages Project, for $890,000, approved on 15 October 1998. Of the\ntotal, 11 NGOs each are found in East Kalimantan and Central Kalimantan, 12 in South Kalimantan, 23 in North\nSulawesi, 72 in Central Sulawesi, and 37 in South East Sulawesi.\n15 The six provinces are Central Sulawesi, North Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi, Central Kalimantan, East Kaliman-\ntan, and South Kalimantan.", "5\nthe  beginning  of  the  process  requires  an  extensive  introduction  of  prospective  members\n(including poor and women members) to the concept and the objectives involved. Visits to\nexisting  organizations  or  by  members  of  such  organizations  can  help  enormously.  The\nintroduction and training process are best conducted by those who have direct experience\nelsewhere, especially NGOs or others independent of government. Indonesia has had a strong\ncooperative movement for about 30 years. The Credit Union Federation is the national-level\norganization of the Indonesian credit union movement. It has 27 regional chapters nationwide,\nincluding three regional credit unions in the project area: one each in North Sulawesi, South\nSulawesi, and Central Sulawesi. They comprise 53 local credit unions with a total savings of\nRp4,852  million  ($585,000  equivalent).  Although  there  are  no  credit  unions  in  the  three\nKalimantan provinces, there is one regional chapter in West Kalimantan, which has 27 local\ncredit unions with savings of Rp14,288 million ($517,000 equivalent).\n14. The basic rules and principles that a savings and loan organization (such as the CBSLO)\nneed to incorporate into its founding documentation can easily be drawn from the Credit Union\nFederation with wide experience in the field, but the members themselves should have the final\nsay. The same applies to procedures for making and recording savings, and later loans, as the\norganization  develops.  The  level  of  deposits,  membership,  and  activity  required  before\ndrawdown can be made by CBSLO will be subject to project guidelines, but will also depend on\nthe agreement reached with the BPD itself.\n3. Women in Development\n15. Women in the rural areas of the Project contribute to economic development in many\nways.  They  are  involved  in  agricultural  work,  participating  in  production  and  postharvest\nactivities. To augment farm income, women conduct petty trading by selling snacks and meals\nthey prepare at home, and selling vegetables and fruits from their gardens. Many are also\ninvolved in cottage industries such as making rattan mats and finishing local semiprecious\nstones.  They  also  seek  employment  as  farm  workers  or  daily  work  as  laborers  in  local\nconstruction projects. However, women in the project area suffer from low wages and lack of\naccess  to  capital,  skills  training,  appropriate  technology,  extension  services,  and  market\nfacilities. Due to lack of access to formal credit, women depend on private moneylenders and\nborrow funds at exorbitant interest rates. As noted, the resources of the small arisan savings\ngroup are not sufficient to meet all of its members needs; however, the social capital that has\nbeen developed in forming these groups can be tapped in forming CBSLOs.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n16. In the mid-1990s, the Government committed itself to eradicating poverty. At the start of\nthe sixth Five-Year Development Plan (REPELITA VI), FY1994/95-1998/99, the Government\nlaunched a special program, the Inpres Desa Tertinggal (Presidential Instructions for Less\nDeveloped  Villages  [IDT]),16  which  supported  infrastructure  development  and  economic\nactivities  in  targeted  IDT  villages.  The  program  benefited  about  28,000  villages  with  an\nestimated 13 million people or about half of the population identified to be living below the\npoverty line. The IDT program consisted of direct grant, village infrastructure and technical\nguidance.  MOHA  supported  by  BAPPENAS  (National  Development  Planning  Agency)\nadministered the direct grant scheme and the infrastructure support program. Grants of Rp20\nmillion ($8,500 equivalent at that time) were given to each IDT village per year, depending on\nthe village populations, for three years to help create and expand economic opportunities for\n                                                \n16 Through Presidential Instruction No. 5/1993.", "6\npoor community members. The village infrastructure program sought to increase market access\nand  break  the  isolation  of  IDT  villages,  improve  health  standards,  promote  employment\nopportunities, build the capacity of village institutions, and improve the capability of villagers to\nplan, implement, and maintain village infrastructure. The IDT program had some difficulties due\nto insufficient institutional support and shortage of sustainable financial services, but its impact\nhas been recognized.\n17. Laws 22 and 25 which were passed in 1999, hold the promise of a decentralized\nadministrative system that will strengthen institutional links between civil society as represented\nby elected village bodies and the subdistrict and district governments.17 They are necessary\nmeasures to address regional economic disparities and to transfer resources for development\nprograms. When fully implemented, the laws will convert Indonesia\u2019s districts into autonomous\nareas  with  fully  elected  government  authority  to  address  the  interests  of  their  rural\nconstituencies. Village communities themselves would be given new powers as indigenous\nautonomous areas to elect through democratic processes representatives for village councils,\nreplacing the previously government-appointed village heads and committees. These changes\nare expected to spawn local government-sponsored development initiatives more attuned to\nlocal community needs. Viewed in the context of social exclusion, the two laws constitute a\ncritically important initiative. They give communities, including the poor within the communities,\nthe power to hold local leaders accountable.\n18. The Government\u2019s development priorities are contained in its medium-term development\nprogram (PROPENAS), which describes the Government agenda for 2001-2005. PROPENAS\ncontains five broad development objectives aimed at (i) ensuring national cohesion and social\nstability, (ii) achieving good governance and rule of law, (iii) accelerating economic recovery and\nstrengthening  the  foundations  for  sustained  growth,  (iv)  developing  the  social  sectors  and\nhuman welfare, and (v) strengthening regional autonomy, rural and urban development and\nstructural  poverty  programs.  PROPENAS  also  addresses  a  range  of  cross-cutting  issues\ncovering  poverty,  gender,  and  environmental  sustainability.  Economic  recovery,  good\ngovernance,  infrastructure  rehabilitation  to  support  production,  regional  autonomy  through\ndecentralization, poverty reduction, and women in development, which are key components of\nthe  Government\u2019s  medium-term  strategy  and  which  address  cross-cutting  issues,  are  also\nmajor concerns of the Project.\n19. In preparing to implement the two laws on decentralization in 2001, the Government is\nreorganizing and restructuring the entire administrative system. The mandates of key ministries\nformerly  responsible  for  regional  government  administration,  including  MOHA,  have  been\nchanged to accord with the provisions of the laws. MOHA\u2019s new mandate is to facilitate the role\nof regional governments as they assume their new responsibilities and is confined to policy\nmatters stemming from the new relationship between the regional and the Central governments.\nIn effect, MOHA will have a much-reduced role in regional government affairs.\n20. The MOHA reorganization has involved specific changes in the function and staff of the\nDirectorate General of Rural Community Development (DGRCD).  First, DGRCD was renamed\nDirectorate-General  of  Rural  Community  Empowerment  (DGRCE).  The  new  name  reflects\nDGRCE\u2019s new mission to support and facilitate (rather than lead, as was previously the case)\ncommunity development planning and coordinate with local government and sectoral agencies\nin implementing programs.  Second, as of January 2001, DGRCE staff serving at provincial,\ndistrict,  and  subdistrict  levels  will  become  the  staff  of  the  respective  levels  of  regional\n                                                \n17 Law No. 22/1999 on Regional Government and Law No. 25/1999 on Fiscal Balance.", "7\ngovernment.  The  devolved  staff,  particularly  those  currently  serving  at  the  districts  and\nsubdistricts are expected to retain their functions as the interface between the district and\nsubdistrict government administration and the village community.\n21. The Government has assigned to MOHA the task of reorienting and retraining DGRCE\nstaff  and  the  devolved  staff  for  their  new  responsibilities  as  the  sponsors  of  community\ndevelopment interests in the central and regional government administration, respectively. In\nturn,  Central  Government  will  assist  the  regional  governments  as  they  assume  their  new\nresponsibilities and absorb the new staff, particularly at the districts and subdistricts where they\nare currently the weakest. These are the levels where, at present, the existing DGRCE staffing\nlevels are only 43 percent of the 81 positions gazetted per district, and where the educational\nattainment of the staff is generally lower than that in other agencies of the same level. Most of\nthe field staff are graduates of technical high schools. The new responsibilities entrusted to\nDGRCE staff at these levels may be beyond their skills level to undertake well. DGRCE staff\nhave fewer women than men at both the provincial and central levels: an average of 22 percent\ncovering the three provinces in Kalimantan and 25 percent for the three provinces in Sulawesi,\ncompared with about 34 percent at the central level.\n22. To augment its limited staff resources, DGRCE has used NGO community facilitators to\nassist  in  promoting  community  participation,  increasing  income,  and  implementing  rural\ndevelopment projects. Considerable human resource and institutional strengthening efforts are\nrequired for the central-to-regional-government resource transfer to bear fruit, and should be\nviewed as a priority in forging the new relationship and instituting good governance practices.\nThe Government\u2019s request for ADB assistance in addressing this issue in the context of a rural\ndevelopment project reflects well its commitment to effecting the new decentralized system.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n23. The major internationally funded projects directed at reducing poverty under the IDT\nprogram through rural infrastructure development and microfinance are those supported by\nADB,  World  Bank,  and  JBIC.  A  summary  of  the  progress  made  is  presented  in  the\nsupplementary appendix.\n24. The  first  phase  of  the  Government  of  Japan-financed  Rural  Areas  Infrastructure\nDevelopment Project, which started in 1995, supported infrastructure development in 3,447 IDT\nvillages in 21 provinces outside Java and Bali. The second phase began in 1997 and is\nestimated to have provided infrastructure to 7,500 IDT villages outside Java and Bali. The\nsecond phase was extended to three years due to the economic crisis. The third phase will be\nimplemented during 2000-2003 in about 2,500 villages in 550 subdistricts. Most of the funds\nwere used for improving access road infrastructure in a cluster of neighboring villages, and\nwater supply and sanitation facilities. Although the village infrastructure development took the\ndistrict as the unit of planning, the subproject proposals originated from the village and were\napproved at the district level. Community-based organizations were used to construct village\nsubprojects, assisted by contractors who supplied skilled labor, and equipment, and carried out\nworks beyond the capacity of the local people. The third phase would place more emphasis on\nthe planning process and implementation of subprojects than on the simple outcome of the\nconstruction  of  the  infrastructure,  through  the  active  participation  of  local  community\norganizations.  The  process  approach  will  focus  on  capacity  building  for  local  community\norganizations and community development. Underlying the reorientation of the approaches in\nthe third phase is the experience in the first two phases, which demonstrated the key role that\ncommunity involvement in decision making plays in the success of the project. The third phase,", "8\nin  addition  to  constructing  access  infrastructure,  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  will\nfinance agriculture production, postharvest, processing, and marketing support.\n25. The World Bank has implemented two village infrastructure projects (VIPs). VIP I begun\nin 1995 and completed in 1996, benefited 1,230 IDT villages in Java. VIP II, which began in\n1997, benefited an additional 4,500 IDT villages in Java and Sumatra. The key features of the\nVIP  strategy  include  village  participation,  decentralization,  and  transparency.  Each  village\nreceived a one-time grant of Rp120 million ($54,000 equivalent for VIP I and $50,000 for VIP II\nat the corresponding periods) to build infrastructure of its choice from a menu. About 87 percent\nof the village grant under VIP I was used for road and bridge works, and the remaining 13\npercent for drinking water and sanitation. Except for Rp20 million advanced for materials, the\ngrant was disbursed based on work progress. Villagers were empowered to decide priority uses\nof the grant and implemented the subproject themselves with limited reliance on contractors.\nThe services of domestic engineers were provided for planning, designing, and implementing\nthe subprojects. The implementation of the first project was assessed to be highly satisfactory.\nThe second project is still being evaluated.\n26. The World Bank\u2019s Kecamatan Development Project (KDP), approved in 1998, adapts\nthe VIP principles but differs from it in three ways: (i) the KDP provides a block grant to each\nselected subdistrict, which will select from among competing investment proposals submitted by\nvillages; (ii) the KDP funds economic activities, in addition to infrastructure, which are financed\nthrough credit at market rates at a maximum of Rp150 million ($18,000 equivalent) per group,\nand (iii) the KDP provides NGO facilitators in addition to engineering assistance.\n27. In  1999,  ADB  approved  the  Community  and  Local  Government  Support  Sector\nDevelopment Program, involving a policy loan of $200 million and an investment project loan of\n$120 million. The investment project loan provides village grants to poorer districts for improving\nbasic  services  through  labor-intensive  infrastructure  development  and  improvement.  The\namount of the block grant ranges from Rp8 million ($1,000 equivalent) to RP 80 million ($10,000\nequivalent) depending on the population of the village. The implementation of the program is\nprogressing satisfactorily. The first 37 districts in Java have been identified and a second batch\nof 15 districts in Sumatra is under consideration.\n28. ADB has two ongoing microfinance projects in Indonesia. The Microcredit Project18\n(MCP) targets the poor and near poor for microenterprise development by providing credit and\nmobilizing savings in five provinces.19 MCP targets primarily non-IDT villages. Credit is provided\nthrough five BPDs, including BPD South Kalimantan, which onlend to small financial institutions\nand group organizations. NGO facilitators provided training. Most subborrowers are individuals,\nbut self-help group subborrowers are also included. The poor are targeted by the loan size (less\nthan Rp500,000) and through NGOs. The Rural Income Generation Project (RIGP)20 differs\nfrom the MCP in emphasizing the provision of microfinance services to poor people living below\nthe poverty line, and in giving priority to IDT villages through credit provided by Bank Rakyat\nIndonesia. Under the RIGP, rural savings are also mobilized, and training is provided by the\nAgency for Agricultural Education and Training. Field extension workers and NGO facilitators\nassist  in  forming  self-help  groups  and  preparing  business  proposals.  The  MCP  has\ndemonstrated significant benefits to the final borrowers and in developing skills in the small\nfinancial intermediaries. The RIGP has demonstrated that a large number of self-help groups\n                                                \n18  Loan 1327-INO, for $25.7 million, approved on 25 October 1994.\n19  MCP\u2019s five provinces are West Java, Central Java, East Java, South Kalimantan, and West Nusa Tenggara.\n20  Loan 1583-INO, for $78.6 million, approved on 25 November 1997.", "9\ncan  be  rapidly  mobilized  and  that  facilitators  can  play  an  effective  role  in  the  process.\nImplementation of the two projects is considered satisfactory.\n29. The block grant approach in Indonesia is well-tested in externally funded programs. The\nWorld Bank and JBIC have successfully implemented it in a number of recent projects. Under a\nseries of VIPs, communities or villages identified the needed roads, water supply facilities, etc.,\nto be built, which they constructed themselves, assisted by project field engineers and later by\nNGO  facilitators.  Labor  from  the  participating  villages  was  utilized,  which  generated\nemployment. Regarding credit lines to BPDs, ADB has more than five years of successful\nexperience involving BPDs in providing credit. In the ADB MCP, five BPDs, including BPD\nSouth Kalimantan, successfully provided village subborrowers with credit for microenterprise\ndevelopment  in  five  provinces,  among  others,  through  small  nonbank  financial  institutions.\nThese institutions are similar to the CBSLOs that will be formed under the Project. Since such\nnonbank financial institutions do not exist in the project area, the challenge to the Project is to\nestablish viable savings and loan organizations.\nD. Lessons Learned\n30. Formulating the Project has benefited from the experience and lessons learned from\nmany completed or ongoing projects assisted by the ADB,21 JBIC, and World Bank. A summary\nof valuable lessons learned follows:\n(i)  More  active  participation  of  traditional  rural  communities  in  the  mainstream\nformal economy should begin with empowerment of the communities through\nsocial  mobilization,  organization,  and  improved  access  to  adjoining  growth\ncenters where there is a market for the goods and services that the villages can\nproduce.\n(ii)  Emphasis  on  developing  human  resources  at  the  local  level  is  the  key  to\ncommunity empowerment.\n(iii)  The villages that receive block grants should have considerable control over the\ndetails of how their grants are spent. The block grant system is demonstrably\nsuccessful  in  spurring  communities  to  prioritize  their  needs  and  to  allocate\navailable  resources  to  these  activities  reflecting  their  priorities  and  potential\n(KDP, footnote 21).\n(iv)  Increased participation of ordinary people, including poor people, in the decision-\nmaking process and the corresponding pressure from them for transparency\nhave  greatly  assisted  in  combating  the  dangers  from  malfeasance  and\ncorruption.  Election  of  local  officials  allows  communities  to  hold  the  officials\naccountable.\n(v)  If the villages have to compete for infrastructure funds, the rules of competition\nshould favor small-scale labor-intensive projects that will provide facilities for use\nby  the  local  communities.  Substantial  savings  are  made  using  village-based\n                                                \n21 ADB loans: Loan 1605-INO: Central Sulawesi Integrated Area Development and Conservation Project, for $32.0\nmillion, approved on 27 January 1998; Loan 1678-INO: Community and Local Government Support Sector\nDevelopment Program, for $120 million, approved on 25 March 1999. World Bank loans: Loan 3888-IND: Village\nInfrastructure Project, for $72.5 million, approved on 29 June 1995; Loan 4100-IND:Village Infrastructure Project II,\nfor $140.1 million, approved in 1997; Loan 4330-IND: Kecamatan Development Project, for $225.0 million,\napproved on 3 June 1998.", "10\nplanning processes and community labor inputs for small-scale infrastructure\nprojects,  compared  with  projects  that  are  planned  and  implemented  through\nnational sectoral agencies.22\n(vi)  Villagers  are  willing  to  provide  needed  routine  maintenance  for  small-scale\ninfrastructure, that they themselves planned and constructed, with responsibilities\nspelled  out  through  a  memorandum  of  agreement  between  the  village\norganization concerned and project management.\n(vii)  Empowering  the  poor  through  capacity  building  and  human  development  in\nassociation  with  access  to  financial  services  leads  to  a  successful  poverty\nreduction program.\n(viii)  Small borrowers and savers often give greater importance to the ease of access\nto finance than the cost of finance per se. Banking outlets that are a considerable\ndistance from the borrower and take a long time to process loan applications\ndiscourage  small  borrowers.  BPDs  have  successfully  onlent  credit  to\nmicrofinance subborrowers in two ongoing ADB projects.\n(ix)  There is extensive reliance on NGO community facilitators in all projects. The\nfacilitators  can  play  a  useful  role  in  guiding  and  empowering  communities\nthrough  the  transition,  and  in  training  community-based  organizations  in\nmicroenterprise  management,  saving  and  lending  practices,  participatory\nmonitoring and evaluation, marketing, and applied technology. Further, NGO\nparticipation improves transparency and can give a voice to poor marginalized\ngroups who might otherwise be excluded.\n(x)  The management of the project should not be top-heavy; instead it should be\nwidely dispersed to encourage ownership and to be responsive to the needs of\nthe project beneficiaries.\nE.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n31. ADB has had an interim operational strategy for operations in Indonesia since the start\nof the crisis in 1997. However, a new country operational strategy being prepared will reflect\nADB\u2019s overarching objective of poverty reduction and the Government\u2019s strategic priorities. The\ncountry assistance plan (CAP) for Indonesia for 2000 identified several key areas for support in\nthe rural sector. Among the key investment activities emphasized, the Project supports the\ndevelopment of a diversified rural economic base, creation and strengthening of rural-urban\nlinkages,  improvement  of  institutional  capacity,  and  enhancement  of  the  quality  of  human\nresources for community development. Apart from directly creating employment and reducing\nrural  poverty,  the  Project  is  designed  to  play  a  pivotal  role  in  empowering  and  preparing\nprimarily poor rural communities to benefit from the ensuing decentralization of government\nadministrative and financial functions.\n32. In  line  with  the  country  strategy,  the  Project  will  promote  (i)  increased  beneficiary\nparticipation, (ii) enhanced capacity of local governments and strengthened community-based\nservice delivery systems, and (iii) reduced gender disparity. The Project is fully consistent with\nADB\u2019s country and sector strategy and will contribute to achieving ADB\u2019s and the Government\u2019s\nobjective of reducing core poverty.\n                                                \n22 Loan 3888-IND: Village Infrastructure Project, for $72.5 million, approved on 29 June 1995.", "11\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n33. Policy dialogue focused on the decentralization process and flow of funds; devolution\nand training needs; and the role of NGOs and increased participation of women.\n1.  Decentralization Process and Flow of Funds\n34. Lengthy  discussions  were  held  with  the  Government  on  the  implications  of  the\ndecentralization process for the design and implementation of the Project, particularly, the\nproblems decentralization might pose concerning the flow of funds and the arrangements for\ncounterpart  funding.  The  Government  and  the  Mission  agreed  that  loan  funds  and  the\nnecessary counterpart funds will be made available to the Project through annual budgets\nearmarked for financing project activities throughout the implementation period.\n2. Devolution of Staff to Local Government and Training Needs\n35. The  planned  devolution  of  staff  from  national  to  provincial  and  district  authorities,\nalthough formally agreed upon in some cases, still needs to be realized in terms of regional\ngovernment decision making. Discussions with local government officials highlighted the need\nfor increasing the number of staff and meeting their training needs, particularly at the district\nlevel. At present, the existing staff at the district levels in the project area are only 43 percent of\nthe 81 positions gazetted per district, and the educational attainment of staff is generally lower\nthan that in other agencies of the same level. To address the considerable training needs of\ndevolved staff, and existing and future employees, the formal degree-training program under the\nProject was expanded.\n3. Role of  NGOs and Increased Participation of Women\n36. In the interim, while capacity building and training of DGRCE staff are taking place, the\nGovernment will engage the services of local NGO facilitators in the six provinces to assist in\npromoting the participation of a broad spectrum of village participants in the Project, particularly\nthe  poor,  women,  and  indigenous  people.  The  facilitators  will  also  assist  in  training  the\ncommunity-based organizations in microenterprise development and marketing of products;\nsavings and lending activities; participatory monitoring and evaluation; and construction and\nmaintenance of rural infrastructure. The Project will contribute to strengthening the capacity of\nlocal NGOs through training by consultants to be employed under the Project, and will increase\nthe availability of community-based facilitators with expertise in microenterprises, community-\nbased organizations, and development of physical infrastructure. Furthermore, to address the\nGovernment policy of increasing the participation of women beneficiaries and women staff in the\nProject, the Government and the Mission agreed to target increased participation of women\nbeneficiaries in community training and microenterprise development, and in the proportion of\nwomen staff receiving training for diploma, tertiary and graduate degrees and appointment to\nhigh positions in the district government.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n37. The Project is designed to address the significant shortcomings that have led to social\nexclusion of the rural poor and a continuation of their capability deprivation. First, as local\ncommunities become involved in the development planning and implementation process, a", "12\nmajor challenge concerns the lack of institutional capacity to effect planning and allocation of\nresources for community development. The major constraints include the following:\n(i)  Weak human resources at the community, subdistrict, and district levels of government\nwhere  the  link  between  civil  society  and  government  needs  to  be  strong  to  utilize\nresources  intended  for  rural  areas.  For  lack  of  resources  and  skills,  many  village\ncommunity leaders in the project areas are unable to effectively plan or communicate\ntheir community development needs. Their primary spokespersons in the government\nhierarchy, the DGRCE staff in the subdistrict, are spread too thin or lack the necessary\nresources, skills, and incentives to serve their constituent villages adequately.\n(ii)  Domination by sectoral agencies. In the subdistrict, major development priorities are\nusually  set  by  sectoral  agencies,  often  with  little  or  no  consultation  with  local\ncommunities.\n(iii)  Insufficient  resource  allocation.  At  present,  the  allocation  (about  $1,250  per  year)\nreceived by villages for planning development activities is inadequate for preparing more\nthan lists of items proposed by villagers for local rural infrastructure. Village participation\nin effect would be no more than a few meetings conducted for that purpose. Under Law\n25, the amount will likely increase with the increased budget allocations to elected\ndistrict governments. However, the villagers will need new mechanisms to ensure that\nthe  planning  process  goes  beyond  mere  listing  of  their  wishes,  and  measures  to\nenhance  the  transparency  of  their  decision  making  and  accountability  for  using\nresources.\n38. Given these constraints, skilled human resources, and new institutions and mechanisms\nsupportive  of  community  development  and  anchored  in  grassroots  democracy  and  social\ninclusion of the poor, will need to rapidly evolve to realize the good intentions of the new laws. A\nfocused effort and allocation of resources will be needed to encourage local government and\nvillage communities to assume their new responsibilities. Toward this end, the Project will\nsupport formal and informal training of local government staff and villagers, and a development\nplanning  process  aimed  at  improved  identification  of  and  resource  allocation  for  local\ndevelopment needs. The process will be based on participatory approaches whereby villagers\nthemselves will have the opportunity to identify local problems and propose solutions, organize\nthemselves to implement those solutions, and monitor the results. The Project will thus lay the\ngroundwork for local government and communities to institute socially inclusive mechanisms\nthrough which they can have a voice and choice in decision making concerning how public\nresources will be used for their benefit. Past initiatives with similar objectives have failed for lack\nof such local institutional capacity and mechanisms.\n39. The second set of challenges revolves around significant but not intractable constraints\nto rural economic growth opportunities for the poor in Kalimantan and Sulawesi, caused by the\nexclusion  of  rural  communities  from  regional  growth  centers  (i.e.,  markets),  from  financial\nservices, and from information necessary to actually access those markets. For lack of capital,\nmany poor villagers who wish to engage in off-farm income-generation activities are unable to\ndo so. The feasibility study identified 48 types of microenterprises that villagers would like to\ninvest in if they had access to affordable credit. Through the development planning process to\nbe supported under the Project, communities will be encouraged to invest in microenterprises\nand provided access to formal financial services after raising capital from their savings. Many\nareas and village communities lack access roads and other rural infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\njetties, and markets) to establish commercial linkages to regional centers and benefit from\nspillover effects of their growth. The Project will support construction of rural infrastructure that", "13\nwill improve the commercial links between the target villages and the growth centers in the\nproject area.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n1.  Objectives\n40.  By addressing a range of social exclusion issues that lead to capability deprivation\namong the poor, the Project aims to increase the real incomes of the poor, particularly the\npoorer rural communities in the peripheral areas of regional growth centers. The objectives of\nthe Project are to (i) empower rural communities by strengthening their capacity to plan and\nmanage  their  own  development  activities  in  a  socially  inclusive  manner,  and  (ii)  support\ninvestments  and  foster  rural  urban  linkages  by  establishing  rural  infrastructure  to  promote\nagricultural productivity and off-farm business enterprises.\n2.  Scope\n41.  The Project will comprise four components:\na. Capacity Building for Decentralized Development Planning (Part A)\n42. Part A seeks to empower communities and strengthen the capacity of village and local\nofficials under a decentralized framework. It will support capacity building for communities and\ncommunity institutions, local government workers (district, subdistrict, and village levels), and\nnational and provincial officials to develop new skills, that they will need to function effectively\nunder the new administrative and financial setup for the decentralized government system.\nEmpowerment will be achieved through the following subcomponents:\n(i)  Institutional  development.  This  subcomponent  will  (a)  introduce  a  planning\nprocess and related training and other institutional capacity-building activities to\nencourage and help communities to develop and test community-based planning\nmechanisms and to formulate and propose village development plans for funding\nby  project  implementation  units  (PIUs);  (b)  establish  intervillage  community\ndevelopment working groups (Kelompok Kerja Pembangunan Masyarakat) to\nfacilitate and advocate development proposals promoting linkage of neighboring\nvillages  that  require  PIU  funding  support; and  (c)  skills  training  for  local\ngovernment staff to enhance their capability to facilitate, monitor, and support\nlocal community development initiatives.\n(ii)  Human resources development. This subcomponent will support formal degree\ntraining for 1,773 staff of DGRCE and local government dealing with community\ndevelopment, including those at district and subdistrict levels, to form a nucleus\nof skilled staff dealing with decentralized development planning. The proportion\nof women trained will be at least 30 percent of the total for the diploma, 25\npercent for the bachelor\u2019s degree program, and 20 percent for the master\u2019s\ndegree program. The domestic master\u2019s degree program includes specialization\nin  rural  development  planning,  rural  community  development,  and  public\nadministration, while the international master\u2019s degree program includes social\nplanning and development, and development management. DGRCE will ensure\nthat  staff  who  have  participated  in  the  formal  domestic  and  foreign  degree\ntraining programs will be assigned to a Project position relevant to the training,\nfor at least twice the length of the period of the training received. About 90", "14\nofficials  will  conduct  a  short-term  comparative  study  of  decentralization,\ncommunity  and  village  planning,  CBSLO  formation,  and  microenterprise\ndevelopment in other countries of the region (Appendix 2).\n(iii)  Provision  of  village  grants  to  support  the  community  training  program.  This\nsubcomponent will provide a one-time village grant to each community after\nsuccessfully developing a village plan, at the end of the capacity building training\nprogram  (para.  42  [i]).  The  grant  will  finance  a  specific  rural  infrastructure\nproposal  identified  in  the  village  plans  and  approved  by  the  elected  village\ncouncil.23 The grant (about Rp65 million or $7,800 per village) will include a\nportion (about 7.5 percent) to cover administration costs related to the village\ndevelopment  planning  process.  Construction  will  be  fully  undertaken  with\nvillagers labor, while the materials will be purchased by the PIUs.\nb.  Development of Rural Financial Institutions (Part B)\n43. Part B will support the formation of savings and loan organizations, support investments,\nand promote economic growth in poor rural communities. This will be done through the following\nsubcomponents:\n(i)  Development of community-based savings and loan organizations. The Project\nwill encourage interested members of the community during the CBSLO training\nprogram to form CBSLOs to mobilize savings, provide financial services among\nmembers,  and  manage  small  loans  under  the  Project  for  the  enterprise\ninvestments.  The  formation  process  will  involve  extensive  discussions  and\nanalysis of the need for financial services and intensive training for members and\nofficers on their responsibilities. Officers will be elected from among the members\nand trained to prepare simple annual profit and loss statements. CBSLOs will be\nrequired to register as legal entities. If participants are interested, CBSLOs can\nbe formed in about 750 participating villages. Many key participants will assist in\nforming the 750 CBSLOs separately. A total of 36 subdistricts, representing 11\ndistricts,  will  be  involved.  Each  subdistrict  will  be  allowed  to  form  only  six\nCBSLOs a year. For some, that will mean forming 18 CBSLOs for a three-year\nperiod, and for others, forming 24 CBSLOs for a four-year period.\n(ii) Providing financial services. Following the formation of CBSLOs, savings will be\nmobilized and lending among members will be encouraged to raise the capital\nbase of CBSLOs to support economic activities in the community. Each CBSLO\nwill  serve  as  the  new  focal  point  for  providing  needed  financial  services  to\nmembers of the village, which is lacking at present. About $15.0 million24 from\nthe ordinary capital resources loan proceeds will be relent by the Ministry of\nFinance (MOF) to six BPDs, which will serve as executing banks for the credit.\nCapacity  building  for  BPDs  will  be  provided  to  strengthen  their  capability  to\nprovide microfinance services to approximately 750 target villages. BPD staff will\nassist the team of NGO facilitators in training of CBSLO officers and members\npreparatory to actual borrowing. A BPD will onlend to a CBSLO which will then\n                                                \n23  As provided by Law 22.\n24 The feasibility study consultants have calculated the demand for credit based on the estimated number of CBSLOs\nto be formed under the Project. If each of the 750 CBSLOs would have at least 100 members, there would be\n75,000 potential borrowers. On a conservative estimate, if each member borrows a minimum of $200 once\n(equivalent  to  the  loan  size  targeted  for  the  poor  borrowers),  a  $15  million  credit  line  (75,000  x  $200  =\n$15,000,000) will be required.", "15\nonlend to its members at market rates. Each BPD will onlend the proceeds of\neach withdrawal to eligible CBSLOs within three months of such withdrawal. In\nthe event of full repayment by CBSLOs, the BPD will onlend the proceeds of\nsuch repayment to other eligible CBSLOs, and will continue to do so for at least\ntwo years after project completion.\nc.  Improvement of Rural Infrastructure (Part C)\n44. Part  C  will  provide  needed  rural  infrastructure  in  the  project  area  to  link  poor\ncommunities to markets in the urban centers. The rural infrastructure will increase access to\nmarkets and services and reduce the disproportionately high transaction costs faced by poor\nfarmers  and  small  entrepreneurs.  It  will  support  and  invigorate  agricultural  production  and\nmicroenterprises in the less developed rural areas. The infrastructure facilities will be selected\nusing a participatory approach that considers the needs of the villages or the common good for\nvillage  clusters.  Civil  works  to  be  constructed  or  rehabilitated  will  range  from  simple\ninfrastructure that can be carried out by the community to more complex infrastructure requiring\nheavy  equipment  and  the  services  of  licensed  construction  contractors.  The  latter  type  of\ninfrastructure will require the services of district government public works officials and the PIUs\nfor investigations, survey, design, and technical specifications. In all cases, labor from the\nparticipating  villages  will  be  utilized  to  generate  employment  and  strengthen  the  skills  of\nbeneficiaries in the operation and maintenance (O&M) of completed infrastructure. Under a\nmemorandum of agreement between each village and the PIU, routine maintenance of all\ncompleted infrastructure will be done by villagers. Examples of infrastructure are access and on-\nfarm  roads,  bridges  and  jetties,  fish  auction  and  village  markets,  rural  water  supply,  and\ndrainage to control flooding (Appendix 3).\nd. Project Management and Monitoring (Part D)\n45. Part  D  will  provide  administrative  support,  technical  guidance,  and  monitoring  and\nsupervision related to project implementation, including establishment of a project performance\nmonitoring  system  (PPMS)  and  use  of  consultants  and  NGO  facilitators  and  NGO  district\nmonitors for selected project activities. The PPMS will (i) monitor and evaluate project activities,\nincluding assessment of poverty reduction and social, environmental, financial, and economic\nimpacts; (ii) develop a computerized management information system (MIS) to assist in day-to-\nday  management  of  project  activities;  and  (iii)  conduct  regular  monitoring  and  evaluation\nreviews. Three management teams will be formed at the project management office (PMO):\n(i) one team will provide guidance on overall management, monitoring and evaluation, and\ntraining activity in an advisory capacity to project management and will establish the PPMS and\nMIS; (ii) a second team will provide guidance and support for implementing capacity building\nunder part A; and (iii) a third team will provide guidance and support in forming CBSLOs and\ndeveloping micro enterprises development under part B and supervising construction under part\nC.  District  NGO  monitors  will  also  be  engaged  for  oversight  activities  under  part  D,  e.g.,\nreviewing procurement and assessing quality and standard of construction.\n3.  Project Area\na. Provinces, Districts, Subdistricts, and Villages\n \n46. The  four  project  components  will  be  fully  implemented  in  11  districts  in  six  core\nprovinces in eastern Indonesia: Central Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, and South Kalimantan,\nand Central Sulawesi, North Sulawesi, and Southeast Sulawesi (map, page vi). However, part A", "16\ncomprising capacity building for decentralized development planning, will first be pilot-tested in\nthe  six  provinces.  During  this  period,  the  community-based  planning  mechanism  and  the\ntraining program will be developed and tested. Following a midterm evaluation three years after\nthe  start  of  implementation,  the  geographic  coverage  of  part  A  may  be  extended  to  the\nremaining 20 provinces that show commitment, on a voluntary basis. These provinces, which\nhave been designated as expansion provinces, would benefit from the experience and lessons\nlearned in conducting village training in the six core provinces.\n47. At project formulation which began in 1998, the assistance of the World Bank and JBIC\nwas concentrated on the islands of Java, Bali, and Sumatra, and was aimed at reducing poverty\nby constructing or rehabilitating rural infrastructure in the rural areas, such as roads, and water\nsupply and sanitation facilities. To avoid duplication of efforts and overlaps, the Government and\nADB agreed that the proposed Project would focus its assistance on the outer islands of\nSulawesi and Kalimantan. In this manner, the Project would also support the Government\u2019s\npolicy  of  promoting  balanced  regional  development  by  focusing  assistance  on  the  less\ndeveloped eastern region and reducing poverty. Because by 1998 the World Bank and JBIC\ncoverage had extended even to Sulawesi and Kalimantan, it was agreed that only subdistricts\nthat were not covered by the other aid agencies would be selected for the Project.\n48. The rural infrastructure component of the Project follows the strategy of linking poor\nvillages to growth centers and growth corridors to access markets in these areas. Growth\ncenters are towns and cities where above-average growth has taken place in recent years.\nGrowth corridors comprise long sections of main roads linking subdistricts to growth centers and\nalong which some villages develop economic activities. Examples of growth corridors are the\nmain road connecting Banjarmasin to Kapuas and Barito, and the main road connecting Palu\nand Poso. Using rapid rural appraisal and SUSENAS25 data, 72 subdistricts were selected on\nthe following criteria: (i) contain at least 1,500 households, (ii) contain IDT villages to reach the\nlargest number of poor people, (iii) possess potential linkage to regional growth centers and\ngrowth corridors, (iv) have moderate year-round accessibility, and (v) avoid overlap by not\nparticipating in the World Bank and JBIC rural infrastructure projects.\n49. The following criteria will be used to target poor villages. To be eligible, a village will (i)\nnot  be  covered  by  ongoing  foreign-assisted  projects  involving  microfinance  or  rural\ninfrastructure during the project implementation period; (ii) be in a cluster of about 3-10 villages\nand within a reasonable distance from a growth center; (iii) have an existing commercial link to\ngrowth centers, including at least 10 percent of households with commercial activities selling\ngoods or services at such growth centers; and (iv) be in the bottom third of the participating\nsubdistrict in terms of proportion of poor. To select the villages, workshops will be conducted at\nthe subdistrict level involving PIU staff, NGOs, village chiefs, and community representatives\nfrom village dusun (village subunits or settlements). Details of the overall strategy for targeting\nthe poor are described in paras. 88 and 89.\nb.  Community Empowerment\n50. Capacity building for the villages under part A is aimed at community empowerment,\nwhich is a long-term process. Under this Project, several strategies will be used to empower\nvillage  communities,  especially  the  poor:  group  formation,  social  mobilization,  human\ndevelopment  training,  and  village-level  planning  through  the  participatory  approach.\nCommunities are not homogeneous and to ensure the participation of women and men in the\nvillage development planning process, groups will be formed in each dusun comprising people\n                                                \n25 National socioeconomic survey.", "17\nfrom  similar  socioeconomic  background  and  by  gender.  The  process  of  community\nempowerment starts with social mobilization, followed by human development training and\nvillage planning. Each village will make its own development plan based on its perceived needs.\nEach group will conduct a situation analysis and participatory appraisal. The outputs will be\ncombined to develop a village plan and village map. The village plan will contain, among others,\nthe schedule for constructing or rehabilitating village infrastructure prioritized over a period of\ntime. A detailed social assessment of the Project is provided in the supplementary appendix.\nc. Targeting Poor People\n51. The Project will target poor households with annual income of less than Rp670,000\n($100). The rapid rural appraisal conducted during the feasibility study have identified poor\nhouseholds that can afford only two meals a day; whose members are landless, sharecroppers,\nfisherfolks without boats; are headed by women; and are involved in subsistence farming, and\nsmall  trading  and  selling  of  home-cooked  food  and  beverages.  A  survey  of  potential\nbeneficiaries in the six provinces indicated that at least two thirds of the population are very poor\nand  poor.  On  the  two  islands,  the  typical  family  depends  on  subsistence  agriculture.  In\nKalimantan, the typical family has a bicycle to take produce to the market and to serve the\ntransport needs of the members. The house is made of wood with a wooden floor but is poorly\nmaintained. Many houses have a pressed earthen floor. Many families use firewood for cooking\nand have access to a sealed well and pump for potable water, although the majority in the same\nvillage have only open wells. In Sulawesi, the typical family also relies on subsistence farming,\nbut earns supplementary income from handicrafts made at home. The house is traditionally\nraised above the ground and is made of timber. The house has wooden-slat windows. Firewood\nis also used extensively for cooking, and a kerosene stove is for special occasions. There are\npumps in the village, but the family uses an open well for drinking water.\n52. The following strategy will be used in targeting poor households:26 (i) villages with a\nmajority of poor people will be targeted; (ii); village development plans will explicitly identify the\nneeds and concerns of poor people; (iii) village planning committees will include at least two\nrepresentatives of the poor; (iv) to allow participation of poor people with low literacy, two thirds\nof the trainees in the community training program to be designed will be from poor households;\n(v) two thirds of the total borrowers from the CBSLOs will be from poor households; (vi) no\nminimum savings levels will be established in opening a CBSLO savings account to avoid\nexcluding the poor; (vii) CBSLO lending terms and repayment period will be set at sufficiently\nlow levels to allow poor borrowers to gain experience in using credit (the CBSLO will set the\nlevel and repayment period as an explicit part of the membership guidelines to encourage the\nparticipation of the poor); (viii) proposals for rural infrastructure projects under part C will include\nan explanation of the benefit for the poor; and (ix) poverty impact indicators are included in the\nbaseline surveys and in the MIS under the Project to provide data for monitoring and targeting\nthe participation of the poor in project activities.\nd. Targeting the Full Participation of Women\n53. The following strategy will be used in targeting the full participation of women under the\nProject: (i) organize women into separate groups to (a) ensure their active participation, (b)\nprovide them with a forum to discuss issues related to their economic activities and livelihood,\nand (c) address their special needs; (ii) ensure that women comprise at least half of the\n                                                \n26 Poor households will be mobilized to form groups in each dusun: one group for women and another for men. Social\nmobilization and human development training will follow to ensure their participation in the village development\nplanning process.", "18\nparticipants  in  the  community  training  and  at  least  half  of  the  participants  in  the  CBSLO\nformation and microenterprise training; (iii) ensure that women comprise at least half of the total\nCBSLO members; (iv) encourage women to run for CBSLO and Kelompok Kerja Pembangunan\nMasyarakat (KKPM) elective offices; (v) promote women\u2019s participation in all aspects of CBSLO\noperations, including formulating lending policies; and (vi) ensure that each CBSLO will adopt\nspecial measures to develop loan products that address the demands of women entrepreneurs\nand poor women. A separate strategy will be used to target the increased participation of\nwomen at the village and local government levels and through the use of NGO facilitators: (i)\nencourage women to apply for vacant government staff positions in the project area; (ii) provide\nformal training for DGRCE staff, with women comprising at least 30 percent of the diploma-level\ntrainees, 25 percent of the undergraduate trainees, and 20 percent of the graduate trainees; (iii)\nensure that village planning committees will include at least two women representatives; and (iv)\nensure that half of the NGO facilitators to be employed in the Project are women.\nC.  Cost Estimates\n54. The total cost of the Project over six years is estimated at $170.2 million equivalent,\nincluding physical and price contingencies, interest during construction, taxes, and duties. Of\nthe total cost, $45.5 million or 27 percent is the foreign exchange cost and $124.7 million\nequivalent or 73 percent is the local currency cost. A summary of the cost estimates is in Table\n1 and detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 4.\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency  Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n55. Considering  Indonesia\u2019s  economic  difficulties  and  fiscal  constraints  in  the  short  to\nmedium term, the Government requested that, as an interim measure, ADB\u2019s share in project\nfinancing  be  increased  to  80  percent  of  the  project  cost.  Although  Indonesia\u2019s  economic\nrecovery is continuing, the economic situation remains difficult. Public debt has ballooned to\nabout 93 percent of gross domestic product, excluding the Government\u2019s contingent liabilities.\nConsequently, the Government\u2019s debt service burden has risen sharply. Given the anticipated\ntightness in the fiscal situation, the Government expressed its difficulty, at least in the short run,\nin providing 40 percent share of the cost in project financing from its budgetary sources. The\nWorld Bank currently provides 75 percent of project costs on a three-year rolling average and a\nfurther  increase  in  its  share  is  understood  to  be  under  World  Bank\u2019s  consideration.  JBIC\ncurrently provides about 85 percent of project costs. Under these circumstances, it is proposed\nthat ADB\u2019s share of the project cost be increased to 80 percent for the first three years of project\nimplementation and revert to 60 percent after the third year. The temporary relaxation of ADB\u2019s\ncost-sharing limit for project financing is being sought as a purely temporary measure to assist\nIndonesia tide over its fiscal difficulties and to support Indonesia\u2019s incipient economic recovery.\nA similar financing arrangement is being proposed for all project loans for Indonesia to be\nconsidered by the Board in 2000. This proposal is in accordance with the graduation policy,\nwhich  allows  ADB  financing  to  exceed  the  country  cost-sharing  limit  under  exceptional\ncircumstances and where justified on country and project grounds (para. 86). 27\n56. It is proposed that ADB provide two loans comprising  (i) the loan in various currencies\nequivalent to Special Drawing Rights 38,752,000 from its Special Funds resources (SFR), with\nan amortization period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge\nat the rate of 1 percent during the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter,28 and (ii) the loan of\n$65 million equivalent from its ordinary capital resources (OCR), with interest to be determined\nin accordance with the ADB pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans, with a\nmaturity of 25 years, including a grace period of 6 years, a front-end fee of 1 percent of the OCR\nloan amount, and an annual commitment charge of 0.75 percent. The proposed ADB loans\nconstitute 68 percent of the total project cost and will collectively finance the foreign exchange\ncost of $45.5 million and a part of the local currency cost of up to $69.5 million equivalent. The\nBorrower will be the Republic of Indonesia. The Government will finance the remaining cost of\nthe Project amounting to about $55.2 million or 32 percent of the total project costs. A summary\nof the financing plan is in Table 2.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percent\nAsian Development Bank\n    Ordinary Capital Resources 27.3 37.7 65.0\n    Asian Development Fund 18.2 31.8 50.0\n        Total 45.5 69.5 115.0 68\nGovernment    0.0 55.2 55.2 32\n             Total 45.5 124.7 170.2 100\n                                                \n27  R204-98: A Graduation Policy for the Bank, 23 November.\n28  Unlike OCR funds, Special Funds resources have no commitment charge and no front-end fee.", "20\n57. The provision of SFR to the Project is justified in view of the very strong focus on\nreducing poverty in rural areas and its significant support for the Government\u2018s major efforts on\ncapacity building to ensure the smooth transfer of administrative and fiscal responsibilities from\nthe Central level to local governments. The SFR will be used to support investment in process-\noriented activities that involve a broad spectrum of local government and village participants in\npreparing  and  implementing  village  development  plans,  and  in  developing  the  capacity  of\ncommunities to decide on the use of local funds for local-level development. These features will\nensure  that  Project-funded  activities  will  be  demand-driven  with  strong  ownership  by  local\ncommunities.\nE. The Executing Agency\n58. The  Directorate  General  of  Rural  Community  Empowerment  will  be  the  Executing\nAgency. Its role under the Project is consistent with its new mission under the decentralization\nframework to support and facilitate community development planning and coordinating with local\ngovernments and sector agencies in implementing economic growth programs.\n59. Six BPDs will serve as Implementing Agencies under the Project. Since they are taking\nfull credit risk for onlending project funds to CBSLOs, they are also referred to as Executing\nBanks.  Although  the  six  BPDs\u2019  experience  in  microcredit  activities  ranges  from  limited  to\nadequate, they are keen to participate in the Project in view of their changing role to actively\ndevelop financial services in the rural areas of their respective provinces. One of the six BPDs is\na participant in the ADB-assisted Microcredit Project and has gained experience in providing\nwholesale credit to nonbank financial institutions, which in turn onlend funds to members, an\narrangement similar to that proposed for CBSLOs and its members cum borrowers.\nF. Implementation Arrangements\n  1. Project Organization and Coordination\n \n60. The  key  implementation  responsibility  under  the  Project  will  devolve  to  the  district\ngovernment as required by the decentralization laws. Within one month of loan effectiveness,\neach district will establish a PIU for day-to-day management of the Project. The project manager\nat each PIU will be appointed by the district chief (BUPATI).  Each district will establish a district\nadvisory group (DAG) within three months of loan effectiveness, to provide advice on measures\nfor addressing issues affecting timely implementation of the Project. Each DAG will be chaired\nby the district chief and will have the following as members: the chairperson of the district\nparliament concerned and representatives from the district planning agency, selected district\ntechnical  support  agencies  (agriculture,  fisheries,  livestock,  trade  and  industry,  etc.),  BPD,\ndistrict women\u2019s group, and local credit unions.\n61. Each province will appoint a provincial project manager to provide support and advice to\nthe participating districts. Selection of the participating districts and subdistricts has aimed at\nlinking clusters of poor rural communities to markets located at the nearby urban areas or\ngrowth centers. Each participating province will establish a provincial coordination office (PCO),\nwithin one month of loan effectiveness, to serve primarily as a coordination center, for reporting\nfinancial and physical progress coming from a number of districts, and for backstopping the\nproject activities of the local governments. Within three months of loan effectiveness, each\nparticipating province will establish a provincial advisory group (PAG) to be chaired by the\ngovernor  of  the  province  and  will  comprise  the  following:  chairperson  of  the  provincial\nparliament,  the  head  of  the  provincial  planning  agency  (BAPPEDA),  heads  of  provincial", "21\ntechnical  support  agencies  (agriculture,  fisheries,  livestock,  trade  and  industry,  etc.),  and\nrepresentatives of concerned BPDs, women\u2019s groups, and local credit unions.  Each PAG will\nadvise  on  strengthening  selected  agencies  to  provide  support  for  project  activities  in\nparticipating provinces and districts, and on issues relating to project coordination. The DAGs\nand PAGs will meet as necessary and at least once every three months.\n62. Under  the  decentralization  framework,  DGRCE  needs  to  strengthen  its  institutional\ncapacity  to  serve  in  its  new  role  and  function  to  facilitate  and  monitor  the  progress  of\nimplementation of a decentralized and village demand-driven Project.  With the day-to-day\nmanagement  of  the  Project  devolved  to  the  district  governments,  DGRCE  will  need  to\nstrengthen its own capability to establish and implement an effective monitoring and evaluation\nsystem. It will establish a project management office (PMO) in Jakarta, within one month of loan\neffectiveness. The PMO will be responsible for overall coordination and administration of project\nactivities, particularly for (i) submission to ADB of consolidated progress reports and other\nreports submitted by each PCO and PIU; and (ii) timely submission to ADB of unaudited and\naudited accounts of the Project. The PMO will be headed by a full-time senior officer as project\nmanager, who will be assisted by two full-time assistant PMO project managers (APPMs), one\nAPPM to facilitate the implementation of part A of the Project and another APPM to facilitate the\nimplementation of part B and part C. The two APPMs will be assisted by two specialized teams,\ncomprising DGRCE staff,29 consultants, and NGO facilitators \u2013 one team for implementing part\nA and another for implementing part B and part C. To provide full liaison and coordination with\nall  national  agencies  and  departments  participating  in  the  Project,  a  national-level  project\nsteering committee (PSC) will be formed, within three months of loan effectiveness. The director\ngeneral  of  DGRCE  will  chair  the  PSC  and  will  include  as  members  representatives  from\nBAPPENAS; the ministries of finance, agriculture, industry and trade and cooperatives, the\nCredit Union Federation of Indonesia, and as appropriate, local governments. The PSC will\naddress and resolve major policy issues affecting the Project and will formulate strategies for\nproject implementation (Appendix 5).\n2.  Regional Development Banks\n63. Six BPDs will serve as Executing Banks30 and will implement the credit subcomponent of\nthe Project to support CBSLO microenterprise development under part B (ii). These banks had\nbeen  set  up  in  each  province  between  1961  and  1965  to  promote  regional  development,\nincrease regional incomes, and help develop rural institutions. In 1967, BPDs were allowed to\naccept demand deposits, grant short-term loans, and participate in equity investments. BPDs\nare owned by provincial and district governments. The Appraisal Mission assessed the financial\nconditions of the six BPDs, for 1995 to 1999, based on five sets of financial indicators using\nCAMEL rating.31 The results indicate that all the BPDs have \u201csatisfactory\u201d CAMEL ratings,\nexcept for BPD Central Sulawesi (BPDCS) and BPD North Sulawesi (BPDNS), which were\nrated  \u201cless  than  satisfactory\u201d.  However,  after  BPDNS  was  recapitalized  and  underwent\nstructural changes in 1999, it was rated \u201csatisfactory\u201d at end-1999. Bank Indonesia (BI), which\nalso supervises the performance of the BPDs, had rated all the BPDs in March 2000 as\n\u201csatisfactory,\u201d except for BPDCS, which received \u201cless than satisfactory\u201d because of its high\nnonperforming loan (NPL) ratio (Appendix 6).\n                                                \n29 PMO staff should include a financial management specialist and a procurement specialist.\n30 The term refers to banks taking full risk in repaying credit relent to them by MOF for onlending to subborrowers.\n31 C = capital adequacy, A = asset quality, M = management, E = earning history, and L = liquidity. C is based on\ncapital adequacy ratio; A, on productive asset ratio and provision for loan loss; M, on operational efficiency and\nother qualitative aspects of management; E, on return on assets and return on equity; and L, on net interbank ratio\nand loan-to-deposit ratio. There are four CAMEL ratings: good, satisfactory, less than satisfactory, and poor.", "22\n64. BI informed the Mission that considering the above rating, it conducted a \u201cfit and proper\ntest\u201d of senior officers and operational procedures of BPDCS. BPDCS received a passing mark,\nindicating that it has an acceptable set of officers and acceptable operations. BI and BPDCS\nagreed on measures (improved collection and writing off bad loans) to reduce the amount of its\nNPLs in one year to improve its BI rating. This satisfactory rating is a precondition before MOF\ncan relend ADB loan funds to BPDCS. The Mission examined the future financial viability of the\nsix BPDs by conducting financial projections based on CAMEL rating for 2001\u20132006. The\nassumptions used are presented in detail in Appendix 6. The results indicate that all the BPDs\nwould continue to have long-term viability, including BPDCS. BPDCS will improve its CAMEL\nrating from \u201cless than satisfactory\u201d to \u201csatisfactory\u201d by year 2002 when the loan disbursement to\nCBSLOs is expected to take place. The Mission concluded that all six BPDs are qualified to\nparticipate in the Project as Executing Banks.\n3.  Relending and Onlending Terms\n65. The Borrower would relend part of the ADB funds to the BPDs under a subsidiary loan\nagreement under the following terms and conditions: (i) an amortization period of 10 years,\nincluding a grace period of 3 years; and (ii) an interest rate of not less than the reference rate\n(defined  as  the  average  rate  of  interest  prevailing  for  90-day  rupiah-denominated  Bank\nIndonesia  Certificate  [SBI]  over  the  most  recent  three  months).  The  interest  rate  will  be\nreviewed annually by ADB and the Government. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the\nBorrower. Each BPD will onlend the funds (taking the credit risk) to qualified CBSLOs that have\nregistered as a legal entity and fulfilled other conditions as required by the BPD, under an\nonlending agreement between the BPD and each CBSLO. The CBSLOs will lend the funds to\ntheir members under a subborrower agreement between the CBSLO and the borrower.\n66. The  BPD  will  onlend  to  CBSLOs  under  the  following  terms  and  conditions:  (i)  an\namortization period of up to two years, including a grace period of three months; and (ii) an\ninterest rate of not less than the interest rate payable by BPD under the relevant subsidiary loan\nagreement plus a maximum of 8 percent margin. Currently, the interest rate is about 20 percent,\nwhich is considered sufficient to cover the credit risk and operational expenses. The interest\nrate charged by CBSLOs to their borrowing members would be set by the members themselves,\nbut would probably be 30\u201333 percent approximating the market rates prevailing in the project\narea (Appendix 7). This is considered sufficient to allow CBSLOs to accumulate capital. The\ncredit risk associated with defaults by individual CBSLO members would accrue to the CBSLO,\nwhile the credit risk arising from a CBSLO default would accrue to the BPD concerned. After\nsuccessful repayment, CBSLOs can seek additional loans from the BPDs.\n4. Implementation Schedule\n67. The  proposed  Project  will  be  implemented  over  six  years  from  January  2001.  An\nindicative implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. The two training programs, each for six\nmonths, can be conducted in the same village in sequence. The first training program will\ninvolve capacity building training (under part A) for the whole village. After the first two months,\nthe community will be able to identify the constraints they face in increasing income, their\nneeds, and a list of profitable community microenterprises for the urban markets. At this time,\nthe second training program to form CBSLOs under part B of the Project starts, involving\ninterested members most of whom are microentrepreneurs. Interest will widen since part B will\naddress their need for credit to support their livelihood and microenterprise activities. Within\neight months, one cycle of training, involving capacity building and CBSLO establishment, will\nhave been completed. Villages that successfully complete part A training are eligible to receive\nthe village grant (amounting to $7,800) enabling the community to implement by themselves", "23\none  of  the  simple  rural  infrastructure  projects  (e.g.,  rehabilitation  of  an  access  road)  they\nidentified in their village development plan. Subsequently, eligible villages will be assisted to\nconstruct medium to large civil works (Types I and II) described in Appendix 3. In the second\nyear of Project implementation, BPDs will provide credit for entrepreneurial activities to eligible\nCBSLOs, which have shown at least one year of sustained savings by members and a good\nrecord of lending to members using their own savings. Supervised by BPDs and PMD staff,\neach CBSLO will be required to prepare a profit and loss statement (PLS) annually and conduct\nannual meetings to elect officers and to discuss the PLS for transparency.\n5. Flow of Funds\n68. Under approved arrangements, project loan funds will flow directly from MOF to three\nlevels of management: the PMO in Jakarta, the PCO in the provincial capital, and the PIUs at\nthe district level. They will be provided as earmarked special funds allocation budgets. Funds for\nthe credit scheme of part B will be relent by MOF to the BPDs in six provinces for onlending to\nCBSLOs. The flow of funds from MOF to the BPDs will be governed by a subsidiary loan\nagreement  between  MOF  and  each  BPD  under  terms  and  conditions  acceptable  to  ADB\n(Appendix  9).  The  Government  provided  assurances  that  the  provision  of  funds  from  the\nproceeds of the loans, and the corresponding counterpart contributions necessary for financing\nProject  activities  would  continue  throughout  Project  implementation  through  the  earmarked\nspecial funds allocation, notwithstanding (i) any reallocation of authority or responsibility for\nchanneling of external assistance, and for provision of corresponding counterpart contributions\nbetween the Central Government, the participating provinces, and the participating districts; or\n(ii)  any  requirement  for  provision  of  matching  counterpart  contributions  for  funding  project\nactivities from participating provinces or participating districts, arising from the implementation of\nthe provisions of Decentralization Laws 22 and 25.  The Government agreed to regularly update\nADB on the process of decentralization undertaken in accordance with the provisions of the\ndecentralization laws and any relevant implementation regulations issued, and to take into\naccount any views ADB expresses on them.32\n6. Procurement\n69. Civil works under the Project consist of construction or renovation of existing offices and\nconstruction of rural infrastructure \u2013 access roads, small bridges and box culverts, village\nmarkets and jetties \u2013 which are widely dispersed throughout the project area. Except for about\n11 civil works contract packages estimated to cost less than $500,000, the rest of the packages\nwill cost less than $100,000. Goods and services financed by ADB under the Project will be\nprocured in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. However, these contracts\n                                                \n32 The procedures and guidelines for Laws 22 and 25 have been developed and it is not necessary to link the design\nand implementation schedule of the Project to the full implementation of these two laws. The implementing\nregulations for Law 22 provide a detailed framework for distributing administrative functions between layers of\ngovernment. When enacted, the implementing regulations for Law 25, would elaborate the mechanisms and\ndistribution of revenues between different levels of government. The implementation of Law 25 may be directly\nrelevant to the Project to the extent that it envisages reallocation of fiscal responsibilities between the Central and\nregional  governments.  To  safeguard  the  Project  from  any  uncertainties  regarding  the  reallocation  of\nresponsibilities, the Government has provided specific assurances. Broadly, the Government accepted that any\nsuch reallocation would be internal to the Government without any impact on project implementation. Specific\nassurances regarding provision of counterpart funds and repayment of the ADB loan are in paras. 119 (i) and (ii).", "24\nare not likely to attract international contractors.33 Local contractors capable of undertaking such\nworks are available. Therefore, to ensure quality, the civil works contracts will be awarded on\nthe basis of local competitive bidding (LCB) among prequalified contractors in accordance with\nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB. The PIU in each participating district will submit to\nADB the first set of draft LCB documents for prior review and approval before advertising for the\nrelevant contract. Furthermore, each of the 11 district PIUs will submit to ADB the first two LCB\ncontracts  for  prior  approval:  (i)  the  proposed  prequalification  documentation,  and  (ii)  the\nproposal for award of contract. ADB will be furnished with three copies of (i) an account of the\npublic opening of bids, (ii) a summary and evaluation of the bids, (iii) the proposal for award,\nand (iv) a draft contract or a draft letter of acceptance. Promptly after award of each contract,\nADB will be furnished with three copies of the contract as executed. ADB will have the right to\nreview the documentation of any contract awarded under LCB procedures and to refuse to\nfinance such a contract if it concludes that prequalification of the contractor or award of the\ncontract is inconsistent with the Government procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. Civil\nworks for pathways, storage sheds, and similar structures estimated to cost the equivalent of\n$50,000 or less may involve the participation of local communities and will be awarded in\naccordance with procedures to be agreed upon between the PIU and the community concerned,\nand acceptable to ADB.\n70. Utility vehicles, motorcycles, computers, and other office equipment will be purchased by\nthe PMO, PCOs, and PIUs in their respective locations in Jakarta, and the provincial or district\ncapitals. Purchase of vehicles and motorcycles will depend on the availability of motor outlets\nand service centers, either in the district or at the provincial capital. Depending on the total cost\nof the package, about 91 vehicles and 304 motorcycles will be purchased through international\nshopping for contracts below $500,000, or direct purchase for contracts valued at less than\n$100,000. Indicative contract packages and procurement modes for major goods and services\nare shown in Appendix 10.\n7.  Consulting Services\n71. Consulting services will provide the needed expertise to assist in implementing the\nProject. International consulting firms, in association with domestic consulting firms, will be\nrecruited  based  on  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. A total of about 1,054 person-\nmonths of consulting services will be required: 236 (approximately 22 percent of the total)\ninternational, and 818  (approximately 78 percent of the total) domestic. The consulting services\nwill be divided into four packages, one package each for parts A, B, C, and D components.\nPackage 1 will comprise about 283 person-months of international and domestic consultants;\npackage 2, about 285; package 3, about 272; and package 4, about 214. The list of consultants\nrequired is in Appendix 11, while the outline terms of reference are in Appendix 12.\n72. The contracts for packages 1, 2, 3, and 4 will include provisions allowing consultants to\ncontract the services of NGO facilitators for capacity building training and forming CBSLOs in\ntargeted villages, subdistricts, and districts; and NGO field monitors for oversight activities at the\ndistrict level. NGO facilitators and NGO field monitors will be selected and engaged through\nsubcontract by the consultants concerned in accordance with competitive selection criteria and\n                                                \n33 Eleven districts in the six provinces will select 11 core subprojects to start implementation in the first two years. It is\nexpected that the core subprojects will include rehabilitation of road links and construction of bridges/box culverts\non those road links to move commerce and improve transportation links for general purposes. The roads will serve\nseveral villages and be connected to the commercial areas of rural and/or urban centers. The maximum length of\nroad would be about 2-3 km and would include 2-3 drainage crossings (bridges or box culverts).", "25\nprocedures acceptable to ADB, including prior review and approval of such selection criteria by\nADB. In addition, the PMO will invite universities or research institutions to bid for a number of\nstudies involving poverty monitoring and impact studies, and environmental studies\n8. Advance Action\n73. Advance action on the preparation of tender documents to reduce the time needed for\nengaging and fielding consultants for the Project is deemed essential to avoid any delays in\nproject  start-up.  The  Government  requested  ADB  approval  of  advance  action  in  selecting\nconsultants to enable the Government to invite proposals from consultants immediately after the\nProject is approved. Approval of advance action was given by Management at the Loan and\nTechnical Assistance Coordination Committee. The Mission has advised the Government that\nadvance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project. Advance action for engagement of\nconsultants will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n9. Operation and Maintenance\n74. Maintenance  will  be  required  for  all  rural  infrastructure  subprojects,  including  those\nconstructed with grant funds from part A. Routine maintenance will be carried out by the villages\nconcerned, using a memorandum of agreement between the PIU and the concerned village\norganizations. Most of the maintenance will involve spreading gravel and repairing potholes in\nroad surfaces, painting, cutting grass/weeds, trimming trees, cleaning side ditches, placing\nculverts, etc. The Project will finance the cost of the materials for the village organizations based\non a survey of needs carried out by the rural infrastructure engineers and villagers, and deliver\nthe materials on an as-needed basis. The recurrent costs for O&M of civil works will be financed\nby the Project on a declining basis as follows: 100 percent in years 1 and 2, 80 percent in year\n3, 60 percent in year 4, 50 percent in year 5, and none starting year 6 and onward.\n10. Special Accounts\n75. To  expedite  the  disbursement  of  loan  proceeds,  the  Project  will  open  two  imprest\naccounts (special accounts), which will be established and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on Imprest Fund and Statement of Expenditures Procedures. At the request of the\nGovernment, ADB will deposit an initial amount not exceeding $1.5 million equivalent in an\nimprest account from the OCR loan funds, and will deposit into a second imprest account the\namount not exceeding $1.0 million from the ADF loan funds. Funds for the credit subcomponent\nunder part B of the Project will be drawn from time to time from the imprest account for OCR\nfunds. The statement of expenditures  (SOE) procedures will be used for reimbursing eligible\nexpenditures not exceeding $50,000 equivalent.\n11. Project Accounts, Audits, and Reports\n76. The PMO, PCOs, and PIUs will maintain records and accounts to identify goods and\nservices financed out of the loan proceeds and disclose the use thereof in the Project. The PMO\nwill have accounts and related financial statements for the various subcomponents, including\nspecial accounts and the statement of expenditures, audited annually, in accordance with sound\nauditing principles by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. It was agreed that a part of the\nloan funds amounting to about $100,000 would be used by the Government in selecting and\nengaging  the  services  of  qualified  independent  auditors  in  accordance  with  competitive\nselection procedures acceptable to ADB. This measure will ensure the timely submission of\naudited financial accounts to ADB. Certified copies of such audited accounts and the reports of\nthe auditors relating thereto will be submitted within nine months after the end of each fiscal", "26\nyear. The Mission reminded Government representatives and DGRCE of the new ADB policy on\nsubmission of audited accounts: a formal warning will be issued for accounts more than 6\nmonths overdue and disbursements will be suspended if the accounts are 12 months overdue.\nA framework for monthly reporting by electronic mail from the PMO to ADB using a format\nsimilar to ADB\u2019s project performance report will be established at inception. In addition, the\nPMO will prepare semiannual and annual progress reports during the implementation period, a\nmidterm  evaluation  report,  and  a  project  completion  report  three  months  after  project\ncompletion. The PMO will engage two teams of consultants to prepare the midterm report and\nthe project completion report.\n77. Each BPD will also maintain suitable subsidiary books and records to clearly indicate the\ndrawdowns from the line of credit from MOF and progress in utilization of the credit line,\ncovering onlending to CBSLOs and repayments or arrears of CBSLOs. The BPD will submit to\nthe PMO and ADB semiannual reports for joint reporting on the Project. The reports will include\nprogress made and problems encountered during the period under review, steps taken to\nremedy the problems, the proposed program including training for BPD staff and participation in\ntraining for CBSLO members, and expected disbursements during the following period. Each\nBPD will have its accounts and financial statements (balance sheets, statement of income and\nexpenses,  and  related  statements)  audited  annually,  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing\nstandards, by independent auditors acceptable to MOF and ADB. Certified copies of such\nreports and the reports of the auditors related thereto will be submitted within nine months after\nthe end of each fiscal year. Each BPD will also prepare annual progress reports, a midterm\nevaluation report, and a completion report three months after project completion. The domestic\nconsultants building the capacity of BPDs in microfinance will assist in preparing the outline of\nthe progress reports.\n78. To safeguard their continued satisfactory performance, the Government through Bank\nIndonesia  will regularly monitor the financial conditions of the six BPDs. It has been agreed that\nin the event any BPD fails to maintain a satisfactory rating for three consecutive months, the\nGovernment, through Bank Indonesia, will immediately review the operations of the concerned\nBPD, and in the meantime suspend any further disbursements under the relevant subsidiary\nloan agreements until remedial measures agreed upon by Bank Indonesia and the concerned\nBPD have been implemented.\n12. Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation\n79. An integrated system of data collection and analysis based on PPMS will be designed by\nconsultants and implemented to monitor progress in achieving the Project\u2019s objectives. The\nPPMS will provide the Government and ADB with the necessary data to monitor project inputs,\nactivities, outputs, and objective indicators as provided in the project framework; and to assess\nthe technical, social, environmental, financial, and economic aspects of the Project. The PPMS\nwill  also  provide  for  the  establishment  and  monitoring  of  a  computerized  management\ninformation system to assist in the day-to-day management of project activities. DGRCE will\nestablish the PPMS at its headquarters and maintain it after project completion.\n13.  Anticorruption Measures\n80. The Mission explained the ADB anticorruption policy, particularly the section on fraud\nand corruption, as stated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants. It was noted that effective project implementation encompasses all aspects of\nproject execution. In that regard, good governance practices and ethical standards are expected\nof all project staff, especially those involved in bidding and execution of contracts, and project-", "27\nfunded consultants and NGOs. The Project itself is designed to promote greater transparency,\naccountability, and direct participation of village-level beneficiaries, thus dramatically reducing\nopportunities for corruption.\n14. Midterm Review\n81. A comprehensive midterm review will be conducted at the end of year 3 of project\nimplementation to assess the progress of physical implementation of the various components:\ncivil  works  awards;  procurement  of  consulting  services,  vehicles,  and  equipment;  contract\nawards and disbursement projections; and to determine the need for any change in project\nscope. Specifically, the performance of capacity building and human resources development\nunder part A will be assessed to determine if geographic coverage may be extended from the\nsix core provinces to 20 new expansion provinces, that show commitment on a voluntary basis.\nThe review will also examine closely whether the targets set for the full participation of women,\nindigenous communities, and the poor are being met or not and whether upward revisions of the\ntargets are warranted. The review will also determine if both the geographic and individual\ntargeting mechanisms described are adequate to bring the proportion of poor beneficiaries to\ntwo thirds of the total project beneficiaries to achieve project objectives. A team of international\nconsultants will be engaged for two months to conduct the midterm review.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n82. The Project has minimal negative environmental impact and is rated as Category B\nbased on ADB\u2019s classification system. An initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared\nto assess two categories of activities likely to have potential environmental impact.\n83. The first relates to rural infrastructure construction. A screening of 24 typical types of\nproposed infrastructure construction indicates that only six types (involving Type 1 civil works)\nwarrant concerns about possible adverse but mitigable impacts. The most probable impacts\nwould be safety during construction, handling and rerouting of water, disposal of waste and\neffluent into waterways, and new road alignments that might traverse or skirt cemeteries or\nenvironmentally sensitive areas such as protected forests. For such activities, specific terms of\nreference will be included in the construction contracts to ensure that standard government\nenvironmental procedures (ANDAL) are followed and proper environmental mitigation measures\nare  incorporated  in  the  engineering  design.  The  Project  has  a  provisional  sum  in  the\nconsultants\u2019 contract  to permit contracting for environmental studies and services and engaging\nthe  appropriate  environment  specialists  to  prepare  terms  of  reference  for  such  contracts,\nconduct initial environmental impact evaluation, review proposals from contractors, and develop\nan environmental management and impact monitoring plan.\n84. The second category comprises 48 types of microenterprises that may be funded under\npart B. Most enterprises are handicrafts and home processing of food products, and individually\nare environmentally benign. Thirteen are assessed as having potential adverse environmental\nimpacts, with half having slight impacts. The concern is that a geographic concentration of these\ntypes of microenterprises \u2013 handicrafts and furniture production using raw materials from nearby\nforests \u2013 could, in the aggregate, generate negative or indirect environmental impacts. The\nProject will thus use the environmental studies contract for technical assistance to prepare\nguidelines to be used in the training program for CBSLOs and for the six BPDs to screen loan\nproposals  from  CBSLOs.  For  activities  with  possible  aggregate  effects,  the  guidelines  will\ninclude criteria to establish the basis for rejecting the proposals. A consultant will be engaged", "28\nsix months after the start of project implementation to prepare the environmental management\nand monitoring plan, which will be submitted to ADB for approval before any rural infrastructure\nand any microenterprise subprojects are approved.  The Government will ensure that any rural\ninfrastructure subprojects and entrepreneurial activities that have potentially significant adverse\nenvironmental impacts, as determined by an IEE, will be excluded from financing under the\nProject.\n2.  Social Analysis\n85. The Project is to be implemented in six provinces in various agroecological zones: from\nsettled agriculture in North Sulawesi to upland and sometimes swidden cultivation in Central\nSulawesi, mixed tree-crop farming in Southeast Sulawesi, and lowland river-based agriculture\nand aquaculture in South Kalimantan. This implies a large range of settlement patterns and\nproduction techniques.  The areas range from the mono-ethnic groups in North Sulawesi to the\ncomplex but established Christian and Muslim communities in Central Sulawesi, coastal Malays\nand riverine Dayaks in Kalimantan, a mix of old communities and new settlements in Southeast\nSulawesi, a receiving area of the overflow from the historically disaster-prone South Sulawesi.34\nThus, the project area is diverse in the nature of resources to be developed and in terms of\npeoples, what they do, and how they do it.\n86.  The districts have been selected because they are poor, and relatively isolated by virtue\nof distance, difficult geography, and poor infrastructure.  As a result of this isolation they have\nrelatively limited access to information about a range of subjects, from production technologies\nto prices.  In marketing they tend to be price takers, dependent on either the village trader or a\nfew  itinerant  buyers.  They  have  also  been  relatively  underserved  by  government  and\ndevelopment  projects  and  in  terms  of  basic  education  and  health  services.  Under\ndecentralization, their future access to basic services and development will depend on how well\nthey are able to articulate their needs and priorities to local government. The new situation will\nbe a significant departure from their experience to date, which has been largely as recipients of\nassistance that, from a local perspective, occurred at unpredictable times and of a type and\nquantity only loosely linked to local needs and conditions. Significant capacity building will be\nrequired to link these populations, not only economically but politically, to their local leaders and\ndecisions makers.\n87. The status of women and how they occupy their time differ across the project provinces\nand districts.  With the expansion of the education system in the provinces, the participation rate\nof girls and boys in basic education has increased. In some districts, Banjar in South Kalimantan\nand Donggala in Southeast Sulawesi, girls access to education is limited compared with that of\nboys. In other areas \u2013 Minahasa in North Sulawesi and Kendari in Southeast Sulawesi \u2013 the\nreverse is true and school participation rate of girls in junior secondary school is about 10\npercent higher than that of boys. But these are relatively late developments, since the 1990s,\nand therefore the majority of the adult female population is characterized by levels of education\nand levels of literacy lower than those of men. This, combined with other social cultural norms,\nimplies that women have far less access in economic and civil life than men. Nonetheless,\nwomen are active in the labor force.35 Their participation is significantly lower than the national\naverage in East Kalimantan and North Sulawesi implying that some cultural factors at work may\nbe keeping women at home. At the same time, the proportion of women seeking work in North\n                                                \n34 Southeast Sulawesi was originally a sparsely populated corner of South Sulawesi until it became a province of its\nown right in the 1960s; it has seen waves of in-migration in the wake of various calamities in South Sulawesi\nincluding famine, the last of which occurred in the 1970s.\n35 Labor force participation is the proportion of women who worked or desired to work in the reference period where\nwork is defined to include both formal and informal sectors and unpaid family labor.", "29\nSulawesi is well over the national average and indicates a high unmet demand for income-\ngenerating activities for women. In general, women are economically active in agriculture, food\nprocessing, crafts, and petty trade.\n88. The Project targets primarily the poor through a three-pronged strategy. The Project will\n(i)  help  the  poor  secure  their  livelihood  through  improved  infrastructure  and  microfinance\nservices, (ii) empower the poor in village economic and social life through village-level social\nmobilization, and (iii) influence the political process by increasing the capacity of local officials to\nrespond to the needs of the poor. The poor are selected through a combination of (i) geographic\ntargeting, and (ii) targeting of poor individuals in the community. Geographic targeting selects\nvillages with a poverty incidence of up to 58 percent, while individual targeting is used to\nincrease the proportion of the total number of poor beneficiaries to two thirds of the total\nbeneficiaries. The strategy for targeting the poor is elaborated in the supplementary appendix.\n89. Geographic targeting is accomplished by using the IDT classification of villages having\nlow levels of infrastructure, which is highly correlated with poverty, combined with the use of\nlocal knowledge-based criteria. Individual targeting is carried out by NGO village facilitators\nhired under the Project. The participation of the poor will be further ensured by using criteria\nfavoring their participation in the Project: (i) minimum representation of the poor on the village\nplanning  boards,  (ii)  inclusion  of  a  poverty  impact  assessment  to  be  carried  out  for  all\ninfrastructure  proposed  for  construction  under  the  Project  to  be  carried  out  by  the  NGO\nfacilitator, and (iii) incorporation of guidelines in the CBSLO charter for targeting poor members\nof the community. In this manner, the Project will increase the proportion of poor beneficiaries to\ntwo thirds of the total beneficiaries. Training the local government officials will increase the\nresponsiveness of local governments responsible for design and implementation of a poverty\nreduction  program  to  the  needs  of  the  poor.  The  construction  of  local  and  village-level\ninfrastructure will help raise the productivity of the poor. The formation of CBSLOs will fill the\nunmet need of the poor for access to savings facilities while enabling access to flexible credit\ndesigned for their needs.\n90. The Project seeks to empower women in the community\u2019s dialogue with Government to\nensure their views and needs are articulated and represented. This is done by promoting their\nparticipation in the development process and requiring a minimum level of representation of\nwomen in the village development councils. Experienced female NGO village facilitators will be\nhired.  In  the  government,  women  tend  to  be  underrepresented  at  decision-making  levels\nimplying gender bias or gender blindness in the development process. The Project will  assess\ngender balance in the Executing Agency and increase the pool of women eligible for promotion\nthrough the formal education training program. As women are economically active in the project\narea in a variety of activities ranging from small livestock to agriculture processing, handicrafts,\nand petty trade, bringing microfinance services closer to the village will enable them to save and\nborrow  more  securely,  and  hence,  increase  their  bargaining  power  while  reducing  their\ndependence on traditional moneylenders. The formation and training of CBSLOs will be such as\nto facilitate the participation of women. Training will be designed for people of low literacy levels.\nVillage facilitators will pay attention to promoting women\u2019s participation both as members and in\nCBSLO management. CBSLO member rules will be designed to be women friendly, and no\nminimum initial savings level that might prove to be a barrier to joining will be established.\nLending levels and terms will be sufficiently flexible to meet the needs of women who tend to be\nsmall entrepreneurs requiring small or short-term working capital.", "30\n H. Technical Assistance\n91. The  Government  noted  that  the  implementation  of  the  Project  and  the  two  new\ndecentralization laws would start simultaneously in January 2001. The need to upgrade and\nstrengthen the institutional capacity of the district and village governments was underscored to\nsimultaneously prepare and set up the administrative structures and monitoring arrangement for\naccountability and transparency related to their new responsibilities. At issue is the need to set\nup a system for disbursement and monitoring of project funds to facilitate compliance with the\nspecific  financial  monitoring  and  other  reporting  requirements  of  the  Project  and  the\nGovernment. The purpose of the TA is to assist the Executing Agency in developing a system of\ndisbursing, monitoring, and accounting of project funds in 11 districts in six provinces. The total\ncost of the TA is estimated at $1.4 million equivalent, of which $0.5 million will be the foreign\nexchange cost and $0.9 million equivalent will be the local currency cost. Of the total cost, the\nGovernment has requested that $1.1 million, comprising all the foreign exchange costs and $0.6\nmillion equivalent of the local currency costs, be financed by ADB on a grant basis from ACCSF,\nfunded by the Government of Japan. The grant financing of $1.1 million constitute 80 percent of\nthe total TA cost. The Government will finance $0.3 million equivalent or 20 percent of the total\nTA cost, mostly in kind. The grant was provided considering the strong focus of the TA on good\ngovernance and sound fiscal management in support of poverty reduction (Appendix 13).\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial and Economic Analyses\n92. The financial analysis focused mainly on the financial viability of representative livelihood\nenterprises  engaged  in  by  members  of  CBSLOs,  under  the  rural  financial  institutions\nsubcomponent in part B. This, in turn, served as the basis for determining the financial viability\nof the representative microenterprises under the Project. As it is difficult to quantify the benefits\nfrom capacity-building investments carried out under part A, the economic analysis was carried\nout only for part B taken as a whole. The analysis is based on the economic benefits derived\nfrom  the  representative  microenterprises  and  investment  costs  on  village-level  training,\nconsulting services for community development, domestic technicians, CBSLO formation, rural\ninfrastructure  improvement,  rural  infrastructure  operation  and  maintenance,  and  project\nmanagement.\n1. Financial Analysis\n93. For the financial analysis, 12 microenterprise models were chosen as representative of\npossible livelihood projects that CBSLO members may engage in.  The microenterprises were\nselected mainly for the possible type and range of investment costs that CBSLO members may\nrequire, within the limits of their financial capability and capacity to undertake such projects. The\nrepresentative  microenterprises  included  investments  in:  (i)  agricultural  activities  such  as\nchicken, vegetable, and cocoa production; (ii) food processing such as pineapple candy, palm\nsugar, and kerupuk (crackers) processing; (iii) handicraft making such as the production of\nfurniture, handbags, and palm leaf thatching; and (iv) service enterprises including investments\nin welding shops, stores and restaurants, and transportation services. These representative\nmicroenterprises require minimal capital investments and are easy to implement, given the\nlimited skills, types of resources available, and low level of education of prospective investors.", "31\n94. The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) for each microenterprise was estimated to determine its\nviability. The analysis indicated that each representative microenterprise was financially sound,\nwith calculated BCRs greater than one. A summary of the investment and financial models of\neach  of  these  individual  microenterprises  is  presented  in  Table  3.  Returns  to  labor  are\ncalculated by dividing revenue less all costs except labor by the amount of labor required.\nTable 3: Summary of Microenterprise Investments, Net Income, and BCR\nCapital Production Return to\nMicroenterprise Investment Revenue Cost Net Income BCRa Labor b\n(Rp) (Rp) (Rp) (Rp) (Rp/day)\nA.

As the microenterprises are highly vulnerable to significant changes in output and input\nprices, switching values were calculated to determine how much output prices must decrease\nand production costs must increase to make the BCR equal to one. The analysis indicates that\nagricultural production activities required substantial decreases in output prices (10-25 percent)\nor increases in production costs (14-36 percent) compared with other types of investment\nactivities to maintain a BCR equal to one. Food processing and most service enterprises were\nfound to be sensitive to changes in output prices and production costs. The results of the\nswitching value calculations are in Table A14.1, Appendix 14.\n96. Based on the calculated streams of incremental benefits and investment costs, the\ncalculated FIRR before debt service for the microenterprises is 45 percent, which adequately\ncovers the 33 percent interest rate on capital investment. This calculation is made over a six-\nyear period taken as the life cycle for the small enterprises used as examples.\n2. Economic Analysis\n97. The economic analysis required a comparison of economic viability in with\u2013 and without\u2013\nProject situations based on estimates of (i) project investments, (ii) incremental costs associated\nwith  O&M  of  rural  infrastructure,  and  (iii)  incremental  costs  and  benefits  associated  with\nmicroenterprise  production  activities.  The  economic  evaluation  was  carried  out  for  those\naspects of the Project directly related to the preparation or undertaking of economic activities in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects. All investments in parts B\nand C, 60 percent of total investments in part D, and all investments in part A related to", "32\ncommunity development \u2013 consulting services, village-level training, and facilitators \u2013 were\nincluded in the analysis.\n98. The  resulting  net  present  value  showed  that  part  B  is  expected  to  generate\napproximately Rp102 billion (about $14.6 billion) for the economy. The Project is expected to\nrealize an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of about 17 percent.\n99.  Switching values indicate that the EIRR is not highly sensitive to decreases in prices of\nmicroenterprise products or to increases in project investment costs. For the EIRR to fall to 12\npercent, the level assumed to be the economic opportunity cost of capital, prices need to fall by\n23 percent while investment costs need to increase by about 30 percent. Both price and\ninvestment costs need to decrease and increase, respectively, by about 13 percent to maintain\nan EIRR equal to 12 percent  (Appendix 14).\n100. The Project will benefit both economic and social development by ensuring that the\ntargeted districts, villages, and individuals have the benefit of improved local administrative\ncapability,  support  for  participatory  planning  and  implementation  of  improvements  in  rural\ninfrastructure,  and  access  to  financial  services  and  microenterprise  support.  The  poor  in\nparticular  will  benefit  from  much  improved  economic  opportunities  grounded  in  the\nempowerment of rural village communities.\nB. Environment\n101. Since  the  IEE  assessed  two  categories  of  project  activities  (civil  works  and\nentrepreneurial  activities)  could  have  potential  environmental  impact,  an  environmental\nmanagement and monitoring plan will be prepared. The services of an environmental specialist\nwill be engaged at the start of project implementation to prepare the plan. Private sector\ncontractors, the PIU, and village staff involved in the construction of civil works under part C,\nand CBSLO and BPD officials involved in the processing and approval of subborrower loans for\nentrepreneurial activities under part B will actively participate in managing and monitoring the\nenvironment. This will ensure that any potential environmental impact is minimized and project\nactivities fully conform to the environmental guidelines of the Government and ADB.\nC. Social Dimensions\n102. The Project is designed to link underserved villages commercially to growth centers and\nto institute a process whereby all villagers, including the poor, are able to plan village-level\ndevelopment and form self-help savings and loan organizations. In this regard, the Project has\nseveral important social features. It targets IDT villages: almost all the 72 subdistricts to be\ncovered by the  Project have a preponderance of IDT villages, which is the best available proxy\nat the design stage to locate the Project in poor rural areas in the six provinces. Based on\ninformation  obtained  during  the  feasibility  study  and  a  sample  of  village  socioeconomic\nprofiles,36 it is estimated that over half of the 750 villages to be covered are IDT villages. Most\nhouseholds in these villages are at or below the poverty line, estimated at Rp670,000 (less than\n$100) per annum in year 2000 values. Interviews conducted during the TA feasibility studies\nperiod and during the Loan Fact-Finding and Appraisal Missions confirmed that many, if not the\nmajority, of project participants would be those at or below the poverty line.\n                                                \n36 A sample of about 30 village profiles was obtained during field reconnaissance.", "33\n103. To ensure that more reliable and poverty-sensitive criteria are used and to provide an\nopportunity for the DGRCE field staff and for potential target beneficiaries to participate in the\nselection process, it was decided not to finalize village selection during the project design stage.\nRather, the villages would be selected in year 1 of project implementation, following a rapid rural\nappraisal of each subdistrict and consultation (using focus group interview techniques) with a\nsample of potential beneficiaries.\n104. The Project will make a significant investment in process-oriented activities to involve a\nbroad  spectrum  of  local  government  and  village  participants  in  identifying,  preparing,  and\nimplementing  village  development  plans  and  in  forming  and  operating  the  CBSLOs.  Such\nactivities will account for about 20 percent of the total project cost. The investment is expected\nto  generate  significant  positive,  although  intangible,  social  impacts:  inclusion  of  target\nbeneficiaries alongside local government officials in making key decisions concerning the use of\nfunds for local development at the level where they matter most. This feature will ensure that\nProject-funded  activities  will  be  demand-driven  and  \u201cowned\u201d  by  local  communities,  thus\nunderscoring  the  purpose  of  the  decentralization  laws.  More  specifically,  through  the\ncommunity-based  planning  mechanisms,  Kelompok Kerja Pembangunan Masyarakat  and\nCBSLOs, village participants would develop and apply planning and management skills for local\ndevelopment. It is expected that these villagers, if not themselves poor people, would also be in\na position to advocate and address the interests of the poor and any disadvantaged groups in\nthe village institutional context as well as within the new local government framework. The\nProject would thus empower the targeted rural communities by providing them the capabilities to\nput social meaning into the government decentralization process.\n1. Gender Considerations\n105. Reconnaissance studies and other information gathered during the feasibility studies\nindicate  that  women  and  particularly  relatively  poor  women  form  the  majority  of  micro-\nentrepreneurs and savers in rural communities in the six provinces. Women from several ethnic\ngroups in Sulawesi have established a strong tradition in producing and selling in local markets\nhandicrafts such as mats, stone jewelry (with distinctive designs of their ethnic groups), and\nprocessed foods from their home gardens. This observation is mirrored in the list of proposals\nobtained from feedback interviews with potential target beneficiaries \u2013 the majority involved food\nor product processing and small businesses commonly operated by women. These findings\nprovide  assurance  that  women  will  benefit  directly  from  the  Project\u2019s  investments  in\nmicroenterprise development, provided care is taken that this assumption is borne out during\nproject implementation, and that poor women are not outcompeted by better-off members of the\nCBSLOs in seeking loan support. Training for CBSLOs will emphasize inclusion of women in all\naspects of operations. Lending policies will be tailored to the demand of women entrepreneurs\nand skewed in favor of poor women. The project consultants will work out the details during\nimplementation of the CBSLOs formation subcomponent.\n2. Indigenous People\u2019s Plan\n106. An  indigenous  people\u2019s  plan  was  prepared.  The  Mission  assessed  the  Project  as\nessentially neutral for indigenous people. It will not have a negative effect on their cultural or\npolitical norms or affect their access to land or other resources. The empowerment process\nunder part A will be beneficial to marginal communities that wish to participate and which may\nhave been neglected in the previous centrally planned development process. Local communities\nwill be given greater opportunities and increased skills to plan, manage, and decide on the\ncontent and direction of their own development plans. Part of the subdistrict development plan\nwill be identifying and mapping marginal or isolated communities and groups. In general, the", "34\nProject is expected to bring positive benefits to indigenous people by giving them access to\nmainstream services and to improved governance practices (Appendix 15).\nD.  Impact on Poverty\n1.  Poverty Reduction\n107. The Project targets the poor by helping them secure their livelihood through improved\nmicrofinance services and rural infrastructure, empowering them in village economic and social\nlife through village-level social mobilization, and influencing the political process by increasing\nthe capacity of local officials to respond to the needs of the poor. The Project promotes the\nparticipation of women at every step of this process and brings microfinance services to the\nvillage,  enabling  women  to  save  and  obtain  credit  more  securely,  and  thus  reduce  their\ndependence on moneylenders. The Project will also benefit about 4,500 community leaders\ntrained in participatory approaches, management skills, and financial management.\n108. The Project aims to reduce poverty by increasing the incomes of about 425,000 people,\nor 85,000 families, through microenterprise and small enterprise development. Of these, about\n370,000 people, or 74,000 families, are expected to move above the poverty line. The Project\nwill directly benefit about 550,000 people, or 110,000 families, in the project area, equivalent to\n4 percent of the population, through capacity building for local government, employment, and\nenterprise development. About 1.1 million people, or 220,000 families, in 750 villages in 11\ndistricts will benefit from improved rural infrastructure enabling them access to markets in\nnearby urban centers or growth corridors for their products and to social and health services. An\nestimated 185,000 jobs will be generated from project activities. The Project will extend the\ngeographic scope of its community training and community empowerment, under part A, to an\nadditional 40 districts from 20 expansion provinces following successful midterm evaluation of\nthe Project. The community-based planning mechanism introduced are key to instituting good\ngovernance practices in the community development process.\n2. Nonquantifiable Benefits\n109. The  Project  addresses  social  exclusion  issues  that  when  resolved,  will  bring  non-\nquantifiable benefits to the rural communities and the poor. The community-based planning\nmechanisms to be introduced under part A will involve democratic practices and processes to\nanchor decision making over what and how resources would be used for communal benefit.\nParticipants will be elected by villagers and proposals for the village development plans will be\nconsidered and approved by elected representatives (village-level and community-level), in an\nintervillage forum. These mechanisms are key to instituting good governance practices in the\ncommunity development process. In that respect, the Project will help effect the democratic\nunderpinnings of decentralized government as promulgated by the two decentralization laws.\nThe  trainees  will  include  government  officials  in  the  subdistricts  and  districts  where  these\nprocesses  currently  are  weakest.  The  Project  is  envisaged  to  strengthen  the  village\ncommunities\u2019 ability to articulate and lobby for support for their development plans as well as\ntheir respective district governments\u2019 ability to respond to their demands. As the Project will\ntarget poor villages, this capacity-building process will directly benefit the poor by providing\nthem a means to draw the attention of local government and resources to their development\nneeds.  Furthermore,  the  Project  criteria  that  women  be  adequately  represented  in  the\ninstitutions  and  training  activities  to  be  sponsored  will  mean  that  women  as  well  as  men\nparticipate in and benefit from the process.", "35\n110. Increased  opportunities  for  diploma  and  degree  training  under  the  human  resource\ndevelopment subcomponent will widen the base of trained local government workers. About\n1,634 staff in subdistricts and districts will be trained for a three-year diploma or a four-year\nbachelor\u2019s  degree  under  the  Project.  This  should  improve  their  capability  for  community\ndevelopment work, with subsequent positive impacts on their morale and productivity. For\nanother 139 senior officials who would receive postgraduate training locally and overseas, the\nopportunity to attend universities will widen their experience and provide new insights into how\ndevelopment planning is carried out in Indonesia and in the region. It will also allow them to\nlearn from the experiences of others.\n111. The formation of community members into CBSLOs, together with associated training\nand support, will empower them by ensuring their representation and participation in sustainable\nvillage development and resource management activities. Membership in the CBSLOs will also\n(i) improve access of the participants to financial services for livelihood or supplemental income-\ngenerating activities; (ii) strengthen their income-earning capacities; and (iii) equip them with the\nnecessary skills in small enterprise management and entrepreneurship in a wider variety of\noccupations, thus widening their financial options. The heightened awareness of women of their\nimportant role in the success of project initiatives, the enhancement of their skills for livelihood\ndevelopment  activities  and  credit  and  savings  mobilization,  and  their  empowerment  for\ncommunity leadership and resource management activities are anticipated to be important\nproject achievements. Similarly, for both men and women, improvement in confidence and\nmorale with direct participation in both planning and implementing village plans and the Project\ncan produce lasting change.\n112. The provision of basic social infrastructure facilities (e.g., potable water supply, drainage,\nand community halls) will improve the general health of the community residents as a result of\nbetter  personal  hygiene  and  sanitation.  Most  of  all,  investments  in  rural  roads  will  open\nopportunities for poor people in villages to market their produce at better prices and to access\nproducts and services. Probably no other single form of investment creates the same level of\nnonquantifiable benefits as small rural roads connecting villages to the major transport and\ncommunication systems.\nE.  Risks\n113. If implemented as planned, decentralization of administrative and financial functions is\nexpected to improve project implementation in line with the envisaged improvement in the\nefficiency  of  delivery  of  public  services.  In  addition,  the  Project  will  assist  in  the  general\ndemocratization process through the capacity-building program under part A of the Project,\nwhich is the essential adjunct to decentralization. Increasing participation by ordinary (including\npoor) people in the decision-making process and the corresponding pressure from them for\ntransparency will greatly assist in combating the dangers from malfeasance and corruption.\n114. The prevailing ambiguity about the precise nature of the division of administrative and\nfinancial  responsibilities  between  different  levels  of  government  for  implementing  rural\ndevelopment programs poses two types of risk in project implementation. First, would the\nCentral Government leave the entire counterpart financial responsibility for implementing the\nProject on the participating province or districts? Second, given the ensuing changes in the\nsystem of fiscal transfers from the Central to the regional governments, including the channeling\nof external assistance, would the participating provinces and districts be expected to shoulder\nthe financial burden of servicing and repaying the ADB loans for the Project? The Government\nhas  provided  assurances  that  limit  the  uncertainties  in  the  financial  and  institutional\narrangements for project implementation that may arise from the division of administrative and", "36\nfinancial responsibilities between different levels of government. The Government assured the\nADB Appraisal Mission that such changes are internal to the Government and that the Central\nGovernment  as  the  Borrower  would  remain  responsible  for  the  counterpart  financial\ncommitment to the Project.\n115. As with most projects, the timely availability of counterpart funds will be necessary for\nsuccess as well as the availability of counterpart personnel at national, provincial, and district\nlevels.  The  Government\u2019s  continued  commitment  to  improving  the  capacity  of  regional\ngovernments  and  to  poverty  reduction  should  ensure  that  the  necessary  resources  are\nforthcoming. The Government has agreed that annual budgets will be provided to the Project\nthrough special allocations to ensure timeliness of funds needed for implementation, and an\nexpanded formal education program will widen the base of trained local workers at subdistrict\nand district levels, thus addressing the concerns about availability and quality of counterpart\nstaff.\n116. Within  the  Project  itself,  there  will  always  be  risks  associated  with  investment  in\nmicroenterprises even though their finances appear reasonably robust. Much also will depend\non the organization and capacity of the CBSLOs and especially on the commitment of CBSLO\nmembers. For this reason, the Project has provided for NGO facilitators, most of whom will be\ndrawn from NGOs in the area concerned, including existing credit unions where available, to\nprovide  in-depth  contact  and  discussion  encouraging  prospective  beneficiaries  to  actively\nparticipate in CBSLO formation. The Mission at appraisal had assessed that suitable NGOs and\nNGO facilitators are available in the project area.\n117. The  financial  and  economic  risks  associated  with  microenterprise  development  are\ninevitably present, but the financial and economic analyses indicate a reasonable degree of\nrobustness.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\n118. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents.\nA.  Specific Assurances\n119. The Government will ensure that\n(i)  necessary  annual  amounts  will  be  provided  to  the  Project  through  special\nallocations to the PMO, the PCOs and the PIUs, except for the funds for the\ncredit component, which the Government will relend to the BPDs under separate\nsubsidiary loan agreements; and will continue throughout project implementation\nunless otherwise agreed upon with ADB, notwithstanding any reallocation of\nauthority or responsibility for channeling of external assistance or provision of\ncounterpart funds arising out of the process of decentralization;\n(ii)  regular  updates  on  the  process  of  decentralization  arising  from  the\nimplementation of Laws 22 and 25 are submitted to ADB, and the Government\nwill take into account ADB\u2019s views on such updates;\n(iii)  timely  submission  of  annual  budgetary  appropriation  requests  are  made,\nincluding funding for annual O&M expenditures after project completion; and that\nall other measures necessary for prompt disbursement of loan and counterpart", "37\nfunds to the PMO, participating provinces, and districts are effected during each\nyear of project implementation;\n(iv)  DGRCE will seek ADB approval of its formal and short-term education programs,\nspecifying the areas for training, selection criteria for domestic and international\ndegree and short-term education programs and institutions; duration of training,\nproposed trainees, and the estimated expenditures;\n(v) rural infrastructure constructed under the Project will be operated and maintained\nby villages concerned through provision of necessary counterpart support in cash\nor in kind; and each village organization and the PIU concerned will sign a\nmemorandum of agreement  detailing the obligations of each village for routine\nmaintenance activities;\n(vi)  a minimum of 50 percent women will participate in the community training, a\nminimum  of  50  percent  women  will  participate  in  CBSLO  formation  and\nmicroenterprise training, 50 percent of the NGO facilitators will be female, at least\n3 of the 11 PIU district project managers appointed will be female, and the\nproportion of women to be trained under the formal education program will be at\nleast 30 percent for the diploma program, 25 percent for the undergraduate\ndegree program, and 20 percent for the graduate degree program;\n(vii)  an  ADB-approved  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  will  be\nfinalized prior to approval of any rural infrastructure subproject to be financed\nunder the loans; and the BPDs will apply appropriate environmental guidelines\nand cause CBSLOs to apply such guidelines in screening subborrower loan\nproposals to ensure minimum adverse environmental impacts; and\n(viii)  indigenous communities are encouraged to participate in all project activities by\ndeveloping mechanisms to include them in capacity building, CBSLO formation,\nand  microenterprise  training,  and  the  PPMS  will  be  geared  to  monitor  their\nparticipation.\nB.  Conditions for Disbursement to BPDs\n120.

Brief Description of the Subcomponent\n1. The rural infrastructure component will improve the ability of the general population and\nentrepreneurs  in  selected  subdistricts  and  villages  to  develop,  expand,  and  market  their\nproducts by constructing or improving rural infrastructure.  The rural infrastructure, in most\ncases, will be for the common good. It will link a village to nearby villages and connect all to the\ngrowth centers.  The various infrastructure subprojects will be selected using a participatory\napproach that considers the needs of the villages or the common good of a cluster of villages.\nB.  Types of Infrastructure Subprojects\n2. The Mission considers three types of infrastructure subprojects relevant to the Project:\nType I Type II Type III\nNew roads Rehabilitate access roads Pathways\nBridges/box culverts Village markets Drying floors\nJetties Village offices Storage sheds\nDeep tubewells for Sea walls Pump houses\n    water supply1 Medium-size warehouses Community latrines\nLarge warehouses Village drains\nElectric distribution  Meeting halls\n    lines to national electric Bus shelters\n    company (PLN) Village roads\nFish auction markets Terracing\n  Shallow wells\nCulverts\nWater distribution pipes\n3. The types of rural infrastructure and actual construction procedures are as follows:\n4. Type I. Contracted works using only district licensed construction contractors who will\nsupply the heavy equipment, expertise, and materials required.  However, the contractor will\nengage a large complement of village labor from the villages concerned.  Type I subprojects are\nrelatively complex and will require the services of the district public works offices in association\nwith the project implementation units (PIUs) for investigations, survey, design, and technical\nspecifications. District-level public works officers will assist the PIUs in awarding contracts and\nsupervising the work. Type I civil works are expected to cost about $100,000-$250,000 using\nlocal competitive bidding (LCB) procedures and local labor, except for the 11 core subprojects\nestimated to cost $500,000 or less.\n5. Type II. Contracted works using prequalified licensed construction contractors who will\nsupply  the  heavy  equipment  and  expertise.  However,  only  village  labor  for  the  villages\nconcerned will be employed.  Materials will be purchased by the PIU and supplied directly to the\nvillages concerned.  Type II subprojects are moderately complex and will require the services of\nthe district public works offices for design and technical specifications, and to assist the PIUs in\nawarding contracts and supervising the work. They cost about $50,000-$100,000 using LCB\nprocedures and local labor.\n                                                \n1 These deepwells will provide drinking water to several villages. Deep tubewells for irrigation or other enterprises will\nbe conducted through the credit program with Bank Pembangunan Daerah (regional development bank).", "44045\nAppendix 3, page 2\n6. Type III. These are simple, selp-help projects and will use only village labor under the\ncontrol of a construction supervisor. The PIUs will directly supply materials to the villages\nconcerned.  Laborers and supervisors will be paid for their labor at a lower labor scale, i.e., 70\npercent of the average subdistrict labor rate.  Thus, villagers will have a minimum 30 percent\nstakeholders equity in the civil works.  The works will be contracted, through a memorandum of\nagreement between the PIUs and the village, most probably as a lump sum contract or possibly\na daily rate contract. The village laborers will be paid by the village organization with funds\nprovided by the PIU and monitored by PIU staff.  Type III civil works are expected to cost less\nthan $50,000.\n7. In all three types of subprojects, the affected villagers will be the primary source of labor.\nC.  Selection Criteria for Rural Infrastructure Subprojects\n8. Appropriate rural infrastructure subprojects at the village level will be selected on the\nfollowing criteria:\n(i)  The subproject is located in a project subdistrict.\n(ii)  A new community planning organization has been established and is functioning\nin the participating village.\n(iii)  The subproject is for the common good of the participating villages.\n(iv)  The subproject is on the priority list of work to improve the quality of life and\ncommerce in the participating villages and is connected to the development of\nnearby villages with commercial links to urban growth centers.\n(v)  For type I and type II subprojects, the PIU and affected villages will enter into a\nmemorandum of agreement defining the responsibilities of all parties, including\npublic works offices and others.\n(vi)  For  type  III  subprojects,  the  PIU  and  the  villagers  will  enter  into  a  similar\nmemorandum of agreement.\n(vii)  The infrastructure will serve more than one village and link, in some way, rural\nurban commercial centers.\n(viii)  Investigations,  surveys,  designs,  drawings,  technical  specifications,  and  cost\nestimates can be prepared in about three months and approved by the PIU and\nvillage organizations concerned.\n(ix)  Concerned  government  agencies,  district  planning  agency  and  district  public\nworks office, have been consulted and have agreed to the intervention.\n(x)  Prior to starting construction, rural infrastructure engineers are engaged at the\ndistrict  level  and  nongovernment  organization  construction  specialists  are\nengaged to supervise the works.\n(xi)  Type I subprojects should range in cost between $100,000 and $250,000; type II\nsubprojects,  about  $50,000-$100,000;  and  type  III  subprojects,  less  than\n$50,000.\n(xii)  The concerned village organization enters into an operations and maintenance\nmemorandum of agreement with the PIU.  Materials will be provided by the PIU\nand the villages will provide labor, free of charge on a self-help basis.\n(xiii)  Subprojects with potentially adverse environmental impacts, as determined by\nan initial environmental examination, and which cannot be easily mitigated will be\nexcluded from the Project.", "44046\nAppendix 3, page 3\nD.  Selection of 11 Core Subprojects in 11 Districts\n9. Eleven districts in the six provinces will select 11 core subprojects to start implementing\nthe Project in the first two years.  The subprojects will aim to assist commercial activities, as well\nas improve the lives of the people in the villages concerned, and should be aimed for the\ncommon good. The core subprojects are expected to include rehabilitation of road links and\nconstruction of bridges/box culverts on those road links so as to move commerce and improve\ntransportation  links  for  general  purposes.  The  roads  will  serve  several  villages  and  be\nconnected to the commercial areas of growth centers.  The maximum length of road will be\nabout 2-3 kilometers and will include 2-3 drainage crossings (bridges or box culverts). Each\nsubproject is expected to cost $500,000 or less.", "Appendix 4, page 1\n44047\nCOST ESTIMATES\nTable A4.1:  Project Cost Summary, by Component\n($'000)\n% % Total\n      Component Foreign Local Foreign Base\nExchange Currency Total Exchange Costs\nA.

Introduction\n1. To  support  the  development  of  community-based  savings  and  loan  organizations\n(CBSLOs) in the project area, six regional development banks (Bank Pembangunan Daerah or\nBPD) will serve as Executing Banks. CBSLOs will be formed in each participating village to\nmobilize savings, provide financial services among the members, and manage small loans for\nenterprise development. The six BPDs are BPD Central Kalimantan, BPD East Kalimantan,\nBPD South Kalimantan, BPD Central Sulawesi, BPD North Sulawesi, and BPD Southeast\nSulawesi.\n2. The BPDs are owned by the provincial and local governments. They were established in\n1961-1965  to  promote  regional  development,  increase  regional  income  sources,  and  help\ndevelop rural financial institutions. In 1967, an act allowed the BPDs to accept demand deposit,\ngrant short-term loans, and participate in equity investments, thereby expanding their powers\nand enabling them to compete with regular commercial banks. The BPDs have headquarters in\nthe  provincial  capital,  and  branches  in  the  districts.  Not  all  BPDs  have  branches  in  the\nsubdistrict. BPD South Kalimantan has a strong background in microfinance gained from the\nADB\u2019s Microfinance Project; the five other BPDs have been involved in Government-funded\nmicrofinance schemes.\nB.  Performance of the Six BPDs\n1.  Financial Indicators\n3. The assets of the six BPDs increased by 15.8 percent annually during the last five years.\nTheir combined total assets amounted to Rp1,582.4 billion ($226 million equivalent) at the end\nof 1999. The growth in assets is attributed to the BPDs\u2019 profitable operation as well as to\nadditional capital infusion to one BPD from the owners.\n4. In terms of profitability, all six BPD performed well during the past five years, except for\nBPD North Sulawesi, which barely made a profit and did not meet the acceptable return on\nequity (ROE) for three years. As a result, BPD North Sulawesi was recapitalized and underwent\nmajor structural changes in 1999. Its profitability slightly improved by the end of 1999 when it\nposted a 9 percent ROE. The total assets, total equity, and net income after tax of the six BPDs\nfrom 1995 to 1999 are in Table A6.1.\n5. Combined  with  the  growth  in  assets,  the  six  BPDs  have  increased  their  interbank\nplacements and reduced their loans receivable. On the average, the six BPDs loan portfolio is\nonly 34 percent of their total productive assets. A substantial portion of their productive assets is\nin interbank placements rather than in loans receivable. Interbank placements are temporary\ninvestments and are also a liquidity buffer. Because of the financial crisis in 1997, it was\nrelatively safer to put money in other banks than to extend loans. However, the demand for\nloans  is  expected  to  increase  and  so  the  loan  portfolio  is  also  expected  to  grow,  as  the\nIndonesian  economy  recovers  from  the  shock  of  1997  and  interest  rates  continue  on  a\ndowntrend. Table A6.2 shows the distribution of the productive assets of the six BPDs by the\nend of 1999.\n6. In terms of growth, the combined loan portfolio of the six BPDs increased in 1996 and\n1997, but contracted by 3.9 percent in 1998, compared with the 1995 level. Only BPD South\nKalimantan and BPD Southeast Sulawesi were able to significantly increase their loan portfolio.\nAll six BPDs were affected by the financial crisis and experienced collection problems. During\nthe crisis, lending activities slowed down but lending showed signs of picking up in 1999.

Quality of Assets\n8. Bank Indonesia monitors monthly the BPDs productive assets ratio (PAR) and the extent\nof the nonperforming loans. The Bank requires all BPDs to make proper provisions for possible\nlosses  from  their  productive  assets  so  that  their  financial  statements  will  reflect  their  true\nfinancial condition.\n9. The Mission\u2019s analysis of the quality of assets of the BPDs indicates a rating ranging\nfrom satisfactory to excellent, except for BPD Central Sulawesi which scored poorly because of\nits large nonperforming loan portfolio \u2014 equivalent to more than half of its Rp15 billion loan\naccounts by the end of 1999. BPD Central Sulawesi informed the Mission that it has not written\noff these accounts because of the ongoing efforts to collect on them or to foreclose them.\nHowever, in computing the PAR, these past due loans are treated as lost for conservatism. The\nrating of the BPDs in terms of productive assets ratio is shown in Table A6.5.\nTable A6.5: Productive Assets Ratioa\n(percent)\n    BPDb     1999     1998     1997        1996        1995\nCentral Kalimantan 3.8 8.1 10.1 7.5 4.4\nSouth Kalimantan 2.1 2.3 1.9 1.6 2.1\nEast Kalimantan 6.3 12.4 6.7 6.4 4.9\nNorth Sulawesi 2.6 14.9 21.2 19.4 4.7\nCentral Sulawesi 18.9 19.0 14.8 11.2 8.4\nSoutheast Sulawesi 3.2 4.6 4.0 2.7 2.8\na Good:   0 \u2013 4.0%,  satisfactory:   4.1% \u2013 6.0%,  less than satisfactory:   6.1% \u2013 8.0%,  poor:   8.1% up.\nb  \nRegional development bank.", "44055\nAppendix 6, page 4\nC.  Mission\u2019s Assessment of the Financial Conditions of Six BPDs\n1.  CAMEL Rating\n10. The Mission used the CAMEL instrument in assessing the financial conditions of the six\nBPDs because it reconciles the short-term and long-term measures of performance. CAMEL is\nthe acronym for capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings history, and liquidity\nmanagement.  CAMEL  was  created  in  1979  to  enable  North  American  bank  regulators  to\nmeasure the financial and management soundness of US commercial lending institutions, using\nkey ratios, indicators, and institutional policies and procedures.\n11. The average CAMEL scores of the six BPDs for 1995-1999 indicate that they were either\nin good or satisfactory financial condition, except for BPD Central Sulawesi, which obtained a\n\u201cless than satisfactory\u201d rating (Tables A6.6 and A6.7). The main reason for this rating was its\nhigh ratio of nonperforming loans (para. 21). In 1999, BPD North Sulawesi was recapitalized\nand underwent structural changes. As a result, it obtained a \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating at the end of\n1999.\nTable A6.6: Five-Year Average CAMEL Rating of Six Regional Development Banks\n(1995-1999)\n    Central South East North Central Southeast\n   Criterion Kalimantan Kalimantan Kalimantan Sulawesi Sulawesi Sulawesi\n Capital Adequacy 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.4 4.0 4.0\n Asset Quality 2.1 3.7 1.9 1.8 1.0 3.4\n Management a 2.1 3.1 2.8 2.7 2.2 3.1\n Earnings 3.8 4.0 4.0 2.8 3.9 4.0\n Liquidity 3.3 3.0 3.3 3.7 3.0 3.4\n Overall Rating Based on\n  Weighted Criteria b 2.9 3.6 3.0 2.7 2.5 3.6\na The ratings for six BPDs are based on Mission\u2019s estimates of BPD management for 1999.\nb Good: 3.2-4.0, Satisfactory: 2.6 - less than 3.2, Less than satisfactory: 2.2 -  less than 2.6, Poor: 0- less than\n  2.2.\nSource: Mission estimates based on BPD data.\n12.

Improving BPD Central Sulawesi Operations\n14. The Mission assessed the effect of the nonperforming loans on the future operations of\nBPD Central Sulawesi. The results indicate that BPD Central Sulawesi will continue to be a\nviable bank. With more persistent, regular, and determined effort to collect loan accounts, its\nfinancial position can be significantly improved.\n4. Effect of Proposed Relending by MOF to Six BPDs\n15. The respective capital1 of all the six BPDs will remain adequate even after disbursement\nof the entire $2.5 million MOF credit loan to each BPD. Among the six BPDs, BPD Central\nSulawesi has the smallest capital at Rp9.8 billion ($1.4 million). Its capital adequacy ratio, which\nstood at 38 percent at the end of 1999, would have increased to 41 percent by year 2001\nwithout the MOF credit loan. With the $2.5 million loan, its capital adequacy ratio can still be\nmaintained within the 34-38 percent level, which is considered more than sufficient. Its loan-to-\ndeposit ratio will increase from 43 percent to 104 percent, which is within acceptable standards,\nafter it has onlent the funds to the project CBSLOs.\nD. Bank Indonesia\u2019s Assessment of the Six BPDs\n16. Bank  Indonesia  assessment  of  the  six  BPDs  in  March  2000  indicates  that  all  are\nfinancially sound. However, BPD Central Sulawesi received a rating of \u201cless than satisfactory\u201d\nmainly because of its high ratio of nonperforming loans. This BPD continues to operate normally\nand accept deposits from the public.\n17. The  Mission  was  informed  that,  considering  the  above  rating,  Bank  Indonesia  had\nconducted a \u201cfit and proper test\u201d of senior officers and operational procedures of BPD Central\nSulawesi. The result of the test gave BPD Central Sulawesi a passing mark. Bank Indonesia\nand BPD Central Sulawesi have agreed on measures to reduce the amount of nonperforming\nloans in one year to improve the BPD\u2019s Bank Indonesia classification.\nE.  Financial Projections for BPDs\n18. The Mission examined the future financial viability of the six BPDs based on CAMEL\nrating for 2001\u20132006. The assumptions used common to all the BPDs are summarized in Table\nA6.8. The BPDs were assumed to maintain a cash balance equivalent to 1 month operating\nexpenses plus 5 percent of demand liabilities. Excess funds were assumed to be placed in other\nbanks as call loans or plain deposits.\n19. Based on historical data for each BPD as well as in the aggregate, the Mission projected\nthe growth rates of the loan portfolio as well as the demand liabilities of the BPDs. BPD Central\nSulawesi was able to increase its loan portfolio by 36.3 percent in 1996, but posted negative\ngrowth rates in 1997 and 1998 due to the Asian financial crisis. It posted a 3 percent growth rate\nin 1999. Assuming economic recovery in Central Sulawesi Province, the BPD may be capable\nof  duplicating  the  36  percent  growth  rate  of  its  loan  portfolio  in  1996.  However,  using\nconservative projections, the Mission assumed a gradual increase of 10 percent in 2000, 15\npercent in 2001, 20 percent in 2002, and increases of 2 percent thereafter.\n                                                \n1 Including retained earnings.", "Appendix 6, page 6\n44057\nTable A6.8: Assumptions Common to All BPDs\nRate in\nItem Percent\nInterest Income\n     Lending Interest Rate 22\n     Average Interest Rate on Net Interbank Balances   8\n     Administrative Charges on Loan Processing and other Recurring\n         Income Expressed as a Percent of Interest Income   2\nInterest Expense\n     Demand Deposits   0\n     Savings Deposits   5\n     Time Deposits   8\n     CERD Loana 14\nDeposit with Bank Indonesia as a Percent of Deposit Liabilities   5\na CERD = Community Empowerment for Rural Development.\n20. For deposit liabilities, the Mission assumed that the annual growth in demand deposits of\nBPD Central Sulawesi will be 9.6 percent that for savings deposit will be 17.2 percent, and that\nfor time deposit, 19.1 percent. For the five other BPDs, the assumptions used to project the\ngrowth of its loan portfolio and demand deposits are in Table A6.9.\nTable A6.9: Growth Rates of Loan Portfolio and Demand Liabilities\n(2000-2006)\nAnnual Increase (percent)\n   BPDa        Loan Portfolio Demand Savings\nDeposit Deposit Time Deposit\nCentral Kalimantan 2000-2003 \u2013 20% then decreasing 10 20 20\nby 2% annually\nSouth Kalimantan 2000-2006 \u2013 20% 20 20 20\nEast Kalimantan 2000-2006 \u2013 20% 10 20 20\nNorth Sulawesi 10, 15, 20, +2% p.a. thereafter 10 17 10\nCentral Sulawesi 10, 15, 20, +2% p.a. thereafter 9.6 17.2 19.1\nSoutheast Sulawesi 2000-2006 \u2013 20% 20 15 20\na  Regional development bank.\n21. The results indicate that all six BPDs are viable in the long term. BPD Central Sulawesi,\nwhich received a \u201cless than satisfactory\u201d rating in 1999, is projected to obtain a \u201csatisfactory\u201d\nrating in 2001 and 2002, the latter coinciding with the expected disbursement from the project\ncredit line in 2002.\nF.  Conclusions and Recommendations\n22. The Mission concludes that five of the six BPDs are in reasonable financial condition and\nhave good management in place. In the case of BPD Central Sulawesi, management appears\nto be \u201csatisfactory,\u201d but an improvement in performance (reflected in the CAMEL rating) will\nneed to take place. The Mission considers all the six BPDs qualified to participate in the Project\nas Executing Banks but BPD Central Sulawesi must improve its Bank Indonesia rating to\n\u201csatisfactory\u201d before it can borrow credit funds from the Project. This condition is included in the\nLoan Agreement. During project implementation, loan releases from the Project to the six BPDs\nwill also depend on their maintaining a satisfactory rating from Bank Indonesia. Analysis of the\nviability of six BPDs based on financial projections indicates that they are all viable in the long\nterm. BPD Central Sulawesi is projected to obtain a \u201csatisfactory\u201d rating in 2002 when the\ndrawdown from the Project is targeted.", " 58 Appendix 7\nPROPOSED RELENDING AND ONLENDING RATES\nMinistry of MOF takes the FX risks\nADB Finance\n(MOF)\nLoan in rupiah under a\nCurrently 6.53% p.a. subsidiary loan agree-\nment (SLA)\nInterest rate: SBI\n(currently about 12%)\nRegional\nDevelopment\nBanks \nInterest rate: SBI + 8% maximum\n(currently about 20%)\nCBSLO will set its own\nCBSLOs onlending rates to\nmembers.\nApproximately 30% - 33% p.a.\nThis is the current market\nrate used by existing credit\nunions in the project area.\nCBSLO\nMembers\nCBSLO = community-based savings and loan organization, FX = foreign exchange, SBI = Sertifikat Bank Indonesia (Bank\nIndonesia Certificate).", "44059 Appendix 8\nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE\n     Activity/Component Year 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nQuarter 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4\nI.

Objective and Scope\n1. The technical assistance (TA) will assist the Executing Agency (EA), the Directorate\nGeneral of Rural Community Empowerment (DGRCE) of the Ministry of Home Affairs and\nRegional Autonomy, in developing a system for disbursement, monitoring, and accounting of\nproject funds in 11 districts in six provinces to ensure accountability and transparency. The TA\nwill  help  the  participating  district  governments  to  put  in  place  an  appropriate  financial\nmanagement  system  when  they  implement  the  Community  Empowerment  for  Rural\nDevelopment Project (CERDP). The CERDP aims to increase the real incomes of the poor,\nparticularly  the  rural  communities  in  the  peripheral  areas  of  regional  growth  centers.  The\nobjectives of the Project are to (i) empower rural communities by strengthening their capacity to\nplan and manage their own development, and (ii) support investments and foster rural urban\nlinkages by constructing rural infrastructure to promote agricultural productivity and off-farm\nbusiness enterprises.\n2. Last  year,  as  part  of  the  Government  of  Indonesia\u2019s  ongoing  effort  to  strengthen\ngrassroots democracy and decentralize the government system, two laws (Laws 22 and 25)\nwere passed to give autonomy to local governments. The implementation of the two laws will\nrequire structures and administrative procedures to be put in place at the district and village\nlevels to ensure proper transfer and use of development and other financial resources. While\nthe new Ministry of Regional Autonomy (MORA) has started the process of formulating new\nrules and regulations for transfer of fiscal responsibilities to the local government, the Ministry of\nHome  Affairs  (MOHA)  is  tasked  with  applying  and  simplifying  administrative  rules  and\nregulations  for  local  government.  Implementation  of  the  Project  requires  that  the  new\nadministrative structures be in place before project funds are disbursed, but MOHA will not be\nable to fulfill its responsibility as the Executing Agency as it lacks institutional capacity. The\nproposed TA will assist MOHA and the local governments in six provinces targeted by the\nProject to develop, pilot, and train relevant staff to set up the required financial monitoring and\nrelated administrative procedures.\n3. The  objectives  of  the  TA  are  to  (i)  develop,  test,  and  set  up  the  structure  and\nadministrative procedures for disbursing, monitoring, and accounting for funds for implementing\nthe CERDP; and (ii) train district and village officials on the new financial management system\nfor transparent accounting of project funds. The TA covers (i) developing appropriate structures\nand administrative procedures for disbursing, monitoring, and accounting for funds under the\nProject;  (ii)  developing  simple  training  manuals  and  modules  for  use  by  nongovernment\norganization  facilitators  in  training  local  government  officials;  (iii)  developing  and  testing  a\ncomputerized management information system (MIS) combined with monitoring the progress of\nproject  implementation  in  the  day-to-day  management  of  project  activities  and  financial\nmonitoring system for use by CERDP; (iv) conducting training workshops for district and village\nofficials participating in the CERDP in 11 districts in six provinces for one year to disseminate\nthe new financial management system, emphasizing the features that ensure transparency and\naccountability; and (v) preparing a TA completion report.\nB.  Cost Estimates\n4. The TA is estimated to cost $1.4 million equivalent, of which $0.5 million will be the\nforeign exchange cost and $0.9 million equivalent the local currency cost. Of this cost, $1.1\nmillion comprising the foreign exchange costs and $0.6 million equivalent of the local currency\ncosts will be financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), on a grant basis from the Asian\nCurrency Crisis Support Facility, funded by the Government of Japan. The grant financing of", "44070\nAppendix 13, page 2\n$1.1 million constitutes 80 percent of the total TA cost. The Government will finance $0.3 million\nor 20 percent of the total TA cost, mostly in kind (Table A13).\nC.  Implementation Arrangements\n5. The Executing Agency of the TA will be DGRCE. The steering committee for the CERDP\nwill also oversee the implementation of the TA and review the TA reports. DGRCE will provide\ncounterpart staff in areas complementary to those of the consultant team.\n6. ADB will engage the services of a team of consultants and domestic NGO facilitators in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The TA will provide a total of 51\nperson-months  of  international  (23)  and  domestic  (28)  consulting  services,  inclusive  of  12\nmonths  of  NGO  consortium  services.  The  international  consultants  include  financial\nanalyst/accounting specialist (team leader), management information system (MIS) specialist,\nand training specialist.

Introduction\n1. The  financial  analysis  focused  on  the  financial  viability  of  the  possible  representative\nlivelihood  enterprises  in  the  project  area  to  determine  the  financial  viability  of  representative\nmicroenterprises under the Project. As it is difficult to quantify the benefits from the capacity\nbuilding component under part A of the Project, the economic analysis was carried out for part B\ntaken as a whole. The analysis was based on the economic benefits derived from representative\nmicroenterprises and investment costs on village-level training, consulting services for community\ndevelopment, domestic technicians, community-based savings and loan organization (CBSLO)\nformation, rural infrastructure improvement, rural infrastructure operation and maintenance, and\nproject  management.  Costs  in  the  economic  analysis  included  physical  contingencies,  but\nexcluded  price  contingencies,  taxes,  duties,  and  subsidies.  Economic  costs  and  benefits  are\nexpressed in the domestic price numeraire.\nB.  Financial Analysis\n1. Representative Microenterprises\n2. Twelve microenterprise models were identified and chosen as representative of possible\nlivelihood projects that CBSLO members may engage in. The representative microenterprises\nincluded: (i) agricultural activities (chicken, vegetable, and cocoa production); (ii) food processing\n(pineapple candy, palm sugar, and kerupuk [crackers]); (iii) handicraft making (furniture, handbag,\nand palm leaf thatching); and (iv) service enterprises (welding shops, stores and restaurants, and\ntransportation services) (Table A14.1). These microenterprises require minimal capital investments\nand are easy to implement, given the limited skills, types of resources available, and low level of\neducation  of  prospective  investors.  The  financial  analysis  covered  six  years,  comprising  an\nestablishment period of one year and an operation period of five years. The financial assessment\nconsisted of the following calculations: (i) investment cost, (ii) working capital requirement, (iii)\nannual operating cost, (iv) profit and loss forecast, and (v) cash flow for financial planning.  The\nbenefit-cost ratio (BCR) for each microenterprise was estimated to determine their viability.\n3. The analysis indicated that each of the representative microenterprises was financially\nsound and had a calculated BCR greater than one. A summary of the investment and financial\nmodels for the microenterprises is in para. 95 of the RRP. Return to labor is calculated by dividing\nrevenue less all costs except labor by the amount of labor required.\n2. Switching Values\n4. As the microenterprises are highly vulnerable to significant changes in output and input\nprices, switching values were calculated to determine how much output prices must decrease and\nproduction  costs  must  increase  to  make  the  BCR  equal  to  1.  The  analysis  indicates  that\nagricultural production activities require substantial decreases in output prices (12-25 percent), or\nincreases in production costs (14-36 percent), compared with other types of investment activities to\nmaintain a BCR equal to 1. Food processing and most service enterprises were found to be more\nsensitive to changes in output prices and production costs. The results of the switching values\ncalculations are in Table A14.1.\n3. Financial Analysis of  Microenterprises\n5. To determine the net benefits attributed to the microenterprises, an analysis of the with- and\nwithout-project situations was undertaken to provide the basis for estimating the financial internal\nrate of return (FIRR) of the microenterprises as a whole. Under the with-project situation, a total of", "44072\nAppendix 14, page 2\n750 community-based savings and loan organizations (CBSLOs) is assumed to be established in\nareas  covered  under  the  Project  over  the  six-year  period  of  analysis.  Correspondingly,  each\nCBSLO was assumed to have at least 50 microenterprise borrowers. It was further assumed that\nmembers will borrow every other year, after having fully repaid their current loan obligations.\nTable A14.1: Switching Values Necessary to Generate B-C Ratio = 1.0\nDecrease in Output\nMicroenterprise Decrease in Increase in Price and Increase\nOutput Price (%) Costs (%) in Costs (%)\nI.

Assessment of the net benefits under the without-project situation was based on the same\nmicroenterprises assumed under the with-project situation. However, the number of borrowers was\nsubstantially reduced to reflect the significantly lesser number of investors qualified to borrow from\nboth formal and informal credit sources due to lack of creditworthiness. Discussions by the TA\nconsultants with staff of regional development banks indicated that under without project situation,\nthe following proportion of borrowers, relative to the total borrowers under with-project situation,\nmay be assured for each type of investment: (i) agricultural activities, about 20 percent of total\nborrowers assumed under the with-project situation; (ii) food and beverage processing, about 10\npercent; (iii) handicraft making, 10 percent; and (iv) services, five percent. Based on the calculated\nstreams  of  incremental  benefits  and  investment  costs,  the  FIRR  before  debt  service  for  the\nmicroenterprises is estimated at 45 percent, which adequately covers the 33 percent interest rate\non capital investment. This calculation is made over a six-year period taken as the life cycle for the\nsmall enterprises used as examples.\nC. Economic Analysis\n7.  The economic analysis also required a comparison of the Project's economic viability with\nand without the Project, based on estimates of (i) project investments, (ii) incremental costs\nassociated with the operation and maintenance (O&M) of rural infrastructure, and (iii) incremental\ncosts and benefits associated with microenterprise production activities. The economic evaluation\nwas carried out in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects. All\ninvestments in parts B and C, together with 60 percent of total investments in part D, and all\ninvestments in part A related to community development, such as consulting services, village-level\ntraining, and facilitators, were included in the analysis. Investment and O&M costs were converted\nto economic values by a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.95. All costs were expressed in\n2000 constant prices. The economic life of the Project was assumed at 15 years. The project area\nexhibits significant unemployment and underemployment. Most of the unemployed workforce is\nrelatively unskilled. The opportunity cost of unskilled labor was assumed to be lower than the wage\nrate, with a shadow wage rate of 0.75.", "44073\nAppendix 14, page 3\n8. As all microenterprise outputs and production inputs were assumed to be nontradeable,\ntheir  corresponding market  prices,  adjusted  by  an  SCF  of  0.95,  were  used  in  the  economic\nvaluation. The incremental benefit streams derived from the financial analysis of the representative\nmicroenterprises, served as the basis for estimating the incremental economic benefits generated\nby part B of the Project. All benefits were likewise expressed in 2000 constant terms and were\nprojected over a 15-year period. The resulting net present value showed that part B is expected to\ngenerate approximately Rp250 billion for the economy. The Project is expected to realize an\neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of about 17 percent. The economic cost-benefit flows,\nEIRR, and net present values are shown in Table A14.2.\nTable A14.2: Calculation of EIRR for Part Ba\nCapital\nInvestments Rural Incremental\nDevelop- Rural Project Total Infra- Benefits\nment Infrastructure Management c Investments structure from Net\nYear Of O&M a Microenterprises Benefits\nCBSLOs b\n(Rp million) (Rp million) (Rp million) (Rp million) (Rp million) (Rp million) (Rp million)\n2001 26,040 13,536 31,888 71,464       0         0 (71,464)\n2002 62,872 31,028 7,073 100,974       0 (18,155) (119,128)\n2003 60,674 84,832 9,085 154,591    338 (36,776) (191,705)\n2004 161,255 89,627 37,002 287,884 1,114 (28,103) (317,101)\n2005 168,554 48,584 43,457 260,595 3,235    2,153 (261,676)\n2006 137,671 33,516 23,720 194,907 5,476  55,359 (145,023)\n2007                  0                        0                          0                   0 6,690 261,614 254,923\n2008                  0                        0                          0                   0 7,528 379,370 371,842\n2009                  0                        0                          0                   0 7,528 385,790 378,262\n2010 7,528 393,898 386,370\n2011 7,528 389,635 382,107\n2012 7,528 377,519 369,991\n2013 7,528 392,804 385,276\n2014 7,528 393,898 386,370\n2015 7,528 389,635 382,107\nEIRR= 17.11%\nNPV@12%= 249,573\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present values, O&M = operation and maintenance.\na Based on an economic life of 15 years.\nb Including investments in consulting services, village-level training, and facilitators.\nc Assumed that 60 percent of total project management cost accrues to part B of the Project.\nd At 2.5 percent of rural infrastructure investment cost.\nD. Sensitivity Analysis\n9. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to determine the effect of variations in the estimated\ncosts and benefits of the Project. Switching values, indicate that the overall project EIRR is not\nhighly sensitive to decreases in the prices of microenterprise products or to increases in project\ninvestment costs. For the EIRR to fall to 12 percent, the level assumed to be the economic\nopportunity cost of capital, prices need to fall by 26 percent while investment costs need to\nincrease by about 35 percent. Both price and investment costs need to decrease and increase,\nrespectively, by about 15 percent to maintain an EIRR equal to 12 percent.", "44074\nAppendix 15, page 1\nINDIGENOUS PEOPLE PLAN\n1. For the purposes of the Project's Indigenous People Plan, indigenous people are those who\nmeet the Government definition of \"isolated communities.\" Under Ministerial Decree 5/1994, isolated\ncommunities are described as groups of people who live or wander in dispersed, isolated areas and\nfollow a sociocultural system which is \"isolated\" and \"left behind\" in comparison with the rest of\nIndonesian society. \"Isolated\" is understood in terms of both geography and culture, while \"left\nbehind\" is understood in terms of such measures as health, education, housing, clothing, and\nlivelihood. Some characteristics of isolated communities, according to the National Development\nPlanning Agency (BAPPENAS) are as follows:  (i) a nomadic or seminomadic lifestyle, or living in\nsmall, dispersed bands; (ii) livelihood system strongly dependent on the natural environment, such\nas hunting, gathering, fishing, or swidden agriculture; (iii) inadequate standards of personal hygiene\nor cleanliness of environment; (iv) meager or no clothing; (v) low standard of housing;  (vi) very\nlimited knowledge and low use of technology; (vii) belief system that is animistic; and (viii) strong\nattachment to their cultural and belief systems, which makes them culturally closed.\n2. These communities or groups also have in common many of the following traits relevant to\nthe concept of indigenous people:  \"Priority in time with respect to the occupation and use of a\nspecific  territory.  The  voluntary  perpetuation  of  cultural  distinctiveness,  which  may  include  the\naspects of language, social organization, religion and spiritual values, modes of production, laws and\ninstitutions. Self Identification as well as recognition by other groups, or by the State authorities, as a\ndistinct collective group; and an experience of subjugation, dispossession, marginalization, exclusion\nor discrimination, whether or not these conditions persist.\"\n3.  The Ministry of Social Affairs is responsible for the development of communities that have\nbeen  classified  as  \u201cisolated  communities,\u201d  through  the  Directorate  General  of  Social  Welfare\nDevelopment under the Directorate for Isolated Communities. Implementation of isolated community\ndevelopment programs under the directorate includes settlement in place of origin, resettlement, and\ncoordination and cooperation of technical agencies to facilitate their accessing and mainstreaming\ninto general development activities.  While indigenous people cannot be identified on the basis of an\nofficial list of \"Isolated Communities,\" nor enumerated by reference to official census records, agency\nrecords can be used to identify districts where indigenous people are likely to be located.  The\nMission identified seven districts among the nine proposed project districts where the ministry has or\nhad isolated community development in the past, and which are therefore considered to potentially\ncontain a concentration of indigenous people. This list will be used to facilitate identification and,\ntherefore, participation and access of indigenous people to benefits from the Project (Table A15).\nTable A15: Indigenous People in the Project Area\nProject District Indigenous People Indigenous Ethnic Groups\nKapuas X Dayak Ngaiu Danum, Dayak Naiu\nBarito Utara X Dayak Dusun Malang, Dayak Taboyan, Dayak\nUt Danum\nTanah Laut X Dayak Bukit\nBanjar X Dayak Bukit, Dayak Kaharupan\nBolaan Mengondow\nMinahasa\nPoso X Rampi, Wana, Rana\nDongala X Tolare, Tajio, Pendala, Sajuan, Lanje, Kori\nKendari X Bajo and Tolaki\nX = refers to presence of indigenous people", "44075\nAppendix 15, page 2\n4.   There is a large number of major and minor groups in the project area, that have been\nrecognized by the Ministry of Social Affairs as meeting this requirement, and who have been defined\nby themselves or by outside authorities as indigenous people. These groups have traditionally been\nunable to participate fully in development activities because of problems associated with isolation\nand, sometimes, cultural stereotyping and negative bias on the part of the authorities. The direct\ngrant component of the Government IDT program for poverty reduction from 1993 to 1997 provided\nonly  one  of  three  rounds  of  grants  to  villages  with  less  than  100  households.  The  village\ninfrastructure programs being assisted by Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and the\nWorld  Bank  exclude  villages  of  50  households  or  less,  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  Kecamatan\nDevelopment Program (KDP) similarly excludes small villages and subdistricts. This serves to limit\nthe access of indigenous people to mainstream development activities.  To avoid the problem of\nexclusion of small villages and indigenous people under the Project, no minimum village size will be\nset. All established villages will be considered as eligible to participate in the Project.\n5.  During implementation, the project implementation unit (PIU) at the district level will be\nresponsible  for  identifying  subdistricts  containing  indigenous  people  within  its  jurisdiction,  in\nconsultation  with  institutions  and  organizations  responsible  or  directly  associated  with  isolated\ncommunities \u2013 Departments of Social Affairs, Education, Forestry, BAPPEDA, at district levels, and\nmissionary groups and those working in environmental conservation projects. While selection of\nvillages remains with the district PIUs, participating districts will be encouraged to include those with\nconcentrations of indigenous people.  Selection and participation of indigenous communities will be\nmonitored.\n6.  The Project is expected to bring positive benefits to indigenous people through access to\nmainstream services and improved governance. All participation is voluntary, communities are not\nrequired to participate if they do not choose to. The indigenous communities must approve all works,\nand  activities  that  require  resettlement  will  not  be  funded.  The  development  of  capability  for\nparticipatory planning and implementation at both the district and village levels, and implementation\nof participatory monitoring will help ensure that local development planning reflects local interest.  In\naddition to preventing the exclusion of indigenous people on the basis of settlement size, the Project\nwill enable their participation, through the requirement that nongovernment organization facilitators to\nbe engaged under the Project speak the dominant language of the district and priority be given to\ncandidates from the subdistrict of assignment. \n7.   The Project promotes responsive local planning and administration. As a result, in areas with\nlarge populations of indigenous people, the improvement in capability for local planning will permit a\ngreater voice for participation of otherwise marginalized groups, and will legitimize social-ethnic\ndiversity by strengthening local institutions."], "metadata": {"Author": "ldm", "CreationDate": "D:20001010175110Z", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "ModDate": "D:20131112172552+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R205-00RRP.doc"}}
