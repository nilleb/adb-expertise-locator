INTRODUCTION \n1.  On 31 July 2006, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the second Governance \nand Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II).1 The purpose of GACAP II is to improve ADB\u2019s \nperformance in the implementation of its governance and anticorruption policies in the sectors \nand subsectors where ADB is active. The implementation of GACAP II will enable ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs), in partnership with ADB, to design and deliver better-\nquality projects and programs. ADB works with its DMCs to strengthen governance, develop \ncapacity, and reduce vulnerability to corruption. This technical assistance is designed to support \nthe implementation of GACAP II, and the related draft Capacity Development Medium-Term \nFramework and Action Plan.2 It will also continue ADB\u2019s support for the ADB\u2013Organization for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Anticorruption Initiative for Asia and the \nPacific  (the  ADB-OECD  Initiative).  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  for  the  TA  is  in \nAppendix 1.3 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Poor governance and corruption deter investment, waste resources and distort their \nallocation, undermine the credibility of public authorities, and increase insecurity. Moreover, the \npoor suffer most from the consequences of weak governance and corruption. Thus, to reduce \npoverty, governance must improve and corruption must diminish. Better governance means a \nmore stable economy, more credible DMC policies, and less resource leakage. For effective \npoverty reduction, therefore, ADB and its DMCs must accord high priority to strengthening \ngovernance. \n \n3.  The Review of the Implementation of the Governance and Anticorruption Policies (the \nReview)4 was completed in December 2005. The Review concluded that the policies had been \nimplemented only partially for two main reasons: first, the wide coverage of the policies has kept \nADB  from  responding  effectively  to  systemic  governance  and  corruption  issues,  given  the \ncompeting  demands  for  its  limited  resources;  and,  second,  with  its  qualified  success  in \nmainstreaming the policies, ADB has not been able to mitigate the governance and corruption \nrisks in sector work effectively. GACAP II is ADB\u2019s response to the findings of the Review. It \nrecognizes the importance of good governance, strong institutions, and reduced vulnerability to \ncorruption as key prerequisites for sustainable development.  \n \n4.  GACAP II reaffirms the findings of the Review and the need for action in the following \ncritical areas: (i) filling the significant gaps in compliance with the governance and anticorruption \npolicies and relevant operations manuals and project administration instructions; (ii) building \nstronger  partnerships  with  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  institutions,  particularly  in \ngaining access to country diagnostics and strengthening countries\u2019 procurement systems and \npublic financial management (PFM); (iii) applying institutional knowledge and country and sector \ndiagnostics more effectively to determine focus and priorities; and (iv) instituting more flexible, \nlonger-term institutional development arrangements to address systemic weaknesses in sector \ngovernance and corruption. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Manila (IN.216-06, 4 August). \n ", "2   \n \n5.  In 2005, after the review of the poverty reduction strategy, ADB introduced capacity \ndevelopment  as  a  new  thematic  priority.  Consistent  with  the  good  practice  standards  for \ncapacity development adopted recently by the OECD Development Assistance Committee, and \nADB\u2019s second medium-term strategy, the Capacity Development Medium-Term Framework and \nAction Plan (footnote 2) emphasizes the capacity of sector agencies and the networks and \npartnerships they engage with to deliver on their respective mandates. While numerous sector \nagencies have strived to develop capacity in the past, often with the support of ADB and other \ndonors, capacity assessments have often not been systematic, and the ad hoc efforts that \nresulted may or may not have addressed core capacity issues. \n \n6.  The ADB-OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific was launched in 1999. \nWithin its framework, countries from the region developed the Anti-corruption Action Plan for \nAsia-Pacific  (the  Action  Plan),  which  sets  goals  and  standards  for  sustainable  safeguards \nagainst corruption. The Action Plan is a landmark in regional cooperation against corruption. For \nthe first time, Asia-Pacific countries have agreed to act together to combat corruption more \neffectively through high anticorruption standards, a mechanism for assessing progress, dialogue \nwith  business  and  civil  society,  and  strong  regional  partnerships.  In  its  encouragement  of \ncontinual anticorruption reform, the Action Plan also enjoys significant and growing recognition \nfrom governments, international and donor organizations, civil society, and the private sector. \nThe  government  of  17  countries  and  jurisdictions  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region5 officially \nendorsed the Action Plan in 2001. The member countries of the Initiative have grown to 27,6 \nand other countries in Asia-Pacific have expressed interest in endorsing the Action Plan. The \nADB-OECD Initiative will begin its third implementation phase in 2007.  \n \n7.  The proposed regional technical assistance will support the implementation of GACAP II \nand ADB\u2019s capacity development action plan. It will also continue ADB\u2019s support for the ADB-\nOECD Initiative.  \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  The  proposed  regional  technical  assistance  will  have  three  interrelated  but  distinct \ncomponents for governance, capacity development, and continuing support for the ADB-OECD \nAnticorruption Initiative. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The proposed technical assistance will improve awareness among DMCs of the potential \nimpact of governance, institutional, and corruption risks on sustainable development. It will \nstrengthen the governance, institutional, capacity, and anticorruption orientation of up to five \ncountry partnership strategies (CPSs) to be prepared in 2007 and 2008. \n \n \n                                                 \n5  Bangladesh, Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Kyrgyz Republic, Malaysia, \nMongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Singapore, and Vanuatu.  \n6  The following joined after 2001: Kazakhstan (2002); Cambodia (2003); Hong Kong, China (2003); Australia (2003); \nPalau (2004); Viet Nam (2004); People\u2019s Republic of China (2005); Thailand (2005); Macao, China (2006); and \nSri Lanka (2006).   \n ", "  3\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Assessing public financial management, procurement systems, and corruption risks is \nan  important  starting  point  in  formulating  DMC  development  plans  and  ADB\u2019s  CPSs.  The \ngovernance component will focus on the development of methodologies and tools for PFM and \ncorruption risk assessments for CPSs, including subnational assessments where relevant and \nsector governance, institutional, and corruption risk assessments. These approaches will be \ntested, in partnership with DMCs, in up to five new CPSs, and in two sectors in each CPS.7 \nWhere practical, assessment tools will be based on currently available methodologies and will \nbe adapted in consultation with development partners. \n \n11.  While GACAP Il has three thematic priorities\u2014PFM, procurement, and corruption\u2014\ncountry procurement systems will not be assessed under the proposed technical assistance. \nSuch an assessment is currently being made in coordination with the World Bank and other \ndevelopment  partners  and  will  be  supported  by  a  separate  technical  assistance  being \nimplemented by the Central Operations Services Office.8 \n \n12.  The capacity development (CD) component will also focus on the preparation of CPSs \nwith  a  capacity  development  orientation.  Specific  activities  will  include  CD  baseline \nassessments and country orientation seminars. The proposed technical assistance will pilot-test \nthese methodologies in up to two CPSs, and will support the development of sector-specific \ncapacity development road maps. \n \n13.  The ADB-OECD Initiative strategy and work plan for 2007\u20132008 builds on the successful \napproach taken by the Action Plan signatories over the past years. The strategy articulates the \nInitiative\u2019s vision, role, and goals for 2007\u20132008. It takes into account recent changes in the \nanticorruption landscape in the Asia-Pacific region to provide member countries with targeted \nassistance  in  their  fight  against  corruption.  Key  elements  of  the  strategy  are:  (i)  ensuring \ncontinual  review  of  the  progress  of  reform  under  the  Action  Plan,  (ii)  strengthening  and \nexpanding  partnerships  in  the  fight  against  corruption,  and  (iii)  developing  capacity  for \nanticorruption activities. The third component of the proposed technical assistance will finance \nADB\u2019s continued support for this important flagship initiative in the fight against corruption in \nAsia and the Pacific.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA, estimated at $1.6 million, will be financed by a grant from ADB\u2019s \nTA  funding  program.  The  TA  proceeds  will  cover  consulting  services,  regional  meetings, \nworkshops, international travel, publications, and seminar and workshop costs. The detailed \ncost estimates for the proposed TA are in Appendix 2. For the anticorruption component, the \ncost estimates given in Appendix 2 reflect ADB\u2019s costs only. Besides ADB financing, at least an \nequal amount will come from OECD, and bilateral assistance will be sought to support country-\nspecific activities (such as country thematic reviews and country roundtables).  \n \n \n                                                 \n7  As many as 17 CPSs are expected to be started in 2006 and 2007. Those of Afghanistan, Samoa, and Sri Lanka \nhave been initially identified as possible test CPSs for initial GACAP ll application. \n8  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Supporting the Use of Country Procurement Systems. Manila (RETA 6317, \n$600,000, approved on 3 April). \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The proposed technical assistance will be implemented by ADB in consultation with \nselected country teams. The anticorruption component represents ADB\u2019s ongoing support for \nthe ADB-OECD Anticorruption Initiative. As has been the case in the past, both ADB and OECD \nwill  have  separate  secretariat  functions  and  the  regional  technical  assistance  will  be \nimplemented jointly under the guidance of the Initiative\u2019s steering group.   \n \n16.  The proposed technical assistance will require international consultants with skills in \ngovernance, public financial management, and anticorruption programs (25 person-months); \norganizational development (3 person-months); and institutional analysis (3 person-months). In \naddition, national governance consultants (54 person-months) and copy editors (30 person-days) \nwill provide support. The proposed project will also strengthen local capacity providers (i.e., for \nworkshops and CD assessments). Potential capacity providers will be identified during the \ninception mission and may be hired for the CD assessments and surveys. \n \n17.  Given the intermittence of the assignments and the variety of the skills required, all \nconsultants will be hired as individuals by ADB according to its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. Outline terms of reference for the consultancy services are in Appendix 3. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n18.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $1,600,000 on a grant basis for the Governance and Capacity \nDevelopment Initiative.   \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData \nDesign  Performance  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact       \nImproved DMC  Loan and TA project  RRPs and TA papers  Assumption  \nawareness of the  design and    \u2022 DMCs are committed \npotential impact of  implementation    to implementing \ngovernance,  arrangements in  governance, \ninstitutional, and  selected sectors  institutional, and \ncorruption risks on  incorporate the findings  corruption risk \nsustainable  of the governance,  mitigation strategies \ndevelopment   institutional, and  and new CD thematic \ncorruption risk  approaches. \nassessments.   \n   \n \nOutcome       \nStrengthened  Five new CPSs include  Quality-at-entry  Assumption \ngovernance,  an analysis of  assessments of CPSs  \u2022 Country senior \ninstitutional, capacity  governance,    management accepts \ndevelopment, and  institutional, and  GACAP II, biannual CD  ownership and \nanticorruption  corruption risks and  progress reports, ADB- leadership of \norientation of CPSs  capacity assessments  OECD Anticorruption  governance, \nusing appropriate  Initiative progress reports    institutional, and \nmethodologies.    corruption risk \n    mitigation plans and \nsupports continuous \nlearning of new \ninnovative approaches \nto CD. \n \nOutputs       \n1.
