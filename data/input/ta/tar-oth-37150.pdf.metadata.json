INTRODUCTION \n1.  On 16 January 2001, the Board of Directors approved the water policy1 of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  following  extensive  consultations  with  stakeholders  over  several \nyears.  In  addition  to  promoting  national  water  sector  reforms,  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement, and better water services for the poor, the policy commits ADB to regional and \nsubregional cooperation by assisting with water sector assessments and exchange of data, \nenhancing awareness and understanding of the water sector issues and needs of each country, \nand supporting water partnerships in ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs).  \n \n2.  On 10 December 2001, the Board approved the establishment of the Cooperation Fund \nfor the Water Sector.  The Fund is a multidonor umbrella facility to promote effective water \nmanagement policies and practices at the regional, subregional, and country levels and thereby \nto catalyze the implementation of ADB\u2019s water policy in the Asia and Pacific region.  The Fund will \nfinance a coherent program of activities designed to add value to the water projects carried out by \nADB\u2019s regional departments. The activities will increase synergy in ADB\u2019s water sector operations \nas a whole through better awareness, knowledge management, capacity building to support \ngeneric sector reforms, pilot demonstration, regional cooperation, monitoring, and coordination. \nThe Program aims to add value to ADB\u2019s water operations, and the Fund is not intended to \nreplace resources for regular operational activities.  \n \n3.  In December 2001, the  Government of the Netherlands made an initial contribution of \n$4 million  to  the  Fund  for  the  Program\u2019s  activities  in  2002,  for  which  technical  assistance \n(TA) 6031-REG was approved by ADB\u2019s Board.2 The initial contribution of $4 million has been \ncommitted, and the activities approved under the TA cover all six approved categories of the \nProgram,  including  (i)  promotion  and  public  awareness;  (ii)  knowledge  base  and  capacity \nbuilding; (iii) pilot and demonstrations; (iv) water partnerships; (v) regional events and initiatives; \nand (vi) program coordination, monitoring, and evaluation.  \n \n4.  The Government of the Netherlands made a second contribution to the Fund in December \n2002  in  the  amount  of  $4  million,  and  the  Government  of  Norway  has  agreed  to  provide \napproximately  $2  million  equivalent  over  3  years  starting  in  2003.  Donor  contributions  are \ngenerally  made  in  annual  tranches,  and  these  are  accessed  through  regional  TA  projects. \nADB's Water Sector Committee has recommended that two regional TAs be processed in 2003 to \nsupport  the  Program\u2019s  further  activities.  Accordingly,  TA  6093-REG  was  approved  by \nADB\u2019s Board to support the organization of the 3rd World Water Forum (WWF) held in Japan on \n16-23 March 2003.3 This proposed second TA has been prepared to support other activities of \nthe Program. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.4  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  The Board paper establishing the Fund identified three areas of priority assistance in the \nimplementation of ADB\u2019s water policy and the national water policies in the Asia and Pacific \nregion.  The first area is assistance to DMCs for water sector assessments and national water \naction agendas, to design and implement critical water sector reforms; and for demonstrating \nthese  reforms  through  pilot  initiatives  at  the  appropriate  levels,  involving  national  water \npartnerships and river basin organizations to ensure broad stakeholder participation.  The second \narea concerns revising ADB\u2019s business processes and strengthening its internal capacity to target \nthe water sector more holistically in its operations, with greater synergy through knowledge \nmanagement  and  collaboration  with  development  partners.  The  third  area  is  to  strengthen \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.  Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2002.

", "2       \nregional cooperation and awareness of important water issues, trends, and policies, and to \ncatalyze  a  new  generation  of  water  sector  investments  that  follow  from  effective  water \nmanagement policies and sector reforms.  The Millennium Development Goals adopted at the \nWorld Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 underline the urgency of \nhelping to improve the water security of the poor through safe drinking water, improved sanitation, \nwater  for  production  and  income  generation,  sustainable  environmental  management,  and \nreduced vulnerability to water-related disasters.      \n \n6.  To prioritize the use of the Fund in response to these needs, the Water Sector Committee \nhas  coordinated  the  Program\u2019s  activities  in  the  six  categories,  therein  supported  by \nfive subcommittees. A steering committee comprising directors of the concerned divisions in \nADB\u2019s regional departments and Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD) \nhas provided overall guidance and supervision to the Program\u2019s direction and activities, and has \napproved the detailed design and implementation arrangements of major components with an \nestimated cost of over $400,000. Upon the request of the steering committee, the Water Sector \nCommittee has prepared a medium-term strategy for activities financed from the Fund. This \nstrategy will be updated in response to evolving needs for assistance and lessons learned in \nDMCs and ADB in implementing ADB\u2019s water policy. The initial progress of the Program is \nsummarized  in  Appendix  2.  Progress  is  also  being  published  on  ADB\u2019s  water  web  site, \nhttp://www.adb.org/water. \n \n7.  Funding  requests  from  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments  for  activities  in  the  DMCs  have \nincreased significantly during the past year, and the main lesson learned in administering the \nFund is to organize the delegation of activities to regional departments in response to their \nspecific  demands,  while  maintaining  the  principle  of  additionality  in  the  use  of  the  Fund. \nProcedures and guidelines have been developed to accommodate and prioritize funding requests \nfrom DMCs and ADB staff. Coordination was established with the other multilateral development \nbanks that have similar funding facilities. Joint reviews of the Fund\u2019s activities by ADB and \ncontributing donors are expected to start in January 2004 in conjunction with ADB\u2019s second \n\u201cWater Week\u201d. A comprehensive review of the Fund is expected in 2005 in conjunction with the \ncomprehensive review of ADB\u2019s water policy implementation in that year. \n  \n8.  To promote water awareness and strengthen regional cooperation among DMCs and ADB \nin the water sector, the Program has supported the organization of the 3rd WWF in March 2003, \nwhich was convened to raise awareness of the critical water issues of the looming water crisis in \nthe 21st century, and to mobilize actions and resources to address these issues. President Chino \nled ADB\u2019s delegation to the 3rd WWF, and the results of ADB\u2019s participation are reported in a \nseparate Board information paper and published on ADB\u2019s water web site.  \n \n9.  Additional TA resources are required from the Fund to continue the Program\u2019s activities in \neach of the six categories, in accordance with the medium-term strategy prepared by the Water \nSector Committee, and in response to requests by ADB\u2019s regional departments.  \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output  \n10.  The proposed TA will continue the Program to promote effective water management \npolicies and practices at regional, subregional, and country levels and thereby catalyze the \nimplementation of ADB\u2019s water policy in the Asia and Pacific region, including within ADB itself. \nPoverty reduction is an objective crosscutting the proposed activities. The proposed Program \nactivities are targeted at a range of stakeholders in the region, including policy makers, planners, \nwater  service  providers  and  resource  managers,  ADB\u2019s  decision  makers,  civil  society \n ", "                  3 \n \norganizations, the media, the public at large, ADB staff, and development partners. The Program \nincludes follow-up initiatives to the 3rd WWF and will help ADB and DMCs achieve the MDGs \nrelated to water and poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The proposed TA comprises the following activities under the six Program categories.  \n \n12.  Promotion and Public Awareness.  ADB\u2019s  Water  Awareness  Program  that  was \nlaunched in 2002 under TA 6031 will be further developed to disseminate ADB\u2019s water policy and \nkey development messages in the water sector, increase  public awareness and stakeholder \ndialogue on water reform issues, improve press coverage of water issues and initiatives, educate \nyouth about the water crisis,  and support community-level water education  pilot activities in \nADB-financed water  projects in the DMCs. The Water Awareness Program will also support \nfollow-up initiatives to the 3rd WWF and promote water awareness activities as integral parts of \nnational water sector reform processes and of individual water sector projects in the DMCs.  \n \n13.  Knowledge Base and Capacity Building. Further support will be given to developing \nADB\u2019s water information and knowledge management systems to support its water operations, \nand to assist regional departments in undertaking water sector assessments and preparation of \nwater sector roadmaps. The systems will use the Internet as well as an intranet for ADB and \nDMC staff use, as part of ADB\u2019s knowledge management initiatives. Further support will be given \nto  comparative  analysis  of  water  sector  reforms  in  the  region,  including  (i)  water  sector \nassessments and the preparation of national water sector profiles and water sector roadmaps; \n(ii) studies on water governance, involving the establishment and performance of water sector \napex bodies, water policies, water laws, water sector action agendas, river basin organizations, \nand diagnostic methods to assess the capacity and performance of water sector agencies; and \n(iii) comparative studies to support follow-up initiatives to the 3rd WWF, as prioritized by the Water \nSector Committee.  A water sector capacity building program will be initiated to enhance core \ncompetencies in DMCs and ADB to implement water policy reforms.  \n \n14.  Pilot and Demonstration Activities. Support will be given for introducing and validating \nnew or innovative development approaches that are highly replicable. Most of this support will go \nto water project teams in ADB's regional departments, and will strengthen core operations \nincluding policy dialogue, country programming, and project preparation and implementation. \nSupport  will  also  be  given  to  field-based  applied  research  by  local  stakeholders,  including \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) and where possible using the regional technical advisory \ncommittees of the Global Water Partnership (GWP). Examples of preferred topics are (i) national \nand local reform processes, (ii) approaches to effective awareness and community education \nprograms, (iii) appropriate technology, (iv) gender and development approaches, (v) participatory \nand inclusive approaches, (vi) connecting services to the poor, and (vii) civil society actions for \ngood water governance. Pilot and demonstration activity results will guide and encourage positive \nchange among water sector stakeholders and will inform policy dialogue between ADB and the \nDMCs.  \n \n15.  Water Partnerships. Several activities will be supported on a demand basis to initiate or \nstrengthen national and regional water partnerships. Examples can include the Southeast Asia \nWater Utilities Network, the Network of Asian River Basin Organizations, the Gender in Water \nPartnership, and assistance to the countries of the lower Mekong River basin in the development \nof a flood management partnership in collaboration with the Mekong River Commission and the \nRoyal  Netherlands  Embassy  in  Hanoi.  The  development  of  national  and  regional  water \npartnerships can be supported in collaboration with the GWP. \n \n ", "4       \n16.  Regional  Events  and  Initiatives.  Support  will  be  provided  on  a  demand  basis  for \nADB\u2019s follow-up initiatives to the 3rd WWF in the DMCs, including the Water for Asian Cities \nProgram, the Water for the Poor\u2013Partnerships for Action, the Network of Asian River Basin \nOrganizations, the Gender in  Water Partnership, and other initiatives prioritized by the Water \nSector Committee. The level of support for each initiative will be determined by the demand in the \nDMCs. Support will also be provided to the organization of ADB\u2019s \u201cWater Weeks\u201d, for ADB\u2019s \nwater dialogue with NGOs, for dialogues among neighboring DMCs on common reform issues, \nand  for  thematic  workshops  and  subregional  water  forums  that  help  to  catalyze  the \nimplementation of ADB\u2019s water policy in the region, as requested by the regional departments.  \n \n17.  Program  Coordination,  Monitoring,  and  Evaluation.  The  monitoring  and  reporting \nsystem for the Fund will be further developed and maintained to provide updated information on \ninputs, outputs, outcomes, and financial management. ADB\u2019s water web site will play a central \nrole in the monitoring and reporting system. The comprehensive review of ADB\u2019s water policy \nimplementation in 2005 will be supported. An annual review of the Program\u2019s activities will also \nbe organized with the Fund\u2019s contributors in conjunction with ADB\u2019s \u201cWater Weeks\u201d. The water \nfocal point in RSDD will be supported to continue the administration, coordination, monitoring, \nand technical support of the Program. Coordination with the other multilateral development banks \nwill also be continued.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA, estimated at $4.3 million, will be financed on a grant basis by the \nCooperation  Fund  for  the  Water  Sector  through  the  channel  financing  facilities  of  the \ngovernments  of  the  Netherlands,  for  $3 million,  and  Norway,  for  $1.3  million,  and  will  be \nadministered by ADB.5  The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The TA will be implemented by ADB. The Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Social \nSector  Division  (RSAN)  of  RSDD,  in  association  with  concerned  divisions  in  the  regional \ndepartments and the Office of External Relations (OER), will be responsible for all TA activities. \nThe Water Sector Committee will serve as the TA team, in consultation with the Water Sector \nNetwork. The lead water resources specialist of RSAN will coordinate the team\u2019s activities. TA \nactivities  can  be  proposed  by  government  agencies  and  NGOs  in  the  DMCs,  by  other \ndevelopment partners, and by ADB staff. Activity proposals will be reviewed and prioritized by the \nWater Sector Committee according to criteria and procedures published on ADB\u2019s water web site. \nThe  initiation  and  implementation  of  TA  activities  will  be  delegated  to  operations  divisions \nconcerned as appropriate, with administrative and technical support provided by the water focal \npoint in RSAN. The existing steering committee comprising directors of the concerned divisions in \nADB\u2019s regional departments, OER, and RSDD will supervise the TA activities and use of the \nFund,  including  its  medium-term  strategy,  and  will  approve  the  detailed  design  and \nimplementation arrangements of major components of the TA prior to their commencement.6  \n \n20.  The water focal point in RSAN will serve as TA office. Approximately 50 person-months of \ninternational and 173 person-months of domestic consultants will be needed for the regional \n                                                 \n5  The governments of the DMCs that will participate in the TA are expected to provide in-kind contributions to facilitate \nimplementation of TA activities taking place in them, such as consultation and training workshops and pilot \ndemonstration activities.  \n6  The steering committee may invite representatives of other ADB  departments/divisions, e.g., the private sector \noperations department, evaluation divisions, and economics and research divisions, to participate in its meetings as \nappropriate. Major components are defined as having a cost estimate of more than $400,000, and these components \nare indicated in the outline terms of reference in Appendix 4. \n ", "                  5 \n \ndepartments and RSAN to implement the activities of the TA.7 The required areas of expertise \nare expected to include water policy and legal reform, institutional development, capacity building, \nknowledge management, information systems, water supply and sanitation, integrated water \nresources  management  and  river  basin  organizations,  flood  management  and  insurance, \nmanaging environmental flows in rivers, watershed management, national poverty reduction \nstrategies,  gender  and  development,  public  awareness  and  consultations,  community \norganizations, dams and development, public-private partnerships, tariff reform and regulatory \nframeworks, financing for water infrastructure and services, and related water sector reform \nareas. Coordination and implementation of the TA will be supported by a water policy adviser, \nwater operations adviser, contracts administrator, finance manager, database analyst, web site \nmanager, and administrative assistant, financed by the TA. Further short-term international and \ndomestic consultants may be recruited to fill gaps in the TA team\u2019s expertise. The required \nconsultants will mostly be recruited as individuals.8 In the case of activity proposals selected by \nthe Water Sector Committee for follow-up initiatives to the 3rd WWF, pilot and demonstration \nactivities, water partnership support, and for regional events and initiatives, consulting services by \ninternational and national organizations and NGOs will be directly selected. ADB will recruit the \nconsultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the recruitment of domestic consultants. Outline terms of reference are \nshown in Appendix 4. Equipment and materials to be financed by the TA will be procured by the \nconsultants or ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement or other procedures \nacceptable to ADB.9  \n \n21.  Participation  in  the  TA  is  open  to  all  of  ADB\u2019s  DMCs.  Each  participating  DMC  will \ndesignate the water sector apex body, or agency assigned to coordinate water sector activities, \nas the national counterpart agency; this agency will coordinate the country\u2019s participation in the \nTA activities, drawing on the interest and expertise of relevant water stakeholders in the country, \nincluding those from central and provincial agencies, river basins, the private sector, NGOs, the \nacademe, research and professional organizations, and other interested parties. DMCs can make \nproposals for TA activities through the regional departments in ADB for review and prioritization \nby ADB\u2019s Water Sector Committee. \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 18 months, commencing in September 2003 \nand ending in February 2005. Progress reports on the Program and use of the Fund will be \nprepared by the water focal point in RSAN on a six-monthly basis in collaboration with the Office \nof Cofinancing Operations. TA activities will be monitored and reports made available through the \nADB water web site.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n23.

The first phase of the Water Awareness Program \n(WAP) has supported the participation of the Asian Development Bank  (ADB) in the World \nSummit on Sustainable Development and the 3rd World Water Forum (WWF). Outputs included \na series of television documentaries, web site development (http://www.adb.org/water), briefs on \nwater  issues,  publicity  materials,  public  service  announcements,  print  publications,  media \nrelations, and exhibitions.  More than 18,000 WAP outputs were distributed at the 3rd WWF. \nSeveral improvements and updates on the web site continue since its launching in 2002. Plans \nhave been initiated for a second phase of the WAP.   \n \n2.    Knowledge Base and Capacity Building. Several initiatives were undertaken to start \nknowledge management, including the formation of the Water Sector Network, a participatory \ncapacity assessment, the design of a water information system for use by ADB and developing \nmember country (DMC) staff in support of ADB\u2019s water operations, and comparative studies on \nseveral topics including water in Asian cities. Guidelines were also developed for water sector \nroadmaps in DMCs.  \n \n3.    Pilot and Demonstration Activities.  Pilot and demonstration activities (PDAs) were \ninitiated in 2002 and the demand from ADB\u2019s regional departments for support for such activities \nhas grown rapidly. Figures A2.1-A2.3 show the distribution of pilot and demonstration activities \napproved by the Water Sector Committee, by subregion, subsector, and type. After gaining \nexperience with the first batch of activities, the Water Sector Committee adopted guidelines for \nselection of such activities in May 2003. \n     \nFigure A2.1: Regional Distribution of PDAs (%) \nSouth Asia\n30%\nMekong\n11%\nEast and Central \nAsia\n11%\nSoutheast Asia\n17%\nPacific\n31%\n \nFigure A2.2: Subsectoral Distribution of PDAs (%) \nWater Supply and \nSanitation Services Water Resources \n16% Management\n21%\nWastewater \nManagement Irrigation \n43% Management\n20%\n \n ", "10      Appendix 2         \nFigure A2.3: Distribution of PDAs by Type (%) \nNational or Local \nWater Services for  Policy Reform \nthe Poor Process\n21% 17%\nInstitutional \nDevelopment\n11%\nGender and \nDevelopment  Awareness Programs\nApproaches 32%\n19%\n \n \n \n4.    Water Partnerships. Several activities were undertaken to initiate or strengthen national \nand regional water partnerships in the Pacific, Southeast Asia, and Mekong. In the Pacific \nregion, an existing partnership of atoll island countries affected by climate change and the rise \nin sea level was supported through a pilot study on national water resources assessment and \ncoastal zone planning for Kiribati.  Support was provided to the Global Water Partnership \nSoutheast Asia Technical Advisory Committee for strengthening community-based institutions \nthat have demonstrated replicable and sustainable strategies in integrated water resources \nmanagement in five countries in the region and for documenting their activities. Funds were \nallocated  to  support  the  countries  of  the  lower  Mekong  River  basin  in  their  new  flood \nmanagement initiative, with ADB support focusing on the poverty reduction interventions as part \nof the initiative.   \n \n5.    Regional  Events  and  Initiatives.  The  participation  of  ADB  in  the  3rd  WWF  was \nsupported to help promote the mi plementation of ADB\u2019s water policy in the region. ADB\u2019s \nparticipation (i) showcased projects in DMCs; (ii) provided knowledge, experience, and lessons \nlearned; (iii) supported DMCs to participate and learn; (iv) strengthened collaboration with \npartners; and (v) increased awareness and raised ADB\u2019s profile. ADB organized five themes: \n(i) Water and Poverty, (ii) Water and Cities, (iii) Water in Small Island Countries, (iv) Poverty and \nFloods, and (v) Regional Cooperation for Shared Water Resources Management in central Asia.  \nADB organized 15 thematic sessions, participated in the World Panel on Financing Water \nInfrastructure, and convened the Water Development Partners Panel. ADB also participated in \nand supported regional initiatives, such as on water rights; dialogue for water, food, and \nenvironment; and water governance. \n \n6.   Program  Coordination,  Monitoring,  and  Evaluation.  The  use  of  the  Fund  is \ncoordinated by the Water Sector Committee and supported by ADB\u2019s water focal point located \nin  the  Agriculture,  Natural  Resources  and  Social  Sectors  Division,  according  to  the \nmedium-term strategy for the Fund. A steering committee comprising directors of the concerned \noperations divisions in ADB\u2019s regional departments provides overall guidance and supervision \nto the Program activities, and approves the detailed design and implementation arrangements \nof major Program components.

The outline terms of reference for consultants describe the main tasks in each of the \nsix categories of the program of activities to promote effective water management policies and \npractices in the region and thereby catalyze implementation of the water policy of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in the Asia and Pacific region. The six categories are promotion and \npublic  awareness;  knowledge  base  and  capacity  building;  pilot  demonstration;  water \npartnerships;  regional  events  and  initiatives;  and  program  coordination,  monitoring,  and \nevaluation.  Poverty  reduction  is  a  crosscutting  priority  in  all  tasks.  ADB\u2019s  Water  Sector \nCommittee will guide the program of activities, which are coordinated by the Agriculture, Natural \nResources, and Social Sector Division (RSAN). \n \nA.  Promotion and Public Awareness  \n2.  An international  public relations specialist will be engaged on an individual basis for \n1 year to manage the second phase of ADB\u2019s water awareness program (WAP). The WAP\u2019s \nobjectives, in continuation of  its first phase, are to (i) promote public understanding of water \nissues and disseminate ADB\u2019s water policy, (ii) facilitate dialogue among water stakeholders on \nthe water reform agenda in the region, (iii) help educate children and youth on water issues and \ntheir role in finding solutions, and (iv) support small pilot and demonstration activities for \ncommunity water education.   \n \n3.  In its second phase, the WAP will continue to use a range of suitable tools and activities \nto communicate a range of messages effectively to different target audiences, including (i) water \nsector stakeholders and decision makers, (ii) children and youth, (iii) poor communities, and \n(iv) the general public in the Asia and Pacific region. The WAP will also help to strengthen \nADB\u2019s collaboration with the media in reaching these target audiences. The development \nmessages will be derived from ADB\u2019s water policy, from the results of the 3rd World Water \nForum (WWF), and from other key water themes in coordination with development partners.  \n \n4.  The  tools  and  activities  will  include  ADB\u2019s  water  web  site,  a  regional  electronic \nnewsletter, print publications, publicity materials and photographs, television documentaries and \nvideo productions, public service announcements, media relations and networking, exhibitions, \npilot  community  education  activities,  other  pilot  activities  to  promote  water  awareness  in \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs), and other complementary activities as determined by the \nWater Sector Committee and the WAP team. The design and implementation arrangements of \nthe second phase of WAP will be approved by the technical assistance (TA) steering committee \nprior to the start of implementation. \n \n5.  To help implement the WAP, international specialists (with expertise in public and media \nrelations;  multimedia  production;  and  information,  education,  and  communication)  will  be \nengaged on an individual basis to work in the WAP team. They will work together with domestic \nconsultants, including a web site manager, media relations and  networking specialists, and \nother  specialists  as  needed,  who  will  also  be  engaged  on  an  individual  basis.  In  close \ncollaboration with ADB\u2019s Office of External Relations, the Water Sector Committee and network, \nand other operations staff in the regional departments, the WAP team will work in RSAN to \nundertake the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Assist ADB staff in the further development and effective use of key development \nmessages related to water sector issues and themes, covering water and poverty \nreduction, effective water policies; issues related to water service delivery and \n ", "                                                                                                                         Appendix 4  15\nwater resources management; cross-cutting subjects like gender, water rights, \nprivate sector participation, and financing; thematic issues like water quality, \ndams, and development; and supporting topics in subsectors like groundwater \nmanagement, flood management, and watershed management. \n(ii)  Assist  ADB  regional  department  staff  in  conducting  pilot  and  demonstration \nactivities in DMCs in relation to water sector reforms or water-related project \npreparation and implementation.  \n(iii)  Assist  ADB  regional  department  staff  in  conducting  pilot  and  demonstration \nactivities on community water education as part of ADB-financed water projects, \nfocusing on poor communities that have taken initiatives to improve water-related \nservices for the poor and on the sustainable management of water resources. \n(iv)  Assist ADB regional department staff in conducting in DMCs media workshops \nfor journalists reporting on water issues, and support networking among such \njournalists in the region. \n(v)  Assist  ADB  in  further  developing  and  managing  its  water  web  site  as  an \nintegrated  tool  for  providing  information,  raising  awareness,  encouraging \nnetworking, and supporting knowledge management. \n(vi)  Develop and disseminate water sector information and knowledge in a series of \nprint publications, including the results from studies conducted in connection with \nADB-organized sessions at the 3rd  WWF, and the results of other activities \nsupported by the Fund, including a series of publications, reports, and briefs on \nimportant water issues and messages. \n(vii)  Develop  and  disseminate  publicity  materials  to  support  water  awareness  in \ninterested DMCs and in the Asia and Pacific region as a whole.  \n(viii)  Assist ADB in developing and placing a series of articles on important  water \nissues in national, regional, and international media, and in the ADB Review. \n(ix)  Assist  ADB  in  launching  a  regional  electronic  water  newsletter  to  provide \ninformation on water sector reforms in the region and facilitate dialogue among \nwater stakeholders on important water sector issues, in connection with ADB\u2019s \nwater web site. \n(x)  Assist ADB in the distribution of the television documentaries produced under the \nfirst phase of the WAP. \n(xi)  Produce two video documentaries on water issues, including (a) lessons learned \nfrom  implementing  ADB\u2019s  water  policy,  and  (b)  new  approaches  to  flood \nmanagement. \n(xii)  Produce  and  place  ADB  public  service  announcements  for  regional  and \ninternational  broadcasters  based  on  the  television  documentaries  and  video \nproductions. \n(xiii)  Organize exhibitions at regional and international events as needed. \n(xiv)  Assist  ADB  in  developing  partnership  programs  with  other  organizations  to \npromote and catalyze water awareness activities in the Asia and Pacific region. \n(xv)  Manage and update ADB\u2019s water reference center as the repository of print \npublications, manuals, guidelines, publicity materials, reports, films and television \ndocumentaries, reports, and briefs on important water sector issues for use by \nADB\u2019s Water Sector Committee, network, and consultants. \n \n6.  Consulting  services  for  the  second  phase  of  WAP  are  expected  to  comprise \napproximately  18  person-months  of  international  and  32  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants. A detailed work plan will be submitted to the steering committee for endorsement.  \n \n ", "16      Appendix 4        \n7.  The subsequent third phase of the WAP will be supporting similar type of activities, and \nwill be finalized as further contributions to the Fund are received. The terms of reference for the \nthird phase will be determined after a review of the second phase results, and consultant \nengagements will be processed accordingly at that time. \n \nB.  Knowledge Base and Capacity Building  \n8.  International water policy and institutional development specialists will be engaged on an \nindividual and intermittent basis to do the following: \n \n(i)  Advise staff in ADB\u2019s regional departments on supporting country water sector \nassessments, strategies, policy dialogue, and reforms.  \n(ii)  Conduct thematic and comparative analyses of ongoing water sector reforms in \nthe region, including studies on water governance, involving the establishment \nand performance of water sector apex bodies, water policies, water laws, water \nsector action agendas, river basin organizations, regulatory bodies, and other \nwater institutions. \n(iii)  Organize capacity development programs for ADB and DMC staff on important \nwater issues and skills, drawing on the results of the capacity and training needs \nassessments carried out in 2002, including training seminars and workshops, \nparticipation  in  training  courses,  recommendations  for  country  exchange \ndialogues on priority water sector reform topics, the strengthening of ADB\u2019s water \nfocal point, and the development of regional research and capacity building \nnetworks in accordance with ADB\u2019s water policy. \n(iv)  Conduct  follow-up  studies  building  on  the  results  of  the  3rd  WWF,  e.g.,  in \nfinancing of water infrastructure, the role of small-scale independent service \nproviders, and other subjects as determined by the Water Sector Committee.   \n \n9.  The  international  specialists  will  work  with  full-time  domestic  specialists  in  RSAN, \nincluding a water policy adviser and a water operations adviser, who will also be engaged on an \nindividual basis. These domestic specialists will also be responsible to develop existing ADB \ndata bases into an integrated water sector information system for use by ADB and DMC staff, \nthrough the intranet and Internet, to support ADB\u2019s water operations. The system will provide \nwater sector statistics by DMC, including national water sector profiles, policies, laws, and \nsector roadmaps for DMCs; a compilation of useful practices in key water sector reform topics \nand on poverty reduction in water sector operations; and links to  water knowledge centers \noutside  ADB.  These  systems  will  be  developed  as  part  of  a  Water  Net  under  ADB\u2019s \n\u201ccommunities of practice\u201d approach to knowledge management. \n \n10.  Services  for  knowledge  base  and  capacity  building  are  expected  to  comprise \napproximately  12  person-months  of  international  and  42  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants.  \n \nC.  Pilot and Demonstration Activities \n11.  International  and/or  domestic  short-term  water  sector  specialists  (with  expertise  as \nrequired)  will  be  engaged  on  an  individual  basis  to  support  regional  department  staff  in \nconducting  pilot  and  demonstration  activities  (PDAs)  in  DMCs,  according  to  guidelines \ndeveloped  by  the  Water  Sector  Committee.  PDAs  will  mostly  complement  ADB  water \noperations. They should be driven by the needs of ADB\u2019s regional departments and project \nofficers, who develop the proposals for activities to be supported by the Fund.  \n ", "                                                                                                                         Appendix 4  17\n \n12.  Water sector roadmaps prepared under ADB\u2019s country strategy and program process \nhighlight  expected  changes  and  achievements  in  the  water  sector.  These  development \nexpectations may require the introduction of new ideas, technologies, and approaches to the \nsector. The changes may be at the national level (e.g., achieving national policy and reform \noutcomes)  down  to  the  local  level  (e.g.,  achieving  widespread  application  of  market-level \ntechnologies, approaches, and arrangements). Changes may also be possible in more than one \ncountry. Bringing innovation to bear involves (i) research and experimentation to validate the \ninnovation, and (ii) advocacy to ensure decision makers and other stakeholders agree to the \nchanges. The PDAs supported by the Fund should therefore introduce and validate new or \ninnovative approaches that are highly replicable.  \n \n13.  PDAs will mostly involve consultant services to support ADB missions in developing, \nvalidating, and demonstrating new approaches during the processing and implementation of \nproject preparation and advisory TA, and loan-financed  investment  projects.  Activities  can \ninclude field-based applied research and demonstration, which are likely to be proposed by local \nstakeholders, including NGOs.       \n \n14.  PDAs are generally expected to test or highlight new approaches, confirm their efficacy, \nand then implement or plan a replication program. PDAs could be processed in connection with \nchanges in (i) national or local water policy reform processes, (ii) water awareness program \napproaches,  (iii)  appropriate  technology,  (iv)  gender  and  development  approaches, \n(v) participatory and inclusive approaches and multistakeholder representation, (vi) connecting \nservices to the poor, and (vii) other changes catalyzed by ADB\u2019s water policy.  PDAs can be \nrelated to the management of water resources and the delivery of water services. \n \n15.  The  maximum  amount  to  be  drawn  from  the  Fund  will  normally  not  exceed \n$50,000 equivalent. The average implementation period for a PDA is expected to be 6 months, \nand the maximum allowable implementation period is 12 months. PDAs should not duplicate \nongoing or pipelined activity in the DMC. PDAs should be directly relevant to the \u201csector \noutcomes\u201d cited in the country strategy program/country strategy program updates for the DMC. \nIf the start of a PDA is unduly delayed, the Water Sector Committee can decide that the Funds \ncommitted will be reallocated to other PDAs on the waiting list. \n \n16.  In prioritizing between requests for PDAs, the Water Sector Committee will consider the \nfollowing criteria (i) originality, (ii) replicability, (iii) potential replicability (in case of pilot test), \n(iv) lessons learned, (v) pro-poor focus, (vi) participatory development and gender  inclusion, \n(vii) operations support, (viii) collaborative approach using partnerships, (ix) technically strong \ndesign, and (x) consistency with ADB\u2019s water policy. \n \n17.  The type and duration of consulting inputs for the pilot and demonstration activities will \nbe provided in the activity proposals to be submitted by concerned departments in ADB during \nTA implementation.  \n ", "18      Appendix 4        \n \nD.  Water Partnerships \n18.  International and/or domestic short-term water sector specialists will be engaged to \nassist regional department staff in providing support to selected activities of national or regional \nwater partnerships, which are expected to include the following: \n \n(i)  national and subregional water partnerships established on the model and with \nsupport of the Global Water Partnership; \n(ii)  the Southeast Asia Water Utilities Network established in 2002; \n(iii)  the Network of Asian River Basin Organizations,  established at the 3rd WWF; \n(iv)  the Gender in Water Partnership, announced at the 3rd WWF; and \n(v)  the  Mekong  Flood  Management  Partnership  among  countries  of  the  lower \nMekong River basin, in collaboration with the Royal Netherlands Embassy in \nHanoi and other development partners. \n \n19.  The type and duration of consulting inputs for the water partnership support activities will \nbe provided in the proposals to be submitted by concerned departments in ADB during TA \nimplementation.  \n \nE.
