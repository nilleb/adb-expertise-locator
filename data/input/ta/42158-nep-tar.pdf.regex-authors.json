INTRODUCTION \n1.  Nepal is currently undergoing a dramatic political transition in which the debate on \nfederalism occupies center stage. A key component of this debate involves the nature of local \ngovernance and, more broadly, how communities participate in development. To strengthen \nlocal governance and community development in Nepal, in 2008 the Government of Nepal \nformulated  the  Local  Governance  and  Community  Development  Program,  which  is  being \nsupported by several development partners, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 \n \n2.  The  objectives  of  the  LGCDP  are  varied,  and  include  (i)  empowering  citizens  and \ncommunities to hold local bodies accountable for service delivery;2 (ii) improving the capacity of \nlocal bodies to manage resources and deliver basic services in an inclusive and equitable \nmanner; and (iii) strengthening policy, institutional, and legal frameworks for decentralization, \ndevolution, and community development. Given the extensive work facing the LGCDP, and the \nfinancing gaps for specific capacity development efforts, the Government has requested that \nADB provide technical assistance (TA) to support the LGCDP. The Government has reviewed \nthe TA proposal,3 and concurs with the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \ncost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consultants and counterpart support.4 \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The political changes taking place in Nepal are producing a heightened awareness of \nthe need to focus on inclusiveness and gender equality. The Constituent Assembly is debating \nthe constitution for a new federal Nepal, but there have been no local elected representatives \nsince 2002, and local service delivery is neither effective nor inclusive. Recipients of services \nhave few institutionalized measures by which they can hold service providers to account, and \nthis further limits the accountability of local bodies, which typically have limited resources.5 \n \n4.  The Government formulated the LGCDP in 2008 largely to address these issues. The \nLGCDP is supported by multiple development partners, with ADB as the primary donor. While \nsome development partners are providing relevant TA to the LGCDP program coordination unit \n(PCU), many additional areas require support if the objectives of the national program are to be \nmet (para 2). \n \n5.  This proposed ADB TA supports two critical needs: (i) addressing own-source revenue \nand  other  constraints  of  municipalities  (while  LGCDP  intends  to  enhance  the  own-source \nrevenue generation capacity of all local bodies, the program's focus on key priorities\u2014such as \n                                                \n1  ADB's support to the LGCDP is being provided through ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President \nto the Board of Directors on a Proposed Program Cluster and Grant for Subprogram 1 to the Federal Democratic \nRepublic of Nepal for the Governance Support Program. Manila (Grant 0118-NEP, $106.3 million, approved on 22 \nOctober). The Ministry of Local Development is the executing agency. \n2  These local bodies include 3,915 village development committees, 58 municipalities, and 75 district development \ncommittees. \n3  A fact-finding mission visited Kathmandu twice (28 June\u20133 July 2009 and 31 July\u20134 August 2009) to consult with \ngovernment officials on the specifications of the TA, and on the relevant measures and costs related to its \ncomponents. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 20 August 2009. \n5  Fiscal transfers from Kathmandu are the principal source of revenue of all local bodies in Nepal. In general, local \nbodies are able to generate only about a quarter of their resource requirements, with substantial variation in their \nresource endowments (e.g., Kathmandu district alone collects 40% of all revenue in the country, with Parsa district, \nwhich handles much of Nepal\u2019s overland imports from India, collecting another 20%). \n ", "2   \nblock grant levels and mechanisms\u2014has reduced the priority given to this issue);6 and (ii) \nsupporting work undertaken by the Ministry of Local Development (MLD) PCU on environmental \nand social safeguards in the LGCDP (as mandated by the Environment Protection Act, 1997, \nand its regulations), which are to be in place in all local development work7 and procurement \npractices, both with respect to the LGCDP and at the local-body level.8  \n \n6.  These issues, and the need to address them with a degree of urgency, have resulted in \nthe Government seeking assistance from ADB. Some specific capacity-building needs in the \nLGCDP  have  not  been  supported  by  Nepal\u2019s  development  partners;  given  ADB's  sizable \ncommitment to funding the LGCDP, and its requirements with respect to application of the \nenvironmental and social safeguards framework that it helped develop, the support provided \nthrough this TA is critical.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The overall impact of the TA will be effective support to the development objectives of \nthe  LGCDP,  which  focus  on  improved  service  delivery  by  local  bodies.  Key  performance \nindicators include (i) greater fiscal space in selected municipalities as a result of private sector \nparticipation in service delivery (and, as such, reduced costs for such delivery from own funds); \n(ii) accurate design and application of environmental and social safeguards; (iii) more accurate \napplication  of  procurement  guidelines  for  the  LGCDP,  and  improved  procurement-related \nguidance at the local-body level; and (iv) establishment and implementation of a corporate \naccounting system in selected municipalities. \n \n8.  The primary outcome of the TA will be increased capacity of MLD and local bodies \n(including select municipalities) to effectively implement the LGCDP. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  TA  will  have  the  following  primary  outputs:  (i)  opportunities  for  private  sector \nparticipation  identified  and  suitable  projects  developed;  (ii)  corporate  accounting  system \ninstituted  in  select  municipalities;  (iii)  environmental  and  social  safeguards  framework \noperationalized; and (iv) procurement guidelines for the LGCDP and for local bodies developed \nand operationalized. \n \n10.  The proposed TA has two components: \n \n(i)  Component  1. Support to selected municipalities9 to: (i) increase their own-\nsource revenues and provide services more effectively and efficiently through \n                                                \n6  This is due largely to a combination of capacity constraints at the executing agency and the expediency of finalizing \nexpanded block grant protocols for fiscal transfers to district and village development committees. \n7  Subprogram 1 of the Governance Support Program Cluster requires that local bodies adhere to the environmental \nand social safeguards framework. To help local bodies access LGCDP resources, assistance to the Environment \nDivision of the Ministry of Local Development (the executing agency) is needed. \n8  This element directly addresses a key concern that development partners currently have about procurement issues \nin Nepal. \n9  Selection of municipalities for greater private sector participation will be made through discussions with United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP). This TA will link to the UNDP project on Public\u2013Private Partnerships for \nthe Urban Environment (PPPUE), and with the Municipality Planning Division of MLD for corporate accounting \nstandards. The South Asia Financial Sector, Public Management, and Trade Division (SAFM) has made a separate \n ", "  3 \ngreater involvement of the private sector in small-scale projects,10 which will help \nthese local bodies reduce costs in many areas as well as increase revenue \ncollection and services; and (ii) institute corporate accounting in municipalities, \nnow  that  intergovernmental  fiscal  arrangements  require  a  greater  degree  of \naccountability and transparency in local-level financial management. This will \nallow municipalities to increase the transparency of their operations, which is a \nkey goal of the LGCDP.  \n(ii)  Component 2. Support to the MLD PCU: (i) to implement the environmental and \nsocial safeguards framework, as mandated in the LGCDP; and (ii) to strengthen \nthe  procurement  capacities  of  the  PCU,  and  provide  relevant  guidance  on \nprocurement to local bodies. \n \n11.  ADB has required that the environmental and social safeguards framework be applied in \nthe LGCDP; after almost a year of program implementation, MLD clearly lacks the capacity to \ndo so itself. Increased clarity regarding implementation of the framework at the central level will \nassist local bodies as well; this is also true of the support to be provided on procurement.  \n \n12.  Both components are specifically linked to the LGCDP objectives. LGCDP not only \nfocuses on transparency in financial transactions in local bodies, but both output 3 and the \nimplementation arrangements mention  involving the private sector  to ensure that the own-\nsource  revenues  of  local  bodies\u2014including  municipalities\u2014are  enhanced. 11 Support  for \nimplementation of the environmental and social safeguards framework is critical because ADB \nhas mandated that all local development programs that utilize block grants transferred from the \ncenter  apply  the  environmental  and  social  safeguards  framework  with  due  regard  to  the \nEnvironment Protection Act, 1997. \n \n13.  The TA will have the following key activities: (i) through an administrative arrangement \nwith United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)\u2014and, in particular, its project on Public\u2013\nPrivate  Partnerships  for  Urban  Environment  (PPPUE)\u2014engage  municipalities  in  fostering \ngreater linkages with the private sector and fund relevant small-scale projects in municipalities;12 \n                                                                                                                                                       \nproject proposal to the Australian Agency for International Development\u2013ADB Development Partnership Facility for \nSouth Asia (ADB. 2006. Establishing the Australia\u2013ADB South Asia Development Partnership Facility. Manila), \nwhich proposes similar support for municipalities, but these arrangements will cover different municipalities through \ndifferent modalities, with no duplication or overlap.  \n10 The projects themselves will be focused on small-scale and basic municipality functions (such as solid waste and \ndrainage management services, and maintenance of parks and vegetable markets) that will be contracted to the \nprivate sector (primarily members of the local chamber of commerce). In larger municipalities, private sector \ninvolvement could extend to support for service delivery (e.g., billing, collection, and complaint registration). The TA \nincorporates a seed fund of $120,000 for these purposes, including 7% for UNDP project management services. \n11 The LGCDP document (Government of Nepal. Local Governance and Community Development Program. July \n2008. Kathmandu) specifies that this participation be in the form of public\u2013private partnerships but there is currently \nno overarching policy and legal framework on public\u2013private partnerships in Nepal.  \n12 This component of the TA is proposed to be implemented through UNDP because (i) the UNDP project has \nsuccessfully used this approach in several municipalities; (ii) that project has a ground-based system that this TA \ncan draw upon; (iii) pooling of resources will provide municipalities with better access to resources; and (iv) \nengagement  by  municipalities  in  these  projects  will  improve  if  duplication  among  development  partners  is \neliminated. In this regard, the cooperation between ADB and UNDP will take the form of an administrative \narrangement that follows the memorandum of understanding (MOU) already agreed upon by ADB and UNDP. The \nMOU,  which will guide the arrangement, contains specific provisions regarding the PPPUE (e.g., ADB will \nparticipate in the PPPUE steering committee, and UNDP will receive 7% for project management costs).The \narrangement permits UNDP to procure goods and services (including consulting services) in accordance with \nUNDP. 2006.

Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $550,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The Government will provide the \nequivalent of $50,000 to finance part of the local currency costs for counterpart staff, office \nfacilities, administrative support, facilitation for meetings, etc. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MLD is the executing agency for the LGCDP and this TA project. Selected municipalities \nwill implement component 1 (specified in para. 10) as per UNDP's project on PPPUE, which has \nsuccessfully implemented similar initiatives in several municipalities, and ADB funding will be \nchanneled through UNDP for this TA activity. Similarly, the PCU will implement component 2 in \nclose  coordination  with  the  LGCDP  National  Advisory  Committee,  which  includes \nrepresentatives from MLD and development partners supporting the LGCDP.13 The Government \nwill provide in-kind support for the ADB TA (para. 14). UNDP and Denmark are providing direct \nsupport for PCU operations as part of their TA to the LGCDP, and component 2 of the TA will fill \ngaps in this support.  \n \n16.  Consulting services required for the TA include (i) 180 person-months of engagement \nwith the private sector, (ii) 18 person-months of environment specialist services, (iii) 18 person-\nmonths of procurement specialist services, and (iv) 6 person-months of corporate accounting \nexpert services. Individual consultants will be recruited to provide the required consulting inputs. \nThe terms of reference of the consultants are in Appendix 3. Selection of the consultants will be \ndone by (i) UNDP for consulting expertise relating to engagement with the private sector, and \nusage of seed funds for innovative private sector participation though its existing projects on \nPPPUE in accordance with the UNDP Procurement Manual (User Guide) (footnote 12); and (ii) \nADB in consultation with MLD, for all others in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n17.  Except as set forth in footnote 12, necessary equipment for this TA will be procured \nusing the shopping method, and will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). At the end of the TA, all equipment will be retained by \nthe agencies that are using them. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with \nADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.14 The TA is expected to be implemented \nover 18 months, from October 2009 to March 2011. \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \nGuide for Procurement of Goods, Equipment, and Services Using Funds Transferred by the Asian Development \nBank to UNDP under the Memorandum of Understanding between ADB and UNDP. Manila.  \n13 These development partners include the Canadian International Development Agency, Denmark, the Department \nfor International Development of the United Kingdom, Norway, and the Swiss Agency for Development and \nCooperation. \n14  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n ", "  5 \n18.  The TA performance will be periodically appraised by ADB review missions, MLD staff, \nand other development partners. A significant part of the monitoring and evaluation system will \nrely on the regular monitoring that will be undertaken through the LGCDP (and ADB's support \nprogram); this will be done through the monitoring and evaluation protocols that are specified in \nthe joint financing arrangement for the LGCDP, which was signed in early September 2009. \nUNDP will review the implementation progress of those parts of the TA for which it will receive \nfunds from ADB. These review arrangements will be specified in the administrative arrangement \nto be prepared for this component of the TA. ADB will participate in such reviews. \n \nE.  Assumptions and Risks \n19.  The following assumptions are inherent in the TA: (i) that nongovernment organizations \nand other groups monitor for, and impartially bring to light instances of, poor service delivery; (ii) \nthat the Government is willing and able to make a long-term commitment to MLD capacity \nenhancement; (iii) that relevant agencies follow up on public feedback regarding improving \nservices for disadvantaged populations; (iv) that UNDP will continue to fully support effective \nimplementation  of  the  PPPUE  project;  and  (v)  that  adequate  coordination  exists  across \ngovernment agencies and local bodies. \n \n20.  Risks  that  are  evident  in  the  TA  include  the:  (i)  local  bodies  lack  the  appetite  for \nsubstantive reforms due to existing political conditions at the local level; (ii) communication with \nstakeholders, including local bodies, is inadequate; (iii) LGCDP ownership at MLD may wane; \nand (iv) municipalities may not be properly and adequately engaged with the private sector. \nPrimary mitigating measures for these risks include \n \n(i)  continuing engagement with the Government, MLD, development partners, local \nbodies, and others on TA progress, which is to be undertaken within the context \nof LGCDP implementation, and also independently within this TA; \n(ii)  assistance  for  MLD  in  better  implementing  the  information  and  education \ncampaign activities provided for in the LGCDP;  \n(iii)  active involvement by ADB in the monitoring protocols of UNDP's PPPUE project, \nto the extent provided for by the administrative arrangement; and \n(iv)  bringing all potential issues to the immediate attention of the National Advisory \nCommittee (which also serves as the steering committee for the LGCDP) so that \nthe  Government  and  development  partners  can  jointly  provide  the  needed \nguidance. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $550,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Nepal  for  Support  to  Local  Governance  and  Community  Development \nProgram, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nEffective support for the  Greater availability of  Public perception surveys  End users have adequate \ndevelopment objectives  technical assistance to    scope, tools, and leverage \nof the LGCDP, which  local bodies  Formal and nonformal  to report poor service \nfocus on improved    feedback from local  delivery \nservice delivery by local  Reduced financial  bodies    \nbodies  burden on selected    Nongovernment \n  municipalities  Reports from government  organizations and other \n    agencies as well as  groups monitor and \n  Accurate design and  independent watchdog  impartially bring to light \napplication of  groups  instances of poor service \nenvironmental and social    delivery \nsafeguards  ADB\u2019s project evaluation   \n  missions  Risk \nIncreased willingness of,  Steering committee  Local bodies lack the \nand scope for, women\u2019s  reports  appetite for substantive \ngroups (and others) to    reforms (due to existing \nhold local bodies to  local-level political \naccount regarding  conditions) \nservice delivery \n \nOutcomes      Assumptions \nIncreased capability in  Decrease in processing  Public consultation  Government is willing and \nMLD and local bodies  time for services  feedback   able to make a long-term \n(including municipalities)  provided by local bodies    commitment to MLD \nto implement the    Steering committee  capacity enhancement \nLGCDP effectively  MLD is able to  reports   \nimplement LGCDP    Relevant agencies adhere \nprovisions without  Reports and statements  to public assertions about \nexcessive delays  of government agencies  improving services for \n  ADB review missions  disadvantaged populations \n   \nRisks \nCommunication with \nstakeholders is inadequate \n \nLGCDP ownership at MLD \nmay wane \n \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
