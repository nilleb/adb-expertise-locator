INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB)  Country Strategy and Program (CSP) Update \n(2005\u20132007): India, approved by ADB's Board of Directors on 28 September 2004, included \nsupport for preparing the North Eastern Region Urban Development (Phase II) Project. The \nGovernment of India requested ADB for project preparatory technical assistance (TA)1 to extend \nthe coverage of the earlier initiative of the recently approved project preparatory TA for the \nNorth Eastern Region Urban Development Project in 2004.2 The Government and ADB agreed \nthat project preparatory TA will be provided for the North Eastern Region Urban Development \n(Phase II) Project in 2005. The ensuing loan is scheduled in 2008. The ADB Mission visited the \nNorth  Eastern  (NE)  Region  states3  and  Delhi  during  29  November\u20138  December  2004  to \nundertake fact-finding for the TA. The Mission had discussions with central, state, and local \ngovernment officials as well as elected representatives, and reached an understanding on the \nobjectives,  scope,  cost,  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the  TA.  The  TA  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n2.  The NE Region, comprising the eight states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, \nMeghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and Tripura, is one of the least developed regions in \nIndia. As 98% of its borders lie with other Asian countries, namely, Bhutan and The People\u2019s \nRepublic of China in the north, Myanmar in the east, Bangladesh in the south and west, and \nNepal in the west, the region provides strategically important links to countries of both the South \nAsia Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN). The NE Region is connected to West Bengal and other parts of India through \nthe narrow Siligury Corridor. The region has wide variations in physical features, ranging from \nthe plains of Brahmaputra in Assam to the highly dissected mountains of eastern Himalayas in \nArunachal Pradesh. The region experiences heavy rainfall from April to September and is \nlocated in a sensitive earthquake zone. The Brahmaputra River cuts through Assam with annual \nmenacing floods, brought about by intermittent rains and overflowing rivers in Brahmaputra \nValley, the northern part of Assam, and the Barak Plain, the southern part of Assam, causing \nserious erosion, loss of lives and livestock, heavy damage to infrastructure and property and \nhealth hazards. More than 200 people died in 2004. The Assam earthquakes of 1897 and 1950 \nare among the 10 biggest earthquakes in the world\u2019s recorded history, and the 1950 earthquake \nis one of the most disastrous earthquakes in history; it created heavy landslides that blocked the \ncourse of many hill streams. Scheduled tribes (tribal communities) are predominant in the hill \nstates and constitute about two thirds of the population of the region. As per the Census of India \n2001, the region accounts for 8.0% of India\u2019s area, but has less than 4.4% of its population.  \n \n3.  Of the population of 39 million, 15% or 5.9 million population live in 239 urban centers; \nthe national average is 28% urban. Urbanization over the last two decades has been rapid, with \ncompounded annual growth rates of 4.0% during the 1980s and 2.9% during the 1990s. The \nurban population increased from 2.9 million in 1981 to 5.9 million in 2001 and varies among the \nstates, ranging from 11.1% in Sikkim to 49.5% in Mizoram.4  Except in Assam and Nagaland, \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 7 December 2004. \n2  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to India for the North Eastern Region Urban Development Project. Manila (for \n$1,000,000, approved on 8 June 2004). \n3  A visit to Guwahati and Dibrugarh was undertaken in November 2004, and a previous visit to Itanagar was \nundertaken during the project preparatory TA Fact-Finding Mission of TA 4348-IND (footnote 2) in February 2004, \nwhile a field visit to Imphal will be undertaken during TA implementation in 2006. \n4  The average population density of the NE Region\u2014149 persons per square kilometer\u2014varies from 13 in Arunachal \nPradesh to 340 in Assam, compared with the national average of 324. \n ", "2 \nthe state capitals5 are the largest urban centers with faster urban growth primarily due to \nmigration from infrastructure-deficient rural areas in search of better economic opportunities. \n \n4.  The NE Region has recorded improvements in social indicators over the last decade as \nper the Census of India 2001. While the literacy rates in five states are higher than the national \naverage of 65%, Assam\u2019s literacy rate is slightly lower at 64%. Infant mortality in Assam\u201471 per \n1,000 live births\u2014is higher than the national average of 68 per 1,000 live births; infant mortality \nin other NE Region states is lower than the national average. However, life expectancy at \nbirth\u201456 years\u2014is lower than the national average of 61.6  \n \n5.  Levels of development are low and transport connectivity is very poor due to rough \nterrain and international borders. Law and order problems and ethnic unrest have deterred \npotential  investments  from  outside  the  region.  Throughout  the  region,  basic  infrastructure \nfacilities and services are minimal. Inadequate funding for new infrastructure development and \nlimited  capacities  of  urban  local  bodies  (ULBs)  have  contributed  to  poor  urban  and \nenvironmental conditions. Reflecting the development challenges, the eight NE Region states \nare among India\u2019s special category states (SCSs).7 To transform the Northeast, in May 2004 the \nMinistry of Development of North Eastern Region (MoDNER) was established to replace the \nDepartment of Development of North Eastern Region, an institution established in 2001 as part \nof the Prime Minister\u2019s agenda for the NE Region.  Despite the availability of new central \nGovernment-sponsored funding schemes, such as Non-Lapsable Central Pool of Resources \nand mandatory allocation of 10% of budgetary allocations of various central ministries to the NE \nRegion, fund use has been low.  \n \n6.  The cumulative effect of physiography, poor connectivity, dispersed settlement pattern, \nlow investments, as well as ethnic unrest, has resulted in significant urban poverty. Nearly 32% \nof the population of the region is below the poverty line,8 which is higher than the national \naverage of 26.1%. The proportion of the poor below the poverty line in the urban centers varies \nbetween 8% in Itanagar to 31% in Guwahati, compared with the national average of 23.6%. \nUsing the millennium development goal (MDG) criterion of $1 per capita per day, the incidence \nof urban poverty in the urban centers is high, ranging from 44% in Itanagar to 78% in Guwahati \nand Agartala. In addition, increased migration of the rural poor to the urban areas has resulted \nin uncontrolled expansion of urban slums, especially in state capitals. Inadequate drinking \nwater, lack of sanitary facilities, and poor health exacerbate the harsh living conditions of slum \ndwellers. \n \n7.  Devolution of responsibilities under the 74th Amendment to the Constitution has not yet \nbeen  mainstreamed  in  the  NE  Region  states.  Progress  in  implementing  the  reforms  is \nconstrained by the limited capacities of the states to form urban policies and oversee ULB \noperations. There are only two fully functioning ULBs in Agartala and Guwahati, two partially \nfunctioning ULBs in Kohima and Imphal, and two ULBs without a council in Gangtok and \nShillong. Very significant indigenous tribal populations in five project cities\u2014comprising Aizwal, \nImphal, Itanagar, Kohima, and Shillong\u2014give rise to different institutional arrangements and \n                                                 \n5  Higher growth occurs in Dimapur, the commercial center and where the only airport in Nagaland is located. As per \nthe Census of India 2001, Dispur, the state capital of Assam, is part of Guwahati Municipal Corporation (ward \nnumbers 54 and 55). Population figures are 189,327 for Agartala, 229,714 for Aizwal, 29,162 for Gangtok , 808,021 \nfor Guwahati, 223,691 for Imphal, 34,970 for Itanagar, 78,584 for Kohima, and 132,876 for Shillong.  \n6  The data on life expectancy at birth in Assam\u201356 years\u2013 is the only available data in the NE region states. \n7  There are 11 SCSs in India, which enjoy special budgetary provisions; 30% of central assistance for states plan is \nearmarked for the SCSs. Further, SCSs receive 90% plan assistance as grant, and 10% as loan, compared with \n30/70 for the larger states.  \n8  ADB. 2003. North Eastern Region Urban Sector Profile Project: Final Report. Manila. \n ", "    3 \nlegal systems. In Guwahati and Dibrugarh, urban development authorities have been given \nresponsibility for both land development and development control. Such agencies often crowd \nout the private sector. The local bodies continue to be a weak tier and fully depend on state \ngovernments for leadership. Institutional reform and capacity building are therefore needed to \nsupport the implementation of the provisions of the 74th Amendment to the Constitution in \nstrengthening the functions and responsibilities of ULBs. \n \n8.  Lessons learned from the North Eastern Region Urban Development (Phase I) Project \nare as follows: (i) separate strategies will be developed for the cities of each state due to unique \npolicies, urban institutional frameworks, cultures, and urban histories; (ii) more resources and \ntime are required\u2014due to lack of basic information from which feasibility studies are normally \nprepared\u2014to help the states communicate the project design, policies, and institutional issues \nto the public; and (iii) appropriate travel provision is needed because traveling from one city to \nanother within the region is difficult. Lessons learned from this and other urban projects in India \nwill be incorporated in the project design during TA implementation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will prepare an investment project to help achieve the goal of sustainable urban \ndevelopment and poverty reduction in the NE Region by upgrading urban infrastructure in four \nproject cities (Dibrugarh, Guwahati, Imphal, and Itanagar). The output will be a project feasibility \nstudy for each city. The main consolidated report will be complemented by four city reports. \nThere will be separate technical reports on the key social and environmental safeguard issues \n(e.g.,  resettlement,  need-based  indigenous  people\u2019s  development  plan,  gender  and \ndevelopment, environmental assessments, labor, socioeconomic surveys, etc.) and institutional \nand  capacity  building.  Each  city  report  will  cover,  among  others,  (i)  the  city\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment  strategy,  (ii)  infrastructure  investment  program,  (iii)  urban  management \nimprovement program, and (iv) urban poverty reduction program.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  A participatory approach with extensive stakeholder analysis will be pursued throughout \nTA implementation to elicit the views of a broad range of stakeholders early and incorporate \nthem into the project design. Workshops for stakeholders will be convened in the course of the \nTA. The key TA activities comprise (i) establishment of the main TA office, (ii) extensive surveys \nfor the engineering and socioeconomic profile, and (iii) detailed feasibility studies.  \n \n11.  To prepare a feasibility study for each city, the TA will further expand the findings and \nrecommendations of the North Eastern Region Urban Sector Profile Project (footnote 8). The TA \nwill (i) assess the minimum infrastructure requirement for the project cities to be eligible for \nfinancing; (ii) review past support to the urban sector and lessons learned; (iii) prepare base \nmaps to be used in infrastructure system planning; (iv) map and inventory the existing water \nsupply,  sanitation,  transportation,  and  solid  waste  management  systems;  (v)  conduct  a \nsocioeconomic  survey,  poverty  mapping,  service  demand  survey,  and  willingness-to-pay \nsurveys; (vi) review data collected from the socioeconomic survey, engineering field surveys \naTnhde  vmieawpsp einxgp,r easnsde ds heecroenind aarrey  tshoousrec oef  ftohre  tchoen spurlotajenct ta ncdit iedos  ntoo t ansesceessss atrhiley  rceappreasceitnyt  tthoo cshe aorfg AeD aBn\u2019sd  \npmreempabreer sa, Blteoranrda toivf eD isreucptoprlsy,  Manadn adgeemmeanntd,  omr satnafaf,g aenmd emnat yo bpet ioprnesli mainndar ym ine annastu roef.   service delivery; \n(vii) establish baseline data and identify indicators for monitoring and evaluation; (viii) assess \nurban  poverty  in  project  cities;  (ix)  prepare  long-range  conceptual  plans  for  water  supply, \n ", "4 \nsewerage,  and  solid  waste  management;  (x)  initiate  a  city  development  strategy-based \npackage;  (xi)  based  on  items  (ix)  and  (x),  prepare  an  indicative  integrated  and  prioritized \npackage of urban services and infrastructure investments covering water supply, urban roads, \ntransport, sewerage, drainage, and solid waste management and slum upgrading for the project \ncities; (xii) determine the feasibility of the prioritized investment program based on technical, \neconomic,  financial,  social,  environmental,  and  institutional  considerations  as  the  selection \ncriteria established in the initial stage of the TA; (xiii) prepare an urban poverty reduction \nprogram; (xiv) prepare an urban management reform program; (xv) establish an action plan to \nenhance municipal operations; (xvi) establish an action plan to enhance financial management; \n(xvii)  develop  an  institutional  development  and  capacity-building  program;  (xviii)  prepare  a \ngender action plan; (xix) prepare a need-based development plan for indigenous people; (xx) \nprepare a labor plan; (xxi) prepare an environmental assessment report; (xxii) develop a land \nacquisition and resettlement plan; (xxiii) establish project implementation arrangements; and \n(xxiv) estimate the levels of input for the various consultancies required to plan, survey, design, \nsupervise construction, and monitor quality control for the physical project, as well as for the \nvarious social action and capacity-building programs; and prepare detailed terms of reference \nfor the same.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.2 million equivalent, comprising foreign \nexchange  of  $417,000  and  local  currency  equivalent  of  $783,000.  The  $337,000  foreign \nexchange cost and $463,000 local currency equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom. The $80,000 foreign exchange cost and $80,000 local \ncurrency equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for the Water \nSector. Both grants will be administered by ADB. The Government of India and the state \ngovernments will contribute the remaining local currency of $240,000 equivalent for counterpart \nstaff  support,  office  accommodation,  facilities  for  meetings  and  workshops,  and  other \nadministrative expenses. The Government of India will also provide all information required for \nthe  TA  activities.  The  detailed  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  are  in  Appendix  2.  The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  MoDNER of the Government of India will be the Executing Agency of the TA and will be \nresponsible for overall coordination with ADB. It will also provide full administrative and technical \nsupport to the consultants and will coordinate with all state governments and line agencies in all \nTA activities. State governments and the project cities will provide adequate office space for the \nconsultants, with required support to carry out the task.  \n \n14.  Before fielding the consultants, the Government will establish a TA steering committee, \nchaired by the joint secretary of MoDNER, and consisting of the joint secretary of the Urban \nDevelopment  Department  (UDD),  Ministry  of  Urban  Development  &  Poverty  Alleviation; \nrepresentatives of the Planning Commission and Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) of the \nMinistry of Finance; secretaries of UDD and Public Health and Engineering Department of all \nconcerned states; representatives of the participating cities; and the director of MoDNER as \nmember secretary. Before the TA consultants are fielded, a national-level project director will be \nappointed by MoDNER and a full-time state-level project director by each participating state \ngovernment. MoDNER will arrange three review meetings\u2014at inception, interim stage, and \nbefore the end of the study\u2014for consultants to discuss progress. \n ", "    5 \n15.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  8  months  from  March  to  November  2006.  The \nconsulting  services  will  total  97  person-months\u201413  international  and  84  domestic.    An \ninternational firm in association with a domestic firm will be selected and engaged, using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method with full technical proposal,   in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (January  2005)  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  The  international  consultants  (with \nperson-months in parentheses) will be an urban development specialist as team leader (7), a \nmunicipal finance specialist/financial analyst (3), and a water institutions specialist (3). The \ndomestic consultants are a deputy team leader with expertise in water supply and drainage \nengineering (7); urban governance and institutional development specialist (4); water supply \nand sewerage engineer (5); solid waste engineer (3); flood control and drainage engineer (7); \nenvironmental specialist (6); financial analyst/financial management specialist (4); transport, \nenvironmental, and public sector economists (8); municipal engineers and sector specialists (8); \nurban  transport  engineer  (7);  social  development  and  gender  development  specialist  (5); \nindigenous  people\u2019s  specialist  (3);  resettlement  and  land  acquisition  specialist  (4);  legal \nspecialist  (3);  biodiversity  specialist  (3);  and  public  consultation  and  poverty  assessment \nspecialist (7). The outline terms of reference of the consultants are in Appendix 3. International \nand  domestic  experts  will  be  supported  by  up  to  45  person-months  of  services  from \ntechnical/support staff and 75 person-months from counterpart professional staff. The project \ncities  will  provide  one  counterpart  person  to  work  with  the  consultants  during  TA \nimplementation. The team leader will recruit and engage subprofessional staff as required. The \ninitial poverty and social analysis report is in Appendix 4.  \n \n16.  The TA will provide office equipment such as computers and others that the consultants \nwill purchase in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement (November 2004), and will \nhand over to MoDNER on completion of the TA.  The TA will provide funds for workshops, \nworking  group  studies,  and  surveys  (socioeconomic,  benchmarking,  technical,  etc.)  to  be \nconducted by the consultants in accordance with arrangements acceptable to ADB.  \n  \n17.  The consultants' reports will include (i) an inception report, within 1.5 months of TA \ncommencement; (ii) an interim report, within 4 months of TA commencement; (iii) a draft final \nreport, within 7 months; and (iv) a final report, 3 weeks after receipt from the Government and \nADB of comments on the draft final report. During implementation, the consultants will organize \nthree main workshops to discuss the findings of the inception, interim, and draft final reports, \nand additional workshops in each project city. The interim workshop will include a program for \ngender and development, and indigenous people and development, to discuss the gender and \nneed-based  action  plans  for  the  project.  The  consultants  will  also  organize  participatory \nmeetings in all selected cities throughout TA implementation, to disseminate information on the \nproject and incorporate the feedback from local stakeholders in the project design. All reports \nwill highlight the participatory development activities undertaken during the period. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  (i)  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $800,000  to  the \nGovernment of India to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom \nfor preparing the North Eastern Region Urban Development (Phase II) Project, and (ii) technical \naTshsei svtiaenwcse e xnporte essxecde ehdeirnegin  tahree  ethqousiev aolfe tnhte  ocfo n$s1u6lt0a,n0t0 a0n dto d toh eno Gt noevceersnsmareilny tr eopf rIensdeinat  ttoh obsee  foinf aAnDcBe\u2019sd  \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \non a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector for preparing the North Eastern \nRegion Urban Development (Phase II) Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets  Data Sources/   Assumptions and Risks \nReporting Mechanisms   \nImpact      Assumptions \nSustainable urban  Increased investments in  Periodic assessment  Project design is \ndevelopment in the North  the urban economy   through an agency  implemented effectively. \nEastern (NE) Region by    assigned by Government   \nenhancing level of  Improved urban services to  of India, state  Government and ADB \ninvestments, improving  the poor  governments, and Asian  sign loan agreement. \nlevels of services, making    Development Bank (ADB)   \nurban governance  Regular elections to urban  using defined benchmarks  Risk \neffective, and reducing  local bodies (ULBs)  and evaluation system   Enforcement of the \npoverty      provisions of the 74th \n  Enhanced services  Government statistics and  Amendment to the \n  coverage and levels  reports, reports of bilateral  Constitution in \n  and other external  strengthening the \nEffective complaint  agencies  functions and \nredressal system    responsibilities of ULBs is \n  Loan progress reports  weak. \nFormulation of policies for   \nurban development and  Project  completion  report \npoverty reduction  (PCR) \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nProject design and  Memorandum of  Memorandum of  The Government and \nfeasibility studies agreed  understanding signed by  understanding  local governments and all \nupon by the Government  the Government and ADB    other stakeholders \nand ADB  during loan fact-finding  remain committed. \n  and/or appraisal missions   \n  scheduled for mid-2007   Risk \nThe state governments \ndecide to seek alternative \nfunding. \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Urban and environmental conditions in the region have been \npoor due to lack of adequate investments and weak capacities of urban local bodies.  \n \nThe project will improve urban infrastructure and environmental conditions and related social welfare status in the \nregion by addressing deficiencies in basic infrastructure facilities and services to urban residents in one of the least \ndeveloped regions in India. Direct benefits will be sustained improvements in water supply, roads and urban transport, \nstorm water drains, sewerage, sanitation, and solid waste management in the project cities in the NE Region. The \npoverty impact of the project will be assessed from the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) baseline \nsocioeconomic survey in terms of benefits and costs, which apply to different groups of the population in the project \ncities.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                    Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe poverty estimates in India are done using the head count ratio (HCR) method every 5 years. Though the poverty \ntrends in the country have been controversial, officially, these estimates are used for funding poverty reduction \nprograms (both rural and urban) at the state level.  Following the HCR method, poverty level estimates in the country \nreveal a general decline over the years. Estimates of the Planning Commission of the Government of India indicate \nnearly 17% reduction in urban poverty levels in 17 years (40.8% in 1983 to 23.6%, or a population of about 67 million \nin 2000).  Similarly, the NE Region has achieved remarkable progress in poverty reduction (21.7% in 1983 to 7.5% in \n2000). The national average of the population below the poverty line (1999/2000) is 26.1%, or a population of 268 \nmillion, while the proportion of the poor below poverty line in the project cities varies between 8% in Itanagar to 31% in \nGuwahati. The population of the project cities vary from 0.808 million in Guwahati to only 0.029 million in Gangtok. \n \nHowever, poverty estimates for each of the NE Region states is constrained by lack of data.  In the absence of such \nestimates, the poverty ratios of Assam have been used for the rest of the NE states. To bridge the data gap, poverty \nassessment was carried out using several indicators. The assessments clearly indicate that the dimensions of poverty \nin the region differ from those in the rest of the country. Poverty is linked to incomes and food security.  In the NE \nRegion, poverty is inextricably related to access to services and lack of employment opportunities. Employment \nopportunities lack diversification, as a substantial portion of the population held service jobs in most states in the \nregion.   \n \nHence, poverty level among the NE states shows a distinct diversity.  High literacy rates in urban areas have not \ntranslated into a high level of skills formation in the region, reducing further the scope for occupational diversification.  \nTherefore, the urban poverty reduction strategy in the NE Region has to focus on providing infrastructure and creating \nincome-generating  economic  opportunities.  A  multipronged  approach  is  needed  to  reduce  urban  poverty.  The \napproach will include providing urban basic services and infrastructure, creating employment in diversified sectors, \ndeveloping entrepreneurial skills, establishing facilities for higher credit, and encouraging urban microenterprises.  The \nproposed project will address the majority of the above issues in the urban sector. \n \nNo generalized formula can be applied for estimating urban poverty levels in all states in the region, as intraregional \ndisparities exist.  Further, given the marked differences in the socioeconomic and cultural scenario, the estimation of \npoverty levels in the NE states requires a comprehensive approach. The approach must bring out the specific \nsocioeconomic characteristics and cultural practices that will impact on poverty reduction.  The urban poverty analysis \nmust address key issues of various income groups, social groups, and women. Cross-sectoral assessments are \nrequired to establish interrelationships so that cause-and-effect mechanisms can be understood. An example would \nbe the linkage between urban infrastructure and urban environment, and hence the quality of life.  Thus, technical \nassistance will be required to assess poverty-related data for each of the eight project cities.  \n \nA detailed socioeconomic survey must be conducted in each project city. Urban poverty analysis in the region needs a \nmultipronged and participatory approach to address the various dimensions of poverty, socioeconomic surveys must \nbe accompanied by focus group discussions involving key stakeholder representatives of the society, which will \n ", "  Appendix 4  15 \nfacilitate preparation of municipal action plans for poverty reduction.  Further, a critical review will be made of various \npoverty reduction programs implemented by the state governments and other partners in development.  The results of \nthe discussions will be input to the database analysis, thereby making poverty assessment a qualitative and practical \noutput.  The discussions will form the first stage of a process of participatory implementation of urban projects.  . \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nTo  address  the  various  dimensions  of  poverty,  socioeconomic  surveys  will  be  accompanied  by  focus  group \ndiscussions, involving key stakeholder representatives of the society.   \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nDue to distinct sociocultural characteristics and strategic location (about 98% of the land is bounded by neighboring \ncountries), all the NE Region states are among India\u2019s special category states (SCSs) of the Government of India.  \nThe region has predominant indigenous/tribal populations. A planned participatory approach is needed for information \ngathering. The participatory mechanism will be a two-way process involving on one side information collection and on \nthe other side information dissemination.   \n \nThe TA will use participatory exercises at different levels, viz., community, urban local bodies, line agencies involved \nin providing urban services.  At the community level, discussions using participatory tools like rapid assessment will be \nused in gathering community information and effective decision making to arrive at key strategies.  At the level of local \nbodies and line agencies, workshops and seminars focusing on capacity building will be conducted.  \n \nDiscussion of strategies with the stakeholders who are implementers of the projects will give implementable and \npractical strategies. Participatory meetings with varied groups like nongovernment organizations (NGOs)/community-\nbased organizations (CBOs) will ensure understanding of the key social concerns. Gender workshops and meetings \nwith tribal groups will further ensure that the concerns of the minority and the vulnerable sections of the society are \neffectively addressed. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nGender assessments are very important in this project. Women are the key stakeholders, as improvement in urban \nservices will directly benefit them. Because of the ethnocultural characteristics of the population in the region, women \nplay an important role in society and are very active in matters of societal concern. Gender analysis will be conducted \nto identify the strategies for addressing gender issues. A gender workshop will be conducted to involve the female \nmembers of urban local bodies, and woman community leaders and other agencies to discuss the proposed project \nand how to address gender issues in it. The TA will identify measures to ensure participation of women in pre-design \nand postdesign stages. \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \nA gender action plan and strategy will be developed during TA implementation. \n \nE.
