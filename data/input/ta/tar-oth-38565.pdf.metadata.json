INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Studies carried out by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the late 1990s indicated that \nwomen and other disadvantaged groups face a range of sociocultural and legal constraints to \neffective access to basic social services and productive resources1. In 2001, an ADB-funded \nstudy2 examined the current and potential impact of addressing these constraints through legal \nempowerment (LE), defined as the use of legal services3 and related development activities to \nimprove disadvantaged groups\u2019 exercise of their rights and control over their lives. Qualitative and \nquantitative research yielded preliminary evidence that LE contributes to poverty reduction and \ngood governance. Building on the recommendations of the study and its call for further research, \nthe  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  more  rigorously  test  and  demonstrate  effective \nmodalities of legal services and integrated development activities for women and disadvantaged \ngroups. \n \n2.  The TA will be implemented in three developing member countries (DMCs):4 Bangladesh, \nIndonesia, and Pakistan.5 During TA fact-finding missions in October\u2013November 2004, technical \ndiscussions with governments and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) at central, provincial, \nand district levels confirmed the relevance of the proposed activities under the TA as well as \ngovernments\u2019 commitment to work with ADB in the implementation of the proposed activities.6 \nThe TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy moved from using income levels as chief indicator of \npoverty toward a definition that accentuates equality of rights and opportunity. ADB\u2019s portfolio has \nexpanded to include investments in law and institutional reform, equal access to justice, and the \nestablishment of legal frameworks and institutions for gender equality and poverty reduction. In \nthis context, there has been an increasing recognition that where legal services targeting women \nand other disadvantaged groups are provided in conjunction with ongoing development efforts in \nnatural  resource  management  and  conservation,  rural  development,  land  tenure,  water  and \nirrigation, and health and other areas of socioeconomic development, they create an enabling \nenvironment for community-based organizations, self-help groups, and individuals to successfully \nengage with legal and administrative institutions and to address critical impediments to their \naccess to basic social services and productive resources. For example, learning about and acting \non their legal entitlements helps: poor farmers make use of agrarian reform laws to access private \nor  government-managed  lands  that  would  otherwise  be  illegally  controlled  by  local  elites; \nwomen\u2019s  groups  to  effectively  and  sustainably  manage  water  resources  through  improved \nunderstanding  of  water  rights  and  responsibilities,  government  policy  making,  and  conflict \nresolution  mechanisms;  women  to  assert  their  autonomy  in  personal  reproductive  health \ndecisions, HIV/AIDS prevention, and legal responses to domestic violence, dowry, and underage \nmarriages; upland and coastal communities to manage natural resources in sustainable, poverty-\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n3  Legal services are defined here to include: educational activities (legal information, legal awareness and literacy), \nlegal assistance (legal counseling and representation), paralegal development, alternative dispute resolution and/or \ndialogues with government officials. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 21 October 2004. \n5  Countries were selected based on their diverse approach to legal empowerment, ADB\u2019s current involvement in law \nand judicial reform policy dialogue and investment, and the potential for scaling-up the pilot-tested approach to ADB \noperations. \n6  Concept clearance endorsed by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund at a peer review meeting on 9 July  2004. ", "2    \n   \nreducing ways; and women and other disadvantaged groups to improve their status, access \nsocial  services,  and  interact  cooperatively  and  productively  with  government  agencies  and \nofficials across a broad range of sectors. \n \n4.  Overall, progress in the integration of LE components and/or activities within development \nprograms has been slowed by lack of adequate investment in research and documentation of \nintegrated  approaches  that  combine  the  provision  of  legal  services  for  women  and  other \ndisadvantaged groups with mainstream development efforts undertaken by ADB and other large \ndevelopment partners. To accelerate this process, the following should be considered. \n \n5.  First, it is essential to enhance the understanding of existing public-private partnership \nmodalities in the provision of legal services targeting women and other disadvantaged groups. In \nthe three project countries, identifying and mapping the work of relevant government agencies, \nlegal services NGOs, and development service delivery NGOs (i.e., those that do not specialize \nin the provision of legal services but whose work may include legal rights and entitlements \ndimensions) can help assess the nature, outreach and impact of their LE interventions, existing \npublic-private partnerships, and structural issues which promote or hinder the integration of LE \ncomponents within poverty and sector-specific development projects. \n \n6.  Second,  while  public  legal  services  and  reforms  can  be  effective  means  for  LE, \ncommunity-based organizations, self-help groups and individuals are more likely to benefit where \neffective grassroots intermediary organizations exist. For many years, legal services NGOs in the \nthree project countries have been providing legal services targeting women and disadvantaged \ngroups. However, their limited resources and capacity prevent them from expanding or scaling up \ntheir local successes. Lack of coherent approach to LE is also a constraint. In this context, it is \nincreasingly recognized that a more cost-effective and sustainable approach could be to build \nstrategic  alliance  between  legal  services  and  development  service  delivery  NGOs.  Building \ncapacity of both types of NGOs to work on a coherent approach and standards in the design and \nimplementation of LE components is crucial. This would involve addressing issues such as \ntechnical and financial sustainability, formulating viable options for public-private partnerships in \nthe provision of legal services and establishing effective monitoring and information systems to \nassess the poverty reduction and good governance impact of LE interventions. \n \n7.  Third, there is an urgent need to gather more evidence that legal services combined with \nbasic social services delivery for women and disadvantaged groups can greatly contribute to \npoverty reduction and good governance. Research undertaken in the last few years7 has offered \ncompelling anecdotal examples and basic but promising quantitative evidence of the connection \nbetween  legal  empowerment,  the  economic  and  social  advancement  of  women  and  other \ndisadvantaged groups and good governance. \n \n8.  Fourth, and finally, effective methodologies and institutional arrangements in particular \nsectors need to be established and disseminated among development practitioners in DMCs and \nfunding agencies, including ADB. The limited integration of LE components and activities within \nADB operations reflects a combination of factors, including lack of sufficient follow-up on earlier \nADB  research  that  drew  important  connections  between  LE,  governance  reform,  and  the \nadvancement of the broader poverty reduction agenda. Similarly, there is a need for further \nevaluation and research to identify and document LE modalities, which hold greatest potential for \n                                                 \n7  Research carried out under the auspices of the World Bank, the Ford Foundation and the ADB include: Manning, \nDaniel, 1999.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact of the proposed regional TA will be to promote increased incorporation of LE \ncomponents within ADB loans. Its outcome will be to identify and test effective LE strategies and \nmethodologies to increase access to basic social services and productive resources by women \nand  disadvantaged  groups.9  The  proposed  TA  will  also  help  disseminate  practical  lessons \nlearned for use by ADB staff, governments, NGOs, and funding agencies. It will have four major \noutputs, linked to the sequence of project components described below: (i) situation analyses \nreport, (ii) review of ADB portfolio and its potential for incorporation of LE components, (iii) good \npractices for integrating LE components into ADB operations, and (iv) an operating manual for \nNGOs involved in LE initiatives. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n1.  Component 1: Background Information \n \n10.  This component will collect relevant background information, which will inform the design \nof the pilot LE initiatives to be carried out under component 2. This will involve: (i) situation \nanalyses  reports,  and  (ii) review  of  ADB  portfolio  and  its  potential  for  incorporation  of  LE \ncomponents.  Country-specific  situation  analyses  will  include:  (i) mapping  of  key  government \nagencies, legal services, and development service delivery NGOs involved in LE initiatives;10 \n(ii) description of the legal framework governing the provision of legal services, including relevant \njurisprudence and/or trends in promoting disadvantaged groups\u2019 access to basic social services \nand productive resources; (iii) outline of the legal framework for the operations of NGOs and \ncommunity-based organizations, including how the framework supports or inhibits public-private \npartnerships; and (iv) assessment of LE initiatives in terms of their potential to effectively reach \nlarger numbers of women and disadvantaged groups. Review of ADB portfolio will consist in \nidentifying  opportunities  and  practical  modalities  to  ensure  a  more  effective  and  systematic \nincorporation  of  LE  components  in  mainstream  development  programs  in  the  three  project \ncountries. \n \n2.  Component 2: Pilot Legal Empowerment Initiatives \n \n11.  This component will identify relevant national legal services NGOs and test effective LE \nmodalities to increase women\u2019s and other disadvantaged groups\u2019 access to basic social services \nand productive resources, in one or two districts in each of the three project countries. The pilot \ninitiatives will be conducted in the context of ADB loans with potential to work with local service \n                                                 \n8   Research methodologies should avoid mechanical benchmarking and be designed to elicit findings and results that \nmay not be anticipated in the research design. \n9   For the purpose of this TA, disadvantaged is defined to include the poor, as well as those who face discrimination \nand/or  abuse  as  a  result  of  their  gender,  race,  ethnic  identity  or  other  personal  attributes.  Poverty  and \ndiscrimination  of  this  kind  undercut  disadvantaged  groups\u2019  ability  to  access  basic  social  services  (health, \neducation, water/sanitation and justice) and productive resources. \n10   This will include: bar councils and associations, associations of women jurists, women\u2019s rights NGOs and \nnetworks, legal services NGOs, community-based organizations and development service delivery NGOs involved \nin LE for women and disadvantaged groups. \n ", "4    \n   \ndelivery  NGOs.11  Pilot  LE  initiatives  may  include:  educational  activities  (legal  information, \nawareness,  and  literacy),  legal  assistance  (legal  counseling  and  representation),  paralegal \ndevelopment, and alternative dispute resolution and/or dialogues with government officials. Legal \nservices NGOs will be selected to carry out pilot activities in collaboration with locally based \nservice delivery NGOs, local government agencies, and the communities (see selection criteria in \nAppendix 4), while in other cases capable local legal services organizations may undertake the \nwork  directly.  The  effectiveness  of  pilot  LE  initiatives  will  be  measured  based  on  cost-\neffectiveness (i.e., estimated cost of LE initiatives/number of beneficiaries reached and/or cases \nsolved) and impact on target groups. The impact of pilot LE initiatives will be assessed through \nsample surveys and focus groups discussions, using control groups to allow comparison between \nthe areas with LE initiatives and those without. The indicators to assess impact will include: \ngeneral knowledge and application of the law; access to productive resources and/or social \nservices  provided  by  the  loans;  engagement  and  confidence  in  citizen  advocacy;  positive \nperception of gender equity and the role of women in governance; and confidence in the value of \nlaw and good governance. The information and understanding drawn from the LE pilot initiatives \nwill yield valuable lessons and best practice for use in the design and implementation of ADB \nloans. The pilot phase will continue for 12 months, including a participatory preparation phase \nwhich will identify the exact types of LE services and detailed implementation arrangements. \n \n3.  Component 3: Dissemination and Follow-Up \n \n12.  This component will assess impact and lessons learned flowing from components 1 and 2, \nso as to suggest further steps for the ADB, DMCs, and NGOs in the three project countries. \nFindings and sector-specific lessons learned from the pilot LE initiatives targeting women and \ndisadvantaged groups will be presented in: (i) good practices for integrating LE components into \nADB operations, outlining modalities to be utilized in the design, implementation, and impact \nassessment of LE initiatives within sector-specific operations; and (ii) an operating manual for \nNGOs involved in LE initiatives, outlining options and practical modalities to ensure technical and \nfinancial sustainability of LE initiatives, public-private partnerships, greater impact of LE initiatives, \nand establishment of effective monitoring and information systems. TA results and findings will be \ndiscussed at national workshops in the three project countries; and at a regional conference at \nADB headquarters. National workshops will aim to present findings and seek feedback from \nadvisory  working  groups  and  government  focal  agencies,  civil  society,  and  funding  agency \nrepresentatives to identify potential ways to scale up the LE approach from local to provincial \nand/or national levels, and to promote public-private LE partnerships in sectors relevant for ADB \noperations. The regional conference will present findings and lessons learned and plan any \nfollow-up activities that could ensue from the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $550,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund  in  the  amount  of  $550,000  and \nadministered by ADB. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n11 ADB loans will be selected by the international NGO\u2014in close consultation with the Gender, Social Development \nand Civil Society Division, the Office of the General Counsel and the regional departments\u2014among primary health \ncare and/or water and sanitation (Bangladesh); rule of law and governance (Pakistan) and rural/urban development \n(Indonesia). \n ", "5\n   \n D.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  18  months,  commencing  in  November  2005  with \ncompletion  date  expected  in  April  2007.  Consultants\u2019  inputs  will  amount  to:  12  months  for \ninternational consultants, 18 months for national consultants, and 12 months for each legal \nservices NGO selected to carry out LE initiatives in the three project countries. An international \nNGO will be engaged under the quality- and cost-based selection method as a firm to undertake \nthe consulting services under this project, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  satisfactory  procedures  for  engagement  of  national  consultants.  Simplified \ntechnical proposals will be required from the short-listed NGOs. The implementation team fielded \nby  the  international  NGO  will  be  composed  of:  international  experts  (team  leader,  field \ncoordinator, and research coordinator), national experts (sociolegal and research specialists), \nand  subcontracted  national  legal  services  NGOs.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \ninternational/national  experts  and  national  legal  services  NGOs  are  in  Appendix  3.  The \ninternational NGO will select and subcontract designated legal services NGOs in each project \ncountry to carry out the LE pilot initiatives under component 2, applying the selection criteria set \nforth in Appendix 4, on terms and conditions to be approved pre-fact by ADB. \n \n15.  The Gender, Social Development and Civil Society Division (RSGS) will be the Executing \nAgency  of  the  TA,  responsible  for  overall  management  and  monitoring  of  TA  activities,  in \ncollaboration with the Office of the General Counsel. Pilot testing of LE initiatives in selected \ndistricts where ADB projects are being implemented will be facilitated by the field coordinator, in \nconsultation with regional departments and resident missions concerned. The advisory working \ngroup will provide guidance to the implementation team in the design of the TA-funded activities, \nbe informed on progress in carrying out the research and LE initiatives, provide insights into \nrelevant government policies and ways of integrating LE into DMCs\u2019 national poverty reduction \nstrategies and ADB loans, and contribute to discuss follow-up initiatives. It will serve advisory \nfunctions on voluntary bases and include representatives from governments\u2019 focal agencies, legal \nservices  NGOs,  collaborating  development  service  delivery  NGOs  and  TA  consultants. \nGovernments\u2019 focal agencies for this TA have been identified based on their current and/or \npotential involvement in facilitating pro-poor LE initiatives and include: the National Legal Aid \nServices Organization (Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs), Bangladesh; the Law \nand Justice Commission of Pakistan; and the Directorate General of Human Rights Protection \n(Ministry of Justice and Human Rights) in Indonesia. Governments\u2019 focal agencies in each DMC \nwill be responsible for ensuring inclusion and participation of representatives from ministries of \nwomen\u2019s affairs, relevant sector ministries and government agencies responsible for national \npoverty reduction strategy processes in the advisory working group. \n \n16.  The reporting requirements for the international NGO  are as follows: (i) an inception \nreport, including a detailed work plan, within 4 weeks of TA commencement; (ii) individual country \nsemiannual  progress  reports;  (iii) a  draft  final  report,  at  least  1  month  before  the  regional \nconference at ADB headquarters; and (iv) a final report summarizing the outputs with appropriate \ndocumentation of achievements. \n \nIV.
