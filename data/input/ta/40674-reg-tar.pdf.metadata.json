INTRODUCTION \n1.  Regional cooperation and integration (RCI) is identified as a priority in the medium-term \nstrategy II of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which is trying to mainstream RCI in its \noperational strategy and programs, with capacity development and institutional strengthening as \na cross-cutting theme. This approach has been supported by the ministers of participating \ncountries in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Economic Cooperation Program1 and the \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program.2\n \n2.  As active participants in various RCI initiatives, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nand  Mongolia  have  approached  ADB  for  assistance  in  capacity  development.  During \ndiscussions on the country partnership strategy (CPS) 2008\u20132010 for the PRC and country \nprogramming, the Government of the PRC asked ADB to provide technical assistance (TA) for \ncapacity building for regional cooperation. At a joint meeting with ADB in Manila in March 2007, \nsenior representatives of the governments of the PRC and Mongolia highlighted the importance \nof  capacity  development  for  effective  regional  cooperation,  and  jointly  requested  ADB\u2019s \nassistance. This regional technical assistance (RETA) is a response to these requests and aims \nto build capacity and strengthen institutions in the two countries with a view to support their \nparticipation in various regional cooperation programs, including the one on PRC-Mongolia \ncooperation.3 The RETA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Rapid  transition  from  command  to  market-based  economies  in  both  the  PRC  and \nMongolia has resulted in a reduction of barriers to the cross-border movement of goods, capital, \nand people, with a view to expanding markets, realizing economies of scale, and promoting \neconomic complementarities. In both countries, regional cooperation is increasingly assuming a \nmore strategic role in national development agendas, with ADB being seen as a valuable \npartner in such cooperation. \n \n4.  Regional cooperation is a prominent theme in the CPS for the PRC. The Government \nattaches great importance to regional cooperation as a means of addressing many cross-border \nissues,  fostering  friendship  and  economic  ties  with  neighboring  countries,  and  enhancing \nregional stability and growth. The PRC has been an active participant in various RCI initiatives, \nincluding ASEAN+3,4 the Boao Forum for Asia, the Pan-Beibu Gulf Economic Cooperation \nForum,5 the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the CAREC, GMS, and PRC-Mongolia \ncooperation  programs,  all  three  of  which  are  coordinated  by  ADB.  In  addition  to  central \n                                                 \n1  The joint ministerial statement of the 14th Ministerial Meeting of the GMS Program held on 21 June 2007 in Manila \nnoted \u201cthe enhanced emphasis on support for human resource development,\u201d including building capacity and \nenhancing skills for a core group of officials in developing member countries with responsibilities for regional \ncooperation affairs. \n2   The Comprehensive Action Plan of the CAREC Program endorsed by the 5th Ministerial Conference on 20 \nOctober 2006 in Urumqi, the People\u2019s Republic of China highlighted knowledge and capacity building as one of the \nfour strategic pillars of the CAREC program. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 23 November 2007.  \n4  The 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nJapan, and the Republic of Korea.  \n5  Begun in 2006, the Pan-Beibu Gulf Economic Cooperation Forum focuses on promoting cooperation in the Pan-\nBeibu Gulf subregion, which covers Brunei Darussalam, the southern coastal provinces of PRC, Indonesia, \nMalaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Viet Nam. Co-sponsored by the PRC Government and ADB, the 2006 and \n2007 forums brought together key government decision makers from the countries and business leaders across \nthe subregion to discuss issues related to subregional cooperation. Promoting trade and investment and building \ninfrastructure connectivity were identified as initial priorities. \n ", "2       \ngovernment agencies, a number of provinces and autonomous regions are active in regional \ncooperation. These include Yunnan province and Guangxi Autonomous Region in the GMS \nprogram, and Xinjiang Autonomous Region and Inner-Mongolia Autonomous Region in the \nCAREC and the PRC-Mongolia cooperation programs.  \n \n5.  The Country Strategy and Program Update (2007\u20132009) for Mongolia treats regional \ncooperation as a priority. Mongolia is a landlocked country, whose economy is narrowly based \non agriculture and mining.  Regional cooperation is especially significant and offers Mongolia an \nopportunity to strengthen physical and economic links with its neighbors and realize its growth \npotential.  Mongolia joined the CAREC program in 2001, and has also been actively involved in \nregional cooperation in northeast Asia, including PRC-Mongolia cooperation and the UN-led \nGreater Tumen Initiative.  \n \n6.  Both the PRC and Mongolia strongly endorse the need to strengthen their participation \nin regional cooperation initiatives, yet both face institutional and human resources constraints. \nWith ADB\u2019s support, national focal points and/or national secretariats for regional cooperation \nhave been set up in both countries, based in the ministries of finance. These need to be \nstrengthened,  and  consultation  and  coordination  on  regional  cooperation  among  central \ngovernment agencies improved. Government staff directly engaged in regional cooperation \nneed training to initiate, design and implement complex projects and programs with regional \ndimensions. Training is particularly needed in the governments of the border provinces of the \ntwo countries where many of the regional cooperation projects are implemented. There is a \nstrong  need  in  the  two  countries  to  formulate  forward-looking  and  action-oriented  national \nand/or provincial strategies to guide their participation in RCI programs.  The PRC Government \nhas asked ADB to support Yunnan province to formulate a strategy for its participation in the \nGMS Program. The members of the Pan-Beibu Gulf Economic Cooperation Forum (footnote 5) \nhave  asked  ADB  to  help  establish  an  international  expert  group.  Both  the  PRC  and  the \nMongolian governments have asked ADB to support the PRC-Mongolia cooperation program.6  \n \n7.  In  the  GMS  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy  and  Program  Update  and  the  CAREC \nComprehensive Action Plan,7 capacity building and institutional strengthening is a cross-cutting \ntheme. In recent years, ADB, under the framework of GMS and CAREC, has provided technical \nassistance  to  strengthen  the  capacity  for  regional  cooperation 8   particularly  through  the \nestablishment of senior officials\u2019 meetings, ministerial conferences, national focal points, and \nnational secretariats. The design of this RETA has taken into account lessons learned from this \nearlier TA and the GMS Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management (PPP): (i) national \nand provincial capacity building and institutional strengthening efforts need to be deepened in \norder to increase country ownership; (ii) since the Ministry of Finance acts as the national \ncoordinator for regional cooperation, its capacity needs to be matched by that in other ministries \nand agencies and in provincial governments; (iii) to use resources more effectively and avoid \nduplication,  further  coordination  and  rationalization  is  needed  between  ADB-led  regional \ncooperation  programs  and  other  RCI  initiatives;  (iv)  national  and  provincial  strategies  are \n                                                 \n6  ADB is supporting PRC-Mongolia cooperation activities under a separate RETA: ADB. 2006.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The intended impact is to strengthen the institutional and human capacity for regional \ncooperation of the governments of the PRC and Mongolia.  \n \n9.  The envisaged outcome is more effective functioning of national focal points and/or \nnational  secretariats  in  the  PRC  and  Mongolia,  particularly  with  regard  to  policy  planning, \ncoordination, and strategic management of regional cooperation programs.  \n \n10.  The impact and outcome of the RETA will be achieved through the delivery of the \nfollowing outputs: \n \n(i)  stronger coordination of regional initiatives at the country level in both the PRC \nand Mongolia;  \n(ii)  strategies  for  regional  cooperation  programs,  including  the  PRC  Yunnan \nprovince\u2019s strategy toward the GMS and Mongolia\u2019s national strategy for regional \ncooperation; \n(iii)  studies on deepening regional cooperation in selected sectors;  \n(iv)  regional  cooperation  policy  and  project  proposals  developed  through \nconsultations and workshops;  \n(v)  training of a core group of the PRC and Mongolian senior and mid-level officials \nresponsible for regional cooperation programs; and \n(vi)  establishment  of  an  international  expert  group  for  Pan-Beibu  Gulf  Economic \nCooperation Forum. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  RETA  was  formulated  through  a  consultative  process  involving  extensive \ndiscussions  between  ADB  and  the  two  governments.  A  participatory  approach  to  project \nimplementation will be adopted to foster strong country ownership. All components of the RETA \nwill be implemented in close consultation with the ministries of finance in the two countries. This \nwill also provide learning-by-doing opportunities for government counterpart staff.  \n \n12.  The RETA will undertake the following activities: \n(i)  organizing in-country consultation and sector workshops to coordinate policies \nand programs for regional cooperation among central government agencies and \nbetween central government and provincial governments;  \n(ii)  formulating the PRC Yunnan Province\u2019s strategy toward the GMS and Mongolia\u2019s \nnational strategy for regional cooperation;  \n(iii)  conducting studies of selected sector(s) in the PRC and Mongolia to develop \npolicy and project proposals for regional cooperation;9  \n                                                 \n9  Sector(s) will be identified through consultations with the governments of the PRC and Mongolia. Based on initial \nfeedback from the governments, potential sectors include energy (focusing on cross-border energy trade) and \ntransport (focusing on development of cross-border corridors). \n ", "4       \n(iv)  training  a  core  group  of  senior  and  mid-level  officials  from  the  central  and \nprovincial governments of the PRC and Mongolia to enhance their negotiating \nskills and to design and implement regional cooperation projects and programs \n(as far as possible,  such training will build on and contribute to the capacity \ndevelopment activities of the PPP and the CAREC Institute);10 \n(v)  supporting the establishment and the initial operation of the international expert \ngroup under the Pan-Beibu Gulf Economic Cooperation Program; and \n(vi)  promoting information and experience sharing between the PRC and Mongolia \nwith regard to regional cooperation.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $900,000  equivalent,  of  which  $750,000 \nequivalent will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The governments of \nthe  PRC  and  Mongolia  will  contribute  about  $150,000  equivalent  in  total  by  providing \ncounterpart  staff,  office  space,  support  for  training,  seminars  and  conferences,  and  other \nadministrative and logistical services. Details of the TA cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  A  total  of  12  person-months  of  international  and  36  person-months  of  national \nconsultants will be required to provide advisory and technical services under the RETA. The \nconsultants will help to develop regional cooperation strategies for Mongolia and the PRC\u2019s \nYunnan Province; institute or improve a process to coordinate regional cooperation activities at \nthe  country  level  and  to  conduct  training;  work  with  national  focal  points  and  national \nsecretariats to coordinate regional cooperation; and conduct studies on regional cooperation in \npriority sector(s) to be identified at a later stage in consultation with the governments of the PRC \nand Mongolia. The RETA will also engage international and national resource persons to help \norganize and make presentations to in-country policy consultations, sector workshops, and \ntargeted training events. Consultants and resource persons will be selected and engaged by \nADB  as  individuals  based  on  their  qualifications  and  experience  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof reference for consultants and resource persons are in Appendix 3. Office equipment will be \nprocured by the implementing agencies in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement \n(2007, as amended from time to time), and will be transferred to implementing agencies upon \ncompletion of the RETA. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from January 2008 to December 2009. \nADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  Country  Coordination,  Regional  Cooperation, \nGovernance, Finance and Trade Division of the East Asia Department will administer and \nimplement  the  RETA.  The  ministries  of  finance  of  the  PRC  and  Mongolia  will  be  the \nimplementing  agencies,  supported  by  ADB\u2019s  resident  missions  in  the  two  countries.    The \nimplementing agencies will coordinate with various government agencies and help to (i) set the \nagendas of workshops and training events, (ii) determine the sectors to be covered by studies \non deepening regional cooperation, and (iii) select national consultants and resource speakers. \nADB  will  facilitate  communication  between  the  two  governments.  Monitoring  of  the \n                                                 \n10  The Executing Agency will coordinate closely with the secretariat of the PPP and the ADB CAREC Unit to identify \nopportunities for the PRC and Mongolian officials to also benefit from courses under the PPP and the CAREC \nInstitute. The course(s) developed under this RETA will also be shared with PPP and the CAREC Institute. \n ", "    5\nimplementation progress and TA outcomes will be carried out through periodic reviews of the \nTA activities as per the design and monitoring framework.  \n \n16.  The East Asia Department will coordinate closely with other ADB departments, including \nthe Southeast Asia Department for matters related to the GMS, the Central and West Asia \nDepartment and the CAREC Unit for matters related to the CAREC, the Office of Regional \nEconomic Integration for trade and finance-related activities, and the Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department for work on regional public goods. It will also seek partnerships with \nother regional cooperation bodies. \n \n17.  The RETA outputs, particularly the findings and recommendations from the national and \nprovincial  strategies  and  selected  sector  studies,  will  be  disseminated  through  workshops, \nseminars,  conferences,  publication,  and  the  media.  Where  appropriate,  representatives  of \nneighboring countries and the secretariats of other regional cooperation bodies will be invited to \ndissemination events.  \n \nIV.
