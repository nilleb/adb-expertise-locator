The technical assistance is needed to determine the feasibility of quickly improving the \nroad subject to the budget and time available, and the socio economic and environmental \nbenefits of the project. The road condition is very poor and is sparsely used at present (about 4 \nvehicles per day in some parts). Most parts will require complete reconstruction. Background \ninformation and technical and social data needed to make this determination with a high level of \ncertainty are scarce. They have to be either collected or obtained from archived records, and \ncarefully examined to avoid the significant errors in estimated costs and construction times in \npast and on-going projects. This assistance will, therefore, provide a platform for developing a \ngeographic information system to compile and use data for project preparation, road design, \nconstruction, maintenance and operation. It will be the first instance that technology will be used \nin  the  road  subsector  in  Georgia  for  managing  social  and  environmental  issues  that  are \ncontinuing to delay road projects. Additionally, the best operation and maintenance mechanisms \nmust  be  included  in  the  project  design  to  ensure  sustainability  of  the  investment. \nThe  government  will  soon  procure  maintenance  of  selected  secondary  roads  under  a \nperformance-based contract as an experiment. This TA will enable the government to determine \nthe  most  suitable  method  of  sourcing  maintenance  works  for  the  project  based  on  this \nexperiment\u2019s results and other on-going activities. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The project will have three main outputs: \n \n(i)  Improved road from Dzirula to Chumateleti, about 50 km in length; \n(ii)  Improved access to the railway stations adjacent to the improved road; and \n(iii)  Geographic information system. \n \n3.

Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n4.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.2 million equivalent, of which $1.0 million equivalent will \nbe  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V). \nThe government will provide counterpart support values at $200,000 in the form of counterpart \nstaff, office space for consultants, and other in-kind contributions.

The PPTA will be implemented over eight months starting in November 2013 and ending \nin July 2014. ADB will select an international consulting firm that will, in partnership with a \nnational firm, mobilize a team of specialists to determine the socio economic and environmental \nbenefits and the technical feasibility of improving the road with the given budget. An individual \ninternational consultant will be recruited for the external review of TA consultant\u2019s outputs. \nSelection will be made according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time) using the quality and cost-based selection criteria (90:10 ratio). \nThe  firms  will  be  required  to  provide  services  of  international  and  national  consultants \namounting to 22 and 28 person months respectively. The international consultants will study: \n(i)  economics  and  finance;  (ii)  highway,  structural  and  geotechnical  engineering  and \nmaintenance; (iii) social development and resettlement; (iv) environment, while the national \nconsultants  will  provide  services  in  (i)  computer  aided  design;  (ii)  geographic  information \nsystems; (iii) hydrology; and (iv) geodetics.  \n \nTable A4.3: Summary of Consulting Services Requirement \nPositions  Person-Months Required \nInternational   \nTransport economist (Team Leader)  8 \nHighway design engineer  5 \nMaintenance engineer  1 \nGeotechnical engineer  2 \nStructural engineer  2 \nSocial development and resettlement specialist  2 \nEnvironment specialist  2 \nNational   \nGeodetic engineer (Deputy Team Leader)  8 \nComputer aided design specialist  6 \nGeographic information systems specialist  6 \nSocial development and resettlement specialist  4 \nEnvironmental hydrologist  4 \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n6.

Transport and Communication Division of CWRD will be responsible for administering \nthe  consulting  services  contract.  The  executing  agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Regional \nDevelopment  and  Infrastructure.  It  will  appoint  staff  from  the  Roads  Department,  the \nimplementation unit for ADB\u2019s on-going project, to work with the consultants and provide short \nweekly updates to ADB and the government, and flag any delays, disputes, and difficulties in \nadvance.  \n \n8.  ADB project officer will be responsible for monitoring the consulting firm\u2019s work, advising \nthe team, communicating with the government, and convening and facilitating tripartite meetings \nwhile seeking innovative and sustainable designs. To independently confirm the quality and \nvalidity of the findings, as well as the innovativeness of the consultants\u2019 recommendations, the \ndraft final report will be reviewed by an external reviewer and a member of ADB\u2019s Transport ", "Community of Practice, in addition to the project team. The team leader of the consultants will \nbe responsible for the delivery of the all PPTA outputs and report to the Director, CWTC, \nthrough ADB project officer overseeing implementation of this TA. All communications will be \ncopied to the RD. \n \n9.  All  disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended). \n \n10.
