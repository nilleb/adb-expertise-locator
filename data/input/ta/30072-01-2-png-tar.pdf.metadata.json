INTRODUCTION\n1. Following a request made to the Bank by the Government of Papua New\nGuinea (PNG) to provide advisory technical assistance (TA) for the Industrial Centres\nDevelopment Corporation (ICDC), a Bank Fact-finding Mission visited PNG from 23 to 26 April\n1996. The Mission held discussions with the National Planning Office, the Commercial\nInvestments Division of the Department of Finance, the Commerce Division of the Department\nof Commerce and Industry, and the management and staff of ICDC. The Mission confirmed\nthe need for the TA and reached an understanding with the Government on the scope, cost\nestimates, financing plan, terms of reference, and implementation arrangements.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The overall socioeconomic performance of PNG has been problematic over the\nlast decade. Per capita income is around $1,000 a year, placing it among middle-income\ncountries. But life expectancy, infant mortality, and literacy rates are poor, reflecting the\nweakness of public service delivery in the face of substantial hurdles of geography and\nlanguage. Real gross domestic product (GDP) varies significantly from year to year,\ndepending largely on the performance of the mining and, recently, the petroleum sectors. In\n1993, GDP increased by 17 percent, while in 1994 it grew by only 3 percent and in 1995 it\nactually declined by about 4 percent, mostly because of necessary corrective measures\nintroduced in the Government's structural adjustment program but also because of reduced\noutputs of minerals and petroleum.\n3. Economic growth has been mostly related to activity in the large-scale mining\nand petroleum sectors. The economy is highly dualistic, a modern minerals sector coexisting\nwith a traditional subsistence sector on which four fifths of the population still depend. Inability\nto generate sufficient investment in the nonmining sector is a fundamental and longstanding\neconomic problem. The Government has not succeeded in deploying its mining revenues to\nachieve broad-based economic development, and PNG has yet to develop substantial\nindigenous pools of skilled labor or of entrepreneurs with knowhow and capital. The high and\ngrowing level of unemployment is a critical concern. There is a potential labor force of about 2\nmillion, but there are only about 220,000 jobs in the formal sector. The labor force is growing\nby about 55,000 persons a year, but fewer than 10,000 jobs are being created. Despite high\nunemployment, wage costs are high. This problem, land acquisition difficulties, poor workforce\nskills, and inadequate infrastructure together present enduring constraints to the development\nof the private sector. Private investment, 14 percent of GDP in 1981, was less than 8 percent\nin 1994. Persistent high unemployment, especially in towns, and low levels of formal\neconomic activity contribute to a significant problem of law and order.\n4. The industrial sector is still in its infancy; most needs for manufactured goods\nare met by imports. The Government's 1991 Medium-Term Industry and Trade Development\nAction Plan (the Action Plan) recognizes the role that industry can play in economic\ndevelopment, and sets out a program for promoting industrial activity and so broadening the\ninvolvement in the economy of national and foreign entrepreneurs. The industrial sector offers\npotential for employment creation, both through import substitution and export promotion,\nwhich would be more evenly distributed throughout the nation than employment in mining. A\nsignificant component of the plan is the development of appropriate infrastructure to improve\nThis TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in April 1996.", "2\nproductive capacity. It is important to encourage local and foreign investment in manufacturing\nactivities. In 1992, a Bank-funded study1 reviewed the Action Plan and the Government's\nindustrial sector policies. It suggested a strategy for implementing the plan, and endorsed the\nGovernment provision of industrial estates.\n5. Among moves to foster industrial and commercial activity, the Government has\nestablished a series of commercial statutory authorities aimed at promoting national and\nforeign entrepreneurship and private sector development. ICDC was created in 1990 (under\nthe ICDC Act), specifically to promote industrial activities by developing and managing\nindustrial estates. With land in PNG owned communally, entrepreneurs have difficulty finding\nland for industrial development, negotiating access to it, and then developing it; land disputes\nare common. The Government, through ICDC, can help overcome these problems. ICDC can\nbe a major catalyst for industrial development by providing industrial estates and promoting\nindustrial and commercial activity generally. Given adverse publicity about PNG and general\ninternational ignorance of its potential for industrial development, the latter role is particularly\nsignificant.\n6. With the assistance of a Bank2 loan, ICDC's first industrial estate was\ndeveloped near Lae, Morobe Province. Project construction began in July 1990 and the\nMalahang Industrial Centre (MIC) was officially opened in September 1993. Commercial\noperations started in 1994, when the first tenancy agreement was signed. The loan was\nclosed in July 1995, and the Project completion report was circulated to the Board in\nDecember 1995. It concluded that the Project had been successfully executed but noted that\nfacilities were underutilized. Since then, with a gradually increasing number of tenants,\nrevenues have been rising and are expected to exceed operating costs by the end of 1996.\nBy that time it is projected that nearly one third of the facilities will be leased with annualized\nrevenue of approximately $300,000. MIC's annual operating expenses are approximately\n$160,000.\n7. Consistent with its mandate to promote industrial activities, the ICDC corporate\nplan calls for an industrial center in each of PNG's four regions by the year 2000. MIC, the\nfirst industrial center, serves the Momase Region and is the base for industrial growth in\nMadang, Morobe, and Sepik provinces. Industrial centers are also planned for the Islands,\nHighlands, and Southern Regions. The Southern Region Industrial Centre in Port Moresby\nwas to have been the second major project in the program. However, development priorities\nchanged in September 1994 when volcanic eruptions engulfed Rabaul and destroyed much\nof the local industrial and commercial infrastructure. The establishment of the Islands Region\nIndustrial Centre (lRlC) has become an urgent priority for its development impact and as a\ncomponent of the Government's program to restore services to the area affected by the\ndisaster. Land has been acquired and demand assessed for IRIC. The Bank has been\nrequested to help prepare and finance IRIC, as the second industrial center, and the project is\nincluded in Bank's forward lending program.\n8. ICDC is a wholly-owned statutory authority of the Government. It is intended\neventually to be declared a \"commercial statutory authority,\" operating on a commercial basis,\n1\t\nTA No. 1580-PNG: Review of IndustrialAssistance Policy, for $400,000, approved on 17 October 1991.\n2\t\nLoan No. 1 024-PNG(SF): Industrial Center Development Project, for $8,400,000, approved on 9 August\n1990.\nPCR: PNG 22281: Industrial Center Development Project, December 1995.", "1\ncharging for its services at market rates and paying taxes and dividends. Once fully\noperational, the approved head office organization structure provides for a staff of 34 in four\ndivisions headed by the Managing Director. The four divisions are Human Resources, Project\nPlanning and Development, Finance and Administration, and Operations. Each of the four\nregional industrial centers is to be staffed by six people headed by a regional manager\nreporting to the Operations Manager. With the development of industrial centers in all four\nregions, the ICDC's staff complement will grow to 58. Currently, with a partial head office\nestablishment and only one industrial center in operation, it has 25 staff. At this level, annual\noperating expenses are approximately $700,000.\n9. ICDC is a young organization. Although it has benefited from financial and\ntechnical support under an initial loan from the Bank, ICDC requires substantial further\nsupport to strengthen its institutional capabilities, especially in development planning, financial\nanalysis, and marketing. A particular need is to upgrade capability in appraising and\ndeveloping industrial sites, a critical consideration now that the establishment of IRIC has\nbecome so urgent.\nIll. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n10. Within the broad aim of creating sustainable employment, the TA will foster\nindustrial development by building up ICDC's capacity in planning, managing, and marketing\nindustrial estates.\nB.\t Scope\n11.\t The TA will strengthen ICDC's institutional capabilities, particularly in\ndevelopment planning, financial analysis, and marketing. The Project Planning and\nDevelopment Division, responsible for ICDC's development program and having a key role in\nthe development of IRIC, will be strengthened. Assistance in development planning will help\nsee this project to fruition and train the staff for planning and preparing subsequent projects.\nThe Finance and Administration Division is responsible for producing and interpreting timely,\naccurate financial information for use by ICDC management. Assistance in financial analysis\nwill help formulate strategies for achieving the financial objectives of ICDC's corporate and\nbusiness plans. Staff will be trained to interpret financial information and use financial models\nfor sensitivity analysis. Areas of assistance will include budgeting, corporate planning,\nfinancial planning, and project appraisal. The Operations Division is responsible, not only for\nday-to-day operations of regional industrial centers, but also for the marketing of facilities to\nensure full occupancy and commercial viability. Assistance in marketing will be used to\ndesign a program to attract tenants and train staff in marketing operations. Detailed terms of\nreference for each consultant are set out in Appendix 1.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n12. The total cost is estimated at $710,000 equivalent, of which $585,000 is in\nforeign exchange and $125,000 equivalent in local currency. The foreign exchange cost will\nbe incurred for consultant remuneration and international travel. The local currency\ncomponent will meet the cost of local travel and transportation, office accommodation,", "4\nadministrative support, equipment, communications, training workshops and conferences, and\ncounterpart staff remuneration. The entire foreign cost component of $585,000, and $15,000\nequivalent of the local cost, will be financed by the Bank on a grant basis, and the remainder\nof the local cost component, amounting to $110,000 equivalent, will be financed by ICDC from\nits own resources. The Government has been informed that the provision of the TA by the\nBank does not commit it to extend further financial or technical assistance in this regard.\nDetailed cost estimates are provided in Appendix 2.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n13. The TA will be carried out by individual consultants selected in accordance with\nthe Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Consultants will be recruited in the areas of\ndevelopment planning, financial analysis and training, and marketing. Each consultant will\nhave extensve experience and expertise in the field, as well as Pacific experience. The TA\nwill require 27 person-months of international consulting services. The TA will be carried out\nover a period of 12 months and is expected to be completed in September 1997.\n14. The Executing Agency will be ICDC, which will be responsible for overseeing\nthe work of the consultants and will provide counterpart staff to assist them.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n15.
