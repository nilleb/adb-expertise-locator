During the 2003 Country Programming Mission, the Government of the Philippines (the \nGovernment) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  to provide technical assistance \n(TA) to prepare the Intermodal Transport Development Project for southern Philippines as part \nof  the  2004  nonlending  program.  During  the  Fact-Finding  Mission  in  October  2003,  ADB \nreached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, terms of reference for \nconsulting services, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements of the \nTA.1 Appendix 1 gives the preliminary project framework.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \nA.  General \n2.  Transport in the Philippines is essentially multimodal, a journey through the archipelago \nusually  combining  air,  sea,  and  road  transport.  Intermodal  transport  systems  and  their \nconnections to the hinterland play a crucial role in the economic development of the widely \ndispersed regions of the country, and provide a lifeline access for remote areas with high \npoverty incidence. Improving the intermodal transport system is consistent with the development \npolicies/strategies  for  the  transportation  sector  as  enunciated  in  the  current  Medium-Term \nPhilippine Development Plan (MTPDP). The ADB-assisted Philippine Transport Strategy Study \ncompleted in 1997 provided inputs for the transport sector aspects of the MTPDP. The study    \n(i) concluded that the most interesting possibilities in multimodal/intermodal routes are the road-\nsea  routes  among  the  country's  islands  utilizing  both  fast-craft  and  RORO  ferries,                     \n(ii) emphasized that improving road links that facilitate efficient intermodal transport in the region \nshould be given high priority in the road program, (iii) suggested ways in which the Government \ncan help the private sector provide intermodal transport system, and (iv) explored modalities to \ndevelop local air/sea routes to improve access to small islands. \n \n3.  Major constraints to increased regional investment and development include inadequate \ninfrastructure  facilities  and  lack  of  reliable,  safe,  and  efficient  transport  services,  which \nsignificantly hamper the movement of passengers and cargo, and consequently limit direct \ninternal  and  external  trade  links  as  well  as  tourism.  While  the  above  constraints  may  be \nobserved  throughout  the  country,  they  particularly  contribute  to  and  exacerbate  retarded \ndevelopment and poverty in  southern Philippines. Within the southern Philippines, Mindanao \nand Palawan islands are considered priority areas for development. It was therefore agreed with \nthe Government that the TA will focus on these areas, which will also provide a more balanced \nregional  development,  and  support  ADB\u2019s  commitment to the development of the Brunei, \nIndonesia,  Malaysia,  and  Philippines  East  ASEAN  Growth  Area  (BIMP-EAGA).  The \nGovernment is also preparing a Mindanao investment plan that is still being finalized, to identify \npriority programs and projects in Mindanao in all sectors, including infrastructure, but which \ndoes not specifically address intermodal transport issues. \n \nB.   Water Transport \n \n4.  The port network in the study area includes 14 primary and secondary ports under the \nPhilippines Ports Authority (PPA), as well as hundreds of tertiary ports \u2014 also known as feeder \nor municipal ports \u2013 which are under the responsibility of the Department of Transportation and \nCommunications  (DOTC),  local  government  units  (LGUs),  Autonomous  Region  of  Muslim \nMindanao (ARMM), or  private sector. Some provinces have many feeder ports: Surigao del \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 26 May 2003. ", "2 \nNorte (169), Palawan (65), Sulu (55), and Zamboanga del Sur (54). PPA's mandate  is to \nmanage public ports, which are not devolved to LGUs. Other port operators are Fisheries \nDevelopment Ports Authority and Philippine Veterans Development Corporation (PHIVEDEC), \nresponsible for fishery ports and Mindanao Container Terminal in Cagayan de Oro, respectively. \nProject management office-Ports (PMO-Ports) of DOTC is responsible for the construction of \nfeeder ports, which are basically nonrevenue ports to be transferred to LGUs for operation after \nconstruction. Inland ports and water transport, such as on Lanao Lake, also are significant. A \nmajor issue in ports development is the inadequate funding sources, leading to limited port \nfacilities particularly for container and roll on-roll off (RORO) operations.  Lack of maintenance \nfor feeder ports and insufficient enforcement of safety regulations on passenger ships are other \nmajor subsector issues. \n \n5.  Between 1995 and 2000, sea passenger traffic in the Philippines grew steadily from 44.3 \nmillion to 56.6 million, or about 5% annually, while cargo traffic grew from 150 million to 170.5 \nmillion tons, or about 2.5% annually. Passenger traffic and domestic cargo traffic in the study \narea account for about 40% and 29%, respectively, of the total maritime traffic in the Philippines.  \n \nC.  Air Transport  \n6.  Air transport is also a vital mean of transportation in the  study area, not only to link \ndifferent  islands  but  also  to  develop  linkages  with  neighboring  countries,  such  as  Brunei \nDarussalam, Indonesia, and Malaysia. Air traffic is mainly attributable to tourism, industry, and \nbusiness. The study area has 24 airports. The airports are maintained and managed by the Air \nTransportation Office (ATO), but expansion or new projects are undertaken by DOTC. At \npresent, most of the airline network provide links between Manila and Cebu as hubs with \nseveral major spoke airports, such as Davao, Cagayan de Oro, General Santos, Zamboanga, \nand Puerto Princesa. Limited intra-Mindanao regular air services, associated with severe peace \nand order problems faced by land transport on some of the main routes, create a high cost and \nlong travel time for intraisland trips. The Government also realized that civil aviation plays an \nessential role in the development of international tourism in the Philippines. The Department of \nTourism (DOT) has, therefore, outlined its strategy to improve access \u2014 especially by air, and \nother infrastructure \u2014 to key tourist destinations. In the study area, Davao has been identified \nas one out of five tourism gateways in the Philippines. \n \n7.  The air traffic in the study area in 2002 was about 2.3 million, or approximately 11% of \nthe total air traffic in the country. The economic crisis in 1997 resulted in the decrease in the \ntotal passenger traffic from about 22.5 million in 1997 to 19.4 million in 1998. The traffic level in \n2002 (20 million) was still below the level in 1997.  Air traffic in southern Philippines has also \ndeclined sharply due to the economic crisis and safety issues for travel in the area. Only a few \nairports, like those in Davao, Cagayan de Oro, and Zamboanga, have recorded a slight increase \nin air traffic during 1998\u20132002. \n \nD.  Road Transport \n8.  Road infrastructure plays an important role in intraisland movement. However, road \ndensity in Mindanao and Palawan is estimated at 0.3 kilometer (km)/km2, which is less than half \nthe average road density in the Philippines (0.67 km/km2).  National arterial roads managed by \nthe Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) provide the main trunk line system \nconnecting major population centers and linking regions, whereas national secondary roads \nprovide linkages among provincial centers within the regions. Provincial roads provide the \nconnections within provinces, interconnecting municipalities and linking them to national roads \nand public wharfs, railway stations, and ports. Since these roads are about 75% of the total road ", "  3 \nlength, it is essential that provincial governments and LGUs integrate their plans with the \nnational Government\u2019s road master plan. \n \nE.  Common Issues \n9.  Transport subsectors face common issues and need to: (i) develop an intermodal \nplanning approach to integrate the subsector development plans and improve connection of \ninter- and intra-island transport systems; (ii) develop an appropriate pricing policy to recover \ncosts of commercial operations; (iii) improve the efficiency of operations and management;     \n(iv) establish a clear policy for the Government, its attached agencies, local government, and \nprivate sector to finance the development of commercial and noncommercial infrastructure and \nfacilities; (v) promote private sector participation (PSP) by improving the existing legal and \nregulatory framework for PSP and providing appropriate incentive schemes for the private \nsector; (vi) establish a sustainable mechanism for operating and maintaining noncommercial \ninfrastructure, as well as related transport services, so as to improve access and level of service \nin remote areas; (vii) improve safety through a regulatory and enforcement system, including \npolicies for renewing ageing fleets; (viii) provide adequate road maintenance; and (ix) promote \nefficient transport services in all modes to increase mobility and improve accessibility. \n \nF.  External Assistance \n10.  For maritime transport, the major source of external assistance is the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC), which is financing construction and rehabilitation of fishing \nports, feeder ports, and the PHIVEDEC Mindanao Container Terminal. Future JBIC assistance \nwill include the RORO Ferry Network Development Project, which is part of the Trans-Visayas \nintermodal transport network system. The United States Agency for International Cooperation \nfunded  the  Growth  with  Equity  in  Mindanao,  a  Mindanao  Economic  Development  Council \n(MEDCO) program to provide capital assistance to ARMM for medium-scale infrastructure, \nincluding roads and ports. The World Bank is also funding small port projects in ARMM. In the \npast, ADB had financed port projects in the Philippines including fishery ports, Cotabato Port \nand Manila Port, and a project preparatory TA on feeder ports in the late 1980s, which did not \nrecommend further investment in this sector at that time. \n \n11.  For air transport, ATO is developing its air navigation facilities through the Nationwide Air \nNavigation Facilities Modernization Project funded by JBIC, completed in 2003. JBIC will also \nprovide funds to modernize communication navigation surveillance/air traffic management to \nensure more effective traffic management in Manila air space, subsequent to provision of an \nAeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network and Airport Information System under ADB \nfinancing. ADB and the European Investment Bank (EIB) have jointly funded the upgrading of \nDavao Airport into an international airport. The Third Airport Development Project also financed \nby ADB and EIB, intended to upgrade six airports (Puerto Princesa, Cotabato, Sanga-Sanga, \nDipolog, Butuan, and Pagadian), was partially cancelled due to delay in project preparation. \nADB and EIB agreed with the Government to re-appraise the six airport projects, and consider \nfinancing those that are still economically viable and ready for implementation. \n \n12.  These interventions in the maritime and air transport sectors have met some of the \ninfrastructure  needs  in  southern  Philippines.  However,  they  were  not  part  of  a  coherent \napproach  to  prioritize  infrastructure  development  and  facilitate  access  to  the  southern \nPhilippines. The Strong Republic Nautical Highway Project (SRNHP) was designed by the \nGovernment in September 2002, as the first attempt to address the need for linking more \ndeveloped areas of the country with less developed areas in southern Philippines. However, the \nSRNHP focuses on equipment and logistics to improve intraisland road and ferry connections ", "4 \nand develop ferry routes. It does not address the need for priority port and airport infrastructure \ndevelopment to promote interisland transport. The TA will complement the SRNHP by providing \nan  intermodal  transport  development  strategy  and  prioritizing  interisland  infrastructure \ndevelopment, which could be financed by ADB. The TA and the expected ensuing project \nsupport the Country Strategy and Program Update (CSPU) 2004-2006 for the Philippines. The \nCSPU assigns high priority to improving access to remote areas of the southern Philippines and \nenhancing the efficiency of the intermodal transport system, by reducing deficiencies in land, air, \nand sea transport systems and improving network interconnections. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.   The TA will help the Government formulate an intermodal transport development project \nthat will improve access to southern Philippines and contribute to reduce poverty in this area by \n(i) preparing an integrated transport development plan for Mindanao and Palawan that will \nidentify key priorities to improve the efficiency of the intermodal (air, sea, and land) transport \nsystem,2 (ii) formulating recommendations on priority areas for ADB intervention and a program \nof subprojects suitable for an ensuing ADB-financed project, and (iii) supporting the preparation \nof the selected subprojects. The summary initial poverty and social analysis is at Appendix 2.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.   The TA will be conducted in two phases. Following an integrated transport system \napproach and building on the recommendations of the planning studies for the various transport \nsubsectors, phase 1 will (i) identify the priority interventions (capital investment, policy reform, \nand institutional strengthening) to improve the complementary road-port-airport network and \nrelated  transport  services  in  Mindanao  and  Palawan;  and  (ii)  identify  suitable  areas  of \nintervention for ADB, select candidate subprojects from a shortlist of projects based on priorities \nof intervention, and recommend an investment program for preparation in phase 2. During a \ntripartite  meeting  at  the  end  of  phase  1  to  review  the  consultants\u2019  findings  and \nrecommendations, the Government and ADB jointly will confirm the focus of phase 2 and agree \non a list of candidate subprojects and the principles guiding the corresponding implementation \nand financing arrangements. In view of the type and status of preparation of the selected \nsubprojects, the Government and ADB will jointly decide whether a project or a sector loan \napproach will be followed in phase 2, and the scope and terms of reference of phase 2 will be \nfinalized accordingly. \n \n15.  Phase 2 (project preparation) will then (i) carry out feasibility studies of the subprojects \nselected during phase 1, including technical, economic, and financial appraisal, and assessment \nof environmental, social, and poverty impacts; and (ii) finalize the project scope, implementation \nand financing arrangements, required capacity building measures, and supporting policy and \ninstitutional reform agenda addressing governance and developmental impact issues. Outline \nterms of reference for consulting services for phases 1 and 2 are in Appendix 3. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n16.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.426 million equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange component of $647,000 and a local cost component equivalent to $779,000. ADB will \nprovide $1.0 million to finance the total foreign exchange cost and a portion of the local currency \n                                                 \n2   In particular, the Government already indicated its priority for feeder ports development. ", "  5 \ncost of $353,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Philippine Government will provide the \nremaining $426,000 equivalent in kind in the form of office accommodation, counterpart staff, \nand data/surveys/studies related to the TA. A detailed cost estimate is in Appendix 4.  The \nGovernment was advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing \nproject. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.   The TA will require a total of about 61 person-months of consulting services: about 24 \ninternational and 37 domestic. The international consultants will have expertise in (i) transport \nplanning and economics, (ii) air transport, (iii) maritime transport, (iv) financial analysis and \npublic-private  partnership,  (v)  institutional  development,  (vi)  social  development  and \nresettlement, and (vii) environment. An international consulting firm in association with domestic \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, \nusing  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging domestic consultants.  \n \n18.   DOTC will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A counterpart team led by the Transport \nPlanning Service of DOTC assisted by PMO-Ports will be established to coordinate TA activities \nand work daily with the consultants. To promote transfer of knowledge to the staff, DOTC will \nprovide full-time counterpart staff that will work with the consultants in an integrated team. \n \n19.   A steering committee comprising DOTC, DOT, National Economic and Development \nAuthority (NEDA), Department of Finance, DOTC attached agencies,  DPWH, Department of \nInterior  and  Local  Governments,  MEDCO,  and  ARMM  will  be  established  to  oversee  TA \nimplementation. An integrated transport plan will be submitted to the  Inter Agency Committee \nfor  Transport  Planning  chaired  by  NEDA.  Local  stakeholders,  including  local  government, \nnongovernment organizations, private sector and civil society, will be involved through national \nworkshops  and  regional  consultations.  Local  governments  participating  in  the  Project  as \nsubproject implementing agencies, if any, will be also represented in the steering committee \nduring  phase  2.  DOTC  will  provide  the  consultants  with  office  accommodation  and \ncommunications facilities and ensure that all data and information relevant to the TA are \navailable to the consultants when needed. Office equipment for the project management office \nwill be procured by the consultants under their contract in accordance with arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB, and will be transferred to DOTC upon completion of the TA.  \n \n20.  The consultants will be fielded in November 2004 and will carry out their work over 11 \nmonths ending in September 2005. They will submit their inception, interim (2), and draft final \nreports before the end of months 1, 4, 7, and 10, respectively. Tripartite meetings involving the \nGovernment, ADB, and the consultants will discuss the findings of these four reports. \n \nIV.   THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n21.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Philippines for preparing the Intermodal Transport Development Project, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.

Country Poverty Reduction Partnership \nAgreement?   \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Philippines. By targeting isolated areas with high poverty \nincidence and including not only improvement but also development of transport infrastructure such as small ports and \nairports or sea/air landing facilities, the Project will link remote communities to provincial centers/markets and foster both \neconomic growth and poverty reduction in the targeted areas. Moreover, as one of its components focuses on transport \nservices, the Project has potential to address transport users needs, and thus to target direct poverty reduction \nobjectives.  During technical assistance (TA) implementation, the pursuit of this objective in various directions will be \nstudied:  establishment of mechanisms fostering lower transport prices; development of initiatives favoring private sector \ntransport services and increased competition; improvement of transport logistics, cargo/storage space distribution, and \nschedules so as to fit the needs of the poorer transport users; or provision of small infrastructure or services that may \nimprove the trading potential of the poor and improve their access to transport.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? Poverty analysis will be an integral part of subproject selection/design and \nwill be based on quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Subproject selection will include the combined analysis of \nsector poverty data with country, region, and subproject level poverty data and will involve field-based poverty \nassessments/stakeholder consultation. Subproject planning/design will entail comprehensive social analysis to identify \nthe type of intervention that may directly benefit the poor. \nPoverty Classification (final classification will depend on TA and loan processing findings)      Other  \n \nC.

Project selection will entail organizing consultation workshops at national and regional levels, \ninvolving all major stakeholders \u2014transport providers, transport users, and concerned nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs)  with  interest  in  intermodal  transport  issues.  Once  the  subprojects  are  selected,  consultation  with  local \nstakeholders will be at the core of subproject design and implementation. Participation and consultation mechanisms will \nhave particular intensity in defining intervention under the transport services component. For small-scale subprojects \ntargeting specific communities, project planning and implementation may be carried out through community-driven design \nmechanisms directly involving the beneficiary communities and NGOs.  \nParticipation strategy required                                                                                                           Yes \n \nD.
