An \nenvironmental  assessment  review  procedure  and  subproject \nenvironmental selection guidelines have been formulated to guide \nthe implementation of future subprojects.  \n   \nProject Description  The Second Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement \n(Sector) Project (the Project) supports the improvement of urban \ngovernance  and  of  infrastructure  and  service  delivery  in \npourashavas  (secondary  towns).  The  Project  adopts  the \nperformance-based allocation of investment funds as an incentive \nmechanism  for  governance  reform.  Performance  criteria  are \ndefined  in  six  key  areas  of  urban  governance:  (i)  citizen \nawareness  and  participation,  (ii)  urban  planning,  (iii)  women\u2019s \nparticipation,  (iv)  integration  of  the  urban  poor,  (v)  financial \naccountability  and  sustainability,  and  (vi)  administrative \ntransparency.  Investment  funds  will  be  utilized  to  improve \nmunicipal  transport,  drainage,  solid  waste  management,  water \nsupply, sanitation, municipal facilities, and basic services in slums. \nThe project design is based on the lessons from the ongoing \nUrban  Governance  and  Infrastructure  Improvement  (Sector) \nProject (UGIIP-1).  \n   \nRationale  Unplanned and rapid urbanization creates large unmet demand \nfor  urban  infrastructure  and  services.  Pourashavas  have  not \nmanaged to meet this challenge because of weak governance, \nlimited  financial  and  human  resources,  and  a  lack  of  proper \nplanning.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  supported \nurban development with a series of projects. The most important \nlesson,  in  particular  from  the  ongoing  UGIIP-1,  is  that  the \nimprovement of urban infrastructure and service delivery can be \nachieved more effectively by linking it with governance reforms \nand creating a proper incentive mechanism. The performance-\nbased allocation of investment funds creates a strong incentive for \npourashavas  to  reform  their  governance,  and  the  improved \ngovernance ensures the effectiveness and sustainability of the \ncapital investments. ", "ii     \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project is sustained improvement in the urban \nenvironment  and  quality  of  life  in  target  pourashavas.  The \noutcome  of  the  Project  is  improved  urban  governance  and \nexpanded access to urban infrastructure and services in target \npourashavas.    \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $167.5 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $10.7 million.   \n   \nFinancing Plan  ADB  will  provide  SDR  55,445,000  ($87  million  equivalent), \ncovering  51.9%  of  the  project  cost.  German  development \nassistance will cofinance the Project with \u20ac3 million ($4.7 million \nequivalent) from GTZ and \u20ac23 million ($36.1 million equivalent) \nfrom  KfW.  The  Government  of  Bangladesh  will  finance  the \nequivalent of $31.7 million, covering 18.9% of the project cost. \nPourashavas  will  finance  the  equivalent  of  $7.3  million  and \nbeneficiaries $0.7 million.   \n \nAmount  Share  \nSource  ($ million)    (%) \nAsian Development Bank (ADF)  87.0    51.9 \nGTZ  4.7    2.8 \nKfW  36.1    21.6 \nGovernment of Bangladesh  31.7    18.9 \nPourashavas  7.3    4.4 \nBeneficiaries   0.7    0.4 \n  Total    167.5    100.0 \nADF  =  Asian  Development  Fund,  GTZ  =  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit, KfW = Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau. \nSources: Government of Bangladesh and Asian Development Bank estimates.    \n \nThe ADB loan from Special Funds resources will have a 32-year \nterm, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge \nof 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  For subprojects that generate cash revenues, 50% of project cost \nTerms  for class A pourashavas and 30% of project cost for Class B \npourashavas will be relent with an amortization period of 20 years, \nincluding a 5-year grace period and an interest charge of 4% per \nannum. The remaining project costs will be funded as a grant. For \nsubprojects that do not generate cash revenues, 100% of the \nproject cost will be funded as a grant. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  June 2015 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2014 \nCompletion Date \n   ", "    i i i  \nImplementation  A project management office will be established within the Local \nArrangements  Government Engineering Department (LGED) and responsible for \noverall project management. In each target pourashava, a project \nimplementation unit will be established.   \n   \nExecuting Agency  Local Government Engineering Department \n   \nProcurement  Procurement  of  goods  and  services  under  the  Project  will  be \ncarried out in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time), and the Government\u2019s \nPublic Procurement Rules (2008), as acceptable to ADB. National \ncompetitive  bidding  procedures  will  be  applied  for  works \ncontracted for less than $2.0 million and will be the major mode \nfor civil works contracts, as the subprojects are small. Equipment \nand  materials  will  be  procured  under  international  competitive \nbidding  when  the  estimated  cost  is  more  than  $500,000 \nequivalent.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  support  project \nimplementation  and  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  the \npourashavas  and  LGED.  Major  packages  are  package  1: \ngovernance  improvement  and  capacity  development,  and \npackage 2: management, design, and supervision. Consultants \nwill  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time), and the Government\u2019s Public Procurement Rules \n(2008), as acceptable to ADB. The firms will be selected using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method. \n   \nProject  Benefits  and  An estimated 3.8 million citizens of the target pourashavas will \nBeneficiaries  benefit  from  improved  governance,  infrastructure,  and  service \ndelivery. Citizens, in particular women and the poor, will have \nenhanced  representation  in  urban  management.  The  poor  in \nslums will directly benefit from the provision of basic services in \nslums selected in each pourashavas.    \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  A major assumption of the Project is that the performance-based \nallocation of investment funds will generate sufficient incentive for \npourashavas to carry out governance reforms. Also assumed is \nthat citizens are willing to participate in decision making, and that \nelected leaders and pourashava officials will listen and respond to \ncitizens\u2019 voices. The successful experience of UGIIP-1 indicates \nthat  the  performance-based  allocation  mechanism  creates \nsufficiently strong incentives for governance improvement. It is \nunlikely that pourashavas will find significant alternative funding \nsources,  which  could  undermine  the  leverage  of  performance-\nbased  allocation.  Further,  enhanced  citizen  participation  is \nassumed to establish sustainable incentives for elected leaders to \nimprove urban management and services.   \n ", "", "89o  00'E 91o  45'E\nBANGLADESH\nSECOND URBAN GOVERNANCE AND\nINFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT\n(SECTOR) PROJECT\nThakurgaon\nKurigram\nN\nRangpur\n25 o 30'N Dinajpur Teesta R. 0 25 50 75 25 o 30'N\nI N D I A Gaibandha\nKilometers\nR A J S H A H I Sunamganj\nNachol Jamuna R.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Second Urban Governance and Infrastructure \nImprovement  (Sector)  Project  (the  Project).  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n   \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Urbanization. Bangladesh has experienced increased urbanization since independence \nin 1972. An estimated 38 million people lived in urban areas, or 27% of the total population, in \n2005.1 Though this level of urbanization is still relatively low, population growth in urban areas \nhas been high at 6% per annum since independence, compared with total population growth at \n2% per annum.2 With existing growth rates, the country\u2019s urban population will double by 2035 \nto reach 74 million, or 40% of the total population.3 The contribution of urban areas to the \nnational gross domestic product grew from 26% in 1973 to 42% in 1999. Rapid urbanization has \ncreated growing demand for urban infrastructure and services.  \n \n3.  Urban Infrastructure and Services. The development of urban infrastructure has not \nkept pace with rapid urbanization, causing an acute shortage in every urban service. Piped \nwater is available in only one third of pourashavas (secondary towns), typically only for 2\u20134 \nhours per day.4 Water quality is poor in many pourashavas, with high iron content or arsenic \ncontamination. No urban areas have sewerage, with the exception of a very limited system in \nDhaka. An estimated 40% of households resort to open defecation or use unsanitary hanging \nlatrines.5 Only 20% of solid waste is collected, and households dump their solid waste directly \ninto streets, public spaces, and drains. Drainage is underdeveloped and poorly maintained. \nDuring monsoon rains, roads and pathways become flooded, causing severe traffic congestion \nand risks to public health. As roads and bridges have insufficient capacity to meet growing traffic \nvolume, traffic jams in city centers limit access to economic opportunities and social services.  \n \n4.  Urban Poverty. Despite significant progress, a large portion of the urban population still \nlives below the poverty line. Bangladesh achieved a significant reduction in the national poverty \nrate, which fell from 59% in 1991 to 42% in 2005 (footnote 3). The poverty rate in urban areas \ndeclined from 45% to 37% in the 1990s.6 Economic opportunities in urban areas attract large \nnumbers of migrants from rural areas. New migrants, as well as second-generation migrants, \ntend  to  live  in  slum  areas  without  decent  housing  or  basic  services.  Inequality  among \nhouseholds is acute in urban areas, with the rich in central business districts and the poor in \nurban slums. \n \n5.  Urban Governance. Urban governance is weak and lacks effective citizen participation, \naccountability, or financial management. Pourashavas are governed by an elected mayor and \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2006.

The mayor tends to dominate decision making on every aspect of pourashava \nmanagement, with little responsiveness and accountability to the public. Citizens, in particular \nthe poor and women, do not have effective avenues to influence decision making. Pourashavas \ndo not have the capacity to generate sufficient revenues and depend on budgetary transfers \nfrom the central Government of Bangladesh (the Government), which account for more than half \nof the total revenues for most pourashavas. The collection efficiency of local taxes is very low. \nBetween 2000 and 2002, only 29% of smaller pourashavas collected more than half of their \nestimated holding tax, which is their most important own revenue source.7 Human resources are \nlimited, with many untrained staff and vacant approved posts.  \n \n6.  Urban Planning. Most pourashavas do not have a plan for land use or developing \ninfrastructure. This, combined with weak governance, means that investments tend to be made \nin an unplanned and discretionary manner. Class A pourashavas have an urban planner in the \napproved organizational chart, but the position is often long vacant.8 The lack of proper urban \nplanning leads to the inefficient allocation of available funds, further stressing limited resources.   \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  Key Issues. Unplanned and rapid urbanization creates large unmet demand for urban \ninfrastructure and services. Pourashavas have not managed to meet this challenge because of \nweak governance, limited financial and human resources, and a lack of proper planning, which \nare interlinked. Under the weak governance structure, elected leaders and pourashava officials \nlack incentives to respond to citizens\u2019 needs and demands. Pourashavas do not generate \nsufficient financial resources for investment or staffing, and they do not have strong incentives \nto improve. Without an urban planner, no proper urban planning is carried out, which causes the \ninefficient use of the limited resources available. \n \n8.  Well-planned urbanization can significantly reduce poverty. The National Strategy for \nAccelerated  Poverty  Reduction9 emphasizes  that  urbanization  has  so  far  been  a  factor \ncontributing to poverty reduction, and that urban poverty and growing disparities within urban \nareas is an important policy issue. According to the strategy, effective poverty reduction is \nclosely linked to effective urbanization strategies. Furthermore, good governance is recognized \nas a critical factor encouraging economic growth and poverty reduction. The strategy includes \npublic  administration  reforms,  anti-corruption  measures,  decentralization,  and  strengthening \naccountability and participation. The detailed urban sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n9.  Experiences and Lessons. The strategic thrust of assistance of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for the urban sector in Bangladesh has been poverty reduction through shared \ngrowth, social development, and good governance. ADB has been a leading agency in urban \ndevelopment and has supported a series of projects. The most important lessons, in particular \nfrom the ongoing Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project (UGIIP-1), \nindicate that the improvement of urban infrastructure and service delivery can be achieved more \neffectively by linking it with governance reforms and creating a proper incentive mechanism. \nThe following are the specific lessons: \n                                                 \n7  World Bank. 2007.

", "     3   \n(i)  The performance-based allocation of investment funds is a mechanism proven \neffective at creating incentives for pourashavas to improve their governance and \nmanagement. \n(ii)  Citizens\u2019 participation in urban governance improves the responsiveness and \naccountability of elected leaders and pourashava officials. \n(iii)  Proper urban planning is essential for the efficient use of available resources. \n(iv)  Pourashavas\u2019  financial  sustainability  can  be  substantially  improved  through \neffective tax collection.   \n \n10.  These lessons have been reflected in the design of the Project. In particular, the Project \nwill continue the performance-based allocation of investment funds with defined performance \ncriteria for governance improvement. The performance criteria emphasize citizen participation, \nurban  planning,  and  financial  management  as  key  areas  for  improvement.  Past  external \nassistance to urban areas is listed Appendix 3, and a summary of lessons from the UGIIP-1 is in \nAppendix 4.  \n \n11.  National Reforms. Support for urban development in Bangladesh presents a significant \nopportunity at this time. In addition to the ongoing local governance reforms supported by the \nUGIIP-1, the Government recently initiated a set of national reforms. The Government approved \nthe  new  Pourashava  Ordinance  (2008),  City  Corporations  Ordinance  (2008),  and  Local \nGovernment Commission Ordinance in May 2008. The new Pourashava Ordinance (2008) \nreplaces  the  old  Pourashava  Ordinance  (1977)  and  strengthens  citizen  participation  and \naccountability  in  pourashavas.  The  Local  Government  Commission  is  the  country\u2019s  first \npermanent institution dedicated to policy guidance for local governments. \n \n12.  ADB has supported the national reforms. The new Pourashava Ordinance is one of the \nrecommendations made by the committee for urban local government, which was supported by \ntechnical assistance funded by ADB.10 The recommendations were based on the experiences in \ngovernance reform under the UGIIP-1. For example, each pourashava formed committees with \nrepresentation of broad citizen groups under the UGIIP-1, namely the town-level coordination \ncommittee (TLCC) and ward-level coordination committees (WLCCs). The TLCC and WLCCs \nare forums to discuss various issues in the pourashava and ensure the participation of diverse \nsocial strata in decision making. Recognizing the effectiveness of TLCCs and WLCCs, the \nGovernment made committees with citizen representatives a statutory requirement under the \nnew Pourashava Ordinance (2008), and they have been utilized in other projects.11 \n \n13.  Further, nationwide institutional frameworks are emerging for urban development. The \nLocal Government Engineering Department (LGED), which traditionally supports infrastructure \ndevelopment in rural areas, is strengthening its urban management wing with a newly created \npost  of  additional  chief  engineer  to  manage  projects  in  urban  areas.  Under  the  urban \nmanagement wing, the Urban Management Support Unit (UMSU) was created by consolidating \ncapacity development programs supported by various projects.12 The municipal performance \n                                                 \n10 The technical assistance for Supporting Urban Governance Reform, approved on 28 November 2002, is attached \nto ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President on a Proposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) \nProject. Manila. The studies carried out under the technical assistance focused on the national urban sector policy, \nthe holding tax system, financial management, and the amendment of the Pourashava Ordinance (1977).   \n11  One example is the Urban Partnerships for Poverty Reduction Project funded by the United Nations Development \nProgramme and the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom. \n12 UMSU originally provided assistance in pourashavas under ADB financing. UMSU is merging with the Municipal \nSupport Unit financed by the World Bank, which provides similar capacity development.   \n ", "4     \nreview  committee  (MPRC)  was  established  to  review  and  monitor  the  performance  of  all \npourashavas supported by different projects.13 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of the Project is sustained improvement in the urban environment and quality \nof life. The outcome of the Project is improved urban governance and expanded access to \ninfrastructure and services in target pourashavas.14    \n \nB.  Outputs \n15.  The  Project  consists  of  three  components:  (i)  A:  urban  infrastructure  and  service \ndelivery, (ii) B: urban governance improvement and capacity development, and (iii) C: project \nmanagement and implementation support.   \n \n1.  Component A: Urban Infrastructure and Service Delivery \n16.  The output of component A is developed infrastructure and improved service delivery, \nincluding municipal transport, drainage, solid waste management, water supply, sanitation, and \nmunicipal facilities. The criteria for subproject selection are in Appendix 5. The subprojects in \neach  pourashava  will  be  identified  through  participatory  urban  planning.  The  amount  of \ninvestment funds allocated to each pourashava depends on the progress of its governance \nreforms.  \n \n17.  Municipal  Transport.  Subprojects  in  municipal  transport  aim  to  reduce  traffic \ncongestion and improve access to economic opportunities and social services. Investments \ninclude the (i) repair, rehabilitation, and expansion of pourashava roads, traffic junctions, and \nfoot paths; (ii) rehabilitation and expansion of bridges and culverts; (iii) development of riverboat \nlanding stations; (iv) procurement of equipment for routine maintenance; and (v) procurement of \nequipment for traffic management and road safety.    \n \n18.  Drainage. Subprojects for drainage aim to mitigate water stoppages and inundation to \nimprove the urban environment and protect public health. Investments include the (i) repair, \nrehabilitation, and expansion of the existing drains; (ii) construction of new drains; and (iii) \nprocurement of equipment for maintenance.    \n \n19.  Solid Waste Management. Subprojects in solid waste management aim to introduce or \nimprove  systems  to  collect,  segregate,  and  dispose  of  solid  waste  for  a  clean  urban \nenvironment and protecting public health. Funds  will be utilized for the (i) procurement of \ncollection and storage equipment; (ii) construction of storage, treatment, and sanitary disposal \nfacilities;  and  (iii)  support  of  community-based  organizations  (CBOs)  doing  house-to-house \nrefuse collection. The Project will examine the potential of subprojects\u2019 registering with the \nClean Development Mechanism. \n                                                 \n13 The pourashava performance review committee, which was utilized under UGIIP-1, was merged with the MPRC. \n14 Thirty-five pourashavas have been identified as the original targets of the Project. They do not include pourashavas \ncovered under UGIIP-1 and have been selected based on the weighted scoring of various factors, including \ndemography, economic growth potential, infrastructure deficiency, investment funds received in recent years, \nincidence of poverty, and regional balance. An additional 15 or so pourashavas will enter the Project during \nimplementation. Please refer to section D. Project Investment Plan, below.  ", "     5   \n \n20.  Water Supply. Subprojects in water supply aim to expand service areas and improve \nservice quality for better access to safe drinking water. Investments include the (i) rehabilitation \nand  expansion  of  distribution  networks;  (ii)  introduction  of  nonrevenue  water  reduction \nprograms;  (iii)  construction  of  tube  wells;  (iv)  procurement  of  equipment  for  metering  and \noperation and maintenance (O&M); and (v) construction of iron- and arsenic-removal facilities.15 \n \n21.  Sanitation. Subprojects in sanitation aim to improve access to hygienic sanitation for \npublic health. Funds are utilized for (i) public and community sanitation facilities;16 (ii) procuring \nequipment for the maintenance of, and sludge removal from, facilities; (iii) constructing sludge \ndisposal facilities; and (iv) an awareness campaign for better hygiene.  \n \n22.  Municipal  Facilities.  Subprojects  in  municipal  facilities  aim  to  enhance  economic \npotential and improve urban amenities. Investments include the development, rehabilitation and \nexpansion  of  (i)  bus  and  truck  terminals,  (ii)  parking  areas,  (iii)  kitchen  markets  and \nslaughterhouses,  (iv)  municipal  parks  and  water  bodies,  (v)  street  lighting,  (vi)  urban \nlandscaping, and (vii) community centers. \n \n23.  Basic Services in Slums. Subprojects described above may be located in slum and \nnon-slum areas. Subprojects in slums will be identified through the development of poverty \nreduction  action  plans  (PRAPs) 17 and  provide  basic  services  to  slum  dwellers.  Slum \nimprovement committees (SICs) will be established to be responsible for O&M. To ensure \nfinancial resources, a minimum of 5% of the investment funds allocated to each pourashava will \nbe earmarked for subprojects in slums.18 \n \n24.  Operation  and  Maintenance.  Physical  assets  will  be  operated  and  maintained  by \npourashavas, SICs, and CBOs.19 An O&M plan for physical assets will be prepared by each \npourashava, with support from the project management office (PMO) and consultants. The PMO \nand consultants will provide manuals and training to relevant pourashava staff and citizen \ngroups.  \n \n2.  Component B: Governance Improvement and Capacity Development  \n25.  The  output  of  component  B  is  improved  governance  and  developed  capacity  in \npourashavas. Pourashavas will carry out series of reform activities in six key areas defined in \nthe  Urban  Governance  Improvement  Action  Program  (UGIAP):  (i)  citizen  awareness  and \nparticipation, (ii) urban planning, (iii) women\u2019s participation, (iv) integration of the urban poor, (v) \nfinancial accountability and sustainability, and (vi) administrative transparency. The UGIAP is \nused in UGIIP-1, and the Project adopts a refined version based on experiences and lessons. \nThe activities will be supported by training and facilitation. The performance of pourashavas will \nbe intensively monitored and assessed to determine the amount of investment funds allocated \nto them. The detailed fund-allocation mechanism and the UGIAP are in Appendix 6.   \n                                                 \n15 Major  works, including source augmentation and the expansion of trunk mains, will be considered only in \nexceptional  cases  and  designed  and  implemented  in  coordination  with  the  Department  of  Public  Health \nEngineering.  \n16 The Project will not finance individual household latrines.   \n17 If a pourashava is implementing a major project funded by the Government or development partners in a slum, in \nprinciple, the Project will not cover subprojects in that slum.   \n18 The subprojects outside of slums may not utilize the earmarked budget, even if the major beneficiaries are poor \nhouseholds.   \n19 SICs focus on activities in slum areas, while CBOs work outside slums to manage community infrastructure.  \n ", "6     \n \n26.  Citizen Awareness and Participation. Each pourashava will form a TLCC, and each \nward will form a WLCC with broad representation of citizen groups.20 The TLCC and WLCCs will \nbe forums for discussing various issues in the pourashava and to ensure the participation of \ndiverse social strata in decision making. To ensure effective participation, the selection of \nmembers  will  follow  a  bottom-up  approach  to  the  extent  possible.  The  accountability  of \npourashavas will be enhanced by establishing a citizen charter, introducing a citizen report \ncard,21 and open discussions on budget proposals at TLCCs and WLCCs.    \n \n27.  Urban  Planning.  Each  pourashava  will  formulate  a  pourashava  development  plan \n(PDP), including its vision, situation assessment, and priority investments and activities for \nimproving  governance.  The  UGIAP  specifically  requires  pourashavas  to  recruit  an  urban \nplanner,22 and the Project will provide adequate capacity development for him or her. The \nProject also supports internships for university students to strengthen urban planning capacity. \nA  land-use  plan  will  be  prepared  for  long-term  planning.  An  inventory  list  of  the  existing \ninfrastructure and an O&M plan will be prepared to ensure the efficient and effective utilization \nof physical assets.  \n \n28.  Women\u2019s Participation. A gender committee headed by a female ward councilor will be \nestablished, and a gender action plan (GAP) will be developed as part of the PDP in each \npourashava. The GAP will be developed with identified budget requirements and implemented \nunder the supervision of the gender committee as part of UGIAP performance criteria. TLCCs \nand  WLCCs  will  have  sufficient  female  representation  to  ensure  female  participation  in \npourashava governance.  \n \n29.  Integration of the Urban Poor. An SIC will be formed in each target slum, and a PRAP \nwill be developed as part of the PDP. The SICs will be responsible for managing community \ninfrastructure  identified  in  the  PRAP.  Outside  of  slums,  CBOs  will  be  formed  to  manage \ncommunity  infrastructure  focusing  on  low-income  groups.  TLCCs  and  WLCCs  will  have \nsufficient  and  fair  representation  of  low-income  groups  to  ensure  their  participation  in \npourashava governance. Representatives of the poor will be nominated from among themselves \nand include the chairperson of the SIC. \n \n30.  Financial  Accountability  and  Sustainability.  Pourashavas  will  computerize  their \naccounting  and  tax  records  to  enhance  the  efficiency  and  transparency  of  financial \nmanagement. An interim assessment of the holding tax will be carried out annually to ensure a \nfair tax base, and collection efficiency will be improved to enhance financial resources. The \nimprovement of tax collection is one area in which substantial improvement was achieved under \nthe UGIIP-1. \n \n31.  Administrative  Transparency.  Elected  leaders,  pourashava  officials,  and  citizen \ngroups will participate in various training programs for administrative transparency and effective \nimplementation  of  the  UGIAP.  A  management  information  system  will  be  introduced,  and \ninformation disclosure will be strengthened for transparency in administration. \n \n                                                 \n20 Each pourashava is typically composed of several wards.  \n21 Introducing a citizen report card is one of the policies supported under ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of \nthe President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of Bangladesh for the Good Governance Program. Manila (Loan 2362-BAN, approved on 30 October). \n22 Applicable to class A pourashavas only. For classes B and C, the assistant engineer serves as the urban planner, \nwith the support of consultants and facilitators.   ", "     7   \n32.  Support for National Reform. The Project supports national reforms with a focus on \nthe UMSU, MPRC, and Local Government Commission. UMSU provides standard training \nmodules to pourashavas, which are covered mostly under ADB or World Bank projects. The \nProject  supports  UMSU\u2019s  expansion  of  the  types  of  training  offered  and  the  coverage  of \npourashavas beyond specific projects. The Government has started taking the MPRC\u2019s review \nof pourashavas\u2019 performance into consideration in allocating the national budget. However, the \nindicators reviewed are limited and the linkage between observed performance and budget \nallocation  is  rather  weak,  with  substantial  discretionary  factors.  The  Project  supports  the \nMPRC\u2019s enhancement of its capacity to monitor and review the performance of pourashavas \nand  strengthen  the  linkage  between  performance  and  budget  allocation.  The  Project  also \nsupports the Local Government Commission\u2019s finalizing of national policy frameworks, including \nthe Urban Sector Policy and its implementing guidelines.      \n \n3.  Component C: Project Management and Implementation Support  \n33.  The PMO in LGED and a project implementation unit (PIU) in each pourashava will be \nestablished  under  component  C  of  the  Project.  The  PMO  will  manage  overall  project \nimplementation,  and  the  PIUs  will  implement  activities  for  governance  improvement  and \nphysical infrastructure development with the support of consultants and facilitators.   \n \nC.  Special Features \n34.  Performance-Based Allocation. The Project adopts the performance-based allocation \nof investment funds, as this has been proven to be an effective incentive mechanism during the \nimplementation of UGIIP-1. The amount of investment funds to be allocated to each pourashava \ndepends on its performance in improving governance as defined in the UGIAP. In phase 1, \npourashavas start governance improvement by developing a PDP and formulating essential \ninstitutions such as the TLCC, WLCCs, and CBOs. Only after successfully completing phase 1 \nwill the pourashava proceed to phase 2 and receive funds for investment. Pourashavas will \nenter phase 3 and receive additional funding if they meet the performance criteria required in \nphase 2. The amount to be received varies depending on the level of performance. \n \n35.  Participatory Urban Planning. The Project introduces participatory urban planning to \npourashavas through the development of PDPs. Broad citizen groups, including women and the \npoor, will be represented in the TLCCs and WLCCs, and a series of consultations will be carried \nout to formulate the PDP. Participatory urban planning makes elected leaders and pourashava \nofficials more accountable to the public and increases transparency in the use of resources and \ntheir performance.   \n \n36.  Pro-poor Urban Development. Each PDP will include a PRAP to identify and formulate \nspecific actions for poverty reduction in the pourashava. An SIC will be established in each \ntarget  slum  to  operationalize  the  PRAP.  The  TLCC  and  WLCCs  will  have  sufficient \nrepresentation of low-income group to ensure their participation in pourashava governance. To \nensure an adequate budget to implement the PRAP, a minimum 5% of investment funds will be \nearmarked to finance basic services in slums. \n \n37.  Private Sector Participation. The Project promotes private sector participation in the \nmanagement of urban infrastructure. For example, the operation and routine maintenance of \nbus and truck terminals will be outsourced to the private sector through competitive bidding. \nPrivate sector participation in solid waste management will be examined to formulate feasible \nmechanisms.   \n ", "8     \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n38.  The project investment cost is estimated at $167.5 million, including taxes and duties of \n$10.7 million.

Fund  Allocation  Among  Pourashavas.  Investment  funds  will  be  allocated  among \npourashavas based on their performance in governance improvement as defined in the UGIAP. \nThe maximum amount to be allocated to each pourashava (the investment ceiling) is Tk250 \nmillion for class A pourashavas, Tk200 million for class B pourashavas and Tk100 million for \nclass C pourashavas, excluding in-kind contributions by pourashavas and beneficiaries.   \n \n40.  Pourashavas that successfully achieve all of the UGIAP performance criteria of phase 1 \nwill proceed to phase 2 and be entitled to utilize at most 50% of the investment ceiling. While it \nis expected that the standard period of phase 1 will be 1.5 years, pourashavas can enter into \nphase 2 earlier after meeting all phase 1 performance criteria. The MPRC\u2019s assessment of \npourashavas\u2019  performance  against  phase  1  criteria  will  be  carried  out  semiannually. \nPourashavas that fail to meet phase 1 performance criteria within 2 years of loan effectiveness \nwill lose entitlement for fund allocation.  \n \n41.  At the end of phase 2, which is expected to be in June 2012, pourashavas\u2019 performance \nwill be rated by the MPRC. The rating will be \u201cfully satisfactory\u201d if the pourashava meets all \nphase 2 performance criteria to a fully satisfactory level, \u201csatisfactory\u201d if the pourashava meets \nall minimum requirements of phase 2 performance criteria, or \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d if the pourashava \nfails to meet all minimum requirements. The fully satisfactory pourashavas will receive at most \n50% of the investment ceiling, the satisfactory pourashavas will receive at most 25%, and \nunsatisfactory pourashavas will receive no additional funding.   \n ", "     9   \n42.  All class A and B pourashavas that are not included under the Project will be informed \nand encouraged to carry out UGIAP activities. New pourashavas that apply for funding will be \nranked by the MPRC based on their level of achievement of UGIAP performance criteria. \nApproximately 15 pourashavas with the highest ranking will be entitled to receive at most 50% \nof the investment ceiling. In the middle of phase 2, the overall fund utilization will be assessed, \nand the candidate pourashavas will be identified. At the end of phase 2, the new pourashavas \nwill be determined by the interministerial steering committee subject to fund availability.  \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n43.  The Government has requested a loan of $87 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. The ADB loan will cover 51.9 % of the total project cost. ADB will \ncover approximately 70% of the pourashavas and finance 90% of their civil works23 and 100% of \ntheir equipment purchases. In addition, ADB will finance 100% of consulting services and 20% \nof incremental recurrent cost.     \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Amount  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  87.0  51.9 \nGTZ  4.7  2.8 \nKfW  36.1  21.6 \nGovernment of Bangladesh  31.7  18.9 \nPourashava  7.3  4.4 \nBeneficiaries  0.7  0.4 \nTotal  167.5  100.0 \nGTZ = Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit, KfW = Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n  \n44.

KfW will \ncover approximately 30% of pourashavas and finance 90% of their civil works (footnote 23) and \n100% of their equipment purchases. GTZ will support part of the capacity development program \nunder the Project. The funds of GTZ and KfW will be provided on parallel bases and self \nadministered.     \n \n45.  The Government of Bangladesh (the Government) will provide local funds equivalent to \n$31.7 million, covering 18.9% of the project cost by financing 10% of the civil works, 100% of \nland acquisition and resettlement, 100% of taxes and duties, and 80% of incremental recurrent \ncost. Pourashavas will finance the equivalent of $7.3 million and beneficiaries $0.7 million. \nPourashavas will contribute land, resettlement costs, and salvage materials for civil works. \nProject beneficiaries will contribute labor for the development of community infrastructure.   \n \n46.  Part of the funds provided by the Government, ADB, and KfW will be relent to the target \npourashavas. Civil works and equipment for revenue-generating subprojects, including water \nsupply, bus terminals, and truck terminals, will be financed 50% as a grant and 50% as a loan \nfor  class  A  pourashavas,  and  70%  as  a  grant  and  30%  as  a  loan  for  class  B \n                                                 \n23 Excluding in-kind contributions by pourashavas and beneficiaries. \n ", "10     \npourashavas. The loan will have an interest charge of 4% for 20 years, including a 5-year grace \nperiod, and will be denominated in local currency.24 The Government will bear the foreign \nexchange risk in repayment to ADB. All other types of subprojects will be funded 100% as a \ngrant.   \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n47.  The Executing Agency of the Project will be LGED, under the supervision of the Local \nGovernment  Division  (LGD)  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural  Development  and \nCooperatives. The PMO will be established in the urban management wing of LGED. Each \ntarget pourashava will establish a PIU. The diagram of implementation arrangements is shown \nin Appendix 8. \n \n48.  Interministerial Steering Committee. The existing interministerial steering committee \nof UGIIP-1 will be expanded to include the Department of Environment and be responsible for \nthe Project. The interministerial steering committee will be chaired by the secretary of LGD and \nconvene whenever necessary but not less than at least once every 3 months. \n \n49.  MPRC. The transparent and fair assessment of performance is critical for the successful \nimplementation of performance-based fund allocation. The MPRC will be responsible for rating \npourashavas. It will be chaired by the secretary of LGD and carry out its assessment and rating \nduties independently of the PMO.   \n \n50.  PMO. The PMO will be established for the overall management of the Project. It will be \nheaded by a full-time project director,25 supported by two full-time deputy project directors, one \nin  charge  of  infrastructure  and  service  delivery  improvement  and  the  other  in  charge  of \ngovernance  improvement  and  capacity  development.  The  PMO  will  be  responsible  for  (i) \nplanning overall project implementation by consolidating plans at the pourashava level; (ii) \nassisting pourashavas in implementing the UGIAP and physical works; (iii) procuring, managing, \nand supervising consultants hired under the Project; (iv) monitoring and supervising project \nimplementation;  (v)  ensuring  compliance  with  assurances,  including  safeguards;  and  (vi) \npreparing and submitting reports, including progress reports and the completion report.  \n \n51.  UMSU.  The  UMSU  will  provide  standard  training  modules  to  pourashavas  in  close \ncoordination with the PMO. Training includes four standard modules: (i) computerization of tax \nrecords, (ii) computerization of accounting, (iii) inventory and mapping of infrastructure assets, \nand (iv) community mobilization. The UMSU will also function as the secretariat of the MPRC in \nassessing  the  performance  of  pourashavas.  The  superintending  engineer  in  the  urban \nmanagement wing of LGED will act as director of the UMSU, and the additional chief engineer \n(urban management) will coordinate activities between the UMSU and the PMO. \n \n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2002.

PIU. A PIU will be established in each pourashava to implement the UGIAP and physical \nworks. The PIU will be headed by the pourashava mayor, who will be assisted by the chief \nexecutive officer. Each PIU includes three sections, the (i) infrastructure improvement section, \nheaded by the executive engineer;26 (ii) urban governance improvement section, headed by the \nsecretary; and (iii) environmental, sanitation, and slum improvement section, headed by the \nhealth  officer.  The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  implementing  governance  improvement \nactivities  defined  in  the  UGIAP;  (ii)  implementing  physical  works,  including  preparing  bid \ndocuments, procuring and supervising contractors, and ensuring safeguard compliance; and (iii) \npreparing the detailed annual work plan and progress reports to the PMO.    \n    \n2.  Subproject Agreements and Subsidiary Loan Agreements \n53.  Each pourashava will enter into a subproject agreement with LGED prior to investment, \nonce it meets the UGIAP performance criteria and becomes entitled to receive investment \nfunds. The subproject agreement will define the scope of the subproject and the roles and \nresponsibilities of the pourashava and LGED. Pourashavas that identify revenue-generating \nsubprojects and thereby qualify to receive loan funds from the Government will enter into a \nsubsidiary loan agreement with the Ministry of Finance prior to investment. The subsidiary loan \nagreement will define the financial obligations of the pourashava, including repayment terms. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n54.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years from 2009 to 2014, with phase 1 from \nJanuary 2009 to June 2010, phase 2 from July 2010 to June 2012, and phase 3 from July 2012 \nto December 2014. Pourashavas may\u2014and are encouraged to\u2014proceed to phase 2 before \nJuly 2010. The assessment of pourashavas against the phase 1 performance criteria of the \nUGIAP will be carried out semiannually. Pourashavas may enter into phase 3 only after July \n2012, as phase 2 performance criteria will be assessed over the fiscal years ending in June \n2011 and June 2012. The LGED organized a workshop in September 2008 to announce the \nUGIAP to the target pourashavas and request them to start advance activities. The detailed \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n4.  Procurement \n55.  Procurement of goods and services under the Project will be carried out in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s Public Procurement Rules (2008), as acceptable to ADB. National competitive \nbidding (NCB) procedures will be applied for works contracts below $2.0 million. NCB will be the \nmajor mode for civil works contracts, as subprojects are small. Equipment and materials will be \nprocured  under  international  competitive  bidding  when  the  estimated  cost  is  more  than \n$500,000 equivalent. Shopping procedures will be used for contracts with an estimated cost \nbetween $10,000 and $100,000. Minor items costing less than $10,000 equivalent may be \npurchased through direct contracting. Bidding for NCB contracts estimated at $500,000 or more \nfor goods and related services, or $1 million or more for civil works, will be advertised on the \nADB website. The summary procurement plan is in Appendix 10.  \n  \n56.  To expedite implementation of the Project, ADB and KfW approved advance action to \nrecruit consultants and procure goods and services. The advanced engagement of consultants \n                                                 \n26 Assistant engineer for class B and C pourashavas. \n ", "12     \nis expected to reach the stage of technical proposal evaluation. The Government was informed \nthat approval of advance action does not commit ADB or KfW to finance the Project. \n  \n5.  Consulting Services \n57.  Consulting services are provided to support project implementation and strengthen the \ninstitutional capacities of the pourashavas and LGED. The consulting services will include 96 \nperson-months  of  international  consultancy  and  4,878  person-months  of  national.  Major \npackages are package 1: governance improvement and capacity development (GICD) and \npackage 2: management, design, and supervision (MDS). The outline of terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 11.  \n \n58.  The  GICD  package  will  require  876  person-months  of  national  consultancy.  GICD \nconsultants will support the PIUs in implementing the UGIAP by providing capacity development \nand facilitation for urban planning, municipal finance, and community mobilization. The MDS \npackage will require 96 person-months of international consultancy and 3,318 person-months of \nnational. MDS consultants will support the PIU in engineering design, bid management, and \nsupervising  physical  works.  MDS  consultants  will  also  support  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard measures. The consultants will provide intensive capacity building and other support \nin the initial phase of the Project that will subsequently be phased out. \n \n59.  Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and the Governments\u2019 Public \nProcurement Rules (2008), as acceptable of ADB. The firms will be selected using the quality-\nand cost-based selection method.27 \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy  \n60.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of LGED and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n \n61.  The proposed Project incorporates several other measures, in addition to the standard \nADB requirements, to deter corruption and increase transparency. LGED will create a project \nwebpage to disclose information about various project matters, including procurement. With \nregard to procurement, the website will include information on, among other things, the list of \nparticipating bidders, name of the winning bidder, basic details on the bidding procedures \nadopted, the amount of contract awarded, and the goods and/or services procured. As part of \nthe UGIAP, each pourashava will form a TLCC with broad citizen representation to discuss \nvarious  issues  of  pourashava  governance.  Detailed  information  on  procurements  in  their \nrespective pourashavas will be provided in the TLCC to supplement the web-based disclosure.  \n \n                                                 \n27 The weight for technical quality will be 80% and for cost 20%. ", "   1  3   \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n62.  Loan  disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements between the \nGovernment and ADB. For larger contracts, direct payment and commitment letter procedures \nwill be used.  For other activities, an imprest account will be established at the Bangladesh Bank, \nwhich will fund a second-generation imprest account (SGIA)28 at a commercial bank selected in \naccordance with the Borrower\u2019s procedures and acceptable to ADB.29 The imprest account and \nthe SGIA will be operated by LGED. The initial amount to be deposited into these imprest \naccounts shall not exceed the equivalent of 6 months\u2019 estimated expenditures to be financed \nfrom imprest account, or 10% of the loan, whichever is less.   \n \n63.  A third-generation imprest account (TGIA)30 will be established by each pourashava at a \ncommercial bank selected in accordance with the Borrower\u2019s procedures and acceptable to \nADB and will be operated by the pourashavas. The Government shall assure ADB that all ADB \ndisbursements for imprest advance and/or replenishment for payment by PIUs will be passed on \nto TGIAs within 30 calendar days of the receipt. The initial amount to be deposited into each \nTGIA shall not exceed the equivalent of 6 months\u2019 estimated expenditures to be financed from \nthat account. The aggregate of the TGIAs shall not exceed the equivalent of ten (10) percent of \nthe Loan amount. The TGIAs are necessary as project implementation will be at the pourashava \nlevel.  \n \n64.  The imprest account, SGIA, and TGIAs will be established, managed, replenished, and \nliquidated  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  detailed \narrangements between the Government and ADB. Statement of expenditure procedures may be \nused  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  made  into  the  imprest \naccount, SGIA, and TGIAs in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and \ndetailed  arrangements  between  the  Government  and  ADB.  Any  individual  payment  to  be \nreimbursed  or  liquidated  under  statement  of  expenditure  procedures  will  not  exceed  the \nequivalent of $100,000.   \n \n65.  LGED has the proven capacity to manage the financial transactions, evidenced by the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  the  UGIIP-1.  Pourashavas  will  be  capable  of  managing  the \nfinancial transactions with capacity development and support from the PMO. The PMO will be \nresponsible for monitoring accounts, including monthly reconciliation of the accounts and the \npreparation of the withdrawal applications for liquidation or replenishment of the imprest account. \nThe disbursement of KfW funds will be managed with equivalent procedures. Supplementary \nAppendix G describes detailed financial management and disbursement arrangements.  \n  \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n66.  The PMO will maintain records and accounts to identify all goods and services financed \nby the proceeds. Each PIU will maintain similar records and submit annual accounts and \nfinancial statements to the PMO for further submission to ADB. The PMO and PIUs will be \nstaffed with an adequate number of suitably qualified accounting personnel. Additionally, the \nPIUs will be assisted by an account assistant deputed by LGED and consultants in establishing \nand managing accounting and recording procedures.  \n                                                 \n28 SGIA is referred as project operating account in Bangladesh, \n29 The Government requires the PMO to open the first generation imprest account in the Bangladesh Bank, which is \nthe country\u2019s central bank, but an account in a commercial bank is needed for day-by-day transactions.   \n30 TGIA is referred as project account in Bangladesh. \n ", "14     \n \n67.  The Government will ensure that accounts and financial statements are audited annually \nin accordance with sound accounting principles by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. \nLGED will provide to ADB, not later than 6 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified \ncopies of audited accounts and financial statements and the report of the auditor of them. The \nimprest account and statement of expenditure records will be audited annually, and a separate \naudit opinion will be provided for each.   \n \n68.  The PIU will prepare quarterly progress reports and submit them to the PMO within 15 \ndays of the end of the applicable period. The PMO will compile them and prepare quarterly \nprogress reports and submit them to ADB and LGD within 30 days of the end of the applicable \nperiod. The reports to ADB will be prepared in a format acceptable to ADB and include the \nfollowing:  (i)  project  progress  in  each  pourashava  regarding  both  physical  works  and \ngovernance improvement, (ii) any delays or problems encountered and the actions to be taken \nto resolve them, (iii) compliance with loan covenants, and (iv) the progress expected during the \nnext 6 months. Within 6 months of the Project\u2019s physical completion, the Government will \nprepare and submit to ADB a project completion report.   \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation    \n69.  The PMO will ensure that a project performance monitoring system, which will operate \nthroughout the implementation period in a manner acceptable to the ADB. The system will \nassess the progress and performance of physical works and governance-improvement activities \nin each pourashava with defined reporting procedures from the PIU to the PMO. A set of \nindicators will be developed at the initial stage of the Project by the PMO, based on the \nexperiences of the UGIIP-1. The PMO, with the support of consultants, will compile information \nincluding socioeconomic, gender and poverty indicators through surveys, reports, and statistical \npublications. The PMO will conduct on-site monitoring to observe activities and receive direct \nfeedback from stakeholders. The PMO will conduct initial baseline physical and socioeconomic \nsurveys and submit a detailed implementation plan for monitoring performance and benchmark \nindicators for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence within 9 months from loan effectiveness.  \n \n10.  Project Review \n70.  The Government, ADB, GTZ, and KfW will jointly review the Project\u2019s progress at least \ntwice a year. In addition to the regular reviews, the Government, ADB, GTZ, and KfW will \nundertake a comprehensive midterm review within 3 years from loan effectiveness. These \nreviews will include a detailed evaluation of the project scope, implementation arrangements, \nfinancing  plan,  achievement  of  scheduled  targets  on  both  physical  and  governance \nimprovement, fund allocation mechanism, UGIAP performance targets, and performance of \ncommittees, consultants and LGED. The midterm review will be carried out at the end of phase \n2 of the Project, and the overall progress of the UGIAP and fund utilization will be assessed to \ndetermine the exact number of new pourashavas to enter the Project.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n71.  Economic Analysis. Since the Project is formulated as sector lending, the economic \nanalysis focuses on the rationale for government involvement, government plan and approach, \neconomic policies, and government capacity. The Project has a clear rationale for government ", "   1  5   \ninvolvement. The infrastructure to be developed under the Project is to meet the basic needs of \ncitizens in target pourashavas. The goals and Government\u2019s approach are sound. Bangladesh \nhas experienced rapid urbanization, which has caused acute shortages of basic infrastructure \nand social services in urban areas. The target pourashavas were selected through a transparent \nscoring of various factors. The subprojects will be selected by developing the PDP with broad \nparticipation to ensure a balanced distribution of benefits. The government\u2019s policy to improve \nthe governance of pourashavas, including better urban planning and financial management, will \nbe supported by the Project. The LGED has been successfully implementing the UGIIP-1, \ndemonstrating sufficient capacity to implement the Project.   \n \n72.  The  economic  analysis  of  subprojects  is  conducted  for  the  six  subprojects  in  pilot \npourashavas. The estimates of the economic internal rates of return (EIRR) of the sample \nsubprojects range from 17% to 44%, indicating sufficiently high economic return. The result is \nrobust against downside risks, including increased capital cost, increased O&M cost, decreased \nbenefits, and delay in project completion. These results are most likely underestimated, since \nthe projects have benefits that are not easily quantifiable and not accounted for in the analysis.   \n \n73.  Financial  Analysis.  Most  subprojects  to  be  developed  under  the  Project  do  not \ngenerate cash revenues, while others, including water supply and bus terminals, generate cash \nrevenues  through  user  charges.  For  revenue-generating  subprojects,  financial  analysis  is \nconducted by estimating the incremental costs and the revenues over the project life. Financial \ninternal  rates  of  return  (FIRRs)  are  estimated  at  5.9%  for  the  water  supply  subproject  in \nRangpur and 7.1% for the bus terminal subproject in Bhanga, which compared favorably with \nthe weighted average cost of capital (WACC), estimated at 3.3%. Sensitivity analysis with \nrespect to changes in cost and revenue assumptions confirmed the robustness of financial \nviability against these downside risks.   \n \n74.  For  nonrevenue-generating  subprojects,  the  analysis  focuses  on  the  pourashavas\u2019 \nfinancial capacity to meet the recurrent costs of the subprojects to operate and maintain the \ndeveloped physical assets in a sustainable manner. The overall financial position of each pilot \npourashava is projected, reflecting the incremental capital, O&M expenditures, revenue through \nuser  charges,  and  debt  service.  The  projected  financial  position  confirmed  their  financial \ncapacity  to  meet  O&M  costs  and  other  requirements  to  sustain  infrastructure  and  service \ndelivery supported under the Project.    \n \nB.  Poverty Reduction and Social Development \n75.  Citizen Participation. The main social issues identified in pourashavas are (i) weak \nparticipation and representation of citizens, particularly the poor and women, in pourashava \ngovernance;  and  (ii)  a  lack  of  access  to  basic  urban  services  for  the  poor.  The  Project \nstrengthens  citizens\u2019  participation through  the  formation of  TLCCs and  WLCCs  with  broad \nrepresentation. All subprojects to be funded under the Project will be selected in a participatory \nmanner to ensure that benefits are shared by a broad range of socioeconomic groups.  \n \n76.  Urban  Poor.  The  Project  includes  specific  supports  for  the  urban  poor.  Each \npourashava is required to utilize at least 5% of allocated funds to improve basic services in \nslums. An SIC will be established in each target slum to develop and implement a PRAP that \nidentifies and formulates the specific infrastructure and activities for poverty reduction. TLCCs \nand WLCCs will have sufficient representation of low-income groups to ensure their participation \nin decision making. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 12. \n \n ", "16     \n77.  Gender. The Project contributes to gender mainstreaming through the development and \nimplementation of a GAP in each pourashava. TLCCs and WLCCs will have sufficient female \nrepresentation  to  ensure  women\u2019s  participation  in  pourashava  governance.  Certain \ninfrastructure to be developed under the Project will directly benefit women. For example, \ndeveloping water supply and sanitation will reduce the burden on women, who traditionally \ncollect water and manage sanitation. The summary gender action plan is in Appendix 13.  \n \nC.  Environmental and Social Safeguards \n78.  Environment  Safeguards.  LGED  has  prepared  initial  environmental  examinations \n(IEEs) for six sample subprojects, a sector IEE, and an environment assessment and review \nprocedure  following  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines  (2003).  The  IEEs  show  that  benefits  are  positive  and  large,  with  infrastructure \nsubprojects: (i) improving the environment in pourashavas by reducing people\u2019s exposure to \npollutants through improved water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, drainage, and \nmunicipal transport; (ii) improving aesthetics with drainage and solid waste management; (iii) \nreducing flooding through drainage improvement; and (iv) other social benefits from subprojects \nfor  the  poor  that  use  an  integrated  approach  and  provide  such  basic  urban  services  as \ncommunity water supply and sanitation. The Project will improve biological systems that rely on \nhealthy  aquatic  environments  through  the  improved  protection  of  surface  water  and \ngroundwater quality. \n \n79.  Any  adverse  environmental  impact  can  be  addressed  through  properly  locating, \nplanning,  and  design  proposed  subprojects;  controlling  construction  activity;  properly \nmaintaining systems following commissioning; and other mitigation measures. The principal \ncumulative, regional, and long-term environmental impacts are expected to be beneficial. The \nIEEs conclude that no further assessment of environmental impacts is required for sample \nsubprojects. To ensure compliance with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines \nand  requirements,  an  environmental  assessment  review  procedure  and  subproject \nenvironmental selection guidelines to guide the implementation of future subprojects have been \nformulated.31 A summary IEE is in Appendix 14. \n \n80.  Social Safeguards. To ensure compliance with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s policy and \nrequirements on involuntary resettlement, a resettlement framework to guide the implementation \nof subprojects has been formulated by LGED. A summary of the resettlement framework is in \nAppendix 15. LGED prepared draft resettlement plans for three sample subprojects following \nthe  Government\u2019s  Acquisition  and  Requisition  of  Immovable  Property  Ordinance  (1982, \namended  in  1993  and  1994),  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and  the \nresettlement framework for the Project.  \n \n81.  The  Project  is  designed  to  minimize  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts. \nPourashavas will (i) utilize existing lands for rehabilitating existing water supply, drainage, and \nmunicipal facilities, and for basic urban services to the urban poor; (ii) utilize vacant pourashava \nor community land and ensure community consensus in siting public and community toilets and \ndeep tube wells; (iii) align roads and bridges to avoid impacts on structures; and (iv) utilize \nvacant pourashava land for solid waste management that will not pose health hazards to \n                                                 \n31 The environmental assessment review procedure documents procedures for the environmental assessment of \nsubprojects,  including  categorization,  preparing  environmental  assessments,  requirements  for  environmental \nmanagement plans, and procedures for public consultation. The section specifies that, should a subproject \nunexpectedly be classified as A, an environmental impact assessment would be required. Public disclosure \nrequirements for category A, including the 120-day requirement, are in the procedure. ", "   1  7   \nsettlements. Impacts are to be further minimized through careful subproject siting and alignment \nduring  detailed  design  and  subproject  implementation.  In  the  three  sample  subprojects, \npermanent land acquisition required for road improvement is 0.024 hectares, affecting five \nhouseholds. Impacts from road improvements and the construction of a bus terminal will be \ntemporary and minimal, as the work will be undertaken on road shoulders and pourashava and \nother government land. \n \n82.  Screening for impact on indigenous peoples shows that the sample subprojects have no \nimpact on them. By design, as reflected in the subproject selection criteria, a subproject will not \nbe eligible if it adversely affects indigenous communities. An indigenous peoples development \nframework has been formulated to ensure that appropriate indigenous peoples development \nplans or specific actions are formulated, enabling equal sharing of project benefits should a \nfuture subproject have impacts on indigenous peoples. \n \nD.  Major Risks and Assumptions \n83.  The major assumption of the Project is that performance-based allocation of investment \nfunds will generate sufficient incentive for pourashavas to carry out a series of activities for \ngovernance  reform  as  defined  in  the  UGIAP.  Also  assumed  is  that  citizens  are  willing  to \nparticipate  in  decision  making  through  TLCCs  and  WLCCs,  and  that  elected  leaders  and \npourashava officials will listen and respond to their voices. The successful experience in the \nUGIIP-1 indicates that performance-based allocation will create sufficiently strong incentives for \ngovernance improvement. Given limited fund availability, it is unlikely that pourashavas will find \nsignificant alternative funding sources, which could undermine the incentive mechanism of \nperformance-based allocation. Further, it is assumed that enhanced citizen participation in and \nmonitoring of the MPRC will establish a sustainable incentive mechanism for elected leaders to \nrespond to citizens\u2019 demands for better urban management and services.  \n \n84.  Other assumptions include the acceptability of a water tariff and the timely placement of \nan urban planner in each PIU. The risk of these factors having significant impacts on the Project \nis assessed to be limited. Water supply is a minor component of the Project, and the tariff will be \nproposed  at  an  acceptable  level  considering  the  income  level  and  practices  in  other \npourashavas. The placement of urban planner is included in the UGIAP performance criteria \nand the assurances of the loan agreement, so that governments have a sufficient incentive to \nensure timely placement.        \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n85.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents:   \n \n(i)  The  Government  will  provide  all  required  and  agreed  counterpart  funds  for \nproject implementation on time.  \n(ii)  LGED  will  ensure  that  all  subprojects  are  selected  and  implemented  in \naccordance  with  the  subproject  selection  criteria  agreed  between  ADB  and \nLGED and set out in Appendix 5. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that all investment funds will be allocated among \npourashavas in accordance with the guidelines set out in Appendix 6.  \n(iv)  LGED  will  ensure  that  at  least  5%  of  the  investment  funds  allocated  to  a \nparticular  pourashava  will  be  earmarked  for  and  spent  on  basic  services  in \nslums.  \n ", "18     \n(v)  LGED will ensure that there will be no overlap of activities or program between \nADB-funded subprojects and projects funded by other development partners. \n(vi)  The guidelines concerning pourashava development plans will include specific \nprovisions for the representation of women and the urban poor in the TLCC and \nWLCCs in each pourashava. Each TLCC will have at least seven representatives \nof the urban poor, and each WLCC at least two; they will be appointed by the \nrespective chairperson but will be nominated by the urban poor themselves and \nwill include the SIC chairperson where an SIC exists, as well as representatives \nfrom CBOs. In addition, there will be at least seventeen female TLCC members \nand four female WLCC members in each pourashava.  \n(vii)  Within 9 months of loan effectiveness, the PMO will conduct initial baseline \nphysical  and  socioeconomic  surveys  and  submit  a  detailed  implementation-\nmonitoring plan for ADB\u2019s review and concurrence. Within 9 months of loan \neffectiveness, the PMO and each PIU will establish a gender-segregated project \nperformance management system. \n(viii)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, each PIU of a class A pourashava will \nhave an urban planner in place. LGD will ensure that this position remains filled \nthroughout project implementation.  \n(ix)  LGD will take all appropriate and necessary measures to ensure that, at all times \nduring project implementation, the PIUs have at least 80% of all their positions \nfilled. \n(x)  The Government will take all appropriate and necessary measures, including \nthrough  bonding  arrangements  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  policy  and \nguidelines, to ensure that pourashava officials who receive training under the \nProject will not be transferred out of the pourashavas under the Project. \n(xi)  The Government will ensure that, within 1 year of loan effectiveness, the Urban \nSector Policy will have been approved. Within 6 months of approval of the policy, \nthe Government will have approved its implementing rules.  \n(xii)  The Government will ensure that sufficient funds to cover the costs of land \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement are made available in a timely manner. \nAll land and right-of-way required will be made available in a timely manner, and \ncompensation  at  replacement  value  and  other  entitlements  will  be  paid  to \naffected people prior to the award of any civil works contract. Any involuntary \nresettlement  or  land  or  asset  acquisition  will  be  in  compliance  with  the \nresettlement framework agreed between LGED and ADB, and the resettlement \nplan for the subproject. Pourashavas will publicly disclose the draft resettlement \nplan in places and using language accessible to all affected people, prior to \nsubmitting to ADB the resettlement plans for review and approval and disclosure \non ADB\u2019s website. External monitoring reports will be submitted to ADB and \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website. \n(xiii)  LGED will ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and relevant \nnational  and  local  environmental  laws  and  regulations.  All  mitigation  and \nmonitoring  mechanisms  set  out  in  the  IEEs,  as  well  as  all  environmental \nassessment and review procedures, will be complied with throughout Project \nimplementation. LGED will ensure environmental requirements are incorporated \nin bidding documents and civil work contracts. \n(xiv)  LGED will ensure that subprojects are prepared and implemented in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) and the Indigenous Peoples \nDevelopment Framework for the Project.  \n(xv)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  comply  with  all \napplicable labor laws, do not employ child labor for construction or maintenance ", "   1  9   \nactivities, and do not differentiate wages between men and women for work of \nequal value. \n(xvi)  The Government will ensure that the birth registration requirements of the 2004 \nBirth  and  Death  Registration  Act  and  its  implementing  rules  will  not  be \nimpediments to obtaining urban services, in particular utility connections.  \n(xvii)  LGED  will  ensure  that  gender  issues  are  duly  considered  in  project \nimplementation in accordance with the Project\u2019s gender action plan and that \nsufficient resources will be allocated for its implementation. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n86.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to fifty-five million four hundred forty-five thousand Special Drawing Rights \n(SDR 55,445,000) to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Second Urban Governance \nand Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; a term of 32

Urbanization  \n \n1.  Bangladesh had a population of 152 million in 2005, of which 38 million (27%) lived in \nurban areas.1 Though this level of urbanization is still relatively low, the urban population has \ngrown rapidly at an annual average rate of 6% since independence, while national population \ngrowth was 2%.2 With current growth rates, the country\u2019s urban population will be 74 million, or \n40% of the population, by 2035.3 Rapid urbanization has occurred because of (i) a high natural \nincrease in urban population, (ii) territorial expansion of urban areas, and (iii) rural-to-urban \nmigration.4 \n \n2.  The contribution of urban areas to the national gross domestic product increased to 42% \nin  1999  from  26%  in  1973.  The  share  is  almost  50%  at  present,  which  underlines  the \nimportance of urban centers in achieving economic growth and poverty reduction. Despite their \nimportance, urban areas have not traditionally received sufficient attention toward developing \npolicies  and  funding  capital  investments.  The  result  is  unplanned  and  uncontrolled  urban \ngrowth,  which  has  caused  acute  shortages  of  infrastructure,  including  poor  housing  and \ntransport, inadequate drinking water, and a lack of drainage and sewerage.      \n  \nB.  Urban Infrastructure and Services   \n \n3.  Urban  residents,  in  particular  low-income  groups,  suffer  a  lack  of  basic  urban \ninfrastructure and services. Though 95% of the population has access to water supply, only \n30%  of  urban  households  drink  tap  water  and  fewer  than  20%  have  their  own  house \nconnections. The water quality is very poor, with arsenic and bacteriological contamination \ncommon. There are virtually no water treatment facilities, and even where treated water is \navailable it is often contaminated at consumer points due to the poor condition of pipes and \nintermittent water flow. \n \n4.  Most  households  use  septic  tanks  and  pit  latrines  without  proper  sludge  removal \nprograms. Wastewater tends to flow into low-lying areas and open drains without treatment, \ncausing significant health risks. During monsoon rains, roads and pathways that lack drains \nbecome flooded, impeding access to houses and posing health risks to residents. Solid waste \ndisposal is another major problem in urban areas, particularly in slums and other densely \npopulated areas. Only around 20% of urban households are covered by a solid waste collection \nsystem. \n \n5.  Only 25% of urban households live in permanent structures (footnote 1), and the rest live \nin temporary kutcha structures in illegal settlements with uncertain tenure and no access to \nbasic urban services. Surveys of the urban poor have shown that access to piped water is very \nlimited. In Rangpur, for example, piped water reaches only 25% of the population, with the \nprovision of merely 20 liters per capita per day, and 48% of the population gets water only from \nhand-pumped tube wells.  \n \n6.  According to the National Sanitation Strategy5 about 40% of households resort to open \ndefecation or use unsanitary hanging latrines. Most slum dwellers rarely use community toilets \nbecause they are poorly maintained. Slum areas rarely have solid waste-management systems, \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2006.

Air \nand water pollution is common in most urban areas.    \n \nC.  Urban Poverty  \n \n7.  Bangladesh has made steady progress toward achieving the Millennium Development \nGoals, though the challenges remain daunting. Between 1992 and 2005, Bangladesh reported a \nsignificant reduction in people living below the poverty line, from 59% to 42%, one of the fastest \ndeclines in the world (footnote 3). The urban population living below the poverty line declined \nfrom 45% to 37% during the 1990s.6 Later estimates have indicated that urban poverty has \nbeen  reduced  further  to  30%.  Bangladesh\u2019s  National  Strategy  for  Accelerated  Poverty \nReduction7 addresses other urban issues as well, recognizing the potential of urbanization to \nreduce poverty and emphasizing the need for a holistic perspective on urban poverty.  \n \n8.  Economic opportunities in urban areas attract large numbers of migrants from rural \nareas. New migrants, as well as second-generation migrants, tend to live in slum areas with \nsubstandard housing and no basic services. Inequality among households is acute in urban \nareas, contrasting the rich in central business districts and the poor in urban slums. \n \nD.  Institutional Settings of Municipalities   \n \n9.  The structure of local urban governments has remained unchanged for a long time. It is \na two-tier structure with city corporations for the largest six cities and pourashavas for the \nremaining 300 or so smaller cities. Local urban governments are formed through a democratic \nelection process, with the mayor and councilors elected by direct vote of citizens. However, \nlocal  urban  governments  do  not  enjoy  political,  administrative,  or  financial  autonomy.  For \nexample, they cannot themselves employ high-level staff, as these are recruited and appointed \nby  the  Local  Government  Division  (LGD)  under  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural \nDevelopment, and Cooperatives. Within local urban government, administrative authority is \nconcentrated in the mayor. \n  \n10.  Municipalities are mandated to provide urban services, including (i) maintaining roads, \ndrainage, and parks; (ii) operating water supply systems, community toilets, markets, solid \nwaste management, and slaughterhouses; (iii) delivering public health and other basic services \nfor  the  urban  poor;  and  (iv)  development  and  building  control.  In  practice,  however, \nmunicipalities  lack  the  institutional  capacity  to  provide  these  services.  Municipalities  have \napproved organizational charts, but many posts are long left vacant. \n \n11.  Insufficient financial resources are another reason why municipalities cannot provide \nadequate infrastructure and services. Municipalities depend on the national Government for \nmuch of their financial sources, and their own financial resources are limited by a small tax base \nand  low  collection  efficiency.  Between  2000  and  2002,  only  29%  of  smaller  pourashavas \ncollected more than half of their estimated holding tax, which is the most important source of \nown  revenue  (footnote  2).  Consequently,  there  is  a  chronic  shortage  of  funds  for  capital \nexpenditure as well as for operation and maintenance. \n \nE.  National Policies for the Urban Sector \n \n12.  Although the Government has long been aware of the rapid pace of urbanization and the \nassociated physical, economic, and social problems, it has not yet managed to formulate a \ncomprehensive urban policy. Efforts have been made over the past 2 decades to develop \npolicies for specific areas like housing, planning, and urban services. The National Housing \nPolicy  (1993),  Bangladesh  Urban  and  Shelter  Review  (1993),  Bangladesh  Urban  Sector \nNational  Program  Document  (1994),  Bangladesh  National  Habitat  II  Report  (1996),  and \n                                                 \n6  ADB and World Bank. 2002. Poverty in Bangladesh, Building on Progress. Dhaka. \n7  Government of Bangladesh. 2005. Bangladesh\u2019s National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction, 2005. \nDhaka. \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nBangladesh National Habitat II Istanbul +5 Report (2001) have all underscored the importance \nof proper urbanization in national development. The Urban Management Policy Statements \n(1994 and 1999) prepared by the LGD emphasized that all pourashavas should have adequate \npersonnel and financial strength, provide and maintain basic infrastructure facilities, prepare and \nimplement land-use plans, address poverty, ensure participation, and involve the private sector. \nThese policy statements, however, were never approved by the Government.  \n \n13.  With the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB),8 the committee for urban local \ngovernments  was  formed  to  examine  national  policy  issues  including  amendments  to  the \nPourashava  Ordinance  (1977)  and  the  draft  Urban  Sector  Policy.  Based  on  the \nrecommendations of the committee, a new Pourashava Ordinance (2008) was approved on 14 \nMarch 2008 by the Government. The new ordinance redefines urban areas; constitutes standing \ncommittees; and enhances citizens\u2019 participation through committees with representatives from \nprofessional  groups,  citizens  groups,  and  the  urban  poor.  The  recommendations  were \nformulated based on experiences in governance reform under the Urban Governance and \nInfrastructure  Improvement  (Sector)  Project  (UGIIP-1).  For  example,  under  UGIIP-1,  each \npourashava  formed  committees  representing broad  citizens\u2019  groups,  namely  the  town-level \ncoordination committee (TLCC) and ward-level coordination committees (WLCCs). The TLCC \nand WLCCs are forums to discuss various issues of pourashava management and ensure the \nparticipation of diverse social strata in decision making. The new Pourashava Ordinance (2008) \nhas made committees with citizen representatives a statutory requirement for pourashavas.9 \n \n14.  The  Government  approved  on  12 March  2008  an  ordinance  to  establish  the  Local \nGovernment Commission as the first permanent institution to oversee the policy development of \nlocal governments. The Local Government Commission is expected to review and finalize the \nUrban Sector Policy. \n \n15.  The committee for urban local governments developed a draft Urban Sector Policy, \nwhich is yet to be approved.  The Government prioritized the approval of the new ordinance for \npourashavas and city corporations to prepare for local government elections. The draft policy \ntakes a comprehensive approach to addressing urban issues, recognizing the importance of \ncapacity development and good governance in municipalities. While the approval of the Urban \nSector  Policy  improves  the  environment  for  pourashava  governance,  the  Second  Urban \nGovernance  and  Infrastructure  Improvement  (Sector)  Project  (the  Project),  in  particular \ngovernance reform under Urban Governance Improvement Action Program (UGIAP), can be \nwell implemented even without the national policy, as evidenced by UGIIP-1. \n \n16.  The Government has been gradually formulating a nationwide institutional framework for \nurban  development  by  consolidating  initiatives  supported  by  various  projects.  The  Local \nGovernment Engineering Department (LGED) is strengthening its urban management wing by \nappointing a senior engineer dedicated to urban development. The Urban Management Support \nUnit (UMSU) was created in LGED by consolidating capacity-development programs supported \nby various projects. A municipal performance review committee (MPRC) was also established to \nreview and monitor the performance of pourashavas. The MPRC, chaired by the secretary of \nLGD, covers all pourashavas supported by different projects, and UMSU supports the MPRC as \nits secretariat. \n                                                 \n8  The technical assistance for Supporting Urban Governance Reform, approved on 28 November 2002 is attached to \nADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President on a Proposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project. \nManila.  \n9  The new ordinance requires pourashavas to establish a committee with 50 members at most to cover the whole \npourashava and a committee with 10 members at most in each ward. These are equivalent to TLCCs and WLCCs. \n ", "                   Appendix 3  27\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE URBAN SECTOR  \n(1996\u20132008) \n \nAmount  Implementation \nName of Project  Executing Agency \n($ million)  Period \nA.

Fund Allocation Mechanism \n1.  Investment Ceiling. The maximum amount of funds to be allocated to each pourashava \n(the  investment  ceiling)  is  Tk250  million  for  class  A  pourahsavas,  Tk200  million  for  class  B \npourahsavas, and Tk100 million for class C pourahsavas. The investment ceiling does not include \nin-kind contributions by pourashavas and beneficiaries. \n \n2.  Financing  Pattern.  Civil  works  and  equipment  for  revenue-generating  subprojects, \nincluding water supply, bus terminals, and truck terminals, will be financed 50% by grant and 50% \nby loan for class A pourashava and 70% by grant and 30% by loan for class B pourashava. The \nloan will have an interest rate of 4% for 20 years, including a 5-year grace period, and will be \ndenominated in the local currency. All other types of subprojects will be funded 100% by grant. \n \n3.  Entry to Phase 2. Pourashavas that successfully achieve all performance criteria of phase \n1 of the Urban Governance Improvement Action Program (UGIAP) will proceed to phase 2 and be \nentitled to utilize a maximum of 50% of the investment ceiling. While the expected average period \nof phase 1 is 1.5 years, pourashavas can enter into phase 2 immediately after the compliance of all \nphase 1 performance criteria. The assessment of pourashavas\u2019 performance by the municipal \nperformance review committee (MPRC) will be carried out semiannually. Pourashavas that do not \nmeet any of the phase 1 performance criteria within 2 years from the beginning of phase 1 will lose \nall entitlement for fund allocation. \n \n4.  Entry  to  Phase  3.  At  the  end  of  phase  2,  which  is  expected  to  be  in  June  2012, \npourashavas\u2019 performance will be rated by the MPRC. The rating will be \u201cfully satisfactory\u201d if the \npourashava meets all of the phase 2 performance criteria of the UGIAP to a fully satisfactory level, \n\u201csatisfactory\u201d if the pourashava meets all of the minimum requirements of the phase 2 performance \ncriteria, or \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d if the pourashava does not meet all of the minimum requirements. The \nadditional entitlement in phase 3 is 50% of the investment ceiling for pourashavas with a fully \nsatisfactory rating, 25% of the investment ceiling for pourashavas with a satisfactory rating, and \nnothing for pourashavas with an unsatisfactory rating.   \n \n5.  New Entry. Within 1 year after the end of phase 1, all class A and B pourashavas that are \nnot included under the Second Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project \n(the Project) will be informed and encouraged to implement the UGIAP. The MPRC will rank those \npourashsavas that apply for fund allocations under the Project according to the performance \ncriteria of the UGIAP. Pourashavas with a high ranking will be entitled to utilize a maximum of 50% \nof their investment ceiling. In the middle of phase 2, the overall fund utilization will be assessed, \nand the candidate pourashavas will be identified. At the end of phase 2, the new pourashavas will \nbe determined by the interministerial steering committee subject to fund availability. \n \nB.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nPoverty incidence in urban areas of Bangladesh is currently estimated at 32.6% (Poverty Monitoring Survey, 2004). With a \npopulation growth rate of almost 6%, or three times the national average, expanding urban areas have a growing number of \nurban poor. Urban poverty is associated with poor-quality housing, often in overcrowded, unsanitary slum settlements. The \nurban poor have limited access to urban services such as water supply, sanitation, drainage, flood protection, local roads, \npublic transport, street lighting, etc.  \nThe proposed Second Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project (the Project) is closely linked to the \nNational Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction (2005), which recognizes that growing disparities in living standards in \nthe cities is emerging as an important policy concern. Unplanned city growth, illegal encroachments on public land, poor \nurban governance, and a lack of policy attention to the needs of the informal sector are some of the key factors identified in \nthe strategy as exacerbating the problem of urban poverty. According to the strategy, critical policy entry points include \nmitigating public health risks by improving access to water, sanitation, and adequate solid waste management; addressing the \nservice needs of both transient settlements and more stable poor neighborhoods; strong and effective policy support to the \ninformal sector; and better utilization of public urban land for community purposes and the needs of the poor. The proposed \nProject has been designed to address these issues in particular by focusing on support to low-income areas, including slum \nareas, in terms of improved access to basic urban services. The proposed Project is designed to empower poor people, \nensuring that they have access to the urban decision-making process and can be involved in planning, implementing, and \nmonitoring urban infrastructure in their communities.  \nThe project focuses on ADB\u2019s continuing role in providing support for social development. It aims to facilitate access for the \npoor, women, and excluded groups; improve infrastructure in urban slums; and improve the delivery of water supply and \nsanitation services in a financially sustainable manner in urban areas. Furthermore, the country strategy and program focuses \non good governance through support for improved local governance; decentralizing and strengthening local government; \nimproving local resource mobilization, planning, and management capacity; and supporting the involvement of communities \nand the private sector in planning and delivering local services.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:   General intervention \n \n1.  Key Issues  \nBangladesh has a total area of 147,000 square kilometers and a population of 140 million. At 950 people per square \nkilometer, it has one of the world\u2019s highest population densities. The country is vulnerable to a variety of natural disasters that \nbring hardship to its people, nearly 42% of whom live below the poverty line. In the past 3 decades, Bangladesh has \nexperienced high urban population growth at 2.5% per annum, owing to rural landlessness, employment opportunities in the \ncities,  and  the  stagnating  economy  in  the  countryside.  About  35  million  people  live  in  the  country\u2019s  six  cities,  308 \npourashavas, and 208 smaller urban settlements.  Safe drinking water is inaccessible to 6 million urban people; 40% of urban \nhouseholds resort to open defecation or use unsanitary hanging latrines; and only 25% of the urban households live in \npermanent structures. Local governments are responsible for addressing these issues, but lack of capacity, constrained \nfinancial resources due to poor tax collection, and the lack of institutional incentives or accountability to citizens prevent \nimprovement. Meanwhile, the continuing rise in urban population means that, by 2015, an estimated 51 million of the \ncountry\u2019s  projected  population  of  167  million  will  live  in  urban  areas.  This  poses  considerable  demand  for  housing, \ninfrastructure, and social services in pourashavas.   \nIn Bhanga, Rangpur, and Cox\u2019s Bazar, half of the people living in slum settlements are extremely poor. More than half are \nfunctionally illiterate, and the main occupations are day labor and small trade. Around 35% of the slum dwellers do not have \nelectricity, and almost 32% do not have access to safe drinking water. Sanitation facilities and solid waste collection are \ninadequate. In Rangpur, the sanitation situation is very poor, with no solid waste collection. Unsafe water and unhygienic \nconditions contribute to a high prevalence of waterborne diseases, with the poor, women, and children most at risk. High rates \nof morbidity and mortality derive from the use of shallow hand-pumped tube wells, which can be contaminated with arsenic; \nopen wells and ponds, which can be contaminated with arsenic and bacteria. In the three pourashavas, the most common \ndiseases are diarrhea, dysentery, parastic worms, and skin disorders.   \n \nThe proposed Project targets the poor in particular in terms of improving access to urban infrastructure and services, including \n ", "44  Appendix 12 \nimproved water supply and sanitation facilities; the construction of drainage facilities; and the establishment of solid waste \nmanagement systems. A poverty reduction action plan will be prepared, outlining the infrastructure to be supported and the \nneeded capacity development. The proposed Project will empower poor groups by ensuring that they are involved in urban \ndecision-making processes and participate in town and ward coordination committees. The urban poor will be involved in \nplanning and prioritizing urban infrastructure in pourashavas through the preparation of pourashava development plans. The \nProject will indirectly support the urban poor by building the capacity of pourashavas to conduct pro-poor planning and by \ncreating employment opportunities for the poor.       \n \n2. Design Features. Not applicable \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nHousehold surveys conducted during the preparation of the proposed Project reveal that the numbers of slums and clusters of \npoor people is significant in all three pourashavas covered. Housing conditions in slums and cluster areas are very poor, and \naccess to services is limited. None of the slum dwellers has access to piped water. The main problems related to access to \nwater, as reported by slum dwellers, are long distances to water points, inadequate supply, and poor quality. In spite of the \npoor quality, the vast majority of slum dwellers do not treat drinking water, and this increases the incidence of waterborne \ndiseases in these areas. Though most of the slum dwellers reported that they have access to latrines, most of them are \nhanging latrines, which do not provide sanitary conditions. More than half of slum areas in Cox\u2019s Bazar do not have covered \ndrains, creating breeding grounds for mosquitoes. The drains are rarely cleaned, which results in blockage and overflow. All \nrespondents reported that no garbage bins or solid waste management system exist. Many are forced to bury their garbage or \ndump it on streets or into drains or rivers.  \n \nThe main occupations of poor men are rickshaw pulling, fishing, and day labor. Most women are engaged in domestic work. \nThe rate of illiteracy in high among adults. School attendance is as low as 30% in Cox\u2019s Bazar, where the dropout rate before \ncompleting primary school is as high as 90%. The reasons for the high dropout rate are the long distance to school, especially \nfor slum dwellers, and low family income, which requires children to start work at an early age. As there are no health services \nin or near the slum areas, child birth routinely takes place in the home, creating risks to mothers and newborns. Female-\nheaded households account for 10% of all households in Cox\u2019s Bazar. The household survey included citizens\u2019 perception of \nthe services provided by the pourashavas. Almost all of them were dissatisfied, and they emphasized that they were not \ninvolved in decision-making regarding urban services. Little or no communication exists between pourashava officials and \ncitizens regarding poor service delivery.  \n \nMost roads in slum areas are extremely poor, with no cleaning or maintenance. The poor road conditions cause problems \ngetting patients to the health center and more general problems during natural disasters and the rainy season.   \n \nIn Bhanga, one of the pourashavas to be included in the proposed Project has no slum, but it does have clusters of poor \npeople. Most of the people living in these clusters do no have access to piped water, 83% of poor people do not have their \nown latrines, and 17% use open space for defecation. There is no door-to-door collection of solid waste, and almost all \nrespondents reported that streets were not swept daily. Half of the poor people are functionally illiterate. Their main \noccupations are small trading or day labor. In the cluster areas, 35% do not have electricity.   \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \nWorkshops  were  held  in  three  pourashavas  as  part  the  Project  mission-visioning  activities  for  preparing  pourashava  \ndevelopment plans (PDPs). Consultations were carried out on 1 November 2007 in Bhanga, 6 November 2007 in Cox Bazar, \nand 9 November 2007 in Rangpur. The workshops were attended by elected and appointed officials of the pourashavas, \ncommunity-based organizations, businessmen, women, and poor urban residents. During the workshops, the stakeholders \nidentified slum areas in their respective pourashavas, the main issues in regard to basic urban services, and priority areas for \nsubprojects to be financed under the Project. Subsequent public consultations were carried out on 25 November in Bhanga, \n17 December in Cox\u2019s Bazar, and 27 December in Rangpur to confirm the proposed subprojects. The involvement of \nstakeholders in identifying the main issues and priority areas for improved urban services has created strong ownership of the \nProject among all groups. \n ", "       Appendix 12      45 \n2.

Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \n   The preparation of the PDP is participatory. The PDP is a town-wide plan prepared by the pourashavas to identify \ndevelopment priorities supported by technical and financial feasibility studies. The PDP has both a long-term vision and a \nshort- to medium-term development plan.   \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \n \nPrimary and secondary data have been analyzed to assess the status of women in the three pourashavas. Socially prescribed \nroles limit women\u2019s access to economic resources such as capital, skills, and marketing know-how. These same social norms \nlimit women\u2019s participation in political and other forms of decision making that affect their lives. Gender disparities are still \nmarked in many aspects of the labor market. The gap in wage rates between men and women is significant. Women\u2019s \nemployment is concentrated in sectors with low returns on labor and is often temporary. Key social development indicators \ndemonstrate gaps between male and female members of the same household. Maternal mortality rates remain high, and food \nconsumption patterns that favor boys create gender gaps in malnutrition.  \n \nThe survey conducted during the preparation of the proposed Project shows that the average annual income of households \nheaded by women is 70% less than of households headed by men. Female illiteracy is 5 percentage points higher than male \nilliteracy. Parallel to this disparity, access to piped water supply and sanitary latrines is lower among female-headed \nhouseholds. Drinking water is largely sourced from hand-pumped tube wells, open wells, and ponds, putting female-headed \nhouseholds at higher risk of arsenic contamination and other waterborne diseases. Moreover, household and community \nwater collection and water and sanitation management are traditionally female roles. Thus, women are vulnerable to health \nrisks from deficiencies in water, hygiene, and sanitation in the households and the community. Their access to latrines and \nsanitation facilities is often reduced by gender insensitivity in their construction and management.  \n \nThough the law provides 25% quotas for women\u2019s election into local governments, women\u2019s participation and decision-\nmaking roles in community, ward, and pourashava affairs are very limited.   \n \n2.

The gender action plan includes the following strategies to ensure that women \nbenefit from the proposed Project, and that they are empowered to participate in urban decision-making processes: (i) the \nformation of pourashava gender committees providing guidance on how to mainstream gender aspects in urban development \nplans and of community-based organizations with extensive involvement of women; (ii) equal representation of women in \nsector working groups; (iii) the design of gender sensitization programs for pourashava staff; (iv) the development of clear \nterms of reference on the roles and responsibilities of female ward commissioners;a and (v) the provision of training as \nneeded. The Project will develop disaggregated indicators monitoring implementation. Contractors will be required to ensure \nequal pay for men and women. Women will be trained in operating and maintaining community infrastructure.   \nIII.

Introduction, Description of the Project, and Description of the Environment \n \n1.  The Second Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project (the \nProject) will promote human development and good urban governance in 35 selected secondary \ntowns (pourashavas) by providing investments consistent with pourashava development plans \n(PDPs), attention to the operation and maintenance of facilities, and greater fiscal responsibility \nfor the participating local governments. The Project has three components: (i) basic urban \ninfrastructure and service delivery (water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, drainage, \nmunicipal transport and communications, municipal facilities, and basic urban services to the \nurban  poor),  (ii)  governance  improvement  and  capacity  development,  and  (iii)  project \nmanagement and implementation support. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) for sample \nsubprojects1 and a sector IEE were prepared (Supplementary Appendixes K and L). The IEEs \nwere based on a review of investment proposals; field visits, secondary data, and geographic \ninformation system imagery to characterize the environment and identify potential impacts; and \ninterviews and discussions with stakeholders. Salient points from the IEEs are summarized \nbelow. \n \n2.  Bangladesh  has  a  subtropical  monsoon  climate  characterized  by  wide  seasonal \nvariations in rainfall, moderately warm temperatures, and high humidity. There are about 700 \nrivers, groundwater is abundant, and aquifers are highly productive. Alluvial soils of varying but \nrelatively young age, dating from the Holocene and Pleistocene, predominate throughout the \ncountry. Bangladesh falls within the tropical and subtropical moist forest biome of the Indo-\nMalayan  bio-geographic  realm.  Wetlands  throughout  the  country  are  a  great  source  of \nbiodiversity  for  Bangladesh.  Both  marine  and  freshwater  artisanal  fisheries  are  prominent. \nBangladesh is ethnically homogeneous, with the Bengali ethnic and linguistic group comprising \n98%  of  the  population.  The  current  population  is  between  150  and  160  million,  and  the \npopulation growth rate is 2.1%, having slowed from around 6% in the 1960s. The United \nNations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific reports strong growth in the \neconomy,  sustained  by  buoyant  private  consumption  and  continual  increase  in  private \ninvestment. \n \nB.  Environmental Impact Forecasting and Mitigation \n \n3.  The Project is designed to maximize environmental and public health benefits. Benefits \nare  positive  and  large,  with  infrastructure  subprojects  (i)  improving  the  environment  in \npourashavas  by  reducing  residents\u2019  exposure  to  pollutants  through  improved  water  supply \nsanitation, solid waste management, drainage, and municipal transport; (ii) improving aesthetics \nwith better drainage and solid waste management; and (iii) and reducing flooding through \ndrainage improvement. Other social benefits will derive from subprojects for the urban poor, \nimplemented  using  an  integrated  approach,  that  provide  such  basic  urban  services  as \ncommunity water supply and sanitation. The Project will improve biological systems that rely on \nhealthy aquatic environments through improved protection of surface water and groundwater \nquality. \n \n4.  The Project provides a significant mechanism for enhancing the environment. Potential \nadverse environmental impacts are primarily associated with unrealized benefits, which may \noccur due to failures in implementing the Project in accordance with good engineering practice. \nAnother  potential  negative  impact  is  related  to  construction,  where  failure  to  follow \nenvironmental subproject selection guidelines may adversely affect surrounding communities, \nthough with limited intensity and short duration. Some potential adverse impacts have been \nidentified with regard to the serviceability of infrastructure during operation. All identified adverse \nimpacts  can  be  mitigated.  Measures  include  properly  locating,  planning,  and  designing \nproposed  subprojects;  controlling  construction  activity;  and  properly  maintaining  systems \nfollowing commissioning. No irreversible environmental impacts are associated with the Project. \n                                                 \n1  The  sample  subprojects  are  for  a  bus  terminal,  roads  improvement,  and  water  supply  in  Bhanga;  road \nimprovement in Cox\u2019s Bazar; and drainage, solid waste management, and water supply and sanitation in Rangpur. \n ", "       Appendix 14      49 \n \n5.  The analysis indicates that likely negative impacts are insignificant in terms of overall \nimpacts and the absolute amount of resources affected; that amount relative to existing stocks \nof resources; the intensity, timing and duration of works; and the probability of negative impacts, \nif environmental subproject selection guidelines are complied with and mitigation measures are \nincorporated in project development. The guidelines aim to minimize negative impacts related to \nimproper locating or planning. Subproject IEEs provide mitigation measures for impacts related \nto  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance.

A sector analysis has been undertaken through descriptions of sample subprojects and \nfuture  subprojects,  descriptions  of  the  greater  environment  in  which  the  infrastructure \nsubprojects will take place, and analysis of sector-wide impacts due to cumulative effects, with \n ", "       Appendix 14      51 \nconsideration for timing, scale, and intensity of impacts. As the 35 pourashavas that have been \nselected for the Project are distributed approximately equally throughout the country, the Project \narea  is  national  in  its  domain.  Evaluation  of  cumulative,  regional,  and  long-term  impact \nscenarios show that such impacts are unlikely to occur. The principal cumulative, regional, and \nlong-term impact is expected to be beneficial: the overall improvement of social, public sector \ninfrastructure in pourashavas. This is best assessed through project monitoring and evaluation. \n \nC.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n7.  The Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) is the Executing Agency. A \nproject management office (PMO) will be established within LGED. The PMO\u2019s responsibilities \ninclude ensuring the implementation of IEEs and the environmental assessment and review \nprocedure (EARP). Project implementing units (PIUs) will be established in each pourashava. \nThe PIUs will oversee environmental concerns related to subproject implementation, and their \nresponsibilities include preparing and updating IEEs consistent with the EARP.  \n \n8.  Design, supervision, and management (DMS) consultants will be recruited by the PMO \nto provide assistance to the PMO and PIUs. The DMS consultants include an international \nenvironment specialist (IES) and a national environment specialist (NES) based in the PMO. \nThere will also be six regional environment specialists (RESs).2 The IES and NES will provide \ntechnical support to the Environmental and Social Unit (ESU), including reviewing and updating \nthe EARP and guidelines for specific types of subprojects and assisting in preparing terms of \nreference for environmental assessment. The RESs will support environmental management \nfunctions including updating subproject IEEs in respect to environmental management plans, \nassisting  in  preparing  IEEs,  and  assisting  in  monitoring  impacts  and  mitigation  measures \nassociated with subprojects.  \n \n9.  Environmental review of subprojects will consist of screening in the pourashava by the \nPIU and the preparation of the IEE through the RESs. The DMS consultant will assist PIUs in \nsubproject preparation and implementation. Review will be conducted at the divisional level of \nthe Department of Environment, in conjunction with a review panel set up by the pourashavas. \nThis  will  involve  the  formation  of  a  committee  made  up  of  the  pourashava  chairman  (as \ncommittee chairman), the project director, a deputy director of Department of Environment \nserving as a divisional director, and other appointees from relevant district offices. The PIU will, \nworking with the RESs, assist in preparing the IEE and environmental impact assessment, \ncapacity building and training, preparing guidelines and procedures, and subproject-specific \nguidance. Environmental monitoring will be undertaken by the PIU supported by the RESs, IES, \nand NES. \n \n10.  The RESs will be required to include mitigation measures in designs, where appropriate, \nand to specify other measures in construction contracts. Contractors will be required by their \ncontracts to implement all specified mitigation, monitoring, and reporting obligations to them in \nsubproject IEEs.  \n \nD.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n11.  The  Project  takes  a  participatory  approach  with  parallel  activities:  stakeholder \nconsultations,  socioeconomic  surveys,  and  initiation  of  pourashava  development  plans  by \nmeans of open, facilitated sessions for ward and pourashava visioning or planning. A wide \nrange of stakeholders have had the opportunity to make substantive contributions concerning \nexisting conditions and preferences. Within a given community, about 1,200 people have been \nexposed to the concept of the Project by their direct involvement, and through citizen\u2019s groups \nand ward committees. \n \n                                                 \n2  Environment specialists will have tasks in capacity building that are included in their terms of reference, which is \nattached to the EARP as an appendix. Capacity building will take various forms, including formal training in \nenvironmental assessment procedures and methodology, the implementation and monitoring of environmental \nmanagement plans, and on-the job training directly related to implementing subprojects during the loan period. \n ", "52  Appendix 14 \n12.  Public consultations on environmental safeguards were held in each of the pourashavas \nfor phase 1 of the Project.3 A project brief was prepared for each pourashava that provided an \noverview  of  potential  environmental  impacts  and  explained  proposed  mitigation  measures. \nParticipants came from the communities directly affected by the subprojects, members of ward \ncommittees, representatives of local nongovernment organizations, and representatives of local \ngovernment agencies. No significant issues were raised during public consultations that have \nnot been addressed in the IEEs, nor were there issues that pose a significant constraint in the \nimplementation of proposed subprojects. A proposal has been described in IEEs for continuing \nthe process of public consultation during construction that includes a mechanism for redress of \ngrievances that arise then. All IEEs and other relevant documents will be made available at \npublic locations in the towns and will be disclosed to a wider audience via the ADB website.  \n \nE.  Environmental Selection Guidelines and Environmental Review Framework \n \n13.  To  ensure  compliance  with  the  environmental  guidelines  and  requirements  of  the \nGovernment of Bangladesh and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), environmental subproject \nselection guidelines and an EARP have been developed to guide the implementation of future \nsubprojects.  The  EARP  details  the  (i)  government  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedures,  (ii) responsibilities  and  authorities  involved  in  environmental  assessment  and \nreview,  (iii) compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines,  (iv)  staffing  requirements  and \nbudgets, and (v) subproject environmental selection guidelines. It also documents procedures \nfor the environmental assessment of subprojects, including categorization, the preparation of \nenvironmental  assessment,  requirements  for  environmental  management  plans,  and \nprocedures for public consultation. The section specifies that, should a subproject unexpectedly \nbe  classified  as  A,  an  environmental  impact  assessment  is  required.  Public  disclosure \nrequirements for category A, including the 120-day requirement, are in the EARP. \n \nF.  Findings, Recommendations, and Conclusion \n \n14.  The IEEs show that the sample subprojects will bring large net environmental benefits \nand  that  any  adverse  environmental  impact  can  be  addressed  through  properly  locating, \nplanning,  and  designing  proposed  subprojects;  controlling  construction  activity;  properly \nmaintaining  systems  following  their  commissioning;  and  other  mitigation  measures.  The \nprincipal  cumulative,  regional,  and  long-term  environmental  impacts  are  expected  to  be \nbeneficial:  the  overall  improvement  of  social,  public  sector  infrastructure  in  the  urban \nenvironments of pourashavas. Environmental subproject selection guidelines and the EARP \nhave  been  developed  to  ensure  the  implementation  of  future  subprojects  complies  with \nenvironmental guidelines and the requirements of the Government of Bangladesh and ADB. No \nfurther assessment of environmental impact is required for the sample subprojects. \n \n                                                 \n3  On 25 November 2008 in Bhanga with 40 participants, 17 December 2007 in Cox\u2019s Bazar with 50 participants, and \n30 December 2008 in Rangpur with 29 participants.  \n ", "       Appendix 15      53 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The  Second  Urban  Governance  and  Infrastructure  Improvement  (Sector)  Project  (the \nProject) will promote human development and good urban governance in 35 selected secondary \ntowns (pourashavas) by providing investments consistent with pourashava development plans \n(PDPs), attention to the operation and maintenance of facilities, and greater fiscal responsibility \nfor  the  participating  local  governments.  The  Project  has  three  components:  (i)  basic  urban \ninfrastructure and service delivery (water supply, sanitation, solid waste management, drainage, \nmunicipal roads and communications, municipal facilities, and basic urban services to the urban \npoor), (ii) governance improvement and capacity development, and (iii) project management and \npourashava support.  \n \n2.  The project investment program is designed to minimize land acquisition and resettlement \nimpacts.  Pourashavas  will  (i)  utilize  existing  lands  for  rehabilitating  existing  water  supply, \ndrainage, and municipal facilities, as well as for providing basic urban services to the urban poor; \n(ii) utilize vacant pourashava or community land and ensure community consensus in the siting of \npublic and community toilets and deep tube wells; (iii) align roads and bridges to avoid impacts on \nstructures; and (iv) utilize vacant pourashava land for solid waste management that will not pose \nhealth hazards to settlements. Impacts are to be further minimized through careful subproject \nsiting and alignment during detailed subproject design and implementation. Short resettlement \nplans were prepared for sample subprojects with resettlement impacts in two pourashavas.1 \n \nB.  Resettlement Framework and Policy \n \n3.  This summary provides highlights of the resettlement framework. The framework outlines \nthe objectives, policy principles, and procedures for land acquisition (if required), compensation, \nand other assistance measures for affected people. It is based on the national law Acquisition and \nRequisition of Immovable Property Ordinance (1982) and the Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The framework provides a comparison of these \ndocuments and addresses gaps.  \n \n4.  The core principles of involuntary resettlement for the Project are as follows: \n(i)  The acquisition of land, in particular land under disputes over ownership, and the \nresettlement of people will be avoided as much as possible. \n(ii)  Local  stakeholders  will  be  systematically  informed  and  properly  consulted  to \nidentify possible alternative subproject engineering and operational solutions to \navoid or minimize the adverse impacts of land acquisition. Disclosure to the public \nregarding the preparation of resettlement plans, the eligibility of affected people, \ncompensation, entitlements, and special assistance measures to vulnerable groups \nwill be undertaken. \n(iii)  All affected people will be properly identified and recorded in a census instrument, \nin which the cut-off date for their eligibility is the last day of the survey in the \nsubproject area, and will be notified in advance when land for the subproject will be \nacquired. Lack of formal legal rights to the assets lost will not prevent affected \npeople from receiving compensation, entitlement, and rehabilitation measures. \n(iv)  Where resettlement cannot be avoided, relocation site(s), whether permanent or \ntemporary, should be free of environmental risks and with access to drinking water \nand sanitation. Social services and all other services accessible in the previous \nlocation will be provided prior to relocation, in consultation with affected people and \ntheir hosts. \n(v)  Relocated affected people will be provided with assistance to maintain, or improve \ntheir  pre-subproject  living  standards,  income  earning  capacity,  and  production \nlevels. \n                                                 \n1  The sample subprojects are for a bus terminal and road improvement in Bhanga Pourashava and road improvement \nin Cox\u2019s Bazar. \n ", "54  Appendix 15 \n \n(vi)  Special  assistance  will  be  incorporated  into  the  resettlement  implementation \nprocess  to  protect  any  socially  or  economically  vulnerable  groups  that  are \naffected.2 \n(vii)  An  effective  mechanism  for  arbitration  of  complaints  and  grievances  will  be \nprovided during resettlement implementation. \n(viii)  Institutional arrangements and human resources will be in place for consultation, \nliaison,  land  acquisition,  resettlement  and  monitoring  to  ensure  effective \nresettlement implementation prior to the commencement of the subproject. \n(ix)  Payment  of  compensation  must  be  provided  prior  to  displacement,  and  other \nresettlement assistance must be initiated prior to award of civil works contracts.  \nThe entitlement matrix for the Project, based on these, is given in Table A15.1 (see page \n57). \n \n5.  Compensation  for  the  loss  of  land,  structures,  assets,  trees,  and  crops  will  be  at \nreplacement cost. Independent land appraisers will determine land prices. Structures and other \nassets  will  be  assessed  by  contracted  implementing  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs) \nthrough a survey of construction materials. Trees and crops will be assessed by NGOs according \nto a survey of market prices and in consultation with agriculture and/or horticulture experts. NGOs \nwill  also  consult  with  affected  people  on  replacement  costs.  Vulnerable  households  will  be \nprovided additional assistance in the form of land-for-land replacement options, prioritized project \nemployment,  and  an  additional  allowance  for  land  and  structure  losses.  Income  losses  are \nanticipated to be minimal and temporary. Income restoration activities include the provision of \nshort-term allowances and restoration of access to livelihood activities. \n \nC.  Procedure for Preparing Resettlement Plans \n \n6.  Resettlement plans for subprojects will be prepared in the following manner. The project \nmanagement office (PMO) will, with guidance from the design, monitoring, and supervision (DMS) \nconsultant,  undertake  socioeconomic  surveys  for  each  subproject  based  on  its  preliminary \ntechnical design. If impacts are found to be significant, full resettlement plans will be prepared for \nthe subproject. 3 If impacts are insignificant, short resettlement plans will be required in subproject \npreparation. Resettlement plans will include measures to ensure that socioeconomic conditions, \nneeds,  and  the  priorities  of  vulnerable  groups  are  identified  and  that  the  process  of  land \nacquisition  and  resettlement  does  not  disadvantage  vulnerable  groups.  DMS  will  have  one \ninternational consultant and seven national consultants familiar with ADB policy and procedures \nfor the preparation of subproject resettlement plans. The plans will comply with Government \npolices,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy,  other  social  safeguard  guidelines,  and  the \nresettlement framework. The resettlement plan for sample subprojects will be used as models for \nthe preparation and implementation of other subproject plans. Approval of subproject resettlement \nplans by ADB, and compensation prior to displacement, will be conditions for civil works contracts. \n \n7.  As the Executing Agency, the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) will, \nthrough the PMO, ensure that the resettlement framework is closely followed when a resettlement \nplan is formulated for a subproject. LGED will further ensure that adequate resettlement budgets \nare delivered on time to the PMO and project implementation units (PIUs) and that NGOs are \ninvolved for timely implementation of resettlement plans. \n \nD.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n8.  A PMO will be established within LGED. The PMO responsibilities include ensuring the \nimplementation  of  resettlement  framework  and  plans.  PIUs  will  be  established  In  each \npourashava and will oversee resettlement concerns related to subproject implementation, with its \n                                                 \n2  These can include ethnic minorities, indigenous peoples, households headed by women or the elderly, and people \nliving below the poverty line. \n3  Resettlement is significant if 200 or more people experience major \u201cimpacts,\u201d defined as affected people being \nphysically displaced from housing and/or losing 10% or more of their productive, income-generating assets. \n ", "       Appendix 15      55 \nresponsibilities including the preparation and updating of resettlement plans consistent with the \nresettlement framework.  \n \n9.  Two fulltime staffers will be recruited in the PMO, one of them to oversee and manage \nsocial issues and social safeguards.  \n \n10.  DMS consultants will be recruited by the PMO to provide assistance to the PMO and PIUs. \nThe  DMS  consultants  include  an  international  resettlement  specialist  (IRS)  and  a  national \nresettlement specialist (NRS) based in the PMO. There will also be six regional resettlement \nspecialists (RRSs). The IRS and NRS will provide technical support to the Environmental and \nSocial  Unit  (ESU),  including  the  review  and  updating  of  the  resettlement  framework  and \nguidelines  for  specific  types  of  subprojects,  and  assist  in  preparing  terms  of  reference  for \nresettlement plan preparation. The RRSs will support resettlement planning functions, including \nupdating subproject resettlement plans, assisting in preparing resettlement plans, and assisting in \nmonitoring subprojects.  \n \n11.  Resettlement issues will be coordinated by the IRS and NRS, who will ensure that all \nsubprojects comply with involuntary resettlement safeguards. The RRSs will work with the PIUs to \nupdate resettlement plans in the detailed design stage and to prepare resettlement plans for new \nsubprojects,  where  required  to  comply  with  Government  and  ADB  policies.  NGOs  will  be \nappointed  to  implement  resettlement  plans.

Consultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n \n12.  The  Project  applies  a  participatory  approach  with  parallel  activities:  stakeholder \nconsultations,  socioeconomic  surveys,  and  initiation  of  PDPs  by  means  of  open,  facilitated \nsessions for ward and pourashava visioning or planning. A wide range of stakeholders had the \nopportunity to make substantive contributions concerning existing conditions and preferences. \nWithin a given community, about 1,200 people have been exposed to the concept of the Project \nby  their  direct  involvement  and  through  citizen\u2019s  groups  and  ward  committees.  Public \nconsultations on social safeguards were held in each of the pourashavas for phase 1 of the \nProject.4 A project brief was prepared for each pourashava that provided an overview of potential \nresettlement impacts and explained proposed entitlement for affected people. Participants came \nfrom  the  communities  directly  affected  by  the  projects,  members  of  ward  committees, \nrepresentatives of local NGOs, and representatives of local government agencies. No significant \nissues were raised during public consultations that have not been addressed in the resettlement \nplans, nor were there issues that pose a significant constraint on the implementation of proposed \nsubprojects. A framework for consultations and community participation has been described in the \nresettlement framework for continuing the process during implementation. All resettlement plans \nand other relevant documents will be made available at public locations in the towns and will be \ndisclosed to a wider audience via the ADB website. \n \n13.  Grievances of affected people will first be brought to the attention of the implementing \nNGO or RRS. Grievances not redressed by the NGO or RRS will be brought to the grievance \nredress committee (GRC). Constituted for each ward, the GRC will comprise representatives from \nthe PIU, implementing NGO, office of the chairman of the pourashava, affected people, and a \nfemale elected member of the Pourashava council. The GRC will meet every month, determine \nthe merit of each grievance, and resolve grievances within 15 days of receiving the complaint. \nThe GRC procedure includes an appeals procedure for the affected person, who can, if not \nsatisfied with the GRC decision, attend the next meeting for reconsideration. Grievances not \nredressed by the GRC will be addressed by the project steering committee or, for grievances \nrelated to land acquisition, by the Office of the District Commissioner. Further grievances will be \nreferred by affected people to the appropriate courts of law. Records will be kept of all grievances \nreceived, including the contact details of complainant, date that the complaint was received, \nnature of grievance, agreed corrective actions, date these were effected, and final outcome. \n \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n14.  Resettlement plan implementation will be closely monitored to provide the PMO with an \neffective  basis  for  assessing  resettlement  progress  and  identifying  potential  difficulties  and \nproblems. Internal monitoring will be undertaken by the PMO with assistance from consultants. \nInternal monitoring will involve monitoring of indicators for (i) budget and time frame; (ii) delivery of \nentitlements; (iii) consultation, grievance, and special issues; and (iv) benefit monitoring. An \nindependent external evaluator will monitor resettlement implementation.  \n \nG.  Resettlement Budget \n \n15.  The PMO will prepare detailed budget estimates for involuntary resettlement for each \nresettlement plan, for inclusion in the overall subproject estimate. The budget will include (i) \ndetailed  costs  of  land  acquisition,  relocation,  and  livelihood  and  income  restoration  or \nimprovement; (ii) the source of funding; (iii) arrangements for approval; and (iv) the flow of funds \nand contingency arrangements. Overall costs are estimated at $1.5 million. All land acquisition \nfunds will be provided by LGED. Land acquisition, compensation, relocation, and rehabilitation of \nincome and livelihood will be considered as an integral component of Project costs. \n                                                 \n4  These were held on 25 November 2008 in Bhanga with 40 participants, 17 December 2007 at Cox\u2019s Bazar with 50 \nparticipants, and 30 December 2008 in Rangpur with 29 participants. Revised safeguards documents with summaries \nin the local language were disclosed in consultations on 1 April in Bhanga with 38 participants, 3 April 2008 in \nRangpur with 39 participants, and 6 April 2008 in Cox\u2019s Bazar with 43 participants. \n ", " \nTable A15.1: Entitlement Matrix \n  Type of    Entitled       \n  Loss  Application  Peoplea  Compensation Policy  Implementation Issues  Responsible Agency \n1a  Loss of land  Homestead  Owners with  \u2022  Land-for-land arrangements of equal  \u2022 If land-for-land is  \u2022 Verification of affected people by \nland,  legal title  productive capacity satisfactory to affected  offered, title will be to  regional resettlement specialists  \nagricultural  person  both husband and  \u2022 Pourashava to provide replacement \nland, or  \u2022  affected person option for cash  wife.  land \nvacant plot  compensation equivalent to replacement  \u2022 Vulnerable  \u2022 Land appraiser to determine \ncost  households to be  replacement value \n\u2022  Provision of stamp duty, land registration  identified during  \u2022 Implementing NGO to consult with \nfee, capital gains tax, and value-added tax  detailed measurement  affected people on compensation \nincurred for replacement land  surveys conducted as  \u2022 LGED to provide budget and \n\u2022  Option to be compensated if remaining land  part of the  release cash compensation \nis no longer viable  resettlement plan  payments \n\u2022  Provision of access to equivalent common  \u2022 Pourashava, with regional \nproperty resources previously accessed  resettlement specialists\u2019 assistance, \n\u2022  Additional compensation for vulnerable  to determine viability of remaining \nhouseholds (item 5)  land \n1b  Loss of land  Homestead  Tenants and  \u2022  Compensation equivalent to 3 months of  \u2022 Landowners will  \u2022 Verification of affected people by \nland,  leaseholders   rental  reimburse tenants and  regional resettlement specialists \nagricultural  \u2022  Additional compensation for vulnerable  leaseholders land  \u2022 Pourashava, with implementing \nland, or  households (item 5)  rental deposit or  NGO, will confirm land rental and \nvacant plot  unexpired lease.  ensure tenants and leaseholders \n\u2022 Vulnerable  receive reimbursement for land \nhouseholds to be  rental deposit or unexpired lease. \nidentified during \ndetailed measurement \nsurveys conducted as \npart of the \nresettlement plan \n1c  Loss of land  Homestead  Sharecroppers   \u2022  60 days advance notice to harvest standing  \u2022 Work schedule to  \u2022 Verification of affected people by \nland,  seasonal crops.
