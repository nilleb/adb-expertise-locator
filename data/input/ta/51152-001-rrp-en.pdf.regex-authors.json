THE PROPOSAL  \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $14,200,000 to Sylvan Agriculture Limited (SAL) for the Second PRAN Agribusiness Project \nin Bangladesh.1 \n \n2.  The project will support SAL\u2019s expansion into potato chips, potato flakes, and pasta \nthrough the financing of new food processing facilities. SAL will procure potatoes under contract \nfarming arrangements and provide secure income to 2,000 smallholder farmers. Given the high \npoverty reduction impact at farming and factory levels, the project will promote inclusive business. \nADB engaged with SAL to achieve effective gender mainstreaming in the project. SAL will commit \nto a gender action plan (GAP), an improvement over ADB\u2019s first financing to SAL which included \nonly one gender target. The project is also fully aligned with the Government of Bangladesh\u2019s \ngoals to enhance agricultural productivity, increase local value addition, and create jobs. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Project identification. Agricultural development is crucial to eradicating poverty and \ncreating conditions for sustainable and equitable growth in Asia, where a large proportion of \npeople still rely on agriculture for their livelihoods. Empirical studies have shown that agricultural \ninvestment is one of the most effective and least-cost strategies to reduce poverty and hunger.2  \n \n4.  Bangladesh remains an agrarian economy, with agriculture providing nearly half of all \nemployment and supporting more than 70% of the population.3 While its share in gross domestic \nproduct dropped to 15% in 2017, agriculture still constitutes the main source of income and food \nsecurity for most Bangladeshis, particularly the poorest.  \n \n5.  Agriculture in Bangladesh is plagued by issues such as being highly unorganized, with \nfragmented landholdings and inefficient value chains. Consequently, value addition in the sector \nremains extremely low\u2014leading to substantial post-harvest losses and a high degree of reliance \non intermediaries for farmers. This is exacerbated by lack of access to good quality inputs, \nfinance, extension services, and other infrastructure on small farms, which leads to low yields. \nThis continues to prohibit farmers from accessing markets. \n \n6.  To increase value addition in the sector, develop commercial agriculture, and connect \nfarmers  to  markets,  private  sector  investment  is  critical.  Formal  value  chains  are  typically \ndeveloped by corporate buyers, who integrate vertically to source directly from the farm gate, to \nsecure long-term access to quality products. Contract farming is one such tool whereby the private \nsector can help farmers obtain access to quality inputs, best agronomic practices, and most \nimportantly provide a direct market linkage, making the value chain more efficient.  \n  \n                                                \n1  The first PRAN Agribusiness Project was approved in 2012 (ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to Sylvan Agriculture Limited for the PRAN Agribusiness Project \nin Bangladesh. Manila). SAL and ADB signed a $25.1 million loan in 2012 and $4.8 million was outstanding as of 30 \nJune 2018.  \n2  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, World Food Programme, and International Fund for \nAgricultural Development. 2012. The State of Food Insecurity in the World. Rome. \n3  ADB. 2016. Country Partnership Strategy: Bangladesh, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n ", "2   \n7.  The PRAN-RFL Group (PRAN), one of Bangladesh\u2019s largest food and agribusiness \ngroups, has been developing farmer engagement through contract farming since the 1990s. \n[Redacted] The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has an existing relationship with the group, with \nan outstanding loan to a group company, SAL (footnote 1). SAL was incorporated in 2012 when \nPRAN wanted to undertake manufacturing of (i) starch and liquid glucose, (ii) flour, and (iii) frozen \nfood products. SAL applied for ADB assistance to finance the construction and operation of three \nnew facilities for these products, although the project scope was later changed to include only \nstarch and liquid glucose. For its starch and liquid glucose production, SAL initiated contract \nfarming with cassava farmers to procure raw material. As of 2018, about 2,500 cassava farmers \nsupply SAL directly for its operations. Given ADB\u2019s association with SAL, PRAN approached ADB \nto finance SAL\u2019s current expansion to pasta production and potato processing, for which SAL will \ncontinue to procure from contract farmers.   \n \n8.  Project design. The project will support the construction of a manufacturing plant and the \npurchase of machinery and equipment to produce potato chips, potato flakes, and pasta. The \nplant will be located in Habiganj Industrial Park, in the north-eastern part of Bangladesh, where \nthe starch and liquid glucose plant is also located. The project will promote inclusive and \nsustainable agricultural value chains with higher local value addition of farm produce. \n \n9.  The project will source potatoes from 2,000 contract farmers. Most of the farmers will be \nfrom the Dinajpur district, in the northern part of Bangladesh. SAL will enable farmers\u2019 access to \na high-yielding and higher-value variety, especially suited for processing,4 helping them to move \nfrom low-income-generating subsistence crops to commercial agriculture (cash crops). SAL has \nabout 20 field staff to advise and train farmers on best agronomic practices and guide them \nthrough the agricultural production process. Farmers also get access to agricultural inputs such \nas fertilizers and pesticides to grow potatoes of good quality.5 SAL will adjust the cost of \nagricultural inputs, which are provided on credit at the time of sowing, against the total amount \npayable. As part of the contract arrangements, SAL will provide a buy-back guarantee based on \nthe market price, providing the farmers with a guaranteed source of income.  \n \n10.  Potato farmers engaged with SAL are expected to benefit from increasing income levels, \nas in the case of cassava farmers. \n \n11.  The project will add value to local farm produce and boost the local agribusiness industry \nwith the new food processing facilities.  \n \n12.  Sponsor. PRAN is one of the largest manufacturing groups in Bangladesh\u2014the market \nleader in food products under the PRAN brand and in plastics under the RFL brand. The late \nAmjad  Khan  Chowdhury  founded  the  group  in  1981  as  a  small  agricultural  equipment \nmanufacturer. It has since evolved into a conglomerate with 34 companies, 13 of which are in the \nfood industry. [Redacted] \n \n13.  PRAN has extensive experience in the food industry.  \n \n14.  PRAN  is  one  of  the  largest  private  employers  in  Bangladesh,  with  some  95,000 \nemployees. Workers receive training and all factories have day-care facilities. Most workers are \n                                                \n4  SAL uses the courage variety of potatoes, which are less prone to infestations and provide a better yield than other \nlocally used varieties such as diamant, cardinal, and granola. \n5  PRAN agricultural staff advises farmers on practices for integrated pest management and encourages the use of \nbiological alternatives to chemical applicants, where possible. \n ", "  3 \nunionized. PRAN engages contract farmers to ensure consistent supply volume and quality and \nto reduce dependence on imports, allowing PRAN food products to have 90% local content. \n \n15.  SAL\u2019s shareholding structure has changed since ADB\u2019s initial financing in 2012 following \nthe demise of its founder, the majority shareholder at the time, in July 2015.  \n \n16.  Integrity due diligence was conducted.6 No significant or potentially significant integrity \nrisks were identified. Tax integrity due diligence was not required. \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Output \n \n17.  Impacts. The project will contribute to at least three of the government\u2019s priorities for the \nagriculture sector in Bangladesh, as stated in the Seventh Five Year Plan, FY2016\u2212FY2020.7 \nThese include (i) facilitating increased private sector investments in agriculture and improving the \nagro-processing value chains; (ii) linking farm produce with the market to overcome the issue of \nlow prices of products at the farm, low investment in agriculture, and inadequate credit support to \nfarmers; and (iii) shifting, where feasible, to higher-value crops for commercialization. \n \n18.  The Seventh Five Year Plan stresses the need to build capacity in agriculture to ensure \nremunerative prices for produce, both to maximize rural income-generating opportunities and to \noptimize the use of limited natural resources. The plan also calls for small and marginal farmers \nto be supported in selling their products by developing linkages with domestic and international \nmarkets. The project achieves this impact through its contract farming feature, which will ensure \nthat farmers are offered ready market access toward a stable income opportunity. \n \n19.  Outcome. The project\u2019s outcome will be the increased production of potato chips, potato \nflakes, and pasta, leading to improved rural livelihoods. The project will effectively promote \ninclusive growth, as potatoes will be directly sourced from 2,000 contract farmers. It will also \ncreate direct employment for about 450 people, at least 50% of whom will be female. New factory \nworkers will benefit from well-paid jobs, as in existing SAL facilities.8  \n \n20.  Output. The project\u2019s output will be the food processing plant completed and operational. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations   \n \n21.  Consistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  Strategy  2030  identified \npromoting rural development and food security by supporting agriculture (improving value chain \nlinkages; and increasing agricultural productivity, food security, and food safety) as one of the key \noperational  priorities  linking  ADB  operations  to  inclusive  growth.9 The  proposed  project  is \nconsistent with this strategy as it (i) supports the development of agricultural value chains \nconnecting  agricultural  production  to  food  processing;  and  (ii) increases  productivity  by \nintroducing new higher-yielding crop varieties, which lead to increased incomes for farmers. \nStrategy 2030 also calls for support to inclusive business models. The project will provide \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2003. Enhancing the Asian Development Bank's Role in Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism.

This compares with a minimum salary of $18 per month for \nsectors not covered by industry-specific minimum wages, and $63 per month in the garment industry (footnote 11). \n9  ADB. 2018.

Therefore, the project is classified as inclusive business (para. 31).  \n \n22.  The country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for Bangladesh identified improving rural \nlivelihoods by increasing the productivity of agriculture as among the priority investment areas for \nprojects since agriculture provides nearly half of all employment and supports more than 70% of \nthe population (footnote 2). It also stated that ADB will continue to provide financial assistance to \nprivate sector projects with sound fundamentals and strong development impact. \n \n23.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project is aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources as it supports agribusiness \ninvestment and value chain development including production, processing, distribution, and \nconsumption.10 The plan states that investments in agriculture and natural resources are essential \nto promoting inclusive growth, reducing poverty, and promoting environmental stability. It also \nmentions that the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) will continue to be among those \nentities responsible for implementing the plan. The project has met the key elements for PSOD \ninvestments as identified in the plan, which are strong sponsors from a credit perspective and \nbest practices for implementation. The project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s sovereign operations \nin Bangladesh. The ADB South Asia Department has a proposed pipeline project of $100 million \nin 2020 for a water project with an agricultural value chain component to assist farmers to \nstrengthen production. To prepare this project, a transaction technical assistance (TA) project in \n2019 will explore opportunities to engage agribusinesses using contract farming models (such as \nPRAN) and to invest in related rural infrastructure and post-harvest facilities. \n \nD.

Unique Features \n \n24.  The project is ADB\u2019s first repeat nonsovereign assistance to a borrower in the agribusiness \nspace. Given the high poverty reduction impact at the contract farming and factory levels, as \nvalidated by the independent poverty impact assessment,11 the project is classified as inclusive \nbusiness. The project will create 450 well-paid factory jobs (footnote 8) in the Habiganj district, \nwhere the share of households living below poverty threshold (poverty rate) is 25%. The project \nwill also boost the income of 2,000 contract farmers (para. 10) and provide livelihood opportunities \nto 24,000 temporary laborers in the Dinajpur district, where poverty rate is 38%.12  \n \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2015.

The Assistance \n \n25.  ADB proposes to provide a loan facility of up to $14.2 million to SAL, which will use the \nloan proceeds to finance its expansion into potato processing and pasta production. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n26.  ADB assistance will add value in several fronts: \n(i)  Long-term funding. ADB will provide long-term US dollar funding, which is not \nreadily available in Bangladesh. SAL has access to short- and medium-term local \ncurrency financing from local commercial banks to fund its working capital needs. \nHowever,  capital  expenditure  projects  need  to  be  funded  through  long-term \nfinancing given a longer payback period.  \n(ii)  Safeguard best practices. ADB will promote higher environmental and social \nstandards through compliance with its safeguard policy requirements. Similar to \nthe arrangement for the existing loan, ADB\u2019s proposed assistance to the new \nproject will ensure that these policy requirements are also applied to the new plant. \n(iii)  Gender inclusion. ADB will promote gender equality through a GAP.  \n \nC.  Risks \n \n[Redacted] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n27.  Safeguards. ADB has categorized the investment in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) as follows: environment (category B), involuntary resettlement (category \nC), and indigenous peoples (category C).13  \n \n28.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the \nadverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans. The environmental and social measures and \nthe  institutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  SAL  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts  are  deemed  adequate.  Key  environment  safeguard  issues  during \nconstruction include solid and liquid waste disposal, noise and vibration, and occupational health \nand  safety.  During  operation,  relevant  areas  of  concern  include  air  emissions,  wastewater \ndischarge, solid waste disposal, workers\u2019 health and safety, food quality assurance, and resource \nefficiency and conservation. An external expert prepared an initial environmental examination, \nwhich includes an environmental and social management and monitoring plan. The external \nexpert conducted an environmental and social compliance audit, with a corresponding corrective \naction plan, for the potato chips component. SAL has established a grievance redress mechanism \nto handle project-related grievances. SAL\u2019s institutional capacity and commitment to manage the \nproject\u2019s social and environmental impacts are deemed adequate.  \n \n                                                \n13 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "6   \n29.  The project will not entail physical or economic displacement, as the project land is owned \nby SAL within the Habiganj Industrial Park. The project will not affect any indigenous peoples. \n \n30.  Effective gender mainstreaming. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998), SAL has incorporated measures to promote gender equality in its business.14   \n \n31.  Other social aspects. SAL will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s \nSocial Protection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized \ncore labor standards.15 The client will report regularly to ADB on (i) its and its contractors\u2019 \ncompliance with such laws and (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation \nwith affected people will follow ADB requirements.16 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n32.  SAL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations  \n \n[Redacted] \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n33.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),17 \nADB  will proceed with the  proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of \nBangladesh has no objection to the proposed assistance to SAL. ADB will enter into suitable \nfinance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the \nproposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$14,200,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to Sylvan Agriculture Limited for the Second \nPRAN Agribusiness Project in Bangladesh, with such terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n19 November 2018 \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2012.
