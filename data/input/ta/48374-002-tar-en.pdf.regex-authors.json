The  transaction  TA  facility  will  provide  capacity  building,  project  preparation  and \nimplementation support, and knowledge sharing to help improve Sri Lanka\u2019s portfolio performance. \nThe TA facility will improve the readiness of pipeline projects and support the implementation of \nongoing projects1  through: (i) demand driven and tailored capacity development programs on \nproject design, implementation, evaluation, cross cutting thematic areas, and procurement; (ii) \nstructured  annual  portfolio  reviews;  and  (iii)  documenting  lessons  learned  and  developing \nknowledge products related to project management for sharing and cross learning among sectors \nand the region. These will ensure project readiness and quality at entry of pipeline projects and \nsound  implementation  performance  of  ongoing  projects.  ADB  supports  the  government\u2019s \napproach of maximizing utilization of existing government workforce. However, if such capacity is \nnot  available,  the  TA  facility  will  prioritize  mobilization  of  national  experts.  Mobilization  of \ninternational experts will be considered if national experts are not available. The TA facility, \nalthough not included in Sri Lanka\u2019s Country Operations Business Plan (2020-2022),2 was \nrequested by the Government of Sri Lanka on 25 September 2020 to support government efforts \nin minimizing delays in projects. The Department of External Resources, Ministry of Finance, \nthrough  its  letter  dated  7  October  2020,  confirmed  the  purpose,  scope,  implementation \narrangements, costs, and financing arrangements of the TA facility.  \n \n2.  Portfolio Growth, Performance, and Issues:  The portfolio in Sri Lanka has grown from \n$2.9 billion in 20153 to $4.1 billion as of 30 September 2020, with approvals and commitments \nincreasing continuously since 2015.4 Over the past five years, the average annual contract \nawards is $442 million while the average disbursements is $362 million. With the increase in \nannual commitments, disbursement ratios have shown a slight decline,5 partly due to inclusion of \nnew sectors where the executing and implementing agencies have little or no prior experience in \nimplementing ADB projects. \n \n3.  As Sri Lanka gained upper middle-income status, its portfolio has diversified to respond \nto the changing needs of the country. In the energy sector, the focus has shifted from electricity \ntransmission and distribution to investments in renewable energy, generation, strengthening \ntransmission stability, and reliability. The transport sector includes port infrastructure development, \nroad safety and road asset management. Interventions in the education sector, which focused on \ndevelopment of the skills sector and vocational training is now targeted to strengthening higher \neducation. The public sector management has to move to finance sector with a focus on support \n \n1 Ongoing projects include: MFF 0086: Integrated Road Investment Program; MFF 0102: Second Integrated Road \nInvestment Program; L3431: Local Government Enhancement Sector Project; L3716: SASEC Port Access Elevated \nHighway Project; L3146/3147/3483/3484: Green Power Development and Energy Efficiency Improvement Investment \nProgram \u2013 Tranche 1 and 2; L3267/3268/3625/3626: Mahaweli Water Security Investment Program \u2013 Tranche 1 and \n2. The TRTA will also support ensuing projects in the sectors of: (i) energy; (ii) agriculture and natural resources; (iii) \neducation and health; (iv) public sector management and finance; (v) transport; and, (vi) urban, water supply and \nsanitation. \n2 ADB.2020.Country Operations Business Plan: Sri Lanka, 2021-2023.Manila. includes this TA under the 2020 pipeline. \n3 Net amount as of 31 December 2015. \n4 In 2015, approvals were $478 million, and commitments were $347 million while in 2017, approvals were $881.3 \nmillion, and commitments were $503.3 million.  This was the highest approvals and commitments for the past five \nyears. Between 2015 and 2019, the average approvals is $617 million and average commitments is $523 million.  \n5 Disbursement ratios on commitment basis for the past five years: 2015-22%; 2016-24%; 2017-20%; 2018-23% and \n2019-20%. \n ", "2   \nfor small and medium enterprise development. Further, interventions in the health and agriculture \nsectors are now shifting focus to face challenges due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) \npandemic.   \n \n4.  To sustain the existing portfolio performance and strengthen performance of new sectors \nand  thematic  areas,  capacities,  and  systems  of  executing  and  implementing  agencies  in \ndesigning and implementing projects need to be strengthened. For the past few years,  project \nperformance is often affected by  (i) lack of counterpart fund and foreign fund allocation; (ii) low \nproject readiness of pipeline projects resulting in startup delays which impact costs and timelines; \nand (iii) poor capacity of executing  and implementing agencies in procurement, consultant \nrecruitment,  construction  management,  contract  administration,  financial  management, \nsafeguards, gender, and monitoring and evaluation.  Projects also experience high turnover of \nkey  project  staff  which  requires  repeat  training  programs  to  build  and  retain  institutional \nknowledge. Low participation of good quality contractors and consultants in procurement process \nand poor performance during implementation are other factors that impede implementation. Due \nto these factors, project implementation is impacted in terms of time, cost, quality, and its \noutcomes. It is important to build on lessons learned from the implementation experience of \nprojects to improve the design of new projects and implementation of ongoing projects. Further, \nexposing project staff to thematic topics would facilitate adoption of modern project management \npractices, innovative approaches, and technologies. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s support: In December 2014, ADB approved the technical assistance TA 8798-\nSRI: Improving Project Readiness and Portfolio Management that has supported 37 training \nprograms (Appendix 1) covering procurement, contract management, financial management, \nsafeguards, gender and negotiation skills for executing and implementing agency staff and other \nagencies such as the National Audit Office and Attorney General\u2019s Office. In addition, the TA has \nfinanced  contracts  of  46  consultants  to  support  activities  related  to  safeguards,  project \nmanagement, contract management, procurement, financial analysis, economic analysis, impact \nassessment and project readiness.  Apart from these activities, the TA has also supported five \nannual tri-partite portfolio review meetings and four sector review meetings from 2015 to 2019. \nThese review meetings provided a venue to discuss project specific and overall portfolio related \nconcerns with high level officials of the executing agencies and the Ministry of Finance. Activities \nsupported under TA 8798 assisted the executing and implementing agencies6 to enhance their \nknowledge, support project management and improve project readiness, project performance and \noverall portfolio performance. The TA is closing in December 2020 and therefore, it is necessary \nto continue these interventions to sustain and improve portfolio performance. \n \n6.  Through TA 8798, experts in safeguards, legal and contracts were mobilized on long \nduration intermittent assignments, which enabled SLRM to quickly respond to government\u2019s \nrequests on project implementation related issues. Quick mobilization of consultants to resolve \nproject issues was one of the good features of this TA as consultant recruitment normally takes \nnearly a month. This approach was very effective and SLRM had addressed project issues on \ntime. Furthermore, as operations moved to a virtual platform during the COVID-19 pandemic, \nADB had supported government-initiated e-procurement platform through this TA, and recruited \nFIDIC experts to respond to contractual issues faced. Building on the lessons learned, the \nproposed TA will continue to provide similar support and will introduce the preparation of an \nannual training plan which will facilitate mainstreaming of training requirements for executing \nagencies and ensure that new trainings are reflected to address new issues rather than rigidly \n \n6 Road Development Authority, Sri Lanka Railway, National Water Supply & Drainage Board, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, \nColombo Municipal Council, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education and Department of Project Monitoring. \n ", "3 \nfollowing a standard pre-determined training schedule. This TA intends to also strengthen and  \nconsolidate the systems of portfolio management and capacity building for the country with annual \ntraining programming based on training needs, capacity monitoring, training materials upgraded \nwith new policies and guidelines and advanced project cycle management-related knowledge \nbase, etc. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Project implementation capacity strengthened. Through training programs, \nknowledge sharing, and focused support in specific areas across all sectors, the TA facility will \nstrengthen project implementation.  Around 35 capacity building programs (Appendix 2) for 600 \nstaff  from  executing  and  implementing  agencies  of  ongoing  and  pipeline  projects  will  be \nundertaken. In addition, training and awareness programs will be supported for partner institutions \nand agencies associated with the implementation and monitoring of ADB portfolio, such as the \nDepartment  of  External  Resources,  National  Audit  Office,  Attorney  Generals  Department, \nDepartment  of  Project  Monitoring  and  Management,  Central  Environment  Authority,  Coast \nConservation Department, Provincial and Local Authorities.  Following a needs assessment, the \ntraining will focus on ADB policies and procedures (on safeguards, gender, procurement, financial \nmanagement, disbursements, lending modalities, project evaluation), project implementation, \nregulatory requirements, governance, construction management, contract disputes resolution & \ncontract management, results based management, and related technical subjects. ADB staff, \nexternal resource persons and training institutes will be identified as resource persons to deliver \nthe training aligned to best international practices. The annual training plan will be developed as \nstated in paragraph 6 to ensure capacity monitoring of the EAs are strengthened, training \nmaterials are upgraded with latest policies and guidelines. Apart from regular training programs, \nthe output will support on site clinics and help desks such as on FIDIC contract management and \ncomplaint management. The consultancy support will also be made available to executing and \nimplementing agencies, and partner institutions and agencies associated with the implementation \nand monitoring of ADB portfolio to provide technical support, as and when required. Specific \nrequirements currently identified include expertise in FIDIC for contract disputes resolution & \ncontract management, income restoration, resettlement planning, engineering disciplines and \nproject implementation.  This output will also support procurement of software packages on \nengineering  design,  database  management,  project  management,  asset  management  and \naccounting to improve work efficiency and facilitate on the job training. \n \n8.  Output 2: Project readiness improved. The project readiness actions jointly agreed \nbetween the Department of External Resources and ADB is intended to minimize startup delays \nand improve project performance. The TA will supplement processing mission team leaders\u2019 \nefforts to  support the executing and implementing agencies of pipeline projects to build capacity \nand undertake due diligence in technical, economic, financial, safeguards and cross cutting \nthemes. It will also support the executing and implementing agencies in preparing communication \nand awareness activities, bidding documents and evaluation to enable advanced procurement. \nThis output will also support procurement of software packages similar with Output 1.  \n \n9.  Output 3: Portfolio monitoring, cross learning and evaluation strengthened. To \nsupport portfolio monitoring, the TA facility will organize and finance regular tripartite portfolio \nreviews and sector reviews. Knowledge sharing and cross learning among agencies and sectors \nwill also be supported through preparation and printing of knowledge products to be disseminated \nwidely;  documenting  lessons  learned  to  improve  project  design  and  implementation;  and \norganizing high level sector forums. This output will also support evaluation of ongoing and \n ", "4   \ncompleted projects, including post project surveys and field studies through engagement of \nservice providers. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n10.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $1,580,000 of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-Other  sources).  The  key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 3.  \n \n11.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office supplies, support \nstaff  and  other  in-kind contributions  which  will  constitute  5%  of the total  TA  amount.  The \ngovernment was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing \nproject. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The executing agency of the TA facility will be the Department of External Resources \n(ERD), Ministry of Finance, Government of Sri Lanka. ADB, through the Sri Lanka Resident \nMission, will administer the TA facility. The TA facility will finance individual consultants, training \nprograms, service providers, workshops, and related logistic arrangements.  When recruiting non-\nADB resource persons and individual consultants, SLRM will seek no-objection from relevant \ngovernment agencies. The TA will also finance the travel cost of ADB and non-ADB resource \npersons attending training programs.  \n \n13.
