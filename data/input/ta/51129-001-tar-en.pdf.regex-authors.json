THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The Government of Armenia is committed to developing comprehensive policy reforms in \nthe education and health sectors. These reforms will enable the government to improve the \nefficient utilization of resources and quality of services in these two social sectors. Support for \nthese social sectors is consistent with the strategic focus of the country partnership strategy, \n2014\u20132018 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Armenia.1  \n \n2.  The government has asked ADB to provide support through the policy-based lending (PBL) \nmodality, which will include two subprograms to tackle development challenges in the education \nand health sectors. Dialogue with the government on reform is substantially advanced with regard \nto education, but at an early stage for health. Thus, the first subprogram will focus mainly on \neducation sector policy reform and include initial support for policy reform in the health sector, \nwhile the second subprogram will increase support for health sector reform. The ensuing project \nand  the  transaction  technical  assistance  (TRTA)  are  currently  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country \noperations business plan, 2018\u20132020, for Armenia.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n3.  The TRTA is justified given the wide-ranging nature of the activities supported by the \nArmenia Social Sector Reform Program, the innovative nature of key aspects of the PBL, and the \nspecialist  nature  of  the  skills  required  in  areas  such  as  the  expansion  of  the  education \nmanagement and information system (EMIS), development of teacher standards, health facility \nmaster planning for integrated care, and review of medical curricula. The TRTA will provide \ntechnical inputs and assessments to help the government and ADB develop PBL that is aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Armenia, the Armenia Development \nStrategy for 2014\u20132025, and the Perspective Development Strategic Program 2014\u20132025. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n4.  The TRTA has the following outputs: \n \n(i)  Assessment of the State Program of Education Development 2017\u20132025, and \nthe  provision  of  technical  support  for  implementation  planning.  The \nassessment  will  focus  on  formulating  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term  reform \npriorities  and  rationalization  plans,  and  a  related  set  of  progress  indicators. \nEmphasis will be placed on priorities and activities that are necessary to improve the \nquality and labor-market relevance of students\u2019 educational outcomes and skills, \npursue  institutional  reforms  and  better  coordination,  and  improve  sustainable \nfinancing and efficient resource allocation in the sector.  \n(ii)  Support  for  the  planned  expansion  of  the  education  management  and \ninformation system, to cover all levels of education. The support will help \nimprove the functions of the current EMIS and develop a set of comprehensive \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

Country Operations Business Plan: Armenia, 2018\u20132020. Manila. A TRTA will \nsupport the government with reform program design work and implementation. \n ", "2 \n \nindicators to support evidence-based, timely policy formulation and implementation \nin the sector effectively.  \n(iii)  Support for the development of national teacher standards, modern teacher \ntraining programs, and professional development programs for educational \nleaders. This output will focus on the development of comprehensive national \nteacher  training  standards  and  programs  that  align  pre-service  and  in-service \nteacher training in basic and secondary education, and professional development \nprograms for school principals and leaders of educational institutions to improve \ngovernance, management, and capacity for resource planning at these levels. The \nsupport t will help develop pathways for career progression and related incentives in \nthe sector, and link them with standards and training. \n(iv)  Assessment of public financial management systems in the social sectors. \nThis output will focus on budget design, execution, funds allocation, key financing \nfunctions such as purchasing, and opportunities to integrate financing for vertical \nprograms.  The  assessment  will  include  an  analysis  of  the  formal  planning, \nbudgeting, and execution system to describe how these funds flow through different \nadministrative levels, and the implementation of these budgets. This description will \ndocument as much as possible the cost of an inefficient public financial management \nsystem in education and health. \n(v)  Assessment of the optimization of primary health care and hospitals through \nan integrated health care model. This output will support the Ministry of Health in \ntransitioning toward more efficient health service delivery through integrated care.2 \nTo assess this, it is necessary to review the current governance, management, and \norganizational structure; services; and rules, responsibilities, and accountability for \ndecision-making.  The  roles  and  independence  of  primary  health  centers  and \nhospitals should be clearly defined within the lines of accountability to the central \nstructure, as well as the need to coexist and support the government\u2019s strategic \ndirection. \n(vi)  Assessment of the medical education system and programs. This assessment \nwill examine the current medical education system, including continuous medical \neducation, and its effectiveness in teaching practical clinical skills. It will look at the \nexisting curricula and syllabi of medical programs, as well as courses and modules \nfor continuous medical education, and will recommend improvements to the current \nsystem, focusing on quality improvement and teaching facilities. \n5.

Cost and Financing \n6.  The technical assistance is estimated to cost $800,000, which will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). The government will provide \ncounterpart support through counterpart staff, provision of office space, communication facilities \nfor consultants, and other in-kind contributions. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n1. The government was informed that approval of the TRTA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing PBL. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n7.  ADB will administer the TRTA. The Ministry of Education and Science and Ministry of \nHealth will be the executing agencies. The Social Sector Division of the Central and West Asia \nDepartment will coordinate the preparation of the PBL with the Ministry of Education and Science \nand Ministry of Health.
