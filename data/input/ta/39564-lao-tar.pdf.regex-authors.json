During the 2006 Country Programming Mission, the Government of the Lao People's \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \nproject preparatory technical assistance (TA) to prepare the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) \nLouangphrabang  Airport  Improvement  Project.  In  August  2006,  an  ADB  mission1 visited \nLouangphrabang Airport in Lao PDR. The TA is included in ADB's regional cooperation strategy \nand program update (2006\u20132008).2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Lao PDR is located between Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China, Myanmar, \nThailand, and Viet Nam. Two thirds of its land area is covered by forest and woodland, and its \npopulation is estimated at 5.6 million. Improved transport facilities are crucial for the landlocked \nand mountainous country. In the absence of a railway system and access to the sea, Lao PDR \ndepends heavily on road transport followed by civil aviation. Development of civil aviation \ntransport infrastructure is crucial to promoting national, regional, and international tourism. \n \n3.  The Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) within the Ministry of Communication, Transport, \nPost and Construction (MCTPC) is responsible for policy and planning in civil aviation and for \nregulatory oversight of technical and safety matters pertaining to Lao Airlines and the Lao \nAirports Authority (LAA). DCA has eight divisions plus LAA. Under a decree of the Prime \nMinister, DCA governs the civil aviation sector. The Civil Aviation Master Plan for 1991\u20132000 \nwas  prepared  by  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  and  the  International  Civil \nAviation Organization (ICAO). It was later reviewed and twice updated under ADB funding.  \n \n4.  LAA  has  eight  sections  and  is  responsible  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of \nVientiane\u2019s Wattay International Airport, two regional airports (at Louangphrabang and Pakse), \nand two provincial airports (at Luang Namtha and Savannakhet). All other small airports are the \nresponsibility of the provincial governments with DCA providing technical consultation. The \nnational airline, Lao Airlines, a state-owned company, provides international services and is the \nsole operator on all domestic routes. Other international services to the Lao PDR are operated \nprimarily by Bangkok Airways, Thai Airways, and Vietnam Airlines.  \n \n5.  The tourism sector constitutes one of the 11 flagship programs in the 10-year strategic \nframework of the Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program. This recognizes \nthe important contribution that tourism could make to socioeconomic development (especially \npoverty  reduction)  and  conservation  of  natural  and  cultural  heritage  resources.  Current \nforecasts suggest that growing connectivity, development, and awareness of the subregion as a \nglobal destination could increase total international tourism arrivals to the subregion from 14.6 \nmillion in 2004 to between 46 million and 52 million by 2015. The objectives of the GMS \nprogram for the tourism sector are to develop and promote the Mekong region as a single \ndestination by offering a diversity of good quality and high-yielding subregional products that \nhelp to distribute the benefits of tourism more widely; add to the tourism development efforts of \neach GMS country; and contribute to poverty reduction, gender equality, empowerment of \nwomen, and sustainable development while minimizing adverse impacts. \n \n                                                 \n1  The visit was part of the Interim Review Mission for TA 4742-LAO (ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Northern Greater Mekong Subregion Transport Network Improvement \nProject. Manila). \n2  ADB. 2005. Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): Greater Mekong Subregion. Manila. \n ", "2   \n6.  Tourism is an important and growing component of the Lao PDR economy. Tourist \narrivals have increased at an average annual rate of 45% since 1990 to more than 1 million in \n2005. Revenues from tourism amount to an estimated $100 million (4% of 2005 GDP) per year. \nMore than two thirds of tourists come from other GMS countries. About 55% of the tourists are \nfrom Thailand; 15% from Viet Nam; about 4% each from the United States and People\u2019s \nRepublic of China; and 3% from France. There is substantial potential for continued increases in \ntourism. Tourism arrivals in the Lao PDR are only 28% of Cambodia\u2019s, 2% of Thailand\u2019s, and \n11% of Viet Nam\u2019s. \n \n7.  Louangphrabang city is the historical former royal capital of Laos and was designated a \nWorld  Heritage  Site  in  1995  by  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural \nOrganization. Located on the east bank of the Mekong River and at the mouth of the Nam Khan \nRiver,  the  site  contains  the  former  royal  palace  and  more  than  50  temples.  It  is  rapidly \ndeveloping into a popular tourist destination. The city can be reached by land, by river, or by air \nthrough Louangphrabang Airport (LPA).  \n \n8.  LPA was constructed in 1972 and is within 2 kilometers of the historic city center. It is the \nsecond busiest airport in Lao PDR, after Vientiane\u2019s Wattay International Airport. It currently \nserves as a regional airport with scheduled international flights to Bangkok, Chiangmai, and \nSiem Reap. It also is a major domestic hub for the northern cities in Lao PDR, with scheduled \nconnections to Houeixai, Phongsaly, Vientiane, and Xieng Khouang. Passenger traffic at the \nairport has been increasing steadily in recent years. In 2004, the airport\u2019s reported passenger \ntraffic was 143,111, of which approximately 38% were international passengers. At present, \nflight paths for most aircraft landings and takeoffs at LPA pass over the World Heritage Site, \nwhich is located to the southwest of LPA. However, realignment of the runway could minimize \nany potential negative impacts from aircraft noise and emissions. Realignment of the runway \nwould also enable shifting of the most frequently used flight paths so that they no longer pass \ndirectly over the heritage site. \n \n9.  LAA is responsible for (i) providing the aeronautical and air traffic service to LPA, (ii) \nproviding maintenance services to the airport to ensure the facilities are in a safe and good \noperating condition, (iii) providing personnel to manage day-to-day airport operations, and (iv) \ncollecting service charges from airport users and tenants on behalf of the Government. The \nLouangphrabang provincial government is fully responsible for managing and developing the \nLPA infrastructure and facilities, as well as for providing LPA with adequate capacity to cope \nwith the growing traffic demand and, thereby, to support the socioeconomic development of the \nprovince. A private sector company is responsible for management and operation of the existing \npassenger  terminal  compound  at  LPA  under  a  concessionaire  lease  contract  with \nLouangphrabang\u2019s provincial government. That contract will expire in December 2018. \n \n10.  A preliminary assessment for upgrading LPA was conducted under ADB TA 3968-LAO: \nNorthern  Airports  Improvement  Project.3 The  assessment  found  that  although  the  existing \nrunway is able to accommodate the increasing air traffic demand, the terminal capacity and \naircraft parking apron are acutely short of capacity to support passenger operations during peak \noperating hours. However, the assessment also found that the airport\u2019s more critical constraints \nare not related to traffic capacity but relate to operational safety compliance due to constraints \nof the original design. \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Preparing the Northern Airports \nImprovement Project. Manila. \n ", "  3\n11.  With LPA\u2019s new 2,200 x 45 meter runway and installation of navigational aids  for \ninstrument landing systems, the Government is very interested in further upgrading the runway \nto an ICAO Code 4C Category I precision-instrument runway and also to make other airport \ninfrastructure modifications to support the operation of B737 and A320 aircraft in the near future. \nThese aircraft types are used by regional airlines to service the other major tourism destinations \nin  the  GMS.  The  airport  does  not  meet  the  requirements  of  an  ICAO  Code  4  precision-\ninstrument runway primarily because obstacle clearance requirements for precision-instrument \nrunways are not met. The existing aircraft parking apron, air traffic control tower, terminal \nbuilding,  and  some  ancillary  airport  buildings  are  either  located  within  the  runway  strip  or \nencroach into the transitional surfaces of the precision-instrument runway. \n \n12.  The existing fire station facility is also not able to support the operation of B737 and \nA320 aircraft. The terminal building and control tower are modern but are too small to handle \nthe future passenger traffic should B737 or A320 aircraft be served. The existing aircraft apron \nis not able to accommodate the parking of multiple B737 or A320 aircraft. The terminal lacks the \nability to segregate domestic and international passengers. Also, airport security, including \nairport fencing, does not comply with international standards.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The outcome of the proposed TA is a feasibility study for improvement of LPA and a \nproject suitable for financing. The impact of the ensuing project will be increased tourism and \neconomic growth in the project area. The improvement of LPA will facilitate tourism by enabling \nairlines to use the same type of aircraft at Louangphrabang, one of Lao PDR\u2019s primary tourism \ndestinations, as are used for other tourism destinations in the GMS. This will enable Lao PDR to \nparticipate fully in the growth of tourism in the GMS. The project will also facilitate increased \nprivate sector participation in civil aviation in Lao PDR. The TA will examine potential options for \nprivate  sector  involvement  in  the  project,  including  financing  and  subsequent  operations. \nPrivate sector involvement in the improvement of LPA could serve as a catalyst for additional \nprivate sector involvement in the aviation sector and contribute to an improved investment \nclimate in general. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  To prepare the ensuing project, the TA will include (i) preparing a traffic forecast for LPA; \n(ii) preparing the preliminary design and cost estimates for the preferred option for meeting the \ntraffic forecast; (iii) examining possible institutional arrangements for implementing the project, \nincluding various forms of private sector involvement; (iv) a financial analysis, including an \nanalysis of possible sources of private and public sector financing; (v) an economic analysis of \nthe proposed option, including impact of increased tourism and subregional transport and \ncooperation; and (vi) analysis of the environmental and social impacts of the project, including \nresettlement effects, poverty analysis, and impacts on historical and cultural sites. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $710,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $600,000 \nequivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment of Lao PDR will finance the balance of the cost equivalent of $110,000 by providing \nrequired office accommodation and services, local communications, remuneration and per diem \n ", "4   \nfor counterpart staff, and other items, mostly in kind. The Government has been advised that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The cost estimates for \nthe TA are shown in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The DCA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. It has the capacity to handle the TA \nsuccessfully, given its prior experience with ADB projects. DCA\u2019s director general will be \nresponsible for overall coordination among relevant ministries and agencies, consultants, and \nADB, including extensive consultations with stakeholders and nongovernment organizations. \nThe Government will set up a steering committee to oversee and coordinate all activities for \ncarrying out the TA. The steering committee will be chaired by a vice minister of MCTPC \nand comprise representatives from DCA, MCTPC, Ministry of Finance, the Committee for \nPlanning and Cooperation, National Tourism Authority, and Lao Airlines. The Government will \nmake available a team of counterpart staff consisting of representatives from each division \nwithin DCA to help' the consultants carry out the TA in a timely manner. DCA will provide \noffice  accommodation,  local  communication  facilities,  office  support  staff,  and  other \nadministrative support. \n \n17.  An international consulting firm in association with national consultants will be selected \nand engaged by ADB, using the quality and cost-based selection method. ADB will adhere to its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time) in engaging \nconsultants. The simplified technical proposal procedure will be used to select the consultants. A \ntotal of about 17 person-months of international and 51 person-months of national consulting \nservices  will  be  required.  In  addition,  there  will  be  a  lump-sum  input  of  $20,000  to  cover \nengineering and other surveys to be implemented by the consulting firm. The consultants will have \nextensive  experience  in  (i)  transport  economics,  including  related  financial  management;  (ii) \neconomic and financial evaluation of airport projects, including institutional arrangements and \nprivate sector involvement; (iii) airport engineering; and (iv) environmental, social, and poverty \nimpact assessments, including resettlement. To facilitate the work and ensure that DCA gains \ntechnical  expertise  and  knowledge,  the  consultant  team  will  work  closely  with  counterpart \ntechnical experts from DCA. DCA has agreed to provide the counterpart technical staff to assist \nwith the necessary surveys and other work in a timely manner. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over about 7 months, beginning in April 2007 for completion \nby  October  2007.  The  consultants  will  submit  (i)  an  inception  report  within  1  month  of \ncommencing their services; (ii) an interim report within 3 months; (iii) a draft final report within 6 \nmonths that will include the environmental, social, and poverty impact assessment reports and \nresettlement plans, if necessary; and (iv) a final report within 3 weeks after receipt of comments \nfrom the Government and ADB. The Executing Agency, ADB, and consultants will meet in Lao \nPDR to review and endorse the inception, interim, and draft final reports. The consultants will \nconduct seminars for DCA staff and any other interested government organizations concerning \nthe techniques, analysis, and findings of the TA. Equipment to be provided under the TA will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Office equipment purchased will \nbe transferred to MCTPC upon completion of the TA, and thereafter it will remain property of the \nGovernment.     \n \n \n ", "  5\nIV.
