INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support developing member \ncountries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to improve energy efficiency, mitigate \nthe risks of virus transmission, and ensure safe working conditions in public buildings by deploying \nefficient, clean, and smart centralized air-conditioning (CAC) systems. The TA team will assess \nthe  energy  efficiency  and  virus  transmission  risks  of  CAC  systems;  make  appropriate \nrecommendations; and pilot the operation of smart, energy efficient, and disease resilient CAC \nsystems in selected DMCs.1 \n \n2.  The  TA  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030,  particularly  operational  priority  1 \n(addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities) through its emphasis on addressing \nhuman development and better health for all; operational priority 3 (tackling climate change, \nbuilding  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability);  and \noperational priority 4 (making cities more livable).2 The TA is included in the 2020 Management-\napproved  results-based  work  plan  of  the  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate \nChange Department.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Inefficient air-conditioning systems in public buildings. Air-conditioning is a basic \nservice in many cities of DMCs, accounting for up to 50% of energy consumption in public \nbuildings.  If  advanced  air-conditioning  systems  with  energy-saving  technology  are  used  in \ncombination  with  demand-side management  in buildings,  energy  savings  of 25%\u201345%  are \npossible.4 The low energy efficiency of air-conditioning systems is mainly due to old equipment \nand a lack of proper operation and regular maintenance. CAC systems integrated with smart \ndigital control technology can collect indoor and outdoor air temperature, humidity, air pressure, \nand thermal load readings at different points of the buildings to optimize system efficiency. Such \nsystems automatically adjust the operation parameters to achieve high energy efficiency. Efficient \nCAC systems reduce operational costs and decrease energy consumption, thereby contributing \nto climate change mitigation. ADB has implemented numerous energy efficiency projects, but they \nrarely focus on air-conditioning.  \n \n4.  Airborne transmission of coronavirus disease. The risk of transmitting the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) through CAC systems in public buildings has become a major concern during \nthe pandemic. According to research studies, the virus can survive in the air for several hours in \nfine particles known as aerosols.5 Another study indicated that droplet transmission was prompted \nby  air-conditioned  ventilation. 6  The  American  Society  of  Heating,  Refrigerating  and  Air- \nConditioning Engineers advised that \u201ctransmission of coronavirus through the air is sufficiently \nlikely that airborne exposure to the virus should be controlled. Changes to building operations, \n \n1  Before any TA activity starts in the territory of a participating DMC, ADB will secure a written confirmation from such \nDMC that the government does not object to ADB financing the proposed TA.  \n2  ADB. 2018.

Centralized  air-conditioning  systems  and  indoor  air  hygiene.  CAC  systems \ncommonly use recirculated air (70%), mixed with fresh air (30%) in public buildings. Air filtration \ncomponents of standard CAC systems are not effective in filtering viruses and other pathogens, \ncreating a high risk that recirculated air inside public buildings and other closed spaces can spread \nCOVID-19 and other airborne viruses and bacteria. In many DMCs, this risk is higher because of \npoor hygiene practices, including the use of old air-conditioning equipment, lack of regular \nmaintenance, and overcrowding in closed spaces. Furthermore, government institutions and \noperators of public buildings generally lack the awareness and capacity to deal with these risks. \nCertain basic operational procedures should be followed, including regular maintenance, cleaning, \ndisinfection; adjusting recirculated air ratio; and air filtration. Moreover, the role of CAC systems \nin controlling virus transmission should be part of a broader multimodal infection control strategy \nin public buildings. Therefore, an urgent need exists to build (and/or retrofit) disease resilient and \nenergy efficient CAC systems in both the short term and the long term. \n \n6.  High-efficiency CAC systems have three main indicators: (i) refrigeration effect, (ii) indoor \nair quality, and (iii) energy efficiency. Proper design and operation of CAC systems can prevent \nvirus  transmission  through  advanced  solutions  and  technologies  such  as  high-efficiency \nparticulate filtration, proper humidification, and ultraviolet air purification to reduce airborne \ncontaminants while achieving optimum room temperature and humidity. These technologies can \nbe integrated with smart digital control systems to reduce energy consumption and disease \ntransmission risks associated with operating CAC systems. \n \n7.  Additionally, CACs rely heavily on hydrofluorocarbons, a greenhouse gas potentially \nthousands  of  times  more  potent  than  carbon  dioxide,  for  cooling.  Proper  management  of \nhydrofluorocarbons through restriction and prohibition; development of substitutes; and harmless \ntreatment is critical to addressing greenhouse gas emissions from CACs.9 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: disease resilient clean energy development \nin DMCs promoted. 10 The TA will have the following outcome: deployment of CAC systems that \nmeet energy efficiency and indoor air hygiene needs increased.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output  1:  Knowledge  on  energy  efficiency  and  virus  transmission  risks  of \ncentralized  air-conditioning  systems  in  typical  public  buildings  improved.  Based  on \n \n7  Kerri O\u2019Brien. Ultraviolet lights and HVAC improvements to fight COVID-19. https://www.wric.com/news/taking-\naction/ultraviolet-lights-and-hvac-improvements-to-fight-covid-19/.   \n8  World Health Organization. 9 July 2020.

Geneva.  \n9  The Initiative on Fluorocarbons Life Cycle Management (IFL) was launched at the United Nations Climate Change \nConference (COP25) in Spain in December 2019, initiated by Ministry of Environment of Japan.   \n10 Defined by TA. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "  3 \nliterature review and historic operation data of CAC systems in selected public buildings in DMCs, \nthe TA team will assess indoor air pollution and virus transmission risks as well as energy \nefficiency in public buildings. All assessments will be tailored to the selected pilot public buildings \nin DMCs. Corrective and preventive measures will be formulated based on this risk assessment. \nAn assessment of hydrofluorocarbon life-cycle assessment will also be conducted. Suggestions \nfor energy efficiency, virus transmission risks and greenhouse gas management in CAC systems \nbased on these assessments will be shared with DMCs via the ADB website.  \n \n10.  Output  2:  Innovative  centralized  air-conditioning  systems  using  digital \ntechnologies demonstrated. Three pilots will be installed in public buildings of selected DMCs. \nSelection of DMCs will be based on the epidemic situation, weather conditions, and demand for \nthe  TA  output.  The  pilot  CAC  systems  will  combine  artificial  intelligence  control-enabled \ntechnology and smart components to improve efficiency and promote health objectives. The pilot \nCAC systems will incorporate high-efficiency filtration and ultraviolet sterilization technology12 to \neliminate and prevent the spread of viruses. The pilot projects will be replicable to upgrade or \nconstruct clean and efficient CAC systems in DMCs. This output will also design the operational \nspecifications and procedures for CAC system operation under three different scenarios: during \npandemic, back-to-work, and normal. The TA will analyze how to use digital technology to \nautomatically adjust CAC operating parameters according to the mix of indoor and outdoor \nenvironment parameters; and how to seamlessly switch between the operation modes to balance \nhygiene and energy savings under different scenarios. Recommendations on CAC hygiene \nstandards and a manual for design, operation, and maintenance of CAC systems will be prepared \nand shared with DMCs via the ADB website. \n \n11.  Output  3:  Awareness  on  energy  conservation  and  containing  indoor  virus \ntransmission  enhanced.  Under  this  output,  knowledge  produced  under  the  TA,  including \noperational experience from the pilot projects, will be disseminated via ADB\u2019s website, and \nawareness and capacity to prevent and contain indoor virus transmission through cleaner and \nmore efficient CAC systems will be enhanced. Training workshops, including online trainings and \nwebinars, will be conducted for relevant government institutions;13 operators of public buildings; \nand other public, private and nongovernment organization stakeholders.  \n \nC.
