Key Development Issues to be addressed:  \nThe effective disposal of municipal solid waste (MSW) is a serious environmental and social challenge in the \nPhilippines, especially in urban centers. In Metro Manila alone, of the estimated 6,700 tons of solid waste \ngenerated per day, only approximately 720 tons per day is recycled or composted. The balance\u2014some 6,000 \ntons daily\u2014is either hauled to the city\u2019s dump sites, dumped illegally on private land, in rivers, creeks, Manila \nBay, or openly burned thereby adding to the heavily polluted air shed.1 Metro Manila\u2019s diversion rate2 of 10.75% \nis way below the acceptable ratio of 50%, the target ratio also set in the United States. Leachate from the dump \nsites were tested and found to have levels of contaminants that were far above the maximum allowed in \ndrinking water; most of this leachate seeps untreated into groundwater, a source of drinking water, and runs into \nthe river systems and Manila Bay, a fisheries resource.3 The failure to manage MSW appropriately causes \nserious environmental problems such as air pollution and soil and groundwater contamination. Increasing \nnumbers of migrants from rural areas often live near polluting landfills, making them vulnerable to the air \npollution and soil contamination.  \n \nThe risks to human health are enormous. Solid wastes can come into direct or indirect contact with human \nbeings at several stages in the waste cycle. The groups at risk include: (i) those living in unserved areas, \nespecially pre-school children; (ii) garbage collectors/scavengers; (iii) people living close to waste disposal \nfacilities; and (iv) population whose water supplies have been polluted due to waste dumping or leakage from \nlandfill sites. Waste-linked diseases include chronic respiratory diseases from exposure to dust, bacterial blood \ninfections due to injuries caused by infectious sharp waste, eye and skin infections from waste generated \ninfected dust, vector-borne diseases like dengue, yellow fever and malaria transmitted by vectors living or \nbreeding in waste-generated ponds, and bacterial and parasitic enteric diseases like diarrhea and amoebiasis \ntransmitted by insects/rodents feeding on wastes and through drinking water contaminated by leachate fom \nwaste.4 Therefore, a more integrated approach to developing an efficient, environmentally sustainable, and \nwell-managed MSW system is needed. \n \nThrough its Long Term Sustainability Vision and 2020 Goals, The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G, Sponsor \nof the project) has committed to conduct pilot studies in developing markets to understand how to eliminate \nlandfilled  and dumped consumer solid  waste  and,  at the same time, improve the economic, social  and \nenvironmental sustainability of existing systems. In addition to finding ways to design products and packaging \nout of waste, P&G is exploring how to catalyze development of new integrated waste management systems in \none or more emerging markets by 2020. The Waste-to-Worth (W2W) project (the Project) involves development \nof a profitable and flexible business model/supply chain for the collection and treatment of MSW into valuable \nproducts. The Project is consistent with P&G\u2019s long-term vision of powering its plants with 100% renewable \nenergy and having zero consumer or manufacturing waste going to landfills. This initiative is also part of P&G\u2019s  \nsocial responsibility agenda for investing in solid waste management and waste-to-energy projects as an offset \nto commercial waste produced by P&G products. The Project aims to develop an integrated MSW management \nplan which includes: \n\u2022  Collection of all fractions of MSW from homes and businesses; \n\u2022  Sorting at a Materials Recycling Facility (MRF) by current waste scavengers to separate recyclables; \n\u2022  Conversion of remaining waste using reliable technologies into something with value (e.g. organic \u2018wet\u2019 \nwaste converted to biogas or soil amendments; \u2018dry\u2019 waste converted by thermal treatment into a type \nof energy); \n\u2022  Creation of new markets and solicitation of buyers for the new products (e.g. electricity generated by \nwaste-to-energy plant); and \n\u2022  Enable the community to sustain a safe integrated waste system by involving local and national \nstakeholders, including local government units, industries, non-governmental organizations (NGO) and \nthe residents. \n \n \n                                                \n1 National State of the Brown Environment Report \n2 Diversion Rate is the percentage of waste materials diverted from traditional disposal such as landfilling or \nincineration to be recycled, composted, or re-used. \n3 The Garbage Book \u2013 Solid Waste Management in Metro Manila 2004 \n4 UN Environment Program: Solid Waste Management December 2005  ", "   \n   \n \nP&G selected the Philippines for the first pilot project due to existence of (i) legislation on solid waste \nmanagement,  (ii)  active  national  and  local  solid  waste  associations,  (iii)  potential  commercial  and  NGO \npartners; and (iv) potential funding and commercial incentives for waste collection and treatment systems. The \nexpectation is for the W2W to be sustainable for the entire community in the long-term and to be successfully \nreplicated in other urban centers in the Philippines as well as other countries. \n \nP&G approached ADB for technical assistance funding to add credibility to the Project and encourage other \npotential  stakeholders  like  local  government  units,  local  entrepreneurs,  utilities  and  non-government \norganizations  to  participate.  P&G  also  believes  that  the  Project  will  benefit  from  ADB\u2019s  experience  in \ninfrastructure finance and waste to energy sector. \n \nThe ADB\u2019s technical assistance for the proposed Project is justified by its development impacts. The Project \nsupports the ADB\u2019s operational strategy as well as the government\u2019s national strategy and policy objective for \naddressing the growing problem of MSW. More specifically, the Project will: i) provide access to clean and \nreliable electricity supply, ii) provide a sustainable solution to the growing MSW problem, iii) raise urban living \nstandards  and  advance  sustainable  urban  development,  iv)  arrest  environmental  degradation  which \ndisproportionately  affects the urban poor\u2019s air  and water quality and v) reduce harmful greenhouse gas \nemissions. The proposed PPTA will further incentivize P&G to replicate this in other parts of the \nPhilippines and other countries where it has operations, if proven feasible and cost effective. P&G has \nthe financial muscle to fund projects like this but initially seeks ADB\u2019s support and participation to \nshow a stamp of legitimacy and attract potential stakeholders to participate in the project and ensure \nits sustainability. \n \n \n8.  TA Description:  \na.  Link to Country Partnership Strategy/Regional Cooperation Strategy:  \nLink to ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020  \nThe Project embodies ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which emphasizes more support for environmentally sustainable \ndevelopment and private sector development utilizing clean technologies. ADB will also promote complimentary \nfinancing schemes as well as innovative financial products, if needed, to catalyze funds from other commercial \nsources.  \n \nLink to ADB\u2019s 2009 Energy Policy \nADB seeks to meet energy security, facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy, and achieve ADB\u2019s vision \nof a region free of poverty. ADB also seeks to help developing member countries (DMCs) to provide reliable, \nadequate, and affordable energy supplies for inclusive growth in a socially, economically, and environmentally \nsustainable way. \n \nLink to Philippine Country Partnership Strategy \nOne objective of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the Philippines is to reduce environmental degradation \nand vulnerability to climate change and disasters. To achieve this, ADB will support investment needs to ensure \nsustainable financing of infrastructure and foster development of sustainable communities; ADB assistance \naims to strengthen waste management and flood control systems among others. PSOD, in particular, is in \nsearch of commercially viable solutions and partners who have the financial capacity and are willing to \nexperiment  and  innovate  in  this  area.  The  proposed  PPTA  is  consistent  with  this  objective\u2014improving \nsustainable environmental infrastructure in highly urbanized areas where economic gains can be maximized. It \nwill also incentivize private sector participation in addressing MSW problem. \n \n \nb.  Impact  \nThe impact of the PPTA is the demonstrated viability and sustainability of waste-to-energy projects in the \nPhilippines.  \n \nc.

The 2009 Energy Policy (Policy), congruent with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2020, identifies the promotion of renewable energy, as one of its pillars for implementation. This is consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s overall strategy emphasizing energy security, facilitating a transition to a low-carbon economy, \nuniversal access to energy, and for achieving ADB\u2019s vision of a region free of poverty. \n \nIn support of these thrusts, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Infrastructure Finance Division 2 (PSIF2) will, following \nconsultation with The Procter & Gamble Company (\u201cP&G\u201d or the \u201cSponsor\u201d),  recruit Consulting Firms to \nconduct a project preparation technical assistance (PPTA) to develop the \u201cWaste to Worth Project\u201d in the \nPhilippines.  This  project  will  require  consultant  services  spread  over  24  months  (over  2  fiscal  years) \ncommencing on October 2012. The PPTA will engage and finance a total of 31 person-months (PM) of \nconsulting services (14 PM international and 17 PM national). \n \nThis PPTA will help the Sponsor to determine the viability of constructing two (2) Material and Energy \nRecovery Facilities in the Philippines (The Project). The PPTA will review 2 pilot cities/site locations for the \nProject.  Further, the Consulting Firms will assess the size, optimal siting, technology integration, financial and \neconomic viability, environmental impact, regulatory issues, and recycling options for the Project. The PPTA \nwill also determine the optimal business model for the Project based on cost/benefit analysis that includes fuel \navailability  projections,  capital  investment,  technology  integration  and  potential  Project  expansion.

International; 5 PM) \n \nThe Sponsor has completed an extensive technology evaluation process over the past 15 months \nresulting in selection of three separate technology approaches that would work in concert together: \n \n\u2022  a separation technology vendor (VM Press, Italy) that uses pressure to separate mixed MSW into \n\u201cwet\u201d (largely organic slurry for anaerobic digestion)  and \u201cdry\u201d fractions (a mixture of inorganic and \nfibrous organic materials ideal for thermal processing); \n\u2022  a thermal processing technology (SkygasTM; MPM Technologies, USA)--this approach maximizes \nconversion to electricity using a modified plasma arc approach coupled with extensive emissions \ncontrols through its sister company, Airpol; and  \n\u2022  a more traditional anaerobic digestion technology.
