The knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA) cluster  was  approved  on  15 \nSeptember 2018. The overall TA cluster is estimated at $1.5 million. The TA subproject 1 was \napproved on 15 October 2018, while the TA subprojects 3 and 4 are being processed for approval \nwithin 2018. \n \nB.  Subproject Outcome \n2.   The subproject will have the following outcome: capacity and institutional framework for \nintegrating poverty reduction into eco-compensation policies and programs enhanced. This will \nsupport the outputs of the overall TA cluster and the subproject will be aligned with the following \nimpact: green economic development and ecological protection in the Yangtze River Economic \nBelt achieved.1 The National Development and Reform Commission is committed to undertaking \npolicy research on the impact of ecological conservation and eco-compensation programs to \npoverty reduction and rural welfare objectives. To undertake this policy research, the Western \nRegion Development Department (WRDD) requested the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) \nsupport for the outputs outlined below.  \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs, Methods, and Activities   \n3.  Output  1:  Analysis  of  the  current  experience  of  eco-compensation  and  other \nconservation programs in targeting rural welfare improvement and poverty alleviation \nprepared. This output will prepare (i) a summary of the experience and performance of a \nrepresentative selection of eco-compensation and other conservation program case studies; and \n(ii) a ranking and assessment of the importance of various program design and implementation \nelements on the effectiveness of conservation programs in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nto jointly achieve rural welfare improvement and ecological outcomes. Preliminary case studies \nto capture locations with both high conservation value and poverty alleviation potential include \nselected municipalities in the provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, all of which are within \nboth national key ecological function zones and nationally-designated poverty areas. Case \nstudies will provide detailed descriptions of the program structure, development process, timeline \nand implementation, as well as the socioeconomic, ecological and institutional context of the \nregions and communities targeted.  \n \n4.  Output 2: Policy brief integrating poverty reduction and rural welfare improvement \ngoals with eco-compensation developed. Indicative activities under this output include (i) \ndevelopment of a poverty and high conservation value area \u201cmapping\u201d for the PRC to identify \nregions of high overlap that would be well-suited to joint targeting of poverty alleviation and \nconservation; (ii) a review of the literature summarizing international best practice in program \ndevelopment, design and implementation for effectively achieving both conservation outcomes \nand rural welfare improvement; (iii) an international conference on how poverty alleviation and \nrural welfare improvement can best be linked with conservation targets, with international experts \nsharing their experience and recommendations, and the findings of Output 1 and the poverty-\nenvironment  mapping  preliminary  results  presented,  discussed  and  given  feedback  from \nconference participants; and (iv) preparation of final policy recommendations, based on the \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework of the subproject is in Appendix 1.

Output  3:  Subproject  findings  disseminated  and  shared  with  policymakers. \nIndicative activities under this output include (i) various national workshops targeting government \nofficials administering key ecological function zones, to share a summary of the findings of \nOutputs 1 and 2, and to obtain feedback on these and current challenges faced by these officials \nin managing these zones; (ii) presentation of these findings in selected international workshops \nand conferences, especially those hosted by other ADB member countries; (iii) development of \n2\u20135 brief news items, articles or blogs on the subproject findings, and publishing of these in \nvarious international platforms such as Development Asia; (iv) a study tour in ADB member \ncountries for five key national and provincial government officials to discuss these findings and \nconsult with select international organizations that have expertise in this field, with the goal of \nstrengthening the knowledge and capacity of these government officials to integrate poverty \nreduction with eco-compensation and other conservation programs; and (v) strengthening the \ncapacity of the existing regional knowledge hub to effectively function as a community of practice \nfor mainstreaming poverty reduction into eco-compensation. \n \nD.  Subproject Cost and Financing \n6.  The TA subproject is estimated to cost $380,000, of which $350,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. The government will provide counterpart support in \nthe form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, administrative assistance, and other in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nE.  Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n7.  WRDD will be the executing and implementing agency and provide oversight, ensure \ncoordination across sectors, and provide guidance to the implementation. A comprehensive \nproject management office will be established in WRDD. The project management office will be \nthe main contact point for ADB and will provide oversight and liaison with the districts and counties. \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Subproject Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  December 2018\u2013June 2020 \nExecuting and implementing agency  National Development and Reform Commission - WRDD \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nFirm: Quality- and  23 person-months  $252,000 \ncost-based \nProcurementa  To be procured by implementing agency \nShopping  2 contracts  $4,000 \nDisbursement  The technical assistance resources will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Equipment procured under the technical assistance will be turned over to \narrangement upon TA completion  the executing agency upon completion of TA activities. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, WRDD = Western Region Development Department. \na Procurement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", "3 \n8.
