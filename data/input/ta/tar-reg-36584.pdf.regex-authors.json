INTRODUCTION\n1. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) adopted poverty reduction as its overarching goal\nin 1999, and subsequently embraced the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as priority\nobjectives. Both poverty reduction and fostering fulfillment of the MDGs are affirmed in ADB\u2019s\nLong-Term Strategic Framework (2001\u20132015)1 and Medium-Term Strategy (2001\u20132005).2 An\nimportant part of efforts to focus  ADB\u2019s operations on poverty reduction has been to adapt\nestablished impact analysis practices. Efforts to adjust approaches to assess the impact of\nloans  on  poverty,  prior  to  and  after  their  implementation,  and  to  develop  and  apply  new\nmethods, have met with mixed success. Resource and time constraints often limit monitoring\nand assessment of project impact on poverty to what is administratively required. The Poverty\nReduction  Cooperation  Fund  (PRF)  established  by  the  Department  for  International\nDevelopment (DFID) of the Government of the United Kingdom provides an opportunity to pilot-\ntest new approaches for poverty monitoring in selected developing member countries (DMCs),\nand to develop new tools and more systematic methods for assessing the effectiveness of ADB\noperations in reducing poverty.\n2. The concept paper for the technical assistance (TA) was submitted to DFID on 13\nAugust 2002. On 23 September 2002, DFID formally approved the proposal.3 In accordance\nwith the PRF board paper,4 a peer review and project development team was established in\nOctober 2002, and the team provided inputs and recommendations for the design of the TA.5\nThe team broadly endorsed the proposal. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nII.  ISSUES\n3.  ADB and other national and international institutions seek to design projects and identify\ncountry-  or  sector-level  strategies  offering  the  greatest  reduction  of  poverty.  Analytical\ntechniques are used to assess the poverty impact of projects and programs, and to identify the\nmost effective ways of achieving sustained reductions in poverty. Although ADB and its partner\norganizations in DMCs have gained much experience in such analysis, the understanding of the\nmechanisms that link project and program outputs to sustained reductions in poverty is still\npartial and the measurement of the poverty impact of interventions is often inadequate. The TA\nfocuses on the development of tools for monitoring and understanding the poverty impact at\nvarious levels, suitable for use in operations by ADB and DMC staff developing and executing\nADB-financed interventions. Understanding the impact of ADB operations at the country level\nrequires analysis at sector and project levels. At the same time, understanding the overall\npoverty impact of discrete policy or project initiatives at the local level requires study at the\nsector or country level. In assessing the effectiveness of ADB aid, efforts must be considered in\nthe broader context of overall development efforts in the country and with the recognition that\nADB is one of many influences in the development arena. Accordingly, the approach taken in\nthe TA will include poverty analysis at various levels (e.g. household, community, and sector),\nfocusing on providing the information and analytical tools needed to define and understand the\nrelationship between poverty reduction efforts and outcomes at the different levels.\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2001.

Manila.\n5  The  peer  review  and  project  development  team  comprised  sector  and  poverty  specialists  from  regional\ndepartments; concerned resident missions; members of teams that prepare country strategies and programs\n(CSPs); and thematic poverty specialists from the Regional and Sustainable Development Department, Operations\nEvaluation Department, and the Economics and Research Department.", "2\n4. Providing ADB staff and partners in DMCs with accurate and easy-to-use data collection\nand analytical tools can improve the efficiency of poverty analysis while easing the operational\nburden of carrying out poverty monitoring and assessment activities. Such tools can be applied\nto strengthen the development and implementation of country strategies and programs (CSPs)\nand poverty reduction partnership agreements (PRPAs), and will facilitate accountability. This\nwill enable ADB and national agencies in DMCs to sharpen their understanding of the effects of\nprojects and programs on poverty, and to focus their efforts on the most effective interventions.\n5. ADB project implementation sometimes suffers from inadequate attention and resources\nbeing applied to distinct aspects of monitoring. Project management teams can get caught up in\nmonitoring financial and other implementation indicators, while neglecting to monitor impact\nindicators and carefully analyze the causal links between ADB-financed activities and poverty\noutcomes of greater long-term interest (e.g., indicators of poverty impact and aid effectiveness).\nEfforts  to  improve  monitoring  and  poverty  impact  assessment  (MPIA)  may  suggest\nreassessment of the resource allocation between country- and sector-level poverty diagnosis\nand research, project design, and monitoring activities. ADB can make a valuable contribution in\nMPIA by helping to make it an integral part of local decision-making processes. Accordingly,\nADB TA in MPIA should focus on building national capacities. Developing tools for easy and\nmore systematic poverty monitoring will be key in improving the capacity of ADB and DMCs to\nassess aid effectiveness.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Purpose and Output\n6. The goal of the TA is to enhance ADB's contribution to poverty reduction in DMCs. The\npurpose of the TA is to adapt existing approaches and pilot test customized poverty monitoring\nand analytical tools to enable better understanding and measurement of the underlying factors\nand mechanisms driving changes in the incidence and severity of poverty in selected DMCs.\nThe TA will develop these tools within the framework of the PRPAs, CSPs, and ongoing ADB\nprojects or programs in selected sectors and countries. The TA will focus on some of the major\nADB borrowing countries (although tools will be designed with a view to general applicability).\nThe tools and approaches developed through the TA will foster better identification, design, and\nmonitoring of poverty reduction programs and projects, and thereby improve in the effectiveness\nof  ADB-financed  poverty  reduction  efforts  throughout  DMCs.  The  implications  of  lessons\nlearned regarding the process, structure, and resource requirements for carrying out poverty\nimpact  assessment  will  be  reviewed  in  the  final  TA  report.  Several  other  TAs  are  being\nimplemented with related scope and objectives. These other efforts will be taken into account to\nensure sharing of knowledge and material and to avoid any duplication of effort.\n7. The specific outputs of the TA will be (i) a survey data depository that will provide easy\naccess to relevant statistical data for poverty analysis; (ii) a review of poverty measures and\nanalysis used in final or draft  PRPAs and corresponding  CSPs; (iii) innovative survey data\ncollection and processing tools to enable more cost-effective collection of baseline and follow-up\ndata at project and sector levels; (iv) poverty and inequality data generated at disaggregated\ngeographic  levels  (small  areas);  (v)  easy-to-use  analytical  protocols  to  model  poverty  and\ndistributional impacts of ADB-financed initiatives; and (vi) workshops on poverty monitoring and\nimpact assessment techniques for DMC and ADB staff.", "3\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities\n8. Current efforts to enhance the poverty focus of country strategies and loan evaluations\nmake insufficient use of available data to understand poverty in the context of specific countries\nand projects. This results from the high fixed costs of initially gathering and understanding\nprimary data, tight time schedules faced in loan preparation, and lack of easy-to-use analytical\ntools. Limited access to primary (micro-level) data by secondary analysts, limited research\ncapacity, lack of incentives, and conditions in  DMCs that are not conductive to carrying out\nthorough analysis, often prevent survey data from being used to generate relevant knowledge to\npolicy. Accordingly, the first activity will involve working closely with national statistical offices,\nline  ministries,  funding  agencies  and  nongovernment  organizations  collecting  statistical\ninformation to develop a data depository. The main mandate of the depository will be to gather\nsurvey data sets and ensure their proper documentation to ease access. This will be more than\na simple collection and storage exercise, and will include documentation, quality control, and\nstandardization of data and metadata. By improving the documentation and preservation of\nsurvey data, the depository will foster wider dissemination and application of survey data in\npoverty analysis and monitoring, and provide ADB staff with a mechanism for sharing good\npractices and preserving institutional memory in data collection and poverty monitoring.\n9. The second activity will review PRPAs and CSPs and will result in brief reports outlining\nthe poverty measures and analyses used in individual DMCs. A summary of the reports will\nreview (i) the methodology used in measuring poverty in  DMCs, (ii) the analysis applied in\nformulating PRPAs and CSPs, and (iii) the poverty monitoring arrangements incorporated in\nPRPAs and CSPs. The review will provide recommendations on ways of improving the analysis\nand monitoring of poverty in PRPAs and CSPs with due consideration of practical constraints\nfaced by analysts.\n10. Four subsequent activities will develop and disseminate a number of poverty monitoring\nand analytical tools intended as inputs into the preparation of poverty strategies and loans.\nThese cover small area estimation techniques, poverty monitoring survey instruments, and\nsector-specific analytical models for poverty impact assessment. The final activity involves\ndissemination workshops at ADB and in selected DMCs.\n11. In concert with another ongoing ADB TA,6 the TA will compile spatially disaggregated\ndata (small area estimates). Poverty statistics at the national or other aggregated levels are\noften unsuitable for impact assessment of specific projects and policies. Poverty data valid at\nthe local level can be used to develop local poverty profiles and derive information on past\npoverty dynamics. This information can be applied in project and strategy formulation and\nassessment to enhance their empirical foundations.\n12. Poverty monitoring survey instruments will be designed, including the development and\nimplementation on a pilot basis of household- and community-level questionnaires and poverty\nmonitoring surveys. The objective is to develop practical alternatives to the time-consuming and\nexpensive collection of income and expenditure data for assessing poverty.

The small-scale regional\ntechnical assistance (TA 6042), was approved on 22 September 2002, and is administered by the Development\nIndicators and Policy Research Division (ERDI). Data will be generated for Pakistan and will endeavor to gather\navailable data elsewhere.", "4\nsurvey instruments will be based on easy-to-collect poverty predictors7 that are derived using\nmultiple regression and principal component analysis.8 The key outputs of this component of the\nTA will be the development of cost-effective and rapid monitoring data collection instruments,\nalong with recommended administrative procedures for cooperating with national agencies,\nsampling  methods,  standard  questionnaires,  data  processing  programs  and  manuals,  and\nguidelines for statistical analysis and poverty assessment based on nonincome data.\n13. Sector-specific analytical models to assess project and policy impact on poverty will be\ndeveloped, principally through adaptation of existing partial and general equilibrium models. By\nsharpening the focus of existing models on poverty and distributional issues, models aim to\nenable more holistic assessment of the impact of projects, policies, and external events on\ndistribution, poverty, and broader welfare. Partial equilibrium models to be adapted include\ndemand or supply response analysis disaggregated across the poor and nonpoor, household\nmodels, and measures of market performance.9 General equilibrium modeling will recollect and\nadapt  existing  social  accounting  matrixes  and  computable  general  equilibrium  models  for\nselected DMCs, and update and customize models to examine particular sectors and identify\ndistributional consequences of interventions in their broader economic context. When possible,\nmodels will be developed as user-friendly Microsoft Excel applications to foster integration of\ncountry data for impact assessment by analysts in ADB and  DMCs,  and  will  include  user\ninstructions, interpretation guidelines, and training material.\n14. Sector and project analytical tools will be developed in the context  of  ongoing  ADB\noperations to ensure operational relevance and suitability. The following mix of countries and\nsectors  is  proposed:  (i)  the  People's  Republic  of  China,  for  transport  infrastructure;  (ii)\nIndonesia, for education; (iii) Pakistan, for governance and finance; and (iv) Viet Nam, for\nagriculture and natural resource management.10 The selection reflects core areas of lending\namong the most active ADB borrowers. TA implementation will proceed in close cooperation\nwith national agencies, with participation of national statistics offices being key for undertaking\ndata collection and statistical capacity building project components. Other national agencies\nhave been identified in each country for collaboration in poverty analysis work under the TA.\n15. To assure proper dissemination and institutionalization of these data collection and\nanalytical tools, activities will result in technical reports and manuals. These will be used to\ndevelop training material that will be used in workshops organized in four selected DMCs and at\nADB headquarters. The TA team will prepare interim reports for the TA after the first year and a\nfinal report at the conclusion of the TA.\n                                                \n7  (ADB. 2001. Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects, Appendix\n3, Box 3.4, page 64. Manila). Poverty predictors are easy-to-collect variables identified to be highly correlated with\nstandard poverty measures through multivariate analysis.\n8  The development of these tools will build on existing standard survey instruments such as the Core Welfare\nIndicators Questionnaire and Living Standards Measurement Studies (World Bank), the Multiple Indicators Clusters\nSurvey (United Nations Children\u2019s Fund ), the Demographic and Health Surveys (Macro International Ltd), etc.\n9  This activity will follow the approach of Sadoulet and de Janvry. 1994. Quantitative Development Policy Analysis,\nBaltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, and will take into account work being undertaken at the World\nBank (e.g., poverty impact analysis toolkit \u2013http://www.worldbank.org/poverty/psia/tools.htm, and other initiatives).\n10 Projects with which the activities of this TA will be coordinated are: Loan 1863 Decentralized Basic Education\nProject and related TAs that support this loan in Indonesia; loans 1898 and 1899 Access to Justice as well as other\nongoing or soon to be approved TAs and loans in Pakistan; loan 1918 Southern Sichuan Roads Development and\na number of other ongoing TAs, e.g., TA 3900\u2013involving road infrastructure in People\u2019s Republic of China, and loan\n1515 Forestry Sector in Viet Nam. Finalization of this list awaits formal concurrence by the involved executing\nagencies and ADB regional departments.", "5\nC.  Cost and Financing\n16. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, comprising $367,000 in\nforeign exchange and $233,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The PRF will finance the TA\non a grant basis and ADB will administer it.\n17. The TA will finance consultancy work; the implementation of monitoring surveys on a\npilot basis; the acquisition of software and equipment; the production and dissemination of\ntraining and reference materials; and the organization of five workshops to present, review, and\ndiscuss TA outputs. The cost estimates and financing plan are presented in Appendix 2.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n18. The  Economics  and  Research  Department\u2019s  Development  Indicators  and  Policy\nResearch Division (ERDI) in ADB will implement the TA in close collaboration with other ADB\ndepartments, particularly with mission leaders in the proposed sector, and country pairs and\npoverty experts in resident missions and regional departments. Project and resident missions\nstaff will be asked to identify and facilitate linkages with relevant national agencies and to advise\nto ensure operational relevance of the TA. Standing peer review and project development teams\nwill ensure coordination and advice of ADB knowledge-based departments.\n19. The  TA  will  be  carried  out  over  a  24-month  period  starting  in  December  2002.\nDepartments of statistics, planning, policy analysis, and implementing agencies in the sectors of\nthe selected projects in the four DMCs will be consulted throughout TA implementation.\n20. Project implementation will require 10 person-months of international and 26 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants, who will be recruited on an individual basis. Indicated areas of\nexpertise required are (i) survey data processing (6 person-months of a domestic consultant);\n(ii) poverty analysis (1 person-month of an international consultant); (iii) applied microeconomic\nmodeling (3 person-months of international and 8 person-months of domestic consultants); (iv)\ngeneral equilibrium modeling (3 person-months of an international consultant); (v) sampling and\nsurvey methods (3 person-months of an international consultant); and (vi) household survey\nexecution (12 person-months of domestic consultancy). ADB will engage the consultants in\naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory\nto ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix\n3. Equipment purchases will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement.\n21. TA outputs will be disseminated through workshops and later through the Internet for a\nbroader audience. One workshop for ADB staff will be held at ADB headquarters, and four will\nbe held in the selected  DMCs so that representatives from relevant government agencies,\nnongovernment agencies active in poverty reduction initiatives, and researchers from other\ninstitutions can learn about the TA and review and discuss its outputs. All nonconfidential TA\noutputs will be made available on-line via the ADB web site.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n22. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB\nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to be financed on a\ngrant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for Developing Tools for Assessing the\nEffectiveness of ADB Operations in Reducing Poverty, and hereby reports this action to the\nBoard.", "6 Appendix 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nPerformance Monitoring Assumptions\nDesign Summary\nIndicators/Targets Mechanisms and Risks\nGoal\nIncrease effectiveness Higher impact of ADB \u2022 In the short term: (i)\nof aid from the Asian lending on poverty. review of country\nDevelopment Bank strategies and programs\n(ADB).
