INTRODUCTION\n1. During the March 1999 Midterm Review  of  the  Bank\u2019s Operational  Program  in  the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the Government requested the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB)  to  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  capacity  building  of  the  insurance  sector\nregulatory and supervision system. The goal of the TA is to develop the institutional capacity of\nthe China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC). CIRC was set up in December 1998 to\npromote healthy and orderly growth of the insurance sector so that it can facilitate long-term\ncontractual savings. Sound development of the insurance sector is critical to enhance social\nsecurity coverage of the PRC\u2019s population, while generating long-term funds that will broaden\nthe capital markets. In response to the request, the Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC in May\n1999 and reached an understanding with CIRC on the objectives, scope, cost, financing, and\nimplementation arrangements for the TA.1 The logical framework is provided in Appendix 1.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The PRC\u2019s insurance industry developed rapidly; its average annual growth was nearly\n30 percent per annum in premium income between 1981 to 1998. The total insurance premium\nincome reached Y125 billion ($15 billion) in 1998, which was 14 percent higher than that in\n1997. Life insurance registered an even faster growth in 1998: its premium income grew by\n23 percent from the 1997 level, reaching Y68 billion ($8.3 billion). Despite the rapid growth, the\nper capita insurance premium in the PRC is still less than 2 percent of the world average, and\nthe insurance sector faces a number of impediments, from an ineffective regulatory environment\nto poor financial condition of insurance companies. By the end of 1998, PRC had 25 registered\ninsurance businesses, 4 of which were wholly state-owned companies, 9 joint-stock companies,\n3 joint ventures owned by PRC and foreign insurance companies, and the remaining 9 branches\nor subsidiaries of the foreign insurance companies.\n3. The first foreign insurance company, the American International Group, started its PRC\noperations  in  1992  in  Shanghai,  under  the  Temporary  Regulation  on  the  Management  of\nForeign Insurance Companies in Shanghai of 1992. At present, 12 foreign insurance company\nbranches and joint ventures operate in the PRC, almost half of the total number of companies in\nthe insurance market. However, foreign insurance companies can conduct businesses only in\nShanghai and Guangzhou, and their businesses are restricted to individual life and nonlife\nproducts,  covering  automobile,  medical,  and  property  insurances.  The  insurance  sector\nliberalization is an important topic in the ongoing World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations.\nCIRC  is  preparing  regulations  and  procedures  for  foreign  insurance  companies  and\nrepresentative offices. The Government currently licenses foreign companies on a case-by-case\nbasis.\n4. The Government has taken a number of significant measures to reform the insurance\nsector.  These  include  (i)  splitting  the  monoinsurance  company,  the  People\u2019s  Insurance\nCompany of China, into three companies covering nonlife, life, and reinsurance services, and\nintroducing professional  management  in  these  companies;  (ii)  initiating  and  expediting  the\ncommercialization process of state-owned insurance companies and improving their corporate\ngovernance; (iii) promoting joint-stock insurance companies to upgrade corporate governance\nstructure of the industry; (iv) transferring sector policy and regulatory functions from People\u2019s\nBank of China (PBC, the central bank) to CIRC; and (v) separating commercial insurance and\nthe social security systems. The TA will help CIRC prepare regulations and procedures covering\n                                               \n1  The TA was first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities in July 1999.", "2\norganization, operations, and market behavior of insurance companies, and the management of\ninsurance intermediaries.\n5. The PRC insurance sector faces a number of constraints that affect its future growth.\nFirst, the asset quality and financial position of insurance companies are poor, since a large\nproportion of their assets comprise industrial and real estate loans, which are now mostly\nnonperforming. In addition, most life insurance companies suffered financial losses as interest\nrates on deposit fell over the last two years. Second, the regulatory and supervisory framework\nfor the insurance sector is weak and the Insurance Law of 1995 restricts insurance company\ninvestment  to  bank  deposits  and  Government  securities.  Third,  the  management  and\nprofessional standards of the sector are low. A number of insurance companies have expanded\nrapidly over the past years without a proper business strategy. Often these companies have low\nstandards  of  accounting  and  lack  an  adequate  concept  of  risk  management.  Fourth,\nprofessional qualification standards and a certification system are lacking.2 The problems in the\ninsurance  sector  are  further  magnified  by  the  lack  of  (i)  internal  control  mechanisms  in\ninsurance companies as the sector has developed too fast, (ii) an effective legal, regulatory and\nsupervisory framework and enforcement mechanism, and (iii) investment options available for\ninsurance companies.\n6. As a part of the Government\u2019s effort to rationalize regulatory and supervisory functions of\nessential segments of the financial sector, i.e., banking, insurance, and securities markets,\nCIRC  took  over  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  responsibilities  from  the  former  Insurance\nDepartment of PBC.  The insurance companies operate under the Insurance Law; regulations of\nthe State Council; and procedures and administrative orders issued by PBC, CIRC, and other\nrelevant ministries. The Insurance Law and related regulations rely largely on administrative\nmeasures and strict restrictions to safeguard the solvency of insurance companies rather than\non well-adopted prudential norms. The Insurance Law requires separation of life and nonlife\ninsurance businesses and restricts the available channels for premium income investments.\n7. Currently,  CIRC  has  a  staff  of  about  100  with  no  regional  or  local  offices.  About\n40 percent of the CIRC staff are from the former Insurance Department of PBC and others are\nfrom People\u2019s Insurance Company of China and various ministries. CIRC is  headed by  a\nchairperson supported by four vice chairpersons and its key departments include administration,\nnonlife insurance, life insurance, insurance intermediaries, accounting and fund management,\npolicy and legal, international, and human resources. The Policy and Legal Department licenses\ninsurance companies; and the other three functional departments license branch businesses of\ninsurance companies and intermediaries. Many CIRC staff members are young and highly\nmotivated, and have university and postgraduate degrees.\n8. Insurance companies under the law can only invest in bank deposits, treasury bonds,\nfinancial institution bonds, and products approved under the law by the State Council on a case-\nby-case basis.  Because of these restrictions, the return on the insurance companies\u2019 portfolio\nheld largely in commercial bank deposits has been low.  Effective May 1999, the State Council\nhas allowed insurance companies to invest up to 10 percent of their total assets in corporate\nbonds issued by Central-Government-owned corporations in railway, power, and other major\ninfrastructure projects. The prohibition on insurance companies to invest in the stock market\nhinders the development of the capital markets.\n                                               \n2  Some insurance companies have no standard fee schemes, some insurance intermediaries operate without\nlicense and some have demonstrated questionable professional ethics that have seriously damaged the sector\nimage.", "3\n 9. To fulfill its regulatory and supervisory responsibilities, CIRC is keen to improve its\ninstitutional capabilities to ensure appropriate market behavior and  improve  prudential  and\nsolvency norms3 for insurance companies. CIRC needs to design and implement adequate\nprudential and solvency norms; upgrade its supervision, inspection, and enforcement functions;\nbuild a sound legal and regulatory framework; and ensure that the insurance coverage of the\ngeneral population and business expands and the insurance sector functions in an orderly\nmanner.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n10. ADB\u2019s overall TA program in the PRC financial sector aims to support policy, legal, and\nregulatory reforms to develop efficient financial markets. The TA  will promote healthy and\norderly growth of the PRC insurance sector, with a view to mobilizing long-term contractual\nsavings and facilitating the ongoing social security reform process, that is essential for the\nrestructuring of state-owned enterprises. The TA will help (i) strengthen the legal and regulatory\nframework and operational guidelines for the PRC insurance sector in line with international\nstandards; (ii) upgrade CIRC\u2019s capabilities as the regulator and supervisor of the insurance\nsector; (iii) establish an internal solvency rating system for insurance companies; (iv) develop\nprofessional and management standards for the insurance sector; and (v) improve financial\nsoundness of insurance companies.\nB. Scope\n11. The TA will focus on\n(i)  identifying strengths, weaknesses and potential risks of the insurance sector and\nits regulatory system, and recommending suitable organizational structure for\nCIRC;\n(ii)  advising on how to convert insurance sector associations into self-regulatory\norganizations;\n(iii)  assessing  the  financial  and  economic  implications  of  investment  restrictions\nimposed  on  insurance  companies,  and  recommending  investment  codes  for\ninsurance companies with adequate safeguards;\n(iv)  developing regulatory and supervision guidelines,  inspection handbooks,  and\nenforcement  manuals  for  life  and  nonlife  supervision  divisions  of  CIRC,  to\nestablish general rules for CIRC\u2019s supervisions of the insurance sector to ensure\nadequate market behavior;\n(v)  developing  a  set  of  prudential  and  solvency  norms  that  are  consistent  with\ninternational standards and practice in the PRC, including a set of parameters\nand analytical methodologies for prudential and solvency tests, and a  rating\nsystem for insurance companies to be part of the early warning system to assess\nthe health of the insurance companies;\n                                               \n3  Prudential and solvency norms issued by PBC in September 1998 define the solvency margin based on the size\nof the premium income of an insurance company and do not take into account types of risk it underwrites.", "4\n(vi)  developing actuarial guidelines to enable insurance companies to better identify\nand control risks, improving their accounting and corporate planning standards,\nand  developing  qualification  procedures  for  insurance  sector  professionals,\nincluding actuaries, underwriters, adjusters, surveyors, agents, and brokers;\n(vii)  reviewing  and  evaluating  the present  Insurance  Law  and  assisting  CIRC  to\namend the law, taking into account the future sector needs; and\n(viii)  helping CIRC establish close ties with the International Association of Insurance\nSupervisors (IAIS) and other international organizations in the insurance sector,\nintroducing to CIRC appropriate regulatory and supervisory guidelines issued by\nIAIS, and exploring bilateral and multilateral exchange programs between CIRC\nand other IAIS members.\n C. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n \n12. The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $900,000  equivalent,  including  a  foreign\nexchange cost of $580,000 and a local currency cost of $320,000 equivalent. ADB will finance\n$700,000 of the total cost including the foreign exchange cost of $580,000 and local cost of\n$120,000 equivalent, on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government\nof Japan. The Government will contribute $200,000 in kind for office space, counterpart staff,\nand other services. The detailed cost estimates and the financing plan of the TA are in Appendix\n2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n13. CIRC will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A working group will be established,\nheaded by the Director General of the International Department of CIRC and consisting of\ndirectors and staff members of the relevant CIRC departments, who will serve as counterparts\nof the consultants and ensure successful TA implementation. CIRC will provide the necessary\noffice space, counterpart staff, transportation, and other services to the consultants and will\narrange appointments for the consultants with relevant agencies and organizations.\n14. The TA will require 32 person-months of consulting service, including 16 person-months\nof  international  and  16  person-months  of  domestic  consultants.
