THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  Context. Solomon Islands and Vanuatu are among the poorest countries in the Pacific, \nwith young and fast-growing populations. The population of Solomon Islands has tripled since \nindependence in 1978, reaching over 721,000 in 2019, with more than 50% being of school age.1 \nThe country has a gross domestic product per capita of $2,021,2 and the share of the population \nliving  in  extreme  poverty  (below  $1.90  per  day)  is  24.3%.3 The  United  Nations  Human \nDevelopment Index, which summarizes average national achievement across health, education, \nand standards of living, ranked Solomon Islands at 151st (of 189 economies) in 2020. 4 Vanuatu\u2019s \npopulation surpassed 301,000 in 2020, with a gross domestic product per capita of $3,008 and \n14.4% living in extreme poverty; and it was ranked 140th in the Human Development Index in \n2020 (footnotes 1\u20134). Common development constraints include remoteness, vulnerability to \nshocks, high costs of service delivery, and weak public sector capacity. \n \n2.  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected both economies adversely, \nand although they have managed to keep the number of cases at low levels due to timely border \nclosures,  the  socioeconomic  costs  are  high. 5  Both  countries  saw  significant  economic \ncontractions\u2014by 4.5% for Solomon Islands and 8.5% for Vanuatu in 2020\u2014compared to average \ngrowth of 4.1% and 2.8%, respectively in 2010\u20132019 (footnote 2). The impacts of the COVID-19 \npandemic may push an additional 4%\u20135% of the population into extreme poverty.6 Economic \nrecovery is expected to commence in 2021 for Solomon Islands and in 2022 for Vanuatu, as travel \nand trade restrictions are lifted, but the outlook is subject to several downside risks.7 \n \n3.  Progress  in  education.  Both  governments  have  made  significant  improvements  in \nexpanding access to early childhood education and primary education. Currently, 92% of age-\nappropriate children are attending primary schools and approximately 70% are in early childhood \nprograms before entering primary schools in the two countries. Learning outcomes, measured by \nstandardized tests in numeracy and literacy, have improved since 2015 and are attributed to an \nincreased number of certified teachers, new syllabi, teachers\u2019 guides, and learning materials.8 In \nVanuatu, the implementation of a new primary years\u2019 curriculum has been a major development. \nSolomon Islands has managed to reduce class sizes and increase pre- and in-service training of \nteachers. \n \n \n1  United Nations.

Port Vila. \n \n ", "2   \n4.  Key challenges. Despite this progress, both governments have identified (i) expansion of \naccess to education; (ii) improved quality and relevance; and (iii) strengthened educational \nmanagement and systems, as priority improvement areas. Ambitious reform agendas to be \nimplemented until 2030 are detailed in Solomon Islands Education Strategic Framework 2016\u2013\n2030 and Vanuatu Education and Training Sector Strategic Plan 2020\u20132030 (footnote 8). \n \n5.  Limited  participation  in  post  primary  education.  Enrollment  in  senior  secondary \neducation is approximately 30% of the potential student population in Solomon Islands, and only \n7% of girls complete their studies at the secondary level. Participation in tertiary education is \namong the lowest in the world at 3.5%. In Vanuatu, enrollment is 43% of the secondary school-\naged population. There is limited participation of girls in science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics and in technical and vocational education and training programs, translating to low \nlabor force participation. The low enrollment in secondary education is partly due to insufficient \nplaces in secondary schools for the growing number of students. Other barriers to participation \nare families\u2019 inability to afford school fees, perceived lack of quality, and large class sizes.9 \n \n6.  Low  quality  and  relevance.  Improvements  in  education  quality  and  relevance  are \nnecessary to foster lifelong learners able to adapt to rapid changes. Slow progress in developing \nnew secondary curricula and outdated teaching practices are among the reasons for low student \nperformance in both countries. There are limited possibilities for learners to apply theoretical \nknowledge.  Important  content  like  information  and  communication  technology  literacy, \ncollaboration, and critical thinking to prepare students for tertiary education and employment are \nlacking. Limited linkages with job opportunities and higher education institutions are barriers for \nmaking secondary education relevant for working life, further studies, and lifelong learning. \n \n7.  Management capacity. Both governments recognize that strengthening of education \nmanagement capacity and systems is needed to successfully implement reforms and improve \nefficiency and effectiveness. Extensive capacity building and improved functionality of existing \ntools and processes are needed. Collection of sex-disaggregated data, planning, budgeting, asset \nmanagement, forecasting of education needs, monitoring and evaluation, as well as alignment of \nreporting between the central, provincial, and school level are all areas to be addressed. \n  \n8.  ADB assistance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting increased higher \neducation opportunities in Solomon Islands through expansion of the University of the South \nPacific\u2019s local campus (multitranche financing facility tranche 2 of $17.0 million).10 Both countries \nalso receive assistance via the regional technical assistance (TA) Strengthening Education in the \nPacific Region (total TA amount of $19.5 million).11 Previous education interventions in these \ncountries are the reconstruction of schools after the 2015 Cyclone Pam in Vanuatu and support \nfor the use of information and communication technology for better education services in Solomon \nIslands.12  \n \n9.  Both governments have requested ADB support for future education sector projects. \nPreliminary intervention areas have been identified as: (i) strengthened education management \ncapacity and tools for improved gender-responsive forecasting, planning, management, and \nmonitoring of the sector; (ii) expansion and quality improvements of educational infrastructure \nwith a special focus on gender equity, social inclusion, and digital solutions for teaching and \n \n9  Government of Vanuatu, Ministry of Education and Training. 2018.

The ADB financing required for the projects are estimated at (i) $10 million for the Senior \nSecondary Education Improvement Project in Solomon Islands with expected consideration by \nADB\u2019s Board of Directors in 2023, and (ii) $8 million for the Education Sector Improvement Project \nin Vanuatu with expected consideration by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in 2023.This TA facility and \nthe ensuing projects are listed in the respective countries\u2019 country operations business plans for \n2021\u20132023.13 The facility will contribute to (i) the Sustainable Development Goals 4 and 5,14 (ii) \nADB Strategy 2030\u2019s operational priorities,15 and (iii) the Pacific Approach 2021\u20132025.16 \n \n11.  The TA facility combines the preparation of the two ensuing investment projects to improve \nproject design. Avenues for synergies and cooperation in terms of educational resource sharing \nand knowledge exchange between the countries and the wider Pacific region will be facilitated, \nconsidering the ongoing implementation of the Pacific Regional Education Framework.17 The \napproach will also enhance operational efficiency by optimizing the value of TA consultants for \nsimilar  assessments,  studies,  capacity  strengthening,  policy  advice,  and  due  diligence \nrequirements for the respective projects. \n \n12.  The facility will further strengthen the education portfolio in the Pacific and improve ADB\u2019s \ntechnical support and knowledge services to Solomon Islands and Vanuatu; help identify and \nmobilize additional financial and knowledge resources for reform; and improve ADB\u2019s response \nto client needs concerning project design, project management, and education sector knowledge \nand lesson sharing. \n \n13.  Development partner engagement. ADB has actively engaged in discussions with \ndevelopment partners in the education sector in both countries. The international development \ncommunity, including the governments of Australia and New Zealand, is supporting Solomon \nIslands  for  early  childhood  development  and  improved  primary  education. In  Vanuatu, the \nGovernment of New Zealand has recently committed to a new, 10-year education sector program \nexpected to start in 2023. Based on dialogue with the governments and development partners, \nthe potential ADB-funded investments (paras. 9\u201310) would be highly relevant and complementary \nto partner support.  \n \nB.

The output \nwill  also  identify  improvement  potential  for  collection  of  sex-disaggregated  education  data, \nanalytics, planning, reporting, and monitoring and evaluation.  \n \n16.  Output 3: Capacity to apply innovative practices and technology solutions for \ndesign of ensuing projects strengthened. In a participatory manner, knowledge sharing of \nnational, regional, and international best practices will be provided to the implementing agencies \nand key education stakeholders via technical experts and capacity building measures, to be \nincorporated into project designs. The topics are expected to cover (i) the potential for increased \nusage of education technology solutions; (ii) identification of national, regional, and international \nopen education repositories of teaching and learning materials that can be contextualized; (iii) \npedagogical  approaches  to  strengthening  21st  century  skills,  mechanisms  to  support \nnontraditional education and career choices for boys and girls, with a special emphasis on \nencouraging girls to explore science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; (iv) inclusion of \napplicable, work-related, and entrepreneurial skills in secondary education; and (v) best practices \nto include climate change education, and address gender norms and gender bias in curricula. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $1,050,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 1 and the indicative consultants\u2019 inputs for the respective projects are listed \nin Appendix 2. The governments of Solomon Islands and Vanuatu will provide counterpart support \nin the form of staff, office space, office supplies, coordination assistance, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The governments have been informed that approval of the TA facility does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  and  be  responsible  for  the  selection,  supervision,  and \nevaluation of consultants. In close cooperation with the Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office, \nthe Social Sectors and Public Sector Management Division of ADB\u2019s Pacific Department will \nimplement the TA and be accountable for the outputs. The division will carry out TA administration, \n \n18 This includes secondary education assessments for expanded access with focus on gender equity and inclusion, \nstudies on quality and relevance constraints, and structural and educational management constraints. \n \n ", "5 \nsupervision, implementation oversight, coordination with concerned agencies in Solomon Islands \nand Vanuatu, and communication with consultants and stakeholders. The Ministry of Education \nand Human Resource Development in Solomon Islands and the Ministry of Education and \nTraining in Vanuatu are the implementing agencies for the TA and ensuing projects. They will \nprovide information access and data, available studies, research, and reports, and facilitate liaison \nwith stakeholders to support TA implementation.
