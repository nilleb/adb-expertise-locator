INTRODUCTION\n1. During  the  World  Bank-coordinated  multiagency  joint  assessment  mission  (October-\nNovember 1999), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) reviewed the transport sector restoration\nand development requirements of East Timor for the short and medium term (1 to 3 years). ADB-\nfunded technical assistance1 (TA) prepared an approach for transport sector establishment with\nrequirements to implement effective transport sector institutions and regulatory frameworks. The\nADB-administered Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project (EIRP), is supporting the setting\nup  of  a  maintenance  field  organization  for  the  road  sector,  including  asset  and  financial\nmanagement systems and human resources planning.2\n2. During  the  ADB  Implementation  Review  Mission  for  the  EIRP,  the  transport  sector\nrestoration and development requirements of East Timor were reviewed and the United Nations\nTransitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) and East Timor Transitional Administration\n(ETTA) requested further ADB TA for implementation of the proposed transport sector institutions.\n3. This report was prepared on the basis of the Mission\u2019s discussions and observations in the\nfield. The Mission reached understandings with the East Timorese counterparts and UNTAET\norganizational and planning elements on the TA objectives and scope.3 A framework for the TA is\nprovided in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n4. During the month following the democratic consultation of 30 August 1999, East Timor\nexperienced a campaign of destruction and terror, during which much of the property of value was\nremoved,  burned,  or  destroyed,  including  residential  and  public  buildings,  utilities,\ntelecommunications  facilities,  inventories  of  essential  food,  and  agriculture  stocks.  All  current\nadministrative  structures  became  dysfunctional  with  all  transport  documentation  and  most\npremises destroyed, and institutions depleted of their staff. Under a resolution of the Security\nCouncil of the United Nations, UNTAET was established with powers to (i) ensure stability; (ii)\nestablish  a  transitional  government;  and  (iii)  establish  the  judiciary,  laws,  and  policies.\nInfrastructure sectors have been organized under a cabinet member of ETTA, whose portfolio\nincludes telecommunications, postal services, electricity, water and sanitation, transport and roads,\nport management, and civil aviation. Under the current planning, a director general is responsible\nfor the daily management of these services with a small staff of international and East Timorese\nstaff.  ETTA  operates  under  Consolidated  Fund  of  East  Timor  (CFET),  which  provides\nestablishment of limited local administration and recurrent resources.\n5. To plan for the medium-term rehabilitation in a coordinated manner, a joint assessment\nmission coordinated by the World Bank was fielded in October-November 1999 to prepare a\nmedium-term restoration program. Implementation of this program has been funded from the Trust\nFund for East Timor (TFET). ADB is administering the EIRP. A supplementary EIRP (Phase 2) has\nbeen prepared to stabilize the road network and enable it to be maintained with a relatively modest\nbudget, and to establish a viable and efficient maintenance operation in East Timor. ADB-funded\nTA (footnote 1) has proposed institutional and legal arrangements for establishing the road, port,\nand airport subsectors, and prepared a medium-term development program for these transport\nmodes to contribute to poverty reduction and economic growth.\n                                                \n1 TA 3401-ETM: Transport Sector Restoration, for $1,000,000, approved on 10 February 2000.\n2 Grant 8181-ETM: Emergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project, for $29.8 million, approved on 13 April 2000.\n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in March 2001.", "2\n6. The headquarters of East Timor's Department of Infrastructure and its transport division is\nin Dili. The Department of Infrastructure manages ports, airports, and road activities, with each\nsection having its own head. The cabinet agreed on 12 September 2000 to establish for the\ntransport  sector  common  legislation  that  would  embrace  the  three  transport  modes:  roads,\nmaritime, and aviation subsectors. The principles of this framework also provide for each subsector\nto be managed by a semiautonomous organization and that these coordinate their activities to\nfocus on efficiency and effectiveness.\n7. Road Administration. The road network comprises about 1,400 kilometer (km) of main\nroads and 6,600 km of rural roads and 450 bridges. The network was built to minimum standards\nto provide all-weather access to small and light vehicle traffic. The limited maintenance and the low\ndesign standard have compound the maintenance challenge together with heavy recent traffic and\nloads and the changing course of the many braided rivers flowing from north to south. The network\nhas, as a consequence, incurred a large backlog of road repair needs in addition to the standard\nneed for ordinary routine maintenance. Most district roads are in poor or very poor condition, which\ninhibits  commercial  activity.  Even  under  the  best  conditions,  this  network  in  its  geological\nenvironment requires a moderate to high level of maintenance.\n8. The road administration remains to be established, with its (i) organization structures, (ii)\ndelegations, decision, and management arrangements; (iii) reporting and financial systems; (iv)\noperational mechanisms and structures; and (v) human resources and training, with a goal to\nensure accountability for management and operations. Each sector will be administered by a\nsemiautonomous organization focus on direct accountability and management efficiency. The road\nadministration needs (i) a small permanent planning, financial, and technical staff; (ii) a regional\nstructure with a contract management framework and reporting system; and (iii) field staff to ensure\nsustainability of the network on recurrent basis. The appropriate management and administrative\nstructures will be identified by introducing performance indicators that measure that structures and\nmechanisms that will be effective in East Timor.\n9. Maritime Administration. The maritime infrastructure includes the ports in Carabela, Com\nDili, and Laleia; smaller wharves in Liquica and Oecussi; and slip-landing structures and sites in\nBatugade, Oecussi, and Suai. Dili Port currently receives an average of 36 vessels and handles\n1,907 twenty-foot container equivalent units and 9.5 tons of bulk cargo per month. Other ports are\nused to a minor extent, although services are planned between Dili and Oecussi. The head of ports\nmanages the port sector and Dili port is a responsibility of a harbor master.\n10. The port sector is envisaged to be organized under a semiautonomous ports\u2019 authority as a\nself-financing  and  eventually  an  East  Timorese-managed  entity  with  a  mission  to  deliver\ncompetitive port services. User charges of about $0.7 million per annum are being collected for the\nport services. The charges cover about half of the current recurrent expenditures, which include\nremuneration of local and foreign staff. The powers, organizational structures, management and\nfinancial management systems, human resources development and training, regulatory framework,\nand relationship with the government and international maritime conventions affecting the authority\nremain to be established to support optimal port operations.\n11. Aviation Administration. East Timor has two international standard airports with sealed\nrunways and eight grass landing fields. Traffic at the Dili airport handles 491 aircraft landings and\ndepartures per month, two thirds by the United Nations Peacekeeping Force (UNPKF) and about\none third is commercial traffic. Dili airport currently handles about 3,036 passengers per month.\nFrom 1 March 2001, Dili airport is being managed by Aeroportos de Portugal SA under bilateral\nfunding from the Government of Portugal. This will provide airport operational services and training\na total of 48 airport staff. Airport maintenance and consumables, and preparation of the envisaged", "3\nairport authority and the aviation sector regulatory framework remain the responsibility of the\nUNTAET-ETTA.\n12. Similar to the plans for the ports subsector, a civil aviation authority has been envisaged as\na self-financing and a locally managed entity to deliver competitive aviation services. The entity is\nto finance its operations from user charges. An inclusive and consultative process is required to\nfully detail the legislation for an airport authority providing its powers, organizational structures,\nmanagement and financial management systems, human resources development and training,\nregulatory  framework,  relationship  with  the  government,  and  accession  to  international\nconventions.\n13. Approval Process. Adopting the ongoing process in East Timor targeting promulgation of\nthe basic law, the consultations on the preparation of legislation for the airport and port authorities\nand the road administration will be carried out during the rest of 2001 with a target to submit an in-\nprinciple  approved  proposal  to  the  cabinet  and  national  parliament  of  the  new  government\nexpected to be in place late 2001. Implementation of the operational improvements and migration\ntoward  autonomous  and  effective  service  delivery  will  be  carried  out  concurrently  with  this\npreparation process.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n14. The objective of the TA is to support establishment of sustainable operations, management,\nand administration of the transport sectors. The TA will assist legal and operational establishment\nof effective and appropriately sized operations of (i) a port authority, (ii) an airport authority, and (iii)\na road administration. The TA will identify effective management and administrative structures and\nprocesses through a stakeholder analysis, demand-based service delivery assessment, and an\ninclusive consultation using performance-based evaluations of agencies to determine operational\narrangements for delivery of optimal services.\nB.  Scope\n15. The TA scope will include (i) a review of the legal, regulatory, and policy proposals for the\ntransport sectors covering roads, ports, and aviation subsectors; finalization of these proposals;\nand  support  for  their  implementation;  (ii)  a  review  of  the  institutional  and  administrative\narrangements  proposed  for  the  transport  sectors,  finalization  of  these  proposals  carrying  out\nextensive consultations to ensure sustainability of the plans, and support for their implementation;\nand (iii) preparation and support for implementation of a transitional plan transferring transport\nsector management to East Timorese.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The TA is estimated to cost $500,000. This includes international consultant remuneration\nand per diems, international and local travel, communications, office supplies and equipment, and\ncontingencies. The TA will also finance all costs of East Timorese counterpart consultants in the\nabsence of an administration with a local payroll for counterpart staff. The TA will be financed by\nADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. Detailed\ncost estimates are provided in Appendix 2.", "4\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n17. The TA will require about 16 person-months of consulting services from an international\nfirm  and  about  20  person-months  of  East  Timorese  consultant  services.  The  TA  requires\nconsultant  services  in  institutional  restructuring,  corporate  planning,  financial  management,\nadministration and control functions, human resources management and training, outsourcing and\ncontract management, implementation of community-based development, quality control, maritime\neconomics, transport economics and planning, transport policy and legal instruments, road agency\nand  service  delivery  planning,  port  management  and  service  delivery  planning,  and  airport\nmanagement and service delivery planning. The consultants will be selected in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the\nengagement of domestic consultants. The outline terms of reference for the international consulting\nservices are in Appendix 3.\n18. The  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  will  be  the  Department  of  Infrastructure.  Daily  TA\nactivities will be carried out in close consultation with sector stakeholders, sector operations of the\nairport, port and the road administration, and other funding agencies active in East Timor. A\nsteering committee will be established and convened frequently to support the TA activities and to\nprovide advice to the consultants. The committee will include representatives from the Department\nof Infrastructure and its port, airport, and road services division; the Central Fiscal Authority; Office\nof Legal Affairs of UNTAET-ETTA, East Timor Development Agency; Department of Economic\nAffairs; and Office of the ETTA Administrator.\n19. The TA will be carried out over a period of 12 months commencing in September 2001 and\nending in August 2002. The consultants will submit an inception report four weeks after starting\ntheir services, periodic reports, a medium-term report, a draft final report, and a final report.\nTripartite meetings involving the steering committee, the consultants, and ADB will be convened to\nconsider the reports. The consultant will arrange a minimum of four tripartite meetings to ensure a\nclose  monitoring  and  consultation  process.  The  consultant  will  organize  workshops  among\ntransport sector stakeholders to develop a consensus on the proposals and action plans.
