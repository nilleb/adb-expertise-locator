INTRODUCTION \n1.  Over the last 5 years, the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB), as an international \nstandard-setting organization, has developed a range of standards and guidance papers to \npromote and enhance the soundness and stability of the Islamic financial services industry, \nbroadly  defined  to  include  banking,  capital  markets,  and  insurance  sectors.  The  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), in recognition of the growing significance of Islamic finance among \nits developing member countries, joined the IFSB as an observer in 2003 and became an \nassociate member in 2006. ADB\u2019s regional technical assistance (TA) for the Development of \nInternational Prudential Standards for Islamic Financial Services,1 which was cofinanced by Islamic \nDevelopment  Bank  (IDB),  provided  support  to  the  IFSB.  Specifically,  ADB  and  IFSB \ncollaborated to develop a set of international prudential standards for the supervision of Islamic \nfinancial services. Building upon this partnership and accomplishments of the aforementioned \nTA, it is proposed to continue ADB support for Islamic financing. The focus is to be on further \nenhancing prudential and supervision standards, as well as on various measures needed for \neffective implementation.2 This undertaking would deepen the broader partnership with IDB, \nincluding to develop an institutional infrastructure for a more effective use of Islamic finance \namong the common member countries.3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since the mid-1970s, when there were few Islamic banks, Islamic finance has grown \nrapidly (at an estimated average annual rate of 10% to 15%) both globally and in the region. As \na result, there is now a proliferation of Islamic institutions and a trend toward mainstreaming \nwith  interest-based  conventional  finance.  There  are  currently  approximately  400  Islamic \nfinancial institutions throughout 53 countries,4 some of which are global players and offer an \nextensive range of Shari\u2019ah (Islamic law) compliant products (money, debt, and capital market) \nand services to a broad spectrum of consumers and businesses. There is also an increasing \ndemand  for  diversifying  Shari\u2019ah-compliant  financial  products  and  services.  While  Islamic \nfinance has historically concentrated on commercial banking, potential areas for future growth \ntoday include investment banking, asset management, capital markets, and private banking. \nWith approximately 1.5 billion Muslims in the world, and increasing interest among non-Muslims \nfor alternative financing modes and investments, the potential for growth of Islamic financial \nmarkets  worldwide  is  vast.  Current  global  Islamic  banking  assets  and  assets  under \nmanagement have reached $750 billion and is expected to exceed $1 trillion by 2010.5 That \nwould be about five times what they were in 2002. The year 2007, in particular, saw exceptional \ngrowth in the global sukuk (Islamic securities) market, which expanded by more than 70% \nduring the year. New issues in 2007 reached a record high of about $47 billion, and the \noutstanding global sukuk market has now surpassed the $100 billion mark.6  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for the Development of International Prudential Standards for Islamic Financial \nServices. Manila (TA 6182-REG, for $400,000). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 April 2008. \n3  The common member countries include: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, \nKazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Malaysia, Maldives, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. For \nthe purpose of this TA, and based on consultation with relevant stakeholders, a main focus on the Southeast Asian \ncountries has been recommended. \n4  Association of Islamic Banking Institutions, Malaysia. \n5  McKinsey & Company. 2007. The World Islamic Banking Competitiveness Report 2007-08: Capturing The Trillion \nDollar Opportunity. Manama. \n6  Bank Negara Malaysia. 2008. Governor's Opening Remarks at the Malaysian Islamic Finance 2008 Issuers and \nInvestors Forum - 11th August 2008 Kuala Lumpur (available: www.bnm.gov.my). \n ", "2 \n3.  In Southeast Asia, there is a growing demand for Islamic finance products and markets \nin Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. Malaysia has long played \na leading role in developing Islamic finance and often acts as a benchmark for many in the \nregion. In particular, Malaysia is the world\u2019s largest sukuk issuance center, with over $25 billion, \nor 53%, of the world\u2019s sukuk issues in 2007. According to an Islamic Finance Information \nService report, Southeast Asia (and specifically Malaysia) continues to offer the most accessible \nmarkets for small and medium-sized borrowers. Fifty-five of the sukuk issued in Southeast Asia \nduring 2007 have each been worth between $1 million and $10 million, whereas not a single \nsukuk in other regions has fallen within that range.7 Indonesia has also made several notable \nimprovements in its regulatory and legal provisions. Among them, it passed a new Islamic \nbanking law in May 2008 that will allow commercial banks to be converted into Shari\u2019ah-\ncompliant ones and for foreign entities to set up Islamic banks in cooperation with Indonesian \npartners. In July 2008, the Indonesian parliament approved the issuance of government sukuk \nworth $2 billion. Many see this as a strong indication of the administration\u2019s increased attention \nto developing Shari\u2019ah finance.8 In Singapore, the Monetary Authority of Singapore aims to play \na complementary role by adding Shari\u2019ah-compliant products to the broad range of financial \nservices  offered  by  the  country\u2019s  financial  institutions. To  this  end,  the  Monetary  Authority \nannounced in May 2008 that it is developing a facility to make available Singapore dollar-\ndenominated, sovereign-rated sukuk to financial institutions in Singapore conducting Islamic \nfinance. In addition, a 5% concessionary tax rate has been granted for income derived from \nShari\u2019ah-compliant fund management, lending, insurance, and re-insurance.9  \n \n4.  The  efforts  in  the  region  to  develop  Islamic  finance  have  prepared  an  enabling \nenvironment for ADB further to spur the growth of Islamic finance. By enhancing regional \nfinancial integration and contributing to managing capital inflows into the region, these efforts \nshould contribute to regional financial market stability. In this context, ADB\u2019s Office of the \nGeneral Counsel formed an internal working group on Islamic finance to better coordinate ADB \nactivities  in  this  area  and  developed  a  short  background  paper  on  Islamic  finance  with \nrecommendations to enhance ADB support. ADB\u2019s Office of Regional Economic Integration \nincludes  a  section  in  AsianBondsOnline  on  Islamic  finance,  which  provides  information \nregarding Islamic finance market infrastructure, rules and regulations, as well as updates on \nIslamic finance activities and data in the region. In September 2008, ADB\u2019s Private Sector \nOperations Department signed with IDB a landmark cofinancing agreement that will allow the \ntwo banks to work together on projects in common member countries. ADB and IDB will provide \nup to $2 billion equivalent, respectively, over the next 3 years to finance projects in common \nmember countries.10 \n \n5.  Most  countries  have  separate  conventional  and  Islamic  banks,  but  others  allow \nconventional banks to set up Islamic windows. Despite the potential and improvements to date, \nthe regulatory and supervision framework, markets, and instruments still suffer from significant \ngaps. In consequence, the Islamic finance industry has highlighted that one of the biggest \nchallenges facing its integration into the global financial system is to harmonize standards as \nneeded to sustain its continued rapid growth. TA for the Development of International Prudential \nStandards for Islamic Financial Services was a landmark project that resulted in IFSB\u2019s adopting \na new transparency and market discipline standard, new compilation guidelines for collecting \nIslamic finance statistics, identification and initial analysis of key issues and gaps in Islamic \n                                                 \n7  Islamic Finance Information Service. 2008. Sukuk in 2007: Key Trends and Market Highlights. London. \n8  Islamic Finance, August/September 2008. \n9 U21Global. 2008. Islamic Finance: Growth and Prospects in Singapore. Singapore (Working Paper No. 001/2008). \n10 In this context, the Southeast Asia Department has historically had the responsibility within ADB for the lead role in \ndevelopment of Islamic regulation and supervision standards for the financial sector. \n ", "         3 \nfinance  regulation  and  supervision,  and  recommendations  for  strengthening  the  legal  and \nregulatory framework for Islamic asset securitization as a basis for developing Islamic capital \nmarkets. This work also complemented that already ongoing to design prudential standards for \nIslamic finance in the areas of capital adequacy, supervisory review, and risk management. It \nalso helped provide Basel II equivalent standards and guidelines for Islamic finance.  \n \n6.  Accordingly, the key immediate challenges going forward are apparent. First, there is a \nclear need to implement the new standards and compilation guidelines11 at the country level, as \nwell as to further develop and clarify the recommendations on a legal and regulatory framework \nfor asset securitization prior to its adoption by IFSB as a guideline. Also needed is to effectively \nimplement the strategies for developing Islamic money and government securities markets, as \nwell as to review experiences as implementation progress. In regard to developing money and \ngovernment securities markets, it should be noted that the IFSB has received assistance from \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF). A study from the IMF noted that there are important \nareas for further development, including to develop capital markets based on Islamic finance \ninstruments. These would include markets for sovereign sukuk issues as part of public debt and \nfinancing arrangements at country level. The issue of developing sukuk markets has assumed \nparticular importance because of the growing demand for infrastructure financing (for which \nIslamic finance is particularly suited) and the parallel growth in demand for sukuk in the Middle \nEast and in Southeast Asia.   \n \n7.   Based on the above, and to further support Islamic finance\u2019s development to meet its \npotential, a number of activities are also required in the medium term. First, continued efforts \nare needed toward mutual recognition and harmonization of standards within the context of \nemerging global standards being developed by IFSB. Second, support is needed to help the \npolicymakers and regulators to ensure that market infrastructure is fully developed. Third, active \nparticipation of private sector representatives is required for the industry\u2019s development. Finally, \nfurther  policy  support  and  assessments  of  binding  constraints  are  needed  so  that  Islamic \nfinancing  can  better  fulfill  its  mandate  to  support  economic  development  of  the  relevant \ncountries. It is expected that this will require two to three additional TA projects over a 5-year \nmedium-term framework. This will be undertaken with a view toward deepening and widening \npartnerships with such key Islamic finance partners as IFSB, IDB, and others.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the proposed TA is greater harmonization and broader mutual recognition \nin Islamic financial markets, and in the Southeast Asian region, through the establishment of \ninternational  prudential  standards  for  Islamic  banks  and  financial  institutions,  an  effective \nregulatory and supervisory framework, and a robust legal and liquidity infrastructure needed for \nthe sound development of Islamic finance. The outcome of the TA will be selected IFSB and \nADB member countries taking actions to harmonize prudential standards, data collection, and \ncommercial risk measurement. The TA has been coordinated with, and will complement, the \nwork undertaken by ADB\u2019s Office of Regional Economic Integration in Southeast Asia.  \n \n                                                 \n11 The standards currently issued by the IFSB include Capital Adequacy (2005), Risk Management (2005), Corporate \nGovernance (2006), Transparency & Market Discipline through Disclosure (2007), and Supervisory Review Process (2007). ", "4 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will be conducted in consultation and coordination with IFSB staff and members, \nincluding IDB, IMF, World Bank, and the Bank for International Settlements. IFSB, through its \ntechnical committees and working groups, will continue to provide a forum for discussing key \nissues  in  developing  international  standards.  ADB  and  IDB  in  cooperation  with  IFSB  will \ncoordinate closely with other multilateral and bilateral donors, including the IMF, World Bank, \nand Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative for strategically utilizing resources and \nsequencing assistance. Aspects of the TA will address issues in developing Islamic money and \ncapital  markets.  Following  the  adoption  of  major  IFSB  standards,  guidelines,  and  strategy \ndocuments, the next step will focus in particular on facilitating their implementation. This TA \naims  to  facilitate  implementation  of  the  standards,  guidelines,  and  market  development \nstrategies. The key TA activities include the following: \n(i)  Help IFSB develop legal and liquidity infrastructure needed for Islamic finance\u2019s \nsound development and effective supervision. As a part of efforts to develop liquidity \ninfrastructure, specific aspects of the strategy for Islamic money and government \nsecurities markets will be worked out in detail, including guidance on qualitative and \nquantitative  benchmarks  for  regulatory  requirements  and  the  supervisory \nassessment  of  liquidity  risk  management.  To  strengthen  the  legal  infrastructure, \ncertain key legal Shari`ah issues in Islamic asset securitization will be addressed.12 \n(ii)  Support IFSB in working out strategies for Islamic capital market development in \ncoordination  with  IFSB\u2019s  ongoing  work  on  liquidity  infrastructure.  The  work  will \ninclude  measures  to  strengthen  sovereign  sukuk  issues  in  domestic  markets, \nintegrate  sukuk  issuance  in  the  overall  public  debt  and  financing  management \nframework, and develop active and well-regulated secondary markets for sukuk. \n(iii)  Assist IFSB in preparing a diagnostic study in the area of interface between positive \nlaws and the Shari\u2019ah across all types of Shari\u2019ah-compliant asset securitization \ncontracts. This shall include a platform to engage legal jurists and Shari\u2019ah scholars \nto find solutions for complex legal and Shari\u2019ah issues through advanced sharing of \njurisprudential thoughts and methodologies.  \n(iv)  Help IFSB provide further education on the IFSB standards and guidelines through \ncase studies and workshops to facilitate implementation of the standards. \n(v)  Assist IFSB in continuing the efforts to compile prudential and structural Islamic \nfinance indicators based on the compilation guide already developed. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  Total cost of the TA is estimated at $850,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $425,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis from its TA funding program (Technical Assistance Special Fund\u2014\nother sources) and $425,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by IFSB. The IFSB \ncontributions will be administered by ADB. The funds will cover remuneration, travel, and per \ndiem  for  international  consultants  and  resource  persons,  as  well  as  conference-related \nexpenditures,  participants\u2019  travel  costs,  other  training  expenditures,  and  miscellaneous \nexpenses to gather views on the feasibility of the TA\u2019s proposals, disseminate its findings, and \nfacilitate agreement on new initiatives and actions. The detailed cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. No activity will be financed in any member country under this TA unless \n                                                 \n12 To illustrate, standard acceptable practice has yet to be agreed to appropriately define several basic financial law \nconcepts, including default, amortization, unearned profits, legal and/or beneficial title, and insolvency, while duly \nconsidering both the legal and Shar\u012b\u2019ah elements that govern the Shari\u2019ah-compliant asset securitization contracts.  \n ", "         5 \nand until a letter of no objection, if needed, in respect of such activity has been received from \nthe government of such member country.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA, while the Implementing Agency will be \nIFSB. Public workshops will be held in IFSB countries to disseminate information and the TA\u2019s \nfindings on Islamic finance. The workshops will include all participating countries and agencies, \nas well as interested public and private sector parties. IFSB will maintain a public database on \nthe industry with free international access to promote a better international understanding and \nassessment  of  Islamic  financial  markets.  Review  of  the  TA  will  be  provided  through  ADB \nmissions, regular communications with IFSB, and standard reports (inception, midterm, and \nfinal). The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from March 2009 to February 2011.  \n \n12.  ADB will recruit a firm to provide international consulting services. The TA will finance \nthe services of 30 person-months of international consulting services to be implemented over a \nperiod of 24 months with activities expected to commence in March 2009. The international \nconsultants will include a senior Islamic finance supervisory and regulatory expert who will also \nbe  the  project  coordinator,  a  senior  financial  sector  and  statistical  expert,  senior  financial \nsupervision and training expert, a senior legal expert, senior money and government securities \nmarket expert, and a senior Islamic capital market and tax expert. The consultants will be \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Single-source selection of international consultants will be used, \ntaking into consideration especially (i) the natural continuation of work in relation to the TA for \nthe Development of International Prudential Standards for Islamic Financial Services: Development \nof International Prudential Standards for Islamic Financial Services carried out successfully by \nthe consulting firm from July 2005 to March 2007, (ii) the consulting firm\u2019s successful experience \nin managing and forging cross-country collaboration among national entities under the TA, and \n(iii) the highly specialized nature of many of the assignments. The consulting firm will be \nselected through biodata technical proposal.

Application of DCR requires Islamic banking \ninstitutions to allocate adequate capital to cover credit and market risks exposures arising from the assets funded by \nthe profit-sharing investment account, which would otherwise be absorbed by the investment account holders. This \nmeasurement of additional risk borne by the Islamic banking institutions arising from the application of DCR is \nrepresented by alpha (a), which quantifies the risk to be absorbed by the Islamic banking institutions for the purpose \nof the risk-weighted capital ratio calculation under the capital adequacy framework. \n \n \n   \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n \n  Total \nItem  Cost \nA.
