THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will support the preparation of ensuing \nregional  infrastructure  and  connectivity  projects  in  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) and the Caucasus region during 2021\u20132023. \n \n2.  The  transaction  TA  facility  will  enhance  the  ensuing  regional  infrastructure  and \nconnectivity projects by (i) reducing TA processing time, thus making project preparation more \nefficient, (ii) using the CAREC Program platform to strengthen multi-country coordination, (iii) \nmaximizing the regional cooperation and integration (RCI) design elements and impacts of these \nprojects, and (iv) further boosting the abilities of the CAREC and Caucasus region developing \nmember countries (DMCs) to plan and prepare effective RCI operations in the future. \n \n3.  Regional infrastructure financing  challenges. The DMCs in the CAREC and the \nCaucasus  region  face  significant  infrastructure  financing  gaps.  With  the  exclusion  of  the \ncomparatively stronger position of the People\u2019s Republic of China, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) estimates the infrastructure gap for the CAREC member countries at $1.15 trillion at 2015 \nprices over the 2016\u20132030 period or at $76.80 billion per year.1  It is generally more challenging \nto develop and implement the regional infrastructure projects needed to fill this gap than the purely \ndomestic ones. Regional designs are more complex, the political risks are more significant and \nnumerous, and the full buy-in and cooperation of the countries involved is imperative. Mobilizing \nthe necessary financing becomes more difficult as a result, particularly when private sector \nparticipation is essential. \n \n4.  Obstacles to regional coordination. Regional infrastructure projects involve the same \ndifficulties faced by other development efforts of regional scale or with regional benefits. Their \nimpact  will  be  diminished  without  smooth  coordination  between  multiple  countries  and \nstakeholders. Project designs must align with each participating DMC's regional and national \nstrategies, policies, and support mechanisms. Failure to establish effective means for such \ncoordination due to insufficient awareness, resources, and formal communication channels can \ndelay a project\u2019s completion or impair its outcome.  \n \n5.  Offsetting  benefits.  The  resulting  regional  benefits  counterbalance  the  project \npreparation challenges for regional projects. Participating DMCs can gain access to international \nindustrial and agricultural value chains and benefit from regional public goods.  Regional projects \nbroaden economic growth for all the DMC partners and across all sectors. Regional transport, \nenergy, and cross-border cooperation projects can (i) generate secondary- and tertiary-level \nprojects in various sectors such as energy, transport, health, tourism, urban, and trade sectors, \n(ii) trigger additional domestic investment, and (iii) promote greater participation of a diverse array \nof development and finance stakeholders. \n \n6.  Delivering solutions. The TA facility will address challenges in the project preparation, \nregional coordination, design, overall financing, and other issues in the proposed ensuing Central \nand West Asia Department (CWRD) regional infrastructure projects detailed in Table 1. These \nprojects will help improve connectivity, build climate change resilience, and promote digital \ninfrastructure  in  the  CAREC  and  Caucasus  region.  The  TA  facility  will  contribute  to  RCI \ninnovations, especially in sector diversification (e.g., regional tourism development) and private \n \n1  ADB. 2017. Meeting Asia\u2019s Infrastructure Needs. Manila. \n \n  ", "2   \nsector participation in RCI, maximizing the RCI impact under various CAREC regional sector \nstrategies supported by regional TAs.2 The TA facility will provide advantages in collaborative \nsolution development during the preparation of the two proposed projects and any future regional \ninfrastructure interventions identified as suitable candidates for facility support.  \n \n7.  A TA facility is especially suited to (i) help effective mobilization of RCI resources across \ndifferent sectors; (ii) serve as a platform for accumulating and disseminating knowledge in the \ndesign,  financing,  and  implementation  of  regional  infrastructure  projects;  and  (iii)  enable \nmultisector collaboration within ADB and CWRD to optimize the RCI design and maximize the \nRCI impact of regional infrastructure projects. The selection of the ensuing projects  to be \nsupported by the TA facility is based on the (i) regional nature of the project and its ability to create \ncross-border synergies in multiple countries (e.g. involvement of at least two or more CAREC and \nthe Caucasus region DMCs; or high regional spillover impact to neighboring countries for projects \ncovering a single country); (ii) compliance to sustainable infrastructure development principles \nsuch as the Group of Twenty (G20) Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment; and (iii) \ndegree of scalability and replicability of similar projects across the region.  \n \nTable 1: Proposed Ensuing Projects \nProposed Project Title  Description \nProject 1. Kyrgyz Republic:  The project will (i) improve public health and environmental conditions; (ii) \nThe Issyk-Kul  enhance  livability;  and  (iii)  boost  sustainable  tourism  and  economic \nEnvironmental  development  through  integrated  planning,  institutional  support,  and \nManagement for  strategic investments for the overall Issyk-Kul Lake area and in the ABECa  \nSustainable Tourism  region. It is aligned with the CAREC Strategy 2030,b and the CAREC \nDevelopment Project  Program\u2019s promotion of tourism within the region under the CAREC \nTourism Strategy 2030.c It will support the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s plan to \nProcessing Division:  develop tourism under the ABEC Tourism Master Plan.d It will promote \nCWUW, CWRD  innovation by adopting digital infrastructure and pursue gender-inclusive \n  tourism by adopting gender-sensitive design such as gender-sensitive \nProposed gender  sanitation facilities. The project is listed in ADB\u2019s COBP for the Kyrgyz \ncategorization: EGM  Republic, 2021\u20132023e and the ICPM 2022-2024 for the Kyrgyz Republic. \nProject 2. Kyrgyz Republic:  The proposed project will improve the road network's performance and \nRoad Network Climate and  climate and disaster resilience in the Kyrgyz Republic, including the \nDisaster Resilience  Bishkek\u2013Torugart road, which is part of the CAREC Corridor 1 linking the \nImprovement Project   Kyrgyz Republic with the PRC and other CAREC countries. It will support \n  the repair and construction of crucial structures such as bridges, galleries, \nProcessing Division:  and tunnels with improvements in gender-sensitive facilities. The project \nCWTC, CWRD  is aligned with the CAREC Strategy 2030 operational clusters of (i) trade, \n  tourism, and economic corridors; and (ii) infrastructure and economic \nProposed gender  connectivity. The project is listed in the ICPM 2022-2024 for the Kyrgyz \ncategorization: EGM  Republic.  \nABEC = Almaty-Bishkek Economic Corridor, ADB = Asian Development Bank, CAREC = Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation Department, COBP = country operations business plan, CWRD = Central and West Asia \nDepartment, CWTC = Transport and Communications Division, CWUW = Urban Development and Water Division, \nEGM = effective gender mainstreaming, ICPM = indicative country pipeline and monitoring, PRC = People\u2019s Republic \nof China. \na The Almaty\u2013Bishkek Economic Corridor is a pilot cross-border economic corridor around Almaty and Bishkek under \nthe CAREC program.

Applying lessons learned. The TA facility incorporates essential findings of the midterm \nreview of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.3 This includes the review\u2019s recommendations for ADB to better \noptimize and prioritize its resource use and TA resource allocation, improve the quality of project \ndesigns, reduce delays in project implementation, promote cost-efficiency in the procurement of \nservices, maximize the value addition provided by consultant services, and achieve greater cost-\neffectiveness in project administration. Key lessons and recommendations from the thematic \nevaluation study4 and project completion reports on regional infrastructure development prepared \nby ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department5 will also be applied\u2014i.e., more effective use of \nRCI platforms such as CAREC to advance regional infrastructure development; a concerted \nemphasis on good early planning and cross-country coordination; and recognition that securing \nsufficient funding during project preparation is important to its economic viability. The TA facility \nwill focus on improving the capacity of DMCs in project design, preparation, and sequencing at \nregional level and support multi-country and inter-agency coordination. \n \n9.  Linkage with ADB Strategies. The TA facility will foster RCI, a prominent theme and one \nof the identified key operational priorities (operational priority [OP] 7) under ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.6 \nThe TA facility is closely aligned with pillar 1 and pillar 2 of OP7 supporting higher-quality \ninfrastructure  connectivity  between  economies  by  improving  transport  and  information  and \ncommunications  technology    connectivity  and  efficiency  of  cross-border  connectivity;  and \nfacilitating cross-border economic corridor development, including regional tourism development.  \nIt will also address OP2 (accelerating progress in gender equality)7 by promoting women\u2019s \neconomic empowerment. The TA facility also supports advancing the regional infrastructure \nagenda for reliable and sustainable infrastructure under operational cluster 3 (infrastructure and \nconnectivity) and operational cluster 2 (trade, tourism and economic corridor cluster) of the \nCAREC 2030 Strategic Framework8 and the CAREC Transport Strategy 2030.9  \n \nB.
