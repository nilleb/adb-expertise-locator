The Government of Tajikistan (the Government) is considering pursuing the option of \ncommunity-managed micro-hydropower to meet the wide energy supply gap during the winter in \nremote villages. It requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to carry out a technical \nassistance (TA) to identify micro-hydropower projects in remote rural areas and involve rural \ncommunities in management of rural utility power services.  The TA was included in ADB\u2019s 2004 \nTA program, 1  and will complement the earlier ADB TA2 for developing a hydropower strategy \nfor Tajikistan. The proposal was endorsed for funding by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation \nFund in March 2004. The Fact-Finding Mission in May 2004 reached an understanding with the \nGovernment  on  the  goals,  purpose,  scope,  approach,  cost  estimates,  implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services for the TA. The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Despite  the  high  capital  investment  involved,  many  remote  rural  communities  in \nTajikistan were connected to the main electricity grid under the former Soviet regime. Nearly all \nthe power is generated by hydropower projects fed by glacial water. These have a lower output \nin winter. The whole electricity system (generation, transmission, and distribution) in Tajikistan is \nvery  old  and  significant  investment  is  needed  for  rehabilitation  and  modernization.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  focus  is  on  modernization  of  existing  energy  infrastructure  for  industry  and \ncommercial use, and on the overall national need to attract foreign investment. Meanwhile, the \nelectricity supply in remote rural areas is deteriorating. There is little electricity supply in winter \nwhen communities\u2019 become very vulnerable. Households, especially women and children, resort \nto using wood fires and kerosene for heating, cooking, and lighting, which cause respiratory \ndiseases, and the natural environment is also damaged due to uncontrolled deforestation. The \nGovernment identified increasing access of the poor to electricity as one of the main issues in \nits poverty reduction strategy paper in 2002. So, in order to maintain the livelihoods of remote \nrural communities as well as the natural environment, consumers in remote areas\u2014where most \nof the poor live\u2014need to be included in the direct benefits of the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s \nenergy sector strategy. \n \n3.  The ADB Country Strategy and Program (CSP), 2004\u201320083 for Tajikistan focuses on \nintegrated rural development. Energy services constitute a key building block for successful, \nintegrated rural development. Off-grid electricity\u2014despite relatively higher generation costs\u2014is \na viable alternative to supplement the existing unreliable supply. Because of the mountainous \ntopography, run-of-river micro-hydropower generation tends to be the least-cost solution for \nproviding additional electricity supplies to remote communities. Further, it is a solution based on \nlocal resources with minimal environmental impact and no combustion emissions. Tajikistan has \nvery few fossil fuels, such as oil, natural gas, or coal, and relies on imports from Uzbekistan and \nKazakhstan. People in remote areas resorted to cutting down trees and bushes for use as fuel \nafter coal and gas supplies became unreliable with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. \nOther renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar power, are likely to have a higher \nlife-period cost as the region lacks an appropriate maintenance system.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the Internet edition of ADB Business Opportunities in May 2004. \n2  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to Tajikistan for the Hydropower Development Strategy Project. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program 2004-2008: Tajikistan. Manila. \n ", "2  \n4.  Poor people often use inefficient appliances that are inexpensive to buy but consume \nmore electricity. People living in remote areas have not yet been introduced to efficient and \nmodern appliances, such as neon and compact florescent lights, convective space heaters, and \nelectric blankets. They can be assisted in making informed buying decisions. Use of efficient \nappliances  will  also  extend  electricity  supplies  to  more  consumers  with  the  same  power \ngeneration capacity. \n \n5.  Barki Tajik, the state-owned electricity company, is responsible for management of the \npower sector and supply of electricity to all consumers. Its attention is at present focused on \nrehabilitation and modernization of the main grid system for urban centers; the problems of \nremote areas remain unresolved.4 The micro and small hydropower projects are viable options \nfor power supply in the remote regions of Gorno Badakhshan Autonomous Region.5 Field \ninspections revealed that well-designed projects with proper equipment are being successfully \noperated by local people; however, a subsidy for the capital costs and the participation of the \nlocal community were essential for sustainability. Local communities can be encouraged to be \ninvolved in project design, implementation, and subsequently, the supply of electricity in remote \nareas,  mainly  because  (i) micro-hydropower  equipment  is  simple6 and  a  large  part  of  the \npopulation possesses the necessary skills as they worked in factories under the Soviet system, \nand  (ii) community-based  water  management  systems  are  already  functioning.  Further, \ncommunity participation can also increase income-generating activities that are made possible \nby more reliable power supply. However, there is a need to prepare simple business models \nthat village residents can appreciate and get fully involved in, and later develop partnerships \nwith other agencies in terms of credit and marketing facilities.  \n \n6.  The implementation of the two proposed pilot projects will support the Government\u2019s \ndevelopment effort to poor households that have either an unreliable electricity supply or no \nsupply at all in winter. Lessons learnt in hydropower sector and past-related donors and ADB \nprojects7 have been taken into account in the preparation of the TA. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n7.  The purpose of the TA is to improve utility power services in remote rural areas in winter.  \n \n8.  The TA will be divided into two distinct phases and the implementation of Phase 2 will \ndepend  on  a  satisfactory  output  of  Phase  1.  The  expected  outputs  of  Phase  1  are: \n(i) identification of two sites suitable for pilot hydropower generation and assessment of project \nfeasibility,  (ii) identification  of  community  organizations  that  are  motivated  and  capable  of \nmanaging  and  owning  a  micro-hydropower  project,  and  (iii) preparation  of  an  appropriate \norganization framework for providing the utility power services. The Department for International \n                                                 \n4   The Islamic Development Bank approved a $10 million loan in February 2004 for the rehabilitation of five small \nhydropower stations in remote areas. \n5   R.

The micro-hydropower machine is designed to \nlast about four times as long as a car but requires about a fourth of the skills to keep it operating. \n7  Smail Khennas and Andrew Barnett. 2000.

Manila. \n \n ", "  3\nDevelopment will assess the Phase 1 report along with ADB\u2019s recommendation to determine the \nfunding for Phase 2. The expected outputs of Phase 2 are (i) establishment of two viable \ncommunity-based  energy  organizations,  (ii) implementation  of  two  pilot  micro-hydropower \nprojects and strengthening of distribution networks, (iii) supply of energy in pilot project areas, \n(iv) greater awareness of energy saving in pilot project areas, and (v) creation of partnerships \nwith  other  agencies  for  income-generating  activities.  Taking  account  of  other  development \npartner activities and local needs, the Government has indicated several possible pilot project \nsites: one project may be located in Tajikabad, about 240 kilometers (km) from Dushanbe, and \nthe second in one of the following possible locations: Faisalabad, Gar, Jerakabad, Liakso, or \nNurabad. Each micro-hydropower project would have a capacity of 50\u2013100 kilowatt (kW) and \nwould supply electricity to approximately 1,500 households.8 \n \n9.  The outcomes of the TA will be disseminated by publications, workshops, and ADB web \nsite. The TA will evaluate the pilot projects and define the critical factors needed to replicate \ntheir success in other locations. It will develop training programs to build the capacity of the \nGovernment and the Ministry of Energy, to (i) ensure continuing policy support and removal of \nany institutional and regulatory barriers to scaling up the community-based micro-hydropower \nprojects, and (ii) establish community-based organizations to install and operate the utility power \nservices.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  participation  of  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders  is  essential  for  this  TA.  Such \nparticipation, including the poorest people and vulnerable groups like households headed by \nfemales, the elderly, or disabled, and indigenous people, will directly contribute to the success \nof the TA. The community will participate throughout the project cycle and will help make \ndecisions. The TA will also create an enabling environment for micro-hydropower generation by \nimproving the existing legal and regulatory framework. The TA will seek continual support of \ngovernment agencies and will initiate dialogue to adopt a community-based micro-hydropower \nstrategy in the energy sector policy. Budget allocation will be sought for its replication.  \n \n11.  Information sharing is another important principle in this TA. Information on project \ndesign, organization framework, and community participation will be shared through formal and \ninformal meetings, conferences, and the media, depending on who the target audience is. \n \n12.  Phase 1 (3 months). The following outputs will be available after Phase 1: \n \n(i)  Hydrologic  and  geologic  feasibility  study.  The  study  will  examine  local \nhydrologic statistics and geologic stability (landslides, etc.) for the pilot project \nsites proposed by the Government and will determine project feasibility. \n(ii)  Social feasibility study. The study will identify functioning community-based \norganizations for owning and managing the pilot projects, taking into account the \ncommunities\u2019 willingness and keenness to own the project, and their willingness \nto pay for the utility power services. In parallel, various surveys and analyses will \nbe carried out at these sites, such as stakeholder analysis, gender analysis,  \n                                                 \n8  According to the Ministry of Energy, the average cost of fully installed units is $600\u2013800 per kW for Russian \nequipment. Equipment made in Pakistan or the People\u2019s Republic of China would cost less. The view of the \nexperts of the Aga Khan Foundation in Dushanbe is that prices are even lower. \n ", "4  \na socioeconomic survey, a household energy survey,9 field surveys to comply \nwith ADB\u2019s safeguard issues, analysis of opportunities and risks for income-\ngenerating activities, and identification of other agencies that would be interested \nin partnering. \n \n(iii)  Pilot project technical design. The study will carry out the technical design and \neconomic feasibility study, including detailed cost estimates, contract packaging, \nand  time  scheduling  for  implementation  of  the  selected  pilot  projects  under \nactivity (i). \n \n13.  Phase 2 (12 months). The following activities will be carried out in Phase 2: \n \n(i)  Institution building. First, the basic rules of the community-based organization \nwill be prepared by the community members with assistance from government \nagencies and consultant. The rules will cover areas like the organization, by-\nlaws, appointment of executives, tariffs, billing and collection method, project \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  customer  relations  management,  and  social  and \nenvironmental monitoring mechanisms and criteria. Simultaneously, the basic \nskills for operation and maintenance will be provided by Barki Tajik and the \nconsultant. Second, the detailed design of the pilot projects (including tender \ndocuments) will be prepared. The community members need to understand the \nproject implementation plan, which will increase the ownership and transparency \nof the project. Third, an action plan for an awareness campaign on energy saving \nwill  be  formulated  for  key  stakeholders,  such  as  community  members,  local \nNGOs, local governmental agencies, media, and local social organizations.  \n \n(ii)  Implementation  of  pilot  projects  (micro-hydropower  and  distribution \nnetworks). This will include procurement, installation, and operation of the two \npilot micro-hydropower projects, and strengthening of the distribution networks in \nthe project areas. The work will be shared by community members, and assisted \nby government agencies and consultants. On-the-job operation and maintenance \ntraining  will  be  provided  to  community  members.  In  parallel,  an  awareness \ncampaign on energy saving will be carried out by the concerned stakeholders \naccording to the action plan in (i) above. \n \n(iii)  Implementation  of  pilot  project  (income-generating  activities).  Outline \nbusiness plans will be prepared by community members with assistance from \nlocal  government  agencies  and  consultants.  Based  on  these  plans,  the \ncommunity-based organization, with assistance from the government consultant, \nwill  seek  partnerships  with  other  agencies  in  the  region  to  acquire  related \nservices, such as microfinance and marketing.  \n \n(iv)  Pilot project monitoring and evaluation, and replication. After TA completion, \nthe  pilot  project  evaluation  will  be  carried  out  in  a  participatory  manner.  All \nstakeholders will share their concerns, on both the positive and negative aspects \nof the project, and suggest ways to further improve the quality of the project. \n                                                 \n9   Questions will include: (i) What types of energy are used for different purposes? (to understand the substitution \neffect); (ii) What portion of the household\u2019s income is spent on energy? (to understand trade-offs); (iii) What are \nthe coping strategies in the face of unreliable energy supply, or the impact of large price increases? (to understand \nenergy conservation possibilities).  \n \n ", "  5\nLessons  learned  will  be  documented  to  help  in  the  design  of  future  similar \nprojects.  Besides  this  activity,  community  based  organizations  will  conduct \nperiodic ex-post project monitoring as a part of customer relations management. \nThey will look into not only technical, organizational, and financial aspects, but \nalso  social  aspects  like  the  impacts  of  the  project  on  the  life  of  community \nmembers. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  $1,000,000  equivalent,  including  a  foreign  exchange \ncomponent  of  $563,000  and  a  local  currency  component  of  $437,000  equivalent.  The \nGovernment has requested ADB to finance $800,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign \nexchange cost and $237,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance \nthe balance of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Poverty \nReduction Cooperation Fund. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are presented in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The TA will require 131 person-months of consulting services: 11 person-months of \ninternational consultants, and 120 person-months of domestic consultants, including NGOs. The \nconsulting team, to be recruited through a firm, will comprise hydropower, economics, financial, \nenvironmental, social development, and legal specialists. All consultants will be selected and \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  selecting  and  engaging  domestic  consultants.  \nAll procurement of goods and works under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. Goods will be procured under international shopping arrangements and works \nwill be procured under local competitive bidding procedures. \n \n16.  The Ministry of Energy will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The village organization \nor the local administrative body at the pilot project sites will be the implementing agencies. The \nExecuting Agency will assign a project leader and counterpart staff, and monitor the domestic \nconsultants\u2019 work in close coordination with ADB. The TA will be implemented over 15 months \nstarting in January 2005 and ending in March 2006. Outline terms of reference for consulting \nservices are given in Appendix 3. \n \n \n17.  Involuntary Resettlement Issues. The pilot projects are each expected to have a small \namount of voluntary or involuntary land donation/acquisition for the powerhouse (of about 10 to \n15 square meters), intake water pipes, and few wooden poles for the distribution network. The \nconsultant will assist in dealing with any losses that arise.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to the Government \nof Tajikistan to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for \nDevelopment of Community  Based Micro-Hydropower  Supply in  Remote  Rural Areas, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6 Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance \nDesign Summary  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nIndicators/Targets \nGoal       \nImproved quality of life during  Average score of level of service  Community energy   \nthe winter in the remote rural  satisfaction and quality of life  organizations to conduct \nproject areas and  index is more than 3.5 on a scale  annual surveys during and \ndemonstration of community- of 5.  after the TA implementation \nbased micro-hydropower as a    period.
