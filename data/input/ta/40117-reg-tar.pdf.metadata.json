Bilateral and subregional free trade agreements (FTA) increasingly are becoming major \nvehicles of trade policy and diplomacy among Asian developing member countries. However, \nlittle is known about (i) the impact of FTAs on business, (ii) the process of FTA negotiations, (iii) \nthe economic effects of alternative FTA arrangements, and (iv) best practices in FTA design and \nnegotiations. These issues lie at the center of economic policy debates in Asia on how to make \nFTAs stepping stones\u2014rather than stumbling blocks\u2014to multilateral liberalization through the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) process. In this vein, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) President Kuroda, and other eminent persons have articulated \na  vision  of  consolidating  and  deepening  bilateral/subregional  FTAs  into  an  Asia-wide  FTA \ncovering all the major Asian economies.1 \n \n2.  ADB has a solid track record in promoting regional cooperation and integration (RCI) in \nAsia. In April 2005, ADB established the Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI) to \nfacilitate and coordinate bank-wide RCI activities, with a focus on trade and investment as well \nas money and finance. RCI is a priority area in the Second Medium-Term Strategy, and trade \nand investment is a pillar of the RCI strategy. To promote a better-informed policy dialogue \namong stakeholders on trade and investment, OREI will prepare a variety of studies on FTAs, \nincluding  (i)  a  study  of  the  impact  of  FTAs  on  business  activity,  (ii)  case  studies  of  FTA \nnegotiations, and (iii) a model-based study on the economic effects of FTAs. Further, OREI will \ndevelop a manual on designing and negotiating FTAs. This technical assistance (TA) paper \nreflects  the  purpose  and  output,  methodology  and  essential  activities,  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan, and implementation arrangements of this project.2 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Before  1998,  the  only  significant  regional  accord  in  Asia  was  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Free Trade Area. The number of FTAs in Asia has increased \ndramatically since the late 1990s, however. ADB estimates that more than 175 bilateral and \nsubregional FTAs have been signed or are being negotiated in Asia.4 East Asian economies, \nwhich are involved in 95 such agreements, have been the major driver of FTA formation in the \nregion.  \n \n4.  The coverage of trade and development issues in these agreements has deepened with \nthe rise of the so-called second generation FTAs, which include merchandise trade, as well as \nservices,  investment,  and  sensitive  issues  (e.g.,  intellectual  property  rights,  environmental \nstandards, competition policy, and public procurement). Second generation FTAs also provide \nlonger time frames for weaker countries to adjust.  \n \n5.  FTAs are spreading in Asia for four main reasons:5 (i) dissatisfaction with the slow \nprogress in global trade talks, (ii) defensive responses to activities of regional trading blocs \nelsewhere, (iii) the perception that international competitiveness and economies of scale can be \n                                                 \n1  See Prime Minister Singh. 2006. Welcome Address to the Opening Session of the Board of Governors. 39th Annual \nMeeting. Hyderabad, India (5 May).  \n2  The concept clearance was obtained in 3 October 2005. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 24 May 2006. \n4  Asia Regional Information Center FTA database, accessed 1 May 2006.  \n5  See Michael Plummer (forthcoming, 2006), Toward Win-Win Regionalism in Asia: Issues and Challenges in \nForming Efficient Trade Agreements in Asia. ADB Working Paper Series, No. 1. Manila: ADB.  ", "2   \nachieved through FTAs, and (iv) the belief that FTAs can support a deepening of market-led \nintegration in the region.   \n \n6.  The spread of FTAs in Asia has positive and negative economic aspects. On the positive \nside, with global trade talks progressing slowly, FTAs can (i) promote continuing liberalization, (ii) \ninduce structural reforms in the countries concerned, and (iii) widen market access across the \nregion.  Trade  arrangements  with  dynamic,  internationally  competitive  partners  also  can \nencourage the spread of efficient production practices.  \n \n7.  On the negative side, however, the formation of a large number of bilateral FTAs can \nlead  to  the  \u201cAsian  noodle  bowl  effect\u201d,  which  ADB  President  Kuroda  highlighted  following \nProfessor Bhagwati\u2019s initial observation of the \u201cspaghetti bowl effect\u201d.6 Multiple rules of origin \n(e.g.,  value-added  rules  or  changes  in  customs  classification)  arising  from  overlapping \nagreements  among  members  of  different  FTAs  can  have  harmful  effects.  Complex  rules \nincrease administrative and business costs, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, \nwhich  have  limited  capacity  to  deal  with  them.  Such  rules  also  can  deter  foreign  direct \ninvestment  and  trade.  Further,  the  demands  of  negotiating  multiple  trade  agreements \nincreasingly strain the scarce trade negotiation resources of many Asian countries, particularly \nthe least-developed countries (LDC), which have limited trade policy capacity.  \n \n8.  The dearth of high-quality, policy-oriented empirical studies on FTAs in Asia undermines \nthe ability of policy makers to map the net economic benefits of FTAs for Asian countries (and \nbusinesses within them), assess trade-offs between costs and benefits of FTAs, and formulate \nappropriate regional/national responses.  \n \n9.  A consensus is emerging among policy researchers that empirical studies are needed \non important aspects of the spread of FTAs in Asia, including (i) the effects of FTAs on business \nactivity;  (ii)  global  computable  general  equilibrium  (GCGE)  simulations  of  economy-wide \nimpacts  of  FTAs  (e.g.,  economic  welfare,  sectoral  impacts,  and  wages  of  alternative  FTA \nscenarios); and (iii) the process of formulating FTAs through negotiations.7 The consensus also \nsupports the need for identifying best practices in designing and negotiating FTAs to guide the \nprocess  of  forming  effective  FTAs  in  Asia  through  consolidation  and  deepening  of  trade \nagreements.  This  is  useful  for  ADB\u2019s  capacity  building  assistance  for  developing  member \ncountries. \n \n10.  In  line  with  ADB\u2019s  mandate  to  be  proactive  in  facilitating/promoting  regional \ncooperation/integration in the Asia and Pacific region, ADB should assess this important trend \nthrough a series of FTA studies, and identify the future actions required to maximize the net \neconomic benefit of these FTAs for member countries. The studies generated by this TA and \nthe workshops will enhance the quality of policy dialogue on the economic effects (including \npoverty reduction) and the future shape of FTAs in Asia. Policy dialogue among better-informed \nstakeholders is likely to facilitate faster trade and investment integration in Asia. In turn, this will \ncontribute to sustaining poverty reduction in the region through balanced or broad-based growth, \nemployment creation, and social sector expenditures. Thus, the region\u2019s trade and investment \nintegration and poverty reduction processes are intricately linked with each another. \n \n                                                 \n6  For a concise restatement, see Bhagwati, Jagdish. 2002. Free Trade Today. Princeton: Princeton University Press.  \n7  These areas are the outcome of consultations with academics and policy makers at the recent Brainstorming on \nFree Trade Agreements, held at ADB on 20 March 2006.  ", "    3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The intended impact of the TA project is increased knowledge and awareness\u2014among \npolicy makers in particular and the public in general\u2014of the effects of FTAs on business activity, \neconomic welfare, and trade negotiations, as well as best practices in FTAs. The expected \noutcome is a number of quality studies for promoting policy dialogue among stakeholders \n(governments, private sector, ASEAN Secretariat, and multilateral organizations) on how to \nmaximize the net benefits of Asian FTAs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  At the core of the TA project are three studies that focus on closely related aspects of \nthe spread of FTAs in Asia.8  \n \n13.  Business Activity. The first study covers the impact of FTAs on business activity. Such \nfirm-level surveys do not exist for Asian countries. This might be due in part to the recent \nproliferation of FTAs in the region and the limited research attention given to analyzing FTAs. \nAccordingly, firm-level surveys of Asian countries, including possibly Japan, Singapore, Sri \nLanka, and Thailand, will be conducted to document the micro-level benefits of overlapping \nFTAs (e.g., expanding market access and realization of economies of scale in production) and \nthe costs (e.g., administrative/business costs from complex rules of origin). The results from the \nenterprise surveys of Asian countries will be used for a comparative analysis of the impact of \nFTAs on businesses in Asia and Latin America, which is being undertaken in close partnership \nwith the Inter-American Development Bank and the Institute of Developing Economies in Tokyo. \nThis type of unique comparative analysis at the firm-level will enable the collection of primary \ndata, and provide original insights on business behavior under different FTA regimes.  \n \n14.  FTA  Negotiations.  The  second  involves  case  studies  of  FTA  negotiations.  FTA \nnegotiations, which often deal with goods, services, and a host of other issues, are becoming \nincreasingly technically complex in legal and economic terms. Policy makers, particularly in \nLDCs, do not widely understand the process of such negotiations and their implications. Thus, a \nset of Asian case studies on successful FTA negotiations will be prepared for FTA negotiators, \nparticularly from LDCs. Such case studies will examine (i) an inventory of regulations/future \nregulatory strategy, (ii) economic interests, (iii) negotiating strategies, (iv) expected and actual \noutcomes, (v) capacity issues, (vi) sectoral restructuring and adjustment, and (vii) lessons for \nLDCs.  \n \n15.  Economic Effects. The third is a model-based study of the economic effects of FTAs. \nGCGE model-based analysis is useful for simulating the economic effects of the spread of FTAs \nin Asia using a consistent framework. This study will analyze alternative scenarios, including (i) \nthe existing pattern of FTAs in Asia, encompassing a plethora of bilateral agreements and \ntrading blocs; (ii) the consolidation of some agreements into larger regional and/or subregional \nagreements; and (iii) the eventual creation of an Asia-wide FTA covering all the major Asian \neconomies, including possibly Australia and New Zealand. For each scenario, the study will \nshed light on their economic welfare, sector-level implications, and distribution effects, to the \n                                                 \n8 Any activity in a member country would commence after ADB has received the no-objection in writing to its inclusion \nin the regional TA. ", "4   \nextent possible.9 The results will point to policy options that could enhance trade and investment \nintegration in Asia. This study also will respond to Indian Prime Minister Singh\u2019s suggestion that \nADB study the benefits of such an economic agglomeration in Asia.   \n \n16.  Besides being published individually, the three TA-supported studies will be inputs for \nthe  preparation  of  a  fourth  overarching  study\u2014a  best  practice  manual  on  designing  and \nnegotiating FTAs. Meant for FTA negotiators, particularly those from LDCs, the manual will \naddress important topics in new style FTAs. It will cover goods, services, investment, and \nsensitive issues (e.g., competition policy and public procurement). Further, the manual will \nprovide guidance on designing model rules of origin, and negotiating strategies and tactics; and \nwill suggest sources of information on trade, FTAs, and negotiations.   \n \n17.  The results of these four studies will be disseminated widely through several modes, \nincluding publication as books, working papers, and policy briefs; and via policy workshops and \nseminars in Asia and internationally. The studies also will be posted on ADB\u2019s Asia Regional \nIntegration Center Web site. Where appropriate, they will be translated to permit wider use in \nthe region.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $600,000.  The  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan, will finance the TA on a grant basis. The cost will cover remuneration, \ntravel,  and  per  diem  for  international  and  national  consultants,  as  well  as  meetings  and \nconferences, publications, and other miscellaneous costs. A detailed cost breakdown and the \nproposed financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n19.  ADB  will  be  the  TA  Executing  Agency.  OREI  will  implement  the  TA,  in  close \ncollaboration with other ADB departments and offices.  \n \n20.  The TA activities will be implemented with the assistance of national and international \nconsultants. The TA will require approximately 15 person-months of national consulting services \nand 11 person-months of international consulting services. The consultants will be engaged \nindividually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The scope of work \nand outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.   \n \n21.  Four national consultants will be engaged to undertake firm-level surveys and case \nstudies on FTA negotiations. The consultants will be experts on designing and administering \nfirm surveys, and will have substantial knowledge of the concerned countries\u2019 trade policies and \nprocedures. They also should have a strong statistical background in data processing and \nanalysis. In addition, three to four national consultants will be engaged to prepare country \nstudies of FTA negotiations. These consultants will be experts on international trade policy, \nregional economic cooperation, and trade negotiations, and will have extensive knowledge of \nthe bilateral or subregional FTAs being studied.  \n \n                                                 \n9  To maximize synergies with previous work, this study will build on the results of ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance \nfor Long-Term Scenarios for Asian Growth and Trade, 2005\u20132020. Manila (TA 6205-REG, for $300,000, approved \non 6 December); and ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for a Study on Economic Cooperation Between East Asia \nand South Asia. Manila (TA 6282-REG, for $500,000, approved on 9 December).  ", "    5\n22.  An international consultant will be engaged to prepare a model-based study on the \neconomic effects of FTAs. The consultant will be an expert in the applications of GCGE, and will \nhave substantial experience in trade and investment policies in Asia. Using the findings of the \nstudies  prepared  by  the  other  consultants,  three  international  consultants  (a  lawyer,  an \neconomist, and a negotiator) will be engaged to prepare a best practice manual on designing \nand  negotiating  FTAs.  These  consultants  will have  extensive  experience  in  designing  and \nproducing a manual specifically for trade negotiators in LDCs.   \n \n23.  OREI staff will participate as resource persons in all the components of this project, \nincluding field work, report writing, and presentations at conferences.  \n \n23.  The TA is to be implemented over 17 months, from November 2006 to April 2008.  \n \n24.  The  design  of  the  TA  project  has  been  discussed  with  major  regional/international \norganizations, and TA implementation will be coordinated closely with them. ASEAN senior \ntrade  officials  and  academics  have  endorsed  ADB  support  for  carrying  out  special  issues \nstudies (including analyzing the trade agreements that are the focus of this TA project) for the \nASEAN economic ministers/senior officials\u2019 process. ADB has set up an informal advisory group \ncomprising  senior  trade  policy  makers  and  academics  from  the  region;  and  will  draw  on \nexpertise from Asia\u2019s think tanks, research institutes, and academic institutions. Further, ADB \nwill  coordinate  closely  with  the  Inter-American  Development  Bank,  Pacific  Economic \nCooperation  Council,  and  the  Institute  of  Developing  Economies  in  Tokyo  on  a  major \ncomponent of the TA project\u2014a comparative analysis of the impact of FTAs on businesses in \nAsia and Latin America. ADB also will consult the WTO during the preparation of the manual on \ndesigning/negotiating  FTAs,  and  will  work  with  the  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social \nCommission for Asia and the Pacific on data collection on FTA trends in Asia. The Organisation \nfor  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development,  World  Bank,  and  WTO  will  be  invited  to \nparticipate in workshops conducted for the TA project.  \n \n \nIV.
