I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $30,000,000 equivalent in yuan, comprising (i) an A loan of up to $15,000,000 equivalent in \nyuan and (ii) a complementary loan1 of up to $15,000,000 equivalent in yuan to Chongqing \nTianzow Animal Husbandry Technology Limited (the borrower) for the Tianzow Advanced Pig \nBreeding Stock Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). \n \n2.  The project comprises the construction and operation of a modern pig breeding stock farm \nin Chongqing municipality in the PRC. 2 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan will be used for \n(i) the repayment of shareholder loans to the borrower by Sichuan Tianzow Breeding Technology \nCo., Ltd. (Tianzow) to fund the construction of the farm, (ii) biological assets for the farm, and \n(iii) working capital for the first year of farm operations. Through this project, ADB will support the \nsupply  of  high-quality  pig  breeding  stock  and  promote  environmentally  sustainable,  high-\nefficiency, and high-biosecurity pig production in the PRC. \n \n  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n3.  Livestock in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Livestock contributes to nearly half of total \ngross domestic product generated by agriculture in the PRC. Pork is the most important source \nof animal protein for PRC consumers. However, the PRC pig sector faces the following severe \nissues: biosecurity risks, lack of access to productive pig genetics, large proportion of small pig \nfarms with low efficiency and production standards, and environmental concerns. \n \n4.  Biosecurity risks. African swine fever (ASF) has been a big threat to the PRC pig sector. \nThe first reported ASF case in the PRC occurred in August 2018, after which the virus spread \nacross the country. ASF had reduced the pig population by almost half in the PRC by the end of \n2019, indicating a need to rebuild the herd with strong genetics. A new strain of ASF was found \nin the PRC in late 2020, which affects sows\u2019 reproductive systems. To tackle this pressing \nchallenge, the PRC government (i) promoted the recovery of pig farming by expanding large-\nscale farms, (ii) intensified efforts to develop a vaccine, (iii) restricted cross-zone transport of live \npigs, and (iv) increased pork import to meet domestic demand. \n \n5.  Lack of access to productive pig genetics. The average piglets per sow per year (PSY) \nin the PRC pig sector estimated by industry experts was about 20\u201321 before the ASF outbreak \nand about 15\u201316 after the ASF outbreak because many farms used commercial pigs as sows3 to \nproduce commercial pigs to take advantage of high prices in 2020, which significantly reduced \nproduction efficiency. The PSY in countries with an advanced pig sector (e.g., in North America \nand Western Europe) can typically reach 24\u201330. This significant difference in productivity is \nprimarily because pig species in countries with an advanced pig sector have more favorable \n \n1  The complementary loan is an ADB syndicated loan product that can be offered in various currencies (including local \ncurrencies) funded by commercial banks, where ADB is the lender of record. For this project, ADB is seeking approval \nfor the A and complementary loan facilities to be denominated in yuan. \n2  The farm will engage in selective breeding, an advanced scientific approach to pair a boar and a gilt or sow to \nincorporate or maintain desired traits. Genetics play an important role in a pig\u2019s productivity and meat quality. There \nare several generations of pig breeding stock such as great grandparent (GGP), grandparent (GP), and F1 (parent). \n3  A female commercial pig is not classified as breeder but is sold for meat.  \n \n ", "2  \ngenetic traits. The PRC government implemented policies to promote the development of the \ndomestic pig breeding and subsidize the adoption of productive pig genetics by small-scale farms.  \n \n6.  Small pig farms with low efficiency and low standards. Small pig farms with fewer \nthan 500 pigs contribute to nearly 50% of annual pig production in the PRC. They tend to overreact \nto market prices, which is a major reason behind the pig price cycle.4 Small pig farms are less \nefficient with low productivity and less advanced animal waste treatment. Small pig farms with \ninadequate biosecurity management systems are expected to bear most of the economic losses \ncreated by ASF and other diseases. The government has steadily industrialized the sector and is \naiming for at least 65% of pork from industrial farming operations by 2025. Smaller operations are \nencouraged to use their farms to raise pigs for larger companies (contract farming model). Larger \npig companies are more likely to make an investment in pig genetics. Pig farming modernization, \nwith larger-scale farmers and better genetics, could help to stabilize pig prices. \n \n7.  Environmental concerns. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \nreports that livestock contribute to 14.5% of all human-induced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, \nof which about 81% is attributable to ruminants and 9% to pigs (largely because the GHG \nemission per unit of pork is much lower than that of beef).5 In addition, genetic improvement of \nlivestock population is a cost-effective strategy to mitigate climate change and improve the \nadaptive ability of livestock animals to new environments.6 Another major environmental concern \nis pollution from animal waste. The PRC pig sector generates about 864 million tons of animal \nwaste per year, equivalent to one-third of total animal waste generated by the PRC livestock \nsector.7 The government has significantly tightened environmental regulations since 2010 to force \nthe pig sector to invest more in waste treatment. \n \n8.  Project selection. The project team identified Tianzow as a suitable candidate for ADB \nsupport because (i) it is a leading domestic supplier of high-quality pig breeding stock; (ii) it has \nshown robust biosecurity practices with much less herd loss compared to the industry average; \n(iii) it has an inclusive business model, which incorporates smallholder farmers into its contract \nfarming operations; and (iv) it is committed to improving its standards of safeguards, corporate \ngovernance, and animal welfare. \n \n2.  Project Design \n \n9.  The  project  comprises  the  construction  and  operation  of  a  modern  seven-floor  pig \nbreeding stock farm in Chongqing municipality. Tianzow plans to finish the farm construction by \nDecember 2021.  \n \n10.  Supply high-quality breeding stock to the market. Founded in 2004, Tianzow enjoys \na first mover advantage in having developed a proprietary genetic pool and a mature operating \nmodel. Tianzow is one of the first PRC companies that has partnered with leading international \npig genetic companies such as Fast Genetics (Canada) and Axiom (France) to develop a strong \n \n4  When pig prices are high, smallholder farmers expand pig farming aggressively to take advantage of the high prices, \nwhich increases supply and decreases prices. When observed prices drop, smallholder farmers quickly exit pig \nfarming, which decreases supply and increases prices. Consistent with this pattern, pig prices increased to high \nlevels in 2019 and 2020 due to reduced supply, but have since significantly decreased in 2021 due to rebuilt supply.  \n5  P.J.

Tianzow also plans to source pig \ngenetics from Denmark and the United States in 2022\u20132024 to further solidify the company\u2019s \nleading position in the PRC. The average PSY in Tianzow pig farms is about 23\u201324 and can reach \n27 in some farms. Its core business is selling breeding stock such as grandparents and F1s \n(crossbred from purebred breeder pigs) to pig farming companies, which contributed to about \n46% of gross profit on average during 2017\u20132020. Commercial pigs contribute to about 44% of \ngross profit8 and the remaining 10% is from ancillary products and services. \n \n11.  Reducing animal waste-related pollution. The project supports animal waste treatment \nto reduce pollution. Tianzow composts pig manure, which is combined with coconut chaff and \nsawdust in a tank and mechanically aerated. The waste mix is effectively converted to a dry \norganic compost material that is distributed to local farmers as organic fertilizers. The process \ngenerates heat and effectively inactivate any residual pathogens and can kill the ASF virus in \nwaste.9 As a result of the heat, excess moisture evaporates and there is no liquid effluent or waste \ngenerated. Pig urine will be treated by an anaerobic digestion pond system that will produce \nbiogas and effluent up to applicable standards to be used at plantations. This biogas will replace \nliquefied petroleum gas as an energy source for water heating and cooking by employees at \nfarms, thereby supporting climate change mitigation by reducing project GHG emissions. It is \nexpected that 1,500 tons of carbon dioxide will be reduced every year because of this project. \n \n12.  Strong biosecurity management. Tianzow implements biosecurity management best \npractices on all its pig farms. Those practices include (i) implementing a five-layer protection \nsystem in terms of disinfection to ensure all materials and people are disinfected thoroughly \nbefore entering the production lines, (ii) minimizing interactions between different sections of the \npig farms, (iii) using software to trace Tianzow\u2019s trucks to transport pigs to pig farms and to \nslaughterhouses, and (iv) adopting a 4-week batch production system through which disease risk \nis mitigated with less contact during pig transportation. Human\u2013livestock\u2013wildlife interactions \npresent a significant risk of zoonotic disease, which is mitigated by Tianzow\u2019s indoor farm model. \nAs the project will emphasize animal health and animal welfare and minimize the spread of \nantimicrobial resistance and zoonoses, it is aligned with a \u201cOne Health\u201d approach. \n \n13.  Innovative and efficient multi-floor pig farms. The project\u2019s seven-floor pig breeding \nstock farm follows Tianzow\u2019s corporate farming model, which presents several advantages \nincluding (i) saving land and labor cost compared to traditional single floor pig farm, as facilities \nare aggregated in one building with advanced technologies, such as auto feeding systems, \ntemperature and humidity controls, and ventilation systems; (ii) improving feed conversion ratio \nand average daily gains due to Tianzow\u2019s strong breeding stock genetics; and (iii) reducing the \nrisk of ASF because each pig is restricted to one floor to avoid mixing animals.   \n \n14.  Gender equality in the pig farming business. As the PRC has gone through rapid \nurbanization since 2000, it has been increasingly difficult for the pig sector to attract and retain \nwomen workers because of the remote locations and relatively poor working environments of pig \nfarms. To address the shortage of adequate skills and knowledge in pig farming, Tianzow has \nestablished cooperation agreements with contract farmers to help them build pig houses and \n \n8  Only one-third of piglets can be selected as future GGPs or GPs. The rest are raised as commercial pigs through the \ncontract farming model and sold to slaughterhouses as a complementary business. \n9  C. Turner and S.M. Williams. 2001.

These numbers reflect the limited number of female applicants when hiring pig \nfarm employees because of the unique nature of the job. \n \n3.  Tianzow and the Borrower \n \n15.  Tianzow is one of the largest pig breeding stock multiplier companies in the PRC, although \nits market share is small, given the PRC\u2019s highly fragmented pig breeding stock market. Tianzow \noperates 47 pig farms in 16 provinces across the PRC and employs 860 staff, of which 70% are \nin rural areas. The borrower, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tianzow, is in Chongqing municipality \nand its operational and financial management is controlled by Tianzow. Founder Yu Ping is the \nchairperson of the board and president of Tianzow. He is an engineer with extensive international \nbusiness  experience.  Tan  Jin  and  Yu  Zhengbo  (the  son  of  Yu  Ping  and  Tan  Jin)  have \nmanagement roles in Tianzow (Tan Jin as vice president and secretary of the board, and Yu \nZhengbo as sales and marketing manager). Yu Ping, Tan Jin, and Yu Zhengbo are executive \ndirectors of the board and collectively own 68.03% of Tianzow. CP Group (Thailand) and Itochu \n(Japan) each own an 8.4% stake in Tianzow indirectly. \n \n16.  ADB conducted integrity due diligence in accordance with ADB\u2019s Integrity Due Diligence \nGuidelines for Nonsovereign Operations.11 The borrower, its shareholders, and ultimate beneficial \nowners are not the subject of any unresolved or substantiated adverse media or other relevant \ninformation that may pose significant integrity risk. ADB has obtained reasonable assurance that \nthe borrower was not established or is being used for money laundering or terrorism financing in \nthe project jurisdiction, or that the transaction is being used for tax secrecy, tax evasion, or tax \nfraud, with the tax integrity risks being low and acceptable.12  \n \nB.  Development Impacts, Outcomes, and Outputs \n \n17.  Impacts.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  rural  revitalization  and \nmodernization of agriculture sector accelerated, and green and smart agriculture promoted.13 \n \n18.  Outcomes. The project will have the following outcomes: sustainable pig breeding stock \noperations in the PRC scaled up, and livelihoods for farmers and workers provided. \n \n19.  Outputs. The project will have the following outputs: (i) a pig breeding stock and waste \ntreatment facility with gender-sensitive design constructed and operated, (ii) gender equality in \nTianzow\u2019s workforce improved, and (iii) a safe environment for women and men workers created. \n \n \n \n \n \n10 Under the contract farming model, Tianzow supplies weaned piglets; farming inputs (such as feed, medicine, and \nvaccines); and technical support to contract farmers and buys back the pigs at a guaranteed minimum fee. The \ncontract farming model helps farmers mitigate market risk and earn a stable income. \n11 ADB. 2003.

Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is aligned with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which calls for ADB to scale up its financing for agribusiness and to promote \ngender equality in at least 75% of the number of ADB\u2019s committed operations by 2030.14 The \nproject is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2021\u20132025, which \nsupports  (i)  strengthening  environmentally  sustainable  development  by  promoting  waste \ntreatment; (ii) partnering with small and medium-sized enterprises, which are critical sources of \nproductivity  enhancing  innovations  and  tend  to  be  more  dynamic  in  generating  jobs;  (iii) \nexpanding nonsovereign operations with advanced technology and innovative business models \nthat promote greater resilience and help improve resource efficiency and quality standards; (iv) \nstrengthening gender equality; and (v) mobilizing new external sources of development finance.15 \n \n21.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  ADB  sovereign  operations.  The  project \ncontributes to the following operational priorities (OPs) of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: OP 1 (addressing \nremaining poverty and reducing inequalities), which aims to improve standards of living for poor \nand  vulnerable  people;16 OP  2  (accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality),  which  calls  for \nincreasing women\u2019s economic empowerment and access to job skills;17 OP 3 (tackling climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability), \nwhich promotes environmental sustainability through waste management;18 and OP 5 (promoting \nrural development and food security), which addresses food security and increases agricultural \nproductivity to provide sufficient, safe, and affordable food.19 The project will complement a PRC \nsovereign  project,  the  Yellow  River  Ecological  Corridor  and  Climate-Resilient  Agriculture \nDevelopment Project, which aims to (i) support sustainable agriculture sector development, and \n(ii) promote food and agricultural products with environmental protection and climate adaptation \nand mitigation.20 Potential areas of collaboration include supporting solid waste treatment and \nTianzow\u2019s contract farmers within the Yellow River Ecological Corridor. \n \n22.  Lessons. In its 2018 sector-wide evaluation, ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department \nrecommended  that  ADB  \u201cincrease  the  attention  paid  to  agricultural  activities,  policy  and \ninstitutional reforms, and the private sector.\u201d21 The project supports a critical private sector-led \nintervention (the supply of high-quality pig breeding stock) of agricultural activities.

ADB\u2019s \nloan will include a complementary loan, funded by international commercial banks. \n(ii) Safeguard and governance standards. ADB will support Tianzow and the borrower \nto  develop  an  improved  environmental  and  social  management  plan  following \ninternational good practice on waste management; and monitor their progress during \nproject implementation. Further, an action plan has been designed to help Tianzow \nimprove its animal welfare practices, and progress will be verified by an independent \nexpert.26 Finally, another action plan has been designed to help Tianzow achieve \nbetter corporate governance practices.27 \n(iii) Gender mainstreaming. Tianzow has agreed to implement a gender action plan \n(which ADB helped to design) that aims to improve gender inclusion and diversity in \nits workforce to address the gender gaps assessed during due diligence. \n \nC.  Risks \n \n[Redacted] \n \n27.  Impact  of  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19).  Tianzow\u2019s  pig  farm  operations  were \ndisrupted, and construction was delayed in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tianzow \ndid not experience a material adverse impact on its performance in 2020 because of high pork \nprices. Tianzow provided protective equipment to all the workers in its pig farms and to contract \nfarmers to maintain normal operations. \n \n28.  [Redacted]  \n \n  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n29.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category B), involuntary resettlement (category B), \nand indigenous peoples (category C).28 \n \n \n26 With ADB\u2019s guidance, Tianzow appointed and paid for a global consulting firm specializing in the pig farming business \nto help it identify the gaps between its animal welfare practices and best international practices. \n27 With ADB\u2019s guidance, Tianzow appointed and paid for an experienced law firm to identify the gaps between (i) \nTianzow\u2019s actual corporate governance practices and IFC\u2019s corporate governance tool kits for family-owned \ncompanies, and (ii) Tianzow\u2019s actual corporate governance practices and requirements of listed companies on the \nShenzhen Stock Exchange (Tianzow is planning for an initial public offering [IPO] on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange \nin 2022). \n28 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n \n ", "8  \n30.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the \nadverse impacts in the safeguard reports and plans. The environmental and social measures and \nthe institutional capacity and commitment of Tianzow and the borrower to manage the project\u2019s \nsocial and environmental impacts are deemed adequate. Potential risks and impacts identified \nare generally site specific and can be effectively managed by good environmental management \nplans. The borrower has obtained land use rights for the project land, most of which are under \nlease  while  a  portion was  permanently  acquired  by  the  government.  Government-led  land \nacquisition did not lead to any physical or economic displacement. No indigenous peoples impacts \nare envisaged for the project. The proceeds of ADB\u2019s investment will not support activities with \nsignificant environmental or social impacts. \n \n31.  An external third party conducted a corporate audit in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The corporate audit assessed Tianzow\u2019s operations as complying with statutory \nrequirements. It deemed Tianzow and the borrower\u2019s current environmental and social systems, \nprocesses, and practices commensurate with the risks and impacts associated with their business \nand operations. Audit findings and recommendations to address gaps identified have been \ndocumented in a corrective action plan and agreed by ADB, Tianzow, and the borrower. \n \n32.  Tianzow  and  the  borrower  will  (i)  apply  ADB's  prohibited  investment  activities  list, \n(ii) ensure that the project complies with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by national \nlaws and regulations, and (iii) establish and maintain an appropriate environmental and social \nmanagement system (ESMS) satisfactory to ADB before disbursement. The ESMS will set out \nrequirements, as applicable, for compliance with national labor laws and measures to comply with \nthe internationally recognized core labor standards, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy \n(2001).29 The ESMS will also contain requirements, as applicable, for information disclosure and \nconsultation with affected people following ADB requirements. Tianzow and the borrower will \nreport annually to ADB on (i) their compliance with such law, the ESMS, and ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement; and (ii) the measures taken at the corporate and project levels. \n \n33.  Effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. ADB conducted gender analysis, which concluded that Tianzow closely follows \nregulations on labor conditions and equal opportunity for all its employees, but that it lacks gender-\nsensitive policies and practices. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998), \nTianzow has incorporated measures to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in \nits business activities. Key features of the gender action plan are as follows: (i) upgrade and build \nsanitation and changing facilities separate for female and male staff proportionally; (ii) increase \nwomen\u2019s  representation  in  skilled  roles;  (iii)  revise  Tianzow\u2019s  corporate  policies  to  include \nprovisions on gender inclusion in human resource management; and (iv) elaborate on and \ndisseminate a new anti-sexual harassment policy, supported by the appointment of a female \nmanager in charge of the matter and training delivered across the company\u2019s sites. Tianzow will \nsubmit periodic reports on implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n34.  Tianzow was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \n29 ADB. 2003.
