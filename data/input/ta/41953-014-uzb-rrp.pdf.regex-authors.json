THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment of up to $6 million  (in sum equivalent)  in Joint-Stock Commercial Bank \n(JSCB) Ipak Yuli (Ipak Yuli) in Uzbekistan. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY  \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  The banking system in Uzbekistan is in an early stage of development and faces several \nchallenges. Its penetration and financial intermediation function is poor, despite growth in recent \nyears. Banking accounted for only 35.3% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) in \nterms of assets in 2011, while total loans were only 20.1% of GDP and total deposits 31.1%\u2014\namong the lowest in the region. Lending to the private sector was also among the lowest in the \nregion. In 2009, the ratio of domestic credit to the private sector relative to GDP was only \n14.6%. While  various  measures  have  been  undertaken  to  strengthen  the  role  of  financial \nintermediation  in  the  economy,  further  reforms  are  needed  to  improve  the  operating  and \nregulatory environments and develop the private sector. \n \n3.  In alignment with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program, \n2006\u20132010 for Uzbekistan and the stated objective to promote private sector development \nthrough  improved  financial  intermediation,  in  2007  the  ADB  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment undertook a review of private commercial banks in Uzbekistan.1 After discussions \nwith the Central and West Asia Department, two banks were identified for potential intervention. \nFollowing several rounds of due diligence, ADB decided to pursue the opportunity of making an \nequity investment in Ipak Yuli. \n \n4.  Ipak Yuli, a joint-stock commercial bank, was incorporated in Uzbekistan in 1990. It was \nre-registered as a new legal entity in June 2000 following its merger with JSCB Umar and JSCB \nNamangan. Ipak Yuli\u2019s primary business comprises retail, commercial, and corporate banking \nactivities; securities operations; foreign currency operations; money transfers; origination of \nloans and guarantees; and taking of deposits. Regarded as one of the leading mid-sized private \nbanks in the country, with 10 branches and 62 express centers (branches with limited scope of \nservices) throughout the country,  Ipak Yuli\u2019s market share (in terms of assets) has grown \nsteadily, from 1.4% in 2006 to 2.3% in 2011. Supported by the doubling of its customer base to \n89,829 during this period, in 2011 Ipak Yuli ranked ninth in the market in terms of assets. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n5.  Initially, Ipak Yuli was primarily oriented toward lending to corporate clients; however, \nthis strategy has evolved to include micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and \nretail lending. Today, Ipak Yuli is a universal bank addressing multiple market segments. As \ndetailed in its development strategy for 2011\u20132016, Ipak Yuli seeks to strengthen its position in \nthe market by providing a wider spectrum of banking products and services that cater to the \nneeds of its customers in each identified market segment.  \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program: Uzbekistan, 2006\u20132010. Manila. \n ", "2    \n \n6.  While  Ipak  Yuli  has  maintained  its  strong  corporate  client  base,  its  largest  target \ncustomer niche comprises rapidly growing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).2 These \nclients tend to view Ipak Yuli as a stable, reliable bank due to its regional presence, high-quality \nservices, and availability of lending resources for private businesses. Priority products and \nservices for SMEs include working capital loans, leasing operations, and project financing\u2014all \nof which help support the financial sustainability of the SME borrowers. In addition to SMEs, \nIpak Yuli has sought to support private entrepreneurship by targeting micro-lenders as a priority \narea, working with ADB and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.  \n \n7.  Retail banking is among Ipak Yuli\u2019s newest and most underdeveloped business lines. \nIpak Yuli seeks to strengthen its retail banking portfolio by  (i) enhancing product offerings \n(consumer  loans,  plastic  cards,  money  transfers,  mortgages,  deposits);  (ii)  developing \npartnerships  and  corporate  sales  channels  with  companies  that  provide  services  to  retail \ncustomers; and (iii) augmenting the services provided by its call center to increase cross-selling. \nConsistent with  its stated  objectives,  Ipak  Yuli  has  plans to continue the  expansion  of its \ndistribution network operations into the regions over the next 4 years by opening another four \nbranches in locations with high demand for its products and services. Targeted cities include \nAndijan, Bukhara, Karshi, and Termez.  \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n1.  Ownership \n8.  As of year-end 2011, Ipak Yuli was owned by 740 corporate entities and individuals, \nincluding Uzbekinvest (a government-owned insurance company), Zamon Plus Sarmoya (an \ninvestment advisory company owned by Ipak Yuli shareholders), Alfa Invest (a private insurance \ncompany),  Kafolat  (a  government-owned  insurance  company),  and  Mebel  Invest  Group  (a \nfurniture company). Ipak Yuli\u2019s shares are listed on the Uzbekistan Stock Exchange, but there is \nno active secondary market for the shares.  \n \n2.  Management \n9.  Ipak  Yuli's  management  team  comprises  experienced  Uzbek  bankers..  Rustam \nRakhimbekov has been chairman of Ipak Yuli since 1998.    \n \n3.  Governance Structure \n10.  Ipak Yuli has a nine-member council (board of directors); most were elected by the \ngeneral shareholders' meeting in mid-2011. Most of the council members have professional \nqualifications and work experience in banking and finance. Although no legislation defines the \nindependence of council members, they cannot be Ipak Yuli employees, cannot have any labor \nrelations with the bank, and cannot be members of the management board. The council's main \nfunction is to supervise Ipak Yuli's compliance with its own internal policies and procedures. The \naudit committee and the recently formed risk management committee assist the council. \n \n11.  Ipak Yuli is managed through various levels of corporate governance, including the \ngeneral  shareholders'  meeting,  the  council,  and  the  management  board.  The  council,  the \n                                                \n2  At the end of 2011, Ipak Yuli\u2019s SME loans represented over 62% of the total loan portfolio, microfinance accounted \nfor more than 12%, corporate loans 22%, and retail loans 4%.  ", "  3 \ninternal audit department (which reports to the council), and the Revision Commission3 (which \nreports to the general shareholders' meeting) supervise corporate governance. In addition, the \norganization and effectiveness of Ipak Yuli's corporate governance are evaluated as part of the \nannual CAMELS4 assessment conducted by the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU). Corporate \ngovernance is guided by internal policies, regulations, and procedures, reflecting the institution's \ncorporate goals, strategic objectives, values, and codes of conduct, as well as the processes for \ndecision-making at all levels of bank governance, with clear divisions of responsibility, authority, \nand accountability.5  \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n12.  Earnings performance. Ipak Yuli's net income has grown steadily over the past 4 years \nfrom  SUM4.3  billion  in  2008  to  SUM6.3  billion  in  2009,  SUM8.1  billion  in  2010,  and \nSUM12.8 billion in 2011, driven by growth in interest and noninterest income. Net interest \nincome rose by almost 88.0% in 2009, helped by the expansion of the loan portfolio, particularly \nof high-yielding microfinance loans, and the spike in the net interest margin. Although interest \nincome continued to rise in 2010, with the narrowing of the net interest margin during the year, \nnet interest income decreased slightly. Despite this, the rise in noninterest income during 2010 \nmore than offset the decline in net interest income. Noninterest income rose by 67.8% in 2010, \nbolstered by the increase in fee income (related to charges for settlements and payments, cash \nwire transfers, and plastic cards), the net gain on foreign exchange operations, and the rise in \ndividend income. In 2011, increases in net interest income related to loan portfolio growth and \nthe widening of the net interest margin, and noninterest income attributable to the continued \nincrease in fee income, contributed to earnings growth.  \n \n13.  Ipak Yuli\u2019s return on average assets was fairly constant during 2008\u20132010, as the pace \nof growth in net income largely matched that of average assets. In 2011, with the growth in net \nincome outpacing that of average assets, the return on average assets increased to 2.21% from \n1.74% in 2010. The return on equity also increased, from 19.34% in 2010 to 22.32% in 2011. \n \n14.  Asset quality. The growth of Ipak Yuli\u2019s loan portfolio has been driven over the last \nseveral  years  by  sharp  increases  in  the  retail,  microfinance,  and  SME  areas,  with  more \nmoderate increases in the corporate portfolio, a reflection of the bank\u2019s evolving strategy.  \n \n15.  Capital adequacy. Ipak Yuli has more than quadrupled its capital base since 2007, with \ntotal  equity  rising  from  SUM13.7  billion  in  2007  to  SUM56.1 billion  in  2011.  The  bank \nstrengthened its capital position by issuing additional shares each successive year,6 as well as \ncontinuing  its  policy  of  dividend  capitalization.  In  terms  of  capital  adequacy,  Ipak  Yuli \ncomfortably meets the minimum statutory capital requirements prescribed by CBU and is within \nthe standards of the Bank for International Settlements (Basel guidelines), with a tier 1 capital \nratio of 13.7% and total capital adequacy ratio of 14.5% in 2011.  \n \n                                                \n3  The Revision Commission\u2019s responsibility is to verify the reliability of the bank\u2019s financial information, using the \nreports of the independent annual audit as well as the materials prepared by the internal audit. \n4  CAMELS is defined as capital adequacy, asset quality, management quality, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to \nmarket risk. \n5  Activities, rights, and responsibilities for the shareholders, the council, and the management board are reflected in \ndocuments such as the bank\u2019s charter and policies. \n6  Ipak Yuli issued SUM2.6 billion of ordinary shares in 2008, SUM7.0 billion in 2009, SUM6.0 billion in 2010, and \nSUM6.6 billion in 2011.  \n ", "4    \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n16.  The proposed equity investment in Ipak Yuli of up to $6 million (in sum equivalent) will \nbe  financed  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital  resources.7 ADB  will  not  be  the  single  largest \nshareholder in Ipak Yuli. The investment will represent approximately 15% of issued capital.  \n \nB.  Financial Assumptions  \n17.  Ipak Yuli's management projects modest growth in the balance sheet in the short and \nmedium term, in line with economic forecasts and its strategic preference for a measured pace \nof expansion.  \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Exit Strategy \n18.  ADB will look to the stability and improvement in Ipak Yuli\u2019s operating performance over \nthe next several years before exiting the investment becomes a feasible option. \n \n2.  Reporting Arrangements \n19.  Ipak Yuli will provide ADB with financial reports at predetermined regular intervals and \nas requested. ADB will review these reports on an ongoing basis and monitor the facility \naccordingly.  ADB will  also  have  the right  to  appoint  a  director  on Ipak  Yuli\u2019s  council  (the \nequivalent of a board of directors). Ipak Yuli will be required to retain a reputable accounting firm \nacceptable to ADB to conduct annual audits of its financial statements under IFRS guidelines. \n \n20.  Ipak Yuli will provide ADB with technical assistance progress reports at predetermined \nintervals and as requested, outlining the status of implementation. ADB will review these reports \non an ongoing basis and monitor the facility. Included in these reports will be an annual report \non its safeguards and social dimensions performance.  \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n21.  Justification for the equity investment is based on the following considerations: \n \n(i)  Supporting  improvements  in  the  quality  of  the  banking  system.  As  a \nshareholder of Ipak Yuli and an active member on the council, ADB will help the \nbank  improve  its  operations,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  internal  controls, \ncorporate governance, risk management, credit risk management, anti-money \nlaundering  and  anticorruption  measures,  and  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards.  This  support  will  be  augmented  by  the  provision  of  technical \nassistance (TA).  \n(ii)  Catalyzing  foreign  investment  in  Uzbekistan.  International  institutional \ninvestors and multilateral organizations have been hesitant to invest in Uzbek \nbanks.  ADB\u2019s  equity  investments  in  Ipak  Yuli,  in  combination  with  the \n                                                \n7 ADB will complement the proposed investment with technical assistance from the ongoing ADB. 2010. Technical \nAssistance for Capacity Building for Financial Institutions (Phase 2). Manila.   ", "  5 \nInternational Finance Corporation\u2019s equity investment in JSCB Hamkorbank,8 \nwould provide a significant signaling effect to foreign investors with regard to \npotential opportunities in the Uzbekistan banking system. \n \nE.  Technical Assistance \n22.  To strengthen the effectiveness of the intervention, ADB\u2019s ongoing TA for Capacity \nBuilding for Financial Institutions (Phase 2) will support areas to be determined in consultation \nwith Ipak Yuli.9 Topics that may be covered by the TA include governance and internal controls, \nrisk management, credit risk management, microcredit and SME financing, environmental and \nsocial safeguards (including tracking of gender benefits and the implementation of a gender \naction plan),10 and anti-money laundering and anticorruption measures. TA support alongside \nthe equity investment will allow ADB to add substantially more value to Ipak Yuli and increase \nADB's own eventual return. \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact \n23.  Support  for  the  banking  sector.  The  banking sector in  Uzbekistan  faces several \nchallenges, as it remains small and in a nascent stage of development, as revealed by the low \nasset-to-GDP ratio of 35.5%, total loans-to-GDP ratio of 20.1%, and total deposit-to-GDP ratio \nof 31.1%. Through its equity investment, ADB will provide systemic support to the sector at a \ncritical point in its development, strengthening financial intermediation and helping to promote \nconfidence in the banking system. The equity investment in Ipak Yuli will also lend key support \nto the sector by promoting the adoption of strengthened operating policies and procedures \nbased  on  international  best  practice  standards,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  corporate \ngovernance, internal controls, risk management, credit risk management, environmental and \nsocial safeguards, and anti-money laundering/anti-corruption. \n \n24.  Private sector development. The equity investment will strengthen Ipak Yuli\u2019s capital \nposition and in doing so, underpin the expansion of its operations. Given Ipak Yuli\u2019s niche \nmarket in private sector SME financing, this investment will contribute to the expansion of SMEs, \nan  underdeveloped  and  underserved  segment  of  the  Uzbekistan  economy.  The  equity \ninvestment will contribute to private sector development by helping to mobilize liquidity and \nchannel it toward the most productive investments through the extension of credit. \n \n2.  Outcome \n25.  The  equity  investment  will  support  Ipak  Yuli\u2019s  adoption  of  strengthened  operating \nprinciples  (i.e.,  corporate  governance,  internal  controls,  risk  management,  credit  risk \nmanagement, safeguards and social dimensions, and anti-money laundering/anti-corruption) \nbased on international best practice standards, contributing to the bank\u2019s overall performance \n                                                \n8  The International Finance Corporation made its equity investment in JSCB Hamkorbank in 2010. \n9  ADB. 2010.

Indicators  include  (i)  the  operating \nperformance of Ipak Yuli, specifically its commercial viability based on asset quality and capital \nadequacy; and (ii) economic sustainability, particularly the provision of financial services to \nviable private enterprises and allocation of resources based on increasing lending to MSMEs. \n \n3.  Outputs \n26.  ADB will make an equity investment in Ipak Yuli, and as an active shareholder, will assist \nin overseeing the implementation of strengthened operating principles based on international \nbest practice standards for corporate governance, internal controls, risk management, credit risk \nmanagement, safeguards and social dimensions (including implementing a gender action plan \nand core labor standards), and combating money laundering and corruption, and thus contribute \nto strengthening the bank\u2019s operating performance. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and the Country Partnership Strategy \n27.  Under Strategy 2020, ADB will strengthen its  regional and national support for the \nfinancial sector by helping to develop financial infrastructure, institutions, and products and \nservices and by promoting inclusive growth. Through such initiatives, ADB will continue to assist \nin channeling the region's savings into the most productive investments, as well as continue to \nbuild  the  capacity  of  financial  institutions  by  introducing  international  best  practices.  The \ninvestment supports institutional and sector development  by providing capital and capacity \nbuilding for the financial sector.   \n \n28.  The strategic priorities of the ADB country partnership strategy (CPS), 2006\u20132010 for \nUzbekistan include catalyzing private domestic and foreign investment through ADB\u2019s private \nsector operations.11 The CPS notes a number of potential transactions from the private sector \noperations side in the finance and infrastructure sectors. Indicative investments that ADB might \nconsider,  the  CPS  continues,  include  (i)  equity,  debt,  and/or  guarantee  financing  for \ninfrastructure  projects  in  areas  such  as  water,  power,  energy,  transportation,  and \ntelecommunications; (ii) equity investments in one or more private local banks as well as loans \nin the form of tier 2 capital or designated credit lines; (iii) inclusion of commercial banks in ADB\u2019s \nTrade Finance Program; (iv) equity investments or provision of credit lines to leasing companies \nor other nonbank financial institutions; (v) credit enhancement for securitization of mortgages \nand leases or other capital market transactions; and (vi) equity in investment funds. The equity \ninvestment is well within the range of transactions envisioned by this CPS, as well as the \ncountry  operations  business  plan,  2012\u2013201412 and  the  more  recent  2012\u20132016  country \npartnership strategy,13 which again highlight private sector development and financial sector \ndevelopment as key objectives. It is also in line with recent government initiatives including On \nPriority Areas for Further Reforms and Sustainability Improvement of Country\u2019s Finance and \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2006.

Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n29.  Supporting financial sector development is a key focus of development assistance for \nADB  in  line  with  the  tenets  detailed  in  ADB's  Private  Sector  Development  Strategy16 and \nEnhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy,17 which note improved economic growth, stimulated by \nprivate sector investment, as a key contributing factor in reducing poverty. The Private Sector \nDevelopment Strategy refers specifically to ADB's role in strengthening the financial sector in \nthe developing member countries. The strategy notes the critical importance of well-functioning \nfinancial systems for private sector development, which in turn underpins sustainable economic \ngrowth. Many developing member countries need to strengthen their financial institutions and \ncreate diversified financial markets that can finance private-sector-led growth. \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n30.  The investment is classified under category FI for impacts on the environment as it \ninvolves an equity investment in Ipak Yuli and some of the bank\u2019s portfolio (e.g., manufacturing) \nhave potential environmental impacts and risks. With respect to involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous peoples, the investment is classified under category FI (treated as C) because Ipak \nYuli\u2019s borrowers are not expected to acquire land using eminent domain law nor adversely affect \nthe  dignity,  human  rights,  livelihood  systems,  culture,  territories,  and  natural  or  cultural \nresources of indigenous peoples. Ipak Yuli\u2019s current environmental and social management \nsystem (ESMS) is limited to ensuring that borrowers follow national laws, requirements, and \nprocedures.
