INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB), guided by its Water for All policy,1 has been \nincreasing its water investments in the region through its Water Financing Program (WFP), \nsupported  by  the  Water  Financing  Partnership  Facility.  The  WFP  has  been  helping  ADB \nmember countries in Asia and the Pacific to develop and implement innovative solutions that will \nincrease water security through investments in rural and urban water services and integrated \nwater resources management in river basins. Building on the results of its water operations from \n2001 to 2010, ADB is preparing a water operational plan (WOP) for 2011\u20132020. A priority of the \nWOP will be supporting ADB clients in addressing the water-food-energy security nexus in the \nregion, so they can deal better with the impact of climate change. \n \n2.  In 2006, ADB commissioned the first Asian Water Development Outlook (AWDO) in \ncollaboration with the Asia-Pacific Water Forum (APWF). The AWDO was launched to inform \nleaders at the First Asia-Pacific Water Summit in 2007 about the need to improve water security \nthrough governance. Following the successful reception of the first AWDO, ADB and the APWF \nformed a team of experts from regional water organization and knowledge hubs to prepare a \nsecond version, with guidance from advisers in the region, including from Peking University. \n \n3.  The AWDO team\u2019s guiding vision for water security states that \n \nsocieties can enjoy water security when they successfully manage their water resources \nand services to: (i) satisfy household water and sanitation needs in all communities; \n(ii) support productive economies in agriculture and industry; (iii) develop vibrant, livable \ncities  and  towns;  (iv) restore  healthy  rivers  and  ecosystems;  and  (v) build  resilient \ncommunities that can adapt to change. \n \nThese  five  dimensions  of  water  security  depend  on  investments  combined  with  better \nknowledge and governance. With improved water security, the region can reduce poverty, \nprosper, grow more sustainably, and be more resilient in the face of climate change. \n \n4.  To promote regional research and capacity development in water security, ADB reached \nan  understanding  with  the  Ministry  of  Finance  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC), \nTsinghua University, and Peking University for the establishment and funding of a full-time \nRegional Research and Capacity Development Program on Water Security. In March 2011, \nTsinghua University and Peking University set up the Asia-Pacific Center for Water Security in \nBeijing to manage the program together with ADB. The program affirms ADB\u2019s commitment to \nregional cooperation by giving priority to knowledge sharing and mutual learning in key sectors. \nCollaboration with the PRC\u2019s centers of excellence is an important part of this commitment and \nmarks  a  new  partnership  between  ADB  and  the  PRC  in  knowledge  sharing  for  regional \ncooperation  and  integration.  The  proposed  research  and  capacity  development  technical \nassistance (TA) will support the start of program implementation; it received concept clearance \nfrom ADB Management in March 2011. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 May 2011. \n ", "2  \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Water security, along with food and energy security, is a fundamental need in Asia and \nthe Pacific, where water is increasingly scarce, pollution is rife, and extreme events could cause \nmore widespread disasters. Governments trying to deal with these challenges are significantly \nconstrained by a lack of reliable data, comprehensive analysis, and effective solutions. In most \ncountries, insufficient capacity, leadership, and regional cooperation keep decision makers from \nmaking the right investments and pursuing reforms to increase water security. \n \n6.  The program offers countries in the region a unique, first-time opportunity to pool their \nefforts and thereby achieve better results. It will be implemented through a partnership between  \nADB and the Asia-Pacific Center for Water Security, and it will support collaboration with the \ncenter\u2019s partner research institutes and capacity development centers, in Asia and the Pacific \nand elsewhere. \n \n7.  With support from the program, the center and its partners will conduct research to \nmeasure water security in the region and organize activities to develop the capacity to increase \nwater security. Program activities will benefit from strategic direction from ADB (through its \nWater for All Policy and WOP) and the APWF. The approach to increasing water security will be \ncomprehensive:  key  dimensions  (household,  economic,  urban,  environmental,  risks,  and \nresilience)  and  crosscutting  perspectives  (poverty  reduction,  governance,  food  and  energy \nsecurity, green growth, and regional cooperation) will be covered. \n \n8.  The program will also enable the center to join forces with partner institutes and centers \nin the region and to facilitate the creation and functioning of an international team that will \nupdate future editions of the AWDO. This joint effort will build on the earlier part-time research \nwork by ADB and knowledge partner organizations of the APWF that produced the first edition \nof  the  AWDO  in  2007  and  the  second  edition,  which  is  being  finalized  for  the  Second \nAsia-Pacific Water Summit in Bangkok in February 2012.  \n \n9.  The program will form an important part of the knowledge platform that ADB is building \nwith the PRC, and support regional cooperation among ADB\u2019s developing member countries \n(DMCs) as part of the WFP 2011\u20132020. Regional cooperation is a cornerstone of ADB\u2019s Water \nfor All Policy, and an area where ADB will intensify its activities under the WOP\u2019s guidance. The \nprogram  is  also  consistent  with  the  recent  focus  of  the  international  community \n(World Economic Forum, United Nations, and others) on water security and its links with food \nand energy security in the context of efforts to adapt to climate change. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The intended impact of the TA will be increased water security in Asia and the Pacific as \nexpressed in the guiding vision of increasing household, economic, urban, and environmental \nwater security, together with resilience and improved governance. Indexes for measuring water \nsecurity in these key dimensions are being finalized for publication in the second edition of the \nAWDO and will be improved further with support from the program. \n \n ", "  3\n11.  The outcome of the TA (the first in a series of expected contributions in support of the \nprogram) will be a well-established institutional capacity for water security research and capacity \ndevelopment at the Asia-Pacific Center for Water Security, working closely with its partner \ncenters of excellence in and outside Asia and the Pacific. ADB will guide the achievement of this \noutcome, so that its DMCs can invest appropriately and institute reforms to increase water \nsecurity,  helped  along  by  better  data  and  information,  comprehensive  analysis,  adequate \ninstitutional capacity, and regional cooperation. With ADB\u2019s guidance, the center will develop a \nmedium-term strategy for the program and the center, with emphasis on regional knowledge \nsharing. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  program  will  have  five  components.  It  will  (i)  gather,  analyze,  and  publish \ninformation about strategic water security issues and developments in the region, in the AWDO \nand  other  publications,  e-newsletters,  social  networking  and  other  websites,  and  a \npeer-reviewed journal; (ii) conduct research on water and related security issues in the region, \nwith partners; (iii) foster leadership in capacity development, including education and training; \n(iv) strengthen collaborative partnerships with centers of excellence in and outside the region; \nand (v) promote knowledge sharing through  conferences, workshops, dialogues, study visits, \ninternships,  fellowships,  and  other  forms  of  regional  cooperation.  The  TA  will  support  the \nprogram\u2019s start-up activities, with the following expected output. \n \n13.  Information  output.  The  Asia-Pacific  Center  for  Water  Security  will  facilitate  the \nformation and operation of an international team for the program with partner institutions in the \nregion, to conduct further research on water security in preparation for the third edition of the \nAWDO. Websites will be established for the center and the program to disseminate information \nin the region and beyond. Consultations will start on the development of a peer-reviewed journal \non water security in Asia and the Pacific, to be implemented after the TA. \n \n14.  Research output. A framework for further research on water security will be developed \nto support a third edition of the AWDO with improved indicators for measuring water security. A \ndatabase of water security\u2013related information and indicators will be designed in partnership \nwith ADB and with centers of excellence in and outside the region, including national research \ncenters in ADB\u2019s DMCs, and in the context of ADB\u2019s intention to establish an Asian water \ninformation system or service. The results of the pilot application of AWDO\u2019s water security \nindexes in selected river basins through the Network of Asian River Basin Organizations will be \nreported. A collaboration framework between the center and ADB will show how research in \nADB-funded investment projects of the WFP can contribute to the program. \n \n15.  Leadership  output.  The  Asia-Pacific  Center  for  Water  Security  will  organize  an \ninternational workshop on Asia\u2019s water-food-energy security nexus and make recommendations \nto leaders at the Second Asia-Pacific Water Summit in February 2012. The workshop will mark \nthe launch of the center and the program. \n \n16.  Partnership output. The center will conduct a series of consultation visits to potential \npartner institutions in research and capacity development in and outside the region, including \nnational research centers in DMCs, starting in Southeast Asia. These consultation visits are \nexpected to result in memorandums of understanding for collaboration between the center and \nits partners. A framework for further research on water security will also be developed to support \na third edition of the AWDO with improved indicators for measuring water security. \n ", "4  \n17.  Knowledge-sharing  output.  The  center  will  provide  opportunities  for  research \nassociates  from  DMCs  in  the  international  program  team  to  receive  on-the-job  training. \nExchange programs with partner organizations will be explored as part of the memorandums of \nunderstanding (para. 16). The center will explore synergies with ADB\u2019s country water sector \nassessments, ADB\u2019s planned Future of Water in Asia study, and the Asia-Pacific Water Forum\u2019s \nknowledge hubs initiative. An awards program will be designed to stimulate and recognize \nexcellence among researchers, practitioners, and leaders in water security in the region. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the People's Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund, to \nbe  administered  by  ADB.  The  Asia-Pacific  Center  for  Water  Security  and  its  partners  are \nexpected  to  make  additional  in-kind  contributions,  for  staff  input,  knowledge  products, \ninformation and data, and facilities, among others. Details of the cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB  will  execute  the  TA  through  its  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment, in cooperation with its East Asia Department (EARD) and the Water Community of \nPractice, and implement it through a partnership with the Asia-Pacific Center for Water Security. \nEARD, through ADB\u2019s PRC Resident Mission, will have a key role in TA implementation since \nthe program will make an important contribution to the knowledge platform that ADB and the \nPRC are building.  ADB will execute letters of agreement and advance payment facilities with \nthe center for the implementation of several activities, including the center\u2019s consultation visits to \nAsian countries, the international workshop, and on-the-job training for research associates. \nADB will also advise the center in the development of its medium-term strategy for the program.  \n \n20.  TA implementation will involve the Water Community of Practice and ADB\u2019s operations, \nstarting with EARD and the Southeast Asia Department, and will be designed in a manner that \nallows ADB clients and staff to contribute to the activities of the program and benefit in practical \nways from the results. For example, the Asia-Pacific Center for Water Security and ADB will \nexplore how projects of ADB\u2019s WFP 2011\u20132020 can become case studies in water security \nresearch, how knowledge can be shared among projects, and how the knowledge products that \nare produced can be applied in ADB-supported projects. \n \n21.  Most of the TA resources are allocated to travel-related costs that enable experts to \nmeet and work together in a variety of ways in the program. The Asia-Pacific Center for Water \nSecurity and its partners are expected to provide almost all the expert services through in-kind \ncontributions, rather than through the TA budget for consulting services. For the day-to-day \nmanagement of the program, the TA will require about 24 person-months of national (individual) \nconsulting  services,  including  those  of  a  program  communications  manager  at  the  center \n(individual, full-time) and a water security research analyst at ADB (individual, full-time). In \naddition,  the  TA  may  require  about  2 person-months  (individual,  intermittent)  of  services \nprovided by international resource persons with expertise in water, food, and energy security. \nThe consultants will be hired in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 3. ADB staff will also participate in the TA as speakers and resource persons in the \ninternational workshop on water security, and as advisers to the Asia-Pacific Center for Water \n ", "  5\nSecurity. The TA disbursements will conform to ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n22.  The implementation of the TA will be monitored by ADB through regular consultations \nwith the Asia-Pacific Center for Water Security and its partners. The TA output, good practices, \nand  lessons  learned  will  be  disseminated  through  ADB\u2019s  and  the  center\u2019s  websites,  and \npresented at regional forums and the Second Asia-Pacific Water Summit. \n \n23.  During the TA, the center and ADB will pursue supplementary funding from the People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  Regional  Cooperation  and  Poverty  Reduction  Fund  as  well  as \ncomplementary funding from other sources, including in-kind contributions from collaborating \npartner organizations in and outside the region.  \n \n24.  The TA is expected to run for 15 months, from August 2011 to October 2012. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the People's Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction \nFund for the Regional Program for Research and Capacity Development on Water Security, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \n  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and   \nDesignSummary  Indicatorsa  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nIncreased water  Indexes for household,  AWDO and other reports  DMCs invest more in \nsecurity in Asia and  economic, and urban water  on water security in Asia  increased water security \nthe Pacific  security, and for healthy rivers  and the Pacific  and improve the enabling \nand resilient communities,  environment by updating \ndeveloped by AWDO team  legislation, among others. \nOutcome      Assumption \nWell-established  Collaboration established  Partnership agreements  Mutually satisfactory \ninstitutional capacity  between the Asia-Pacific  between the center and  collaboration is \nfor the Regional  Center for Water Securityb  the collaborating research  established between the \nProgram for  and centers of excellence in  centers  center and research \nResearch and  and outside the region, with  centers in ADB\u2019s DMCs. \nDevelopment on  guidance from ADB   \nWater Security  Risk \nFunding from the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China \nRegional Cooperation and \nPoverty Reduction Fund \nstops. \nOutput      Assumption \n       \n1.
