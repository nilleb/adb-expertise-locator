During a pre-programming mission by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in February \n2007,  the  Government  of  Samoa  requested  advisory  technical  assistance  to  improve  its \ncapacity for strategic and development planning to enhance public sector performance and to \nreview and implement the Strategy for the Development of Samoa (SDS).1 The ADB mission \nwas conducted from 11 to 16 February 2007 to reach an understanding with the Government on \nthe objectives and scope of the technical assistance (TA), cost estimates, a financing plan, \nimplementation arrangements and the detailed terms of reference for consulting services of the \nTA. The proposed TA is included in the TA program for 2007 in the country operations business \nplan2 and  is  consistent  with  the  strategic  objectives  of  A  Pacific  Strategy  for  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank 2005\u20132009. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Samoa  has  made  substantial  progress  under  the  reform  program  initiated  by  the \nGovernment in 1994. The program included economic, governance, public sector and financial \nsector reforms, which have improved the efficiency of the economy and increased its output \nlevel. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average rate of about 3.2% during 2002\u2013\n2006. It is likely to continue to grow, with real annual GDP growth conservatively estimated at \n3% to 4% for 2007\u20132008. The Government is committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability \nby applying responsible fiscal and monetary policies to meet the pressures from a steadily \ngrowing economy. Samoa also is committed to further progress in widening and deepening its \nreform efforts to improve efficiency in order to sustain growth momentum.  \n \n3.  ADB supported the Government\u2019s reforms through TAs for strengthening capacity for \nmacroeconomic  analysis,  planning  and  policy  formulation,3 and  through  assistance  to  the \nfinancial sector4 and for public enterprise reforms.5 A loan and associated TA for small business \ndevelopment and micro credit was approved in October 2000,6 in conjunction with a series of \nTAs  for  privatization7 and  support  to  strengthen  the  corporate  governance  of  state-owned \nenterprises.8 Challenges for the Ministry of Finance (MOF), formerly the Treasury Department, \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 1 June 2007. \n2  ADB. 2007.

The Government deemed \nthat further support was necessary to (i) broaden and deepen policy analysis, and provide \nquality-control supervision in economic performance monitoring; (ii) develop strategic planning \nsectoral expertise in line ministries; and (iii) strengthen the links between line ministries and \nsectoral analysis. \n \n4.  Samoa  introduced  development  planning  in  1965  and  implemented  seven  5-year \ndevelopment  plans  by  the  end  of  1994.  An  implementation  framework  for  the  eighth \ndevelopment plan covering 1995\u20131997 was to be developed under Phase I of the ADB TA for \nmacroeconomic analysis, planning and policy formulation. In 1995, however, the Government \nadopted a strategic planning system that centered on the preparation of an annual statement of \neconomic strategy. Subsequently, the statements were reviewed every two years, and then \nevery three years. In the process, the statements became the Strategy for the Development of \nSamoa (SDS) as the 2002\u20132004 strategy was prepared. The vision for the current SDS 2005\u2013\n2007 remains focused on achieving an improved quality of life for all, in accordance with the \naims of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The theme for the SDS 2005\u20132007 is \n\u201cenhancing  people\u2019s  choices.\u201d  This  underscores  the  Government\u2019s  stated  commitment  to \nprovide all Samoans with access to opportunities by (i) strengthening the private sector through \nan  enhanced  enabling  environment  and  investment  that  helps  to  create  employment;  (ii) \ndeveloping agriculture to promote growth; (iii) increasing tourism within a balanced framework; \n(iv) developing the ability of communities to take advantage of increasing economic and social \nopportunities; (v) improving education, with an emphasis on raising numeracy and literacy levels; \nand (vi) increasing health standards. A midterm review of the current SDS was planned for 2006, \nbut was carried out in 2007. \n \n5.  The Economic Planning and Policy Division (EPPD) of MOF plays a leading role in \neconomic policy formulation and coordination of the overall national development effort. Its \nfunctions include instituting effective strategic development planning processes at the national \nlevel, generating medium to long-term plans, and developing a management framework for \ndetermining resource allocation policies and priorities. EPPD provides short-term economic \npolicy advice on fiscal and monetary issues based on good macroeconomic analysis. It also \ntakes the lead in project identification and planning, including project appraisal and preparation \nof sectoral programs and priorities, and in providing support for performance-based output \nbudgeting  throughout  the  government  system.  EPPD  is  responsible  for  the  design  and \nformulation of the Government\u2019s SDS as well as preparation of an economic statement provided \nas supporting documentation in the annual budget. To perform its designated functions more \neffectively, EPPD requires regular upgrading of skills, particularly in technical areas such as \neconomic statistics and modelling.  \n \n6.  EPPD has developed a conceptual framework for SDS 2008\u20132011. The new strategy is \nto  be  formulated  according  to  a  results-based  framework  in  support  of  management  for   \ndevelopment results. The proposed SDS also will support institutionalizing a planning process \nwith links to MDGs and other regional and international commitments. It will be structured \naround the broad strategic areas of economic and social initiatives, complemented by cross-\ncutting objectives. Economic strategies will cover commerce, manufacturing, finance, agriculture \nand tourism, while social initiative strategies will cover education, health, welfare and social \nservices, public administration, law and justice, utilities, and infrastructure and transport. The \ncross-cutting  objectives  relate  to  the  private  sector,  statistics,  legislation,  trade  and  the \nenvironment. The strategy will aim to strengthen links to the medium-term fiscal framework, \n ", "  3\nsectoral  plans,  annual  budget  allocations  and  departmental  corporate  plans.  An  impact \nassessment  of  sector  developments  over  the  past  10  years  will  assess  the  relevance  of \nstrategies  and  priorities,  as  well  as  corresponding  indicators,  to  determine  an  appropriate \nframework for management for development results. \n \n7.  Since 1995, ADB has provided several TA projects to EPPD to build its capacity in \nmacroeconomic analysis, policy and development strategy formulation, and project planning. \nThis support has strengthened national planning in Samoa, where ADB has played an important \nrole in helping the Government to access and apply best practice knowledge. All previous TAs \nhad significant capacity building components and were rated generally successful. Lessons are \nthat  (i)  institutional  strengthening  requires  long-term  support  and  the  mentorship  of  good \nadvisers, (ii) assigning a leadership role to counterpart staff helps to ensure ownership, and (iii) \nan appropriate mechanism to retain staff should be developed. According to the completion \nreport of the most recent TA,9 the TA design was relevant and the assistance was formulated in \nclose coordination with MOF. However, no mechanisms were included to ensure counterpart \ncommitment and durability of capacity building efforts. The TA achieved the outputs, but the \nimpact was affected by the counterpart agency\u2019s inability to (i) retain critical counterpart staff for \nbuilding long-term institutional capacity and (ii) ensure the counterpart staff\u2019s regular application \nof skills gained under the TA. EPPD also has received technical assistance from the Pacific \nFinancial Technical Centre to improve the treatment of government finance statistics, using the \n1986 A Manual on Government Finance Statistics.10 The South Pacific Community provided \ncapacity building on development of national accounts by attaching an EPPD staff member to its \nStatistics Section in Noumea, New Caledonia. The Cabinet approved recently the establishment \nof a Statistics Bureau, to be effective from 1 January 2008. The Statistics Unit of EPPD is likely \nto transfer to the bureau. The move aims to ensure that data collection is independent of policy \nadvice. The proposed capacity building under the new TA will help the bureau and EPPD to \nbuild on previous assistance to strengthen data collection and analysis that in turn will enhance \nthe quality of policy advice.  \n \n8.  EPPD has experienced critical staff changes recently. While the current team is well-\nqualified, it has limited relevant experience. As highlighted in the lessons of previous TAs, the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to sustaining the counterpart positions for the duration of TAs and \nbeyond is essential. Options for consideration include performance-based incentives and a \nbonding system11 for staff benefiting from TA capacity building. It is important to ensure that \nsuch measures have the desired result and do not stifle opportunities for EPPD to attract high-\ncalibre staff. The transfer of skills should target all EPPD staff in order to support long-term \nback-up. The TA will aim to build a bigger pool of qualified staff by extending the capacity \nbuilding component to include sector planners in line ministries, allowing a broader base for \nfuture transfers to EPPD. The 12-month duration of the TA will provide sufficient support for \neffective skills transfer. A lesson of previous TAs is that local ownership of the process is very \neffective in ensuring commitment. It is proposed therefore that EPPD\u2019s assistant chief executive \nofficer  be  the  project leader  for  TA  implementation.  The problem  of  high  staff turnover  is \ncommon to most small island countries, as capacity building increases the marketability of staff. \nHowever, the benefits of capacity building remain in the wider society by contributing to the \n                                                 \n9  ADB.  2005.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will assist the Government to improve and sustain its medium-term strategic \nplanning and monitoring. The emphasis will be on establishing a planning process that is in \nharmony with the medium-term fiscal framework, sectoral plans, annual budget allocations and \ndepartmental corporate plans, while also contributing to the achievement of MDGs and other \nregional and international commitments. The TA will (i) strengthen the strategic planning and \nmanagement of the economic sectors to achieve outcomes as set out in the SDS, (ii) strengthen \nthe institutional framework and capacity for developing and implementing poverty reduction \nstrategies and pro-poor policies within the framework of the SDS, and (iii) maintain capacity to \ngenerate  economic  statistics,  econometric  forecasts  and  models  for  policy  analysis  and \nmacroeconomic management. The expected TA outcome is improved capacity in planning and \nmanaging development through a consultative process.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will help translate the SDS vision into results-oriented objectives and targets \nwithin  a  medium-term  fiscal  framework  and  budget.  It  will  support  the  Government  in \nimplementing a participatory process, involving all stakeholders, that will measure attainment of \nthe results-oriented targets. The TA will also improve capacity in strategic development planning \nand macroeconomic and policy analysis to enhance planning processes with sound policy \nadvice.  \n \n11.  The proposed TA will assist the Government to (i) implement the SDS 2008\u20132011, (ii) \nstrengthen  capacity  in  macroeconomic  policy  analysis  and  data  gathering  and  statistical \nanalysis, (iii) conduct an impact assessment of sector developments over the past 10 years, and \n(iv)  enhance  the  capacity  of  EPPD  and  relevant  line  ministries\u2019  staff  for  implementing  a \nparticipatory approach for measuring results under the SDS objectives. \n \n12.  The main TA activities are grouped into four components as follows.  \n \n(i)  Component 1 supports the formulation of the monitoring indicators for the SDS \n2008\u20132011 and its implementation. It will assist with a the review of the SDS \n2005\u20132007 in relation to appropriate development indicators, and in preparing \nrelevant  policy  papers  to  support  the  new  SDS.  The  TA  will  also  help  the \nGovernment to develop realistic target indicators under an appropriate results \nframework in order to utilize the SDS as a suitable mechanism for management \nfor development results. \n(ii)  Component 2 strengthens macroeconomic policy analysis and data collection \nand statistical analysis by (a) reviewing and developing a methodology on data \ncollection,  analysis  and  interpretation  of  government  finance  statistics;  (b) \nreviewing  the  Revised  Minimum  Standard  Model-Extended  (RMSM-X)  or \nrecommending another appropriate and less data-intensive economic model; and \n(c) producing manuals and providing necessary training on economic statistics \nand economic modeling. \n ", "  5\n(iii)  Component  3  will  involve  conducting  an  impact  assessment  of  sector \ndevelopments  by  (a)  reviewing  SDS  impacts  over  the  past  10  years,  (b) \ndeveloping a basic sector framework for costing inputs, and (c) reviewing current \nsectoral work including sector plans. \n(iv)  Component 4 will enhance the capacity of EPPD staff and sector planners in \nrelevant  line  ministries  with  regard  to  strategic  development  planning  and \nmacroeconomic and policy analysis by (a) providing mentoring and skills transfer \nthrough  on-the-job  training;  and  (b)  designing  and  implementing  short-term \ntraining, including training of trainers. The TA also will assist the Government to \n(a) develop a relevant medium to longer term training program; and (b) prepare \nan options paper on how to retain staff, including a proposal for a program for \nyoung professionals to be piloted with MOF.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $625,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the \nbalance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $125,000, through the provision of counterpart \nstaff\u2019s  salaries,  office  accommodation  and  transport,  support  services,  and  facilitation  of \nconsultations. Appendix 2 provides details of the cost estimates and financing plan.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The TA is expected to begin in February 2008 and be completed by April 2009. It will \nrequire  24  person-months  of  consulting  services  (12  person-months  international  and  12 \nperson-months national). The consultants will provide expertise in development planning and \neconomic  sector  policy  formulation,  economic  statistics,  economic  modeling  and  economic \nanalysis. See Appendix 3 for an outline of the terms of reference for the consultants. The \nconsultants will be selected and engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Procurement \nunder the TA will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Equipment and systems procured under the TA will be handed to the Government on \ncompletion of the TA. The Government will ensure that all required counterpart staff, other \nhuman resources and support facilities will be available to the consultants in a timely manner.  \n \n15.  MOF will be the executing agency for the TA, with the chief executive officer (CEO) \nserving as the principal project coordinator. The project steering committee will consist of the \nCEO, the deputy and assistant CEOs of MOF, and representatives from key line ministries. The \nassistant CEO of EPPD will be the project leader for implementing the TA. The Government has \nagreed to provide adequate office space, counterpart staff, workshop and seminar venues, and \nlocal transportation.  \n \n16.  The consultants will prepare and submit to the Government and ADB (i) an inception \nreport one month after the TA starts which includes an issues paper outlining the approach, \nemerging factors and constraints, as well as a detailed TA work program; (ii) monthly reports \nindicating progress made and outstanding issues; (iii) a midterm report with a proposed short-\nterm training program; and (iv) a draft final report. \n \n ", "6   \nIV.
