THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nMongolia for the Ulaanbaatar Green Affordable Housing and Resilient Urban Renewal Sector \nProject. The report also describes (i) the proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the \nGreen Climate Fund (GCF), and (ii) the proposed administration of grants to be provided by the \nGCF and High-Level Technology Fund (HLTF)1 for the project, and if the Board approves the \nproposed  loans, I,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  to me  by the  Board,  approve  the \nadministration of the GCF loan, GCF grant, and HLTF grant. \n \n2.  The  project  will  deliver  sustainable  and  comprehensive  solutions  to  transform  the \nsubstandard, climate-vulnerable, and heavily polluting ger areas (paras. 3\u20134) of Ulaanbaatar city \ninto affordable, low carbon, climate-resilient, and livable eco-districts. It will leverage private sector \ninvestment to (i) deliver 10,000 affordable green housing units;2  and (ii) redevelop 100 hectares \n(ha) of ger areas into eco-districts.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Following the transition from a centrally planned to a market-based economy in 1991, \nMongolia has experienced rapid rural\u2013urban migration, mainly caused by (i) extreme climate \nevents, such as droughts and severe winter conditions (dzud), combined with poor veterinary \nservices and livestock management; and (ii) adoption in 2003 of a policy giving each citizen \naccess to about 700 square meters (m2) of urban land.4 Inadequate infrastructure investments, \nhousing policies, and urban planning regulations to accommodate the migrant population led to \nthe formation of vast peri-urban areas, named ger areas after the Mongolian yurts (gers) around \nUlaanbaatar\u2019s central districts.5 In 2017, the population of ger areas was estimated at 850,000 \npeople, that is 60% of the city\u2019s population of 1.46 million, and 30% of the country\u2019s population. \n \n4.  Ger areas are settlements of low- and middle-income households characterized by loosely \naligned plots, with irregular and unpaved pathways. Dwellings in ger areas are unserved detached \nsolid  houses  and  gers,6 poorly  insulated,  using  inefficient  coal  and  biomass-fired  stoves \ngenerating large amounts of carbon dioxide emissions and air pollution, especially during winter.7 \nMost households have land tenure. Poor sanitation, with most households relying on open pit \nlatrines, coupled with poor solid waste collection create unsanitary living conditions. Residents \nhave limited access to water, which is being supplied via water kiosks, and access to public space \n                                                \n1  Financing partner: the Government of Japan. \n2  Green housing maximizes climate (i) mitigation measures through the use of resource- and energy-efficient building \ntechnique  and  materials,  renewable  energy  systems,  and  operation  and  maintenance  to  maintain  building \nperformance and occupational health; and (ii) adaptation measures to reduce the vulnerability of ger area residents \nto harsh winters, flood events, hot summers, and soil pollution. \n3  Eco-district development is a highly integrated urban planning and development process at the neighborhood level, \nusing local responses to build green and sustainable development throughout the city. \n4  Average land plots measure 500 m2. In January 2017, the mayor issued an order to restrict the access of rural people \nwithout official permits to urban areas. In December 2017, the policy was extended until January 2020. \n5  The central districts of Ulaanbaatar are formed by apartment blocks with comprehensive utility services, including \ndedicated district heating, piped water supply, and wastewater collection and treatment services. \n6  Of the ger area population, 56% lives in solid houses and 44% in traditional gers. \n7  Air pollution causes health problems such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. World Bank. 2011. Air Quality \nAnalysis of Ulaanbaatar: Improving Air Quality to Reduce Health Impacts. Washington DC.  \n ", "2 \nand facilities, commercial areas, and economic amenities is lacking. 8 This situation (i) makes ger \nareas highly vulnerable to climate change impacts and  intensifies their carbon emissions; (ii) \nincreases the cost of doing business, discourages investors and developers, and inhibits both \neconomic integration and urban redevelopment processes; and (iii) affects vulnerable groups\u2014\nmostly women, children, elderly, and disadvantaged persons. Incremental growth and migration \nare increasing the population living in these poor conditions, because affordable housing options \nfor low- and middle-income households are limited. A 2016 survey by the Capital City Housing \nCorporation estimated housing demand at 150,000 units, while available affordable housing stock \nis about 4,000 units; with 60% of ger areas residents willing to move to apartment units if \nacceptable and affordable solutions are proposed.9 \n \n5.  In 1997, the Government of Mongolia and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) developed \na legal and policy framework for the housing sector. Under the National Housing Strategy, housing \npolicies were made demand-driven with new standards and regulations.10 In 2002, ADB approved \nthe first housing finance project, which introduced long-term mortgage lending to the banking \nsystem.11 In 2006, the Mongolian Mortgage Corporation was set up to create a pool of long-term \nfunds to stimulate a secondary mortgage market. Housing finance expanded from 2013 through \nthe government\u2019s 8% mortgage program. However, stringent mortgage access conditions and a \nlack of housing products for low-income households meant the mortgage program mainly served \nthe  upper  middle-income  households,  creating  an  oversupply  of  high-end  market  housing \nproducts. The program is currently suspended. Recently, the government and the Municipality of \nUlaanbaatar (MUB) initiated a series of programs to increase the supply of affordable housing \nunits, and support ger area redevelopment.12 The objective is to deliver up to 130,000 housing \nunits through the redevelopment of ger areas and the development of new areas. However, a lack \nof viable solutions, infrastructure investment, financing support to developers, and sustainable \nhousing  financing  mechanisms  have  resulted  in  these  programs  not  developing  into \nimplementable  plans.  The  few  residential  blocks  that  were  initiated  focused  on  lowering \nconstruction costs, to the detriment of community well-being and sustainable urban planning, and \nlacked energy-efficient and renewable energy features. \n \n6.  Through the ADB-financed Ulaanbaatar Urban Services and Ger Areas Development \nInvestment Program, MUB is extending basic urban and social services to upgrade economic \nhubs or subcenters in ger areas and provide an enabling environment for urban redevelopment \nand private and public investments.13 This provides an opportunity to implement onsite solutions \nfor households to access apartments within their communities by integrating housing solutions \n                                                \n8  Water consumption in ger areas is about 10 liters per capita per day, about half the minimum recommended by the \nWorld Health Organization in similar contexts. The cost is 2\u201310 times more than for residents of other areas. \n9  For medium and low income households, housing costs are considered affordable if rent or mortgage payments and \nutilities fees) is within 30% of gross monthly income. Affordability and willingness to pay of households below the \nseventh income decile are estimated at about MNT1.2 million ($490) per m2 for a 35 m2 apartment, while average \nmarket price was about MNT2.6 million ($1,070) per m2, based on the December 2017 currency exchange rate. \n10 In 1999, the government approved the Housing Law, National Housing Strategy, Housing Privatization Law, and \nCondominium Law. \n11 ADB. Mongolia: Housing Finance (Sector) Project. The project allowed the establishment of a market-based housing \nfinance system in Mongolia and the first mortgage finance law approved by the Parliament. \n12 MUB is also known as the Governor\u2019s Office of the Capital City Ulaanbaatar. Government initiatives included the (i) \nestablishment on 6 July 2013 of the State Housing Corporation, which was tasked with implementing 40,000 \naffordable housing units nationwide; and (ii) Rental Housing Program, approved by the Cabinet on 18 June 2015. \nMUB\u2019s main initiatives are the (i) City Housing Program, approved by Resolution 17/17 of the city council in 2014; (ii) \nAffordable Housing Strategy for Ulaanbaatar, approved on 28 May 2015 by the city council; and (iii) Capital City \nHousing Corporation, established in August 2015. \n13 ADB.

In addition, in November 2017 the government issued a resolution \nordering the Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM) to establish the first green development fund \nto promote green urban development and economy, making DBM a key partner to leverage the \nprivate  sector  for  green  housing  finance.14 International  housing  projects  and  Ulaanbaatar \nhousing and redevelopment experience show that a complete solution\u2014integrating housing, \ninfrastructure, urban development, and financing support to both the supply and demand sides\u2014\nis the best way to create a paradigm shift to improve access to green affordable housing, and \nresilient and low-carbon urban development.15  \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n7.  Impacts  and  outcome.16 The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  living \nconditions in Mongolia improved; and Ulaanbaatar is a safe, healthy, and green city that is resilient \nto climate change, and provides a livable environment for its residents.17 The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: access to low-carbon and climate-resilient eco-districts and green affordable \nhousing in Ulaanbaatar ger areas increased. The project is consistent with ADB's country \npartnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132020, and with the core themes of green, competitive, \nand inclusive cities of ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan.18 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n8.  The project will have three outputs: (i) resilient urban infrastructure, public facilities, and \nsocial housing units in ger areas constructed (public sector component);19 (ii) long-term financing \nto developers for low-carbon affordable housing, market rate housing, and economic facilities in \nger areas and to households for green mortgages increased (financial intermediation loan [FIL] \ncomponent); and (iii) sector policy reforms implemented and capacity strengthened. Output 1 will \ndeliver  (i)  green  social  housing  units  with  climate  adaptation  and  mitigation  features;  and \n(ii) resilient infrastructure, public space, and public facilities. Under output 2, up to $75.7 million \nof the GCF loan will be made available under the proposed FIL to enable an eco-district and \naffordable  housing fund  (EDAF) to  provide  long-term  debt financing  (denominated  in  local \ncurrency) to eligible commercial banks to support real estate developers\u2019 participation in the low-\ncarbon housing market, and produce affordable green mortgages. Output 3 will support (i) project \nimplementation;  (ii)  eco-district  feasibility  and  development,  policy  improvement  on  climate \nchange adaptation and mitigation, and improved supply and access to affordable green housing \nunits; (iii) detailed design and supervision; and (iv) sustainable green housing finance.20 \n                                                \n14 Based on the resolution, the Asset Management Company of the DBM (AMC-DBM) was tasked to manage the fund. \n15 Lessons were mainly derived from the following projects: (i) Mexican programs of Hipoteca Verde (green mortgage) \nand EcoCasa that provided low interest loans to developers for eco-affordable housing, (ii) Singapore\u2019s public\u2013private \npartnership design on a build-and-sell scheme, (iii) Thailand\u2019s Baan Eua-Arthorn project, (iv) Hong Kong\u2019s public \nhousing program, and (v) ADB\u2019s sector project to develop poor communities in the Philippines.

Eco-district parameters. The project eco-districts will be low-carbon, climate-resilient, \nmixed-income, and mixed-use areas with approximately 30% public space. The project\u2019s five \nphases will deliver about 20 eco-districts or subprojects, with each covering an average of 5 ha. \nPhase 1 include two core subprojects (10 ha) in Bayankhoshuu and Selbe subcenters, phases \n2\u20133 will have 8 subprojects (40 ha), and phases 4\u20135 will have 10 subprojects (50 ha). Each \nsubproject should be completed within 5 years.21 Phases 2\u20135 will identify and prepare a batch of \nsubprojects to be appraised based on eligibility and selection criteria, including financial and \nphysical parameters, formulated from the feasibility study of the two core subprojects.22 A detailed \ninfrastructure and architectural design produced for each subproject will ensure (i) adequate ratio \nfor social (15%), affordable (55%), and market rate (30%) housing units; (ii) balance between \npublic space and amenities, commercial areas, and residential units; and (iii) financial viability \nand rentability to allow private sector participation. The redevelopment process and housing \nconstruction will be undertaken onsite, and will be demand-driven. \n \n10.  Sector lending with financial intermediation loan component modality. The sector \nlending modality was deemed the most appropriate modality to achieve the project objectives \nbecause (i) a large number of subprojects in the sector are to be financed; (ii) the government \nand MUB have sector development plans (SDPs) to ensure the priority development needs of the \ncross sectoral policy improvement plan are met, and to guide project implementation; (iii) sector \nand institutional capacity analyses23 have shown that the government and MUB have adequate \ninstitutional capacity to implement the SDPs and the project; and (iv) policies applicable to the \nsector are deemed appropriate and will be improved, if warranted (paras. 5\u20136). The project will \nsupport the government and MUB in translating their SDPs into implementable investments, and \ncoordinated policies, actions, and institutional improvement.24   \n \n11.  Financial and institutional arrangements will facilitate the application of a blended finance \nstrategy using the FIL modality. The FIL modality will leverage private resources through the \nEDAF to be established and managed by the Asset Management Company of DBM (AMC-DBM) \non behalf of the Ministry of Finance.25 The EDAF will be established as a private investment fund \nstructured as a revolving fund, and will be used to onlend a portion of the GCF loan to participating \ncommercial banks. Based on eligibility and selection criteria, commercial banks will use the GCF \nloan proceeds to support housing supply and demand: (i) for supply, the EDAF will provide \nmedium-term loans to selected private developers, which will be combined with the developers\u2019 \nequities and additional loans by DBM and participating commercial banks to implement output 2; \nand (ii) for demand, the loan proceeds will be converted into low-cost long-term mortgages to \nhome buyers for purchases of the affordable housing and market rate housing units. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n12.  The project is estimated to cost $570.1 million. The investment component of the project \n                                                \n21 The phased approach will allow project parameters to be adjusted based on socioeconomic changes. \n22 Subproject eligibility and selection criteria are in para. 30 of the Project Administration Manual (PAM) (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 The SDPs are in the Sector Assessment (Summary): Water and Other Urban Infrastructure and Services (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) and the sector reform plan is in the section I.G of the PAM. \n25 The  EDAF  establishment  requirements  are  in  Schedule  5  of  the  Loan  Agreement:  Ordinary  Operations \n(Concessional) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Based on Government Resolution 135 \nand DBM Board of Directors Resolution 66 dated 23 August 2017, DBM established AMC-DBM and acquired a \nspecial  license  for  investment  management  services.  In  accordance  with  Financial  Regulatory  Commission \nResolution 241 dated 15 December 2017, AMC-DBM received the right to establish and manage investment funds. \n \n ", "5 \ncomprises outputs 1 and 3 and will cost $157.0 million (Table 1). Output 2, which will be delivered \nthrough an FIL component, will require an estimated $413.1 million. Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).26 The \ninvestment  component  will  support  civil  works,  with  necessary  equipment,  design  and \nconstruction supervision; and project management, including safeguards and due diligence. \n \nTable 1: Summary Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem   Amounta \nA.

Interest during construction has been computed (i) at \n2% per annum for the concessional ordinary capital resources loan, and (ii) at the 5-year US dollar fixed swap rate \nplus an effective contractual spread of 0.5%, a maturity premium of 0.1%, and  a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear (the interest and commitment charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan) for the ordinary capital \nresources loan. The financing charges for the Green Climate Fund loan used a service fee of 0.25% per annum \nand a commitment fee of 0.50% of the undisbursed portion of the loan. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n13.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. For the investment loan component, the \ngovernment has requested (i) a concessional loan of $20 million; and (ii) a regular loan of $60 \nmillion, both from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, to help finance the project. The concessional \nloan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2.0% per \nyear during the grace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan and project agreements. The regular loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and such other terms and conditions to be set forth in \nthe loan and project agreements. Based on the straight line repayment method, the average \nmaturity is 15.25 years. The government will relend the proceeds of the ADB loans to MUB on \nterms and conditions satisfactory to ADB, which will be combined with a $35 million MUB \ncounterpart fund to finance output 1 and a portion of output 3, i.e., project management support \nand detailed design. MUB will finance 35.5% of taxes and duties through exemptions, or will \nprovide funds to pay such taxes and duties in accordance with relevant laws and regulations. \nHLTF  will  provide  a  $3  million  grant  to  finance  a  smart  renewable  energy  and  building \nperformance control and monitoring system. The GCF will provide grant cofinancing equivalent \nto $50 million and loan cofinancing equivalent to $95 million, to be administered by ADB as an \naccredited entity.

For the FIL component, the government will invest about $75.7 million of the GCF loan \nproceeds into the EDAF to finance output 2. AMC-DBM will manage the EDAF, which will serve \nas the apex financial institution for the project funds to be channeled to financial intermediaries.27 \nIt is estimated that GCF loan proceeds, reforms in green finance under the project, will lead to \nDBM and other participating commercial banks to contribute $111.4 million, developers to finance \n$131.8 million in the form of equity participation, and beneficiaries to contribute $63.9 million from \ntheir own resources. Moreover, about $30.3 million of the GCF grant will be passed on to MUB to \nprovide performance-based grants through a green building facility to qualified private developers \nfor climate change mitigation and adaptation features. Climate mitigation is estimated to cost \n$81.7 million and climate adaptation is estimated to cost $146.6 million. ADB will finance 30.6% \nof mitigation costs and 37.5% of adaptation costs. Details are in the PAM. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 26). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  September 2018\u2013December 2026 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2026 \nEstimated loans and grants  30 June 2027 \nclosing date \nManagement \n                                                \n27 Apex mechanisms usually involve financial institutions through which donor-funded FILs are channeled to a second \nlayer of financial intermediaries, which will in turn onlend such loan proceeds to the subborrowers. \n ", "7 \nAspects  Arrangements \n(i)   Oversight body  A project steering committee headed by the Municipality of Ulaanbaatar (MUB), will \ncomprise government officials from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of \nEnvironment and Tourism, MUB relevant departments and agencies, Ministry of \nConstruction and Urban Development, Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM), and \nthe Capital City Housing Corporation, will be established to oversee project \nimplementation and provide strategic and policy guidance. \n(ii)  Executing agency  MUB \n(iii) Key implementing agency  DBM \n(iv) Implementation units  MUB project management office under the mayor of Ulaanbaatar for the public \nsector component and project implementation unit under the Asset Management \nCompany of the DBM (AMC-DBM) for the financial intermediation loan component. \nProcurement   For the financial intermediation loan component, developers will undertake \nprocurement of goods and civil works in accordance with commercial practices \nacceptable to the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nInternational competitive bidding (including  8 contracts  $40.49 million \nprocurement in loans to financial \nintermediaries for works/commercial practice) \nNational competitive bidding  5 contracts  $6.54 million \nCommunity procurement package  8 contracts  $0.20 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  1,350 person-months  $12.53 million \nQuality-based selection  42 person-months  $0.20 million \nAdvance contractinga  Advance contracting for recruitment of consulting services has been requested by \nMUB.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n16.  This  includes  comparative  analyses,  technical  specifications,  sustainability,  design \nmethods, standards, and cost estimates specific to ger areas and cold climate, and in line with \nnational standards. The specifications applied to eco-district design will match the principles of \nenergy and resource conservation and promotion of renewable energy best practices. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n17.  The project is economically viable. The resulting base-case economic internal rates of \nreturn of the core subprojects are 11.26% to 15.53%, exceeding the ADB prescribed minimum \ndiscount rate of 9%, confirming they are economically robust, with anticipated economic and \nhealth benefits arising from reduced environmental pollution that exceed the estimated economic \ncosts. Sensitivity analysis showed that the subprojects will remain economically viable under \nvarious scenarios. A financial analysis was carried out to assess the viability of the revenue-\ngenerating core subprojects to be financed using the GCF grant and loan proceeds under \noutput 2. The financial analysis was undertaken from the developer\u2019s perspective. Financial \nrevenues were derived from the sale of affordable housing and market rate housing units, as well \nas the sale of parking spaces and commercial lots for shops and offices. Base case financial \ninternal rates of return for the Bayankhoshuu core subproject is 20.75%, and for the Selbe core \nsubproject is 21.61%, exceeding the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 5.49%. \nSensitivity analysis showed that the core subprojects were vulnerable to decreases in revenues. \nUnder output 1, a financial sustainability analysis of MUB was conducted in lieu of estimating the \n ", "8 \ncore subprojects\u2019 financial rates of return. It confirmed MUB has the capacity to absorb the debt \nservicing and operation and maintenance requirements of the core subprojects. Financial due \ndiligence for the FIL component was carried out on XacBank as a sample representative bank in \nMongolia. XacBank qualifies as a participating bank and meets ADB\u2019s performance standards in \nterms of capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, and liquidity. The bank was \ndeemed financially viable and capable of meeting financial obligations, including debt service \npayments. A debt sustainability assessment was conducted and the bank\u2019s financial standing was \nassessed to be sufficiently robust to absorb the related credit risks of the subprojects as well as \nthe interest rate and exchange rate risks. The integrity due diligence carried out on XacBank \nshowed that there are no significant integrity risks. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n18.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, MUB, and DBM. The specific policy requirements are described in the PAM. \nThe financial management risk of MUB is moderate as it has established a fully functional project \nmanagement office that is currently implementing ongoing ADB projects (footnote 13). Also, MUB \ndeveloped and made operational a financial management system that incorporates ADB\u2019s loan \nand grant disbursement policies and procedures. Refinements to the system to accommodate \nchanges will be provided by the project capacity development support. The financial management \nassessment on AMC-DBM indicated two significant risks and corresponding mitigating measures: \n(i) as a newly established entity, AMC-DBM may lack the capability to manage the EDAF outright, \nand DBM has provided assurance that it will assign or engage qualified and experienced staff to \nAMC-DBM; and (ii) because AMC-DBM lacks prior experience in managing ADB disbursements \nand is not familiar with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to \ntime), AMC-DBM has committed to undertake the needed staff training to comply with ADB\u2019s loan \ndisbursement policies and procedures. Capacity building support, incorporating relevant financial \nmanagement  training,  will  complement  AMC-DBM\u2019s  planned  risk  mitigating  measures.  All \nprocurement  financed  by  ADB  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time).28 \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n19.  The project\u2019s direct beneficiaries include 10,000 households who will have access to \nhousing units and a total of about 17,000 households that will benefit from both living and working \nin 100 ha of ger areas developed into eco-districts. A total of 229 households, living within the \nperimeter of the core subprojects located in Bayankhoshuu and Selbe subcenters, will benefit \nfrom  onsite  redevelopment  through  the  voluntary  land  swapping  mechanism,  and  about \n2,000 households will benefit from living and working in fully developed eco-districts. To ensure \nfull realization of the benefits, the community participation plan (CPP) and social and gender \naction plan (SGAP) include a public awareness component, an education program, consultations, \nand participation activities.29 The CPP and SGAP will ensure continued consultation with and \nparticipation of the local communities and guide the community mobilization and consultation \nprocesses throughout implementation. \n \n                                                \n28 Universal procurement will apply per ADB. 2013.

The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The SGAP presents specific \neffective gender mainstreaming measures and outlines the strategies to address key gender \nconcerns with respect to access to services and livelihood opportunities to be provided by the \nproject, and to ensure that project components will be gender-responsive, appropriate, and \naffordable to its target users, especially vulnerable households. The CPP and SGAP also include \nmeasures to (i) facilitate and support the affected communities to avoid any loss of livelihood and \nbusiness; (ii) support vulnerable households that lack the financial means to afford better houses \nthrough skills training and linkages with job opportunities, training, and financial institutions; \n(iii) identify and integrate beneficiary community needs in project design documents; (iv) sustain \nawareness and support for the project by different stakeholders; (v) mobilize and organize \nbeneficiary community members to support the development and implementation of houses and \ninfrastructure; and (vi) facilitate effective monitoring and evaluation of the different aspects of \nthese components. Consulting services\u2014185 person-months of inputs (45 international and \n140 national)\u2014will  be  provided  to  support  MUB  in  establishing  the  mechanisms,  and \nimplementing and monitoring the CPP and SGAP. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n21.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.30 \n \n22.  Environment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination,  environmental \nmanagement plan, and environmental assessment and review framework were prepared in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.31 The anticipated environmental impacts \nduring construction include dust and noise, temporary traffic disturbance, and risks to community \nand workers\u2019 health and safety. The demolition of ger houses will not produce toxic waste as ger \nhouses are not made from toxic materials. Demolished housing materials will be disposed at \nlandfill sites approved by MUB. Affected plot owners and local communities were consulted on \nany  issues  or  concerns  they  have  with  the  project.  Mitigation  measures  defined  in  the \nenvironmental management plan, such as construction site management and regular monitoring \nof the environmental performance during construction and operation, will minimize the anticipated \nimpacts and construction-related health and safety concerns. Ensuing subprojects with similar \ncomponents are expected to be category B for environment as no category A subproject will be \nfinanced under the project. The carbon emission reduction estimated for the project is 200,000 \ntons of carbon dioxideequivalent per year, equal to 8 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent \n \nduring the project lifetime (40 years). The project will also contribute to black carbon reduction of \nabout 83 tons per year.32 \n \n23.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). For output 1, a resettlement framework has been \nprepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement for areas outside the project eco-\ndistricts\u2019 perimeters where involuntary resettlement impacts are expected. The resettlement \nframework will serve as a guide for screening project for involuntary resettlement impacts, and for \npreparation  and  implementation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans.  Infrastructure \nconstruction impacts outside the perimeters of the eco-districts\u2014such as widening of roads and \nconstruction of utilities to connect the eco-districts with main trunk infrastructure\u2014 will be avoided  \nor mitigated to the extent possible. The selection criteria for the redevelopment blocks include \n                                                \n30 ADB.

Activities with category A involuntary resettlement impacts will \nbe excluded. \n \n24.  Voluntary land swapping. The project will implement a demand-driven approach within \nthe perimeters of the project eco-districts, based on a voluntary land swapping mechanism, \nsupported by voluntary land swapping plans (VLSPs).33 The proposed resettlement is voluntary \nin nature as households will be provided with an option to participate or not.34 Each VLSP will \ncover landowners and non-landowners, with provisions for poor and vulnerable households as \nwell  as  for  affected  persons  under  ADB\u2019s  Ulaanbaatar  Urban  Services  and  Ger  Areas \nDevelopment Investment Program (footnote 13).35 Depending on the socioeconomic situation of \neach household, an affordable housing solution will be proposed through a land and asset swap \nagreement, a rent-to-own scheme, or an affordable rental scheme.36 Meaningful consultations are \nincorporated in the three stages of project cycle (identification, feasibility, and detailed design) to \nensure that potential beneficiaries are fully informed about the project and its implications, and to \nbuild a consensus among households living on a plot of land regarding whether or not to \nparticipate in the project. Such consultations will also help to address concerns of potential \nbeneficiaries, and any adverse impacts.37 If households on a plot decide not to participate after \nundertaking  consultations,  the  proposed  eco-district  will  be  redesigned  to  avoid  the  non-\nparticipating plot.38 Notwithstanding that the proposed resettlement for the project eco-districts is \nvoluntary, the VLSPs will be prepared and implemented to avoid or minimize impacts during the \ntransition period, and improve the standard of living of the potential beneficiaries, especially the \npoor and other vulnerable households. \n \n25.  A VLSP has been prepared for two core subprojects (Selbe and Bayankhoshuu). The \npotential beneficiaries of the two core subprojects include 78 landowners and 52 non-landowners \nin Selbe and 64 landowners and 35 non-landowners in Bayankhoshuu.39 The VLSP specifies the \n(i) principles of and procedures for voluntary land and/or asset swapping, based on transparency, \nconsistency, and fairness;40 (ii) meaningful consultation and participation during identification, \nfeasibility study, detailed design, and implementation to ensure that participation of landowners \n                                                \n33 The VLSP has been designed to maximize the project benefits to the local population by promoting an \u201cin-situ\u201d \nmechanism that preserves the fabric of communities and improves the quality of housing and urban infrastructure at \nan affordable cost. \n34 Specifically, a plot of land within the perimeter of an eco-district will be included in an eco-district redevelopment only \nif the residents of the plot (including owners and non-owners of the plot) are willing to participate. \n35 Affected people under other ADB projects implemented in ger areas, including ADB\u2019s ongoing Ulaanbaatar Urban \nServices and Ger Areas Development Investment Program, will have priority access to affordable housing with \nsubsidized mortgages, or rent and rent-to-own housing. \n36 For non-landowners or renters, priority access will be given to rental or social housing based on rent-to-own or rental \nschemes, depending on their income. For poor households (belonging to the income decile categories from 1 to 3), \nthe monthly housing costs (including rent and utility fees) will not exceed 25% of the monthly income of one \nhousehold. For the most vulnerable households, specific measures will be taken to ensure that they will not pay more \nthan they currently do for their rent and/or utilities services. Additionally, targeted employment and training program \nwill be implemented for poor households. \n37 Potential coercive practices are mitigated by the consultation process; verification by an independent external \nmonitor; and a grievance redress mechanism with documentation of consultation meetings, grievances, and actions \ntaken to address such grievances. \n38 The location, design, and shape of an eco-district is not predetermined. It will be developed and adapted based on \nthe willingness of households living on a plot to participate and can change until finalization of the detailed design. \n39 Based on the sample socioeconomic survey in Table 37 in the VLSP, it is estimated that there are 69 poor and \nvulnerable households. The numbers will be verified during detailed design. \n40 A written record of consultations and willingness to participate surveys undertaken during the identification and \nfeasibility study are presented in the VLSP. \n \n ", "11 \nand non-landowners is based on an informed decision that is free of intimidation or coercion; \n(iii) land and asset valuation methodology, which is based on replacement cost;41 (iv) support to \npotential beneficiaries, especially the poor and vulnerable households, through access to social \nhousing, cash grants, and livelihood improvement programs; (v) written record of ownership of \nthe apartment unit for landowners as well as other housing arrangements (including social \nhousing) for non-landowners; (vi) establishment of a grievance redress mechanism that requires \nproper documentation of grievances, and actions taken to address such grievances; (vii) budget \nrequirements and availability of funds for community engagement, green economy and business \nopportunity development, provision of a training and capacity building program for livelihood \nimprovement,  consulting  services,  management  and  administration  costs,  and  external \nmonitoring; (viii) institutional arrangements and support from project implementation consultants, \nwith clear roles and responsibilities; (ix) setting up of internal monitoring; and (x) engagement of \nan external monitor to validate the process and procedures set out in the VLSP, specifically the \nvalidation  of  the  negotiation  process.  VLSP  implementation  will  be  closely  monitored  and \nsupervised by ADB. The VLSP for the two core subprojects has been reviewed and cleared by \nADB, and disclosed to potential beneficiaries (on 27 May 2018, with a revised version disclosed \non 5 July 2018).42 Eco-district development for subsequent subprojects will have similar VLSPs. \n \n26.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No specific community of ethnic minority or ethnic \ngroup has been identified and no adverse impact is expected. \n \n27.  Financial  intermediaries  (category  B).  An  environmental  and  social  management \nsystem (ESMS) will be adopted. For core subprojects, an ESMS arrangement was prepared and, \nbased on a due diligence of XacBank, it was found that XacBank has adequate institutional \ncapacity  to  implement  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  procedural  and  substantive \nrequirements  contained  in  the  ESMS.  An  ESMS  will  be  developed  by  each  participating \ncommercial bank prior to loan disbursement. Financial intermediaries will ensure that there will \nbe no subproject classified as category A for involuntary resettlement and the environment. A \nsubproject under the voluntary land swapping agreement shall be considered for financing, \nprovided that a VLSP has been prepared for the subproject, disclosed to the beneficiaries, and \ncleared by ADB. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n28.
