During  the  2005  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) (the Government) confirmed its request for technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help the State Administration of Work Safety \n(SAWS) develop its strategy for improving coal mine safety. The TA is included in the country \nprogram for 2006.1 In February 2006, a Fact-Finding Mission was fielded to prepare the TA \nreport and hold discussions with representatives from the Government, SAWS, and the Zheng \nMei Group Company (ZMG), a key state-owned coal mine company, responsible for most  \nmining  activities  in  the  Zhengzhou  coal  mine  area.  Agreement  was  reached  with  the \nGovernment regarding the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, costs, \nand  financing  arrangements  and  the  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference.  The  TA  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Between 1990 and 2003, the total death toll from mine accidents in the PRC was 91,459 \npeople, or an average annual death toll of 6,532 people. In 2003, the world\u2019s coal output was \nabout 5 billion tons and the death toll from mine accidents was around 8,000 people, yet while \nthe PRC produced only 35% of the world\u2019s coal output, it accounted for 80% of the world\u2019s \ndeath toll from mine accidents. Also in 2003, average coal production per person-year was 321 \ntons in the PRC, 2.2% of the productivity in the United States and 8.1% of the productivity in \nSouth Africa, but the death rate per ton of coal produced was 100 times that in the United States \nand 30 times that in South Africa. Between December 2004 and February 2005, three major \ncoal mine accidents resulted in more than 100 deaths per event. In 2005, in an effort to reduce \nthe number of coal mine accidents the State Council established a ministry-level task force. \n \n3.  The PRC is the world\u2019s largest coal producer and consumer. The recent large increase \nin the country\u2019s demand for energy has resulted in rapid growth of coal consumption. The output \nof raw coal increased from 990 million tons in 2000 to 2.1 billion tons in 2004. With production in \nmany coal mines at 1.5 to 2.0 times higher than the mines\u2019 design capacities, and given the lack \nof safety measures and regulations, particularly for the large number of small coal mines, \naccidents occur frequently, leading to severe social and economic consequences. The safety \nsituation in coal mines, particularly in small mines with poor mine safety facilities, is deteriorating \nand the number of accidents is increasing. Each year, small mines, which tend to employ poor \npeople from rural areas, continue to account for 70% of all coal mine incidents. In response, the \nGovernment is increasing its efforts to improve coal mine safety. In 2005, the State Council \nissued the Special Stipulations of the State Council on Prevention and Control of Coal Mine \nAccidents, which propose measures2 for preventing and controlling coal mine accidents and \nfocus on strengthening the technical and institutional capacity of coal mines. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 16 June 2006. \n2  These include (i) imposing penalties on coal mines with hidden operational risks;  (ii) identifying situations under \nwhich coal mines have to be closed and risks to safety addressed; (iii) mandating the need for detailed measures \nand systems, including proper education and training for preventing major mine accidents; (iv) assigning main \nresponsibility for accidents to executives of coal mine enterprises as appropriate and imposing sanctions; and (v) \nassigning responsibility for accidents to local government units as appropriate and imposing sanctions. In addition, \nthe  following  measures  for  controlling  explosive  gases  were  also  proposed:  (i)  enhancing  research  and \ndevelopment in relation to measures for controlling gas, (ii) promoting the comprehensive development and use of \ncoal bed methane, (iii) sending supervision teams to 45 key coal enterprises, (iv) organizing experts to undertake \ndiagnoses operations in coal mines with serious gas problems, (v) carrying out appropriate measures to prevent \nproduction at levels that exceed capacity, (vi) performing technical upgrading for coal mines with dynamic gas \nphenomena, and (vii) popularizing the remote system for digital gas monitoring and control. \n ", "2   \n4.  Investigations  of  various  coal  mine  accidents  in  the  PRC  have  shown  that  gas \nexplosions and roof collapses account for more than 70% of all mine accidents and 74% of total \nfatalities. Serious accidents that resulted in more than 30 deaths were mostly due to gas \nexplosions. Methane3 is a serious hazard in coal mines because of its highly explosive nature. It \nmust be removed during, and sometimes prior to, actual coal mining operations to ensure \nworkers\u2019 safety. Even though the drainage of methane has been practiced for decades, current \npractices do not always meet national standards, hence the numerous fatal explosions. Roof \ncollapses are often caused by water inundation from aquifers and from water bodies created \nduring dewatering operations. Water management without appropriate training and lacking a \nproper understanding of geological conditions presents a serious threat to miners\u2019 safety. \n \n5.  In 2003, 4,143 mine accidents killed 6,434 people. Of these, 531 accidents that killed \n892 people occurred in key state-owned mines4, accounting for 14% of all the deaths; 607 \naccidents that killed 881 people happened in local state-owned mines, accounting for 14% of \ndeaths; and 3,005 accidents killing 4,661 people took place in mines owned by small towns and \nvillages, accounting for 72% of deaths. The high death toll in the latter is particular cause for \nconcern. \n \n6.  The Zhengzhou mining area in Henan province has been selected for a pilot study to \ndevelop  a  comprehensive  approach  addressing  coal  mine  safety.  It  will  serve  as  a \ndemonstration site that can be replicated throughout the PRC. The Zhengzhou coal mine area is \na  typical  PRC  coal  mine  area  in  terms  of  its  safety  conditions  and  problems  and  mining \ndevelopment history. ZMG, a key state-owned coal mine company, is responsible for the major \nmining activities in the Zhengzhou coal mine area, together with a large number of village and \ntownship coal mines administered by the Coal Administration Bureau of Zhengzhou Municipality \n(CABZM). In 2000, the Zhengzhou coal mine area had more than 900 small mines. This number \nwas reduced to 513 mines in 2004. The raw coal output of the Zhengzhou mining area was 41 \nmillion tons in 2004, using more than 250,000 workers. On 20 October 2004, a gas explosion \naccident occurred in ZMG\u2019s Daping Mine that killed 148 workers. \n \n7.  By  addressing  safety  issues,  particularly  in  small  coal  mines,  the  TA  will  have  a \nsignificant impact on poverty reduction. Estimates indicate that more than 80% of coal miners \nare poor and uneducated. For example, fewer than 2% of workers in the Zhengzhou coal mines \nhave completed high school or have higher qualifications. Also, most miners work as temporary \nday workers and therefore lack job security. Because of their poor safety records and low \nmining efficiency, the Government plans to close most small coal mines, which will have a \nsignificant impact on workers\u2019 welfare. Local governments are extremely concerned about the \nreemployment of workers who will be displaced by the closure of small coal mines. Thus, \nmeasures need to be taken to provide training for these workers to improve the safety record of \nsmall coal mines and/or to prepare them for employment in large, modern coal mines or in other \nemployment alternatives.5 Both ZMG and CABZM have supported measures to improve coal \nmine safety and poverty reduction. \n                                                 \n3  Methane gas forms at the same time coal forms and is absorbed in the coal seam. The gas is released as a result \nof temperature and pressure changes when underground coal is mined or exposed to surface conditions. Methane \nreleased through wells drilled from the surface into underground coal seams is referred to as coal bed methane, \nwhile coal mine methane refers to methane released through mine shafts during underground coal mining \noperations. \n4  Coal mines in China are classified into (i) key state-owned mines (large, generally modern, and are under the \nprovincial government control); (ii) local state-owned mines (smaller, partially mechanized, administered by the \nprovincial governments); and (iii) town and village mines (small and use manual mining techniques, run by local \ngovernments and private individuals). \n5  ADB is also funding ADTA-4680-PRC (ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for \nAlternative Livelihood Options to Facilitate Coal Sector Reforms. Manila) to address this concern.  \n ", "  3\n \n8.  By reducing gas explosions, the TA will also have substantial environmental benefits. \nCoal mines in the PRC have high coal bed methane (CBM) and coal mine methane (CMM) \ncontent. Most of the methane removed during mining operations is not used as an energy \nsource, but is emitted into the environment as a greenhouse gas. Coal mines in the PRC \nreleased approximately 6 billion cubic meters of methane into the atmosphere in 2003 and are \nexpected to release approximately 10 billion cubic meters per year by 2010. As a greenhouse \ngas, methane is approximately 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Henan province is \none of the major coal-producing areas in the PRC and produces high methane emissions \nbecause of its geological conditions. The TA will assess how methane can be commercially \nextracted and used as an economic source of energy that will be distributed to households and \nindustries.  Efficient  extraction  and  utilization  of  methane  will  help  reduce  greenhouse  gas \nemissions, improve the safety of coal mines, and reduce domestic use of coal. \n \n9.  The  Government\u2019s  development  objectives  include  containing  the  worsening \nenvironmental pollution and improving coal mine safety to demonstrate that rapid economic \ngrowth and a cleaner environment are compatible. SAWS will strengthen its control over coal \nmine safety by issuing regulations. Monitoring and enforcement will also be improved. ADB\u2019s \noperational strategy in the PRC aims at helping the country achieve economic growth in an \nefficient, equitable, and sustainable manner. ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy in the PRC includes \ndeveloping cleaner energy sources, renovating and retrofitting existing facilities to improve \nefficiency and reduce emissions, promoting the corporatization and commercialization of energy \nutilities, and introducing pricing and tariff reforms. This is complemented by ADB\u2019s strategy for \nthe environment sector, which supports the use of economic, supply-side, and other measures \nto ensure the sustainable utilization of natural resources; promotes market-based pricing; and \nencourages cost recovery and better disclosure of information about environmental issues. The \nGovernment has a plan to improve coal mine safety by 2008 and the TA is a major part of this \neffort. With joint efforts by SAWS and ADB, ZMG and CABZM will seek approval from the \nGovernment to develop a project that will promote coal mine safety. By carefully developing a \ncoal mine safety strategy and encouraging active policy dialogue, the TA is consistent with and \nprovides  support  for  SAWS\u2019s  objectives  and  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector \nstrategy. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  an  improvement  in  the  safety  and  environmental \nsustainability of coal mining in the PRC. Its outcome will be the adoption and implementation of \na strategy for enhancing safety in coal mines. The strategy will consider how to (i) enhance the \nprevention  and  control  of  accidents,  (ii)  strengthen  safety  management  in coal  mines  and \npromote policy reforms, and (iii) reduce the release of methane gas into the environment. The \nTA  will  help  meet  the  Government\u2019s  target  of  addressing  safety  problems  in  coal  mines, \nparticularly small coal mines, by 2008. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The outputs of the TA will be:  \n(i)  a coal mine safety strategy that will include a proposal for restructuring coal mines, \nparticularly small coal mines, to improve coal mine safety by means of various reform \nmeasures; and \n ", "4   \n(ii) a coal mine safety action plan up to 2020 for the Zhengzhou mining area that will \ninclude (a) an assessment of the technologies for accident prevention and control, \nparticularly  drainage  technologies,  and  for  improving  CBM  and  CMM  utilization, \nmonitoring, and control; (b) a strategy for public dissemination of the TA\u2019s findings \nand  recommendations,  including  comprehensive  training  courses;  and  (c)  the \nidentification and prioritization of candidate coal mine safety projects for possible \nADB financing, and based on the recommendation, an evaluation of the pilot project.  \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented in close consultation with all stakeholders and interested \nparties, including targeted miners and potential private sector investors. The TA will be carried \nout in three parts. In part I, the consultants will undertake a detailed background study to gain a \nthorough understanding of the issues related to coal mine safety that will include data gathering \nand preliminary analysis. During part II, the consultants will conduct an international seminar to \nidentify the main issues to be addressed to achieve the TA\u2019s objectives, reform measures \nrequired to address these issues, and suitable international best practices. Under part III, the \nconsultants will analyze in detail the issues relating to coal mine safety and assess the selected \ncoal  mine  safety  pilot  project.  The  consultants  will  make  assessments  from  technical, \ninstitutional,  social  and  poverty  impact,  economic,  pricing,  financial,  and  environmental \nviewpoints. The consultants\u2019 recommendations will be discussed at a workshop with the main \nstakeholders. The consultants will organize a final workshop with the main stakeholders to \ndisseminate the TA\u2019s findings and recommendations.  \n \n13.  The international seminar will introduce and evaluate international experience in related \nareas and its relevance in the PRC context, to be incorporated into the coal mine safety \nstrategy. International and national experts will be invited to present papers and participate in \nthe  discussions.  After  the  seminar,  the  consultants  will  prepare  a  report  summarizing  the \ndiscussions and identifying issues relevant to the PRC context. The TA includes a 2-week \nprogram of international field study to expose selected PRC personnel to the latest trends and \ninternational best practices in coal mine safety. Participants will include personnel from SAWS, \nZMG, and other government agencies involved in policymaking and in the implementation of \ncoal mine safety. The consultants will consider the particular needs of study participants and \nprepare a study proposal for ADB approval that specifies the (i) objectives of the field study \nprogram, (ii) institutions to be visited, (iii) agenda for discussions and training, (iv) name and job \ndescription of each person nominated to participate in the field study, and (v) costs. Selection \nprocedures for the international field study program will have to be acceptable to ADB and take \neconomy and efficiency considerations into account. At the end of the field study program, the \nparticipants will submit a group report to ADB summarizing the findings and observations, \nincluding an initial assessment of which practices and technologies could be applicable to PRC.  \n \n14.  The major assumptions in relation to the successful implementation of the TA include \ncontinued emphasis on improving the safety of coal mining; adequate counterpart support; \nadequate  and  timely  provision  of  data  and  submission  of  required  studies;  and  active \nparticipation by stakeholders in workshops, seminars, surveys, and/or field visits and in the pilot \nproject.  In addition,  the  Government\u2019s continuing  commitment  to  coal  sector  reforms,  tariff \nreforms and rationalization, and transparent regulation is necessary for the success of the TA. \nThere is a risk that the demand for coal will continue unabated and that small coal mines will \nhave large incentives to increase production, even if mining conditions are unsafe. Efforts will be \nmade to ensure that competent consultants will be recruited in time. SAWS is committed to \nnecessary  reforms  and  has  agreed  to  provide  adequate  counterpart  support  and  data  as \nneeded.  Close  coordination  will  be  maintained  among  the  consultants,  executing  and \nimplementing agencies, and ADB. \n \n ", "  5\n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $850,000 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB \nto finance $600,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. The Government will finance the balance of the TA costs, equivalent to $250,000 \n(29%) through the provision of in-kind contributions (in the form of office space and facilities and \nsalaries for counterpart staff) and funding of part of the cost for the 2-week field study program. \nThe detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  SAWS will be the executing agency for the TA and ZMG will be the implementing \nagency. ADB will engage international and national consultants, in consultation with SAWS, \naccording to its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and its \nBorrowers. A full technical proposal will be requested by ADB and consultants will be recruited \nusing the quality- and cost-based selection method. An estimated total of 55 person-months of \nconsulting services will be required: 10 person-months for international consultants and 45 \nperson-months for national consultants. The international consultants will have expertise in (i) \ncoal mine safety, (ii) institutional analysis, (iii) economic analysis and analysis of coal prices and \nother  tariff  regulations  and  reforms,  (iv)  financial  analysis,  (v)  poverty  impact  and  social \nassessment, and (vii) environmental assessment. The national consultants will have the same \nexpertise. The outline terms of reference for consultants are given in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  SAWS will establish a counterpart team with representatives from SAWS and ZMG. The \ncounterpart team will interact closely with the consultants during implementation of the TA. \nSAWS  will  also  establish  a  steering  committee  comprising  senior  SAWS  officials  and \nrepresentatives from other government organizations and agencies involved in formulating and \nimplementing coal mine safety. The steering committee will be the apex body that will convey \nand  interpret  the  Government\u2019s  views  on  policy  issues  and  generally  oversee  TA \nimplementation. The counterpart team members will interact with members of the steering \ncommittee to seek clarification of issues and matters that fall outside the purview of SAWS. \nSAWS will provide interpreters, local transportation, and office space equipped with suitable \noffice facilities in Beijing. ZMG will provide interpreters, local transportation, and office space \nequipped with suitable office facilities in the city of Zhengzhou. Some of the office equipment will \nbe financed under the TA and will be procured by the international consultants in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  This  equipment  will  be  handed  over  to  SAWS  upon \ncompletion of the TA. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 9 months beginning on 1 December 2006, with an \nexpected completion date of 30 August 2007. Information on the progress of implementation \nand  on  TA  outputs  will  be  disseminated  through  the  TA  information  dissemination  and \nawareness program, including the special web site that is to be developed. The outcome of the \nTA will be subject to evaluation by both ADB and the Government in accordance with their \nrespective evaluation policies and requirements.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Coal Mine Safety Study, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risk \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nImprovement in coal  Decreased coal  National statistics and coal  \u2022  The Government remains \nmine safety and  mine accidents   mine data  committed to making coal \nenvironmental    mining safe and promoting \nsustainability  Increased use of methane  the use of coal bed \n  from coalmines  methane and coal mine \nmethane \n\u2022  TA action plans are \nimplemented effectively \n \nRisk \n\u2022  Continuing high energy \nintensity of the economy \nrequires higher coal output \nand overlooks safety \nconsiderations \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nAdoption and  Improved mine safety  Report by SAWS on  \u2022  SAWS is committed to \nimplementation of the coal  procedures  implementation of the action  implementing needed \nmine safety strategy    plan  reforms and improvements \n  Proposed policy reforms    \u2022  TA recommendations are \n  and rules and regulations  Report by the Zheng Mei  disseminated to all \nGroup Company on the results  concerned parties and \nof implementation of the action  agreement on appropriate \nplan in the pilot coal mine area  reforms and required \nmeasures is reached  \n\u2022  Recommended safety \nmeasures are technically \nand financially feasible \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \nCoal mine safety strategy   Coal mine safety strategy  Laws, rules, and regulations  \u2022  Timely access to records, \n  is submitted to and    information, personnel, \n  accepted by SAWS  Records and statistics  and relevant geographic \n      sites is given \nCoal mine safety action  Coal mine safety action  International publications,  \u2022  Active participation of \nplan up to 2020 for the  plan is submitted to and  international safety standartds   stakeholders in \nZhengzhou mining area,  accepted by SAWS and    workshops, seminars, \nincluding:  the Zheng Mei Group  Consultants\u2019 report  surveys, and/or field visits \n(a) an assessment of the  Company     and in the pilot project \ntechnologies for accident    Review missions   \nprevention and control,     \nparticularly drainage   \ntechnologies, and    \nof improvements in coal \nbed methane and coal \nmine methane utilization, \nmonitoring, and control;  \n(b) a strategy for public \ndissemination of the TA\u2019s \nfindings and \nrecommendations, \nincluding comprehensive \ntraining courses; and  \n(c) the identification and  \n ", "                                                                                  Appendix 1          7 \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risk \nprioritization of candidate       \ncoal mine safety projects \nfor possible ADB \nfinancing, and based on \nthe recommendation, an \nevaluation of the pilot \nproject. \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs   \n   \nPart I: Preliminary Analysis (completed by March 2007)  ADB: $600,000 \n1.1  Assess current mine safety protection policies and regulations and enforcement and  \u2022  Consultants: $482,550 \n  monitoring procedures.  \u2022  Equipment: $15,000 \n1.2  Conduct field visits and evaluate current mine safety protection and monitoring   \u2022  Training, seminars and \n  technologies and pitfalls.
