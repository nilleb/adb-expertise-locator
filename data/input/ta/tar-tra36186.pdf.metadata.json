As part of their effort to revive regional cooperation initiatives, the governments of the \nBrunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN1 Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) \nhave decided to improve the coordination and monitoring of regional cooperation activities and \nof their projects. After inviting the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to become the BIMP-EAGA \nregional development advisor, the senior officials of the participating countries requested ADB \nto  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  that  purpose.2  A  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  the \nsubregion from 30 August to 11 September 2002 to discuss the proposal with concerned \nstakeholders in the public and private sectors. Concurrence of government authorities in each \nparticipating  country  was  obtained  concerning  the  objectives,  scope,  cost,  implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference for the TA.3 The TA is included in the Subregional \nCooperation Strategy and Program for Southeast Asia in 2002.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  After  it  was  created  in  1994,  BIMP-EAGA  rapidly  became  an  active  economic \ncooperation subgrouping in the Asia and Pacific region.5 Originally, the governments adopted a \ndecentralized structure to manage BIMP-EAGA activities through national secretariats (NSs) in \nthe four countries, without a central body. The governments also anticipated that the private \nsector would be the engine of growth in the region, with the government expected to provide an \nenabling environment. In this context, BIMP-EAGA private sector representatives set up the \nEast ASEAN Business Council (EABC) with a secretariat to coordinate private sector activity in \nthe subregion.  \n \n3.  Based on the above, BIMP-EAGA adopted an institutional framework comprising \n \n(i)  working groups representing the priority sectors of cooperation; \n(ii)  NSs that represent their respective countries\u2019 interests in the subregion to ensure \nthat in-country BIMP-EAGA initiatives are maintained, and to coordinate BIMP-\nEAGA-related in-country projects and activities;  \n(iii)  the Ministerial Meeting and the Senior Officials Meeting (SOM), which are the \nhighest  level  for  consultation  and  decision  making  among  the  participating \ncountries and the private sector; and  \n(iv)  the EABC,6 which was given \u201cfifth country status\u201d to better catalyze the BIMP-\nEAGA private sector. 7 \n \n4.  Soon after the creation of the initiative, as cooperation activity increased and a larger \nnumber of stakeholders became involved, a growing number of increasingly complex cross-\nsector  issues  surfaced.  Subsequently,  as  the  Asian  economic  crisis  deepened  in  1998, \nsubregional  priorities  gave  way  to  national-level  concerns,  and  strong  political  support  for \nregional cooperation could not be maintained. In the absence of strong public sector support, \nthe  capacity  of  the  private  sector  to  spur  growth and economic activity in the subregion was  \n \n                                                 \n1  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). \n2  10th Senior Officials Meeting, Manado, Indonesia, 9 and 10 August 2002. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities  in June 2002. \n4  ADB. 2002. Subregional Cooperation Strategy and Program Status Report, Southeast Asia, IN.225-02, Manila. \n5  Early manifestations of interest to develop commercial ties were dampened by the Asian economic crisis. \nSignificant successes were noted, however, in the opening of air and sea links and in the growth of tourism. \n6  The EABC Secretariat was launched on 19 November, 1996.  \n7  A more detailed description of the elements of the BIMP-EAGA institutional framework is in Appendix 1. ", "2 \nreduced. After the Asian economic crisis subsided, the governments reviewed the existing \ncoordination arrangements as part of their effort to revive the BIMP-EAGA initiative. They \nagreed to the need for more systematic coordination of the mechanisms that would strengthen \nthe  framework  supporting  private  sector  activity  in  the  subregion.  Implementation  of  this \nagreement responds to three major concerns. \n \n5.  First is the need to tackle the development of the subregion from a new project-based \napproach. With this, delivering rapidly tangible results is expected to help regain the confidence \nof the stakeholders and demonstrate to interested investors and development partners that \nBIMP-EAGA has potential for profitable investments. Weak structures for project preparation, \ncoordination, and implementation deprive the BIMP-EAGA initiative of much of its substance. \nThis results from the absence of a coordinated capacity to (i) identify and formulate viable \nprojects expected to generate benefits rapidly (i.e. projects with a short gestation period); (ii) \navail of clear and effective mechanisms to sustain a dynamic pace of project implementation; \n(iii) address constraints that may arise in the course of project construction; and (iv) mobilize \nresources for project financing. In addition, little information is available in the different BIMP-\nEAGA areas on sector specific activity to assess needs, as well as to design, coordinate, and \nimplement the necessary initiatives or monitor the changes in the economic environment of \nprojects. This also contributes to inefficiencies in the formulation of quick-gestation projects. \nAccordingly,  the  participating  governments  agreed  to  the  creation  of  a  Central  Project \nFacilitation Unit (CPFU) 8. \n \n6.  The  CPFU  is  expected  to  link  all  BIMP-EAGA  NSs  and  undertake  prioritization, \nimplementation,  and  monitoring  of  BIMP-EAGA  subregional  development  projects.  Project \nimplementation and monitoring will essentially involve persistent follow-up activities and an \nassessment of the compliance by the concerned governments and private sector groups with \nthe terms and conditions of the project/s. All staff and operations expenses of the CPFU are \nexpected to be charged to the Government of Sabah. Although the State Government of Sabah \nhas offered to host the unit, discussions are still ongoing to determine the final location of the \nCPFU. The government of Malaysia is fully aware of the need to resolve the pending questions \nprior to the fielding of the consultants.  \n \n7.  Second,  at  the  country  level,  the  coordination  framework  for  sustained  regional \ncooperation is weak, pointing to the need for a strengthened coordination structure to address \nthe major constraints. The effective level of authority in the central government now varies from \none country to the other. While the senior officials and NSs are positioned at levels that provide \nsome capacity for oversight and coordination within ministries, their links with senior levels of \ngovernment  (i.e.,  ministers,  cabinet  members)  are  tenuous  at  times.  Additionally,  NSs  are \nsometimes at pains to effectively support in-country BIMP-EAGA initiatives that need to be \nimplemented  by  several  government  agencies  in  a  coordinated  manner.  Originally,  the \ncoordination of BIMP-EAGA activities depended on a comparatively informal country framework. \nHowever, NS resources have not been upgraded systematically, although regional cooperation \nhas become an increasingly popular development tool, and regional development activities have \nincreased in number and complexity. In consequence, the cooperation and coordination output \ncan decrease as the number of regional cooperation activities grows, despite the strength of \npolitical commitment. The organization and conduct of meetings are still based on formal and \ntime-consuming protocols, at a time when stakeholders increasingly use faster information \nexchange and decision-making processes. Therefore, developing the capacity of the CPFU \n                                                 \n8  Informal Senior Officials Meeting, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, 18\u201319 September 2002. The Federal State of Sabah, \nMalaysia is expected to host CPFU. Details on CPFU are provided at Appendix 1. ", "    3 \nshould enhance the coordinating role of the NSs. With this, the CPFU will be able to relate \neffectively to the national organizational frameworks in the participating countries. \n \n8.  Third, BIMP-EAGA lacks a suitable, modern information preparation and dissemination \nmechanism. Such a system is not consistently available in all NSs, working groups, the EABC, \nand other private sector organizations. Where it is, there is no capacity to address needs in a \ncoordinated manner. Hence, most of the time, meetings are one of the few opportunities when \ninformation on BIMP-EAGA activities and decisions can be disseminated to media, which has a \ncapacity that varies according to the quality of the media channels available at the different \nvenues. This makes it difficult to generate consistent and regular flow of information of a quality \nthat can attract and satisfy concerned stakeholders in either the public or the private sector.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The TA will help define the requirements and build up the capacity of the newly created \nCPFU and develop a supportive and dynamic framework for the coordination of BIMP-EAGA \nactivities. The TA framework is in Appendix 2.  \n \n10.  The assistance provided is expected to directly improve coordination mechanisms within \nand between the public and private sectors of BIMP-EAGA. It is also expected to improve the \nflow and quality of information between the concerned public sectors and the private sector in \nthe subregion through enhanced coordination and preparation. This is expected to result in an \nincrease of the resources contributing to regional cooperation through (i) better preparation of \npolicies  and  projects  directly  related  to  the  development  of  the  subregion;  (ii) improved \nefficiency in the implementation of projects; and (iii) greater interest of concerned government \nand external assistance agencies, as well as private sector entrepreneurs, in becoming partners \nin the development effort. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  A first step towards strengthening the role of the public sector was the decision of the \nBIMP-EAGA governments to establish the CFPU after discussing concerns on cooperation \nmechanisms at the 10th SOM in August 2002 and at the informal SOM in September 2002. The \nTA will include the following activities. \n \n12.  Provide a project facilitation framework. Building up the capacity of the CPFU is \ncritical for the success of the regional cooperation effort. This will be carried out through training \nin such activities as identifying, prioritizing, developing, implementing, and monitoring regional \ndevelopment projects under the guidance of the SOM for preparation and implementation. \nSpecial attention will be paid to (i) identifying and structuring high priority, pragmatic, and quick- \ngestation initiatives, to generate tangible outcomes as an incentive for increased cooperation; \n(ii)  monitoring  the  implementation  performance  of  regional  cooperation  activities; \n(iii) troubleshooting and resolving implementation bottlenecks; and (iv) mobilizing financial and \ntechnical resources. Considering the importance of this component in the success of the TA, \ntraining in this component will be dispensed to CPFU staff, and also to the NSs, as well as the \npreparation  of  projects  submitted  by  the  BIMP-EAGA  working  groups;  and  the  planning, \norganization, and conduct of regional conferences, participatory workshops, and consultations. \nThe project  facilitation  framework will  also  include  the  capacity for  short-term  specialists  to ", "4 \nrespond to unexpected demands, conduct short-term trade and investment missions, as well as \nprepare short business diagnosis studies related to specific BIMP-EAGA sectors where the lack \nof information on the corresponding economic environment prevents project development.  \n \n13.  Enhance  communication  mechanisms  between  the  CPFU  and  concerned \ngovernment agencies. The CPFU will work in close coordination with concerned NSs of each \nparticipating country. Accordingly, the NSs\u2019 capacity will be assessed and strengthened as \nappropriate, to ensure that the CPFU and NS coordination mechanisms are consonant. In \nparallel, NSs will be encouraged to examine existing communication structures and processes \nwith the corresponding government departments of each participating country. This will aim to \nidentify  major  bottlenecks,  and  to  establish  mutually  acceptable  and  clearly  identified \ncommunications channels to be used by and between senior officials, the NSs, and the CPFU \nas well as various public and private sector institutions in the participating countries. This will \ninclude  the  creation  of  direct  links  with  the  ministry  in-charge  of  ASEAN  affairs  in  each \nparticipating country. In addition, the meeting organization process will be rationalized, and the \nCPFU will receive training to help implement the new approach to meeting preparation and \nconduct. This will include developing the capacity to (i) schedule meetings bearing in mind the \ninvolvement of concerned officials in multiple national and regional activities, (ii) coordinate the \npreparation  of  documentation  and  agendas;  and  (iii) ensure  the  dissemination  of  clearly \nidentified results obtained at meetings.  \n \n14.  Enhance information dissemination. Building up the capacity of the CFPU in effective \ncommunications, media affairs, and public relations is expected to help attract partners for \nBIMP-EAGA from within and outside the region. A major part of this exercise will be to define \nthe BIMP-EAGA image for worldwide dissemination. Mechanisms will be defined for concerted \npreparation and dissemination of information on regional cooperation activities to interested \nparties  (private  sector,  governments,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  aid  agencies). \nCorresponding activities include collecting, storing, evaluating, and disseminating information, \nand providing information on the legal, trade, economic, and social environments of the EAGA \nfocus areas. Basic knowledge of BIMP-EAGA activities will be built up at the CPFU to inform \npotential stakeholders of the business environment on the different areas of the subregion \nthrough different media.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange cost of $414,000 and a local currency cost of $336,000 equivalent. ADB will finance \nthe entire foreign exchange cost and $186,000 equivalent in local currency cost on a grant basis \nfrom  the  ADB-funded  TA  program.  The  balance  of  the  local  currency  cost  of  $150,000 \nequivalent will be provided in kind by the governments of the participating countries through the \ncontribution  of  staff  time  and  use  of  government  facilities  in  undertaking  TA  activities. \nContributions by the Government of Brunei Darussalam include all direct local costs related to \nthe  implementation  of  the  TA  in  Brunei  Darussalam  excluding  the  expenses  related  to \nconsulting services, as currently Brunei Darussalam is not an ADB member. For the same \nreason,  Brunei  Darussalam  will  also  meet  the  cost  of  its  participation  in  meetings  and \nworkshops. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The CPFU will be the Executing Agency of the TA. Its exact location in the State of \nSabah,  Malaysia  will  be  communicated to ADB prior to the commencement of the TA. The TA  \n ", "    5 \nwill provide 51 person-months (30 person months of international and 21 person months of \ndomestic) consultant services in (i) institutional strengthening, (ii) project facilitation, (iii) short-\nterm  project/sector-specific  assignments,  (iv)  information  dissemination,  and  (v)  information \ntechnology services. The terms of reference for the consultants are given in Appendix 4. The \nconsultants will be fielded after the CPFU is appropriately staffed. \n \n17.  Building up the capacity of the CPFU as the coordinator of cooperation activities among \nthe participating countries will be carried out in close coordination with the NSs, which will be \nthe focal contact points of the CPFU in the participating countries.  \n \n18.   Coordination mechanisms will be defined in consultation with all concerned. Care will be \ntaken to avoid disrupting ongoing processes while improving coordination to create efficient and \nconsistent mechanisms.  \n \n19.  The training program will be determined in consultation with NSs and CPFU staff. It will \nbe conducted mostly through a hands-on approach, using learn-by-doing and direct knowledge \ntransfer methodologies. A brief secondment scheme will be organized to introduce selected staff \nof the CPFU, NSs, and EABC to the NSs, private sector focal points, and other appropriate \nagencies.  \n \n20.  A team of international and domestic consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB \nthrough  a  firm  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants  using  the \nsimplified technical proposal procedures under the quality cost-based selection system. \n \n21.  The consultant team will submit an inception report to ADB within 1 month of the start of \nservices. The inception report will (i) make an initial assessment and prepare a realistic plan to \nensure that the required TA outputs are completed on time; and (ii) make adjustments, as \nappropriate,  in  other  key  issues  affecting  the  achieving  of  the  TA  objectives.  Further,  the \nconsultant team will submit a midterm report on or about 6 months after fielding. Consultative \nmeetings  and  training  seminars  will  be  conducted  during  TA  implementation,  and  the \ncorresponding  training  materials  will  be  prepared  as  required.  The  final  TA  report  will  be \nsubmitted in December 2003. \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 12 months starting in January 2003, and is \nexpected to be substantially completed in December 2003. \n \n23.  Office space for the consultants will be provided in the premises of the CPFU by the \nSabah Government. The consultants will report to and be responsible to the chief operating \nofficer in the CPFU and the ADB TA task manager.  \n \n24.  The CPFU will be expected to serve as the focal point for information dissemination in \ncooperation with EABC. Such dissemination will be implemented in coordination with the NSs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of \n$600,000 for the purpose of Coordinating the Revival of Cooperation Activities in BIMP-EAGA, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \n \n \n \nBRUNEI DARUSSALAM-INDONESIA-MALAYSIA-PHILIPPINES EAST ASEAN1 GROWTH \nAREA (BIMP-EAGA) \n \n \n1.  The Working Groups (WGs): They represent the priority sectors of cooperation. Their \nobjectives are to (i) identify the opportunities and constraints in pursuing the objectives of the \ngrowth area, (ii) formulate a specific program of action to accelerate growth in the subregion, \nand (iii) provide direction in the identified sectors of cooperation. WGs are essentially the \noperational mechanism of the cooperation exercise and provide the flexibility to address a range \nof issues and demands. Initially, 13 WGs were created but have subsequently been reduced to \n11 as a result of the merger of some. The designated lead country for each WG functions as its \nsecretariat. WGs report to the Senior Officials Meeting. \n \n2.  The  National  Secretariats  (NSs):  Consistent  with  the  agreement  to  adopt  a \ndecentralized structure, there is no subregional central secretariat. Instead, each participating \ncountry designates a ministry or agency as that country\u2019s BIMP-EAGA NS. The NS is the focal \npoint for the exchange of information and coordination of programs related to the growth area \nand is tasked with ensuring that in-country initiatives are maintained. NSs (i) represent their \nrespective country\u2019s interests in the subregion, (ii) ensure that in-country BIMP-EAGA initiatives \nare  maintained,  (iii)  coordinate  and  monitor  BIMP-EAGA-related  in-country  projects  and \nactivities, and (iv) provide administrative support to the ministers and senior officials.  \n \n3.  The Senior Officials Meeting (SOM): It is the highest operation level of consultation \namong the participating countries. It decides on matters that need to be examined at the \nministerial meeting. Each country designates a senior official who has director level in his or her \norganization of origin. The SOM meets at prearranged dates and venues. To date, 11 SOMs \nhave been held. \n \n4.  The Ministerial Meeting: It is the highest level of consultation and decision making \namong the participating countries. Each country designates a signing minister. To date, seven \nministerial meetings have been held. \n \n5.  Private  Sector  Representation:  The  East  ASEAN  Business  Council  (EABC)  was \ncreated during the inaugural meeting, in recognition of the crucial role and participation of the \nprivate sector in accelerating the implementation of the subregion\u2019s programs and projects. Its \nfunctions are to (i) represent the private sector to EAGA governments, (ii) compile and make \navailable  economic  and  business  information  on  EAGA,  and  (iii)  promote  and  coordinate \neconomic and business interaction among the private sector within and outside of EAGA. \nSubsequently, it was given (i) the status of official private sector representative and secretariat \nin BIMP-EAGA; and (ii) in 1997, fifth-country status, allowing the private sector to have its own \ndelegation during SOMs. The implementation mechanisms provide for a parallel meeting among \nEABC, the SOM, and the ministerial meeting. A board consisting of two directors coming from \neach  member  country  governs  EABC.  It  has  a  secretariat2  that  manages  its  day-to-day \noperations and implements its programs and activities. \n                                                 \n1  Association of Southeast Asian Nations. \n2  The EABC Secretariat was launched on 19 November 1996.
