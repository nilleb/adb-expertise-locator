During the 2003 Asian Development Bank (ADB) Country Programming Mission to the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC), the Government reconfirmed its request for technical assistance \n(TA) for a Fund for Strategic Policy Conferences and Studies for Poverty Reduction. The Fact-\nFinding Mission was conducted during July and August 2003 and reached an understanding with \nthe  Government  on  the  goals,  purpose,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for consultants for the proposed TA.1  The TA framework is \nattached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since economic reforms began in 1978, the PRC has been successful in reducing the \nnumber of absolute poor in rural areas. The international community, as reflected in the Millennium \nDeclaration of the United Nations, adopted by the General Assembly in September 2000, has \nagreed  on  common  objectives  that  the  world  community  is  striving  to  achieve.  Because  of \nsustained,  rapid  economic  growth  and  targeted  Government  programs,  the  PRC  has  already \nachieved the target of halving poverty from the 1990 level. The PRC\u2019s performance has also been \ngood in addressing the nonincome dimension of poverty. By the end of 2002, the PRC was ahead \nof schedule in achieving nearly all of the Millennium Development Goals including access to primary \neducation, reduction of infant mortality, increased life expectancy, decreased infant mortality rates, \nand improved literacy rates. The three goals where more progress is needed relate to the fight \nagainst HIV/AIDS,2 provision of clean drinking water, and reduced maternal mortality. The United \nNations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  is  playing  a  leading  role  in  the  external  funding \ncommunity in monitoring progress in achieving Millennium Development Goals. \n \n3.  The PRC\u2019s success in poverty reduction reflects the impact of sustained rapid economic \ngrowth and associated improvements in the standard of living over the past two decades. The \nGovernment is committed to equitable and inclusive development, which includes mainstreaming \nthe poverty reduction efforts of a wide variety of people, programs, and funding channels and \nsignificant budget allocations for initiating self-help among the poor. The PRC\u2019s poverty reduction \napproach is area-focused, with a strong emphasis on providing social and economic infrastructure \nand creating of employment opportunities. An estimated CNY198 billion ($23.9 billion) was targeted \nto the poor from 1994 to 2000. During the same period, CNY43 billion ($5.1 billion) was targeted to \nminorities.  In  2001,  the  Government  introduced  a  new  10  year  poverty  reduction  strategy \nenvisaging investment of over CNY30 billion ($3.6 billion) a year in poor areas. \n \n4.  The poverty strategy identifies 592 key counties for poverty reduction and development to \nassist 30 million rural people with incomes under the Government\u2019s official absolute poverty line of \nCNY625  per  capita  annual  income  and  60  million  rural  people  with  incomes  under  the \nGovernment\u2019s official relative poverty line of CNY865 per capita annual income. The PRC\u2019s official \npoverty line is a rural subsistence line and is low compared to international practice. Provinces can \nalso set their own poverty lines, which can be higher than the national poverty line. Priority will be \ngiven to remote and mountainous areas, minority areas, and pockets of severe poverty. The focus \nof the new strategy is on poor household and village activities. Participatory approaches will be \nused to involve the poor. In addition, the western region development strategy, embodied in the \nTenth  Five  Year  Plan,  is  using  geographic  targeting  to  address  inadequate  infrastructure; \nenvironmental problems such as land degradation, desertification, and soil erosion; water resources \n                                                                        \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 25 August 2003. \n2   Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. ", "2 \nmanagement  issues;  weaknesses  in  the  environment  for  private  sector  operations;  and  weak \nhuman resources. In urban areas, programs are being developed to address poverty through social \nsecurity reform, income and job generation for laid-off workers, programs to combat urban pollution \n(air, water, and solid waste), and creation of off-farm employment opportunities. The PRC does not \nhave an official national urban poverty line, but cities have adopted minimum living standards to \nhelp the poor. \n \n5.  As  confirmed  at  the  2003  National  People's  Congress,  the  Government  recognizes  a \ncontinuing  need  to  address  existing  and  emerging  poverty  reduction  challenges  such  as  (i) \nmaintaining sustained rapid economic growth; (ii) ensuring that the growth is pro-poor and that the \nbenefits of growth are widely shared in society;  (iii) targeting the poor living in geographically \ndisadvantaged and environmentally degraded areas; (iv) addressing the nonincome dimensions of \npoverty such as those related to the environment; (v) addressing the need for the private sector to \nprovide alternative job opportunities to help address rising urban poverty associated with enterprise \nreform and labor retrenchment and rural migration to cities; (vi) redressing the growing inequality \nbetween the western-central and eastern regions of the country and between urban and rural areas; \n(vii) providing social safety nets to protect the most vulnerable people during economic transition;  \nand (viii) increasing the effectiveness of the poverty program through participatory approaches \ninvolving local communities. \n \n6.  To continue its successes in poverty reduction, the Government recognizes that several \nconstraints  that  need  to  be  addressed:  (i)  budget  constraints  that  limit  the  reach  of  poverty \nassistance; (ii) urban poverty and the lack of a national structure to address it; (iii) uneven coverage \nof, quality of, and access to health services for the rural poor and lack of a social security system in \nrural areas; and (iv) low enrollment of the rural poor in secondary and postsecondary schools and \nthe weak linkage of education to the demands of the market place. \n \n7.  Another concern is that the PRC\u2019s income distribution has become more unequal since the \nmid-1980s, and measures of income inequality are above the international average. Three factors \ncontributed to rising inequality: (i) the growing gap between the wealthy coastal provinces and the \npoorer interior provinces, (ii) urban incomes that have grown faster than rural incomes, and (iii) \nincreasing inequality in rural and urban populations.  \n \n8.  The Government, external funding community, non-government organizations (NGOs), and \nacademic community frequently meet to discuss poverty reduction policy and related research.  \nConferences, workshops, and seminars are convened, often at short notice, for policy discussions \nand research dissemination related to poverty reduction.  ADB is frequently invited to cosponsor \npolicy research and dissemination fora, but is usually unable to identify a new TA quickly enough to \nsponsor events held at short notice.  The proposed TA will provide a mechanism for ADB to \nrespond quickly to requests for strategic policy research that is related to poverty reduction and will \nbe used by decision makers and to respond to requests to sponsor or cosponsor strategic fora for \npolicy  discussions  and  research  dissemination.  Examples  of  conferences  that  ADB  has \ncosponsored in the past are described in para. 9. \n \n9.  Under TA for a Study on Ways to Support Rural Poverty Reduction Projects, a high-level \ninternational poverty conference, cosponsored by the Government, ADB, UDNP, and World Bank, \nwas convened in May 2000.3 The main objective of the conference was for key domestic and \ninternational organizations and experts to make recommendations to State Council Leading Group \n                                                                        \n3 ADB.1998. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for a Study on Ways to Support Rural Poverty \nReduction Projects. Manila. ", "    3     \non Poverty Alleviation and Development (LGOP) on its future poverty strategy. The conference was \nconvened by then Vice Premier  (now Premier) Wen Jiabao who also headed LGOP. Twenty-two \nvice  ministers  and  vice  minister-level  officials  representing  LGOP's  membership  attended  the \nconference. About 15 internationally and domestically renowned poverty experts also attended. \nSeveral recommendations of the conference, including some suggestions made by ADB, have been \nincorporated into LGOP's new poverty strategy. Examples include looking at poverty more broadly \nand increasing participation of civil society and villagers. \n \n10.  A high-level international conference on NGO poverty reduction policy forum was convened \nunder  the  same  TA  in  October  2001.  The  conference  was  cosponsored  by  ADB,  the  China \nFoundation  for  Poverty  Alleviation,  the  Ford  Foundation,  International  Fund  for  Agriculture \nDevelopment,  local  NGOs,  Mercy  Corps,  UNDP,  and  World  Bank.  In  a  significant  policy \ndevelopment, the Government recognized a key role for NGOs in its Ten-Year Poverty Reduction \nStrategy, approved in 2001. The Government recognizes that NGOs can play an important role in \nthe  country\u2019s  development  by  bringing  specialized  knowledge,  technical  expertise,  research \ncapacities,  local  contacts,  and  community  support  to  the  process.  NGO  participants  at  the \nconference  cited  several  factors  limiting  their  effectiveness.  These  include  a  lack  of  funding, \ninadequate training, a incomplete legal framework for NGOs, difficulties in registering international \nNGOs,  and  problems  in  recruiting  and  retaining  qualified  staff.  To  address  these  and  other \nconcerns, they advocated better information sharing to identify potential partnerships, direct funding \nfrom the Government and international agencies, and adoption of laws that give local NGOs clear \nlegal standing to raise funds, cooperate with foreign organizations, and carry out their activities.  \nThey also called for giving a greater voice to the poor, more research on the requirements of the \npoor in different regions, and greater support from international NGOs and funding agencies in skills \ntransfer and development of human resources. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The  goal  of  the  TA  is  to  increase  effectiveness,  sustainability,  and  quality  of  poverty \nreduction policies in the PRC.  The purpose is to encourage strategic policy dialogue and research \nin the area of poverty reduction and related fields (e.g., unemployment and social security) among \nthe government agencies, civil society, academies, and the funding community.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will set up a fund so that ADB can react quickly to requests to sponsor or cosponsor \npoverty-related conferences, workshops, seminars, and related studies.  Studies and meetings \nmust be related to poverty and include government agencies at national and local levels, funding \nagencies,  academia,  and  civil  society  including  the  private  sector,  NGOs,  and  poor  people. \nMeetings may be held in Beijing or in the provinces. The fund can cover costs related to preparation \nof papers for the conferences, workshops, and seminars; expert speakers; facilitators; venue; travel \n(including costs of government and NGO officials to attend domestic and overseas events); and \nother logistics.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent comprising a foreign exchange cost \nof $97,000 and a local currency cost of $403,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund and will cover the $97,000 foreign exchange cost ", "4 \nand  $303,000  equivalent  of  local  currency  cost  for  a  total  of  $400,000  equivalent.  ADB  will \nadminister  the  TA  funds.  The  Government\u2019s  in-kind  contribution  for  office  accommodation, \ntransport, remuneration of counterpart staff, and other services will amount to $100,000 equivalent. \nA detailed cost and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  LGOP will be the Executing Agency for the TA. All requests for use of the fund must be \ncoursed  through  LGOP.  Meetings  may  be  proposed  by  national  Government  agencies,  local \ngovernments, NGOs, private businesses, academia, ADB, or other funding agencies. The local \nsponsors or organizers that receive assistance through the TA for holding such meetings will be the \nimplementing agencies. LGOP and ADB (through its PRC Resident Mission) will screen all requests \naccording to agreed upon criteria and application processes. Implementing agencies may submit \nproposals to a maximum of $20,000, unless LGOP and ADB agree to waive this ceiling. An \nimplementing agency that provides honoraria to experts for a preparatory study or for conference \nfacilitation or discussion will use a competitive selection process acceptable to ADB whereby at \nleast three individuals are evaluated according to educational background and relevant poverty \nreduction experience. Funds will be disbursed by ADB through LGOP and the implementing agency \nwill liquidate expenses through LGOP to ADB. An advance payment facility will be established as \nmany conferences require funds prior to the event. \n \n15.  Implementation of the TA will begin in October 2003 and will be completed over a period of \n24 months, until October 2005. Required expert services will be determined on a case-by-case \nbasis for each activity. Indicative roles for experts are described in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to the Government of \nthe  People's  Republic  of  China  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Poverty  Reduction \nCooperation Fund, for the purpose of a Fund for Strategic Policy Conferences and Studies for \nPoverty Reduction, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
