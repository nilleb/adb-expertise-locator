INTRODUCTION  \n \n1.  The  Strategy  2020  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  identifies  private  sector \n1\ndevelopment and private sector operations as drivers of change in Asia and the Pacific.  Under \nthe Strategy 2020, ADB is expanding work with the private sector to generate greater economic \ngrowth in the region. Public\u2013private partnerships (PPP) are seen as important to achieve this \nobjective; thus, the Strategy 2020 emphasizes the promotion of PPPs in all of ADB\u2019s core \noperations.  \n \n2.  The proposed capacity development technical assistance (TA) will directly contribute to  \n \npillar 3 of ADB\u2019s Public\u2013Private Partnership Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020 by supporting ADB\u2019s \n2\ntransaction advisory services (TAS).  Following the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, ADB\u2019s \nOffice of Public\u2013Private Partnership (OPPP) was established, hosting a newly centralized TAS \n3\nfunction.  TAS provides transaction advice directly to its developing member countries (DMCs), \nincluding legal support requiring specialized legal consultants in the form of international and  \n \nlocal law firms. Concept clearance for this TA was received on 26 November 2015. The design \n4\nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n \nA.  Support for Infrastructure Development  \n \n3. ADB\u2019s DMCs across Asia and the Pacific are in need of significant infrastructure investment; \n \nhowever, several challenges exist:\n \n(i)  traditional sources of infrastructure finance are strained;  \n \n(ii)  public budgets are overstretched, with little room for additional spending \non infrastructure;  \n \n(iii)  debt markets are retreating as banks (particularly those in Europe), which used \nto play a leading role in structured finance, are still recovering from the global \nfinancial crisis and adjusting to tighter regulatory requirements, including Basel \nIII;  \n \n(iv)  multilateral development banks, including the World Bank and ADB, have limited \ncapital that is insufficient to meet the infrastructure needs of the region, estimated \nby ADB at $8 trillion from 2010 to 2020;  \n \n(v)  overseas development assistance has played a relatively modest role, having \nprovided only 2.5%\u20133.0% of total investments in infrastructure; and  \n \n(vi)  developing country capital markets lack the depth and breadth to provide the kind \nof long-term financing required for infrastructure development and investment.  \n \n \nB.  Support for Public\u2013Private Partnership Development  \n \n4.  PPP is viewed as one solution to the region\u2019s infrastructure financing needs by  \n \nsupporting public spending with private sector capital. While official flows, combined with\n \n1   \nADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. Manila.\n \n2 \nADB. 2012.

Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila.\n4  \n  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 December 2015.", " \n2\n \n \ndomestic resources, will remain vital contributors to infrastructure investment in developing \ncountries, increasing private sector finance could help fill the investment financing gap and drive \nan  expansion  in  infrastructure  investment  that  could  stimulate  growth  and  address  key \ndevelopment issues such as food insecurity, access to energy, and other key services. There is \nample private sector capital or commercial debt available to finance well-prepared projects with \na  bankable  risk  profile.  However,  during  the  cycle  of  infrastructure  projects  becoming \ninfrastructure  assets,  projects  often  show  a  gap  in  terms  of  (i)  adequacy  and  quality  of \n \ninvestment preparation, and (ii) early stage investment and development.\n \n5.  ADB supports the development of PPP capability in its DMCs by providing loans and \ntechnical support to develop internal capacity, PPP laws, institutional strength, capital markets, \nand other structures required for PPPs to be viable. ADB has also supported individual project \npreparation indirectly through TA.  \n \n6.  The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 envisions ADB becoming a more active project \ndeveloper in addition to its established role as a project financier. It also emphasizes the need to \nprovide transaction advice to DMC clients on developing bankable infrastructure projects and \nbringing private sector participation to those projects. OPPP provides TAS as a fee-based \nservice, allowing OPPP to avoid crowding out private sector advisors (which also charge fees). \nThrough TAS, ADB seeks to help DMCs deliver modernized and efficient infrastructure services. \nADB\u2019s  strategic support  promotes  and  supports  PPP  development  in  these  countries,  and \naddresses the gap between public sources of funding and infrastructure needs.  \n \n7.  Since its inception in September 2014, OPPP has undertaken significant marketing \nefforts  jointly  with  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments  and  resident  missions,  resulting  in  the \ndevelopment of a pipeline of possible PPP infrastructure transactions in Asia and the Pacific for \nwhich OPPP would be able to provide TAS. While ADB\u2019s TAS teams will bring together internal \nspecialists  with  commercial  skills  and  sector  expertise,  ADB  will  need  to  retain  external \nspecialists and consultants to support the TAS teams, particularly legal services firms with \nspecialized skills to advise on and structure PPP projects for successfully tendering these \nprojects.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n \n8.  The  TA  will  provide  specialist  legal  support  for  OPPP\u2019s  TAS  transactions.  Typical \nactivities of a legal nature that form part of TAS include (but are not limited to) legal due \ndiligence, risk allocation, transaction structuring, drafting of bid documents including instructions \nto bidders, concession agreement, and negotiating with potential bidders on transaction terms. \nThe outputs will focus on information needed by the DMC client to develop bankable PPP \nprojects. Based on the initial size and term of the TA and the costs of hiring from a limited pool \nof  international  law  firms  with  highly  specialized  experience  in  project  finance  and  PPP, \nincluding in the developing markets, it is expected that the TA can support two to three TAS \ntransactions. In most cases, ADB will require the support of a reputable international law firm \nsuitably partnered with a local law firm.  \n \n9.  ADB expects that in entering into a TAS mandate with its DMC clients, ADB will be \nappointed the lead or co-lead mandated advisor for the specific PPP project. In turn, ADB will \nengage law firms on a project-by-project basis. The TAS mandate will require that the collective \nmandated advisory team owes an exclusive duty of care to the DMC client in ensuring that a \nbankable transaction is prepared. Each law firm, however, will provide its outputs directly to \nADB in its capacity as the mandated advisor, and thus, will owe its exclusive duty of care to  ", " \n3\n \n \nADB. While law firms will deliver outputs and owe a duty of care to ADB, their support will be \n \nprovided for the ultimate benefit of the DMC client.\n \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n10.  The impact will be increased delivery of infrastructure for poorly serviced populations in \nDMCs. Successful PPP transactions that are supported by the TA will demonstrate ADB\u2019s TAS \ncapability and provide model cases for future projects.  \n \n11.  The outcome will be an increase in the number of awarded PPP transactions, which will \nbe assessed by the completion of contract negotiations and DMC client acknowledgement of a \nsigned concession agreement for projects that have TAS mandates.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n12. The TA will provide legal support for OPPP\u2019s TAS operations. The outputs of the TA will be \n(i) legal and other transaction supports provided as required by TAS mandates and (ii) model \nPPP concession agreements and other relevant agreements developed. By delivering these \noutputs, DMCs will have project agreements, which can serve as templates for future projects \n \nand case studies on how to achieve international best practice.\n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n13. The TA is estimated to cost $1,300,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-others). The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix  2.  It  is  expected  that  the  TA  will  be  expanded  with  additional  financing  from \ndevelopment partners, based on the growth of OPPP\u2019s TAS business. ADB will discuss with \neach DMC client whether to reimburse ADB for costs incurred under the TA, if reimbursement \nby the DMC client is legally and administratively permissible under applicable law and permitted \nunder the applicable TA framework agreement between ADB and the DMC. If the DMC client \nagrees to reimburse ADB for its costs under the TA, ADB and the DMC will enter into a separate \nmemorandum  of  understanding  that  will  document  the  terms  of  the  reimbursement \narrangements, including the amount and timing of payments, the terms and conditions of the \nrelevant TA framework agreement, and the TA letter between ADB and the DMC client. If there \nis no reimbursement arrangement, ADB will not recover costs incurred as part of fees payable \nunder the terms of the TAS mandate, but ADB may seek reimbursement, if permitted under \napplicable law, from private sector participants under the terms of the relevant concession \n \nagreement.\n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n1.  Engagement of Consultants  \n \n14.  ADB expects to engage international and national legal expertise for TAS mandates \nsecured by OPPP. ADB\u2019s recruitment of the law firms will comply with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).  \n \n15.  Given the highly specialized nature of the legal services ADB generally will require for \nPPP transactions, ADB expects to prequalify a panel of suitable international law firms through \nIDC. Such IDC will need to be set up in close consultation between OGC and OPPP. Typically, \nthe call down IDC assignment will be awarded on a competitive basis using either quality- and  ", " \n4\n \n \ncost-based selection (90:10) or fixed budget selection. The expertise of the law firm may also be \ndrawn  on  a  single-source  selection  basis  where  unique  qualifications  and/or  a  natural \ncontinuation of previous work carried out by the firm will warrant such engagement, subject to \n \napproval of ADB's Operations Services and Financial Management Department.\n \n \n16. The value and the duration of each assignment for the law firm or firms will depend on the \nnature of the underlying TAS mandate secured by ADB. Costs would be difficult to estimate \nwithout the context of the actual PPP project. However, based on OPPP\u2019s and OGC\u2019s most \nrecent experience under existing TAS mandates, it is envisaged that the TA will cover two to \nthree PPP projects. OPPP is currently seeking further TAS mandates, including (among others) \nin the power and transport sectors in Southeast Asia, the transport sector in East Asia, and the \nhealthcare sector in Central and West Asia. If OPPP successfully receives any one or more of \nthose or any other future TAS mandates, the TA would support the legal costs associated with \n \nthose mandates.\n \n2.  Other Matters  \n \n17.  Executing and implementing agencies. Services provided to DMC governments under \nthis TA will be subordinate to and delivered through an ADB TAS mandate. OPPP will be the \nexecuting agency and implementing agency. As part of every TAS mandate entered into by \nOPPP, it will seek the assistance of the DMC agencies managing the PPP process. Within ADB, \nOPPP  will  work  closely  with  regional  departments  to  benefit  from  sector  expertise  and \ncoordinate  with  various  DMC  agencies.  OPPP  will  coordinate  with  relevant  regional \ndepartments and resident missions, as they have sector expertise, country knowledge and \nrelationships, and a local presence. OPPP will also work and coordinate with OGC to identify \nand recruit an international law firm for a particular PPP project for which legal support is \nrequired by ADB\u2019s TAS team. OPPP and OGC will supervise and monitor the legal consultants \nto ensure the adequacy of each law firm\u2019s outputs.  \n \n18.  Recipient  government  inputs.  Recipient  governments  are  expected  to  provide \ncounterpart staff, office space, and other support, as articulated in the TAS mandate between \nADB and the relevant government agency. Prior to entering into a TAS mandate, ADB will \nconsult with the government counterpart about the use of this TA and other forms of support, as \nwell as the form and quantity of counterpart funding that may be required.  \n \n19.  Monitoring and evaluation. The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the \nimplementation of activities and satisfactory delivery of outputs following the agreed time line \nand  budget  allocation.  To  support  monitoring  and  evaluation  (and  when  commercially \npracticable), consultants will submit an inception report, quarterly progress notes, a midterm \nreport, a draft final report, and a final report to ADB. Because the provision of TAS will require \nOPPP to have frequent interactions with consultants hired under this TA, there will be regular \nmonitoring  of  overall  TA  progress,  assessment  of  performance,  and  confirmation  of  the \nrelevance of the TA. Any knowledge products created by the TA will be provided to the DMC  \n \nclient and to ADB for dissemination to the government and other stakeholders as appropriate, \n5\nwhile respecting project confidentiality restrictions.   \n \n \n \n5 Through  TAS,  OPPP  is  providing  a  service  to  ADB\u2019s  DMCs.  Thus,  TAS  mandates  will  typically  have  a \nconfidentiality clause that may restrict OPPP\u2019s ability to share information provided by a DMC client to OPPP with \n \ncertain third parties or even inside ADB. ", " \n5\n \n \n20.  Timing. The TA will be implemented from 31 March 2016 to 31 March 2019 on an as-\nneeded basis. Closing of the TA is anticipated by 31 September 2019. Further specifics on the \nTA scope will be determined when TAS mandates, which require this TA are awarded to OPPP.  \n \n21.  TA  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n   \nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n \n22.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,300,000 on a grant basis \nfor Enhancing Public\u2013Private Partnership Project Development through Legal Support for ADB \nTransaction Advisory Services in Asia and the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the \n \nBoard.", "6  Appendix 1  \n \n \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK\n \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned With\n \n \nIncreased delivery of infrastructure for poorly serviced populations in DMCs (Project defined)\n \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and   \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks   \nOutcome         \nAwarded PPP  Concession agreement for  DMC client  Government reduces   \ntransactions  up to two transactions by  acknowledgement of  support for PPPs   \nincreased  June 2019 (Baseline 2016:  signed concession     \n     0)   agreement  Psloolwitisc adle ucniscioenrt aminatkying     \n      or completion of   \n      transactions   \n         \nOutputs         \n1.

Technical  advisory  services  mandates  will  typically  require  the  services  of  an \ninternational law firm and a local law firm. Both will have similar terms of reference, though tasks \nwill be divided based on international matters versus local matters.  \n \n2.  Legal advisor (48 person-months). The legal advisor will be a law firm with substantial \nexperience in public\u2013private partnership transaction advisory in both developed and developing \nmarkets, including preparing and negotiating all project agreements to a high standard, as well \nas drafting concession agreements in multiple sectors and international project finance. The \nlegal  advisor  must  have  previous  experience  in  the  drafting  of  sector-specific  concession \nagreements and other related project agreements, including in markets where no precedent for \nsuch documentation exists. The legal advisor can include international and/or local counsel as \nrequired by the transaction, and is likely to include three individuals (partner, senior associate, \nand associate) per transaction. Working under the overall guidance of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) as the mandated advisor, the responsibilities of the legal advisor will include the \nfollowing:  \n \n(i)  conduct legal due diligence on the project for the benefit of the government \nand/or ADB;  \n \n(ii)  advise and assist the government and ADB in addressing all legal matters that \narise  during  the  structuring  of  the  public\u2013private  partnership  transaction, \nprebidding and bidding processes, and negotiations with the bidders;  \n \n(iii)  assist the government and ADB in proposing contractual drafts of the project \nagreements to reflect the final negotiated and agreed position;  \n  (iv)  provide support, as necessary, for the negotiation process;  \n(v)  assist the team coordinator in submitting technical assistance reports;  \n \n(vi)  attend to all other matters of a legal nature relating to the transaction for which \nADB is the mandated advisor; and  \n \n(vii)  provision of other transaction support services as required, such as translation, \ndata room management, advertising and promotion of transactions, and other \nforms of support.
