The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  China  (PRC),  through  the  National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission (NDRC), has requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) for support to prepare the proposed Strengthening Health Security Project. The proposed \ntransaction technical assistance (TA) and the ensuing loan are ADB\u2019s response to addressing the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.  \n \n2.   Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) continue to be a significant public health concern \nand  cause  of  considerable  socioeconomic  disruption  in the  PRC. Most  of  these  EIDs  are \nzoonoses\u2014diseases  that  originate  from  animals.  Approximately  60%  of  all  known  human \ninfectious diseases in the world and about 75% of EIDs affecting people are zoonotic.1 EIDs are \nparticularly important because of its complex and uncertain nature with an impact that transcends \nthe health sector. The experiences highlighted by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) \nin 2003 and the COVID-19, both of which are EIDs, demonstrate immediate consequences on \nhealth, travel restrictions, social distancing, stringent community quarantine measures, among \nothers. The tremendous effect is equally magnified in the economy, with the slowing down of trade \nand supply chains, businesses, travel, consumer spending, and overall economic activity. COVID-\n19 is expected to have serious impact on poverty and welfare, through illness, death, and lost \nincomes.2 Economic forecast notes that continued COVID-19 outbreak would cost the PRC as \nmuch as $692 billion in economic losses.3     \n \n3.  The unprecedented impact of COVID-19 outbreak has led to the PRC\u2019s renewed interest \non the development of focused preparedness and response programs for longer-term health \nsecurity. The regional and global public goods nature of health, prevention, and control of EIDs is \nclear, and fundamentally an issue of international security and economic development. Preventing \nfuture outbreaks in EID hotspots such as the PRC is an important investment. Additionally, the \nPRC is at a crucial development phase, and the government requires international support and \ncooperation to balance development and address challenges posed by future outbreaks. The \nproject will support the PRC in the development of an integrated system to strengthen the health \nsecurity of the country. The project comprises upgrading of public health emergency facilities; \ndevelopment of modernized disease prevention, policies, research, and control systems; and \nimprovement of talent building and international exchange capabilities. \n \n4.  Output 1: Public health emergency facilities upgraded. The project will address gaps \nin core capacities in health systems to withstand huge demand for critical care as well as maintain \nessential health services in times of epidemics and other public health emergencies. The project \nwill facilitate the (i) development of national standards for the renovation and refurbishment work \nfor health facilities, (ii) site inspection of select public health facilities directly targeted under the \nproject, (iii) actual renovation work in targeted public health facilities, and (iv) procurement of \nmedical and laboratory equipment and diagnostics supplies.  The project will (i) strengthen \ninfection prevention and control capacities in health care settings; (ii) improve referral system to \nmobilize all levels of health care during epidemics; and (iii) pilot innovative technology solutions \nto facilitate disease prevention, detection, and response.   \n \n \n1  K.E.

The project will strengthen institutional capacity for disease prevention and control \nsystems to ensure strategies and resources needed are in place to address infectious disease \noutbreaks and other public health emergencies. The project will focus on the advancement of \npolicies, standards, and guidelines; development of comprehensive prevention, control, and \nresponse  plans;  provision  of  equipment;  development  of  governance  and  coordination \nmechanisms with other sectors; and collaborative research and knowledge sharing. The project \nwill (i) enhance preparedness plans including continuity of essential services, risk communication \nand community engagement, and emergency response including surge staff deployment and \nprocurement of essential supplies; (ii) build disease surveillance and response system to quickly \nidentify EID networks and facilitate arrangements with international reference laboratories, and \ndevelop standard operating procedures; (iii) develop a national interoperable electronic reporting \nsystem to facilitate timely reporting and quick response; (iv) establish collaboration mechanism \nwith relevant stakeholders including non-health ministries, specialized agencies, private sector \norganizations, and civil society; (v) establish collaborative research programs with academics and \nspecialized  agencies,  and  undertake  research on  key topics;  and  (vi)  enhance  knowledge \nmanagement and use of existing knowledge platforms to share scientific researches and good \npractices. The project will explore system elements that have important functions in the wider \nhealth sector, such as equitable access to health care services and long-term health needs of key \npopulation groups that can be considered for future investments. \n \n6.  Output 3: Training excellence and international cooperation capability enhanced. \nThe project will support the development of (i) capacity building training for public health staff \nincluding certificate courses on key topics (e.g., One Health approach,4 disease modeling, \ncomplex  data  analysis,  analytical  techniques  to  locate  areas  at  highest  risk,  outbreak \npreparedness  and management,  laboratory  diagnosis  of  EIDs,  and  laboratory  and  medical \nlogistics  management);  and  (ii)  international  exchange  programs.  The  project  will  facilitate \npartnership with academe and specialized agencies in strengthening public health professional \neducation and setting quality standards. The project will establish a regional cooperation platform \nto host regular technical forums and continuing education and this can be linked with existing \nregional platforms such as the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program and \nGreater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program. \n \n7.  Strategic fit. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s strategic operational priority on addressing \nremaining poverty and reducing inequalities, in particular the recognition of Asian economies \nvulnerabilities to health security threats.5 The project is consistent with the Greater Mekong \nSubregion health cooperation, which include Yunnan Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous \nRegion, PRC, committing to multisector cooperation through One Health approach.6 \n \n8.  ADB value added. ADB has been working with the PRC since 1986, with a rich history of \ndevelopment finance and knowledge sharing. ADB is committed to working with the PRC in \naddressing development challenges and implementing national priorities and support the PRC in \nareas where it can add most value. The project is an opportunity to demonstrate an approach to \nstrengthen capacity of the country to effectively respond to emerging diseases, improve health, \nand facilitate economic development. ADB can specifically contribute to the progressive adoption \nof broader policy agenda on health security, initiate innovative and appropriate solutions to tackle \n \n4  The World Health Organization defines One Health approach to designing and implementing programs, policies, and \nresearch in which multiple sectors work together to achieve better public health outcomes. One Health is particularly \nrelevant to the control of diseases that can spread between animals and humans. \n5  ADB.

The project will result in the following outcome: management of epidemics of infectious \ndiseases and other health hazards improved. The project will be aligned with the following \nimpacts: capacity for early warning, risk reduction, and management of national health risks \nstrengthened;8 and prevention and control of major communicable diseases strengthened.9 The \nmodality is a regular loan of $300 million to be financed from ADB's ordinary capital resources.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n10.  The NDRC, the executing agency, has limited experience with ADB requirements in the \ndevelopment and processing of projects on health.
