During  the  2004  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC)  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  help the  Guiyang \nMunicipal Government (GMG) prepare a project for possible ADB financing. The technical \n1\nassistance (TA) is included in the PRC country strategy and program for 2005.  In December \n2004  a  fact-finding  mission  visited  the  PRC  to  hold  discussions  with  GMG  staff,  and  an \nunderstanding was reached with the PRC Government on the detailed objectives, scope, costs, \nimplementation, and financing arrangements for the TA to prepare the Guiyang Integrated \nWater Resource Management Project. The Project will support GMG in utilizing scarce water \nresources by improving conservation, management, and development of water resources in \n2\nGuiyang Municipality.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3\n2.  Located in the central region of Guizhou Province,  Guiyang Municipality is divided \nadministratively into three counties (Kaiyang, Xifeng, and Xiuwen); one suburb city (Qingzheng); \nand Guiyang City, which comprises four rural districts and two urban districts, and accounts for \n5% of the municipality\u2019s total area. Of the municipality\u2019s 3.5 million population, about 1.5 million \n(43%) live in the urban districts of Guiyang, the remaining 2 million (57%) are scattered across \nthe surrounding rural area. About 25% of the rural population lives below the poverty line \n(CNY1,200 per capita per year).  \n \n3.  Both urban and rural areas of the municipality are on the mountainous top ridge of the \nwatershed boundary between the Changjiang River (Yangtze) Basin to the north and the Pearl \nRiver Basin to the south. Annual average precipitation is 1,117 millimeters. About 95% of the \narea drains into the Changjiang River Basin. Total renewable freshwater supply is estimated at \n9.0 billion cubic meters (m3), or 1.2 m3 per capita; almost half evaporates due to the poor \nvegetation and rocky terrain of the catchment areas. The remaining water drains into rivers (4.3 \nbillion m3 or 48% of total precipitation) as quick surface flows through numerous short creeks \nand streams that run deep in valleys, or through fast-flowing deep aquifers (groundwater rivers) \nthrough the limestone layer (karst areas).  \n \n4.  Guiyang urban districts play an important role as an economic engine of growth for the \nprovince. More than 10 new industries are planning to move to Guiyang City by 2010; industry \nemployees and their dependents are expected to increase the urban population by more than \n150,000. Already, the rapidly increasing urban population has seriously stretched the existing \nwater supply capacity, resulting in reduced water pressure and rotational water supply in dry \nyears. Based on the projected growth of the urban population, Guiyang Municipality forecasts its \nwater supply capacity must be increased by 530,000 m3/day by 2010, and by a further 880,000 \nm3/day by 2020.  \n \n                                                 \n1\n  The allocated funding was increased during the review for the country strategy and program update (December 2004). \n2\n  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 13 October 2004. \n3  Guizhou Province, with a total area of 176,167 square kilometers (1.8 % of the country), is mountainous, has no \nplains, and is rich in natural resources (certain minerals, hydro energy potential, biodiversity, and potential for tourism). \nThe population in 2003 was 38.7 million (3% of the country). The 16 ethnic minority groups constitute about 35% of \nthe provincial population with the Miao being the most populous (around 11% of the population). The rural population \nof Guizhou (85% of total) has the lowest annual urban income per capita among the provinces, and the second lowest \nrural income (CNY1,490 per capita per year), after Tibet. ", "2   \n5.  In the surrounding rural area, shortage of water\u2014both for drinking and irrigation\u2014is a \ncritical constraint to (i) improving rural incomes and living standards, and (ii) reducing persisting \npoverty. Due to the steep mountainous terrain, neither river water nor groundwater is available \nto many farmers, particularly those who cultivate crops in hilly, upper catchment areas. Only \n4\nabout 10% of the municipality area is arable; less than half is irrigated.  Seasonal and annual \nvariation in water availability is extreme; more than 70% of the rain falls from May to August. \nLargely because of drought conditions, food security is always at risk. Farmers cannot diversify \ntheir crops, even though the mild temperate weather permits farming year-round. The water \nconstraints for household use and irrigation result in subsistence farmers being trapped in \npoverty; this situation could worsen as the demand from other water users increases.  \n \n5\n6.  In large villages, village committees administer rural water supply,  while urban residents \nrely on local water supply companies for their piped water supply. The majority of the rural \npopulation in smaller villages is not usually connected to a common public water supply system, \nand must depend on local springs and streams. Some villagers have small storage tanks close \nto their houses for domestic, livestock, and agricultural use. Currently, around 466,000 rural \nresidents, or 23% of the municipality\u2019s rural population, are not able to satisfy their water needs, \nincluding 137,000 who do not have access to safe drinking water. By far the largest proportion \nof rural water is needed for agricultural purposes (domestic requirements account for only \naround 10%). Yet irrigation facilities are old and the efficiency of irrigation infrastructure is low, \nleading to waste of precious water, as well as soil erosion. Only around 25\u201330% of the total \ncropland is effectively irrigated. \n \n7.  Given the abundant supply of renewable freshwater and the numerous creeks and \nstreams that run deep in valleys, Guiyang Municipality has strong potential for developing water \nresources by constructing reservoirs. Preliminary investigations identified potential dam sites \nwithin the municipality for the storage of over 4 billion m3; this compares with the existing \nreservoir storage of 2.44 billion m3, excluding hydropower reservoirs.6 The creation of new \nreservoirs would support sustained economic and social development in urban areas, but also \nreduce poverty and improve incomes in large rural areas. Preliminary estimates indicate that \nimproving irrigation water supply would (i) increase crop yields (by 30% for rice, 20\u201330% for \nmaize, and 10\u201315% for wheat and oilseed), and (ii) contribute to crop diversification. Such \nproduction increases in drought-prone areas would help to significantly reduce periodic food \ndeficits (and starvation), and subsequently reduce poverty of the rural poor. \n \n8.  In parallel with augmenting water supply, measures to improve water management need \nto  be  encouraged.  Farming  techniques  to  conserve  water  and  soil  need  to  be  widely \ndisseminated and practiced by farmers. Municipal industries in general are encouraged to reuse \nprocessed water. Consumers need to understand urban water saving measures, especially the \nimportance of economic water resources management during water scarcity. Water saving by \ncommunities  and  industry  may  be  encouraged  by  direct  targeted  group  campaigns,  and \nexhibitions and fairs where water-saving appliances are demonstrated and made available for \npurchase. Pilot programs to conserve water and control soil erosion in farming on slope fields\u2014\nincluding improved on-farm water management\u2014must be promoted and replicated. Because \nmany rural water infrastructure facilities are dilapidated and need rehabilitation, a proper and \n                                                 \n4\n  Per capita irrigated area is estimated at 0.03 ha which is only half of the country\u2019s average. \n5\n  The municipality has 71 townships and villages. \n6\n The Guiyang Water Source Development and Use Investigation and Analysis Report (1999), and the Provincial \n  Comprehensive Water Resources Master Plan.  ", "  3\nsustainable operation and maintenance mechanism needs to be developed and implemented.  \n \n9.  Economic  water  pricing  is  an  effective  measure  to  encourage  conservative  water \nconsumption, but has not been directly used as an incentive to reduce water consumption. In \nGuiyang urban area, the water fee is based on an increasing block tariff, in line with the 2003 \nnational  guidelines.  The  tariff  includes  the  water  supply  direct  costs,  fees,  taxes,  and  a \nreasonable water tariff profit. In rural areas, irrigation water is priced according to the area \nirrigated. The fee is collected by the local water management stations. A resource extraction fee \nof CNY0.02 per m3 is charged for extraction from water sources. These pricing schemes are \nnominal and based on cost recovery, rather than serving as a management tool for effective \nconservation and savings of water or efficient resource allocation in conditions of water scarcity. \nGMG is now considering increasing the water resource extraction fee, but needs assistance to \nincorporate economic pricing principles for efficient utilization, conservation, and allocation of \nwater resources. \n \n10.  The Water Resources Bureau (WRB) of Guiyang Municipality is in charge of all aspects \nof water resources management within the municipality (i.e., development and monitoring of \nwater resources; collection, storage, and conveyance of water; protection of water sources; and \nsoil erosion prevention measures in the catchments). Integrated water resources management \n(IWRM)  is  new  to  WRB.  To  effectively  manage  increasing  conflicts  from  multiple  users\u2019 \ndemands  for  water,  WRB  needs  to  rapidly  develop  an  appropriate  institutional  and  legal \nframework, as well as strengthen its capacity. The project proposal is in line with the overall \nplanning objectives of Guiyang Municipality and Guizhou Province. Background documents for \nthe project proposal are largely based on the Guiyang Water Source Development and Use \nInvestigation and Analysis Report (1999), and the Provincial Comprehensive Water Resources \nMaster Plan. Integrated management and planning requires a coherent direction of quantity \ndevelopment as well as resource management, including institutional, legal, and total watershed \napproaches. Acknowledging the importance of integrated water management, GMG wishes to \nestablish IWRM in line with advanced international thinking and ADB\u2019s water policy.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The  Project  is  to  ensure  establishment  of  a  long-term  comprehensive  water  sector \ndevelopment plan that can be implemented within GMG\u2019s capabilities and the policy framework \nfor  the  sector.  The  TA  will  help  GMG  develop  an  investment  proposal  to  contribute  to \ndevelopment of the water sector within the context of a long-term, comprehensive plan to \nestablish an IWRM system. The main TA output will be an investment proposal suitable for ADB \nfinancing,  comprising  (i)  an  outline  long-term  water  sector  investment  plan  for  GMG,  for \ndevelopment  during  project  implementation;  (ii)  an  assessment  of  institutional  capacity  to \nimplement  the  investment  plan;  (iii)  a  training  plan  to  strengthen  institutional  capacity;  (iv) \ncriteria for the selection and appraisal of subprojects to undergo feasibility studies during project \nimplementation; and (v) a set of practical and operational guidelines for a range of participatory \nsoil and water conservation measures and water-saving practices, including an assessment of \nthe potential for using economic pricing as an allocation tool. The TA will critically assess local \nsystems for determining the technical, environmental, financial, economic, and social feasibility \nof the investment plan; and suggest improvements to contribute to GMG\u2019s overall development \ngoals  in  relation  to  its  long-term  development  plans  for  the  water  sector.  A  design  and \nmonitoring framework for the TA is attached (Appendix 1). ", "4   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The Project will be prepared in accordance with ADB guidelines for sector lending. The \ncriteria include (i) the borrowing entity has a sector development plan to meet the priority \ndevelopment needs of the sector; (ii) the borrowing entity has the institutional capacity to \nimplement the sector development plan; and (iii) if so required, the policies applicable to the \nsector  can  be  improved.  According  to  ADB  operational  procedures  for  sector  lending \nassistance, the borrowing entity must submit: (i) an acceptable sector development plan; (ii) a \nstatement on sector policies that affect development of the sector; and (iii) an assessment of the \ntechnical  and  managerial  capabilities  of  the  sector  institutions  to  develop,  process,  and \nimplement subprojects. \n \n \n13.  The TA will assist GMG to complete the requirements for sector loan assistance and will \nbe conducted in two phases separated by a break of approximately 1 month to enable the \nGovernment and ADB to thoroughly consider the recommendations, in particular the proposed \nstrategy for future development of the water sector. Phase 1 entails the development of the \nstrategy and a comprehensive assessment of the policy and institutional framework within which \nmedium- and long-term investment planning can be conducted. The strategy will be prepared \nunder GMG direction and supervision. GMG will be responsible for obtaining approval of the \nplan, and for ensuring broad participation by representatives of all of the main stakeholders. \n \n14.  Phase 2 will focus on the requirements for implementing the investment program and \nestablishing an IWRM system. It will include appraisal of subprojects to serve as models for \nprocessing  of  subprojects  during  project  implementation  and  beyond,  and  design  of  the \ncapacity-building component. The Project will be designed and set within the context of the \nlong-term development plan for the water sector in Guiyang Municipality\u2014an outline of the plan \nis an expected output of phase 2. \n \n15.  The TA will address the following: (i) comprehensive analysis of water resources, policy \nand institutional frameworks, and coordination and management systems to establish a sound \nbasis for comprehensive water resources sector planning; (ii) project design and preparation \nappropriate for ADB interventions in line with ADB guidelines for assessing environmental \nimpact, poverty reduction, social impact, involuntary resettlement, and impact on indigenous \npeoples; and (iii) critical assessment and design of economic pricing of water, public awareness, \nand participatory water conservation plans.  \n \n16.  The TA will help GMG institute a planning process with a people-centered as well as \npro-poor focus. Throughout TA implementation, various village, township, county, and municipal \nconsultations  and  workshops  will  be  conducted  to  ensure  stakeholder  participation.  A \npartnership approach will utilize the respective strengths and resources of the public sector \n(municipal  and  county  agencies),  the  private  sector  (nongovernment  organizations, \nentrepreneurs,  and  private  sector  associations),  and  farmers  (in  groups,  associations,  or \ncooperatives). A systems learning approach will be used to (i) ensure a thorough understanding \nof the economic and social systems in Guiyang Municipality; and (ii) provide flexibility, and \nengender commitment and a sense of stakeholder ownership in the Project. Lessons learned \nfrom relevant previous and ongoing projects will be incorporated into the project design. An \ninitial poverty and social analysis is shown in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,210,000 equivalent, comprising $611,000 \nof foreign exchange cost and $599,000 equivalent of local currency cost. ADB will provide \n$960,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $349,000 equivalent of local \ncosts. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program ($800,000) and \nthe Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector ($160,000). The Government will provide $250,000 \nequivalent to cover in-kind counterpart costs and services, including provision of necessary \ndata, counterpart staff, office facilities, and administrative support (equivalent to about 20% of \nthe total TA cost). The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB  to  finance  any  ensuing  project.  The  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  is  shown  in \nAppendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n7\n18.  WRB, the Executing Agency for the TA, will establish a TA management unit.  The vice \nmayor, who is in charge of WRB, will chair the leading group. The TA management unit will \nfacilitate  interdepartmental  arrangements  and  coordination  of  ADB,  TA  consultants,  the \nconcerned offices of GMG, and provincial and central governments as necessary. A full-time \nqualified  and  experienced  senior  staff  will  be  appointed  as  the  TA  manager  to  foster  TA \nimplementation. Two full-time counterpart staff with relevant qualifications and experience will \nbe assigned to facilitate the work of the consultants. To facilitate TA implementation, GMG will \nprovide support to the consultants, including a suitably furnished office with utilities and Internet \naccess,  local  transport  for  field  visits,  materials,  maps,  data,  documents,  and  coordination \nrequired for the TA activities.  \n \n19.  The TA will be carried out over 8 months, commencing in August 2005 and completed \nby  May  2006.  A  total  of  58  person-months  of  consulting  services  will  be  required:  20 \ninternational and 38 domestic. Terms of reference for the consulting services are given in \nAppendix 4. An international consulting firm will be engaged according to ADB Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging \ndomestic consultants. ADB will engage a firm of consultants, the selection of which will follow \nADB quality and cost-based selection method, following full technical proposal procedures. \nEquipment for the TA will be procured by the consultants in accordance with ADB Guidelines for \nProcurement.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $160,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector, and (ii) ADB providing \nthe balance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of \nthe  People's  Republic  of  China  for  preparing  the  Guiyang  Integrated  Water  Resources \nManagement Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n7\n  The physical office will be established on the premises of the local design institute where domestic feasibility studies \nwill be undertaken.
