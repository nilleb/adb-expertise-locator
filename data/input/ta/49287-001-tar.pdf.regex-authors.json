INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This capacity development technical assistance (TA) is designed to strengthen the legal \nand  institutional  framework  for  commerce  and  private  sector  investment  by  (i)  providing \nassistance for the drafting, advocacy, and finalization of updated and modernized commercial \nlaws;  and  (ii)  supporting  a  capacity-building  training  program  to  improve  the  skills  and \nknowledge of legal practitioners in various areas of commercial and financial law. This will \nimprove  the  investment  environment  and  facilitate  increased  levels  of  investment  and \ncommercial  activities  in  Myanmar\u2019s  private  sector.  A  fact-finding  mission  was  fielded  in \nSeptember  2015,  during  which  the government  agreed  on  the  proposed  impact,  outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for \nconsultants. \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) interim country partnership \nstrategy, 2015\u20132016 for Myanmar (which was extended from ADB\u2019s interim country partnership \nstrategy,  2012\u20132014)  to  strengthen  the  policy,  legislative,  and  regulatory  environment  for \ninvestment and trade and to support human resource development in both the public and \nprivate sectors.1 This TA falls under private sector development, which is one of the key drivers \nof change under ADB\u2019s Strategy 20202 and was identified as a strategic priority under the \nmidterm review.3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The government has set out a reform agenda to increase economic growth. Part of the \nagenda includes improving the investment climate through a comprehensive reform of corporate \nand financial laws. New foreign investment laws have been enacted, and a new company law \n(to modernize the 1914 Companies Act) is expected to be submitted to Parliament for approval.5 \nTo  achieve  the  timeline  required  by  the  government,  the  new  company  law  focuses  on \nfundamental  areas,  including  incorporation,  management,  and  administration.  The  TA  will \nfurther assist in updating and modernizing Myanmar\u2019s commercial, financial investment, and \neconomic legislation (such as the insolvency law), as may be agreed with the government, to \nalign with international best practice6. It will assist in the creation of an improved investment \nenvironment and competitive private and corporate sectors, and with further legislation needed \nfor corporate governance measures aligned with current international practice. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2015.

Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 October 2015. \n5  Under ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for Strengthening Institutions for \na Better Investment Climate. Manila (TA 8651-MYA, financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction), ADB has \nbeen supporting the development of a new company law. This TA will follow on from previous work on the new \ncompany law, and support the drafting of further legislation left largely untouched in the new company law, such as \non insolvency. The TA will be implemented in close coordination with ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department. In \naddition, the TA will complement and reinforce the objectives of other ADB TA projects which seek to improve the \ninvestment climate for commercial activities, including ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Mekong Business \nInitiative. Manila (TA 8785-REG), under which a private sector development framework for Myanmar is being \ndeveloped. \n6  A functioning insolvency law is an essential component of a market economy. Insolvency laws provide for the \norderly administration of an insolvent company, the various and conflicting claims of different creditors, and the \npriorities of those claims in the context of restructuring or liquidation. Such a law requires adequate legislation \nsupported by capacity to implement within the judiciary and among the legal profession. \n ", "2 \n \n4.  Quality  legal  education  is  an  essential  requirement  for  producing  competent  legal \nprofessionals who can advise investors and investees on the terms and consequences of their \ninvestment, counsel on legal risks, and contribute to the rule of law and fair administration of \njustice. However, legal education in Myanmar was, and to a certain extent continues to be, \nundermined by, among other factors, low admissions standards, poor curriculum, and poor \nmethods of instruction. This has resulted in graduates being considered to be ill-prepared to \npractice law or to provide investors with essential legal analysis and advice on legal risks. In \n1988, universities were closed because of student demonstrations, and it was not until 1993 that \nthe University of Yangon was reopened. The longest period of closure of the universities was \nfrom 1988 to 2000, when the universities were open only for the equivalent of 3 years.7 This \nperiod of closure and disruption to formal higher legal education has reinforced the teaching of \nlaw  through  distance  education  or  university  correspondence  courses,  offering  a  truncated \ncurriculum and assessment. For law graduates of universities and distance education courses, \nthere is a presumed need for considerable self-education upon completion of this formal legal \neducation as the education acquired in law school is not perceived to be adequate to practice \nlaw upon completion of studies.8 Overcoming these challenges will require deliberate efforts to \nbuild the legal profession in Myanmar and bring its operation into compliance with international \nstandards. \n \n5.  Legal practitioners play a crucial role in facilitating private investments and commercial \nactivities. In the context of Myanmar, which is experiencing an influx of foreign direct investment, \ngood legal and structuring advice is necessary to create an enabling environment for private \ninvestment. Credible and informed legal advice in the following areas, in particular, serves to \nimprove business confidence and attract investment: preparation and negotiation of commercial \nand financial contracts, company law, formation of companies and joint ventures, corporate \ngovernance,  insolvency  law,  international  financing  transactions,  international  commercial \narbitration, and environmental law. By improving the legal foundations for the business climate, \nthis TA will facilitate growth of domestic investment, small and medium-sized enterprises, and \nforeign direct investment. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The impact will be an improved enabling environment for commerce and investment. \nThe  outcome  will  be  a  strengthened  legal  and  institutional  framework  for  commerce  and \ninvestment. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Commercial and financial laws updated and modernized to align with \ninternational best practice. The Supreme Court of the Union (SCU) is the designated body \nresponsible  for  the  insolvency  law.  During  the  fact-finding  mission,  the  SCU  specifically \nidentified the insolvency law as a priority for updating and modernization, and requested ADB \nsupport to update the law. Accordingly, under the TA, an updated and modernized insolvency \nlaw will be prepared and, to assist in the passage of law, public consultations, advocacy, and \npublic  education  on  the  law  and  its  implementation  will  be  carried  out.  New  ancillary  or \n                                                \n7  Crouch, M. and Lindsey, T. 2014. Law, Society and Transition in Myanmar.

Output 2: Skills and knowledge of government staff on updated and modernized \ncommercial and financial laws improved. The shift to new laws with a private sector outlook \nwill require a change in the outlook of staff, and new skills will be required. The output will \nsupport  training  and  capacity  development  of  SCU  members  in  the  principles  and \nimplementation of the updated insolvency law, and Directorate of Investment and Company \nAdministration staff in the principles and implementation of the new sections of the company \nlaw.9 During TA implementation, ADB will discuss with the SCU the possibility of providing \nsupport for the establishment of specialized commercial courts, which would enable a critical \nmass of expertise and experience to be established in the adjudication of commercial and \nfinancial cases and conduct of commercial litigation. \n \n9.  Output 3: Skills and knowledge of legal professionals to facilitate commercial \nactivities improved. The focus will be on improving legal education and skills integral to the \npractice and adjudication of commercial law. A practical commercial and financial law curriculum \nwill be developed and the following areas will be considered for inclusion: \n(i)  commercial and financial contracts, such as sale and purchase agreements, shareholder \nagreements, and joint venture agreements; and commercial litigation; \n(ii)  the  proposed  new  company  law,  understanding corporate structures, formation  and \nregistration of companies, corporate governance, shareholder disputes, and principles of \ninsolvency law; \n(iii)  contracts in international financing transactions such as financing agreements, taking \nand enforcing charges, understanding creditor rights and secured assets, and preparing \nlegal opinions; \n(iv)  international  commercial  arbitration  law  and  practice,  and  other  alternative  dispute \nresolution mechanisms in international transactions; and \n(v)  environmental law, enforcement, and practice.10 \n \n10.  A  separate  commercial  and  financial  law  curriculum  and  training  programs  will  be \ndeveloped for the three groups participating in the training program: (i) judges of the district \ncourts and high courts, (ii) the Union Attorney General\u2019s Office, and (iii) private practice lawyers \nwith a basic understanding of commercial and financial law. The curriculum for each group may \ndiffer, depending on the group\u2019s needs and competencies, which will be further discussed and \nfinalized during TA implementation. \n \n11.  The training program under output 3 will be conducted in two phases; phase 1 will be \nimplemented in 2016\u20132017 and phase 2 will be implemented in 2017\u20132018. The timing and \nduration of each phase will be discussed further  with the executing agency, implementing \nagencies, and the proposed trainers. The training will be interactive and participatory, using \nsimulation exercises and case studies. Modules will focus on enhancing practical commercial \n                                                \n9  The training to Directorate of Investment and Company Administration staff on the new company law will be \nconducted in close coordination with ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department to ensure there is no duplication with the \nsupport being provided under ADB. 2014.

Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,262,626, of which $1,250,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space for consultants, organization of \nconferences and workshops, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The SCU will be the executing agency for this TA. The implementing agencies will be the \nSCU and the Union Attorney General\u2019s Office. The TA will be implemented from January 2016 \nto December 2019. All consultants will be required to coordinate their work. Consultants will be \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as \namended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 2.11 \nDisbursements will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n14.
