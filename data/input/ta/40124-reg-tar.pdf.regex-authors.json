A delegation from the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) visited the \nSouth Asia Department (SARD) at the headquarters of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on 6\u20137 \nFebruary 2006 to discuss and identify areas for more intensive operational partnerships in South Asia, \nparticularly the establishment of a grant financing facility.1  AusAID and SARD noted that although \nSouth Asia is attracting international attention because of its robust economic performance, it faces \nsignificant development challenges, and identified five key areas for cooperation: (i) governance; (ii) \npromotion  of  inclusive  growth;  (iii)  challenges  associated  with  rapid  urbanization  and  the  rise  of \nmegacities; (iv) human resource development, particularly improved delivery of social services (e.g., \neducation, health, water and sanitation); and (v) regional cooperation and integration. This proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  has  been  prepared  to  address  these  challenges  and  the  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The global community views South Asia as the next rapid growth area after East Asia. The \nhuman development realities in the region are sobering, however. For example, South Asia has the \nmost people living below the US$1 per day poverty line, the largest proportion of illiterate people, the \nmost out-of-school children, and the most children dying before reaching the age of 5. \n \n3.  AusAID and ADB see the following significant development challenges emerging in South Asia. \n \n(i)  There is a growing need to institute measures to ensure enhancement of governance. In \nparticular, there is a need to build (a) more effective mechanisms  for delivery of social \nservices  to  end  users  (e.g.  through  devolution),  and  more  streamlined  public \nadministration systems to facilitate development of such mechanisms; and (b) sound \nfoundations of good governance in institutions addressing public resource management, \ngender mainstreaming, judicial administration, and anticorruption.  \n \n(ii)  It is necessary to take steps to ensure inclusive growth in South Asia. Future economic \ngrowth  and  employment  opportunities  will  demand  skills  that  school  dropouts  lack, \neffectively  reducing  employment  opportunities  for  the  illiterate  poor.  In  addition, \neconomic growth in South Asia has not necessarily led to substantial improvements in \nthe quality of life of the poor.  \n \n(iii)  South Asia is experiencing rapid urbanization and the rise of megacities, bringing both \nimmense opportunities in relation to ongoing globalization, but also challenges. By 2015, \nfive of the world\u2019s 13 megacities will be located in South Asia. These megacities can \nspur economic growth, but also pose challenges, including the \u201curbanization of poverty\u201d \nphenomenon.  The  importance  of  appropriate  urban  management\u2014which  secures \ninfrastructure financing, effectively delivers services, and promotes responsible urban \ndevelopment (e.g. secondary towns and cities)  and participatory local governance\u2014will \nincrease in the future. \n \n(iv)  Even  as  South  Asia  searches  for  appropriate  approaches  to  the  management  of  \nmegacities, balanced and sustainable development requires significant increases in the \n                                                 \n1    The Australia-ADB South Asia Development Partnership Facility (AASADPF) which will  finance innovative development \nservices that address some major challenges faced by developing member countries (DMCs) in South Asia, comprising  \nAfghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Although the realignment of the \nregional departments effective 1 May 2006 has transferred Afghanistan and Pakistan from SARD to the Central and West  \nAsia Department (CWRD), AusAID has agreed to continue to include Afghanistan and Pakistan under AASADPF. Thus, in \nthis paper, South Asia covers all eight DMCs mentioned above. ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved the establishment of \nthe AASADPF on 7 June 2006. The AASADPF will be supported by A$11 million (about US$8.5 million equivalent at the \ncurrent exchange rate) from the Government of Australia (the Government) over the next 5 years. \n2    The concept paper on the TA was approved by ADB Management on 15 May 2006. The TA first appeared in ADB \nBusiness Opportunities on 19 May 2006. \n ", "2   \nprovision  and  effectiveness  of  public  and  private  social  services,  in  areas  such  as \neducation, health, and water supply and sanitation. Significant improvements in human \nresources are required to deliver the needed high quality and timely social services. \n \n(v)  The Islamabad Declaration developed during the 12th Summit (January 2004) of the \nSouth  Asian  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC)  pledged  to  intensify \ncooperation  and  eradicate  poverty  in  South  Asia,  and  to  resolve  any  conflict  and \ndisputes through peaceful means. During the 13th SAARC Summit, held in Dhaka in \nNovember 2005, the heads of state or government of the SAARC member countries (the \nSAARC leaders) stressed that accelerating cooperation in core economic areas was of \nvital importance to making South Asia truly vibrant, dynamic, and secure.3 South Asia\u2019s \ninterest in developing closer cooperation with regional groupings in Southeast Asia, the \nGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS), and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN)  is  also  increasing.  Countries  in  South  and  Southeast  Asia  have  started \ninterregional  cooperation  initiatives,  such  as  the  Bay  of  Bengal  Initiative  for  Multi-\nSectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC).  \n \n \n4.  Efforts to enhance the quality of and access to basic services must focus on the institutions \nresponsible for delivery of basic services, in addition to more commonly emphasized sector-specific \nissues.    Many  institutional  issues  are  multisectoral,  involving  complex  governance  and  financing \nconsiderations. The core issue\u2014underlying the need for institutional reform, and for enhanced basic \nservice delivery mechanisms\u2014is ensuring enhanced governance in the countries of the region.4 As the \npace of economic globalization has increased, economic interdependence among countries in South \nAsia has progressively deepened. South Asia has recently achieved remarkable economic growth, \nleading to intensification of linkages with international and regional markets. Further strengthening of \nregional  cooperation  and  integration  has  become  essential  to  maintaining  economic  growth  and \nreducing poverty. The region\u2019s countries face many common challenges, and both AusAID and ADB \nare increasing their operational emphasis on South Asia;  consequently, a regional approach covering \nSouth Asia is considered appropriate for the proposed technical assistance (TA). The TA is in line with \nADB\u2019s overall vision for Asia and the Pacific, the Medium-Term Strategy II (2006-2008), regional \ncooperation strategy and programs, and country strategy and programs for DMCs in South Asia. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The  intended  overall  impact  of  the  proposed  regional  TA\u2014the  Development  Partnership \nProgram for South Asia (DPPSA)\u2014is sustained progress made by participating DMCs in South Asia \ntoward attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).5 The envisaged outcome under the \nDPPSA is innovative approaches to addressing key development challenges in South Asia, which will \nbe  implemented,  evaluated,  documented,  and  disseminated  within  the  region  and  to  other  Asian \ncountries.6 DPPSA outputs comprise (i) development and implementation of innovative programs that \nwill address key development challenges; (ii) targeted assessments aimed at enhancing the analytical \n                                                 \n3    At the Summit, the SAARC leaders agreed to invite Afghanistan to join as SAARC\u2019s eighth member. \n4    Enhanced governance implies a greater focus on accountability of service providers, transparency in the provision of \nservices, and end users\u2019 participation in the design and delivery of such services. Participation by end users throughout \nthe process increases the likelihood of positive impacts on the population. \n5     The MDGs comprise eight goals: (i) eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; (ii) achieve universal primary education; (iii) \npromote gender equality and empower women; (iv) reduce child mortality; (v) improve maternal health; (vi) combat \nHIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases; (vii) ensure environmental sustainability; and (viii) develop a global partnership for \ndevelopment. \n6    In  keeping  with  the  ongoing  Innovation  and  Efficiency  Initiative,  additional  benefits  of  the  proposed  TA  include:  \n(i) improvements in operational efficiency in providing high quality development assistance services to DMCs in South \nAsia, by increasing the quality of ADB services to address the development challenges selected for DPPSA, rather than \non associated paper preparation; and (ii) reduction in the number of TA papers prepared during the next 5 years.   \n ", "  3\nbasis  for  policy  dialogue  and  raising  awareness  on,  and  building  capacity  for,  key  development \nchallenges;  (iii)  regional  cooperation  and  integration  activities;  and  (iv)  information  dissemination \nactivities that will identify, compile, and disseminate good practices and lessons learned for addressing \nthe major challenges facing South Asia. These outputs will support the impact and outcome of the \nproposed TA. \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  Eligibility. Countries eligible for financing under the proposed regional TA are Afghanistan, \nBangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.7 Projects and programs must \naddress one or more of five prioritized areas: (i) enhanced governance, particularly at the local level, \nwhere service delivery interfaces with end users, and including an emphasis on decentralization and \ndevolution  in  countries  of  the  region;  (ii)  urban  infrastructure  and  service  delivery,  including  in \nmegacities and secondary cities and towns, and associated issues such as municipal financing for \nmuch needed infrastructure and participatory local governance;8 (iii) inclusive growth, so that gains \nfrom economic development are shared by as wide a population base as possible; (iv) human resource \ndevelopment,  particularly  in  targeting  improved  service delivery  in  education,  health,  9  water  and \nsanitation, and other social services; and (v) regional cooperation and integration.10 DPPSA financing \nwill primarily focus on innovative interventions through technical assistance operations, while targeted \nassessments, regional cooperation and integration activities, and information dissemination activities \nwill also be conducted.11 The total financing requirement from DPPSA for each proposed project or \nprogram should normally not exceed US$500,000,12 and they should focus on one or more of DPPSA\u2019s \nfive key eligible areas. Each project or program will take the form of an innovative intervention, a \ntargeted assessment, a regional cooperation and integration activity, or an information dissemination \nactivity. Proposed projects or programs should be in addition to, and not substitute for, ADB\u2019s ongoing \nor programmed activities.  \n \n7.  Selection Procedures. Proposals will be reviewed and recommendations for funding will be \nmade on the basis of the selection criteria specified in Appendix 2.  \n \n8.  Output  1:  Innovative  Interventions.  The  proposed  TA  will  support  innovative  ideas  that \ndemonstrate unique institutional arrangements, participatory approaches, or technical solutions that fit \nthe  domestic  situation  in  participating  DMCs,  while  clearly  identifying  the  potential  for  successful \n                                                 \n7    AusAID and ADB have agreed that support to Afghanistan under the proposed TA will focus solely on regional integration \nand cooperation, because the operation area of the AusAID counterpart office\u2014North and South Asia Section\u2014does not \ninclude Afghanistan. In addition, AusAID is phasing out its development cooperation with India as a result of the \nGovernment of India\u2019s decision in 2003 to limit its development engagement to a reduced number of bilateral aid donors. \nAusAID and ADB have thus agreed that support to India under the proposed TA will focus primarily on integration and \ncooperation activities.   \n8    Including knowledge generation and dissemination protocols that enable local experiences to be fed back into national \npolicy-making processes. \n9   AusAID and ADB have agreed not to finance the following family planning activities without the prior written consent of the \nGovernment of Australia: (i) family planning services, including counseling; (ii) training in the practice of family planning; \n(iii) distributing contraceptives for family planning purposes; (iv) developing and distributing family planning information, \neducation, and communication materials; and (v) capacity building for organizations that deliver family planning. Other \nactivities, which target diseases such as HIV/AIDS, and avian influenza and other emerging diseases, may be financed by \nthe Government over and above A$11 million, through a separate agreement between AusAID and ADB.  \n10   Regional cooperation and integration activities will include those undertaken by SARD and CWRD, and also the work of \nADB\u2019s Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI); the latter proposals should have South Asia as a primary focus in \norder to access financing from the proposed TA.  \n11   Where viability and sustainability are ensured, components of investment projects and stand-alone grant-financed work \nmay also be considered for financing. \n12   This threshold amount is proposed based on assessments of the average project size financed under existing trust funds \nprovided by the Governments of Japan, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Under special cases, with advisory panel \napproval, proposals greater than US$500,000 may be considered. \n ", "4   \nreplication, mainstreaming, and/or upscaling in one or more countries. Public\u2013private partnership (PPP) \nopportunities and working with nongovernment organizations (NGOs) will be encouraged. \n \n9.  Output 2: Targeted Assessments. This component will include activities aimed at enhancing \nthe analytical basis for policy dialogue and raising awareness on, and building capacity for, addressing \nkey development challenges faced by South Asia. Activities include focused studies; action research; \nand targeted activities aimed at removing regulatory, policy-related, institutional, organizational, social, \ntechnical, and financial barriers to improved basic service delivery at the local level, including identifying \nopportunities  for  PPP  and  working  with  NGOs.  Assessments  will  have  strong  linkages  to  ADB \noperations for implementation of the findings, will answer some of the key development challenges13 \nfaced by South Asia, and will be an important discussion base for policy dialogue.   \n10.  Output 3: Regional Cooperation and Integration. This component will include activities to \nenhance regional cooperation and integration among DMCs in South Asia and support their efforts to \ncooperate and integrate with other economies within and outside Asia. Activities will include, among \nothers, strategically important regional conferences, workshops, and assessments. \n11.  Output 4: Information Dissemination. This component will identify, compile, and disseminate \ngood practices and lessons learned for addressing development issues covered by the proposed TA. \nThe  component  will  include  awareness  campaigns,  capacity-building  activities,  conferences  and \nworkshops, publication of lessons learned, and integration of the knowledge gained into the information \ndissemination and the knowledge management activities of the Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment  (RSDD).  As  part  of  ADB\u2019s  information  dissemination  effort,  a  communication  and \ninformation  dissemination  plan  will  be  developed  to  identify  effective  dissemination  methods  and \nvenues, including internet and intranet-based information management.   \nC.   Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at A$11 million (about US$8.5 million equivalent at the \ncurrent exchange rate). The proposed TA will be financed on a grant basis by the AASADPF, funded by \nthe Government of Australia.14 The cost estimates include consulting services, equipment, materials, \nconferences, workshops, information dissemination activities including publications, and administrative \ncosts.15 The cost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 3. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the executing agency for the proposed TA, which will be implemented over 6 years, \nstarting from the approval date of the proposed TA.16 \n14.  Proposals will be actively solicited and reviewed periodically. The Country Coordination and \nRegional Cooperation Division (SAOC) of SARD will administer the proposed TA in close coordination \nwith relevant sector divisions of SARD and Central and West Asia Department (CWRD), technical \nexperts from RSDD, and other offices17 relevant to the proposed TA operations. \n \n15.  The directors of relevant divisions of SARD and CWRD as well as country directors of the \nresident missions in South Asia will send proposals to a secretariat to be established for the AASADPF \n                                                 \n13   One particular challenge is the relationship between improved basic service delivery and the impact on poor people\u2019s \nlivelihood, health, and vulnerability. \n14  On 19 April 2006, AusAID approved its contribution to AASADPF totaling A$11 million over the next 5 years. \n15   Civil works may also be financed. \n16   Implementation over 6 years from the date of approval of the proposed regional TA is recommended, to give sufficient \ntime for implementation of projects or programs approved in the 5th year of AASADPF operations; proposals will be \napproved during the AASADPF 5-year operational period. Assistance to each participating DMC will not begin until ADB \nreceives a confirmation of no objection from the participating DMC government. \n17   Relevant offices include the Office of the General Counsel (OGC), Controller\u2019s Department, Central Operations Services \nOffice (COSO), Department of External Relations, Office of Cofinancing Operations (OCO) and Office of Regional \nEconomic Integration (OREI). \n ", "  5\n(AASADPF secretariat).18 Proposals need to meet the eligibility criteria, including ensuring consistency \nbetween the proposals and ADB\u2019s regional cooperation strategy and programs and country strategy \nand programs for the eligible countries, and road maps relevant to the proposed TA.19 The AASADPF \nsecretariat will undertake initial proposal reviews20 and make recommendations to a DPPSA advisory \npanel. \n16.  The  DPPSA  advisory  panel  will  be  headed  by  the  director  of  SAOC  and  will  comprise \nrepresentatives of SARD, CWRD, and RSDD. It will have overall program oversight responsibilities, \nincluding  reviewing  and  approving  proposals  and  overseeing  progress  in  implementing  approved \nprojects. Proposals will be reviewed, prioritized based on the eligibility and selection criteria (Appendix \n2), and selected for funding. Resident missions and relevant sector divisions of SARD and CWRD are \nresponsible  for  ensuring  consistency  in  the  proposals,  supervising  implementation  progress,  and \nperiodically reporting progress to the AASADPF secretariat.   \n17.  The AASADPF secretariat will be responsible for the day-to-day management of DPPSA and \nAASADPF, including the use of AASADPF funds. The AASADPF secretariat will regularly collaborate \nwith relevant departments and offices to eliminate any duplication and/or conflict with other similar fund \noperations or research activities promoted by ADB.21 The AASADPF secretariat will work with ADB\u2019s \nDepartment of External Relations to develop and implement an information dissemination plan to \nidentify effective dissemination venues and methods, and collaborate with similar initiatives conducted \nby ADB\u2019s development partners, including NGOs, to enhance synergy, co-host workshops, and explore \nfuture collaboration for TA implementation.   \n \n18.  ADB will recruit consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Their \ntasks will include evaluating and preparing a completion report for each approved TA activity. Civil \nworks, equipment, and materials to be financed by the TA will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines.   \n \n19.  Progress reports on the proposed TA and use of the AASADPF will be prepared annually by the \nAASADPF secretariat in collaboration with the Controller\u2019s Department and the Office of Cofinancing \nOperations. TA activities will be monitored and reports made available through the TA website. \n   \nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n20.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering technical assistance not \nexceeding A$11 million (about US$8.5 million equivalent) to be financed on a grant basis by the \nAustralia-ADB South Asia Development Partnership Facility for the Development Partnership Program \nfor South Asia. \n                                                 \n18   The AASADPF secretariat will comprise representatives of SARD and CWRD and a consultant. The secretariat will not \npassively receive proposals, but  will work with participating DMCs, through sector staff members and resident missions, \nto develop specific proposals that fit the criteria, while maintaining the overall balance of activities financed under DPPSA. \n19    Criteria also include confirmation of (i) approvals by participating DMC governments of the proposed projects or programs, \nand (ii) budgetary appropriations to such projects and programs. \n20   Due diligence in the fields of consulting services and procurement, legal aspects, and environment and social matters will \nalso be conducted by COSO, OGC, and RSDD. \n21    The close coordination required includes (i) OCO-managed funds such as the Japan Special Fund and Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction; (ii) RSDD-managed funds such as the (a) Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, (b) Governance \nCooperation Fund, (c) Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector, (d) Poverty and Environment Fund, (e) Gender and \nDevelopment Fund, (f) PRC Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund; and (iii) other similar funds and research \ninitiatives supported by ADB through regional departments and OCO.    \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumption \n   \nSustained progress made  Yearly improvement in the  Regional and national  Flexible financing is available \nby participating  project areas in the  statistics  for activities that address the \ndeveloping member  sectors and areas    changing development \ncountries (DMCs) in South  identified in the MDGs   United Nations Human  challenges in South Asia  \nAsia toward attaining the  Development reports   Risk \nMillennium Development    External developments may \nGoals (MDGs)1 Reports on attainments of the  negatively impact progress \nMDGs  toward attaining the MDGs\n   \nOutcome      Assumption \n \n \nInnovative approaches in  At least 3\u20134 innovative  Overall technical assistance  A cost-effective and simple \naddressing key  projects or programs  (TA) progress and monitoring  monitoring and management \ndevelopment challenges  ready for upscaling and  reports  system is adopted  in order to \nin South Asia will be  replication of    ensure that activities will be \nProgress reports on each \nimplemented, evaluated,  interventions, through  accurately monitored and that  \nproject/program \ndocumented, and  Asian Development Bank  lessons learned will be \n \n \ndisseminated within the  (ADB) operations    documented \nregion and to other Asian     Risk \ncountries   \nEmerging differences in \nperspectives and priorities in the \nfuture among the following: \nparticipating DMCs; Australian \nAgency for International \nDevelopment (AusAID); ADB\u2019s \nSouth Asia Department (SARD), \nCentral and West Asia \nDepartment (CWRD), and \nresident missions; and partner \norganizations  \n \nOutputs      Assumption \n   \n1.

To be eligible for funding, each proposal \n \n(i)  must be approved during the Australia-ADB South Asia Development Partnership \nFacility (AASADPF) period;1 \n(ii)  must be implemented within the participating developing member countries (DMCs) \nduring the proposed regional technical assistance (TA) period;2 \n(iii)  must focus on interventions in one or more of the five prioritized areas identified for \nthe Development Partnership Program for South Asia (DPPSA) and be in keeping \nwith ADB\u2019s overall vision for Asia and the Pacific, the Medium-Term Strategy II \n(2006-2008), regional cooperation strategy and programs, and country strategy and \nprograms for eligible countries and road maps relevant to the proposed TA;3 \n(iv)  must be in addition to, and not substitute for, ongoing or programmed activities;  \n(v)  should normally not cost more than US$500,000;4 and \n(vi)  must  have  clear  objectives,  performance  indicators,  monitoring  mechanisms,  a \nrealistic budget, and appropriate cost control systems for managing expenditures. \n \n2.  DMCs  eligible  for  financing  under  the  proposed  TA  are  Afghanistan,  Bangladesh, \nBhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.5 \n \n3.  Eligible activities are those focusing on (i) enhanced governance, particularly at the local \nlevel,  where  service  delivery  interfaces  with  end  users,  and  including  an  emphasis  on \ndecentralization and devolution in countries of the region; (ii) urban infrastructure and service \ndelivery, including in megacities and secondary cities and towns, and associated issues such as \nmunicipal financing for much needed infrastructure and participatory local level governance;6 \n(iii) inclusive growth, so that the gains from economic development are shared by as wide a \npopulation  base  as  possible;  (iv)  human  resource  development,  particularly  in  targeting \nimproved service delivery in education, health,7 water and sanitation, and other such social \nservices; and (v) regional cooperation and integration.8 \n                                                 \n1   Five years from June 2006.

Extension may be considered if AusAID and \nADB agree to such a necessity. \n3     Including confirmation of approvals by participating DMC governments of the proposed projects or programs and \nbudgetary appropriations to such projects and programs. \n4    Under special cases, with advisory panel approval, proposals greater than US$500,000 may be considered.  \n5   Although the realignment of the regional departments effective 1 May 2006 has transferred Afghanistan and \nPakistan from South Asia Department (SARD) to Central and West  Asia Department (CWRD), AusAID has \nagreed to continue to include Afghanistan and Pakistan. Thus, in this paper, South Asia covers all eight DMCs \nmentioned above. AusAID and ADB have agreed that support to Afghanistan under the proposed TA will focus \nsolely on regional integration and cooperation, because the operation area of the AusAID counterpart office\u2014\nNorth and South Asia Section\u2014does not include Afghanistan. In addition, AusAID is phasing out its development \ncooperation with India as a result of the Government of India\u2019s decision in 2003 to limit its development \nengagement to a reduced number of bilateral aid donors. AusAID and ADB have thus agreed that support to \nIndia under the proposed TA will focus primarily on regional integration and cooperation activities. \n6   Including knowledge generation and dissemination protocols that enable local experiences to be fed back into \nnational policy-making processes. \n7    AusAID and ADB have agreed not to finance the following family planning activities without the prior written \nconsent of the Government of Australia: (i) family planning services, including counseling; (ii) training in the \npractice of family planning; (iii) distributing contraceptives for family planning purposes; (iv) developing and \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \n \nProjects will be selected on a competitive basis within the participating DMCs.
