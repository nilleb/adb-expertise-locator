The  Government  of  Bhutan  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \nassistance to strengthen the capacity of the Department of Labour (DOL) of the Ministry of \nLabour and Human Resources (MLHR) to implement the Labour and Employment Act (the Act) \nand related rules and regulations.1 An ADB fact-finding mission2 visited Bhutan on 5\u20137 October \n2005 to discuss the technical assistance (TA), and agreed on the TA design, activities, outputs, \nfinancing and implementation arrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference. Because of \nthe delay in the approval of the labor administration policy and submission of the Act to the \nNational Assembly, the TA was postponed and is now in the TA program for Bhutan for 2007. A \nconsultation mission3 visited Bhutan on 12\u201314 September 2006 to validate and update, where \nnecessary, the design, activities, outputs, financing, and implementation arrangements, and \nconsultants\u2019  terms  of  reference. 4  The  mission\u2019s  findings  and  understandings  with  the \nGovernment formed the basis for formulating the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Bhutan\u2019s development strategy, as presented in the Ninth Five Year Plan 2002\u20132007 \n(and in the Eighth Five Year Plan) identifies the private sector as the main source of future \nincome generation and job creation opportunities. However, the private sector has been slow to \nassume this role because of, among others, the lack of physical infrastructure, the narrow skills \nbase, weak financial institutions, the absence of a regulatory framework, and the reluctance of \nyouth, both skilled and unskilled, to join the private sector. The policy document, A Vision for \nPeace, Prosperity and Happiness (Bhutan 2020 Vision), identifies a number of reasons for the \nlast reason, including low respect for the dignity of labor, the failure to see real growth in the \nprivate sector, doubts about career prospects, job insecurity, and bad overall working conditions, \nincluding poor occupational health and safety (OHS).  \n \n3.  To encourage youth to join the private sector, an effective labor administration system \nand legal framework is needed. In keeping with the country\u2019s guiding principles, as outlined in \nBhutan 2020 Vision, private sector growth must strike a balance between economic efficiency to \nensure sustainability and competitiveness of enterprises, and social justice and equity to ensure \nthe fair treatment and adequate protection of workers. Finding and maintaining that balance falls \nwithin the responsibilities of the MLHR and, more specifically, with the DOL.  \n \n4.  Against this background, ADB provided TA 3790-BHU for Institutional Development of \nthe Department of Employment and Labour,5 which at that time was part of the Ministry of \nHealth  and  Education.  The  TA\u2019s  overall  objective  was  to  strengthen  labor  administration. \nSpecific objectives included (i) developing a comprehensive labor administration policy, (ii) \nstrengthening the capacity of the Department of Employment and Labour (DEL) and its staff to \nbecome  the  lead  agency  in  labor  administration,  and  (iii)  developing  the  legal  framework \nnecessary for DEL to fulfill its mandate. TA outputs were (i) a draft policy document, Labour \nAdministration:  Finding  a  Balance,  including  a  master  plan  to  establish  the  MLHR  and  a \n                                                 \n1 The TA was originally included in the TA program for 2005 under the title: TA for Implementing the Labour and \nEmployment Act. \n2 The fact-finding mission consisted of Caroline Vandenabeele, senior counsel, mission leader. \n3 The consultation mission consisted of Caroline Vandenabeele, senior counsel, mission leader. \n4 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 10 November 2005. \n5 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Institutional Development of the Department of \nEmployment and Labour. Manila. \n ", "2   \nNational Employment Policy; (ii) a staff desk manual covering several technical areas of labor \nadministration and various areas of skills development; (iii) a draft labour and employment act; \n(iv) an initial in-house training program for DEL staff; (v) workshops to discuss (i) and (iii); and \n(vi) the organization of the first job fair in Bhutan.  \n \n5.  The labor administration policy together with the master plan directly helped transform \nthe DEL into the MLHR. Several components of the labor administration policy as well as its \nimplementation mechanism were de facto endorsed at an early stage. This was evidenced by \nthe structural arrangements of the newly established MLHR, by the formal endorsement of the \nMLHR staffing plan, by the conduct of several job fairs, and by the establishment of a one-stop \nshop for employment matters. In July 2006, the Council of Ministers formally approved the \nLabour Administration Policy, firmly anchoring the mandate of the MLHR in areas such as labor \ninspection, labor administration, and OHS.  \n \n6.   The Council of Ministers endorsed the draft Labour and Employment Act in mid-October \n2006 after some delays arising from a cautious approach to ensure consistency between the \nAct and the Constitution, which is proposed to be submitted to the National Assembly during its \nsummer session of 2008. The National Assembly enacted the Labour and Employment Act on 5 \nJanuary 2007. To ensure high compliance with all labor legislation, continued awareness raising, \ninformation and advice is needed, and inspection and enforcement must be developed and \nsupported. \n \n7.  Moreover, cognizant of the need for a strong legal framework, the Council of Ministers \napproved in July 2006 two sets of rules and regulations prepared by the DOL, based on the \ndraft Act. One is Rules and Regulations Governing Employment Agencies in Bhutan, 2006, and \nthe other General Rules and Regulations on Occupational Health and Safety in Construction, \nManufacturing, Mining and Service Industries, 2006.  The Government has requested the ADB \nfor  assistance  to  improve  existing  rules  and  regulations, to  draft  additional  legislation  and \nstandards, and to train DOL staff to implement and supervise these rules and regulations. \nImplementing rules and regulations covering several other areas of the Act also need to be \ndrafted. These include, for example, rules and regulations related to labor inspection, labor\u2013\nmanagement relations, as well as dispute prevention and settlement. \n \n8.  In  line  with  the  approval  of  the  MLHR  staffing  plan  by  the  Royal  Civil  Service \nCommission, 10 labor inspectors and 2 labor relations officers have been recruited and are in \nplace. The inspectors, who are fresh graduates, need to be trained in the nature, purpose, and \ntechniques of an integrated labor inspection system in a small country. Procedural manuals as \nwell as reporting instruments to assess enterprises\u2019 compliance with labor and employment-\nrelated legislation also need to be developed. In view of the complete novelty of labor inspection \nand the lack of experienced labor inspectors who can serve as role models, in-country training \nmust be complemented with training activity in the region, giving the new recruits a better \nunderstanding of what labor inspection entails and how it functions in the field. Labor relations \nofficers must also be trained to ensure compliance with the Act\u2019s labor\u2013management provisions, \nand to promote sound and constructive worker\u2013management relations at the enterprise level. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be to further strengthen the labor administration system, \nthereby  contributing  to  the  growth  of  the  private  sector  as  a  viable,  promising,  and  safe \n ", "  3\nemployment alternative to the public sector. The expected outcome will be that workers and \nemployers have increased access to an efficient, effective, and transparent labor administration \nsystem.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Key activities under the TA include (i) activities to enhance the legal framework, (ii) \ncapacity development for DOL staff, and (iii) strengthened institutional arrangements to ensure \nlabor legislation compliance.  \n \n11.  Activities that will enhance the legal framework include the following:  \n(i)   Together  with  the  DOL  legal  officer,  a  series  of  labor-related  rules  and \nregulations to implement the Act will be drafted, issued, and applied. Priority \nareas will be decided in close cooperation with the DOL director, but will include \nat least labor inspection, labor\u2013management relations, and dispute prevention \nand settlement. \n(ii)   Based  on  a  comprehensive  survey  and  assessment  of  OHS  in  industries, \nconstruction, and manufacturing, the existing OHS rules and regulations will be \nrevised, a  comprehensive OHS policy prepared, and detailed standards and \ncodes of behavior developed. \n(iii)   Public awareness materials on the Act and the rules and regulations will be \nprepared and distributed. \n \n12.  Capacity development activities will focus on training labor inspectors and labor relations \nofficers, as well as other stakeholders as appropriate. These activities will include the following:  \n(i)   Training of at least 10 labor inspectors, operating under an integrated inspection \nsystem, will involve training-room, on-site, and online instruction and activities. \nTo ensure that inspectors can apply the acquired knowledge and skills, the TA \nwill support the purchase of basic equipment to measure noise, heat, humidity, \ndust, and illumination.  \n(ii)   To complement in-country training, the new labor inspectors will be exposed to \nthe workings of an integrated inspectorate in a country in the region through a \nregional  training  activity  under  the  supervision  of  the  labor  administration \nconsultant.  \n(iii)   At  least  four  labor  relations  officers  will  be  trained  to  improve  worker\u2013\nmanagement relations at the enterprise level, including to prevent and settle \ndisputes. For part of this training, employers and employee representatives will \nbe invited to participate.  \n \n13.  To strengthen the institutional arrangements, the TA will do the following:  \n(i)   Help prepare and test procedural manuals, templates for labor inspection report \nforms and related documents such as noncompliance notices and improvement \nand prohibition notices, as well as templates for conciliation, mediation, and \nrelated  reports.  The  templates\u2019  formats  will  be  discussed  with  stakeholders \nbefore finalization.  \n(ii)   Help the DOL draw up its inputs into the 10th Five Year Plan. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $340,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide \n$300,000 to finance consulting services, training and workshops, the production of desk books, \n ", "4   \ntraining materials and dissemination materials, an enterprise survey on OHS, the purchase of \nbasic  equipment  kits  for  labor  inspectors,  and  a  regional  training  activity.  The  TA  will  be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  Government\u2019s  contribution, \nestimated at $40,000 equivalent, will be in kind and will include office accommodation and \ntransport for field visits, counterpart staff remuneration, and miscellaneous administrative and \nsupport services. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The DOL will be the Executing Agency, and a senior staff member of the DOL will be \nappointed focal person for the TA.  \n \n16.  The TA will require a total of 12 person-months of consultants\u2019 services (10 person-\nmonths\u2019  international  and  2  person-months\u2019  national  consultants).  The  consultants  will  be \nindividually recruited in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, \nas amended from time to time). One international consultant with extensive experience in labor \nadministration;  labor  administration  skills  development  and  training;  and  preparation  of \nregulations, guidelines, and outreach materials will be engaged for a total of 7 person-months \nspread over three periods during the TA. The DOL has requested ADB to use single-source \nselection to recruit the labor administration consultant who assisted the DOL under TA 3790-\nBHU, in view of his knowledge and understanding of the Bhutanese context and his extensive \nexperience with labor administration, and because the current TA is a continuation of the work \ndone under TA 3790-BHU. The labor administration consultant will accompany, as trainer, the \nlabor inspectors on their regional training and will act as the team leader for the TA. \n \n17.  A second international consultant, with extensive experience in preparing OHS policies \nand experience in drafting OHS legislation and standards, will be recruited for 3 person-months. \nHe or she will overlap for at least 6 weeks with the labor administration consultant to ensure \nconsistency and complementarity in the training of the labor inspectors. He or she will be \nsupported by a national consultant for 2 person-months to prepare and conduct a survey and \nassess the OHS situation. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  Equipment will be procured by the Government in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time). The TA will be implemented over 16 \nmonths, from February 2007 to May 2008. The schedule of training activities will be agreed \nupon with the DOL and scheduled to ensure maximum attendance by DOL staff. Stakeholders \nwill be consulted on all regulations prepared under the TA.  \n \n19.  The labor administration consultant will submit a brief inception report to the DOL and \nADB within 3 weeks after activities start, which will include a work plan with a proposed time \nframe for all activities, including for regional training. He will submit a draft final report by the \nmiddle  of  the  third  stint  and  a  final  report  on  conclusion  of  the  assignment.  The  OHS \ninternational consultant will submit a brief inception report to the DOL and ADB within 3 weeks \nafter activities start, a brief status report at the end of month two, and a final report when the \nassignment ends.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "  5\nIV.
