The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported the strategy of the Government of Viet \nNam (the Government) for enhancing its competitiveness in the growing market economy through \nhuman  resource  development.  Secondary  education  is  one  of  the  principal  mechanisms  for \nensuring the country\u2019s high level of economic growth as well as for achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and Vietnamese Development Goals. With efforts of the Government and \ndonor partners, the general coverage of secondary schooling has significantly improved. As noted \nin the country\u2019s 5-year Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006\u20132010, however, disadvantaged \nregions  still  suffer  from  various  educational  constraints.  Insufficient  facilities  and  instructional \nmaterials, weak capacity for planning and management, and limited relevance of schooling for \nlocal needs remain as major challenges. More strategic, targeted assistance to the vulnerable \ngroups is crucial for achieving universal secondary education.   \n \n2.  During the Country Strategy and Program Update 2006\u20132008 Mission for Viet Nam in \nMarch 2006, the Government requested ADB support for project preparatory technical assistance \n(TA)  to  develop  the  Secondary  Education  for  the  Most  Disadvantaged  Regions  Project.  The \nFact-Finding  Mission  visited  Viet  Nam  during  3\u201310  May  2006.  The  Mission  reached  an \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  the  TA\u2019s  expected  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost estimates, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for \nconsulting services. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Policy Frameworks. Over the past decade, Viet Nam has enjoyed rapid economic growth \naccompanied by impressive poverty reduction. The Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 \ndistinctly emphasizes the priority given to the education sector. Universal secondary education (for \nlower secondary by 2010 and for upper secondary or professional secondary education by 2015) is \ncurrently the sector\u2019s most urgent policy target. Commitments have been made to this target in \nmajor education planning initiatives, including (i) the Education Sector Development Plan 2001\u2013\n2010, (ii) the National Action Plan for Education for All, (iii) the original Secondary Education \nSector Master Plan (SESMP) 2001\u20132010, (iv) the Strategic Education Development Plan 2006\u2013\n2010, and (v) the new SESMP 2006\u20132010.  \n \n4.  ADB has been supporting secondary education in Viet Nam as the principal funding agency. \nIn 2000, the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) and ADB formulated the original SESMP \n2001\u20132010,  which  emphasized  access  to  secondary  education.2 Under  the  plan,  the  gross \nenrolment rate of lower secondary education has reached 90.4% in the 2005/2006 school year,3 \nand its net enrolment rate was 78.8% in 2004/2005.4 Upper secondary education has also been \npromoted  steadily,  and  its  gross  enrolment  has  reached  55.3%  in  2005/2006  while  the  net \nenrolment rate was 36.6% in 2004/2005.5 Efficiency indicators that include completion rates, the \npupil/teacher ratio, and average learning outcomes have also shown improvement.      \n \n5.  With improvement in the average enrolment rate, however, more difficult challenges to \nachieving universal secondary education have come to the fore. Equality of access, raising quality \nto international standards, sustainable service delivery, and effective donor harmonization are \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 March 2006. \n2  ADB. 2000.

In  this  context,  the  new  SESMP  2006\u20132010  was \ndeveloped by MOET and ADB in collaboration with the Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and United \nNations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF).6 The new SESMP has introduced a results-based approach for \nreviewing sector performance in achieving universal secondary education. It includes a subsector \npublic expenditure review and an action plan for inclusive education development for girls and \nethnic minorities. A national school-mapping plan also has been developed, and demands on \nschool facilities are being projected based on demographic data. An initial poverty assessment and \nsocial analysis based on data from the SESMP is in Appendix 2. The holistic performance review \nunder the SESMP has indicated the following challenges in the subsector: \n \n6.  Inequalities in Secondary Education. Students and youth in the poor regions, compared \nwith those in urban areas, have not equally accessed secondary education. Despite the high \nnational average enrolment rate of 90.4%, only 30 out of 64 provinces have achieved universal \nlower secondary education. Differentiation in access to quality schooling by gender, ethnicity, and \nhousehold income levels persists, and it is even widening in some provinces. While the national \naverage completion rate for lower secondary education was 76.3% in 2004/2005, it was (i) 57.8% \nfor the Mekong River delta, (ii) 73.5% for the central highlands, (iii) 74.9% for the northwest region, \nand (iv) 63.9% on average for ethnic minorities. Also, regional data on average times taken to \nsuccessfully complete lower secondary schooling indicate lower efficiency of services in the remote \nareas. The national average for years to complete the lower secondary level was 4.8 in 2004/2005, \nbut 5.7 for Mekong River delta, 5.0 for the central highlands, 4.8 for the northwest region, and 5.3 \nfor ethnic minorities. In addition to geographical discrepancies, a gender imbalance in attainment \nstill exists. Female students account for 47.5% of the total enrolment. The rate has not improved \nsignificantly over the five years.7 Gender gaps are especially prominent among the poor and in \nsuch rural areas as the northern uplands, Mekong River delta, central coast, and highlands.  \n \n7.  Geographic  Focus  on  Targeted  Assistance.  ADB  has  been  providing  targeted \nassistance to disadvantaged areas, often by including pro-poor components in its projects. The \ndisadvantaged areas targeted by past projects were usually identified by the Government and \noften were very broad, covering almost one third of total provinces. As a result, assistance that \neach province receives in real terms tends to be too small to have significant impacts on improving \naccess  to  schooling.  To  substantially  contribute  to  universalizing  secondary  education,  more \nfocused  investments  in  selected  areas  are  required.  Among  provinces  recognized  as \ndisadvantaged under ongoing projects, the SESMP has assessed some regions as particularly \ndisadvantaged, based on data from the education management information system and a study for \nforecasting future enrolment pressure. The northern mountainous, central highland, and Mekong \nRiver delta regions are included in this most impoverished regions category.  \n \n8.  Standardized Assistance Not Customized to Local Needs. Ongoing targeted assistance \noften  simply  provides  standardized  inputs,  including  civil  works  and  equipment,  to  all  the \nbeneficiary areas. However, a survey on reasons for nonattendance at secondary schools has \nindicated that determining factors for dropping out and nonattendance considerably vary between \nregions.8 To universalize secondary schooling, new school buildings are needed in some areas to \nabsorb higher enrolments, while other provinces may require activities to raise awareness among \nparents and communities in order to remove socio-cultural barriers to out-of-school girls and ethnic \nminorities.  Yet,  current  targeted  assistance  is  supply-driven  and  does  not  fully  address \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2005.

To be effective, targeted \nassistance  needs  to  be  better  tailored  to  local  conditions.  Furthermore,  more  comprehensive \neconomic  analysis  should  be  undertaken  to  evaluate  impacts  and  outcomes  of  ADB-funded \ninterventions on poverty reduction in the beneficiary provinces.  \n \n9.  Challenges  for  a  Decentralized  and  Sustainable  Education  System.  Ongoing \ndecentralization in the education sector has contributed to a rapid rate of improvement in the \nquality of service in some regions. In disadvantaged areas where incomes are low, however, the \ncurrent regulatory framework for decentralization\u2014which delegates autonomy in and responsibility \nfor resource mobilization\u2014has generated significant challenges. Based on UNESCO\u2019s recent pilot \nproject for local capacity development, the SESMP has assessed the training needs of local \neducation authorities. The assessment indicated that increased delegation of power needed to be \nmatched by greater accountability and transparency in determining and allocating budgets at local \nlevels. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  Goal and Objective. The TA\u2019s primary purpose is to conduct a feasibility study and design \na  proposed  project  for  the  Secondary  Education  for  the  Most  Disadvantaged  Regions.  The \noutcome of the TA will constitute the basis for a carefully designed comprehensive project to meet \nthe major needs of secondary education in target areas. This will be based on a detailed survey \nand on an accurate and segregated Education Management Information System (EMIS) data for \neffective target support. The impact of the proposed project will be to provide greater equality of \nopportunities  for  vulnerable  groups  through  achieving  universal  secondary  and  professional \neducation by 2015 and to achieve gender parity consistent with commitments in the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals and Vietnamese Development Goals.  \n \n11.  Expected Deliverables. The TA will design the proposed project to yield (i) significantly \nnarrowed gaps in access to secondary education by ethnicity, gender, and family incomes of target \ngroups;  (ii)  improved  stakeholders\u2019  awareness  of  the  importance  of  secondary  schooling;  (iii) \nimproved relevance of learning to meet local demands in the target provinces and among the \nbeneficiaries;  and  (iv)  a  decentralized  education  service  delivery  system  and  strengthened \nplanning and management capacities of local educational authorities. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  General  Approach.  The  key  strategy  of  the  TA  is  to  mitigate  vulnerability  of  the \ndisadvantaged  groups  through  effective  targeted  assistance  to  secondary  education  in  the \ncountry\u2019s poorest areas. Consistent with recommendations of ADB\u2019s recent study on targeted \napproaches,9 pro-poor interventions under the TA will reflect and meet the local demands and \npropose long-term solutions to education challenges for the poorest groups. To ensure effective \nimplementation, a participatory process is essential to assure congruence between the goals of the \nproposed project and those of local counterparts. The TA is to be built on ADB\u2019s Country Strategy \nand Program 2007\u20132010 for Viet Nam. The resulting project will function as the first investment \nproject supporting the donor coordination matrix on the new SESMP, which coordinates with inputs \nfrom JICA, UNESCO, and UNICEF. The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s policy on education as well as the \npolicies for gender development and indigenous peoples.   \n \n13.  Scope  and  Outputs.  The  TA  will  include  the  following  key  activities:  (i)  analyzing \neducational  statistics  in  disadvantaged  provinces,  developing  selection  criteria  for  the  target \nprovinces and/or districts, and finalizing the 10\u201312 beneficiary provinces and/or districts of the \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n ", "4   \nproposed project; (ii) proposing more support to continuing education centers as an effective and \nsustainable approach; (iii) assessing and developing interventions to mitigate constraints that girls \nand ethnic minorities have faced; (iv) reviewing the appropriateness and efficiency of current \nprograms for both in-service and pre-service teacher training for the disadvantaged areas; (v) \nproposing instructional materials for target areas to complement the standardized materials; (vi) \nidentifying the needs in education facilities and instructional materials in the target areas; (vii) \nassessing management capacity of local stakeholders; (viii) coordinating the ensuing loan design \nwith assistance of partner donors to maximize the synergy and to fulfill commitments to inputs \nagreed in the coordination matrix; and (ix) estimating detailed project costs.       \n \n14.  Proposed  Project  Components.  Subject  to  Government  concurrence,  the  target \ncommunes will be selected from the 10\u201312 most disadvantaged provinces based on a detailed \nfeasibility study and selection criteria to be developed by the TA. The proposed project may have \nthe  following  components  in  consultation  with  the  Government:  (i)  increasing  access  to  and \ncompletion of secondary education for vulnerable groups; (ii) enhancing the quality, relevance, and \noutcomes of secondary learning; (iii) strengthening capacities for education planning, management, \nand  implementation;  and  (iv)  mobilizing  strategic  and  suitable  targeted  assistance  to  the \ndisadvantaged  groups.  Subcomponents  and  individual  activities  will  be  designed  in  close \ncollaboration with MOET, the expected beneficiaries, and donor partners. \n \n15.  Assumptions  and  Potential  Risks.  The  following  assumptions  and  potential  risk \nmitigations for successful implementation of the TA should be satisfied: (i) the Government will \ncontinue  its  commitment  to  universal  secondary  education;  (ii)  the  TA  will  set  out  traceable \nindicators for the results-based performance monitoring; (iii) the cost norm or designated unit costs \nfor official development assistance projects applied to the resulting project will be available upon \nthe Government\u2019s authorization without delay; (iv) the TA will incorporate into the design of the \nensuing loan project lessons learned from other projects in the sector; (v) the harmonization \nprogram for mitigating implementation difficulties will be regularly reviewed; (vi) the TA will be \nimplemented with collaboration of donor partners and periodic joint reviews will be encouraged; \nand (vii) the TA will be consistent with the Government\u2019s policies on indigenous people. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA cost is estimated at $750,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $600,000 equivalent. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of \nJapan. The Government will finance the remaining cost of $150,000 equivalent by providing office \naccommodation, utilities, remuneration and per diems, and communications and transportation of \ncounterpart staff. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing project. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  Organizational Implementation Structure. MOET will be the TA\u2019s executing agency and \nwill provide counterpart support, including a qualified TA project manager acceptable to ADB. \nMOET will establish a project implementation unit comprised of representatives from the relevant \ndepartments of MOET. Provincial departments of education and training and bureaus of education \nand training in target regions will be local counter partners of the project implementation unit. \nOverall guidance for the TA will be the responsibility of the project steering committee chaired by \nthe Vice Minister of MOET. The steering committee will comprise representatives from MOET, the \nMinistry of Planning and Investment, the Ministry of Finance, the State Bank of Viet Nam, the \nOffice  of  Government,  and  other  relevant  agencies.  ADB,  JICA,  UNESCO,  and  UNICEF  will \nconstitute together with selected experts from MOET an aid advisory body to (i) provide technical \n ", "  5\nadvice on the TA implementation and share lessons learned from partner donor projects, and (ii) \nensure that the project design and implementation are in line with the new SESMP. \n \n18.  Consulting Inputs. A team of five international consultants totaling 14 person-months of \ninput and six national consultants totaling 36.5 person-months of input will provide services in the \nfollowing  areas  of  expertise:  (i)  educational  management  and  finance,  (ii)  education  facility \nplanning and data collection, (iii) instructional material planning and management, (iv) teacher \ntraining planning and quality control, (v) education planning for the disadvantaged groups, (vi) \nproject  management  and  monitoring,  and  (vii)  resettlement.  ADB  will  select  and  engage  all \nconsultants through a firm, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of national consultants. A simplified \ntechnical proposal format and the quality and cost-based selection method will be used. The \noutline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4.  \n \n19.  Implementation Period and Timeframe. The TA will be carried out over 10 months in \nthree phases commencing in September 2006 and ending in June 2007. The first phase will be 4.5 \nmonths. At the beginning of month 4, the midterm workshop based on the draft midterm report (the \nfirst draft of the pre-feasibility study report) will be organized. After technical comments from the \nmidterm workshop have been incorporated, a tripartite meeting is scheduled at the beginning of \nmonth 5 to discuss the TA draft final report and final draft pre-feasibility study report with the \nGovernment.  While  the  Government  reviews  the  pre-feasibility  study  report,  selected  national \nconsultants will implement the second phase of the TA for additional data collection over 4 months. \nUpon the Government\u2019s approval of the pre-feasibility study report, the international team leader \nand cost estimation specialist, together with national consultants concerned, will begin finalizing \nthe TA final report and feasibility study report in the third phase, lasting 1.5 months. The final \nworkshop will be organized in the middle of month 10 to present the final version of the TA final \nreport and finalized feasibility study report.  \n \n20.  Reporting  Requirements.  The  consultant  team  will  submit  the  following  reports  and \ndocuments (with submission timing in parentheses): (i) inception report and TA implementation \nplan (month 1), (ii) brief monthly progress reports summarizing activities and achievements against \nthe terms of reference (end of each month), (iii) draft midterm report (beginning of month 4), (iv) \nminutes of the tripartite meeting and draft pre-feasibility study report (beginning of month 5), (v) \ndraft TA final report and pre-feasibility study report with detailed cost estimation (middle of month \n5), (vi) minutes of the final workshop based on revised feasibility study report (middle of month 10), \nand (vii) TA final report and finalized feasibility study report with detailed cost estimation (end of \nmonth  10).
