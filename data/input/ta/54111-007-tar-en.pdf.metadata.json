The transaction technical assistance (TA) cluster was approved on 8 April 2020 in the \namount of $3,000,000 which is being financed on a grant basis by the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB) Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) and is expected to be completed on 31 \nDecember 2022.1 The overall outcome of the TA cluster is gender mainstreaming in Central and \nWest Asia operations expanded and improved. The outputs are (i) gender-inclusive components \nin sovereign projects and programs incorporated; and (ii) developing member countries\u2019 capacity \nfor gender action plan implementation and monitoring of gender equality results enhanced. There \nare twelve subprojects in the TA cluster. Each subproject will contribute to deliver the gender \noutputs of the ensuing loan that it will support, and this will be specified in each subproject \nproposal. The TA cluster\u2019s risk categorization is complex. \n \n2.  Of the twelve subprojects in the TA cluster, four subprojects are ongoing while one \nsubproject is completed (Appendix 2). Six  subprojects will be  processed  and  implemented \nfollowing the processing milestones of the respective loan/grant projects that the subprojects will \nsupport. One of the subprojects will support integration of gender in all projects and monitor the \nimplementation of project gender action plans. As of 22 September 2021, a total of $1,500,000 \nrepresenting 50% of the total TA cluster amount has been committed, of which $407,187 or 27.1% \nhas been disbursed.2 Total uncommitted funds stand at $1,500,000 which will be utilized for the \nremaining subprojects to be processed. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Subproject Scope \n \n3.  The Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) continuously strives to increase the \nnumber of gender mainstreamed projects in its portfolio, especially in the more challenging \nsectors of energy, finance, governance, and transport. As of 3 September 2021, the CWRD \nportfolio  includes  142  projects  supporting  gender  mainstreaming,  of  which  72  projects  are \ncategorized as gender equity theme (GEN) and effective gender mainstreaming (EGM).3 The \nGEN/EGM-categorized projects include 6 energy projects (8%), 7 finance projects (10%), 3 public \nsector management projects (4%), and 11 transport projects (15%).4 Of the other GEN/EGM \ncategorized projects, water and other urban services projects comprise 22%, agriculture projects \nconstitute 17%, and projects in the health and education sectors comprise 14% and 10%, \nrespectively. CWRD\u2019s gender mainstreaming performance at-entry has risen substantially from \n51% in 2019 to 81% in 2020 when the TA cluster started implementation.5 \n \n4.  The  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  poses  challenges  for  gender \nmainstreaming during project processing, implementation, monitoring, and reporting. Restricted \nmobility remains one of the greatest challenges, exacerbating already existing concerns, such as \npoverty, gender inequality, and social exclusion. Gender interventions designed in pre-COVID \n \n1  ADB. 2019. C-TRTA 0046-REG: Preparing and Implementing Gender Inclusive Projects in Central and West Asia. \nManila.    \n2   Please refer to Appendix 2 for the complete discussion of the status of implementation of the ongoing subrpojects.  \n3  Data from Contract Awards and Disbursements as of 3 September 2021. There are 17 project readiness financing \n(PRFs) and special assistance grants (SAGs) that are not counted for gender. \n4  The percentages were computed based on the total number of GEN/EGM categorized projects.  \n5  The increase in gender mainstreaming performance at-entry was also due to the substantial number COVID-19 \nrelated projects. Of the 23 projects committed in 2020, 12 (52%) of GEN/EGM- categorized projects) were COVID-\n19 related response projects under the public sector management (PSM) (8 projects) and health sector (4 projects).  \n ", "2 \nsituations may not be enough to address the targeted gender issues in the current COVID \nsituation. Continuous capacity development and technical guidance to executing/implementing \nagencies on the implementation, monitoring, and reporting of gender action plans (GAPs) need \nto be sustained amidst the evolving new normal.  \n \n5.  Subproject 3 will continue to support gender mainstreaming operations in Central and \nWest Asia.6 The subproject will assist projects in the integration of gender design features to meet \nGEN/EGM requirements in the current COVID context. It will determine key gender actions to \naddress gender issues specific to the project scope that are aligned with the pillar of ADB\u2019s \noperational  plan  for  gender  equality.7 To  meet  EGM  requirements,  this  will  include  the \ndevelopment of subprojects that will provide gender mainstreaming TA support to specific loan \nprojects in the difficult sectors of energy, transport, and public finance. The subproject will also \ncarry on with the activities of subprojects 1 and 2, specifically, support to the implementation of \nGAPs, collection and review of semi-annual GAP updates, and reporting on gender equality \nresults through the preparation of gender sections for project completion reports. Subproject 3 \nwill further refine the gender database that was developed under Subproject 2 and conduct \ntraining/s on populating the fields with relevant data from the GAPs of completed projects that \nalign  with  the  gender  indicators  in  the  ADB Corporate  Results  Framework,  as  well  as  on \ngenerating reports.8 The subproject will also conduct an assessment of the 3-year implementation \nof  the  TA  cluster  and  look  into  the  challenges,  lessons  learned,  and  ways  forward  in \nmainstreaming gender in ADB operations. This will include identifying potential projects for gender \nmainstreaming and other activities to be included in a future cluster TRTA. The subproject will \nsupport gender capacity building of executing and implementing agencies of ADB projects to \nenhance implementation of project GAPs and monitoring and reporting on gender equality results. \nSuch capacity building activities will include in-country workshops and a subregional workshop. \n \nB.
