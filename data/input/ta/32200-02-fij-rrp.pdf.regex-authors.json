Environmental monitoring and management plans, \nAssessment  incorporated  into  civil  works  contracts,  are  being  implemented \neffectively and are monitored by an environment officer of the \nWater and Sewerage Department (WSD). \n   \nProject Description  The Project comprises two components: \n(i)  Component  A:  provision  of  water  and  sewerage \nfacilities. \n(ii)  Component B: institutional reforms and development to \nassist the transition of the water and sewerage division \nof the Ministry of Public Utilities, Works and Transport \ninto an independent utility.  \n \nThe Project is well advanced, but is subject to cost overruns. The \nsupplementary loan will finance seven project components, which \nhave not been procured yet. \n   \nRationale  The Suva\u2013Nausori regional water supply system supplies water to \nabout 332,000 people (or 98% of the population) living within the \nSuva\u2013Nausori area. When the Project was appraised in 2003, \nconsumers throughout the service area\u2014particularly those living \nat  the  edges  of  the  water  supply  network\u2014were  subject  to \nfrequent supply disruptions, primarily because of dilapidated water \ntreatment  and  distribution  assets.  Unaccounted-for  water  was \nestimated  at  55%.  The  water  transmission  and  distribution \nsystems  required  optimization  to  improve  distribution  and \nminimize losses. \n \nMany of the Suva\u2013Nausori regional sewerage system assets were \nalso dilapidated. In central Suva, anecdotal evidence suggested \ninflow and infiltration could be as high as 90% in wet weather. \nLeaks  from  the  sewers  and  frequent  overflows  from  poorly \nmaintained  sewage  pump  stations  have  contributed  to  the \ndegradation of the aquatic ecosystems of the urban streams and \ncoastal foreshore, and pose a risk to human health. \n \nThe  institutional  arrangements  for  the  delivery  of  water  and \nsewerage services to urban centers are not conducive to a high ", "ii   \nlevel of service to consumers, and are not financially sustainable. \nThe Government\u2019s Strategic Plan, 2003\u20132005 and the Ministry of \nPublic Utilities, Works and Transport (MPUWT) corporate plan for \n2002  provided  a  framework  for  corporatization  of  water  and \nsewerage services. The framework proposed the reorganization of \nthe water and sewerage section of MPUWT into an autonomous \nwater and sewerage corporation.  \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  loan  of  $47 \nmillion from its ordinary capital resources on 8 December 2003 for \nthe  Suva\u2013Nausori  Water  Supply  and  Sewerage  Project.  In \nJanuary  2009,  the  Government  asked  ADB  to  provide \nsupplementary financing to cover anticipated cost overruns for the \nProject  caused  by  factors  beyond  the  control  of  the  interim \nGovernment,  including  rising  global  commodity  prices  and  the \ndepreciation  of  the  US  dollar  against  regional  currencies.  As \ncontracts are usually denominated in US dollars, its depreciation \nresulted in construction costs that were substantially higher than \nestimated when the Project was appraised. \n \nThe original project rationale remains valid as the provision of \nreliable and sustainable water supply and sewerage services, and \nimprovement  in  public  and  environmental  health,  are  high \npriorities of the Government and major concerns of the people of \nthe  Fiji  Islands.  The  Project  supports  the  development  policy \nobjectives  articulated  in  the  Government\u2019s  draft  Strategic \nDevelopment Plan, 2007\u20132011. The Project also supports ADB\u2019s \nWater Policy by (i) improving and expanding the delivery of water \nand sewerage services, and (ii) increasing water and sewerage \nservice efficiency and sustainability through institutional reforms. \n \nThe economic analysis of the Project has been redone and shows \nthat it remains economically viable despite the cost overruns. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project is contributing to better living standards in the Suva\u2013\nNausori Region, particularly for the urban poor. Outcomes from \nthe Project include (i) increased delivery of safe water supply and \nsewerage services in the Suva\u2013Nausori area through physical and \ninstitutional  improvements,  and  (ii)  enhanced  sustainability  of \nwater supply and sewerage services throughout the Fiji Islands \nthrough institutional reforms. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The  revised  project  cost  estimate  is  $100.12  million,  including \ntaxes and duties of $13.25 million. The project cost overrun is \nestimated to be $27.74 million, including taxes and duties of $4.65 \nmillion. \n   ", "  iii\nSupplementary  A loan of $23.0 million from the ordinary capital resources of the \nFinancing Plan  Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided under ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The \nloan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, \nan  interest rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15%, and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The loan will be provided to the Republic of the Fiji Islands. \nTerms \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Public Utilities, a division of MPUWT, will remain \nthe executing and implementing agency for the Project.  \n   \nProcurement  All procurement to be financed by the ADB loan will be carried out \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Civil works procurement will follow \ninternational competitive bidding procedures and ADB's standard \nbidding documents. \n   \nConsulting Services  Four separate consulting services contracts will be financed under \nthe supplementary loan to assist the Government to: (i) implement \nthe water loss reduction program; (ii) implement the leak detection \ntraining  program;  (iii)  implement  the  environmental  monitoring \nprogram; and (iv) technical support to the project management \nunit.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  a  firm  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time) using quality- and cost-\nbased selection procedures with a quality and cost ratio of 80:20. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project\u2019s  water  supply  component  will  help  reduce  health \nBeneficiaries  risks, such as infantile diarrhea, caused by the lack of water and \ncontamination of water arising from low pressure in the piped \nsystem.  It  will  also  provide  water  for  cooking,  washing,  and \nbathing,  and  reduce  the  need  to  boil  water.  Improvements  in \nsewage disposal will help prevent contamination of waterways, \nbenefiting  the  poorest  people  who  live  in  swampy,  low-lying, \npoorly  draining  areas  near  the  coast.  Residents  of  these \ncommunities  use  urban  streams  and  the  coastal  foreshore  for \nfishing and supplementing their food sources. The environmental \nbenefits of the Project\u2019s sewerage component will improve the \nquality of life of the poorest people. Because of the global financial \ncrisis  and  recent  political  events  in  the  Fiji  Islands,  more \nhouseholds in the Suva\u2013Nausori area are facing hardship. \n \nThe economic analyses on the project components were redone \nto  include  the  cost  overruns.  The  economic  analyses  yield \neconomic internal rates of return of 14.5% for the water supply \n ", "iv   \ncomponent  and  12.7%  for  the  sewerage  component.  The \nestimated economic internal rate of return for the two components \ncombined is 13.8%.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  Institutional  reforms.  The  Water  Authority  Fiji  (WAF)  is \nscheduled to begin operations on 1 January 2010. A number of \ncrucial actions are required to ensure that the transition from the \nWSD to WAF is effective. Transfer of personnel from WSD to \nWAF started on 1 September 2009. However, the WAF staffing \nstructure and identification staff units and records currently within \nWSD  and  MPUWT  to  be  transferred  to  WAF  have  not  been \ncompleted. Time-bound assurances have been incorporated into \nthe supplementary loan agreement to ensure that these tasks are \ncompleted before WAF begins operation as a fully functioning \nautonomous water and sewerage corporation. \n \nFurther project delays and cost increases. Further delays and \nproject cost increases are not expected as the majority of the \nworks have been awarded.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsupplementary loan to the Republic of the Fiji Islands for the Suva\u2013Nausori Water Supply and \nSewerage Project. \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n2.  The Government of the Fiji Islands in March 2000 requested a loan from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to finance the Suva\u2013Nausori Water Supply and Sewerage Project. 1 \nThe request followed implementation of a technical assistance (TA) project for the preparation \nof a comprehensive water supply and sewerage master plan and a feasibility study of high-\npriority investments identified in the plan.2 The ADB Board of Directors approved a loan for $47 \nmillion on 18 December 2003. Approval of the loan was delayed following the coup of May \n2000. The Project is the first phase of a longer-term water supply and sewerage improvement \nstrategy. The Loan Agreement was signed on 5 August 2004 and the loan became effective on \n8 December 2004. \n \n3.  In January 2009, the Government asked ADB to provide supplementary financing to \ncover anticipated cost overruns caused by factors beyond the control of the interim Government, \nincluding rising global commodity prices and the depreciation of the US dollar against regional \ncurrencies.  As  contracts  are  usually  denominated  in  US  dollars,  its  depreciation  resulted  in \nconstruction costs that were substantially higher than estimated when the Project was appraised. \nIf the Project is not completed, it will not deliver the intended benefits to the poor\u2014improved \naccess to water and sanitation services. This would have consequences for (i) the Fiji Islands, in \nterms of worsening poverty; and (ii) ADB, in terms of reputation risk associated with failing to \nreach desired development outputs and outcomes. \n \nIII.  THE APPROVED PROJECT \nA.  Project Rationale \n4.  The Suva\u2013Nausori regional water supply system supplies water to about 332,000 people \n(or 98% of the population) living within the Suva\u2013Nausori area. When the Project was appraised \nin 2003, consumers throughout the service area\u2014particularly those living at the edges of the \nwater supply network\u2014were subject to frequent water supply disruptions, primarily because of \npump equipment failure and burst water supply mains. The water supply network was and \nremains subject to substantial losses. Unaccounted-for water is estimated at 55%. The area's \ntwo water treatment plants at Tamavua and Waila required rehabilitation to improve the quality \nand  quantity  of  treated  water.  The  water  transmission  and  distribution  systems  required \noptimization  to  distribute  the  produced  water  better  to service  areas  in  relation  to  relative \ndemand for water. \n \n5.  The wastewater collection and treatment system faces similar issues. In central Suva, \nanecdotal evidence suggested inflow and infiltration accounted for up to 90% of the sewer flows \nduring wet weather. High tide also resulted in higher flows and salinity levels within the sewer \nsystem, which reduced the efficiency of the area's sewage treatment plants and substantially \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003.

Manila (TA 3055-FIJ, approved 18 August, for $800,000). ", "2 \nincreased the costs of conveying sewage to the plants. Pipes subject to inflow and infiltration \nare  also  subject  to  exfiltration  (leakage  of  sewage  into  the  environment).  Exfiltration  and \nfrequent overflows resulted from poorly maintained sewage pump stations, and blocked and \ndilapidated sewer mains. This has contributed to the degradation of the aquatic ecosystems of \nthe urban streams and coastal foreshore, and poses a risk to human health. Rehabilitation of \nsewerage assets will enable the current system to deliver environmental and public health \nbenefits. It will also facilitate the connection of a larger percentage of the population to the \nsystem, further improving the environment and utilizing the available treatment capacity of the \nKinoya sewage treatment plant, the area's main sewage treatment plant. The Kinoya plant, \nwhich includes a trickling filter process for secondary treatment and a sequencing batch reactor, \ngenerally  operates  effectively  and  achieves  international  wastewater  discharge  quality \nstandards. However, its capacity is limited by the inlet works, and odor control is a problem. \nSludge treatment and disposal facilities are inadequate. Better instrumentation of the sewage \ntreatment plant will enable treatment efficiency improvements and efficient balancing between \nthe trickling filter and sequencing batch reactor plant. \n \n6.  When the Project was appraised, the institutional arrangements for the delivery of water \nand sewerage services to urban centers were not conducive to a high level of service to \nconsumers, and were not financially sustainable. The Water and Sewerage Department (WSD), \na division of the Ministry of Public Utilities, Works and Transport (MPUWT), was responsible for \nthe planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of urban water supplies and \nsewerage  systems.  MPUWT  senior  staff  were  responsible  not  only  for  water  supply  and \nsewerage,  but  also  roads,  buildings,  and  mechanical  and  electrical  works.  Management \ninformation systems focused more on capital works than on operations or finances. \n \n7.  The Government\u2019s Strategic Plan, 2003\u20132005 and the MPUWT (then known as the \nMinistry of Works and Energy) corporate plan for 2002 provided a framework for corporatization \nof water and sewerage services.3 The framework proposed the reorganization of the water and \nsewerage  section  of  MPUWT  into  an  autonomous  water  and  sewerage  corporation.  The \nGovernment  and  MPUWT  staff  recognized  the  need  to  plan  carefully  for  the  transition  to \nmaintain the high level of accessibility to services, avoid harmful impacts on the poor, retrain \nand  redeploy  staff  rather  than  terminate  them,  and  avoid  substantial  tariff  increases  until \nservices can be improved. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n8.  The  Project  will  contribute  to  higher  living  standards  in  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  area, \nparticularly for the urban poor. The objectives of the Project are to (i) increase the delivery of \nsafe water supply and sewerage services to the Suva\u2013Nausori area through physical and \ninstitutional improvements, and (ii) enhance the sustainability of water supply and sewerage \nservices throughout the Fiji Islands through appropriate institutional reforms. \n \n9.  The Project\u2019s outputs include (i) increased supply, delivery, and reliability of potable \nwater  in  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  area;  (ii)  reduced  unaccounted-for  water;  (iii)  a  rehabilitated \nwastewater collection and treatment system; (iv) recovery of aquatic ecosystems that have \ndegraded  because  of  inadequate  sewerage  services;  (v)  strengthened  institutions  and \nlegislative frameworks for wastewater management and environmental management; and (vi) \nestablishment of an entity dedicated to the provision of water and sewerage services in metered \nwater supply areas, operated in manner similar to those of a commercial water supply and \n                                                 \n3   Government of Fiji Islands. 2002.

On 18 December 2003, ADB approved a loan of $47 million for the Project from its \nordinary  capital  resources,  under  its  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility. The loan has a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.75% on the undisbursed loan amount; and a front-end fee of 0.5%. \n \n16.  When the loan was approved, the Fiji Islands was classified as a group C country and \nwas eligible to receive ADB financing for up to 65% financing of the project cost. An amended \ncost-sharing ceiling and financing parameters for the country were approved on 20 July 2009, \nwhich raised ADB's cost-sharing ceiling to 99% for costs in relation to loans, grants, and TA. \nThe Government is providing counterpart funding of $25.4 million for the Project. ADB funding \nincludes $45.9 million for foreign exchange costs and the equivalent of $1.1 million for local \ncurrency costs.

Status of Project Implementation Progress \n17.  Of the 25 project components originally identified in the Loan Agreement, nine have \nbeen completed: a consultancy to support institutional reform, seven water supply civil works \ncontracts, and a leak detection and repair program executed by the Government under force \naccount procedures. A chronology of project events is in Appendix 2. \n \n18.  Component A: Water Supply and Sewerage. Outputs delivered under this component \ninclude (i) construction of 60.5 km of new water supply mains, including 11.0 km of raw water \nmains from water sources; (ii) replacement of 56 km of undersized or dilapidated mains; (iii) \nconstruction of 12 new service and system balance reservoirs with a combined capacity of 18.6 \nmillion liters; and (iv) construction and commissioning of four new water supply pump stations. \nThese outputs have improved the delivery of water supply services through better reliability, \nparticularly to areas within the Suva\u2013Nausori water supply network, which had been subject to \nchronic water supply disruptions. 5  \n \n19.  Ongoing component A works include three contracts and force account works, which will \ndeliver 6 km of trunk sewers, rehabilitate five major sewage pump stations, and upgrade about \n60 minor sewage pump stations. Bids for civil works contracts to rehabilitate and augment the \nWaila and Tamavua water treatment plants, and rehabilitate and augment the Kinoya sewage \ntreatment plant, are being evaluated. The contracts are expected to be awarded by October \n2009. Bidding for the rehabilitation of sewers in the Suva central business district and Nausori \ntown, and rehabilitation of the Great Eastern Sewer, closed on 15 September 2009. A contract \nis expected to be awarded by 27 November 2009. Bidding for the five remaining water supply \nand sewerage contracts is scheduled to be completed by February 2010. \n                                                 \n5   A notable example of improved water supply service delivery, which may be directly attributed to the Project, is \nthe provision of uninterrupted water supplies to more than 20,000 residents of Tacirua, Nagatugatu, Sekoca, and \nCunningham. These residents had been subject to daily water supply disruptions before the Project. \n ", "6 \n \n20.  Component B: Institutional Reform and Development. The institutional reform of the \nFiji Islands' water and sewerage sector is ongoing. A consultancy to assist the Government in \ndesigning and implementing the institutional reform action plan to corporatize the Government's \nwater and sewerage services was completed in December 2006. Outputs from the consultancy \nincluded (i) development of an organizational structure and human resources development plan, \n(ii) design and development of a management information system, (iii) an update of a customer \ndatabase and water meter verification, (iv) development of a customer relations management \nplan, (v) design and development of a financial management system, (vi) preparation of an \ninfrastructure asset management plan, (vii) preparation of legislation to enable corporatization of \nthe WSD, and (viii) preparation of a corporate plan for a corporatized water and sewerage \nentity. \n \n21.  A number of milestones in the reform of WSD have been reached, including (i) the \ndeclaration of WSD as a reform enterprise in accordance with the Public Enterprises Act, 1996 \nin June 2006; (ii) appointment of a charter change committee in September 2006; (iii) Cabinet \napproval of the reorganization charter of WSD in October 2006; (iv) promulgation of the Fiji \nWater Authority Act in August 2007; (v) formation of the Water Authority Fiji (WAF) in 2008; (vi) \nappointment of the WAF board of directors in February 2009; and (vii) appointment of the WAF \nchief executive officer in May 2009. The Government complied with the time-bound institutional \nreform and development covenants which were included in the approved Loan Agreement.6 \nHowever,  compliance  was  delayed  by  up  to  12  months.  In  June  2009,  WAF  and  the \nGovernment agreed to amend the proposed staffing structure and arrangements for transfer of \nstaff units, staff assets, and records from WSD to WAF. Transfer of personnel from WSD to \nWAF commenced on 1 September 2009 prior to the finalization of the WAF staffing structure \nand the arrangements for transfer of WSD staff units, staff assets, and records to WAF which \nare expected to be completed by 31 December 2009. Rapid completion of these activities is \ncrucial  as  WAF  is  scheduled  to  commence  operations  as  a  fully  autonomous  water  and \nsewerage corporation on 1 January 2010. \n \n22.  WAF is preparing an updated staffing plan, and a corporate plan and strategy. It is also \nreviewing tariffs for water and sewerage. All of these are scheduled to be completed by 31 \nDecember 2009. The changes to the tariff structure will be effective from 1 January 2010. The \nGovernment will support WAF financially through its annual budgetary process for 3 years \nbeginning  in  FY2010.  The  Government  has  complied  with  the  institutional  reform  and \ndevelopment covenants of the loan. However, compliance with some time-bound covenants \nwas delayed by up to 12 months as result as delays in the loan becoming effective (about 12 \nmonths)  and  delays  in  recruiting  consultants  to  assist  the  Government  in  designing  and \nimplementing the reforms. \n \n23.  Project Management. MPU is the executing agency, and WSD is the implementing \nagency for the Project. Two project management units (PMUs) were established within WSD, \none for component A and the other for component B. The PMU for component B has been \n                                                 \n6   Time-bound institutional reform and development covenants in the approved Loan Agreement included: (i) \nappointment of WSD's advisory Board by 30 June 2004; (ii) Development of a staffing plan for WSD including \nposition descriptions for all senior staff by 1 July 2004; (iii) All senior staff within WSD to be employed under \nperformance-based contracts issued by the Public Service Commission by 1 July 2004; (iv) Staff units, staff \nassets, and records currently within PWD relating to WSD to be transferred to WSD by 30 September 2004; (v) a \nmemorandum outlining the progress of institutional reforms and the next steps required for corporatization of \nWSD to be submitted to the Cabinet by 30 June 2004; and (vi) Cabinet consideration of a memorandum \npresenting for approval the draft Charter Organization Plan, outline chart of accounts, proposed management \ninformation system, and proposed financing and regulatory arrangements for the corporatized entity. \n ", "7 \ndisbanded  as  many  of  the  institutional  reform  components  are  complete.  The  PMU  for \ncomponent A, which reports to the permanent secretary for public utilities, is responsible for \nimplementation, programming, selection and engagement of consultants, procurement of goods \nand services, management of construction, maintenance of project records, progress reporting, \nfinancial management, identification of problems and issues that arise during implementation, \nstaff training, and preparation of recommendations for adjustments in the Project.  \n \n24.  The  PMU  for  component  A  is  headed  by  a  project  manager  appointed  by  the \nGovernment. The PMU also includes a leak detection engineer, a project accountant, and a \ntechnical officer seconded to the PMU from WSD. WSD provides the services of a senior valuer, \na land acquisition officer, and a community relations officer, as required. The structure of the \nPMU, as approved by the Public Service Commission, includes a senior water engineer and a \nsenior sewer engineer. However, the Government has been unable to recruit individuals for \nthese posts because of the chronic shortage of engineers in the Fiji Islands. As a result, the \nPMU has limited technical capacity. Design and supervision consultants report to the project \nmanager. \n \n25.  A project steering committee was constituted from among the members of the capital \nworks committee, which was established during the preparation of the master plan for the \ndevelopment of water and sewerage services in the Suva\u2013Nausori area. The committee has \nbeen disbanded, and the WAF board now provides guidance and direction for the Project. \n \n26.  Implementation  Period. Project implementation is delayed by about 24 months. At \nappraisal, the Project was envisaged to be implemented over 5 years, starting in April 2004. The \nProject began in December 2004 with the appointment of the PMUs for components A and B. \nThe Loan Agreement specified a project completion date of 31 December 2008. The loan \nclosing date was later extended to 31 December 2010. The implementation delay was caused \nby (i) a 12-month delay in recruiting the component B PMU, a condition for loan effectiveness; \nand (ii) limited management capacity within the component A PMU from November 2005 until \nMarch  2007  following  the  appointment  of  a  new  project  manager  with  limited  project \nmanagement experience.7 \n \n27.  Procurement. Procurement of some project components is complete. Bidding for the \ncontracts  followed  international  competitive  bidding  methods  using  standard  ADB  bid \ndocuments.  As  of  11 September  2009,  ADB  had  approved  $28.42  million in  financing for \nawarded contracts. \n \n28.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting. The PMU is responsible for preparing quarterly \nprogress reports on project implementation, and for maintaining separate accounts and records \nof expenditures for the Project. Externally audited project accounts and financial statements are \nsubmitted to ADB annually. The MPUWT has been unable to provide ADB with the quarterly \nprogress reports since the third quarter of 2005, but it has provided ADB with updated project \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  data  quarterly.  The  submission  of  the  FY2006  audited  project \naccounts to ADB was delayed by 14 months, resulting in the suspension of the loan for about 6 \nweeks in early 2008. The submission of the FY2006 audited project accounts was delayed \nbecause the MPUWT and the Ministry of Finance needed to reconcile differences in recorded \nproject expenditures. The Ministry of Finance adopted a new cost coding system in 2005, which \nwas not fully adopted by the MPUWT until 2006. This resulted in mismatched expenditures \n                                                 \n7   A new project manager was appointed in November 2005 following the resignation of the original project \nmanager. The second project manager was replaced by the current project manager in March 2007. Project \nimplementation progress improved significantly following the replacement of the second project manager. \n ", "8 \nrecorded by the two ministries, and required about 12 months to resolve. The FY2007 audited \nproject accounts were submitted to ADB before the due date, and the submission of the FY2008 \naudited project accounts is anticipated by the due date (30 September 2009). All of the audited \nproject accounts submitted to date have been cleared. \n \n29.  Related Technical Assistance. A TA grant for the Capacity Building in Water and \nSewerage  Services  project  was  approved  with  the  original  loan.8 The  MPUWT  was  the \nexecuting agency and implementing agency for the TA. The TA provided 37.4 person-months of \ninternational consultant inputs and 40.5 person-months of national consultant inputs. Completed \nin  2006,  the  TA  supported  the  development  of  a  trade  waste  program,  health  and  safety \nprocedures, environmental legislation and regulations, a community education and awareness \nprogram, and a tariff study. WSD has implemented the trade waste program and the health and \nsafety procedures. The environmental legislation and regulations were promulgated in 2006. \nCommunity  awareness  and  education  programs  by  WSD  are  being  implemented  by  its \ncommunity liaison officer. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Cost Overrun \n \n30.  The estimated cost to implement the Project has risen significantly primarily because the \ncost of materials and fuel has increased and the US dollar has weakened against the currencies \nof bidders for major contracts. Investment costs for the Project are now estimated at $114.2 \nmillion, compared with $72.4 million at appraisal. Wage increases and an underestimation of \nproject costs at appraisal also contributed to the cost overruns.  \n \n31.  An analysis was undertaken to estimate the impact of rising material prices, a weaker \nUS dollar, and wage increases on the prices for the contracts that have already been bid.9 The \ncumulative value of the bids is $52.3 million, compared with the appraisal cost estimate of $30.4 \nmillion for those contracts, a cost overrun of $21.9 million (71.7%). Material cost increases were \nestimated to account for $12.6 million (57.8%) of the cost overrun, depreciation of the US dollar \nagainst  the  currencies  of  the  bidders  accounted  for  $4.7  million  (21.6%),  wage  increases \naccounted for $1.3 million (5.8%), and underestimation of construction costs at project appraisal \naccounted for $3.2 million (14.8%). The summary results of the cost overrun analysis are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n32.  The design of the major components that have not been bid are complete. The cost \nestimates for these components take into account the current construction market conditions \nwithin the Fiji Islands, as well as in Australia and New Zealand where most of the specialist \nequipment, materials, and personnel will be sourced. With advance procurement action to \nsupport timely implementation of the remaining components, prices are expected to remain at \nestimated costs. \n \nB.  Impact on the Project \n \n33.  Because  of  the  estimated  cost  overruns,  the  approved  financing  for  the  Project  is \ninsufficient to achieve the original objectives and outputs. In light of the potential cost overruns, \nthe  Government  reassessed  the  project  priorities  and  decided,  where  possible  without \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2003.

Project components that \nwere shelved included the Rewa run-of-the-river component, the extension of the sewerage \nnetwork to service the proposed Housing Authority development at Navitoka, the development \nof an asset register and geographic information system, and the purchase of computers and \nequipment for the National Water Quality Laboratory and the National Pump Workshop. The \nbasis for shelving these components is in Appendix 4. With the reduced scope, the cost to \nimplement the Project is estimated at $100.1 million, a cost overrun of $27.7 million. \n \n34.  The following components are considered essential to attaining the project goals and \nhave not yet been procured: \n(i)  rehabilitation  and  augmentation  of  the  Waila  and  Tamavua  water  treatment \nplants; \n(ii)  construction of backwash treatment and sludge disposal facilities at the Waila \nand Tamavua water treatment plants; \n(iii)  water loss reduction program; \n(iv)  rehabilitation and augmentation of the Kinoya sewage treatment plant; \n(v)  leak  detection  training,  including  provision  of  specialized  leak  detection \nequipment; \n(vi)  rehabilitation of sewers in Suva central business district, Nausori Town, and the \nGreat Eastern Sewer; \n(vii)  backlog sewerage program; \n(viii)  environmental monitoring program; and \n(ix)  PMU technical support consultants. \n \n35.  The rehabilitation and augmentation of the Waila and Tamavua water treatment plants \nand the rehabilitation and augmentation of the Kinoya sewage treatment plant are expected to \nbe awarded during the fourth quarter of 2009. ADB will finance eligible expenditures from these \ncontracts from the remaining uncommitted funds under the original loan (about $13.8 million). \nThe cost of the remaining seven essential project components that have not been procured \n(para. 34) is estimated at $30.50 million. To help meet the cost overrun, the Government has \nrequested a supplementary loan from ADB for $23.00 million. The Government will contribute \n$4.74  million  in  additional  counterpart  funding  and  $2.76  million  from  counterpart  funding \nsavings identified in the original loan (primarily from design and supervision consultant cost \nsavings). \n \nC.  Lessons \n \n36.  Cost Estimates. A number of lessons are evident from ADB support for infrastructure \ndevelopment projects in the Fiji Islands and elsewhere in the Pacific. The Fiji Islands relies on \ninternational markets, particularly New Zealand and Australia, for civil works contracts. The \npreparation of accurate cost estimates is difficult as external factors that are hard to gauge often \ndirectly affect costs in the Fiji Islands. Physical contingencies must be sufficient to allow for \ntechnical  uncertainties.  In  addition,  the  selection  of  procurement  methods  must  take  into \naccount the capacity of implementing agencies to manage and coordinate contracts, and their \nability to attract sufficient qualified bidders. \n \n37.  Implementation  Delays.  Cost  overruns  have  historically  been  related  to  delays  in \nimplementation, mainly caused by technical and procurement issues. The risk of delays in \nproject  implementation  and  associated  cost  overruns  need  to  be  identified  during  project \npreparation. The preparation of bid documents during project preparation will reduce the risk of \nimplementation delays.  \n \n ", "10 \nD.  Rationale \n \n38.  The original project rationale remains valid as the provision of reliable and sustainable \nwater supply and sewerage services, and improvement in public and environmental health, are \nhigh priorities of the Government and major concerns of the people of the Fiji Islands. The \nProject supports the objectives articulated in the Government\u2019s draft Strategic Development Plan, \n2007\u20132011 for the development of efficient and cost-effective infrastructure, which will facilitate \neconomic  and  social  development  and  spur  private  sector  investment,  accompanied  by \ninstitutional improvements to increase the efficiency and raise the standards of facilities and \nservices. The goals of the plan for water and sanitation services are the provision of reliable and \nadequate  supplies  of  safe  water  in  both  urban  and  rural  centers  and  to  sanitary  and \nenvironmentally safe sewerage waste systems and treatment facilities. Strategies to achieve \nthese goals include (i) upgrading of major urban and regional water schemes; (ii) expansion of \nsewer  reticulation  mains  and  treatment  plant  facilities,  and  promotion  of  environmental \npreservation; (iii) private sector participation in the development and operation of water and \nsewerage services; (iv) aggressive leak detection programs; and (v) preparation and promulgation \nof legislation to enable reform of the water sector. \n \n39.  The Project also supports ADB\u2019s Water Policy10 by (i) improving and expanding the \ndelivery  of  water  and  sewerage  services,  and  (ii)  increasing  water  and  sewerage  service \nefficiency and sustainability through the transfer of water and sewerage services from WSD to \nWAF,  the  introduction of  appropriate  tariffs  that  will  enable  the  recovery  of  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) costs, the provision of enhanced maintenance programs to be developed \nand implemented, thereby improving the sustainability of water supply and sewerage assets, \nand increased public awareness. \n \n40.  The economic analysis of the Project has been redone and shows that the Project \nremains economically viable despite the cost overruns and reduced scope. The rehabilitation \nand  augmentation  of  water  supply  and  sewerage  services  in  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  area  are \nessential to improve the reliability, security, and quality of the services delivered to the area's \npopulation. To address the erosion of the skills base for provision of public water supply and \nsewerage services in the Fiji Islands, the Government and WAF are recruiting key technical and \nmanagerial personnel locally and abroad. \n \n41.  The Project is eligible for supplementary financing under ADB\u2019s policy criteria as \n(i)  the Project is identified as a high-priority activity under the Government\u2019s draft \nStrategic Development Plan, 2007\u20132011; \n(ii)  supplementary financing will help achieve the project objectives and benefits; \n(iii)  supplementary financing was not previously provided;  \n(iv)  the Project is in an advanced state of implementation and can be completed \nquickly; and \n(v)  the amount of supplementary financing will not exceed the original financing \napproved by ADB. \n \nE.  ADB\u2019s Reengagement Strategy \n \n42.  Following the political crisis in 2006, ADB is implementing a two-stage reengagement \nstrategy  in  the  Fiji  Islands.11 In  the  first  stage,  ADB  has  continued  to  support  ongoing \noperations, as it has ascertained that the interim Government (i) effectively controls the country, \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n ", "11 \n(ii) generally recognizes the country\u2019s international obligations, (iii) is willing and able to assume \nall of its predecessor\u2019s obligations to ADB, (iv) can ensure the continued implementation of \nongoing projects and programs, and (v) has authorized a representative to make withdrawals.  \n \n43.  ADB  has  not  yet  proposed  a  resumption  of  formal  discussions  on  a  new  country \npartnership strategy, or a new loan or TA. A proposal to resume full operations in the Fiji \nIslands\u2014the second stage of the reengagement strategy\u2014will be made once the evidence \ndemonstrates that the conditions are appropriate. The Pacific Department will regularly assess \nthe conditions for new engagement. Poverty reduction is a key consideration in defining new \nlending and nonlending priorities. The Suva\u2013Nausori Water Supply and Sewerage Project is \nincluded in ADB\u2019s approved and ongoing program, and it needs supplementary financing to \nreach completion. \n \nF.  Revised Cost Estimates \n \n44.  The revised investment cost to implement the Project with a reduced scope is estimated \nat $100.12 million, including taxes and duties of $13.22 million.12 Financing charges during \nimplementation are estimated at $5.12 million. The revised cost estimates are summarized in \nTable 3; details are in Appendix 5. \n \nTable 3: Revised Cost Estimates \n($ million)\n \nItem     Amounts \n       \nA.  Base Costa   \n  1.

Revised Financing Plan \n \n45.  The Government has requested a loan of $23.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15%, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Government has provided ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the \nbasis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \nTable 4: Revised Financing Plan \n($ million) \n Financing Source  Amount   Percentagea \nAsian Development Bank   23.00  82.91 \nGovernment of the Fiji Islands  4.74  17.09 \nTotal   27.74  100.00 \na  The Asian Development Bank approved a country cost-sharing ceiling of up to 99% on 20 July 2009. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nH.  Remedial Steps \n \n46.  Bidding documents have been prepared for all major civil works components proposed \nfor financing under the supplementary loan. Bids for the rehabilitation of the Waila and Tamavua \nwater treatment plants and the rehabilitation of the Kinoya sewage treatment plant are being \nevaluated. Contracts are expected to be awarded by 31 August 2009. Retroactive financing of \nthe PMU technical support consultants; the backlog sewerage program; and the rehabilitation of \nsewers in Suva central business district, Nausori Town, and the Great Eastern Sewer (contract \nWSC  41/04)  will  enable  bidding  and  the  award  of  contracts  before  the  approval  of  the \nsupplementary loan. This will expedite project implementation. \n \nI.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n47.  The  existing  implementation  arrangements  for  the  Project  in  terms  of  accounting, \nauditing, reporting, and performance monitoring and evaluation are considered adequate and \nwill not be changed. Project review missions will continue to be undertaken every 6 months. The \nMPUWT will provide ADB with a completion report within 3 months of the physical completion of \nthe Project. \n \na.  Project Management  \n48.  MPU will remain the project executing and implementing agency. The recently appointed \nWAF board will provide guidance and direction on project activities, as the responsibility for \ndelivery of urban water supply and sewerage services will be transferred from the WSD to WAF \non 1 January 2010.13 The PMU will remain within the MPU and will report to the permanent \nsecretary for public utilities. The PMU will continue to coordinate project activities; monitor \noverall project progress; and manage project accounts, procurement, and reporting. To address \n                                                 \n13 Under the Public Enterprises Act 1996, the minister for public enterprise, after consulting with the relevant minister \n(in the case of WAF, the minister for public utilities, works and transport) and with the approval of the Prime \nMinister, appoints members of reform enterprise boards. The minister for public enterprises is also responsible for \nthe designation of the chairperson of the board from among members of the board.  \n \n ", "13 \nproject implementation capacity issues within the PMU, the Government is currently recruiting a \nsenior water supply engineer and a senior sewerage engineer. \n \nb.  Implementation Period \n49.   The Project completion date will be extended from 31 December 2010 to 30 June 2012 \nto allow for the completion of all project components and to enable the Project to achieve its \nobjectives. The revised implementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \nc.  Procurement \n50.   All procurement to be financed by ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Civil works will be procured \nfollowing international competitive bidding procedures and ADB's standard bid documents. Bid \ndocuments for all civil works contracts will be reviewed and endorsed by ADB prior to bidding. \nBid evaluation reports will be reviewed within ADB by the Pacific Department and the Central \nOperations Services Office and / or the Procurement Committee prior to award of the Contract. \nThe revised procurement plan is in Appendix 7. \n \nd.  Anticorruption Policy \n51.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MPU.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n52.  In  addition  to  the  standard  ADB  requirements,  to  deter  corruption  and  increase \ntransparency, the Project will (i) build the EA\u2019s capacity to comply with ADB and Government \nprocedures, to be outlined in an updated project administration manual; and (ii) establish a \nproject  website  to  disclose  information  concerning  the  Project,  including  general  project \ninformation, procurement, project progress, and contact details in the English, Fijian, and Hindi \nlanguages. The website will also provide a link to a mechanism for reporting grievances relating \nto the Project and project activities. With regard to procurement, the website shall include \ninformation on the list of participating bidders, name of the winning bidder, basic details on \nbidding procedures adopted, amount of contract awarded, and the list of goods and works \nprocured. \n \ne.  Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n53.  To facilitate timely project implementation, ADB approved advance procurement action \nand retroactive financing of three contracts: (i) the PMU technical support consultants; (ii) the \nbacklog  sewerage  program;  and  (iii)  the  rehabilitation  of  sewers  in  Suva  central  business \ndistrict, Nausori Town, and the Great Eastern Sewer. Procurement for these three contracts will \nbe in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Up to 20% of loan proceeds are eligible \nfor retroactive financing. Retroactive financing is applicable to eligible expenditures, which must \nbe incurred before loan effectiveness, but not earlier than 12 months before signing of the \n ", "14 \nfinancing agreement. The Government was advised that approval of advance procurement \naction and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \nf.  Consulting Services \n54.   Four consulting services contracts will be financed under the supplementary loan to \nassist the Government to (i) implement the water loss reduction program, (ii) implement the leak \ndetection  training  program,  (iii)  implement  the  environmental  monitoring  program,  and  (iv) \nprovide  technical support  to  the PMU.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  a  firm  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) using quality- and cost-based selection procedures with a quality and cost ratio of 80:20 \nand  the  technical  proposal  types  specified  in  the  revised  procurement  plan  and  contract \npackages (Appendix 7). \n \ng.  Disbursement Arrangements \n55.   The  supplementary  loan  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Direct  payment  or \nreimbursement procedures will apply for all contracts financed by the supplementary loan. \n \nh.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n56.  The PMU will maintain separate records and accounts for project components financed \nthrough the approved loan and supplementary financing. Independent auditors acceptable to \nADB will annually conduct separate audits of the project accounts and financial statements for \ncomponents  financed  under  the  approved  loan  and  the  supplementary  financing.  The \nGovernment  will  provide  ADB  with  copies  of  the  audited  project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements for both the approved loan and supplementary financing no later than 6 months after \nthe end of the fiscal year to which they relate. The Government will provide ADB with quarterly \nprogress reports on project implementation. Within 3 months of physical completion of the \nProject, the Ministry of Finance will provide ADB with a project completion report. The PMU will \ncompile progress reports. \n \ni.  Project Performance Management System \n57.  The existing project performance management system will be retained, and quarterly \nmonitoring of indicators that are currently being monitored under the Project will continue. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n58.  The economic analyses were redone for the Project. In the absence of investments in \nthe Project, the status quo was assumed to continue. Quantified benefits for the Project's water \nsupply components included (i) non-incremental benefits comprising (a) cost savings in meeting \nthe demand of new customers at present satisfied demand levels, and (b) integration of the \nsmall water supply system servicing Colo-I-Suva into the Suva\u2013Nausori regional water supply \nscheme;  and  (ii)  incremental  benefits  comprising  (a)  meeting  suppressed  domestic  and \ncommercial demands, and (ii) non-revenue water consumed under the Project. As a result of \nlow water supply pressure to some consumers and frequent water supply disruptions, supplies \nare assumed to have constrained demand. \n \n ", "15 \n59.  Quantified benefits of the Project's sewerage components include the avoided costs of \n(i) replacing and desludging septic tanks for the 9,300 urban allotments that will be connected to \nthe sewerage system under the Project, and enforcement of laws compelling property owners to \nconnect to sewerage systems where available; and (ii) replacing the Kinoya sewage treatment \nplant and existing sewers, which would be required in the absence of the Project's rehabilitation \nand augmentation works for the plant and rehabilitation of key sewers. \n \n60.  The  economic  analyses  were  conducted  for  a  period  of  40  years,  including  an \ninvestment  period  of  9  years.  Taxes  and  duties  were  excluded  from  all  costs.  Economic \ninvestment costs included the updated cost estimates of the project components. The economic \nanalyses yielded economic internal rates of return of 14.5% for the water supply component and \n12.7% for the sewerage component. The estimated economic internal rate of return for the \nwater supply and sewerage components combined was 13.8%. The rates of return were less \nthan the assumed economic opportunity cost of capital of 12% with respect to changes in some \nkey assumptions and risks. Risk of further delays and cost increases is considered small as \nimplementation  is  advanced.  Sustainability  throughout  the  life  of  the  Project  is  supported \nthrough the tariff mechanisms. Details of the economic analyses are in Appendix 8. \n \nB.  Financial Aspects \n61.  An assessment of the cost-recovery and user charges was undertaken to ensure that \nthe Project's water supply and sewerage components are sustainable.  \n \n62.  Water Supply. Cost recovery from beneficiaries will be achieved through a revised tariff \nstructure. The tariff will be set based on metered water consumption. A block tariff structure will \nbe applied for domestic consumers for each 3-month billing cycle. A lifeline block will be applied \nfor the first 50,000 liters consumed, followed by an intermediate block applied for consumption \nbetween 50,000 and 100,000 liters, and a high block for consumption exceeding 100,000 liters \nper billing cycle. A single volumetric tariff will apply to commercial and government consumers.  \n \n63.  Sewerage. Cost recovery from beneficiaries will be achieved through the application of a \nsewerage tariff for those connected to the sewerage system. The tariff will be set based on \nmetered water consumption and applied by WAF as a separate line item on customers\u2019 water \nbills. \n \n64.  At a minimum, the water and sewerage tariffs will be set to cover the costs of O&M and \nmanagement during the first year of the revised tariff structure. It will be increased annually over \n2  years  to  achieve  full  recovery  of  O&M  costs,  depreciation,  and  debt  servicing.  The \nGovernment will fund any gap between actual tariffs and those required to achieve full cost \nrecovery.14 Details  of  the  analysis  of  cost-recovery  mechanisms  and  user  charges  are  in \nAppendix 8. \n \nC.  Social and Resettlement Impacts \n65.   A social analysis undertaken during project preparation concluded that the Project will \nhave a positive social impact. The Project\u2019s water supply component will help reduce health \nrisks, such as infantile diarrhea, that are caused by the lack of water and contamination of water \narising from low pressure in the piped system. It will also provide water for cooking, washing, \nand bathing, and reduce the need to boil water. Improvements in sewage disposal to prevent \n                                                 \n14   The Government has agreed to cover the shortfall between revenue and costs for the first 3 years of WAF \noperation, starting on 1 January 2010. \n ", "16 \ncontamination of waterways will benefit the poorest people who live in swampy, low-lying, poorly \ndraining areas near the coast, such as in Vatuwaqa and along the Samabula River. Residents \nof these communities use the waterways for fishing and supplementing their food sources. The \nenvironmental benefits of the Project\u2019s sewerage component will improve the quality of life for \nthe poorest people. Because of the current global financial crisis and the recent political events, \nmore households within the Suva\u2013Nausori area are facing hardship. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9. \n \n66.   Lack of water places an extra burden on women and children by making the collection \nand storage of water more difficult. Intermittent cuts in the water supply inconvenience women \nthe most. In both indigenous Fijian and Indo-Fijian cultures, women have prime responsibility for \nwater and sanitation at home. They are the primary caregivers of children, and they have control \nover food preparation, bathing, toileting, and hygiene of children. Thus, the Project will have a \nsignificant effect on women in terms of improving environmental conditions, the water supply, \nand family health conditions. The community education and awareness program also targets \nwomen. \n \n67.   Interventions to address ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) are not required as \nthe mainstream society in the Fiji Islands is made up of the indigenous population. There are no \nsocial or cultural identities that are \"distinct from that of the dominant or mainstream society.\" \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n68.  An initial environmental examination for the Project has confirmed the classification as \ncategory  B.  The  Project\u2019s  overall  environmental  effects  are  positive.  It  will  benefit  the \nenvironment through (i) a substantial reduction of sewage entering the groundwater, streams, \nand the sea because of inadequate treatment in septic tanks; (ii) a substantial reduction of \nsewage pump station failures and consequent overflows, which often seriously affect low-lying \ncommunities near coastal waters; (iii) the provision of sludge treatment facilities at the two \nproject water treatment plants; and (iv) better performance and effluent quality from the Kinoya \nsewage treatment plant. The rehabilitation and augmentation of that plant will enable access to \ncarbon credits through the Clean Development Mechanism. These improvements will help to \nreduce the pollution of streams, drains, and coastal waters in the project area. Environmental \nmonitoring  and  management  plans,  incorporated  into  civil  works  contracts,  are  being \nimplemented effectively and are monitored by the WSD's environment officer. \n \nE.  Risks and Assumptions \n69.  Institutional Reforms. WAF is scheduled to start operations on 1 January 2010. Some \ncrucial actions are required to ensure that the transition from WSD to WAF is effective. Although \nthe transfer of personnel from WSD to WAF commenced on 1 September 2009, the WAF \nstaffing structure and arrangements for transfer of staff units, staff assets, and records currently \nwithin WSD and MPUWT to WAF have not been finalized. Time-bound assurances have been \nincorporated into the Supplementary Loan Agreement to ensure that these tasks are completed \nbefore WAF starts operation as a fully functioning autonomous water and sewerage corporation. \n \n70.  Further Project Delays and Cost Increases. The risk of further project delays and cost \noverruns  is  considered  small  as  the  majority  of  the  works  have  been  awarded,  and  bid \ndocuments for works that have not yet been bid have been completed. To mitigate the risk of \nfurther cost overruns, physical contingencies of 15% have been provided in the revised project \ncost estimate. \n \n ", "17 \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n71.  In addition to the Loan covenants and assurances under Loan 2055-FIJ: Suva\u2013Nausori \nWater Supply and Sewerage Project, the Government has given the following assurances which \nare incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  Water  Authority  Fiji.

The  Government  will  ensure  that  all \nconsultants\u2019 and works contracts under the Project incorporate provisions and \nsufficient budget to require that all consultants and contractors: (a) comply with \nall  applicable  labor  laws  of  the  Government  and  related  international  treaty \nobligations and do not employ child labor; (b) do not provide differential wages or \nbenefits to men and women for work of equal value; (c) comply with all applicable \nhealth, and safety laws and regulations, including access to basic water and \nsanitation facilities for men and women on the work sites as well as access on \nthe work sites to separate toilet facilities for men and women; (d) provide day \ncare service for the children of women employed in connection with the Project, if \nso requested; and (e) carry out HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness campaigns \n ", "18 \nat the workers\u2019 campsites and/or residences and social halls (in the case of non-\nlocal workers), and include community heads and women leaders, with such \ncampaigns being held in coordination with the Government\u2019s existing programs \nand other initiatives. \n(xi)  Environment. The Government will ensure that all project facilities are designed, \nconstructed,  operated,  maintained,  and  monitored  in  compliance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  and  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002), it being agreed by the Government that, in case of \nany discrepancy between the Government\u2019s laws and regulations, and ADB's \nEnvironment Policy, the ADB policy requirements will apply. \n(xii)  The Government, through the PMU, will ensure that (a) contractors engaged \nunder the works contracts comply strictly with all environmental impact mitigation \nand  monitoring  requirements  set  out  in  the  contract  documents,  and  (b) \nconsultants engaged for construction supervision closely monitor compliance of \nthe  contractors  with  the  environmental  impact  mitigation  and  monitoring \nrequirements and reporting requirements. \n(xiii)  Gender  and  employment.  The  Government  will  take  all  reasonable  and \nnecessary  steps  to  encourage  women  living  in  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  Region  to \nparticipate  in  the  implementation  of  the  Project,  including  but  not  limited  to, \nadvertising  job  opportunities  in  women  community  centers  and  publishing \nnewspaper advertisements stressing that women are encouraged to apply. The \nGovernment will ensure that the PMU, as well as contractors and consultants \nemployed for the Project do not discriminate against female applicants and will \nexpressly encourage them to employ women for both skilled and unskilled labor \nneeds. \n(xiv)  Governance. The PMU will ensure that project staff (including the PMU staff, \ncontractors, and consultants) are fully knowledgeable of and comply with the \nGovernment\u2019s and ADB\u2019s procedures, including, but not limited to, procedures for \n(a) implementation, (b) procurement, (c) use of consultants, (d) disbursement, (e) \nreporting, (f) monitoring, and (g) prevention of fraud and corruption. \n(xv)  The  Borrower  shall  cause  WAF  to  (a)  conduct  periodic  inspections  on  the \ncontractors\u2019  activities  relating  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  and  (b) \nensure that all contracts financed under the Project include provisions specifying \nthe right of ADB to audit and examine the Project records and accounts of all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers of the Project. \n(xvi)  Within  2  months  of  the  effective  date,  MPU  shall  create  a  project  website, \naccessible by the general public, to disclose information about various matters \nconcerning  the  Project,  including  general  project  information,  procurement, \nproject progress, and contact details in the English, Fijian, and Hindi languages. \nThe  website  will  also  provide  a  link  to  ADB's  Integrity  Unit \n(http://www.adb.org/Integrity/complaint.asp)  for  reporting  grievances  or \nallegations of corrupt practices relating to the Project and project activities to \nADB. With regard to procurement, the website shall include information on the list \nof participating bidders, name of the winning bidder, basic details on bidding \nprocedures adopted, amount of contract awarded, and the list of goods and \nworks procured. \n(xvii)  Anticorruption  Policy.  The  Government  and  WAF  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy. The Government and WAF agree that ADB reserves the \nright:  (a)  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project;  and  (b)  to \ncooperate fully with any such investigation and extend all necessary assistance, \n ", "19 \nincluding  providing  access  to  all  relevant  information  and  records,  for  the \nsatisfactory completion of any such investigation. WAF will also: (a) conduct \nperiodic inspections on the contractors\u2019 activities relating to fund withdrawals and \nsettlements; and (b) ensure that all contracts financed by ADB in connection with \nthe Project include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine \nthe records and accounts of all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other \nservice providers of the Project. \n(xviii)  Physical component maintenance policy.

With estimated cost overruns of $41.8 million, the Government decided, where possible \nwithout compromising the project objectives, to reduce the scope of the Suva\u2013Nausori Water \nSupply  and  Sewerage  Project  by  shelving  some  components.  The  components  that  were \nshelved included the Rewa run-of-the-river scheme, extension of the sewerage network to \nservice the proposed Housing Authority development at Navitoka, development of an asset \nregister and geographic information system (GIS) system, and purchase of computers and \nequipment for the National Water Quality Laboratory and the National Pump Workshop. By not \nincluding these components in the Project, the estimated cost overrun has been reduced from \n$41.8 million to $27.7 million. \n \n2.  Rewa Run-of-the-River Scheme. While the raw water sources for the Suva\u2013Nausori \nregional water supply need to be augmented, as proposed through the Project's Rewa run-of-\nthe-river scheme, the Government considered it prudent to delay development of new water \nsources until additional water treatment capacity within the area is developed. The treatment \ncapacity  of  the  area\u2019s  two  water  treatment  plants  at  Waila  and  Tamavua  (even  after  the \nrehabilitation and augmentation works at both plants are completed under the Project) is lower \nthan the demand for treated water. Both plants operate at more than 120% of their rated \ntreatment capacities, which compromises the quality of  water produced, particularly during \nperiods of high flow in the Waimanu River and Savura Creek. The development of a new water \nsource preferably should be in conjunction with the development of a new water treatment \nfacility to service Nausori, the Rewa Delta area, and some areas north of Baulevu. The cost to \ndevelop a new water source and water treatment facility is estimated at $35 million, well beyond \nthe project budget. This component could be included in a possible future phase of the Project. \n \n3.  Navitoka Sewerage Scheme. Planning for the proposed Housing Authority subdivision \nat Navitoka is ongoing. Construction of the subdivision, which is unlikely to start until 2011, will \ninvolve substantial earthworks. If the proposed sewer extension to Navitoka is constructed \nbefore the subdivision, there is a significant risk that the sewers will have to be lowered or \nrelocated when the earthworks begin. To mitigate this risk, the Government decided to shelve \nthe construction of the Navitoka sewerage scheme until the earthworks for the subdivision are \ncomplete. The extension of the sewerage network to Navitoka could also be financed through a \npossible future phase of the Project. \n \n4.  Asset Register, GIS System, Computers, and Other Equipment. The Government \nhas funded, through its own resources, the development of the asset register and a GIS system. \nIt will also fund the purchase of computers and equipment for the National Water Quality \nLaboratory and the National Pump Workshop. Consequently, this component no longer needs \nto be financed through the project loan. \n \n \n ", "   \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n           \n   F$ Million    $ Million \n% of \nTotal \nForeign  Local  Total  Foreign  Local  Total  Base \nItem     Exchange  Currency Cost    Exchange  Currency Cost  Cost \n       \nA.

Methodology and Assumptions \n \n1.    The economic analyses were redone for the Suva\u2013Nausori Water Supply and Sewerage \nProject.  \n \n2.    In a typical economic analysis, project benefits and project costs (discounted at the \nopportunity cost of capital) are compared to assess economic viability. The benefits of water \nsupply and sewerage systems are widely accepted and documented. Foremost among these \nare  health  benefits  (e.g.,  reduction  in  disease  and  work  time  lost  due  to  illness)  and \nenvironmental  benefits  (e.g.,  higher  standard  of  living  and  cleaner  environment).  These \nsignificant  benefits  are  not  easily  quantified.  A  lower  incidence  of  disease  and  better \nenvironmental conditions may result from many factors, including the proposed investments. \nEconomic  analyses  have  been  developed  for  the  Project's  water  supply  and  sewerage \ncomponents individually. \n \n3.    The following general assumptions have been adopted for the reappraisal: \n(i)  Prices have been updated to reflect current (August 2009) cost estimates and \ncosts. \n(ii)  The least-cost analyses carried out for the Project in the 1999 master plan used \n1999 constant prices; hence, it is unnecessary to update them since the options \nhave not changed and price adjustments will affect all equally.  \n(iii)  Each project component is assumed to have a useful economic life of 40 years \nafter construction for civil works, and 15 years for electrical and mechanical \ncomponents. For the ADB-funded project, replacements have been included at \n2.5% of previous investment once every 5 years. \n(iv)  The  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  used  in  the  economic  analysis  is \nassumed to be the standard 12% per year. \n(v)  The average household size is 5.5 persons. Based on 2009 water consumption \ndata, they approximately consumed 180 liters per capita per day (lpcd). Supplies \nare assumed to have constrained demand, which is estimated to be 200 lpcd \nwith present incomes and present tariffs. \n(vi)  Wastewater generation is estimated at 80% of water consumption. \n(vii)  Capital  costs  include  physical  contingencies  (15%)  but  exclude  price \ncontingencies and interest during construction. \n(viii)  All economic costs, in particular of imported tradeable inputs, are net of duties \nand taxes.  \n(ix)  The economic opportunity cost of raw water provided to the Project is assumed \nto be zero. There are no competing uses of the raw water such as irrigation in the \nSuva\u2013Nausori area. \n(x)  The average official exchange rate of F$2.01 per $1.00 (as of August 2009) has \nbeen  employed  in  converting  foreign  exchange  costs  to  their  local  currency \nequivalent. \n \nB.  Economic Analysis  \n \n1.  Water Supply \n4.    Capital and operating costs were forecast for the duration of the Project. After these \nperiods,  operating  costs  are  held  constant  with  an  allowance  made  for  replacement  and \nrehabilitation at 2.5% of project capital costs every 5 years. No residual values are assumed at \n ", "  Appendix 8  35 \nthe end of 40 years. Operating costs include direct operation and maintenance, salaries and \nwages, and overhead.  \n \n5.    The physical project will provide water for sale, mainly through decreased physical and \nfinancial losses. The assumptions made for total losses are as follows: 2009, 53%; 2010, 40%; \n2011, 35%; 2012, 30%; 2013, 30%; 2014, 25%, and 2015 onwards, 20%.  \n \n6.    Non-incremental benefits include the following: (i) cost savings in meeting the demand of \nnew customers at present satisfied demand levels; and (ii) integration of the small water supply \nsystem servicing Colo-I-Suva into the Suva\u2013Nausori regional water supply system. The cost \nsavings in meeting the demand from new domestic customers was based on the difference in \nthe annual cost of households obtaining water from sources other than the regional water \nsupply  system\u2014including  rain  water  capture,  collection  of  water  from  shallow  wells,  and \npurchase of water during dry periods (about 2 months per year and costing F$8.00 per cubic \nmeter [m3])\u2014and the annual cost of water for a typical household with 5.5 occupants, each \nconsuming 180 liters per day calculated at current domestic tariff. The cost savings in meeting \nthe  demand  from  new  commercial  customers  is  based  on  the  difference  in  the  cost  of \npurchasing  water  from  water  tanker  operators  at  F$8.00  per  m3  and  the  cost  from  the \ncommercial tariff of F$0.53 per m3. Cost savings from decommissioning the small water supply \nsystem that services Colo-I-Suva following the expansion of the Suva\u2013Nausori regional water \nsupply system to Colo-I-Suva in 2009 is estimated at F$15,000 per year through reduced \noperator inputs and electricity and fuel costs. \n \n7.    Incremental  benefits  include  the  following:  (i)  meeting  suppressed  domestic  and \ncommercial demands, and (ii) non-revenue water consumed under the Project. As a result of \nlow water pressure to some consumers and frequent water disruptions, supplies are assumed to \nhave constrained demand. The average domestic per capita consumption of water is 180 lpcd. \nThe demand is estimated to be 200 lpcd (based on volumetric measurements to domestic \nconnections during periods of normal water pressure) with present incomes and tariffs. The \nannual cost saving that is estimated to result by satisfying suppressed domestic demand from \nthe  regional  water  supply  system,  assuming  a  suppressed  demand  of  20  lpcd,  a  typical \nhousehold  of  5.5  occupants,  and  a  willingness  to  pay  of  F$0.156  per  m3,  is  F$6.26  per \nhousehold. The suppressed commercial demand is estimated to average 200 liters per day per \ncommercial connection. Commercial suppressed demand is currently met through the purchase \nof water from water tanker operators at an average cost of F$8.00 per m3. The annual cost \nsaving that will result by satisfying commercial suppressed demand from the regional water \nsupply system at the current commercial tariff rate of F$0.53 per m3, is F$545 per commercial \nconnection. Valuation of these benefits is summarized in Table A8.1. \n \n8.    Willingness-to-pay  data  used  in  the  economic  analysis  was  obtained  from  a  2004 \ncustomer survey and statistical analysis of customer willingness to pay for water. The survey, \nwhich interviewed 250 randomly selected water supply customers, sought information on each \nrespondent\u2019s socioeconomic background, occupation, education level, and other parameters. It \nincluded statistically quantifiable and testable questions indicating the respondents\u2019 degree of \nwillingness to pay for water, under hypothetical increases in the quality and reliability of the \nwater supply service. Although the majority of respondents were low income, the study found a \nslightly positive but significant willingness to pay more for water than the respondents currently \npay\u201425% more than a bill based on the minimum block rate of $0.125 per 1,000 liters. The \nwillingness to pay survey and analysis also found that expressed willingness to pay is highly \nconstrained  by  a  lack  of  credibility  of  the  hypothetical  improvements  in  supply  that  the \nrespondents generally shared, no doubt borne of long experience with frequent and lengthy \nsupply interruptions and the widely perceived ineffectiveness of the Water Supply Department to \naddress such problems. \n ", "36   Appendix 8 \n \n \nTable A8.1: Economic Benefit Values for Water \nBenefit  Numerator  F$  Comment \nA.

Sewerage \n10.   The time frame of the sewerage economic analysis is the same as that of the water \nsupply component. Operating costs are held constant with an allowance for replacement and \nrehabilitation at 2.5% of project capital costs every 5 years. Salaries, wages, and overhead have \nbeen added to direct operation and maintenance. No residual values are assumed at the end of \n40 years.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  37 \n11.   Quantified benefits of Project's sewerage components include the following: (i) avoided \ncost of replacing and deluding septic tanks for the 9,300 urban allotments that will be connected \nto the sewerage system as a result of the Project and enforcement of existing laws compelling \nproperty owners to connect to sewerage systems where available; and (ii) avoided costs of \nreplacing the Kinoya sewage treatment plant and existing sewers, which would be required in \nthe absence of the Project's rehabilitation and augmentation works for the Kinoya sewage \ntreatment plant and rehabilitation of key sewers. \n \n12.   In the absence of the sewerage components of the Project, about 6,300 households and \nbusiness in the Suva\u2013Nausori area will continue with individual on-site treatment systems, \nwhich are primarily small septic tanks. For the economic analysis, a design life of 15 years has \nbeen assumed, during which all households would rely on septic tanks for sewage treatment \nand disposal, and the design life of the septic tanks is 15 years. The average cost of a septic \ntank  built  to  building  code  requirements  is  F$4,000  (or  F$267  per  year).  Because  of  the \nrelatively high household occupancy rate in the Suva\u2013Nausori area (5.5 persons), septic tanks \nrequire pumping out on average once every 3 years. The average septic tank pumping out cost \nis F$500 (or F$167 per year). \n \n13.   Existing sewers in the low-lying sections of the Suva\u2013Nausori area, including the Suva \ncentral business district (CBD) and Nausori town, are dilapidated and prone to leaks. Many of \nthe sewers are more than 60 years old, constructed from concrete, and located below the mean \nsea level. Seawater that leaks into the sewers is pumped to the Kinoya and Nausori sewage \ntreatment plants, adding to the costs of operating the sewerage system. A survey in 1999 to \nestimate the volume of sea water entering the Suva City sewers concluded that more than 50% \nof the inflow to the Kinoya sewage treatment plant was seawater. The high seawater content in \nsewage inflow to the Kinoya plant has resulted in accelerated dilapidation of the mechanical \nsystems. \n \n14.   The sewage pump stations that pump sewage from collector and trunk sewers within the \narea are also highly dilapidated and frequently are out of service. This results in a buildup of \npotentially lethal hydrogen sulfide gas, which is (i) an occupational health and safety issue for \nsewer system operators, and (ii) extremely corrosive to concrete and metallic structures. The \ncombination of high seawater content and hydrogen sulfide gas within the sewers, if unchecked, \nwill ultimately result in the failure of sewerage system, which could require the replacement of \nsewers and the entire Kinoya sewage treatment plant. The replacement cost of the sewers at \ncurrent prices is estimated at F$45 million within the Suva CBD and F$9 million in Nausori town. \nThe cost to replace the Kinoya plant is estimated at F$30 million. The Project's sewerage \ncomponents, particularly the inflow and infiltration (leak) reduction component, the rehabilitation \nof the Kinoya plant, and the rehabilitation of major and minor sewage pump stations, will \nsignificantly delay the need for the replacement of sewers and the Kinoya sewage treatment \nplant. For the purposes of this economic analysis, the replacement of the Kinoya plant has been \nassumed to be required in 2015. The replacement of sewers in the Suva CBD has been \nassumed to be required in 2015 and for Nausori town in 2020. \n \n15.   The estimated EIRR for the sewerage component of the Project is 12.7%. Sensitivity \ntests for the project sewerage component yield EIRRs of less than 12% under adverse changes \nin some of the assumptions (Table A8.3). \n \n ", "38   Appendix 8 \n \nTable A8.3: Economic Sensitivity Analysis for Sewerage Components \n(%) \nItem  Change  EIRR  SV \nBase Case    12.7   \nCapital Costs Increase  20  11.9  18.2 \nOperating Costs Increase  20  12.3  37.3 \nTotal Benefits Decrease  (20)    9.0    3.8 \n( ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, SV = switching value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nc.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nPoor persons in the Suva\u2013Nausori area suffer from poor quality of water supplies, lack of sanitation, and pollution of the \nstreams and underground water. Infantile diarrhea is common, and many households are forced to boil their drinking water to \npurify it, which is costly. \n \nThe Project will help provide potable water without frequent service interruptions, which are common for the majority of poor \nhouseholds in the project area. It will also make sewage collection available, although with a lower coverage than water, to a \nsubstantial number of poor households. Further, the Project will help improve the quality of water in the streams and coastal \nareas along which many poor people live. It will substantially benefit the poor by improving the quality of their water supply, \nimproving their sanitation, reducing pollution and eliminating the need to boil drinking water for those with pipes or water \nconnections. Since the cost of water and sewerage will decrease for the poor, the net benefit flows will be substantial. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: General intervention (GI) \n1. Key Issues  \nSome of the poorest households in the Suva\u2013Nausori area have limited access to safe water and adequate sanitation. \nConsequently, they are at greater risk than the general community for waterborne diseases. The poorest households cannot \nafford access to the water supply or to better sanitation facilities, resulting in more health risks, environmental degradation, \nand loss of amenities. The Project directly benefits the poorest households in the Suva\u2013Nausori area by increasing the \ncoverage and the level of service of the water supply and sewerage systems. Poor households will also benefit from \nenvironmental improvements resulting from better wastewater management services. \n \n2. Design Features  \nThe Project\u2019s water supply component will help reduce health risks, such as infantile diarrhea, that are caused by the lack of \nwater and contamination of water arising from low pressure in the piped system. It will also provide water for cooking, washing, \nand bathing, and reduce the need to boil water. Improvements to sewage disposal to prevent contamination of waterways will \nbenefit the poorest residents who live in swampy, low-lying, poorly draining areas near the coast, such as in Vatuwaqa and along \nthe Samabula River. Residents of these communities use these waterways for fishing and supplementing their food sources. The \nenvironmental benefits of the Project\u2019s sewerage component will improve the quality of life for the poorest people. Because of the \nglobal financial crisis and recent political events, more households in the Suva\u2013Nausori area are facing hardship. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe 2002 urban Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) found that about 45% of housing in the project area was \nof lower standard than that in settlements, Housing Authority units, squatter areas, or urban villages. The 2002 HIES also \nfound that 26.5% of the urban population lived in settlements, with an additional 10.3% living in squatter areas. Those living in \nHousing Authority or Public Rental Board flats accounted for 5.3% of the urban population, and urban villages accounted for \n4.5%. The 2002 HIES also noted that the highest unemployment rate (23.1%) was found in the urban villages, closely \nfollowed by squatter areas (19.8%), Housing Authority or Public Rental Board flats (17.6%), and settlements (15.8%). It was \nfurther noted that 77.2% of the unemployed had achieved a secondary level education, and 15% had post-secondary \neducation. The Central and Eastern Division urban areas\u2014primarily the Suva\u2013Nausori corridor\u2014accounted for 55% of \nunemployment. Of these unemployed, just more than half were living in low-quality housing, squatter settlements, or villages, \nwhere the findings of the participatory assessment of hardship conducted under the ADB technical assistance for preparation \nof national poverty reduction strategies in Pacific developing member countries in February\u2013March 2003 suggested that \naccess to safe water and sanitation is the poorest. \n \nAlthough the 2002 urban HIES reported that 96% (up from 93% in 1996) of households in the project area had access to a \nsafe water supply, this figure is misleading. While many households have access to a piped supply, this is frequently \ninterrupted and poor quality. Of the remainder, 2.2% used a communal standpipe, while 1.5% obtained water from rainwater \ntanks, wells, rivers, or some other method. Communal standpipes were located only in informal settlements and villages. \nSignificantly, only one household indicated it was obtaining water from a river or creek, and this was not its sole source.  \n \n ", "40   Appendix 9 \n \nThe 2002 HIES reported that in the Suva\u2013Nausori urban area the proportion of households with a flush system was 83% with \na further 8% having water-seal latrines. About 30% of households are connected to the Suva\u2013Nausori regional sewerage \nscheme. The HIES reported that 80% of households used pit latrines or did not have any access to sanitation facilities. Pump \nstation and sewer overflows, pit latrine and septic tank seepage, and industrial discharges all end up in waterways. This is a \nthreat to public health since these waterways are used for fishing and collecting shellfish, and are close to where many people \nlive. The most vulnerable people are squatters along rivers or creeks, such as in Kinoya and Vatuwaqa. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nConsultations have been ongoing with stakeholders throughout the project implementation period. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Information sharing      Consultation     Collaborative decision making     Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes    No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nThe Project includes a community education and public awareness program, which was implemented under the attached \ntechnical assistance. The program was undertaken during 2006 and included  \n(i)  preparation and pre-testing of information resources, \n(ii)  consultative group meetings, \n(iii)  public relations activities, and \n(iv)  development of the communication program. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. Lack of water places an extra burden on women and children by making the collection and storage of water \nmore difficult. Intermittent cuts in water supply inconvenience women the most. In both indigenous Fijian and Indo-Fijian \ncultures, women have prime responsibility for water and sanitation at home. They are the principal carers for children, and \nthey have control over food preparation, bathing, toileting, and hygiene of these children. Thus, the Project will have a \nsignificant effect on women in terms of improving environmental conditions, the water supply, and family health conditions. \nThe community education and awareness program also targets women. \n \n2.
