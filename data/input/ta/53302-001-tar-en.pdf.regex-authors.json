INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) aims to deepen the skills and \ncapacity to plan and implement effective communications strategies in developing member \ncountries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The TA will develop and deliver \ncommunications capacity building activities for DMCs, primarily for planning and finance ministries \nand  related  agencies.  The  TA  will  promote  interactions  among  government  officials  and \ninternational experts to enable them to share lessons, knowledge, and experience related to \ncommunications in a range of contexts.  \n \n2.  This  TA  aligns  with  Strategy  2030,  particularly  in  its  emphasis  on  major  global \ncommitments, such as the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate \nchange.  It emphasizes ADB\u2019s role as (a) a knowledge provider focused on practical solutions that \nfit local conditions, identify lessons, and replicate good practices across the region and beyond; \nand (b) a convener of partnerships to promote dialogue and collaboration among development \npartners and stakeholders such as the private sector, philanthropic organizations, academe, \nfoundations, and aid and development agencies. Improved communications will contribute to \nachieving Strategy 2030\u2019s goal of supporting DMC governments\u2019 institutional capacity and ability \nto efficiently plan, design, and implement policies, programs, and projects to enable their delivery \nof country development plans and contribution to global commitments.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  A development challenge. DMC officials responsible for the communications function in \ntheir organizations lack the skills and capacity required to effectively meet rising demands for \ninformation and transparency, and to manage communications challenges that may adversely \naffect the planning and prioritizing, design and implementation of government policies, programs, \nor projects. There are at least two effects of this situation: (a) stakeholders lack information on \ngovernment policies, programs, or projects that may lead to opposition, resulting in delay and/or \nadditional costs during design and implementation and (b) government ministries or agencies are \nunable to effectively manage or respond to reputational risks that could reduce public trust in their \nability to plan, design, and implement government policies, programs, or projects. The Report of \nthe G20 Eminent Persons Group on Global Financial Governance called on international financial \ninstitutions \u201cto put risk at the center\u201d of their strategies, including building trust and transparency \namong different players.2 \n \n4.  Rapidly evolving communications environment. The communications environment in \nDMCs is rapidly evolving as expanded digitization and internet access fuels content creation, \nfeeds the 24-hour news cycle, and powers pervasive social media use and social networking. \nThis  environment  changes  how  the  public  interacts  with  and  consumes  information  from \ngovernments and other sources, and how individuals perceive government decisions and actions. \nThe rapidly evolving communications environment directly impacts the work of communications \nprofessionals  and demands  new  approaches  to achieve  the communications objectives of \ngovernment ministries and agencies. Without having a broad set of skills and strategic planning \ncapabilities to manage communications, DMC officials cannot effectively convey the development \nagenda needed to get buy-in for key government initiatives from the public. ADB\u2019s prior technical \nassistance to support communications officials in DMCs identified the need to broaden their skills \n \n1 The TA first appeared in the Business Opportunities section of the ADB website on 10 December 2019. \n2 Global Financial Governance. 2018. Making the Global Financial System Work for All. \n \n ", "2 \nand  strategic  communications  planning  and  execution  capability  to  effectively  manage \ncommunications across traditional, digital, and other channels to build awareness, understanding, \nand support for government policies, programs, and projects.3 \n \n5.  Rising public expectations about transparency and participation. The growing ease \nof access to information, expansion of social media, and proliferation of information sources have \nincreased  public  expectations  about  government  transparency  and  public  demand  for \nopportunities to participate in government decision-making and implementation. The development \ncommunity has recognized the value of two-way communications systems that enable dialogue \nand allow communities to express their aspirations and concerns and participate in decisions \nconcerning their development.4 DMC communicators must leverage new approaches, tools, and \ntechnologies to meet these demands. This will require increasingly sophisticated efforts to (a) \nestablish communications objectives, (b) identify and understand the views of key stakeholders, \n(c) develop strategic messaging frameworks and content, (d) select appropriate channels and \ntools for information dissemination, and (e) execute communications plans. \n \n6.  Insufficient on-the-job training. Competition for limited resources within and among \ngovernment agencies often limits learning opportunities for those responsible for communications \nfunctions. Learning to mainstream modern, cost-efficient, and context-appropriate tools and \nmethods in communications planning and administration would greatly address this gap and more \neffectively convey messages to intended stakeholders. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: institutional capacity and transparency for the \nimplementation of development policies and projects improved.5 The TA will have the following \noutcome: communications planning and implementation in participating DMCs improved.6 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Communications planning and implementation capacity strengthened. \nThe TA will support at least 10 national capacity building activities, such as seminars, workshops, \nand training.  \n  \n9.  The course structure and training levels will be progressive, from basic to intermediate to \nadvanced, over the TA period to develop a core of well-trained communications staff in target \ngovernment ministries and agencies. Depending on the results of the training needs assessment \nfor  each  DMC,  course  content  may  cover  any  combination  of  the  following:  (a)  strategic \ncommunications  principles  and  approaches;  (b)  stakeholder  identification;  (c)  message \ndevelopment; (d) campaign planning and management; (e) content development; (f) social media \nstrategy, including applying digital, web, and mobile technologies; (g) media interaction; (h) \n \n3 Asian Development Bank. 2017.

Manila. \n6 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "3 \nmeasurement and evaluation; and (i) issue management and crisis communications.7 The TA will \nallow flexibility in the course design. \n \n10.  Course design will include gathering and validation of baseline data. ADB will encourage \ninnovative  course  delivery,  such  as  \u201cblended  learning\u201d  that  may  consist  of  instructor-led \npresentation, individual e-learning, and group work to stimulate active and engaged learners. \n \n11.  ADB will collaborate with private sector, academic, and communications professionals and \norganizations  to  bring  the  latest  know-how  in  communications.  Where  possible,  ADB  will \ncoordinate with the ADB Institute to deliver these capacity building activities. The TA is envisioned \nto  further  strengthen  ADB\u2019s  value  proposition  as  a  knowledge  provider,  particularly  in \ncommunications. \n \n12.  Output 2: Network of developing member country communications professionals \nestablished. The TA will provide opportunities for knowledge and experience sharing among \ngovernment officials in their communications functions, and, as appropriate, with DMC journalists \nand international and regional media, through at least three subregional forums and one regional \nforum. \n \n13.  The  forums  will  enable  DMC  officials,  including  participants  at  national  seminars, \nworkshops, and training, to interact with counterparts from other DMCs, international experts, \nlearning institutions and/or organizations, and ADB staff to understand a range of perspectives \nand approaches to managing strategic communications in different contexts. The design of the \nTA will include lessons learned from ADB\u2019s extensive experience in regional cooperation and \nintegration. Materials presented at the subregional and regional forums will be captured and \ndisseminated widely through ADB and partner channels such as Asian Development Blog, \nDevelopment Asia and ADB Institute. The TA will identify the participants\u2019 preferred networking \nchannels  and  will  support  a  simple,  cost-effective  digital  networking  solution  to  extend \ninteractions, thereby enabling a community of communications professionals. Participation and \nsupport of private sector groups and philanthropic organizations will contribute to sustaining a \nnetwork of communications professionals.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $975,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF)\u2014comprising $775,000 from TASF-6 and $200,000 \nfrom TASF-Other Sources.8 The key expenditures are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA through the Department of Communications, which will develop \nand implement the TA in consultation with operations and knowledge departments, ADB Institute, \nand resident missions, particularly in (a) selecting pilot DMCs; (b) coordinating local TA activities; \n \n7 Message and content development modules will use materials that cover ADB\u2019s key operational priorities and drivers \nof  change.  Topics  may  include  poverty,  gender,  environmental  sustainability,  climate  change,  public  sector \ndevelopment, energy, finance, and water and other urban infrastructure. \n8 The TA activities will primarily target DMCs belonging to groups A and B of ADB\u2019s classification, financed by TASF-\n6, while activities for select group C countries will be financed by TASF-Other Sources.

Using quality and cost-based selection, ADB will recruit a \nconsulting firm with expertise in designing and delivering communications training. ADB will hire \nan individual international consultant to advise the Department of Communications by reviewing \nthe course design to ensure quality training and by evaluating the feedback to measure impact. \nIn addition, ADB will hire a national consultant to provide logistics and administration support. \nThey will all be part of one consultant team, which will be led by a representative from the firm \nunder the supervision of ADB staff. Where possible, ADB will consider output-based contracts \nand/or lump-sum cost provision for out-of-pocket expenses for administrative efficiency. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $975,000 on a grant basis for \nEnhancing Communications Skills and Capacity of Developing Member Countries in Asia and the \nPacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n9  Selection of pilot DMCs will take into consideration (i) regional representation, (ii) interest and readiness of concerned \nagencies to adopt modern communications approaches, and (iii) allow participants to attend and complete a \nprogressive training course. Subregional and regional forums will offer the opportunity for cross-regional learning \namong participating DMC officials. Indicative selection criteria: (i) mid- to senior-level DMC officials and (ii) officials \nwho lead or support communications in planning and/or finance ministries or their subagencies.
