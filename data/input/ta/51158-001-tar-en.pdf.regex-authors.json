INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  improve  the  delivery  of \ninformation to farmers to help enhance their livelihoods. The TA will strengthen the existing use \nof information and communication technology (ICT) to deliver low-cost, timely, and actionable \nextension information to smallholder farmers specific to their needs, to increase their ability to \nimprove yields.1 The TA builds on and strengthens the outcomes of the loan for the Integrated \nParticipatory Development and Management of Irrigation Program, to maximize investments in \ninfrastructure  development  and  value  chain  services,  improving  the  delivery  of  extension \ninformation to farmers and building the capacity of extension workers.2 The TA locations will \noverlap with the program in three districts to identify locations, crops, and strategic value chains \nwith  high  potential  to  improve  production,  increase  profitability,  and  boost  incomes  for \nsmallholders.3 The TA is aligned with the priorities of Asian Development Bank (ADB) country \npartnership  strategy  for  Indonesia,  2016\u20132019,  and  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations \nbusiness plan, 2017\u20132019 for Indonesia. 4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Agriculture plays an important role in Indonesia\u2019s efforts to improve food security, reduce \npoverty, and promote inclusive growth. Agriculture employs 39 million people (almost a third of \nthe total workforce) and is the main source of employment in rural areas. In March 2017, about \n13.9% of the rural population was classified as poor, compared to 7.7% of the urban population.5 \nHowever, productivity in agriculture is very low.6 Efforts to boost agricultural productivity include \nincreasing smallholder yields, focusing production on high-value crops, developing agro-industry, \nand reducing post-harvest and value chain waste. These investments are important to optimize \nagricultural production and increase farm incomes and rural employment, which will positively \nimpact the growth of the nonfarm sector. \n \n3.  Agriculture in Indonesia is dominated by smallholder farmers.7 However, smallholders \nface challenges in increasing productivity and commercializing their produce. One way to boost \nsmallholders\u2019 agricultural productivity and diversification is to address their inadequate access to \nvalue or supply chain inputs, quality irrigation infrastructure, finance, and, in particular, extension \ntechnology, services, and information.  The Government of Indonesia has undertaken a range of \ninvestments  to strengthen  irrigation management  and  agricultural  value  chain  development \n(footnote 2); yet, millions of smallholder farmers remain unable to maximize opportunities and \ncapture the economic benefits of these investments. A key problem is the insufficient access to \n                                                \n1  Agricultural extension refers to the application of scientific research and knowledge to agricultural practices to \nincrease productivity through dissemination of information, provision of technical support, and education to farmers. \n2  ADB. 2017.

The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 August 2017. \n5  Badan Pusat Statistik Indonesia (Indonesian Central Bureau of Statistics). Social and Population Statistics. \nhttps://www.bps.go.id/linkTabelStatis/view/id/1494 (accessed 31 August 2017). \n6  In 2016, agriculture accounted for 13.5% of Indonesia\u2019s gross domestic product. World Bank. World Development \nIndicators.  http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.AGR.TOTL.ZS.  (accessed 24 August 2017). Annual productivity \nin agriculture ($3,000 per worker) is very low compared to neighboring countries like Malaysia, where the annual \nvalue added per worker is $9,000.

The Archipelago Economy: Unleashing \nIndonesia\u2019s Potential.  http://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/asia-pacific/the-archipelago-economy \n7  Over 90% of crops are cultivated by smallholders, except oil palm. The main crops are rice, soybean, corn, coffee, \ncocoa, fruits, and vegetables, which are high-value produce and offer strong prospects to smallholders. \n ", "2 \nand exchange of up-to-date extension information. \n \n4.  Farmers need access to and the ability to exchange up-to-date information on (i) local \nsources,  availability,  and  costs  of  inputs  for  production  to  minimize  their  dependence  on \nintermediaries;  (ii)  different  techniques  and  technologies  for  increasing  productivity  and \ndiversifying into more commercial crops; (iii) real-time weather reports, cropping patterns, and soil \nand water management to cope with climate variability; (iv) crop and food processing to add value \nto their raw produce; (v) food storage to minimize post-harvest losses; and (vi) marketing and \nlinks to markets to maximize profitability.   \n \n5.  On the supply side, the flow and exchange of information rely on a conventional extension \nservices approach whereby extension workers travel to rural areas to train farmers on new \ntechnologies and improved farm management. However, this approach is limited in terms of reach \nand quality.8 Key constraints faced by extension workers include (i) limited technology training \nand access to information, (ii) inadequate communication skills, (iii) insufficient transport budgets \nto  reach  farmers  spread  out  over  large  areas,  and  (iv)  limited  monitoring  capacity.  The \ngovernment also needs more feedback as to the viability of its investments and policies.9 \nDecentralization has weakened the agricultural public extension system, and heightened the gaps \nand disparities among regions. The impact of the fragmented institutional setup combined with \nthe lack of information further limits the ability of many farmers to escape poverty. \n \n6.  Current initiatives, lessons, and synergy. The TA draws upon the knowledge base and \nexperience of ADB and other key stakeholders. Current initiatives include (i) Cyber Extension, a \nnational, web-based, agricultural information portal run by the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) for \nfarmers at the district level through 5,568 rural extension centers; (ii) the AgriFin Mobile program \nsupported by Mercy Corps that provides bundled and customized farm management tools and \nfinancial services to smallholder farmers using both regular and android phones; and (iii) other \nweb-based platforms developed by universities.  Lessons learned include the following: (i) any \nintervention  should  be  financially  affordable  for  farmers  and  extension  workers;  (ii)  the \nengagement of a local knowledge provider, including the private sector, is essential to provide \ncutting-edge, up-to-date information; (iii) any intervention should be user-friendly, reliable, and \nbacked  by  trusted,  neutral  sources  of  information;  and  (iv)  capacity  development  and  the \nengagement of farmers and key stakeholders will create ownership and lead to sustainability.10 \nThe TA will build on the AgriFin model and ensure that Cyber Extension provides a back-up \ndatabase for the substantive technology content. \n \n7.  Innovation  and  sustainability.  There  is  high  demand  to  improve  the  provision  of \ninformation to farmers.11 The project builds on the preliminary concept of AgriFin and expands its \nservices.12 Key innovative elements include (i) the provision of specific local market information \n                                                \n8  There is a wide disparity in the education and skill levels of the 28,000 government extension workers employed to \nsupport 71,000 villages. Most are able to provide general information but lack skills in high-value commodities. \n9  Only 45% of the nation\u2019s irrigation system is functioning at full capacity. It is essential to enhance real-time information \nexchange among farmers, water user associations, and irrigation commissions to improve the operation and \nmaintenance of irrigation systems. \n10  ADB. 2011. Completion Report: Poor Farmers\u2019 Income Improvement through Innovation Project. Manila.  \n11  Farmers and extension workers agree that mobile phones are a key tool to reach farmers. 85% of Indonesia\u2019s \npopulation own mobile phones and 43% carry smart phones.

This does not include the full \n ", "3 \nand linkages with markets, (ii) platforms to link farmers with value chain groups and irrigation \nauthorities, and (iii) a public\u2013private partnership model to support the provision of agricultural \ninformation to farmers through mobile phones. The system will be technically and financially viable \nand may lead to mass commercial uptake. Key factors that will support the project\u2019s sustainability \ninclude (i) demand-driven support to introduce innovative solutions to large numbers of farmers, \n(ii) an exit strategy that supports financial and commercial viability in the value chain,13 (iii) \nconsultation of and effective engagement with key stakeholders to ensure that developed models \nare accepted, (iv) a strong monitoring and evaluation system to ensure that needed results are \nachieved,  and  (v)  capacity  building  for  all  stakeholder  institutions  and  building  of  national \nchampions along with parallel training and support for farmers in utilizing ICT services for  \nsustainability. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: rural incomes, food security, and livelihoods \nimproved (2015\u20132019 National Medium-Term Development Plan and 2005\u20132025 Long-Term \nNational Development Plan). The TA will have the following outcome: management of agricultural \nextension information services in three districts in rural Indonesia improved.14  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n9.  Output 1: Model and strategy developed for using information and communication \ntechnology for agricultural information exchange. This output will (i) review initiatives on the \nuse of ICT in agriculture, covering technological, institutional, financial, and economic aspects; (ii) \nconsult relevant agencies and private providers; (iii) identify the farmers\u2019 specific knowledge \nrequirements and constraints on access to information; (iv) develop criteria and identify project \nlocations and beneficiaries; (v) build on the AgriFin and Cyber Extension models, and identify \nappropriate technologies to process and deliver this knowledge; (vi) assess the feasibility and \nsustainability of such technologies; and (vii) prepare a capacity development plan for the use of \nICT services by extension workers and farmers.  \n \n10.  Output 2: Context specific, low-cost, timely, and actionable information provided. \nThis output will implement the ICT model in three districts.15 Key activities will include (i) facilitating \nan agreement between the MOA and a mobile network provider to provide a financially feasible \npackage  for  farmers  and  extension  workers;  (ii)  upgrading  the  application  and  developing \nsubstantive content; (iii) developing standard operating procedures; (iv) developing training of \n                                                \nrange of services needed by farmers, such as information and linkage with input suppliers, buyers, and irrigation \nauthorities, among others. The TA builds on this model by including additional services.  \n13  The exit strategy will be based on (i) an agreement with a mobile network operator to provide an affordable internet \npackage based on farmers\u2019 and extension workers\u2019 willingness to pay (preliminary discussions indicate that extension \nworkers are willing to pay $10\u2013$15 and farmers $5\u2013$10 per month for the use of mobiles); (ii) minimal transaction \nfees levied on key stakeholders, other than farmers, at various points of the value chain, such as buyers, input \nproviders, and commercial banks. In addition, Cyber Extension will provide a back-up database for the substantive \ntechnology content. The TA will ensure that the exit strategy is tested and refined during project implementation. \n14 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n15 The project services will reach approximately 100,000 farmers in the selected districts. Each district is assumed to \nhave the following average number of farmers: (i) 80,000 in Java, (ii) 10,000 in Sumatra, and (iii) 10,000 in Eastern \nIndonesia. \n ", "4 \ntrainers16 and other capacity development activities for the applications and services;17 (v) field \nfacilitation and monitoring of all activities; (vi) establishing a project monitoring system, and \ndeveloping and maintaining a monitoring and evaluation database that includes farmer profiles; \nand (vii) developing and implementing an exit strategy. The output will also analyze monitoring \nand  evaluation  data  emanating  from  the  TA,  Integrated  Participatory  Development  and \nManagement of Irrigation Program, and other interventions to identify and undertake thematic \nstudies on key issues for policy advocacy pertinent to the whole sector.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,200,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. Key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n12.  Under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, ineligible expenditures include (i) purchase \nof vehicles, (ii) salaries for civil servants, (iii) foreign travel, (iv) scholarships or long internships, \n(v) detailed engineering design, (vi) civil works and other related expenses, and (vii) those under \nADB\u2019s List of Ineligible Items (or Negative List) and Prohibited Investment Activities List.18  \n \n13.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office space, counterpart \nsalaries, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. The Southeast Asia Department will select, supervise, and \nevaluate consultants. The executing agency will be the Directorate of Water Resources and \nIrrigation and Directorate of Food and Agriculture of the National Development Planning Agency \n(Badan Perencanaan dan Pembangunan Nasional [BAPPENAS]).
