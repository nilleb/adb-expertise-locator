During the 2003 Country Programming Mission for the People's Republic of China (PRC), \nthe  Government  confirmed  its  request  for  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  help  formulate  and \nimplement policy reform in road  transport.1 The Asian Development Bank (ADB)  Fact-Finding \nMission visited the PRC in  September 2003 and  discussed road transport sector issues with \nofficials of the central Government. This report is based on the understanding and agreement \nreached  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  scope,  costs,  terms  of  reference,  and \nimplementation arrangements for the TA, and the Mission's observations in the field. The  TA \nframework, outlining the goal, purpose, outputs, and inputs, is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC\u2019s economic development in the last decade has resulted in a rapid growth in \ntransport  demand.  The  economy\u2019s  changing  structure  and  increasing  diversification  have \naltered the pattern of transport demand. Between 1992 and 2002, the demand for road freight \ntransport grew at 6.1% per annum, reaching 678 billion ton-kilometer (km), which was faster \nthan the growth of the total freight market. Consequently, the share of road transport in total \nfreight transport rose from 12.9% to 13.4%. The demand for road passenger transport also grew \nfaster than the total passenger transport market at 9.4% per annum during the same period, \nreaching 781 billion passenger-km. The modal share of roads in the total passenger transport \nrose from 45.9%  in 1992  to 55.3% in 2002. The growth in  the demand for road transport \nresulted, in part, from deregulation in the road transport industry. The movement of goods and \npassengers will increasingly be by road, as road transport is more flexible and responsive to \nneeds in a market economy than other modes. \n \n3.  In line with growth in transport demand, the vehicle fleet expanded rapidly. In 2002, the \nvehicle fleet totaled 20.5 million trucks, cars, buses, and other motorized vehicles (motorcycles \nand agricultural vehicles), three times the size of the 1992 fleet. The number of privately owned \nmotor vehicles increased eight times during this period, from 1.2 million vehicles to 9.7 million. \nTrucks accounted for 35% of the total privately owned vehicles; cars and buses, 64%; and other \nspecialized vehicles, 1%. Despite the rapid increase in the total number of vehicles, there were \nonly 1.6 vehicles (truck, car, or bus) per 100 people. This figure is low relative to other countries in \nthe Asia and Pacific region.2 Not until the early 1980s were modern vehicles imported and joint \nventures formed with foreign automobile manufacturers to introduce modern technology. Given \nthe PRC's rapid economic growth and low vehicle ownership, both the public and private vehicle \nfleets are expected to continue to grow rapidly in the coming years. This will result in substantial \nincreases in the volume of road traffic, mounting congestion, and more vehicle emissions. The \nhigh share of slow-moving traffic, mainly tractors, bicycles, and nonmotorized agricultural vehicles, \naggravates road congestion, and is a major cause of traffic accidents. \n \n4.  Private sector participation and owner-operator businesses have grown rapidly in the \nroad transport industry. This has improved the level of service and increased competition, thus \nensuring that some of the savings in vehicle operating costs resulting from better roads are \npassed on to customers. In 2001, there were 558,000 passenger transport operators with 1.4 \nmillion vehicles and 16.9 million passenger seats. Of these, 561,000 vehicles (41%) with 5.5 \nmillion passenger seats (32%) belonged to individual operators. There were 4.1 million freight \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 10 December 2002. \n2  Figures for other countries are 2.5 for India, 5.0 for Indonesia, 14.3 for Thailand, 59.6 for Australia, and 65.3 for \nJapan. ", "2  \ntransport operators with 4.6 million vehicles and a capacity of 15.7 million tons. Of these, 2.3 \nmillion vehicles (or 51%) with a capacity  of 6.6 million tons (42%) belonged to individual \noperators. Only a small number of large operators are in the road transport. While the number of \ngood quality buses and passenger seats increased annually at 14.2% and 23.8%, respectively, \nbetween 1996 and 2001, these premium services still accounted for a small share of the total. \nThe transport capacity in rural areas and level of service are low. Improvements are needed to \nmeet the transport demand. Energy efficient large trucks accounted for only 38.1% of the fleet \nwhile small trucks accounted for 51.1%. Structural adjustments in vehicle size and type are \nneeded to improve the quality and efficiency of the road transport industry and to improve fuel \nefficiency of the fleet. \n \n5.  The Government is aware of the  broad issues affecting road transport and plans to \nincrease the operating efficiency of the industry to  increase the overall capacity to transport \nfreight and passengers. This will help to satisfy the growing demand and complement the capital \ninvestment in road construction. Some reform initiatives have been implemented. The trucking \nindustry has been deregulated and market entry has become easier. A system of national \npermits  has  been  developed  for  interprovincial  trucking  companies.  Freight  tariffs  are \ndetermined by the market, and privately owned freight operators account for 74% of the industry. \nPassenger fares are still regulated by provincial governments, and public bus companies are \nlargely owned by provincial communications departments. \n \n6.  Despite this progress, the operating efficiency of the road transport industry is low, partly \nbecause the policy and regulatory framework is not yet suitable for a market economy. Also \noperations, management, and maintenance practices of road transport operators need to be \nimproved. A policy and regulatory environment conducive to improving the provision of transport \nservices needs to be created. Laws and regulations need to be modified to open up the road \ntransport  market  to  foreign  operators  in  line  with  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO) \naccession agreement. The current administrative system for examining and approving operators \nneeds  to  be  reformed  to  foster  development  of  the  road  transport  industry.  Structural \nadjustments in road transport are needed in the following areas: (i) organizational restructuring \nto  make  the  road  transport  enterprises  more  commercially  viable; (ii)  improving  the  low \ntechnology,  unreliable,  and  uncomfortable  vehicles  to  meet  technical  standards  in  safety, \nenvironmental impact, fuel efficiency, and capacity; and (iii) developing new services such as \nfreight forwarding and automobile maintenance to meet the changing transport demand. A more \ntransparent  and  open  market  for  road  transport  and  automobile  maintenance  must  be \nestablished by addressing problems of traffic safety and service quality caused by illegal \noperations  and  maintenance,  local  monopolies,  and  overloading  of  trucks.  Finally,  road \ntransport laws and regulations need to be enforced more effectively. To do so requires raising \nthe awareness and skill base of traffic enforcement officers. \n \n7.  The impact of the PRC\u2019s WTO accession agreement to open the transport market to \nforeign companies needs to be analyzed. In the road transport sector, this requirement applies \nto transport operation services, maintenance and repair services, and storage and warehousing \nservices. Prior to the effectivity of these commitments in 2001, foreign investment was not \nallowed to exceed 49% in joint ventures in these  areas. Within  1 year of effectivity (2002), \nforeign majority ownership was allowed, and by 2004, wholly foreign-owned subsidiaries will be \nallowed. Under the terms of the PRC\u2019s WTO accession,  cooperative businesses and wholly \nforeign-owned enterprises enjoy equal treatment with domestic companies. An ADB-financed ", "  3\nTA3 recommended opening the transport and logistical business to foreign investment and \nallowing greater competition.  In November 2001, the Government issued the  \u201cProvisions on \nForeign Investment in the PRC\u2019s Road Transport\u201d regulation, which was designed to streamline \napproval procedures for foreign investments, define the scope for foreign investments, and \nclarify issues regarding post-investment changes. By the end of 2001, foreign investment had \nbeen made in 820 passenger service, freight service, and logistics and maintenance service \ncompanies mostly in coastal areas, such as Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Guangdong. Despite these \nachievements, there remain many challenges, including a lack of transparency and inadequate \nenforcement  of  regulations  so  that  foreign  companies  can  fully  take  advantage  of  the \nopportunities offered by the PRC\u2019s WTO accession. \n \n8.  ADB's operating strategy4 in the PRC\u2019s road sector is designed to remove infrastructure \nconstraints and support policy and institutional reforms. Since 1991, ADB has provided 27 loans \ntotaling $4.8 billion to help finance 3,555 km of highway development and improvement of an \nassociated  local  road  network.  ADB  road  projects  are  generally  being  implemented \nsatisfactorily.  ADB  has  provided  21  advisory  TAs  totaling  $12.9  million  to  support  the \ndevelopment  of  road  infrastructure  by  addressing  policy  and  institutional  issues,  including \nhighway  planning,  road  safety,  human  resource  development,  transport  pricing, \ncommercialization  and  corporatization  of  enterprises,  and  mobilization  of  nongovernment \nfinancial  resources,  and  to  analyze  the  impact  of  better  roads  in  social  development \nimprovements. ADB  provided a TA5 in 1993 to help identify ways of  raising road transport \nefficiency by improving the utilization of resources; increasing the market orientation of the \nindustry; eliminating barriers to increased private sector participation, including foreign direct \ninvestment; and removing regulatory and institutional constraints on efficient operation. While \nthe TA achieved the envisaged objectives to a certain degree, its impact was constrained due to \nthe limited responsibility of the selected executing agency and a lack of internal coordination \nwithin the concerned government agency.6 As a result, the TA was rated partially successful. \nBecause of these lessons learned of experience, the executing agency for this TA was carefully \nselected and the importance of coordination among relevant departments was discussed during \nfact-finding. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The purpose of the TA is to help the Government improve the performance of the road \ntransport industry by formulating and implementing policy reforms in  the road freight and \npassenger industries. The main output of the TA will be a realistic road transport reform action \nplan and assistance in implementing the action plan.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  To  achieve  the  purpose  and  deliver  outputs,  the  TA  will (i) review the policy and \nregulatory  framework  in  the  road  transport  industry;  (ii)  examine  the  factors  affecting  the \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2001.

Key \nactivities  include  reviewing  relevant  reports  and  documents,  stakeholder  discussions, \nconducting  field  surveys  in  selected  provinces,  and  training  and  seminars  to  disseminate \nfindings of the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $630,000 equivalent, consisting of $324,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $306,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent covering the entire foreign exchange costs and \n$176,000 equivalent of local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTA  funding  program.  The  Government  will  finance  the  balance  of  the  local  currency  cost, \nequivalent to  $130,000, through the provision of  counterpart staff, office facilities, and other \nsupport services. Detailed cost estimates are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The Ministry of Communications (MOC)  will be the Executing Agency, and will appoint \nsuitable counterpart staff who will be responsible for supervising and coordinating the TA \nactivities on a day-to-day basis, including monitoring progress; assisting in resolving issues that \nmay  arise  during  TA  implementation;  assisting  in  arranging  meetings;  and  liaising  with \nGovernment agencies concerned, including the Ministry of Finance, the National Development \nand Reform Commission, and the Ministry of Public Security. Policy guidance to the consultants \nwill be provided by MOC and other ministries, as appropriate, which will meet to discuss the \nconsultant\u2019s report at the inception, interim, and draft final stages. The consultants are expected \nto be fielded in September 2004, and their work will be carried out over about 6 months with \ncompletion in March 2005.  Limited office equipment will be procured under the consultants \ncontract  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  and  ownership  will  be \ntransferred to the Government after TA completion. The consultants will maintain close contact \nwith MOC and inform them of the progress of their work and findings.  Workshops involving \nMOC and other government offices, ADB, and the consultants will be held in the PRC to review \nthe findings of the consultants, and the main findings will be disseminated through publication. A \ndraft outline of the final report is in Appendix 3. \n \n13.  A team of international consulting firms in association with domestic consultants will be \nselected and engaged by ADB using the simplified technical proposal procedures based on the \nquality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic \nconsultants. The TA will require 10 person-months of international and  18 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services to carry out  the study. The international consultants will have \nexpertise in the following fields: (i) transport policy and regulation, (ii) road passenger transport, \nand (iii) road freight transport. The international consultants will be encouraged to use domestic \nconsultants, who will have expterise in (i) transport policy and regulations, (ii) transport economics, \n(iii) road passenger transport, and (iv) road freight transport.

Review existing reports on the road transport industry in the People\u2019s Republic of China \nto  examine  the  progress  of  reform  in  the  industry.  In  particular,  examine  the  status  of \nimplementation of the relevant recommendations made under an  Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  improving  efficiency  in  the  road  transport1 and other \nrelevant reports2 including a broad study on transport sector reform being carried out by the \nMinistry of Communications (MOC).  \n \nB.  Road Transport Policy and Regulation \n2.  The consultant will do the following: (i) Review the road transport policies affecting both \nfreight and passenger transport in the context of broader policies concerning road infrastructure \nand other transport modes, including the multimodal transport of containers. (ii) Define the \noverall objectives and responsibilities for policy-making and implementation,  the roles of the \ngovernment and private sector in road transport, and the basis for road transport regulations to \npromote efficient use of roads  and vehicle fleets  and to promote  safety and  environmental \nprotection.  The  policy  framework  should  endorse  the  primary  role  of  market  forces  in \ndetermining price and service levels with the role of the  Government limited to ensuring that \ncompetitive conditions prevail and that safety and environmental considerations are met. \n \n3.  The consultant will assess the regulatory framework to identify  aspects that are not \nconsistent with the regulatory objectives and to define the need for alternative regulations. The \nscope of regulations should cover (i) definition of the road transport system, (ii) goals and \nobjectives of the regulations, (iii) role of the various levels of government, (iv) scope of the road \ntransport  development  tasks  and  the  role  of  central  and  local  regulatory  agencies,  (v) \ndevelopment of effective trucking and heavy vehicle industry, and (vi) coordination between the \nconcerned  government  ministries  and  departments.  The  provision  of  subsidies  and  cargo \ninsurance, and market entry conditions and national treatment of foreign-owned passenger and \nfreight companies will also be reviewed. \n \n4.  The review of the regulatory framework will emphasize the following three areas, among \nothers: (i) road traffic; (ii) vehicle, including off-road (farm) vehicles, and driver licensing; and (iii) \nroad transport licensing and management. For the road traffic, review the following aspects: \nadministrative responsibilities; general rules of behavior; status of signs and signals; rules for \nproper movement of traffic; speed limits; responsibility of motor vehicle operators; rights and \nduties of pedestrians; special rules for cyclists and motor cyclists; proper use of motor vehicle \nequipment, road signs, signals, and markings; authorities to investigate traffic violations  and \ntraffic accidents, traffic accident reporting and information system; penalty provisions; and use \nof  seat  belts  and  the  desirability  of  the  use  of  car  seats  for  infants.  Regulatory  issues \nsurrounding nonmotorized transport will also be reviewed. \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1993.

For vehicle and driver licensing, assess the following aspects: vehicle equipment and \nregistration, vehicle sizes (including over-dimension vehicles), weights and proper equipping of \nseat belts, and driver licensing. For road transport operator licensing, review administration of \noperator  licenses;  refusal,  suspension  and  revocation  of  licenses;  license  fees;  appeal \nprocedures; planning of routes and terminals;  control  of  terminals; monitoring of services; \nreporting of offences; enforcement of license regulations; penalty provisions; and the system to \nmonitor the payment of fines. The possibility of providing bus stops on the expressways (main \nlane,  rest  areas,  and  interchanges)  will  be  examined  and  changes  to  the  regulations \nrecommended, if needed. \n \n6.  Review the regulatory changes3 since December 2001 in line with commitments in the \nWorld Trade Organization  (WTO) accession agreement  to open the  freight and passenger \nmarkets to foreign investment in road transport, vehicle maintenance and repairing services, \nand transport-related services such as storage and warehousing. \n \n7.  Review the institutional framework and capacity for formulating and implementing the \npolicy and regulations at the central and local government levels. \n \nC.  Road Transport Operations \n8.  The consultant will analyze the structure and operational performance of the freight and \npassenger transport industries with due consideration to types of ownership, size of companies, \ntypes of license (grades I to V), vehicle fleet, types and quality of services offered, load factors, \nvehicle utilization, financial positions, expressway toll rates, vehicle emissions, safety features, \nand accident costs. \n \n9.  To identify the factors affecting operating costs and level of service in the trucking \nindustry, examine the operating costs (variable costs and fixed costs) incurred under each item \nin relation to prevailing input prices. Analyze the operating cost per ton-kilometer (km), fuel \nconsumption, and the number of staff per truck. \n \n10.  Measure the relevant performance indicators in relation to those expected for efficient \noperations based on best international practice. Vehicle use (vehicle-kilometer per year) may be \naffected by road conditions due to inadequate maintenance,  use of  obsolete or technically \ninferior vehicles, poor driving behavior and maintenance, and operating practices or regulatory \nconstraints, which limit operating hours. Vehicle use may also be affected by restrictions on \nworking  hours  (for  example  due  to  regulations  or  safety  reasons),  seasonal  variations  in \ndemand, vehicle availability, average loads, and level of service. \n \n11.  Analyze problems affecting performance and their effects. In addition to the factors listed \nin para. 10, examine the following: (i) the average ratio of trucks per operator, indicating the \nownership structure of the industry; (ii) the proportion of traffic carried by own-account trucking, \nindicating important characteristics of the industry and the way it might be regulated; (iii) the \nextent of specialization in trucking, indicating the level of development in transport businesses \nand services; (iv) logistics systems; and (v) provision of cargo insurance. \n \n                                                 \n3 MOC and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. 2001, 20 November. Provisions on Foreign \nInvestment in China\u2019s Road Transport. ", "12 Appendix 4 \n12.  Examine the cost breakdown of bus services in a similar way as for the trucking industry. \nIn  doing  so,  take  into  account  the  possibility  of  fare  subsidy  and  cross-subsidies  among \noperating routes. \n \n13.  Measure the relevant performance indicators compared to best international practices \nfor efficient operation. Vehicle utilization (bus-kilometer per year) may be affected by road \nconditions, which may limit speeds; unreliable buses, which often break down; and lack of \nefficient  scheduling.  The  level  of  service  of  bus  operation  may  be  expressed  as  follows: \npassenger travel times, predictability of departure and arrival times, the rate of bus breakdowns, \navailability of special features (comfortable chairs, air conditioning, toilets, etc), and passenger \nfacilities at bus stations. \n \n14.  Analyze problems affecting bus performance and their effects. In addition to the factors \nlisted in para. 13, examine the following: (i) travel patterns, (ii) lack of timetables for bus services, \n(iii) lack of passenger choice over type of service and operators, (iv) lack of private sector bus \noperators on route services, and (v) lack of bus stations along the expressways. \n \n15.  Review the actual and expected impact of the WTO accession on the structure and \nperformance of the road transport industry. Review the need to establish a mechanism to \nfacilitate public and private consultation at national and provincial levels to promote private \nsector participation in the road transport. \n \n16.  To investigate the regulations and cost and quality of road transport services (including \nfreight forwarders, booking agents, and insurance companies in case of freight service), carry \nout a stakeholder analysis in two or three provincial level case studies. The case studies will \ncover both domestic and foreign operations. The provinces will be selected in consultation with \nMOC and ADB. Preference will be given to selecting provinces in which ADB has significant \nroad sector operations. \n \n17.  The following type of surveys will be carried out under the case studies: (i) roadside \ncounts and interviews to obtain  information about characteristics of supply and demand; (ii) \ninterviews of transport operators, consignors, and freight forwarders to find out customer level of \nservice and charges; (iii) analysis of operating records showing revenue and expenditure with \nsupporting  statistics  like  vehicle-kilometer  operated  and  fuel  consumed;  (iv)  interviews  of \ninformal operators in operational centers to identity important issues and concerns of transport \noperators; and (v) analysis of records of transport data to analyze changes in the industry and to \nidentify traffic trends and possible effects of past regulatory changes. \n \n18.  Develop a set of performance indicators to measure the efficiency of the road transport \nindustry, and define the baseline and targets with a timeframe. \n \nD.  Road Transport Policy Reform Action Plan \n19.  Based on the foregoing, identify the policy and regulatory framework, and ownership and \noperating characteristics that constrain the performance of the road transport industry, and \npropose improvements to increase operating efficiency, including private participation in the \nindustry. A set of proposed actions as agreed with MOC will be included in the road transport \npolicy  reform  action  plan,  indicating  the  current  situation,  proposed  actions,  performance \nindicators (baseline and targets) with a time frame, and responsible agency. \n ", "Appendix 4  13\n20.  Review lessons learned from other countries in policy and regulations, and industrial \nstructure and performance. Such countries may include Australia, India, and the United States, \nsubject to confirmation by  MOC. As part of this  exercise, prepare an overseas training for \ngovernment officials concerned. The training program and a list of participants will require ADB \napproval. \n \n21.  Organize two workshops to discuss among various stakeholders the findings of the \nprovincial level case studies, and disseminate the outcome of the work at the time of the draft \nfinal report. A final report will be edited for publication (bilingual) and a broad based information \ndissemination strategy will be developed. \n \nE.  Reporting Requirements \n22.  The consultants will submit the following reports:  (i) an inception report 4 weeks after \ncommencement of services; (ii) an interim report after 10 weeks, (iii) a draft final report after 17 \nweeks; and (iii) a final report after 24 weeks. MOC requires five copies of each report in English \nand Chinese while the following Government  offices need two copies of each report in the \nEnglish and Chinese languages: Ministry of Finance (TA Division), National Development and \nReform Commission, and Ministry of Public Security. ADB requires five copies of each report in \nEnglish. The final report will be edited for publication (bilingual). All reports will be submitted in \nboth hard copy and soft copy. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20040707085012+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20040628141924Z", "Title": "TA text _final_.doc", "Creator": "TA text (final).doc - Microsoft Word", "Author": "ADB", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT"}}
