The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has  asked  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) in providing emergency response to the \nSichuan earthquake. A videoconference was held on 19 May 2008 to discuss and reach an \nunderstanding with the Government on the TA objectives, scope, terms of reference, cost \nestimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements. The TA is provided in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy1 with additional TA resources to the \nresources already included in the TA program of ADB 2008 country program for the PRC.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  On 12 May 2008, a massive earthquake measuring 8.0 on the Richter scale3 struck \nsouthwest  PRC.  The  earthquake\u2019s  epicenter  was  in  Wenchuan  county,  Aba  prefecture, \n80 kilometers  (km)  west\u2013northwest  of  Chengdu,  the  capital  of  Sichuan  province.  The \nearthquake was the result of movement on a northeast striking reverse fault, or thrust fault, on \nthe northwestern margin of the Sichuan Basin. The earthquake caused serious damage in \nnearby counties and cities, and was felt in Beijing (1,500 km away) and Shanghai (1,900 km \naway). Within 72 hours of the main tremor, 52 major aftershocks, ranging in magnitude from \n4.4 to 6.0, were recorded. \n \n3.  The quake caused major loss of life and property. As of 21 May 2008, 41,353 deaths \nand 274,683 injuries had been reported, and about 4.8 million people were homeless. In the \ntown of Yingxiu, only 2,300 of a population of about 9,000 survived. In Beichuan county, 3,000\u2013\n5,000 people were killed, 10,000 were injured, and 80% of the buildings were destroyed. All of \nthe  highways  into  Wenchuan  (and  others  throughout  Sichuan  province)  were  damaged, \ndelaying  rescue  activities.  In  the  city  of  Shifang,  some  80  tons  of  liquid  ammonia  leaked \nfollowing the collapse of two chemical plants, which reportedly buried hundreds of people. About \n7,000  schools  were  seriously  affected\u2014some  collapsed,  others  were  seriously  damaged, \nresulting in the deaths of many young children and teachers. Many teenagers were buried in the \ncollapse of Juyuan middle school. Another school collapsed in the city of Dujiangyan, southeast \nof the epicenter, burying 900 students under the rubble. It was one of eight schools toppled in \nDujiangyan.  The  city  is  also  home  to  the  Dujiangyan  irrigation  system,  an  ancient  water \ndiversion project that is still in use and has been designated a World Heritage site by the United \nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The project's famous Fish \nMouth was cracked, but otherwise was not severely damaged. The aftershocks and land slides \nhave resulted in further loss of life and property. \n \n4.  Telecommunications were badly affected\u2014half the wireless communication in Sichuan \nprovince was lost, and telecommunication service in Wenchuan and four nearby counties was \ncut off. China Mobile, the country\u2019s largest telecommunications service provider, suspended \n2,300 base stations because of power disruption or severe network congestion. The Zipingpu \nhydropower plant 20 km east of the epicenter was destroyed, and about 2,000 troops were sent \nto Zipingpu to try to release the pressure through the spillway. The dam has severe cracks, and \nthe  plant  and  associated  buildings  have  collapsed;  some  have  partly  sunk.  The  Tulong \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 May 2008. \n3  As measured by China Seismological Bureau. \n ", "2 \nreservoir, which is upstream, is in danger of collapse. In total, 391 dams, most of them small, \nwere reported damaged by the quake.4 Persistent heavy rain and landslides in earthquake-\naffected areas badly hampered rescue efforts. \n \n5.  The earthquake is the worst natural disaster to affect the PRC in the past 30 years.5 The \nestimated damage from the earthquake is expected to exceed $20 billion. The Government \nreacted rapidly and with openness to deal with the disaster. It has taken steps to mitigate the \ndisaster  at  the  highest  level.  The  State  Disaster  Relief  Commission  initiated  a  \u201clevel  I\u201d \nemergency contingency plan, which covers the most serious class of natural disasters. The \nPrime Minister has been personally directing the relief operations in the Sichuan province. \nEmergency medical teams, relief teams, fire rescue teams, the army, and police force have \nbeen engaged in the rescue and relief operations across 58 counties and cities. \n \n6.  The  PRC  has  requested  the  support  of  nongovernment  organizations  and  the \ninternational community to respond to the needs of the affected families. Foreign nations and \norganizations immediately responded to the disaster by offering condolences and assistance. \nThe Red Cross Society of China is involved in the relief work and flew in 557 tents and \n2,500 quilts valued at CNY788,000 to Wenchuan county. The Sichuan Department of Civil \nAffairs provided 30,000 tents for those left homeless. On 16 May 2008, rescue groups from the \nRepublic of Korea, Japan, and Singapore among others arrived to join the rescue effort. The \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) procured $430,000 worth of emergency supplies, \nincluding 1,000 tents, 15,000 blankets, and 60,000 school kits. Some charities have come \nforward  to  provide  humanitarian  assistance  and  support.  By  16  May  2008,  the  PRC  had \nreceived $457 million in donated money and goods for rescue efforts, including $83 million from \n19 countries and 4 international organizations. The Government had allocated $772 million for \nearthquake relief by 16 May 2008. The Ministry of Civil Affairs (MCA) noted that the Chinese \npublic had donated CNY10.7 billion. Multinational firms located in the PRC also announced \nlarge donations. The International Federation of the Red Cross praised the PRC's rescue effort \nas swift and very efficient. \n \n7.  ADB, a development partner of the PRC since 1986, has provided substantial support \nfor the development of the poor central and western regions of the country. Sichuan province is \na relatively poor province in southwest PRC. The untimely calamity has exacerbated poverty \nand  vulnerability  in  the  province.  ADB  expressed  condolences  and  offered  support  for \nreconstruction and rehabilitation. On 19 May 2008, the Government requested ADB\u2018s support \nfor TA to address the immediate short-term requirements in the aftermath of the earthquake. \nThe Government advised that it is completing the relief program and requested support for \n(i) initiating time-sensitive, critical components of early recovery assistance programs to restore \nbasic  services  and  provide  support  to  the  affected  people  during  the  transition  period; \n(ii) reviewing national, provincial, and local disaster management frameworks with reference to \nthe  Sichuan  earthquake,  including  providing  capacity  building  support  for  emergency \nmanagement; and (iii) conducting a preliminary damage and needs assessment of the physical \nand social infrastructure based on the Government\u2019s ongoing damage and needs assessment, \nsome of which ADB could support by providing subsequent restoration programs or projects.   \n                                                 \n4 The Government has initiated an urgent assessment and rehabilitation of damage to the dams.  \n5 On 28 July 1976, about 240,000 people died in an earthquake that hit Tangshan county in Hebei province. \n ", "    3 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the proposed TA is to support the Government\u2019s emergency response to \nthe Sichuan earthquake. The outcome of the TA will be to complement and/or support the \nGovernment\u2019s initial rehabilitation and restoration efforts in the earthquake-affected area. The \nTA will (i) provide support to the affected people during the transition period by acquiring \nessential equipment and supplies for basic services, as requested by the MCA; (ii) review the \ndisaster management framework with reference to the Sichuan earthquake, and identify the key \nareas that need attention; and (iii) conduct a preliminary damage and needs assessment of the \nphysical and social infrastructure based on the Government\u2019s ongoing damage and needs \nassessment,  some  of  which  ADB  could  support  by  providing  subsequent  reconstruction \nprograms or projects. The TA may provide local capacity development support for managing \nand mitigating the impacts of the earthquake.  \n \n9.  The  TA  is  guided  by  the  principles  of  timeliness  and  effectiveness.  Flexibility  is \nincorporated in the design and implementation arrangements to enable an immediate response \nto  the  substantial  uncertainties  and  risks  associated  with  such  a  major  disaster.  It  will \nemphasize quick action to protect the poor, children, vulnerable, and other at-risk groups. The \nTA  will  be  implemented  in  close  collaboration  with  the  MCA,  the  agency  handling  the \nrehabilitation and restoration of the earthquake victims. Close collaboration with other domestic \nand international partners will be maintained, and the outputs and the lessons will be shared. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The  TA  is  designed  to  augment  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  (i)  provide  immediate \nsupport to the vulnerable, (ii) review and provide recommendations on the disaster management \nsystem  with  reference  to  managing  and  mitigating  the  immediate  impacts  of  the  Sichuan \nearthquake, and (iii) conduct a preliminary damage and needs assessment of the impacts of the \nearthquake. In light of the impacts of the earthquake that are still unfolding, and the resource \nconstraints  confronting  the  restoration  and  rehabilitation  efforts,  the  MCA  will  initiate  time-\nsensitive, critical components of early recovery programs under the first component of the TA to \nprovide immediate support to the vulnerable. This will include acquiring essential equipment and \nsupplies  for  basic  services,  and  preparing  a  package  of  urgently  needed  equipment  and \nmaterials to be procured to support the affected people during the transition period.  \n \n11.  For the second component, the TA will review the national, provincial, and local disaster \nmanagement frameworks with reference to the Sichuan earthquake, particularly in relation to \nthe guidelines provided as part of the National Plan for Comprehensive Disaster Reduction \nduring the 11th Five-Year Plan of the PRC promulgated in August 2007. The TA will identify the \nareas that need attention to manage and mitigate the impacts of the disaster.6 The TA will assist \nin compiling the issues for effective and comprehensive emergency response plans, covering \ncoordination  in  key  areas  that  require  collaboration  among  national,  provincial,  and  local \n                                                 \n6 The results of this component would feed into the proposed TA support for a national disaster management study, \nwhich is proposed to be supported by ADB and included in the 2008 TA program. ", "4 \ngovernments,  and  will  evaluate  the  efficacy  of  the  mechanisms  for  immediate  action  and \ndisaster management. Within the available limited resources, the TA will provide urgent capacity \ndevelopment support through knowledge transfer for emergency management.  \n \n12.  For  the  third  component,  the  TA  will  conduct  a  preliminary  damage  and  needs \nassessment  of  the  physical  and  social  infrastructure  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing \ndamage and needs assessment. The aim will be to improve understanding of the impacts, some \nof  which  ADB  could  address  by  providing  subsequent  emergency  assistance  program  or \nprojects. This assessment will be based on the data and information available from the working \ngroups set up by the Government and coordinated by the National Development and Reform \nCommission  (NDRC),  the  provincial  government,  and  other  sources.  The  consultants  will \n(i) evaluate the damage caused by the earthquake, (ii) assess the priority actions and prioritize \nthe  needs  to  restore  and  rehabilitate  the  damage,  and  (iii)  recommend  possible  future \nassistance by ADB in reconstruction programs and projects. The outline terms of reference is in \nAppendix 3. \n  \n13.  The TA will be undertaken in close consultation with the Government, MCA, and other \nrelevant agencies. Key activities will include (i) a review of available information on the disaster, \nexisting studies and/or assessments by NDRC, working groups set up by the Government, other \nmultilateral  institutions,  and  other  agencies;  (ii)  data  analysis;  and  (iii)  consultation  with \nbeneficiaries and other stakeholders. Workshops, one each at inception and final report stages \nof TA implementation, will be organized to discuss and review the TA findings.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,250,000 equivalent. ADB\u2019s TA funding program will \nfinance $1,000,000 of the TA on a grant basis. The Government will finance the remainder, \nequivalent  to  $250,000,  which  will  cover  office  accommodation  and  the  counterpart  staff \nrequired to implement the TA. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  As the Executing Agency, the MCA will be responsible for supervising and monitoring TA \nactivities. Joint MCA-Ministry of Finance guidance will ensure that the TA and other domestic \nand  foreign-assisted  initiatives  are  consistent  and  complement  each  other.  A  project \nimplementation unit in MCA will (i) propose to ADB an emergency package of urgently needed \nequipment and materials to be procured to support the affected people during the transition \nperiod; and (ii) allocate resources and materials for the review of the disaster management \nframework and the damaged-needs assessment, which ADB can support across provinces. The \nproject implementation unit will oversee day-to-day implementation, ensure coordination with \ndifferent agencies and other relevant organizations, and facilitate sharing of information and \nlessons. \n \n16.  Given the uncertainties in the evolution of earthquake impacts, as well as in national and \nexternal resource mobilization, implementation will be flexible. Timely inputs will be tailored to \nperiodically assessed needs. Expertise, equipment, and supplies will be provided within the \nframework  of  Government  and  external  responses,  balancing  the  following:  (i)  efficiency; \n(ii) responsiveness to province-specific needs; and (iii) information sharing, capacity for quick \nconcerted action, and optimal use of limited resources. \n ", "    5 \n17.  TA implementation arrangements will provide flexibility to allow adjustment in the terms \nof reference of consultants, duration, and schedule of expert inputs. ADB will recruit a national \nconsultant who will work as the TA coordinator and assist the MCA with timely procurement. \nThe consultant also will supervise and coordinate day-to-day TA activities, including monitoring \nprogress, resolving problems, arranging meetings, and liaising with the government agencies \nconcerned. The  TA  coordinator  will  submit  monthly  reports  to  ADB on  TA  implementation \nprogress.  For  implementing  the  second  and  third  components,  one  international  and  two \nnational consultants with expertise in disaster management and disaster impact assessment will \nbe recruited. Consultants will be engaged as individuals, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of international and national consultants. In dialogue \nwith the MCA, ADB may consider direct selection of qualified domestic and/or international \norganizations, local institutions, and/or short-term resource persons, where justified by efficacy, \nefficiency, and/or urgency in completing activities. To facilitate the work of the consultants, and \nto  ensure  that  the  MCA  benefits  from  their  experience,  the  MCA  will  provide  adequate \ncounterpart staff with relevant work experience during TA implementation. The MCA will also \nprovide policy guidance to the consultants. Workshops will be held to review findings at the \ninception, and final stages of the TA. These meetings will include representatives of MCA, \nMinistry of Finance, NDRC, other relevant agencies, ADB, and the consultants. \n \n18.  To respond quickly to urgent and evolving needs, procurement of goods will incorporate \ngreater flexibility. Unless otherwise agreed upon by ADB, the PIU will procure all goods in \naccordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). To \nexpedite delivery, shopping and national competitive bidding with abbreviated bidding periods \nwill be applied, as considered appropriate, to procure the agreed-upon emergency package. To \nensure timely provision of goods and services, an advance payment facility will be established \nin accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Disbursement of Technical Assistance Grants, and \nsubject to terms laid out in the letter establishing the facility. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented from May 2008 to October 2008. In view of the nature of the \ndisaster and the evolution of the impacts, TA reviews will carefully assess implementation \narrangements and approaches, and appropriate adjustments will be instituted. \n \nIII.

The preliminary assessment will cover housing, \nschools,  hospitals,  roads,  railways,  communication  and  power  facilities,  dams  and  water \nresources facilities, flood-control facilities, farms, other related infrastructure and facilities, and \nlivelihoods and agricultural services. The aim will be to improve understanding of the impacts, \nsome of which ADB could address by providing subsequent emergency assistance program or \nprojects. The needs assessment will be based on the following guiding principles: (i) rapidly \nrebuilding of people\u2019s livelihoods; (ii) ensuring independence and self-sufficiency to maximize \nthe use of local initiative, resources, and capacities; (iii) focusing on the most vulnerable and \nsocially  disadvantaged  groups,  such  as  children,  women,  and  the  disabled;  (iv)  securing \ndevelopment gains and progress in poverty reduction; (v) restoring capacities to manage the \nrecovery  process;  (vi)  avoiding  the  creation  of  new  disaster  risks;  (vii)  encouraging  the \nengagement of private sector and civil society; and (viii) pursuing coordinated and coherent \napproaches to recovery. The methodology used will evaluate the direct damage, indirect losses, \nand reconstruction costs for each sector. This assessment will be done based on the data and \ninformation available from the working groups set up by the Government and coordinated by \nNDRC, the provincial government, and other sources. The consultants will (i) evaluate the \ndamage caused by the earthquake, (ii) assess the priority actions and prioritize the needs to \nrestore and rehabilitate the damage, and (iii) recommend possible future assistance by ADB in \nreconstruction programs and projects.  \n \n7.  The consultants will organize workshops at the inception and final report stages of the \nTA to discuss the findings and outputs. \n \nC.  Reporting Requirements  \n \n8.  The consultants will submit the following reports: (i) an inception report 2 weeks after \nservices begin, (ii) a draft final report after 12 weeks, and (iii) a final report (including key \nfindings and recommendations) after 4 months. The MCA requires five copies of each report in \nEnglish and Chinese, while the Ministry of Finance needs two copies of each report in English \nand Chinese. ADB requires five copies of each report in English. All reports will be submitted in \nhard copy and soft copy.   \n                                                 \n1 The results of this component would feed into the proposed TA support for national disaster management study, \nwhich is proposed to be supported by ADB and included in the 2008 TA program. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080526151959+08'00'", "Author": "LPC", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "sichuan earthquake emergency response, disaster and emergency assistance, disaster management framework, adb ta 7081, adb project 42150", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0.5 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20080602162345+08'00'", "Title": "Providing Emergency Response to Sichuan Earthquake"}}
