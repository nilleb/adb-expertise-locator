INTRODUCTION  \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support Neijiang, a city in \nSichuan Province in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), in improving social governance by \nstrengthening liability insurance policy. The proposed TA will provide comprehensive analysis and \nspecific policy recommendations for Neijiang to enlarge the role of liability insurance in mitigating \nsocioeconomic risks, including that of social unrest. \n  \n2.  The Government of the PRC requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide TA \nto support Neijiang in developing innovative liability insurance products and using these new \nproducts to improve social governance and harmony. The TA will aim to replicate Neijiang\u2019s \nexperience in other cities in the PRC. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business \nplan, 2017\u20132019 for the PRC.1 \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Neijiang is a city in Sichuan, located in the southwest PRC, with a territory of 5,385 square \nkilometers and 4.2 million inhabitants. Neijiang\u2019s economy is dominated by agriculture and \ntraditional manufacturing (e.g., machinery and steel), with a relatively small service sector. In 2016, \nits per capita gross domestic product was CNY34,667, well below the provincial average of \nCNY39,695 and the national average of CNY53,980.2  \n \n4.  The vast territory, large population, and less-developed economy challenge Neijiang\u2019s \nsocial governance system. In 2016, there were 3,768 civil liability lawsuits filed in Neijiang, \nincluding for health damages from polluted air, water, or soil; unsuccessful medical treatments; \nand property (including land) infringements. Since many people tend to resort to violence to \ndefend  their  interests  instead  of  using  peaceful,  legal  procedures,  many  other  social \nconfrontations were resolved or left unresolved outside normal legal channels. Unresolved cases \ncould  become  a  new  source  for  confrontations.  Correctly  handling  such  confrontations, \nparticularly those involving illegal actions and/or vulnerable people, has become a key concern \nfor the city government. \n \n5.  The traditional social conflict resolution mechanism, which relied on national government \nto handle social confrontations and maintain social stability, was inherited from the central \nplanning system and was used from the start of reform and opening-up in 1978 until 2013. \nWhenever there was a social confrontation, the national government was responsible to keep the \nsituation under control and then help the stakeholders in finding an acceptable solution, including \nnegotiating an agreement on financial compensation. This traditional social conflict resolution \nmechanism worked well in the planning era before 1978, when the government predominantly \nmanaged social affairs, and it still worked during the early stage of reforms, when the market \nstarted playing a role in socioeconomic development. However, in recent years, the government \nhas discovered that stakeholders are more likely to over claim financial compensation and \ndisagree about who bears the onus of liability. \n \n6.  Social governance is a term that has frequently appeared in PRC policy documents since \nthe Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of the PRC \nadopted the Decisions on Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening Reforms in \nNovember 2013. The decisions were seen widely as a cornerstone policy document that set the \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: PRC, 2017\u20132019. Manila. The TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 August 2017. \n2  China Statistics Publishing House. 2017. Neijiang Statistics Yearbook 2017. Neijiang.  \n ", "2 \ntone for future reforms. The decisions called for an innovative social governance arrangements, \nincluding (i) innovative ways of handling social affairs; (ii) all stakeholders, including government \nagencies, social corporations, nonprofit organizations, and individuals, playing a role in managing \nsocial affairs; (iii) an efficient and effective mechanism for preventing and resolving social disputes; \nand (iv) a sound and well-functioning social safety net.  \n \n7.  The Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 reemphasizes the importance of  innovative \nsocial governance arrangements and sets out principles for strengthening and reforming the \nsystem. 3 The plan calls for establishing and strengthening, among other things, (i) an effective \nand efficient mechanism for expression, coordination, and protection of individual interests to \nsolve or de-escalate conflicts; (ii) a social risk evaluation system for significant decision-making \nto minimize social impact; and (iii) an emergency management system to safeguard individual \ninterests and sustainable development. \n \n8.  Following the above-mentioned instructions for correctly handling social affairs or social \nconflicts through innovative social governance arrangements, Neijiang plans to expand liability \ninsurance to help address social conflicts and public emergencies by improving the policy and \nregulatory environment. Specifically, Neijiang plans to develop innovative liability insurance \nproducts to mitigate the impact of social unrest or de-escalate conflicts in the areas of air and \nwater pollution, soil contamination, land transactions, and goods and services with potentially high \nrisk (e.g., pharmaceuticals and medical devices, asbestos, tobacco, recreational equipment, \nmechanical  and  electrical  products,  chemicals  and  pesticides,  agricultural  products  and \nequipment, and food).     \n \n9.  Liability insurance is any insurance policy that protects individuals or businesses from the \nrisk of being sued and held legally liable for something such as malpractice, injury, or negligence. \nLiability insurance policies cover both legal costs and any legal payouts for which the insured \nwould be responsible if found legally liable. Intentional damage and contractual liabilities are \ntypically not covered in these types of policies. They are designed to offer specific protection \nagainst third-party insurance claims. Payment is not typically made to the insured, but rather to \nsomeone suffering loss who is not a party to the insurance contract. When a claim is made, the \ninsurance carrier has the duty (and right) to defend the insured. \n \n10.  In many developed countries, liability insurance is a compulsory form of insurance that an \nindividual or business is legally required to buy against the risk of being sued by third parties. The \nmost  common  classes  of  mandatory  insurance  cover  automobile  drivers,  those  who  offer \nprofessional services to the public, those who manufacture products that may be harmful, those \nwho provide employment, and construction companies. Such laws were enacted to safeguard the \npublic from the classes of insured who are deliberately engaging in activities that put others at \nrisk of injury or loss. Public policy requires that such individuals carry insurance so that if their \nactions cause loss or damage to another, money will be available to pay compensation. However, \ncompulsory insurance requirements are not always easy to enforce. \n \n11.  The  PRC  is  already  the  third  largest  commercial  insurance  market  globally,4 with \npremiums of CNY 3.1 trillion in 2016 and strong annual average growth of 13.5% since 20115. \nGrowth has been driven by increasing risk awareness and regulatory changes. However, its \n                                                \n3  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2016.

World Insurance In 2016: The China Growth Engine Steams Ahead. Zurich. \n5  China Insurance Regulatory Commission. 2017. Insurance Statistics Report 2016.  Beijing. \n   ", "3 \npenetration rate of liability insurance remains low, with premiums accounting for only 0.05% of \ngross domestic product in 2016, compared to 0.50% in the United States and 0.16%\u20130.25% in \ncontinental Europe.6 Neijiang's liability penetration rate is 0.03% in 2016, well below the national \naverage.7 \n \n12.  Expanding liability insurance to address social risks and public emergencies has become \na top priority of The City Government of Neijiang. A review published in 2016 showed that low \nawareness and lack of conducive policy and institutional arrangements are the causes for the \nunderdevelopment of liability insurance.8 The advancement of the legal system and the rising \nlevels of compensation in the PRC has resulted in a more litigious legal environment. Today, the \nPRC government has limited resources but potentially has unlimited responsibilities for social \ngovernance. This mismatch of resources and responsibilities usually results in inadequate and \ndelayed financial compensation to the vulnerable. The underpayment of compensation often \nleads to violence (and other extreme remedies) by the those affected, which makes the weak \nsuffer even more. Furthermore, without an appropriate market mechanism like liability insurance, \nsocial governance could move back to the traditional conflict resolution mechanism, with very little \npublic participation and high administrative costs. As an inland prefecture city, Neijiang faces all \nthese national challenges and plans to pilot the reform of liability insurance system.   \n \n13.  The TA will assist Neijiang in constructing an overall pilot program of expanding liability \ninsurance, designing special liability insurance products, and drafting action plan for increasing \npublic awareness. Under the TA, the project team will conduct SWOT9 analysis and provide \nNeijiang with specific policy recommendations for improving policy and institutional arrangements \nconducive to the development of innovative liability insurance products. This will enable better \nmanagement  of  the  contingent  liability  of  the  city  government  for  providing  immediate \ncompensation or relief to those affected. \n \n14.  The TA project is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC \nand the Financial Sector Operational Plan.10 The TA project supports the government\u2019s goal of \nbalancing  the  role  of  the  government,  society,  and  the  market  to  deliver  inclusive  and \nenvironmentally sustainable growth through the key objectives of increasing public participation \nand allowing the market mechanism to play a decisive role in resource allocation. The TA project \nmay  also  generate  useful  findings  for  related  work  planned  on  environmental  damage \ncompensation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.

Output 1: A comprehensive report on strengthening liability insurance produced. \nThe report comprises (i) a SWOT analysis, policy recommendations for improving policy and \ninstitutional arrangements conducive to the development of innovative liability insurance products, \nand an action plan for increasing awareness of liability insurance; (ii) a review of the ongoing \nmedical liability insurance and its mediation arrangements, and policy recommendations for its \nfurther  improvement;  and  (iii)  specific  recommendations  for  establishing  a  special  liability \ninsurance  facility  that  incentivizes  take-up  of  affordable  liability  insurance  products  for \nenvironmental protection, medical treatment, food safety, and safety of electric lifts, as requested \nby the city government. This will enable better management of the contingent liability of the city \ngovernment for providing immediate compensation and/or relief to those affected. \n \n17.  Output 2: Awareness of liability insurance among stakeholders enhanced. The TA \nproject team will conduct surveys of stakeholders on their awareness of liability insurance and \nexplore options for enhancing awareness. Through the TA, the TA project team will organize \nworkshops and/or conferences to discuss opportunities and challenges faced by Neijiang in \nexpanding liability insurance, the supply and demand of liability insurance products, the possible \nrole of liability insurance in improving social governance, and the necessary improvements in \ninstitutional arrangements and the legal environment. The TA project team will disseminate its \nfindings and recommendations to employers and residents of Neijiang and other cities in Sichuan \nProvince. The outcomes of the TA can also guide reforms in other parts of the PRC. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $630,000 of which $530,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).
