INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will identify the priority actions to \nbe undertaken by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and developing member countries (DMCs) \nto mobilize investments for improving market connectivity and value chain linkages, increasing \nagricultural productivity, and enhancing rural development. It will complement another TA which \nis currently assessing the investment requirements in the agriculture sector to end hunger and \nmalnutrition in Asia and the Pacific; pilot climate-smart agriculture practices; and analyze ways to \nimprove market connectivity by establishing modern wholesale markets.1 \n \n2.  The TA supports the priorities articulated in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030,2 and ADB Management \npriorities to promote the use of high-level technology (HLT) in projects. The TA will contribute to \nADB\u2019s operational priorities in (i) accelerating progress in gender equality by building female \nfarmers\u2019 capacity, and (ii) promoting rural development and food security by increasing the \nagriculture profitability. The TA will also contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goals.3 \nThe TA is included in the 2018\u20132019 work plan of the Rural Development and Food Security \n(Agriculture) Thematic Group (RDFS TG) and the 2018 results-based work plan of  ADB\u2019s \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC).4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Hunger is on the rise again in Asia and the Pacific. In 2016, almost 520 million people in \nAsia were living with food insecurity, up from 512 million in 2015. The region is one of the lowest-\nrated regions in food security, only coming ahead of Sub-Saharan Africa.5 Asia and the Pacific \nranks third in availability but fifth in affordability, indicating problems with supply and distribution \nchains. Considering these contexts, the food demand in Asia and the Pacific is expected to \nincrease significantly with the increase in per capita income, middle-income consumers, and \npopulation growth.6 \n \n4.  However, there are major challenges facing the production and distribution of food. The \nfarm workforce is aging and decreasing, while climate change is now a formidable challenge.7 In \nfuture, fewer and older farmers, under the status quo, need to produce more food to feed the \nregion\u2019s growing population, underscoring the importance of the agricultural value and distribution \nchain. Farming must also be more profitable and farmers have to become \u201cagripreneurs\u201d to \ncontinue producing food while withstanding the emerging challenges. \n \n                                                           \n1  ADB. 2016.

Global Food Security Index 2015. The Economist. \n6  Growth of gross domestic product in Asia and the Pacific is the highest among all regions, and the number of middle-\nincome consumers is projected to increase to about 3.5 billion by 2030 (The Brookings Institution 2017. The \nunprecedented expansion of the global middle class: An update. Washington DC) and the overall population is \nexpected to increase to about 4.92 billion by 2030 (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, \nPopulation Division (2015).

As many people still face starvation in DMCs, a significant portion of agricultural produce \nis  lost  during  post-harvest  processes.  The  preliminary  findings  of  the  TA  on  Investment \nAssessment and Application of High-Level Technology for Food Security in Asia and the Pacific \n(footnote 1) indicate that the value of avoidable post-harvest losses in Bangladesh, Nepal, \nPakistan, and Viet Nam in one year is potentially higher than the investments required to develop \nmodern agri-markets and agri-infrastructure to contain these losses in the long run. A number of \nfactors hinder the development of modern agri-logistics and result in high post-harvest losses. \nInappropriate public policy and institutions deter private financing for agri-logistics. Lack of \nproduction  and  marketing  information  and  slow  information  and  communication  technology \nadoption result in high supply chain losses. These factors imply the need for modern agri-logistics, \ntechnology-driven and knowledge-intensive production as well as post-production activities. \n \n6.  The main segments along the value chain where post-harvest losses occur need to be \nidentified and analyzed. An analysis of the agricultural value chain using selected main vegetables \nto identify the core areas for intervention is needed to assess the potential increase in farmers\u2019 \nprofit due to reduced post-harvest losses. The findings will enable governments to realize the \nbenefits of investing in agri-logistics and market infrastructure to improve the value chain. The \nfindings, together with results of similar TA projects, will identify areas for private investment in \nthe value chain, minimize post-harvest losses, improve profit distribution in favor of farmers, and \nimprove food supply reliability. \n \n7.  Countries in Asia and the Pacific differ significantly in level of agriculture development. \nFarmers and policy makers from relatively lagging countries can learn from the experience of \nadvanced  countries,  such  as  the  Republic  of  Korea,  in  promoting  technology-driven  and \nknowledge-intensive  agriculture  for  rural  development.  They  can  study  the  approaches  to \nagriculture and rural development by the Republic of Korea, which are globally acclaimed.8 \nHowever, such study should consider the economic, social, and policy environment of DMCs like \nIndonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan, and the Philippines. The findings will provide insights to formulate \ncountry-specific recommendations through the application of HLT to replicate the Republic of \nKorea success. Development partners, the private sector, and other experts can also provide \nuseful  insights  to  demonstrate  how  public\u2013private  partnerships,  cofinancing,  and  social \ndevelopment initiatives can contribute to agriculture and rural development. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: agricultural profitability and rural development \nin participating DMCs enhanced.9 The TA will have the following outcome: investments in the \nmodernization of agri-logistics and rural development increased.10 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  The TA will support analytical work, study tours, and knowledge-dissemination activities \nin selected DMCs11 to identify the appropriate interventions to resolve the current problems that \n                                                           \n8  https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/30380/ewp-363.pdf \n9 ADB. 2015.

Manila. \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n11 In prioritizing DMCs for this TA, three factors will be used: (i) active agriculture and natural resources operations, \nboth ongoing and pipeline; (ii) size of the economy; and (iii) growth in urbanization and middle-income consumers. \n ", "3 \n \nhinder development of modern agri-logistics and affect value chain and rural development. It will \nsupport (i) estimation of post-harvest loss of selected main crops at different segments along the \nsupply chain, (ii) analysis of the impact of existing post-harvest loss on profitability of agriculture \nand consumer price, (iii) study of approaches to agriculture and rural development and formulation \nof customized recommendations for agricultural value-chain and rural development for selected \nDMCs based on the experiences of the Republic of Korea, (iv) a study tour of men and women \nfarmers and policy makers from selected DMCs to the Republic of Korea, and (v) dissemination \nof knowledge. \n  \n10.  Output 1: Constraints on agricultural value chain development and main areas for \ninvestment improvement identified. Analysis of the agricultural supply chain using available \nmacroeconomic data is ongoing in Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Viet Nam under the TA on \nInvestment Assessment and Application of High-Level Technology for Food Security in Asia and \nthe Pacific. The focus of this analysis is how modern wholesale markets can potentially improve \nthe efficiency of the agricultural value chain. Preliminary results, however, indicate several \nproblems exist in the midstream and downstream activities\u2014from harvesting to retailing. The TA \nwill conduct a thorough analysis of the agricultural value chain from field to market in Indonesia, \nMyanmar, Pakistan, and the Philippines by using primary data with the help of country experts. \nThe analysis will assess (i) the post-harvest loss occurring in different segments of the value chain \nsuch as harvesting, field stacking, cleaning, packaging, storage, transportation, and loading and \nunloading; (ii) farmer\u2019s profitability; (iii) the number of intermediaries involved and their share in \nthe consumer price; and (iv) the availability and quality of services like cold storage facilities, \ntransportation, and packaging. The findings of these analyses will be reviewed internally and \nshared with country stakeholders before wider dissemination. Final findings will be used to initiate \ndialogue with the governments. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Country-specific  recommendations  for  agricultural  and  rural \ndevelopment based on the experiences of the Republic of Korea for selected DMCs \nformulated.  Analysis  of  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  experience  in  agriculture  modernization, \nhorticulture value chains, and rural development will be carried out to draw lessons for selected \nDMCs.  A  consulting firm  with knowledge  on  the  Republic  of  Korea\u2019s  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment,  as  well  as  familiarity  with  the  economic,  social,  and  policy  environments  of \nIndonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan, and the Philippines, will be engaged to implement this output. The \nanalysis will include agri-logistics and infrastructure, storage facilities, and other HLT, including \ninformation and communication technology, and different rural development strategies used by \nthe Republic of Korea to promote agricultural production and rural development. The analysis will \nprovide country-specific recommendations for Indonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan, and the Philippines \nby taking their individual context into consideration to promote agriculture and rural development. \nThe findings of the analysis will be internally reviewed for quality control before presentation at a \nknowledge-sharing  event.  Final  recommendations  will  be  shared  with  the  governments  of \nrespective countries. \n \n12.  Output 3: Knowledge on agricultural value chain and rural development in selected \nDMCs improved. The TA will organize an international conference where policy makers, male \nand female farmers from the selected DMCs, development partners, private sector players, and \nexperts will share experiences and exchange ideas to strengthen the agricultural value chains, \nbuild  new  physical  and  social  infrastructure to  minimize  post-harvest losses,  and  enhance \nagricultural production and rural development. Findings of outputs 1 and 2 will be used as inputs \nand/or discussion points in the conference. A study tour to the Republic of Korea will be organized \nto facilitate cross-country learning for at least three policy makers from the participating DMCs will \nparticipate.  \n ", "4 \n13.  Output 4: Knowledge on rural development, food security, and agriculture value \nchains in Asia and the Pacific improved. The TA will organize an international forum to enable \nexperts,  policymakers,  researchers,  practitioners,  thinktanks,  and  representatives  from  key \nstakeholders to discuss global best practices, recent trends and innovations, and the use of \ninformation and communication technologies for improved rural development, market connectivity \nand agricultural value chains; increased agricultural productivity and food security; and enhanced \nfood safety. The forum will help chart the strategic direction of rural development and food security \nas one of ADB\u2019s operational priorities in Strategy 2030. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,700,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6) and (ii) $1,200,00012 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Government of the Republic of Korea through the Ministry of Agriculture, \nFood and Rural Affairs and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years, from December 2018 to December 2021. ADB \nwill administer the TA through the Agriculture, Rural Development and Food Security Unit (SDCC-\nAR) of SDCC. SDCC-AR, which is also the secretariat of the RDFS TG, will be responsible for \nthe overall supervision of the implementation. The secretariat will select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants;  organize  workshops;  and  identify  resource  persons  in  the  conference  and \nworkshops.
