INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the preparation of \nstrategic plans for the development of a comprehensive elderly care system in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) by focusing on elderly care strategy at the local level and care for the \nrural elderly. The TA will achieve this through analyses of care needs, available supply, resources \nfor service provision, institutional arrangements, international experiences, and capacity building \nof central and local governments. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the country operations business plan for the PRC, 2019\u20132021.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Family support traditionally plays a key role in providing care for elderly people in the PRC. \nFormal support has been mainly limited to social assistance, which provides in-kind support only \nfor targeted people based on social assistance criteria, or provides income support for those \nwhose incomes are below a threshold level. Therefore, the quality and type of care services have \nbeen limited since social assistance only provides a minimum level of care to the targeted elderly \npeople. \n \n4.  Rapid demographic changes in the PRC have required changes in the concept of care for \nelderly people. The traditional family support is currently unable to meet the needs for elderly care, \nwhile social assistance services cannot meet the needs of regular elderly people who are not \neligible for social assistance services. Care for people with physical and/or cognitive disabilities \ncaused  by  aging  is  needed  not  only by  people  covered  by  social  assistance.  The  elderly \npopulation, 65 years old and above, was 158 million in the PRC in 2017, accounting for 11.4% of \nthe total population.2 Elderly people need to be integrated into, rather than segregated from, \nsociety. The PRC needs to develop a comprehensive elderly care system that is able to provide \nthe scale and type of care to meet the growing needs of the elderly. Considering the sustainability \nof the elderly care system, it is important to focus on elderly people with actual care needs but \nnot elderly people who are healthy. \n \n5.  The Government of the PRC has begun to respond to the needs of its aging society. The \nTwelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 and the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 stated the \nneed to develop and support elderly care services.3 The government issued policy directions to \nsupport (i) development of the elderly care system for the PRC\u2019s aging population and private \nsector involvement in 2017,4 and (ii) further development of elderly care services in 2019.5 \nHowever, current responses to the growing needs of elderly people and their families are still \nlimited. Various demand for care services have not been clearly identified yet. Quantity and quality \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2019.

Opinions on Promoting the Development of Elderly Care Services. \nBeijing. \n ", "2 \nof care are still limited, and the number and scope of service providers are also limited. To develop \na  comprehensive  elderly  care  system  in  the  PRC,  the  keys  are  to  identify  a  local-level \ndevelopment strategy as well as possible mechanisms to make needed care accessible for rural \nelderly people. \n \n6.  It is necessary to understand the variation in the demographic, social, and elderly\u2019s \nconditions across provinces and localities in the PRC. Local governments play a key role in \nidentifying various care needs and the status of care service supply in their respective localities. \nBased on the understanding of the local status, a practical plan for the development of the elderly \ncare system needs to be established at the local level. The plan should be able to clarify the scale \nand type of care services; and determine existing and potential care service providers, possible \nfinancial resources needed for the provision of services, and needed human resources. Care \nservice providers are expected to include public institutions, nonprofit organizations, and for-profit \ncompanies. Hence, it is necessary to set up a scheme and rules to ensure that care services \nprovided by these various providers meet the appropriate quality level, and that these services \nare properly provided to elderly people who need the care. Based on the relevant guidelines set \nby the central government, local governments need to set up such a scheme and rules for service \nprovision and management. Generally, at the local level, a provincial government provides overall \nguidance on the scheme and rules to be developed in the province, and a municipal government \nprepares practical standards and implementation plans. Further, clear responsibility and risk \nalignment between the public and private sectors is a key factor to enhance the private sector\u2019s \ninvolvement in elderly care. \n \n7.  The other critical issue in developing a comprehensive elderly care system is providing \ncare for rural elderly people. While family and community support has been particularly important \nfor the rural elderly, demographic change has impacted the rural population. The traditional family \nsupport is unable to meet rural elderly care needs because of rapid urbanization and internal \nmigration of rural workers; additionally, rural migrant workers have been also rapidly aging.6 \nElderly people are more dispersed in rural areas than urban areas, making efficient care delivery \ndifficult and limiting access to needed care. Further, socioeconomic conditions of care for rural \nelderly people are diversified across regions of the PRC, but the diversified conditions have not \nbeen clarified yet. Possible financial options on the basis of different costs in delivering care \nservices need to be examined for rural elderly care. The PRC needs to identify a model of care \nservices provision that is applicable to the rural population. \n \n8.  Development of a comprehensive elderly care system is important for the PRC to respond \nto its aging population and deliver inclusive development. An ongoing Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) TA project is helping prepare an elderly care policy framework at the central level of the \nPRC,7  and ADB is also providing loan projects to help strengthen the capacity of elderly care \nservice  provision.8 The  knowledge  and  support  TA  will  continue  and  complement  support \nprovided by ADB. It will help prepare plans for elderly care system development by focusing on \ntwo critical issues: (i) elderly care strategy at the local level, and (ii) care for rural elderly people. \n \n6  Rural migrant workers aged 50 years old and above increased from 12.9% of total migrant workers in 2010 to 21.3% \nin 2017. \n7  ADB. 2018.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: accessibility to adequate elderly care services \nimproved (footnote 4). The TA will have the following outcome: strategic plans of elderly care \nsystem developed.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  To help develop a comprehensive elderly care system in the PRC, the TA will include the \nfollowing two components: (i) component 1: prepare local elderly care development strategy, by \ntaking the case of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR), which stresses the importance \nof elderly care development, particularly with the enhancement of private sector involvement \nthough its practical development is still limited; and (ii) component 2: strengthen rural elderly care \ndevelopment, which is one of the most challenging issues on aging in the PRC, although no major \ninterventions have been made yet. The purpose of the TA will be achieved through delivering the \nfollowing three outputs for components 1 and 2.12 \n \n11.  Output 1: Status of elderly care examined. Under component 1, output 1 will examine \nthe case of GZAR with regard to (i) demand and supply of elderly care services, (ii) care needs \nassessment schemes, (iii) service standards and monitoring schemes, (iv) a pilot of long-term \ncare insurance and affordability of care services, (v) intersectoral institutional arrangements,             \n(vi) a human resource development plan,13 and (vii) initiatives to enhance the private sector\u2019s \ninvolvement by focusing on cases at the municipal level. Based on those analyses, this output \nwill deliver a report on the status of elderly care in GZAR. Under component 2, output 1 will \nexamine the (i) care needs of rural elderly people; (ii) available financial sources for elderly people \nto access care services; and (iii) available care for rural elderly people, major care providers, and \nrelated cost implications, through conducting a village-level survey. Current regular practices of \nrural elderly care provision will be also examined. This output will prepare a report on status of \nrural elderly care based on the analyses of the gaps between care needs and available care, \nmajor bottlenecks to meet the care needs of rural elderly people, and recommended practices, if \nany. \n \n \n9  ADB. 2016.

Output 2: Model of elderly care system plan developed. Building on the analyses of \noutput  1,  under  component  1,  this  output  will  deliver  a  report  on  an  elderly  care  system \ndevelopment in GZAR to help the Government of GZAR prepare recommendations on a model \nof its elderly care system by strengthening the involvement of the private sector, including for-\nprofit entities and nonprofit organizations.14 Under component 2, this output will examine potential \nfinancial and human resources; incentives for rural elderly care provision; and potential roles of \nolder people\u2019s associations, civil society organizations, and other volunteer groups in rural elderly \ncare. It will further examine a possible financial framework, including an evaluation of different \noptions on the basis of costs, and the needed institutional arrangements to support a rural elderly \ncare system sustainably. It will also analyze international practices on responsibility alignment \nbetween levels of governments for elderly care service provision. It will then prepare a report on \nmodels of rural elderly care development to help the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs \nprepare a policy recommendation for strengthening rural elderly care. \n \n13.  Output 3: Capacity of central and local governments to manage elderly care service \nprovision  strengthened.  Under  component  1,  this  output  will  provide  opportunities  for \ndepartments, bureaus, and agencies of the Government of GZAR and its municipalities to \nstrengthen their knowledge and capacity on elderly care system development through trainings, \nstudy visits, and workshops. Under component 2, the output will strengthen the capacity and \nknowledge of the central and local governments on rural elderly care development through \norganizing trainings, workshops, and study visits. The reports prepared under outputs 1 and 2 will \nbe discussed and disseminated at those workshops. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $840,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. \n \n15.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office space for meetings, \ncounterpart staff, assistance in arranging meetings with related agencies, and other in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.  The  executing  agency  will  be  the  Foreign  Economic \nCooperation Center, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. The implementing agency for \ncomponent 1 will be the Government of GZAR through the Guangxi project management office, \nwhich  will  coordinate  with  municipal  governments  in  GZAR  to  organize  the  trainings  and \nworkshops. The Foreign Economic Cooperation Center, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs \nwill also take the role of implementing agency for component 2 and will coordinate with central \nministries and provincial governments to organize the trainings and workshops. \n \n17.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \n \n14 The report will review and learn from the findings of ADB. 2014.
