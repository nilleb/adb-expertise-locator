INTRODUCTION\n1. During the 2001 Country Programming Mission, the Government of India requested\ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  preparation  of  the\nNational Highway Corridor \u2013 Public-Private Partnership \u2013 Project (the NHC Project) which is\nincluded in ADB\u2019s 2002-2004 lending program for India. An ADB TA Fact-Finding Mission\nvisited India from 24 to 30 June 2001 and reached an understanding with the Government on\nthe scope and other aspects of the TA for preparation of the NHC Project.1\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Sector  Background.  India  has  an  extensive  and  diversified  transport  system,\ncomprising 3,291,000 kilometers (km) of roads, 62,800 km of railways, and about 14,500 km of\nnavigable  inland  waterways.  The  modal  mix  between  road  and  rail  transport2  has  been\ncontinuously shifting away from railway to road due to the former\u2019s lack of user oriented service\nprovision. Consequently, road transport is now the dominant mode of transportation, accounting\nfor 60 percent of freight movement and 80 percent of passenger traffic. This modal shift is likely\nto continue in the future as transport demands will shift from bulky to smaller lot size cargoes\nwith more frequent delivery requirements. This will call for further improvement and expansion\nof the road network.\n3. India\u2019s road network consists of three categories: (i) national highways (50,000 km), (ii)\nstate  highways/roads  (119,000  km),  and  (iii)  rural  roads  (3,122,000  km).  While  national\nhighways account for only 2 percent of the total road network in terms of length, they carry\nabout 40 percent of the total traffic. National highways are managed by two agencies: the\nNational Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways\n(MORTH). NHAI was established in 1988 and operationalized in 1995 as an operating arm of\nMORTH. NHAI is responsible for one fourth of the national highways, which carry around 25\npercent of the nation\u2019s total traffic, while MORTH is responsible for the remaining three fourths\nof national highways which carry 15 percent of the total traffic.\n4. India\u2019s economy has long suffered a chronic capacity shortage. Thirty-nine percent of\nthe national highways system is still of single-lane standard; the majority (59 percent) is two-\nlane, while four-lane or higher standard highways account for only 2 percent. Faced with this\ncapacity shortage, the Government has decided to launch a radical program of upgrading key\nnational highways consisting of (i) the golden quadrilateral \u2013 6,000 km; (ii) the north-south\ncorridor (N-S Corridor) \u2013 4,000 km; and (iii) east-west corridor (E-W Corridor) \u2013 3,300 km. The\nprogram was announced in 1998 and is to be completed by the end of 2007. The total cost of\nthe program is estimated at around $13 billion.\n5. Programmatic Approach. To finance its road program, the Government has requested\nADB for a series of loans over the next few years. In response, ADB has decided to adopt a\nprogrammatic approach in extending loans to NHAI as the most effective way of maximizing the\ndevelopmental impact of changes in the highway sector.\n6. The  Western  Transport  Corridor  (WTC)  Project3  is  the  first  project  that  has  been\nprocessed under the programmatic approach. The proposed NHC Project is the second project\n                                                          \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in June 2001.\n2  Inland waterways play a very minor role in India\u2019s transport system. According to the Inland Water Transport Policy\n(2000) of the Ministry of Shipping, they carry less than 1 percent of the total inland cargo in terms of ton-kilometers.\n3 Loan 1839-IND: Western Transport Project, for $240 million, approved on 20 September 2001.", "2\nto be prepared and processed under this approach. This requires the NHC Project to be\nprepared in a manner significantly different from traditional investment projects.\n7. Policy and Institutional Reform. The main thrust of the programmatic approach is\npolicy and institutional reforms at NHAI. The principal reform agenda that ADB intends to pursue\nunder the pragrammatic approach includes:\n(i)  transforming NHAI into a financially and managerially autonomous body including\na corporatized form of organization;\n(ii)  enhancing the corporate finance capability of NHAI including that for capital\nmobilization, financial reporting, and treasury function enhancement;\n(iii)  promoting  and  further  elaborating  the  public-private  partnership  concept  in\nhighway development and maintenance;\n(iv)  strengthening  NHAI\u2019s  project  management  capability,  particularly  in  terms  of\nenvironmental assessment, resettlement, procurement, and disbursement; and\n(v)  enhancing  corporate  governance,  particularly  with  regard  to  increased\ntransparency in transactions, public procurement, and contract management.\n8. Substantial parts of this agenda will be addressed in the recently approved WTC Project.\nIts accompanying TA would assist NHAI in developing necessary strategies for enhancing the\ncorporate finance capability of NHAI and in exploring alternative forms of organization. Ongoing\nTAs4 would also contribute to strengthening the project management capability of NHAI. A\nremaining area of work is to set out a medium- to long-term road map that would guide a variety\nof reform actions to be integrated to serve the eventual materialization of policy goals. Milestone\nactions that trigger the processing of the next project under the programmatic approach also\nneed to be identified.\n9. Investment  Strategy  under  the  Public-Private  Partnership. The  private  sector  is\npotentially  a  major  player  in  infrastructure  development.  India  has  been  ardently  pursuing\nprivate  development  in  the  highway  sector  with  strong  policy  support  from  the  Central\nGovernment (e.g., the announcement of \u201cGuideline for Private Sector Participation in the Road\nInfrastructure\u201d  in  1997  and  the  development  of  a  model  concession  agreement  for  build-\noperate-transfer (BOT) schemes for highway development in 2000). However, the results so far\nare mixed. Short-section developments such as bypasses and bridges have been successful in\nintroducing private sector investment (PSI) through BOT schemes. For longer and larger scale\nprojects, NHAI has, however, been experiencing difficulties in attracting an adequate number of\nbidders. This has led NHAI to consider and apply less attractive \u201cannuity-based BOT schemes\u201d5\nby freeing the private sector from assuming a major commercial risk. Special purpose vehicles\ncombined with later stage disinvestments or initial public offerings have now emerged as an\nalternative method of mobilizing private sector funds (where the construction risk is not borne by\nthe private sector, but by NHAI). A new initiative has also been taken by the private sector in the\narea  of  infrastructure  financing.  A  holding  company  specializing  in  toll  road  financing  was\nestablished in 2000, which sponsors and invests in multiple toll road projects at various stages\n                                                          \n4 TA 3365-IND: Capacity Building for Social Development, for $800,000, approved on 23 December 1999; and TA\n3361-IND: Capacity Building for Contract Supervision and Management, for $600,000, approved on 22 December\n1999.\n5  A predetermined amount of the money will be paid annually to the concessionaire to cover the cost of development,\noperations, and maintenance.", "3\nof development with the intention of reducing the overall risk of toll road projects. With these\ndevelopments, NHAI is now entering into the second stage of PSI development wherein a more\npractical approach will be pursued (i.e., fewer risks being borne by the private sector, but higher\nprobability of success being pursued).\n10. During the TA Fact-Finding Mission, NHAI and ADB agreed to take up 1,500 km of\nnorth-south and east-west corridors (hereinafter called the \u201cprogram corridor\u201d) and develop an\ninvestment strategy for the entire stretch of the program corridor in consideration of the recent\nexperiences of NHAI. This program corridor, which extends from Porbandar (Gujarat) to Agra\n(Uttar  Pradesh)  via  Jhansi  (Madhya  Pradesh),  would  present  an  appropriate  sequence  of\ninvestments that may be supported through ADB loans to be developed under the programmatic\napproach.\n11. To identify possible PSI opportunities along the program corridor, a screening survey\nwould be carried out. Specific modalities of investment are to be developed for each section of\nthe program corridor. For those sections identified suitable for the PSI, specific investment\npackages would be developed, together with tender documents and bid evaluation criteria. The\nTA will be provided for these tasks.\n12. Project Concept. During the TA Fact-Finding Mission, ADB was requested to extend\nsupport to NHAI in its specific project preparation activities for the NHC Project. NHAI identified\npriority sections of approximately 300 km to be included in the proposed NHC Project. These\nsections, located primarily in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, will be upgraded from the current\ntwo-lane to four-lane highways under the public-private partnership concept. It was agreed to\nexplore the possibility of ADB\u2019s financing a portion of NHAI\u2019s grant to be extended to the\nconcessionaires. While the feasibility study, preliminary design, and detailed engineering design\nfor these sections will be conducted by NHAI\u2019s consultants, ADB\u2019s TA will focus on assistance\nto  ensure  that  NHAI\u2019s  project  preparation  efforts  will  meet  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for  project\nprocessing, particularly in the areas of social assessment, environment, resettlement, poverty\nimpact assessment, economic and financial analysis, design standards, and procurement.\nIII. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n13. The objectives of the TA are to (i) set out an overall road map to be followed under the\nprogrammatic approach for India\u2019s road subsector, and (ii) provide expert advice to NHAI to\nfacilitate the preparation of the proposed NHC Project.\nB. Scope\n14. Consulting services will be provided to carry out the following three groups of activities:\nComponent A: Development of a road map for policy and institutional reforms to be\nfollowed under the programmatic approach, together with identification of milestone\nactions that would trigger ADB\u2019s processing of the next project\nComponent B: Implementation of a screening test for identifying PSI opportunities for\nthe program corridor of 1,500 km, and recommendation of modalities of investments for\neach  section  of  the  corridor;  and,  for  those  sections  identified  for  possible  PSI\ndevelopment, design of specific investment packages and, if it is decided to pursue PSI,\ntender documents", "4\nComponent C: Project preparation support for the selected highway sections to be\nrehabilitated and upgraded under the proposed NHC Project covering (i) environmental\nand social assessment, (ii) engineering and procurement support, and (iii) economic and\nfinancial analysis and governance assessment\nC. Cost Estimates\n15. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $900,000 equivalent, consisting of $608,585 in\nforeign exchange and $291,415 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will finance $700,000\nequivalent from the ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund. NHAI will finance $200,000\nequivalent by providing office accommodation, support facilities, counterpart staff, vehicles, and\nother logistical support. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix\n1.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n16. The executing agency will be NHAI, which will establish the project preparation unit\nheaded by a chief general manager (corridors).\n17. The TA consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic\nconsultants. For Components A and C(iii), individual consultants will be engaged; 2.8 person-\nmonths of international and 1.4 person-months of domestic consultant inputs are estimated to\nbe required. For Components B, C(i), and C(ii), a consulting firm will be engaged in accordance\nwith  ADB\u2019s  simplified  technical  proposal  selection  procedures;  12.3  person-months  of\ninternational and 7.7 person-months of domestic consultants are estimated to be required.\n18. The  individual  consultants  in  charge  of  Components  A  and  C(iii)  are  expected  to\ncommence their services in January 2002 and to complete such services by June 2002. The\nconsulting firm in charge of Components B, C(i), and C(ii) is expected to commence its services\nin December 2001, and to complete such services by August 2002. The TA will commence on 1\nDecember 2001 and be closed on 31 October 2002. Terms of reference for the consultants are\noutlined in Appendix 2.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n19. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance to the Government of India in an amount not exceeding the\nequivalent of $700,000 for the purpose of preparing the National Highway Corridor \u2013 Public-\nPrivate Partnership \u2013 Project, and hereby reports such action to the Board. This technical\nassistance  will  be  financed  initially  as  a  grant,  but  will  be  subject  to  the  reimbursement\narrangements set forth in the Board papers on Technical Assistance Operations (Doc. R51-77,\ndated 20 May 1977) and Streamlining of Technical Assistance Operations (Doc. R44-88, dated\n21 March 1988), including the provision that, in the event of the technical assistance resulting in\na loan from ADB, ADB may charge against such loan, and recover from it, the portion of the\ninitial grant that exceeds $250,000 equivalent.", " 5\nAppendix 1\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

Components A and C(iii)\n1. A team of two individual consultants, one international and one domestic will be engaged\nto carry out two tasks: Component A (development of road maps for institutional reforms of\nNational Highways Authority of India [NHAI]) and Component C(iii) (economic and financial\nanalyses).  The  major  qualifications  of  the  international  consultant  will  include  extensive\nknowledge of transport sector policies and institutional reforms, particularly enterprise reform,\nand expertise on and experience with economic and financial analyses. A major qualification of\nthe domestic consultant will be extensive knowledge of India\u2019s transport sector. The task will\nrequire 2.8 person-months of input by the international consultant, and 2.8 person-months from\nthe domestic consultant.  Specifically, the consultants will\n(i)  Update  the  sector  background  information  incorporated  in  the  Report  and\nRecommendation of the President on the Western Transport Corridor Project\n(WTC-RRP)  (Technical  Report  A-1  on  sector  background  and  government\npolicies).\n(ii)  Review the Government\u2019s policies on (a) enterprise reform, and (b) private sector\nparticipation in infrastructure (Technical Report A-2 on enterprise reform and the\nprivate sector development in infrastructure).\n(iii)  Refine, update, and amplify the current policy reform matrix (Appendix 4) of the\nWTC-RRP,  together  with  the  current  status  of  the  implementation  of  these\nreforms (Technical Report A-3 on policy reform matrix).\n(iv)  Develop a road map showing how the policy reform agenda is to be developed,\ntogether with the identification of milestone actions that will trigger processing of\nthe next Asian Development Bank (ADB) projects (Technical Report A-4 on a\npolicy road map and milestone actions).\n(v)  Organize a workshop to facilitate policy dialogue among ADB, the World Bank,\nand relevant ministries/authorities of the Government of India.\n(vi)  Review and comment on the economic analysis done by NHAI\u2019s consultants to\nensure that all key elements are adequately covered in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects;  provide  the  necessary\nassistance to the NHAI consultants to complete their economic analysis.\n(vii)  Prepare a short technical report on the economic analysis (Technical Report C-3-\n1 on economic analysis).\n(viii)  Review and comment on the financial analysis done by the NHAI\u2019s consultants to\nensure that all key elements are adequately covered in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nforthcoming Guidelines on the Financial Management of Investment Projects;\nprovide  the  necessary  assistance  to  the  NHAI  consultants  to  ensure  these\nrecommendations are incorporated in their reports.\n(Reference in text: page 4, para. 18)", "Appendix 2, page 2\n7\n(ix)  Prepare a short technical report on financial analysis of the National Highway\nCorridor Project (Technical Report C-3-2 on financial analysis).\n(x)  Conduct a quick financial analysis of NHAI by projecting its cash flow for the next\nfive years, together with income statements and balance sheets for the same\nperiod of time (Technical Report C-3-3 on financial projection).\nB.  Components B, C(i), and C(ii)\n2. The consultants should form three teams for (i) the public-private partnership investment\nstrategy,  (ii)  environmental  and  social  assessment,  and  (iii)  engineering  and  procurement\nsupport.  Among the various specialists, one should be assigned as the task manager.\n1. Development of the Public-Private Partnership Investment Strategy\n3. A team of consultants consisting of international and domestic experts will be engaged\nfor carrying out the tasks listed below. The team will consist of (i) an international transport\neconomist who is familiar with toll road operations, (ii) an international financial analyst who is\nfamiliar with project finance and credit enhancement mechanisms, (iii) a domestic financial\nanalyst who is well versed in computer modeling, and (iv) a domestic traffic engineer who will\nmanage the traffic count survey. The team will be supported by local researchers to conduct\ntraffic counts on key spots along the program corridor. The task will require 6.0 person-months\nof input by the two international consultants and 7.0 person-months from the two domestic\nconsultants. The consultants will do the following:\n(i)  Review  (a)  India\u2019s  past  experiences  with  infrastructure  development  through\nprivate sector investment (PSI) schemes, and (b) those of NHAI with highway\ndevelopment/rehabilitation, and, based on these reviews, develop possible types\nof PSI to be applied to the program corridor (Technical Report B-1 on PSI\nschemes and possible types of PSIs for the program corridor). Possible types of\nPSIs  include,  among  others,  build-operate-transfer  or  rehabilitate-operate-\ntransfer  schemes,  annuity-based  toll  concessioning  schemes,  and  special\npurpose vehicle schemes combined with later state disinvestment or initial public\noffering.  The  review  should  include  the  possible  use  of  credit  enhancement\nmechanisms such as the partial credit/risk guarantee. The consultant should also\nlook into the appropriate size of PSI projects that may enable NHAI to reduce\ntransaction costs or avoid excessively long negotiations.\n(ii)  Develop  a  financial  model  that  would  enable  NHAI  to  compare  a  variety  of\ninvestment packages, and determine the extent of required financial support.\nThis  will  require  determination  of  the  criteria  or  parameters  (such  as  equity\nfinancial rate of return) that would be used to determine the attractiveness of\nspecific  investment  projects  from  the  viewpoint  of  PSI  investors.  The  model\nshould use Excel or another similar spreadsheet program so that NHAI can use it\nby itself (Technical Report B-2 briefly describing main features of the model).\n(iii)  Screen  PSI  opportunities  for  the  program  corridor,  and  develop\nrecommendations  on  the  modalities  of  investment  for  each  of  its  sections\n(Technical Report B-3 on investment strategy). This will require supplemental\ntraffic surveys at key points of the project corridor (Technical Report B-4 on the", "Appendix 2, page 3\n8\nfindings of traffic survey). While preliminary traffic data are available from NHAI\u2019s\nprioritization studies conducted in 2000/2001 for the entire east-west and north-\nsouth corridors, those traffic data may not be sufficient. It will be necessary to\nsupplement these data by additional traffic surveys to be conducted in key spots\nof the program corridor.\n(iv)  For those sections identified as suited for PSI, design more specific investment\npackages including grant and credit enhancement mechanisms to be considered\nby  NHAI  (Technical  Report  B-5  on  specific  investment  packages  and  credit\nenhancement mechanism).\n(v)  For those sections decided upon to be developed through PSI, develop tender\ndocuments including concession agreements and selection criteria for proposals\n(Technical Report B-6).\n2. Environmental and Social Assessment\n4. A team of experts consisting of international and domestic consultants will be engaged\nfor carrying out the tasks listed below. The team will consist of (i) an international environment\nspecialist, (ii) an international resettlement specialist, (iii) an international economist who is\nfamiliar with distribution analysis with particular focus on poverty impact analysis, and (iv) three\ndomestic consultants covering the same three areas. The task will require 4.2 person-months of\ninput  by  the  three  international  consultants  and  2.1  person-months  by  the  three  domestic\nconsultants. The consultants will\n(i)  Undertake a social assessment of the proposed Project to determine the range of\nsocial  impacts,  addressing  key  social  issues  such  as  land  acquisition  and\nresettlement; poverty; indigenous people; communicable diseases, particularly\nHIV/AIDS; gender; and labor, including child labor (Technical Report C-1-1).\n(ii)  Review the results of feasibility studies and preliminary designs (to be prepared\nby NHAI consultants) with regard to environmental assessment to ensure that all\nrelevant environmental issues are adequately covered in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nEnvironmental Assessment Requirements of ADB, 1998,  and  Environmental\nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects, 1993, as amended from time to\ntime.\n(iii)  Prepare summary reports for an initial environmental examination (IEE) or, if\nrequired, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) (Technical Report C-1-2 on\nsummary IEE/EIA).\n(iv)  Review the results of feasibility studies and preliminary designs with regard to\nland acquisition and resettlement to examine that all relevant resettlement issues\nare adequately covered in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement, A\nGuide to a Good Practice, 1998, as amended from time to time.\n(v)  Prepare a resettlement plan (Technical Report C-1-3) and summary resettlement\nplan report according to the above Handbook on Resettlement (Technical Report\nC-1-4).", "Appendix 2, page 4\n9\n(vi)  Assist NHAI with the formalization of a resettlement policy, operationalization of a\nsocial development unit, and the development of training programs.\n(vii)  Assess potential poverty reduction in the project areas, which should include (a)\npoverty profile, (b) an analysis of transport and poverty, (c) impacts of toll roads\non the poor community, (d) quantitative impact of the Project on the poor, (e)\nqualitative impact on the Project to the poor, and (f) conclusion (Technical Report\nC-1-5).\n5. The consultants will liaise closely with the project preparation team of NHAI, particularly\nduring the design stage, so that environment and social concerns are accommodated by design\nmodifications.\n3. Engineering and Procurement Support\n6. A team of international consultants consisting of a highway engineer and a procurement\nspecialist will be engaged to carry out the tasks listed below, which will require 2.1 person-\nmonths of input.\n(i)  Review the results of feasibility studies and preliminary designs to be prepared\nby NHAI consultants with regard to engineering aspects. Ensure that alignment,\ncost estimates, design standards, pavement structure, drawings for bridges and\ninterchange structures, and toll booths are of standards and quality appropriate\nto national highways and to the anticipated level of traffic.
