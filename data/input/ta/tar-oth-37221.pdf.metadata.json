The regional technical assistance (TA)1 will support emerging initiatives to strengthen air \nquality management (AQM) at the city and national level within the Asian region.2 The TA will \nmake a significant contribution, through improved awareness of decision makers, the integration \nof air pollution in environmental and sector policy making, and the formulation of specific \nintegrated  AQM  action  plans  toward  better  AQM.  Consultations  were  conducted  with  the \ntransport, urban, health, energy, and environment networks in the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB).  The logical framework for the TA is in Appendix 1.  \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  More evidence is becoming available on the harmful impact of air pollution on public \nhealth in Asia and the associated economic and social costs. According to the World Health \nOrganization (WHO), about 500,000 premature deaths occur yearly due to ambient air pollution \nin Asia. The associated economic costs are significant, and typically are about $300 million\u2013400 \nmillion for the megacities in Asia.3 Poor people are especially affected by air pollution. They are \noften most directly exposed to air pollution and they have fewer chances to seek medical \nassistance if affected. \n \n3.  Recent studies, such as Asian Brown Cloud: Climate and other Environmental Impacts \ncarried out by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), have provided evidence that air \npollution is more a regional phenomena than assumed until now. The Asian Brown Cloud \nproject, which conducted the study, aims to (i) develop the science and capacity to study the \nissues of aerosols in the region; (ii) assess the impacts of atmospheric brown clouds on health, \necosystems and agriculture, climate change, and water budgets under one common framework; \nand (iii) raise the awareness on the issue and promote action for mitigation. Studies such as the \nAsian Brown Cloud have increased the attention on the regional dimension of air pollution and \nhave increased scientific understanding of the harmful effects of air pollution (greenhouse \ngases, gaseous pollutants, and ozone) on ecosystems and agriculture in Asia. These harmful \nimpacts are in addition to the local negative effects on public health, which have previously been \nestablished. Important information has also been generated through bilateral programs on AQM \nin Asia.4  \n \n4.  A number of common weaknesses make it difficult for Asian countries to achieve healthful \nair quality standards: (i) insufficient monitoring of air quality and analysis to determine the \n                                                 \n1  The technical assistance (TA) first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 10 May 2003. \n2 This TA builds on the work carried out under ADB. 2002.  Technical Assistance for Action Plans for Reducing \nVehicle Emissions. Manila (TA:5937-REG), and ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance for Clean Air Initiative for Asian \nCities. Manila (TA:6016-REG). TA:5937-REG resulted in the formulation of policy guidelines to reduce vehicle \nemissions in Asia, and a number of studies and action plans, which have resulted in follow-up action by ADB in \nIndonesia, and by the United States Asia Environmental Partnership in Viet Nam. In other cases, such as the study \non Compressed Natural Gas versus Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel in Mumbai, a substantive impact was made on shaping \nthe policy debate on this topic in Asia. TA:6016-REG has been successful in establishing the Clean Air Initiative for \nAsian Cities (CAI-Asia), with currently over 100 organizational and 600 individual members and is now cofunded by \n10 private sector firms. A web site has been set up and a successful Internet-based discussion group has been \nestablished. A capacity building arm of CAI-Asia established the Clean Air Training Network for Asia (CATNet-\nAsia). Three pilot projects have been initiated: (i) Public Health Impact of Air Pollution in Asia, (ii) Reducing Diesel \nEmissions in Bangkok, (iii) Cost of Refinery Upgrading for Diesel Refineries in Asia.  \n3  ADB. 2003. Policy Guidelines for Reducing Vehicle Emissions in Asia. Manila.  \n4 The most comprehensive programs are those of the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, \nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency, United States-Asia Environmental Partnership, and German \nAgency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ).   ", "2 \nsources of pollution; (ii) emission standards for different types of sources are  (still) too lenient \nand this makes compliance with WHO ambient air quality standards unlikely; (iii) the institutional \nresponsibility for AQM is fragmented and coordination mechanisms are not well developed; (iv)  \nlack of capacity and political commitment have generally resulted in weak enforcement of \nemission  standards;  (v)  air  pollution  is  not  often  considered  an  important  factor  in  the \nformulation  of  environmental  and  important  sector  specific  policies;  (vi)  the  polluter  pays \nprinciple is generally supported but little concrete progress has been made in introducing \neconomic instruments to stimulate the abatement or prevention of air pollution; (vii)  good \npractices and guidelines on AQM are not widely known in Asia; and (viii) relatively little attention \nis given to address air quality issues at a regional level in Asia.   \n \n5.  A  growing  number  of  local  and  national  governments  have  started  formulating  and \nimplementing AQM strategies,5,6 but there is a continued need at the local, national, and \nregional7 levels to stimulate more broad-based involvement in AQM and to improve the quantity, \nrelevance, and quality of AQM activities. Previous activities have had a strong focus on raising \nawareness about the harmful impact of air pollution. This needs to be followed by a stronger \nemphasis on actual policy formulation and the formulation and implementation of concrete AQM \ninterventions. A key consideration is strengthening the linkage between government, private \nsector, and civil society in the formulation and implementation of AQM plans.  \n \n6.  Strong  coordinative  approaches  are  required  to  enable  effective  information \ndissemination on air quality issues, collective learning, and the formulation of comprehensive \nAQM  strategies.  Past  approaches  toward  AQM  have  often  been  too  ambitious,  and \ngovernments  adopted  overly  complicated  legislation  and  policies,  that  often  were  not \nimplemented due to a combination of the lack of government capacity to enforce regulations \nand limited buy-in from key stakeholders. The Clean Air Initiative for Asian Cities (CAI-Asia) has \nproven to be an effective regional forum for promoting AQM in Asia, as is demonstrated by the \ninterest shown by cities, national government agencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \nand private sector organizations to join CAI-Asia as a member or support its activities.8 \n \n                                                 \n5 ADB is providing assistance to a number of countries and cities, namely:  ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation \nof the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans to the Republic of the Philippines for Metro Manila Air \nQuality Improvement Sector Development Program. Manila; ADB. 2002.  Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for Dhaka Clean \nFuel Project. Manila; and ADB. 2002.Technical Assistance to Indonesia for Preparing the Clean Vehicle Fuel for \nBlue Skies Project. Manila. Further AQM activities are included in the country programs for Afghanistan, People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. \n6  Support is provided under TA:6016-REG (footnote 2) to the second phase of a benchmarking study of air quality \nmanagement (AQM) in Asia, which covers 27 cities. \n7  ADB, in cooperation with the Air Pollution in Megacities of Asia Project, is developing under TA:6016-REG \n(footnote 2) a strategic framework for AQM, which is intended to guide cities in Asia in their efforts to intensify \nAQM. \n8  CAI-Asia has about 95 organizational members, which include 23 megacities and other large cities in Asia, and \nrelevant national government departments in most of the Asian countries. Membership criteria for cities and \nnational government agencies specify the willingness to set up a multistakeholder forum to coordinate the \nformulation and implementation of an AQM strategy. Cities also have to express a commitment to invest their own \nresources in AQM. CAI-Asia was established in 2001 with active support from ADB, and ADB is currently the main \nhost of the CAI-Asia Secretariat. So far, TA:6016-REG (footnote 2), which provides support to the establishment of \nCAI-Asia is ADB's only TA which is cofinanced by the private sector. The TA will contribute to the Mayors Asia \nPacific Environmental Summit (MAPES) process, which is also supported by ADB. In MAPES, mayors of Asian \ncities are invited to make commitments on what their cities will do to make improvements in environmental \nmanagement, including air quality. The TA will assist a number of cities, which have made commitments in the \nmost recent MAPES in Hawaii in September 2003. \n ", "    3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The TA will make a significant contribution, through (i) improved awareness of decision \nmakers,  and  (ii)  the  integration  of  air  pollution  in  environmental  policy  making  and \nimplementation as well as in planning and implementing specific sector policies that regulate \nsectors that influence air  pollution levels. The sectors include transport, energy, health, and \nurban development sectors. Improvements in policies and associated legislation combined with \nspecific activities in the countries to monitor ambient air quality and reduce individual sources of \npollution will help achieve medium- and long-term improvements in ambient air quality.  \n \n8.    The TA will have the following components and outputs: \n \n(i)  improved  knowledge  of  the  economic  and  social  implications  of  local  and \nregional  air  pollution  by  decision  makers  in  Asia  from  local  and  national \ngovernments, private sector, and NGOs; \n \n(ii)  formulation of appropriate response strategies (legislation, policies, and project \nactivities)  at  local,  national,  and  regional  levels,  which  will  contribute  to \nprevention and abatement of local and regional air pollution; and \n \n(iii)  strengthening of regional dialogue and exchange of information on AQM and \nidentification of regional approaches to improve AQM.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.    The  TA  will  undertake  the  following  key  activities  to  implement  its  three  main \ncomponents: \n \n(i)  Output 1. Improved knowledge base and better understanding of economic and \nsocial implications of local and regional air pollution by decision makers in Asia: \n \n(a)  documenting of past and ongoing air pollution health impact studies in \nAsia, \n \n(b)  dissemination  of  air  quality-related  information  through \nhttp://worldbank.org/cleanair/caiasia and http://adb.org/vehicle-emissions, \n \n(c)  facilitation of  discussions on AQM in Asia on the CAI-Asia electronic \nmailing list, \n \n(d)  mainstreaming of air quality concerns in ADB\u2019s operations and building of \ncapacity to respond to requests for assistance for AQM programs, and  \n \n(e)  dissemination of AQM information in relevant workshops; \n ", "4 \n(ii)  Output 2. Formulation of national and local AQM strategies and the identification \nof AQM assistance in selected locations:9 \n(a)  support for the establishment or strengthening of local and national level \nmultistakeholder groups, \n \n(b)  capacity building of local and national multistakeholder forums in AQM, \n \n(c)  support for the (re)formulation of national and/or local AQM legislation \nand/or strategies in selected locations, \n \n(d)  promotion of the integration of national and local air quality issues in ADB \noperational documents for participating countries, \n \n(e)  identification of assistance in the six targeted locations; \n \n(iii)  Output 3.  Regional dialogue on AQM: \n \n(a)  development of a regional agenda on AQM for Asia; \n \n(b)  development of coordination and cooperation with regional bodies such \nas the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),  South Asian \nAssociation  for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC),  and  international \norganizations such as UNEP to promote regional approaches to AQM; \nand \n \n(c)  identification  of  regional  TA  to  stimulate  monitoring  and  analysis  of \nregional, trans-boundary air pollution, and support other measures to aid \nthe implementation of the common regional agenda on AQM. \n \n10.  The TA will also, at a more general level, help identify overall investment needs for AQM \nat the regional level. This will take into account the expected source of such investments (i.e., \nprivate sector or national government) and the mechanisms through which the polluters-pay \nprinciple can be used to transfer costs to the polluters. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $300,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The cost estimates \nprovide for consulting services, international travel, administrative costs, workshop expenses, \nand studies. It is anticipated that the private sector will contribute to the implementation of the \nTA. Private sector cofinancing to TA: 6016-REG (footnote 8) amounts to about $240,000 as of \n18 September 2003. If private sector cofinancing is received, the scope of the TA will be \nextended. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n9  Possible areas for assistance include (i) ambient air quality monitoring, (ii) cleaner production, (iii) cleaner fuels and \nvehicles, and (iv) sustainable transport. The tentative list of cities to be covered by the TA are Baguio, Philippines; \nColombo, Sri Lanka; Haiphong, Viet Nam, Lahore, Pakistan; and Surabaya, Indonesia, and one or more cities in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China.   \n \n ", "    5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.   The TA will be implemented over an 18-month period to commence in  November 2003 \nand will be completed by April 2005. The TA will be executed by ADB and will be supervised by \nthe Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD). ADB will coordinate closely \nwith the CAI-Asia in implementing the TA. A team, headed by the Finance and Infrastructure \nDivision  of  RSDD,  will  actively  coordinate  with  the  transport,  energy,  health,  urban \nmanagement, and environment committees and networks in ADB; the regional departments; \nand  resident  missions  in  developing  member  countries  where  the  TA  will  promote  the \ndevelopment of local networks and the formulation of AQM strategies. In the selected countries, \nthe TA will work actively with existing multistakeholder networks established under the CAI-Asia \nor by other groups. \n \n13.  The TA will require about 5 person-months of international consulting services to assist \nwith the implementation, especially to support the establishment of local networks and the \nformulation of AQM actions plans. A total of 28 person-months of domestic consulting services \nwill  be  required  to  help  establish  local  networks  and  support  the  local  networks  in  the \nformulation of local action plans and identification of assistance for AQM. The consultants will \nbe engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants \nwill be engaged as individual or through a consulting firm, whichever is more appropriate under \nthe circumstances of countries taking part in the TA. The outline terms of reference are given in \nAppendix 3. \n \n14.  The results of the TA will be disseminated through the ADB and the CAI-Asia web sites, \nas well as other communication channels of CAI-Asia, including but not limited to the CAI-Asia \nelectronic mailing list and newsletter.10 Local workshops are planned for countries and/or cities \nwhere the TA will support the establishment of a local network for AQM. Furthermore, the TA \nwill support the organization of one regional workshop to disseminate the results of the TA and \nthe participation of key project stakeholders in other relevant regional workshops.    \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis for \nBetter Air Quality Management in Asia, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n10 ADB currently has a dedicated section on AQM on its web site (http://adb.org/vehicle-emissions). Activities are \nongoing to merge the content of this site with the current CAI-Asia web site (http://worldbank.org/cleanair/caiasia), \nwhich in the future will be hosted on an external server with the URL: http://cleanairnet.org/caiasia.
