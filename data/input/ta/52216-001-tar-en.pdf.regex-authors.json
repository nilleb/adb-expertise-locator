INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  cluster  will  support  the \npreparation of the Asian Development Outlook (ADO) through research and development in the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) headquarters. It will analyze the macroeconomic prospects of \nADB\u2019s developing member economies (DMEs) and provide insights into the economic issues \nand challenges facing Asia and the Pacific. The ADO provides vital intelligence to policy makers \nin DMEs, ADB Management and shareholders, and researchers globally; and underpins ADB \noperational decisions. The ADO showcases ADB\u2019s knowledge and expertise about Asia and the \nPacific. \n \n2.  The TA was submitted in October 2017 to the Strategy, Policy and Review Department \nas  part  of  the  priority  TA  program  of  the  Economic  Research  and  Regional  Cooperation \nDepartment (ERCD) and was endorsed as a corporate priority TA in December 2017.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Developing Asia have made considerable progress in economic growth and poverty \nreduction since the 1960s.2 It has been the world\u2019s fastest-growing region in recent years, \naccounting for about 60% of global growth from 2013 to 2017. Developing Asia has transitioned \nfrom a region of low-income economies to one dominated by middle-income economies, with \nabout 80% of DMEs enjoying middle-class status in 2015.3 However, DMEs remain vulnerable \nto a multitude of challenges caused by entrenched poverty and vulnerability, global economic \nuncertainty,  inequality,  climate  change  and  environmental  degradation,  food  security, \nurbanization,  and  aging.  These  challenges  present  both  difficulties  and  opportunities.  The \nchanging global and regional economic landscape has exposed developing economies in Asia \nto frequent macroeconomic shocks. In some economies, limited data and other constraints \nimpede reliable short-term macroeconomic forecasting, and make it difficult to choose the most \neffective policy tools to promote macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth. \n \n4.  Asia and the Pacific has experienced a significant increase in the number of disasters \ntriggered by natural hazards\u2014such as floods, typhoons and cyclones, drought, earthquakes, \nvolcanic eruptions, and tsunamis\u2014from some 400 in the 1970s to more than 1,100 in the \n2010s. In 2017, disaster-related damage totaled about $35 million.4 This threatens the region\u2019s \nlong-term sustainability and development, and concerted effort is needed to formulate policies \nand institute systems and safety nets to respond to increasing threats from natural hazards. \n \n5.  Asia is poised to experience a dramatic increase in urbanization. Cities are widely \nviewed to be driving growth and creating economic opportunities, and in this context increasing \nurbanization in Asia portends well for the future. But to realize the opportunities associated with \nurbanization, Asia\u2019s cities must overcome various challenges, including those resulting from \ninadequate investments in infrastructure and amenities (e.g., affordable housing, schools, and \nhospitals); weak urban planning and suboptimal land use policies; ineffective urban governance \nstructures; and a lack of strong institutions. \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 August 2018. \n2  Developing Asia refers to the 45 developing member economies of ADB. \n3  ADB. 2017. Asian Development Outlook 2017: Transcending the Middle-Income Challenge. Manila. \n4  Center  for  Research  on  the  Epidemiology  of  Disasters.  EM-DAT  database.  https://www.emdat.be/database \n(accessed 3 August 2018). \n ", "2 \n6.  The adoption of technological advances\u2014such as high-yield crops in agriculture and \nmodern machine tools in manufacturing\u2014have lifted million of people out of poverty in Asia. The \nregion\u2019s economies, especially those that have reached middle-income status, need to foster \ntheir ability to innovate. Technology offers new ways to solve pressing issues in areas as \ndiverse as disaster preparedness, safety, transportation, clean water, and affordable health \ncare, and it is essential that countries in the region develop their capability to innovate, and thus \nboost their efficiency and increase employment, both directly and indirectly. \n \n7.  Asia\u2019s transformation into a middle-income region has led the region\u2019s inhabitants to \naspire for a better quality of life, and to place a higher priority on well-being and happiness. For \nexample, the People\u2019s Republic of China has included its people\u2019s well-being as a strategic \nnational goal, while Bhutan has pioneered the measurement and monitoring of gross national \nhappiness  as  a  broader  policy  target  than  gross  domestic  product.  Furthermore,  Asia\u2019s \npopulation is aging, which when combined with increasing incomes will result in demand for a \nbroader range of personal services. The change in demand for services such as health care and \ntourism  has  boosted  the  \u201cwellness  industry\u201d  globally,  and  will  provide  opportunities  and \nchallenges for inclusive sustainable development in the region. \n \n8.  Many DMEs have limited capacity to respond to these emerging challenges, in part \nbecause  policy  makers  lack  precedents  to  help  them  formulate  sound  responses.  This \nemphasizes  the  need  for  up-to-date  research  and  comprehensive  analyses  of  evolving \nmacroeconomic developments and issues affecting the region, and in particular examples of \nbest practices from other countries. As stated in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, ADB\u2019s relevance will \nincreasingly depend on its role as a knowledge institution, and particularly its proactive role in \nresearch. ADB\u2019s knowledge and evidence-based research is pivotal in raising understanding \nand awareness of critical areas for action, supporting good policies and reform in DMEs, and \nadding to global development discussions by offering perspectives from the region.5 \n \n9.  The TA cluster implemented through three subprojects will support activities to produce \none  of  ADB\u2019s  flagship  publications.  The  ADO\u2019s  comprehensive  analysis  of  evolving \nmacroeconomic  advances  and  emerging  development  challenges  in the  region  helps  ADB \nstrengthen its role as a knowledge institution, and supports the knowledge and operational work \nof ADB\u2019s regional departments. Country chapters monitor the latest economic developments \nand  provide  a  near-term  outlook,  which  are  essential  in  developing  appropriate  policy \nrecommendations to ensure macroeconomic stability. The chapters\u2019 policy challenge sections \nanalyze key obstacles to inclusive economic growth, such as (i) factors preventing productive \nemployment  generation,  (ii)  human  development  constraints,  (iii)  gender  and  other \nsocioeconomic  and  demographic  barriers,  (iv)  spatial  and  geographical  limitations,  (v) \ninstitutional and policy weaknesses, and (vi) factors preventing expansion of social protection \nprograms. The thematic chapters examine important development challenges for a transforming \nAsia and the Pacific. Recent themes include assessing the impact of technology on jobs, \nleveraging public\u2013private partnerships, transcending the middle-income challenge, and shifting \neconomies to a low-carbon growth path. The ADO can help provide research and data support \nfor participation by ADB Management in regional and global policy forums and contribute to \ninformed debate in topical areas, such as climate change and disaster risk, rapid urbanization, \ninnovation and technology, and the future of the service industry. The report\u2019s analysis of the \nregion provides insights that help guide appropriate policy responses to the economic issues \nfacing the region. \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n ", "3 \n \nIII.  JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n \n10.  The Macroeconomics Research Division (ERMR) of ADB\u2019s Economic Research and \nRegional Cooperation Department (ERCD) will continue to formulate a 2-year rolling research \nplan centered on enhancing the quality of ADB\u2019s flagship publications. This is an initiative that \nERCD (previously the Economic and Research Department) began in 2011 in response to \ngrowing demand for knowledge solutions from ADB DMEs, knowledge-related support from \nADB, and an Asian voice in international forums.6 The extension of the research production \nprocess has proven beneficial for the ADO, especially in preparing the thematic chapters, as it \nallowed ERMR more time for in-depth analysis and rigorous peer review. The ADO will address \nseveral important development challenges facing the transforming Asia and Pacific region, \nmaking the TA cluster approach an appropriate modality to ensure ongoing support for the 2-\nyear rolling research work through timely engagement of experts and other activities. \n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \n \nA.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n11.  The TA cluster is aligned with the following impacts: (i) environment within which policy \nformulation occurs influenced by the ADO and (ii) debates and policy research on important \ndevelopment challenges facing Asia and the Pacific spurred by the ADO. The TA cluster will \nhave the following outcome: reference to the ADO by the media, economic researchers, and \nDME officials maintained or increased.7 \n \n12.  Output  1:  Asian  Development  Outlook,  its  update,  and  its  supplements \ndisseminated. The TA cluster will support the production of the ADO, one of ADB\u2019s flagship \npublications. It will support (i) preparing background analytical papers following the 2-year rolling \nresearch plan, (ii) further developing and refining analytical methods, (iii) drafting ADO content \nfor 2019\u20132021, (iv) editing economic content and manuscripts, (v) preparing and laying out \nmaterials  for  publication,  and  (vi)  disseminating  key  results  and  policy  messages.  The \npublications  will  be  widely  disseminated  in  collaboration  with  ADB\u2019s  Department  of \nCommunications and participating resident missions. The international launch will be followed \nby presentations cohosted by ADB development partners within and outside Asia and the \nPacific. Outreach will include analytical discussions of the issues in partnership with academic \ninstitutions and think tanks. The ADOs will be disseminated as electronic files on the ADB \nwebsite, but because there is still demand for printed copies from Management and outside \nresearchers, ERCD will print limited copies (about 500 each year) in compliance with the \nAdministrative  Order  on  Energy,  Environment,  Health,  and  Safety  Management  System.8 \nPrinting of the ADO switched to print-on-demand in 2017. \n \n13.  Output 2: Background papers published. To provide a solid empirical and analytical \nfoundation for ADO content, the TA cluster will commission background research papers to \nsupplement ERMR research on selected thematic topics\u2014such as climate change and disaster \nrisk, environmental sustainability, rapid urbanization, innovation and technology, and the future \nof  the  service  industry\u2014by  analyzing  issues  and  policy  implications  for  developing  Asia. \n                                                \n6  ADB (ERCD). 2011.

AO 4.13. \nManila. \n ", "4 \nConferences focusing on the thematic chapters will be organized to strengthen ADO content, \nand distinguished economists will be invited to discuss initial drafts of the background papers to \nimprove the analytical rigor and policy relevance of the thematic chapters. These papers will be \nconsolidated in edited research volumes to provide researchers with more extensive analyses \nrelated to the thematic topics. The research volumes may be copublished with a reputable \npublishing house, which could entail a buy-back arrangement. Background papers will also be \npublished as working papers on the ADB website. \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $3,000,000 ($1,000,000 for each of the three TA \nsubprojects), which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF 6 for subproject 1; subsequent subprojects will be financed by the succeeding \nTASF replenishment). Detailed cost estimates and financing arrangements will be presented in \neach TA subproject proposal submitted for approval. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA cluster. ERMR will directly handle TA cluster administration \nand supervision, management of consultants, procurement, and accomplishment of outputs. \nAdopting the One ADB approach in knowledge solutions, ERMR will continue to collaborate with \nregional departments, including resident missions; other knowledge departments; and relevant \nsector and thematic groups on activities under each subproject. Each TA subproject proposal \nwill be submitted for approval to the ERCD chief economist and director general, following the \nbusiness process for knowledge and support TA cluster.9 Subproject activities will start only \nafter  approval  of  each  TA  subproject  proposal.

Consulting services. The TA cluster will require international consulting services from \neconomists and sector specialists who will prepare background papers and analyses supporting \nthe thematic chapters or topics related to the outlook. International economic advisory and \nediting consultants will perform economic and technical editing of ADO manuscripts before final \npublication.  National  economics  consultants  and  research  assistants  will  provide  data \nmanagement assistance and conduct research on particular topics. National consultants will be \nneeded for the desktop publishing and graphic design of the publication. Resource persons will \nbe engaged for a maximum of 15 working days each to conduct training on macroeconomics \nand  economic  forecasting  and  also  serve  as  discussants  during  workshops.  Contracts  for \nconsulting services will consist of output-based, lump-sum, time-based or framework contracts, \nas appropriate, and the consultants and resource persons will be recruited as individuals to \nensure  individuals  with  the requisite  experience  and qualifications  are recruited. The  ADO \ncovers a wide range of topics, and highly qualified consultants with expertise relevant to ADO \nrequirements will most likely be associated with various research institutions, think tanks, and \nuniversities. Further, the TA will require rapid mobilization of the editorial consultants. The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as \namended from time to time) and the associated staff instructions. \n \n18.  Knowledge  partnerships. ERCD will seek to collaborate with reputable centers of \nexcellence during the conduct of research and implementation, and these may be engaged \nthrough knowledge partnership agreements (KPAs). Specific entities will be identified during TA \ncluster  implementation.  A  nomination  proposal  will  be  prepared  for  proposed  knowledge \npartners, and the corresponding KPA will be finalized prior to approval of each TA subproject. \nWhere knowledge partners are identified after TA subproject approval, ERCD will prepare a \nminor change in implementation arrangements following para. 6 of the Staff Instruction on \nBusiness Processes for Knowledge Partnerships under Technical Assistance Operations.10 All \nKPAs will be processed following the staff instruction. \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s procurement. The TA cluster will finance procurement of information technology \nequipment and software as needed. Procurement will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, \nas amended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as \namended from time to time). \n \nV.
