The Government has made persistent \nefforts  to  modernize  and  transform  the  financial  sector, \nrecognizing  its  significance  to  the  country\u2019s  economic \nperformance. Still, plagued by many factors inherited from the \nformer  regime,  the  formal  financial  system  remains \nunderdeveloped, inefficient, and inaccessible to many. \n \nFinancial intermediation, dominated by bank savings and loans, is \nlow. The banking subsector alone, with its high-levels of non-\nperforming loans, is unable to fully support economic development \nand employment generation of the country. The Government has \ninitiated the process for financial and operational restructuring of \nthe  banking  subsector  with  the  assistance  from  International \nMonetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank under poverty reduction \nand growth facility (PRGF) and poverty reduction support credit \n(PRSC) in June 2001. To complement this process, there is an \nurgent  need  to  develop  alternative  channels  of  financial \nintermediation  in  support  of  Viet  Nam's  broad-based economic \ngrowth  and  socioeconomic  development  objectives,  including \npoverty reduction. \n \n  The FSPL II, building on achievements of the FSPL I, will support \nthe  Government's  effort  to  develop  alternative  channels  of \nfinancial intermediation such as money/capital markets, insurance \nand leasing subsectors, and financial infrastructure to enhance \npublic confidence in the system. The nonbanking subsector and \ncapital market will provide long-term funds and investment capital, \n ", "iii \nlargely lacking in Viet Nam. Higher efficiency may be achieved \nthrough increased competition from the nonbanking subsector. \nMoreover, the financial system as a whole will be broadened and \nbetter  balanced,  building  resilience  to  unfavorable  exogenous \nshocks. \n   \nObjectives and  The objective is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to enable the \nScope  development  of  alternative  channels  of  market-based  financial \nintermediation.  Necessary  components  include  (i)  economic \npolicies  conducive  to  sound  and  vibrant  development  of  the \nfinancial  sector;  (ii)  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  that  will \npromote innovation and healthy competition while simultaneously \nmonitoring and reducing systemic risks; (iii) regulators with the \nauthority, budget, skills, and established procedures to monitor \nand  enforce  regulations;  and  (iv)  supporting  financial \ninfrastructure. \n \nTo achieve the objective, the FSPL II focuses on \n \n(i)  establishing  a  regulatory  framework  for  insurance \nbusiness,  strengthening  the  supervisory  and  regulatory \nframeworks,  and  promoting  the  development  of  key \nprofessionals; \n(ii)  promoting  the  leasing  industry  by  creating  a  coherent \nregulatory  framework,  establishing  ground  rules  for \ncontract enforcement, and enhanced public awareness; \n(iii)  enabling  interbank  and  money  market  development \nthrough  phased  interest  rate  deregulation,  increased \nmoney  market  instruments,  and  development  of  the \nmarket microstructure; \n(iv)  fostering  capital  market\u2019s  financial  intermediation  by \n(a) establishing incentives compatible with the regulatory \nframework for increasing quality shares on the market, \n(b) strengthening  the  market  surveillance  system,  and \n(c) building the basis for institutional investors; and  \n(v)  continuing to support financial infrastructures, such as the \naccounting  and  auditing  systems,  secured  transactions \nsystem, deposit insurance system (assisted under FSPL I); \nand  initiating  the  process  for  building  an  anti-money- \nlaundering regime in Viet Nam. \n \n  Subprograms II and III will be presented for Board consideration, \nbased  on  progress  in  implementing  subprogram  I.  Policy \nconditions for subprogram II are subject to revision to reflect the \nGovernment's achievements and changing policy environment. \nSubprogram  III  will  be  processed  in  a  similar  manner. \nSubprograms II and III will be implemented within 27 months and \n ", "iv \n39 months after loan effectiveness of subprogram I, respectively.  \n   \nProgram Period and  The period for the program cluster and subprogram I will be 39 \nTranching  months and 15 months, respectively, from loan effectiveness. The \nloan for subprogam I will be utilized within 18 months from the \ndate of loan effectiveness.  \n \nThe loan for subprogram I of $50 million will be from the Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF), released in two tranches: (i) $20 million \nupon fulfillment of specified first tranche release conditions, and \n(ii) $30 million subject to fulfillment of specified second tranche \nrelease  conditions.  The  review  for  second  tranche  release  is \nexpected to coincide with subprogram II loan fact-finding. The \ntranching for the proposed loans for subprograms II ($10 million) \nand III ($15 million), will be determined subsequent to completion \nof subprogram I.  \n \n   \nExecuting Agency  The State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) will be the Executing Agency \nfor the FSPL II. To coordinate program implementation among \ngovernment  ministries  and  agencies  concerned,  a  program \nsteering committee (PSC) will be formed. The PSC, chaired by a \ndeputy governor of SBV, will comprise senior officers from all \nministries  and  government  agencies  concerned.  The  PSC  will \nmeet twice yearly and on an ad hoc basis to review pending \nissues and propose concrete actions for their resolution to ensure \ntimely program implementation. A program implementation and \ncoordination unit will be formed within SBV, headed by a senior \nofficer of SBV, to assist the PSC and Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) in implementing the Program.  \n   \nProcurement  The proceeds of the FSPL II will be disbursed for a broad range of \nimports,  subject  to  a  negative  list  of  ineligible  items.  All \nprocurement of goods and services produced in and originating \nfrom  member  countries  of  ADB  will  be  made  with  due \nconsideration  to  economy  and  efficiency  in  accordance  with \nstandard public sector procedures in Viet Nam and normal private \nsector commercial practices, acceptable to ADB. The Borrower \nwill certify that the value of total imports minus (i) imports from \nnonmember  countries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii) \ndisbursements made under other official development assistance, \nis greater than the amount expected to be disbursed during the \nyear.  ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds \nand to verify the accuracy of the Borrower's certification. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The  policy  framework  for  the  FSPL  II  includes  specific \ncomponents that bear distinct costs of structural adjustments. The \ncounterpart funds to  be generated from loan proceeds will be \nused to finance the structural adjustment costs arising from the \nFSPL II. \n   \n ", "v \nRisks and Safeguards  The FSPL II faces three principal risks. The first is the resurfacing \nof sociopolitical pressure, which could delay the FSPL II\u2019s reform \nprocess. Materialization of this risk is contingent on the economic \nperformance of Viet Nam. Judging from the current status of the \nVietnamese  economy  and  its  outlook,  and  the  proreform \nstatements and achievements made by the present Government \nwith full public support, this risk is currently limited. Nevertheless, \nmacroeconomic conditions and the sociopolitical situation of the \ncountry will be closely monitored against program objectives. The \nproposed reform measures will be fine-tuned under the program \ncluster modality to ensure successful implementation.  \n \nThe second risk relates to the progress in restructuring banks and \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs), which weighs heavily on Viet \nNam\u2019s  financial  sector.  There  remain  numerous  technical \ndifficulties that must be overcome and the slower-than-expected \nprogress  will  have  implications  on  achieving  the  objectives  of \nFSPL II. However, the comprehensive frameworks developed by \nIMF  and  the  World  Bank  under  the  PRGF  and  PRSC  for \nrestructuring banks and SOEs  and associated technical support \nfrom  bilateral  agencies  have  considerably  mitigated  this  risk. \nCoordination  between  ADB,  IMF,  and  the  World  Bank  will \ncontinue  to  synchronize  the  subsectoral  reform  measures  for \nachieving full benefits from the FSPL II. \n \nThe third risk pertains to the technical capacities of implementing \nagencies. The Government\u2019s track record suggests that, given \nadequate  technical  support,  its  commitment  to  undertake  the \nproposed  reforms  is  strong.  In  implementing  the  FSPL  I,  for \nexample,  delays  were  caused  predominantly  by  the  lack  of \ntechnical expertise in the financial sector, particularly for drafting \nlaws, rules, and regulations. The delays were exacerbated by the \nconsensus building approach taken for their enactment, requiring \ninter-ministerial coordination. To reduce this risk in the FSPL II, \ncomprehensive  discussions  were  undertaken  with  the \nimplementing agencies and technical assistance (TA) for capacity \nbuilding  for  non-bank  financial  institutions  and  capital  market \n(proposed  for  2003,  standby  2002)  will  tackle  the  technical \ndifficulties  anticipated  with  implementing  the  policy  actions \nproposed under the Program.   \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster for the Second Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL II), and (ii) a proposed \nloan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for subprogram I of the FSPL II. \n   \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  Doi moi (renovation), adopted in 1986, launched Viet Nam\u2019s transition from a centrally \nplanned  economic  system  to  a  multisector  socialist-oriented  market  economy.  Economic \nliberalization, particularly in agriculture, led to strong productivity increases and diversification, \nturning Viet Nam into the world\u2019s second largest rice exporter. Greater market orientation has \nbeen accompanied by structural transformation. Agriculture\u2019s share in gross domestic product \n(GDP) is declining, but the sector still accounts for the largest share of employment, with \nagriculture accounting for approximately 22% of GDP and 60% of employment in 2001. The \nindustry and services sectors have expanded, particularly in urban areas, and foreign direct \ninvestment (FDI) inflows and official development assistance have augmented domestic savings \nin financing development. Liberalization has been accompanied by significant poverty reduction, \nand the proportion of the population below the poverty line is estimated to have declined from \n58% in 1992-1993 to around 32% in FY2000. \n \n3.  Viet Nam\u2019s economic performance over the past decade has generally been strong. \nDuring 1992-1997, GDP grew at an average annual rate of 8.8%. The high growth period was \nfollowed by two years of economic slowdown during 1998-1999, when the average annual GDP \ngrowth rate fell by almost half to 4.6%. A rebound started in 2000, and GDP grew by about 6% \nin  both  2000  and  2001,  supported  by  strong  domestic  demand  and  expansion  of  public \ninvestment. Prudent macroeconomic management has: (i) kept inflation in check (less than 1% \nannually since 1999); (ii) maintained fiscal deficits within manageable limits (less than 3% of \nGDP in 1998-2000,  and  4.9%  in  2001);  (iii) transformed high balance-of-payments current \naccount deficits into surpluses since 1999; and (iv) set external debt accumulation on a more \nsustainable path (by reducing the debt-service ratio to around 10% of GDP in 2001). In recent \nmonths, the nominal exchange rate has been allowed to depreciate at a faster rate, but the real \neffective exchange rate has still appreciated as a result of stronger depreciation in partner \ncountries. Viet Nam remains vulnerable to external shocks because the relatively concentrated \nexport  base  with  dependence  on  crude  oil  and  agricultural  commodity  exports,  leaves  it \nexposed to volatility in world commodity prices. Also, since two thirds of FDI originate from \nAsian countries, Viet Nam is dependent on the growth outlook of its regional partners.  \n \n4.  Preliminary data suggest that during the first quarter of 2002 GDP grew by 6.6% \ncompared to the same period last year, with inflation at 2.5%. Exports and imports performance \nwas worse that anticipated, with 12% decline and 2.5% growth respectively, largely due to a fall \nin volume of oil and agriculture exports. Viet Nam\u2019s medium-term growth outlook is cautiously \noptimistic. GDP is projected to grow by 6.2% in 2002 and by 6.8% in 2003. Official projections \nare of 7.0-7.3% growth in 2002, while the 2001-2005 plan set an average growth rate target of \nabout  7.5%.  The  lagged  impact  of  the  fall  of  interest  rates  and  the  improved  business \nenvironment should provide impetus for further development of the private sector. The fiscal \nstimulus is expected to continue and the budget deficit may increase, due also to the impact of \nthe accelerating state-owned enterprise (SOE) and banking reforms. The current account, \nexcluding official transfers, is projected to record a modest surplus in 2002 and a small deficit in \n2003,  as  imports  pick  up  along  with  the  expected  economic  recovery.  Inflation  rates  are \n ", "2 \nexpected to increase, but to remain below 4%. Given the attempt to reduce nonperforming loans \n(NPLs) and to strengthen risk management of banks, credit restraint is expected to continue. \n \n5.  Economic and structural reforms, which had slowed down in the wake of the 1997 Asian \ncrisis, have again gathered momentum. The Government has committed, through the Bilateral \nTrade Agreement with the United States and the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement to significant \ntrade liberalization, which should provide a strong challenge to increase the competitiveness of \ndomestic and public enterprises. Simplified registration requirements under the new Enterprise \nLaw adopted in 2000 led to a surge in the number of small private enterprises. Banking sector \n(and to a lesser extent SOE) reforms have been initiated, and a public administration reform \nmaster plan was approved in November 2001. Given the uncertain international economic \nenvironment and its impact on FDI inflows, Viet Nam will need to rely on domestic savings to \nsustain rapid growth rates. Improving the efficiency of the financial system and developing a \nvariety of channels for financing of private enterprises is an important requirement in order to \nsustain savings mobilization and growth. \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n1.  Overview \n6.  The current Vietnamese financial sector mirrors its economy and is in a transitional \nphase. Financial sector reforms since the onset of doi moi, have created a two-tier banking \nsystem, established the basic legal frameworks for central and commercial bank operations, \nand initiated the development of financial infrastructures such as the credit information bureau \nand the payment system. The Government has made persistent efforts to modernize and \ntransform  the  financial  sector,  recognizing  its  significance  to  the  country\u2019s  economic \nperformance.  Still,  plagued  by  many  factors  inherited  from  the  former  regime,  the  formal \nfinancial system remains underdeveloped, inefficient, and inaccessible to many. \n \n7.  Financial intermediation is low and the current structure inhibits economic development \nand employment generation. Domestic financial resource mobilization has been limited, with \ngross domestic saving to GDP ratio at 24% in 2001. Within the financial sector the banks are \ndominant with total assets accounting for more than 70% of GDP. The nonbanking sector, on \nthe other hand, is still at a nascent stage, with assets less than 3% of total bank assets, and will \nrequire substantial technical and financial support for proper development. Appendix 1 presents \nthe plan for financial sector development. \n \n2.  Banking Subsector \n8.  The number of banks increased during the last decade due to deregulatory measures \nadopted  by  the  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam  (SBV).  However,  state-owned commercial banks \n(SOCBs) continue to dominate the subsector despite their lackluster performance. Currently, the \nbanking subsector comprises 6 SOCBs, 38 joint stock commercial banks (JSCBs), 4 joint \nventure banks, 23 foreign bank branches, and 80 foreign bank representative offices. The four \nmajor SOCBs accounted for 73% of total bank assets as of December 2001, while JSCBs \naccounted for 10.7%, and foreign branch offices and joint venture banks together accounted for \n15.3% of total bank assets. For credit, SOCBs provide 72% of total bank loans in the economy. \nApproximately  45%  of  SOCBs\u2019  credit  is  channeled  to  SOEs,  with  a  substantial  amount \nnonperforming. Efficiency is low, particularly for SOCBs operating large branch networks without \n ", "3 \nadequate management information systems and performance measurement standards. The \npoor asset quality and inefficient operation have caused SOCBs\u2019 profitability to deteriorate, and \nfinancial returns on assets averaged \u20130.2% and the capital-to-assets ratio stood at 6% as of \nDecember 2001, as measured using the Vietnamese accounting system. \n \n9.  In May 1998, a bank restructuring committee, headed by a SBV deputy governor, began \nplanning for restructuring in the banking subsector. A plan was formulated with the assistance of \nthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, and consists of a five-track reform \nprogram: (i) improving the legal, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks; (ii) providing equal \nopportunities for all banks; (iii) restructuring  JSCBs;  (iv)  restructuring  and  commercializing \nSOCBs;  and  (v)  training  management  and  staff  in  commercial  banking  and  central  bank \nsupervision. In support of its implementation, IMF and World Bank provided a poverty reduction \nand growth facility (PRGF) and poverty reduction support credit (PRSC) in 2001.1 The banking \nsector is being restructured under the PRGF-PRSC framework. The financial statements of the \nfour major SOCBs have been audited in accordance with International Accounting Standards \n(IAS) and efforts will now concentrate on resolving NPLs. \n \n3.  Nonbanking Subsector \n10.  The nonbanking subsector, represented by insurance and leasing, is in its nascent stage \nof development. While the size of the two industries is still small, their growth rates have been \nexceptional,  evidence  of  the  economy\u2019s  readiness  for  alternatives  to  traditional  financial \nproducts and services offered by banks. \n \n11.  The new Law on Insurance Business became effective on 1 April 2001. The law is \ncomprehensive, covering licensing procedures, insurance contracts, and investment guidelines. \nWhile  the  new  law  has  provided  a  good  starting  point,  gaps  must  be  filled  to  balance \ncompetition and innovation in the industry with prevention of market failures, stemming from \nmarket  misconduct  and  lack  of  wide  access  to  information.  Of  utmost  importance  is \nstrengthening the legal framework and institutional capacity of the regulator, currently the \nInsurance Management Division of the Ministry of Finance (MOF). \n \n12.  There are 18 insurance companies, 4 state-owned insurers, 4 joint-stock companies, 5 \njoint ventures, and 5 wholly-owned  foreign  companies  operating  in  Viet  Nam,  with  assets \ntotaling D5,092 billion ($333 million) in 2000. Although the private sector\u2019s market share is on \nthe rise, the state-owned insurer, Bao Viet remains the dominant player, with nonlife and life \nmarket  shares  of  approximately  47%  and  55%,  respectively,  in  FY2001.  The  insurance \ncoverage, measuring the annual insurance premiums written to GDP, is still low at 1.0% of GDP \nin 2001 compared to 6.5% in OECD countries as of 2000.2 However, its growth, stimulated by \nthe enactment of the new law, has been phenomenal. The gross domestic insurance premiums \nhave grown at an average rate of 30% per annum, reaching an estimated D4.9 trillion ($321 \nmillion) in 2001. \n \n13.  Viet Nam has eight finance leasing companies, three of which are joint ventures with \nforeign investors or wholly foreign owned and five are subsidiaries of SOCBs. The leased asset \nfor 2001 is estimated to have amounted to D2 trillion ($131 million). A new decree, Decree 16, \n                                                 \n1  IMF approved a PRGF for SDR290 million ($368 million equivalent) on 6 April 2001 and the World Bank approved \na PRSC for $250 million on 4 June 2001. The areas of reform are comprehensive, covering the private sector, \nSOEs, banking, trade, and public expenditure management. \n2  In 2000, the ratio was 1.42 in Indonesia, 3.88 in Malaysia, 1.37 in the Philippines, 1.63 in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, and 2.27 in Thailand. \n ", "4 \nreplaced a temporary decree on 17 May 2001 to address some impediments that became \napparent during the implementation of the temporary decree. Among others, the new decree \nallows lease transactions with individuals, substantially expanding the customer base. The \nimplementing circular stipulates the minimum paid-up capital for domestic and foreign leasing \ncompanies of D50 billion ($3.2 million) and $5 million, respectively. Gaps in the legal framework \nremain to be filled, particularly regarding procedures for enforcing leasing contracts at times of \ndefault.  Furthermore,  to  promote  the  leasing  industry,  interministerial  coordination  and \ncooperation to streamline rules and regulations will be essential. More efforts will be needed to \npromote the concept of leasing, still new to Viet Nam. \n \n4.  Interbank, Money, and Capital Markets \n14.  The interbank, money, and capital markets are similarly at their rudimentary stages of \ndevelopment. While the basic architectures are in place, the markets remain thin with limited \nsupply of commodities for trading. For all interbank, money, and capital markets, there is \nconsiderable scope for consolidating the legal and regulatory frameworks and improving their \nmarket microstructures. The money market instruments comprise treasury bills issued by MOF \nand SBV bills issued by SBV. Actual money market transactions, particularly on the secondary \nmarket, remain insignificant. Treasury bills issued by MOF in 2001 amounted to D3.955 trillion \n($259 million). \n \n15.  Likewise, trading for equities and bonds on the Securities Trading Center (STC) is still \nlimited. After over 5 years of meticulous planning and enactment of an extensive legal and \nregulatory framework for listed securities, STC opened on 28 July 2000 in Ho Chi Minh. \nCurrently 19 companies and 18 bonds are listed on STC, with total market capitalization of \nD1.6 trillion ($105 million). Companies listed are all former SOEs transformed into joint stock \ncompanies (JSCs)3 under Decree 44 on equitization of SOEs. Daily trading volume averaged \n202,175  shares  and  turnover  value  averaged  D123.5  million  ($8,095)  in  April  2002.  STC \nupgraded  its  trading  system  in  December  2001  and  intends  to  establish a clearing and \nsettlement system consistent with the best international practices by 2005. \n \n16.  Decree 48 on Securities and Securities Markets and the decision of the Prime Minister \non the establishment issued on 11 July 1998 provide the basic legal framework for the capital \nmarket. It mandates the State Securities Commission (SSC) to develop standards for listing, set \ninformation disclosure requirements, regulate securities trading, supervise STC, and grant and \nwithdraw licensing to securities and fund management companies. SSC has granted operational \nlicenses  to  eight  securities  companies  but  none  for  fund  management.  The  securities \ncompanies  are  subject  to  SSC's  prudential  and  regulatory  safeguards  including  market \nsurveillance and on-site inspection of securities companies.  \n \n5.  Market Infrastructure \n17.  The basic infrastructure and safety nets for the banking subsector are being developed. \nFor the clearing and payment system, SBV has initiated a major project to build a nationwide \nreal-time gross settlement system with World Bank assistance. The Credit Information Center \nsupported under the FSPL I is operating with standardized credit documentation, reports, and a \ndatabase, which allows for compilation, distribution, storage, and retrieval of credit information. \n                                                 \n3  A JSC is an enterprise whereby the charter capital is divided into equal portions called shares. A JSC must have a \nminimum of three shareholders, who may be organizations or individuals, and who are liable for the debts and \nother property obligations within the amount of capital contributed to the company. \n ", "5 \nThe system encompasses an early warning system, flagging high credit risk and problem \naccounts to financial institutions. The Deposit Insurance of Vietnam was established in June \n2000, also with the support of the FSPL I, and currently insures deposits of all commercial \nbanks and 930 people\u2019s credit funds up to a maximum of D30 million ($1,966). A first payment \nwas made to the depositors of a failed People\u2019s Credit Fund in 2001. \n \n18.  The fundamental infrastructure for building a sound and efficient financial sector, such as \nan accounting and auditing system, and basic laws on bankruptcy, contract enforcement, \ncollateral,  and  loan  recovery  are  being  gradually  developed.  The  Accounting  and  Policy \nDepartment of MOF is drafting the Vietnamese Accounting Law. The Vietnamese accounting \nstandards are being developed based on IAS, taking into account Vietnam's specific conditions. \nThey are scheduled to be completed  by the end of 2004. The Bankruptcy Law with Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)4 assistance will be submitted to the technical committee of the \nNational Assembly in November 2002. Also, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) plans to draft and \nsubmit a comprehensive secured transactions law. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n19.  Given the dominance of banks in the Vietnamese financial system, their restructuring is \na priority for financial sector development. The IMF and World Bank are providing assistance to \nthe Government for bank restructuring and have embarked on implementation of a policy \nframework developed as a PRGF-PRSC. The framework aims to increase commercial banks' \ntransparency  and  accountability  by  firstly  ascertaining  that  the  SOCBs  separate  policy  or \ndirected lending from commercial lending and phase out noncommercial lending. The process \ncalls for a phased recapitalization of the four major SOCBs, conditional on implementing key \nactions  and  meeting  operational  targets  set  annually  in  accordance  with  SBV-approved \nrestructuring plans. These actions include the resolution of NPLs and improvement in SOCBs\u2019 \nprofitability. \n \n20.  To support economic growth, there is an urgent need to complement this process by \ndeveloping alternative channels of financial intermediation to bank saving and loans. The capital \nmarket and the nonbanking subsector could provide funds, particularly long-term funds and \ninvestment capital, to the growing private sector. Providing financial resources efficiently to this \nsubsector of the economy would be integral for sustaining economic growth and employment \ngeneration in Viet Nam. \n \n21.  Such financing alternatives will complement the banks whose functions are constrained \nby their financial restructuring. Conversely, interbank and money markets will provide the means \nto increase banks' efficiency through more effective liquidity management and thereby reducing \nopportunity costs of holding assets that are not earning interest. Capital market also could give \nthe banks options for resolving their NPLs, such as securitization. More importantly, however, \ndevelopment of the nonbanking subsector, interbank, money, and capital market will bring \ncompetition to banks and thus indirectly induce greater efficiencies.  \n \n22.  Weaknesses in the policy environment continue to impede innovations in markets. \nAdditionally,  inadequate  regulatory  capacity  and  financial  markets  infrastructure  limits \nconfidence in markets and institutions. To foster money market development, Viet Nam has \n                                                 \n4  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2000. Technical Assistance to Viet Nam for Revising of Bankruptcy Law Support \nProject. Manila. The objective is to help the Government revise the Bankruptcy Law and the implementation \ndecree. \n ", "6 \ntaken the first critical step of removing direct control of commercial lending rates, which caused \nmarket distortions and reduced incentives to actively participate in the money market. Flexible \ninterest rates are a requisite for money market development. Still, a market-based benchmark \ninterest rate has yet to evolve, as treasury and SBV bill pricing is not completely market-driven. \nWithout a market-based risk-free interest rate, pricing for other financial products, particularly \nmoney market instruments, is problematic.  \n \n23.  In the insurance subsector, strengthening the Insurance Management Division of MOF, \nto monitor and regulate the insurance industry is a matter of high priority. Currently it has 12 \nstaff, with limited supervisory experience. Off-site surveillance and on-site inspection are being \nconducted on an annual basis. Frequency and quality of surveillance are constrained by the \nnumber of qualified staff in the Insurance Management Division as well as its statutory power. \nAlso, the industry suffers from lack of key professionals. At present, there are no actuaries in \nViet Nam. While training is ongoing at the corporate level, fostering actuaries as professionals \nwith high aptitudes is integral to pension and insurance sector development. Furthermore, there \nare  no  loss  assessors.  The  qualifications  or  standards  for  sales  agents  have  yet  to  be \ndeveloped, putting the public directly interfacing with them at risk. Lack of competent working \nprofessionals is a primary impediment for developing the insurance subsector in Viet Nam. \nDeveloping human capital will require time and must rigorously be supported by the industry as \nwell as the Government.  \n \n24.  The major issue for the capital market is the scarcity of listed companies. Currently, the \ndemand for listed shares overwhelms the supply, distorting stock prices relative to corporate \nvalue.  Although  the  SOE  equitization  program  has  created  over  700  JSCs,  of  which \napproximately 350 have external public shareholders, 70 to 80 meet listing criteria, and only 19 \nJSCs have been listed thus far. Many unlisted companies are actively traded on the informal \nmarket. This phenomenon has been created partly by the lack of linkage between SOEs' \nequitization program and STC listing. Also, gaps in the current capital market regulations must \nbe addressed, particularly in ensuring a regulatory system that is effective with credible use of \ninspection, investigation, and surveillance. To ensure proper sequencing of development under \na strategic framework, ADB is providing assistance to the Government in preparing a plan for \ncapital market development. A consultant engaged for initial drafting presented the plan to SSC \nofficials in June 2002 and a workshop was held on 27 August 2002 for final discussions with \nsenior officials of SSC (Supplementary Appendix B on Capital Markets Development Roadmap). \nSSC is prepared to adopt the plan as its 10-year development plan after fine tuning. The FSPL \nII has incorporated the plan in its design and will set in motion its first phase. \n \n25.  The FSPL II is also designed to build on past interventions while simultaneously looking \nforward to future programs in an effort to structure smooth interventions in the sector. The \nFSPL I5 initiated the work on nonbanking and capital market development. The FSPL I aimed to \n(i) establish the essential market infrastructure to facilitate private sector participation in relation \nto the legal and regulatory framework, the accounting and audit system for banks, information \ndisclosure  and  investor  protection;  (ii)  commercialize  and  modernize  domestic  banking \noperations by providing greater autonomy to the SOCBs; (iii) promote equal competition and \ndiversify the range of financial institutions; and (iv) initiate the development of the capital market \nby promulgating basic securities legislation and establishing a securities agency to regulate and \ndevelop the market for securities. The loan was closed in December 1999. ADB\u2019s continued \nsupport in these subsectors is designed to strategically broaden the financial sector.  \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1996. Financial Sector Program Loan I (approved on 19 November 1996, for $90 million). Manila. \n ", "7 \n26.  Elements  to  specifically  enhance  governance  of  the  financial  system  are  also \nincorporated throughout the Program, in continuation of policy actions supported under State-\nOwned Enterprise Reform and Corporate Governance Program Loan (SCPL).6 The SCPL \naimed to (i) improve the environment for foreign investment; (ii) provide enterprises with greater \naccess to foreign investment and credit; (iii) accelerate SOE reform by strengthening the \ninstitutional  and  policy  framework  for  SOE  reform,  improving  corporate  governance  of \nenterprises and imposing financial discipline on SOEs; and (iv) enhance labor mobility to \nfacilitate SOE reform by making the social insurance system more flexible. Institutionalizing \ngood  governance  is  key  to  avoiding  problems  confronting  the  present  banking  system. \nFurthermore, the FSPL II includes factors to ease the access of small- and medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs)  to  financial  resources,  with  the  intention  to  initiate  action  that  will \nappropriately link to a SME development program loan, in ADB\u2019s pipeline for 2004. This \napproach to financial sector development has been substantiated by the Viet Nam Country \nStrategy and Program (2002\u20132004), Strategic Priorities for ADB Assistance.7 \n \n27.  In building financial infrastructure, the FSPL II focuses on the following key areas \nrequiring support: (i) accounting and auditing systems, (ii) secured transactions system, (iii) a  \ndeposit  insurance  system,  and  (iv)  anti-money-laundering  measures.  These  systems  and \nmeasures are strategic bottlenecks for the nonbanking subsector, markets, and real sector \ntransactions. Assisting in the development of these essential financial infrastructure is also in \ncontinuation with the work initiated under FSPL I.  \n \n28.  Viet  Nam  is  at  a  critical  juncture  of  adopting  accounting  and  auditing  standards \nconsistent with international practices. Considerable effort will be required for (i) ensuring \nadherence to the new standards and the quality of audit; and (ii) promoting their use for \nperformance measurement as well as assessment of expected risks and returns, relevant \nparticularly for transactions in capital market. ADB supported development of the accounting \nand auditing systems under the FSPL I and SCPL. The FSPL II will continue support in this key \nfinancial infrastructure. \n \n29.  Deposit insurance and secured transactions systems initiated under the FSPL I have \nbeen  identified  as  areas  that  will  require  additional  assistance  by  the  FSPL  I  program \ncompletion report.8 Given the proven ownership and commitment of the Government, there is a \nstrong basis for continuing ADB's support for deposit insurance and secured transactions \nsystems under the FSPL II. Both the registry for secured transactions and deposit insurance \nsystems are deemed essential for improving public confidence in the financial system. The two \nsystems are in their initial operating stages and must overcome technical difficulties. Adopting \nanti-money-laundering measures is included under the FSPL II in recognition of its importance \nfor the financial system in Viet Nam, prevention of corruption, promotion of good governance, \nand the well being of the global community at large. The four targeted areas of financial market \ninfrastructure under the FSPL II will all support building public confidence in the financial system \nof Viet Nam. \n \n30.   Lessons  learned  from  ADB's  experience  in  program  lending  for  financial  sector \ndevelopment, particularly the FSPL I, were fully considered in designing the FSPL II. The \nlessons include that (i) policy reform involves substantial learning and capacity building in Viet \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 1999.

Manila. \n ", "8 \nNam; (ii) reforms that require coordination between government bodies take time, suggesting \nthe need for more flexibility in the design of reforms; and (iii) establishing and maintaining the \nreform process is as important as immediate program outcomes. The FSPL II takes a phased \napproach to legal reforms in order to cope with complexities involved in developing a viable \nlegal framework for a country in transition. Also, recognizing that the creation of a sound \nfinancial system requires systematic reforms and thus time, a long-term approach is taken with \nan emphasis on initiating and maintaining the process of reforms in each of the subsectors. \nMoreover, a program cluster approach is proposed to allow for more flexibility to take into \naccount the evolving economic environment, the impact of initial policy actions against planned \nobjectives, and the results of capacity building efforts before proceeding with further reforms.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n31.  The objective is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to build an enabling environment for \ndeveloping  alternative  channels  of  market-based  financial  intermediation.  Necessary \ncomponents for an enabling environment include (i) economic policies conducive to sound and \nvibrant development of the financial sector; (ii) legal and regulatory frameworks that will promote \ninnovation and healthy competition while simultaneously monitoring and reducing systemic \nrisks; (iii) regulators with the authority, budget, skills, and established procedures to monitor and \nenforce regulations; and (iv) support for financial infrastructure. \n \n32.  To achieve the objective, the FSPL II focuses on: \n \n(i)  establishing a regulatory framework for insurance business, strengthening the \nsupervisory and regulatory frameworks, and promoting the development of key \nprofessionals; \n(ii)  promoting the leasing industry by creating a coherent regulatory framework, \nestablishing  ground  rules  for  contract  enforcement,  and  enhancing  public \nawareness; \n(iii)  enabling interbank and money market development through deregulating interest \nrates in a phased manner, increasing money market instruments, and developing \nmarket microstructure; \n(iv)  fostering capital market financial intermediation by (a) establishing incentives \ncompatible with the regulatory framework for increasing quality shares on the \nmarket, (b) strengthening the market surveillance system, and (c) building the \nbasis for institutional investors; and  \n(v)  continuing  to  build  financial  infrastructure  such  as  accounting  and  auditing \nsystems, secured transactions system, deposit insurance system, and an anti-\nmoney-laundering regime. \n33.  Continuation of the present stability in Viet Nam's macroeconomy is a precondition for \nsuccess of the proposed reforms in the financial sector. Macroeconomic stability is being closely \nmonitored under IMF's PRGF. Furthermore, deregulatory measures toward interest rate and \n ", "9 \nexchange rate management being adopted by the Government are the basis for an environment \nconducive to developing alternative channels of market-based financial intermediation. \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n34.  Reforms to be implemented in each component of FSPL II are presented in the policy \nmatrix (Appendix 2) and the program framework (Appendix 3).  A discussion on key policy \nmeasures follows. \n \n1.  Insurance Sector Development \n35.  To  foster  the  development  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  emerging  insurance  sector,  the  FSPL  II \nsupports: (i) creating a competitive business environment, (ii) enhancing corporate governance \nof  insurance  companies,  (iii)  strengthening  supervision  and  prudential  regulations,  and \n(iv) developing insurance infrastructure. \n \na.  Creating a Competitive Business Environment \n36.  Deregulatory measures will be adopted to create a competitive business environment for \nthe industry in a phased manner. The FSPL II will streamline the approval system for changes in \nthe operation of insurance companies, opening of new branches, and introduction of new \nproducts. Furthermore, the FSPL II will increase competitiveness of the industry by ensuring \nthat licenses are granted to brokers regardless of their ownership form and that compulsory \nreinsurance to the national reinsurer of Viet Nam is gradually phased out. MOF will also provide \nincentive for insurance companies to develop new products and issue terms and conditions of \ninsurance and tariffs for each class of compulsory insurance. \n \nb.  Enhancing Corporate Governance of Insurance Companies \n37.  For promoting a competitive market, the Government\u2019s role in the industry must be \nclearly defined and limited to that of a regulator and a promoter of the nascent industry. The \nFSPL II will support the Government to improve corporate governance through submission of a \nplan that includes review of ownership structure of state-owned insurance companies and joint \nstock insurance companies. \n \nc.  Strengthening Supervision and Prudential Regulations \n38.   The  limited  capacity  of  MOF\u2019s  Insurance  Management  Division  poses  a  concern \nregarding its ability to fulfill its role as a regulator for promoting sound business practices and \nprotect consumers from undue risk with insurance products. There is an urgent need to build the \nsupervisory capacity, particularly in view of the industry's rapid growth. The FSPL II will support \nadoption  of:  (i)  procedures  for  on-site  inspection  and  off-site  surveillance  for  insurance \ncompanies;  (ii)  an  accounting  system  for  insurance  companies;  (iii)  detailed  sanction \nmechanisms for administrative violations in insurance businesses; (iv) an early warning system; \n(v) procedures to deal with problem insurance companies; and (vi) risk-based capital regulation \nfor insurance companies. \n \n39.  The organization structure of the Insurance Management Division will be strengthened \nwith the establishment of a supervisory body under MOF. Given the current regulatory capacity, \na phased approach is proposed for establishing a supervisory body under MOF in the insurance \nsubsector.  \n ", "10 \nd.  Developing Insurance Infrastructure \n40.   Under the FSPL II, initiatives will be taken to establish an insurance department in the \nFinance Institute through a public-private partnership. MOF will endorse plans for development \nof insurance actuaries and loss adjusters submitted by insurance companies to raise the \nnumber and quality of actuaries and loss assessors and devise a code of conduct for insurance \nbrokers and agents in consultation with Viet Nam Insurance Association. Cooperation between \nthe Government and insurance companies is essential for obtaining an adequate number of \nqualified professionals in the insurance subsector, and for ensuring the subsector's sound and \nefficient operation. \n \n2.  Leasing Sector Development \n41.  The  leasing  industry  is  of  strategic  importance  to  Viet  Nam.  Leasing  can provide \nalternative financing vehicles to SMEs, whose access to term financing for capital goods is \nlimited.  In  Viet  Nam,  the  Government  acknowledges  the  importance  of  leasing  and  its \nsubstantive role as a financial intermediary for the SMEs, whose demand for replacement of \nobsolete equipment and machineries is high. Approximately 70% of leasing is currently serving \nthe SMEs and the proportion is expected to rise with the enactment of the Enterprise Law. The \nFSPL  II  addresses  two  critical  areas  constraining  growth  of  the  leasing  industry  by \n(i) establishing a regulatory environment conducive to business development and clear ground \nrules for contract enforcement, and (ii) organizing activities for public awareness and capacity \nbuilding. \n \na.  Establishing a Regulatory Environment Conducive to Business \nDevelopment  \n42.  Substantial regulatory and administrative gaps in the current system, hinder the use of \nleasing  as  an  alternative  financing  vehicle.  The  FSPL  II  focuses  on  filling  such  gaps  by \nestablishing a leasing regulations working group with government agencies concerned to deal \nwith matters such as the issuance of an import code for financial leasing companies, customs \nclearance procedures for importing leased assets, avoidance of dual registration fees where \nassets are transferred to the lessee at the end of the leasing period, and legal recognition of the \nacceptability of the notarized copy of the vehicle registration. \n \n43.  Detailed regulations are needed for registering security interests under lease contracts. \nThe FSPL II supports establishing a detailed procedure for registering security interest under \nleasing contracts in the secured transactions system. Furthermore to expand the scope of the \nleasing industry, the FSPL II supports issuance of a regulation to allow leasing companies to \nprovide operating leases in addition to finance leasing. The regulation is also expected to clarify \nthe treatment of depreciation and tax for the two types of leasing arrangements. \n \n44.  Among the legal and regulatory gaps, particularly troublesome is the lack of regulations \non procedures and methods for the lessor to claim leased assets if the lessee violates a lease \ncontract. While the lessor may declare default and bring the case to court, the legal procedure is \ncomplicated and time consuming. Decree 16 provides that if a lessee fails to make the lease \npayment, the lessor is entitled to claim the leased assets and the lessee is further obligated by \nlaw to compensate for material losses to the lessor. However, actual enforcement of the \nprocedure is difficult. Leasing companies are unable to quickly seize leased assets due to lack \nof procedural ground rules. To address this critical problem, SBV will cooperate with related \n ", "11 \nministries to issue a regulation on procedures and methods to deal with leased assets if a \nlessee violates the lease contract. \n \nb.  Organizing Activities for Public Awareness and Capacity Building \n45.  Although business is growing, leasing is still not well known in Viet Nam and many \npotential customers have yet to benefit from this alternative financing arrangement. There is \nconsiderable  need  to  educate  the  business  community,  particularly  SMEs,  about  leasing. \nDomestic leasing companies need substantial capacity building, particularly in risk assessment \nand management and due diligence of leasing contracts. No association represents the financial \nleasing industry, and establishment of such an association as a  self-regulatory organization \n(SRO) will be highly beneficial for both leasing companies and potential customers. The FSPL II \nsupports the Government to promote private sector initiatives for establishment of a leasing \nindustry association as an SRO that will engage in (i) public awareness activities, and (ii) an \nSME assistance center and training program. \n \n3.  Interbank and Money Markets Development \n46.  Interbank  and money markets are still at rudimentary stages of development. Few \ninstruments exist and the markets are small. Development of money markets will involve multi-\nfaceted  policy  efforts;  building  an  integrated  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  reorienting \nmonetary and foreign exchange policies, and establishing proper incentive structures for key \nmarket players. The FSPL II supports the Government's initiative to develop the interbank and \nmoney  market  and  focuses  on  (i)  deregulating  interest  rates  to  allow  for  money  market \ndevelopment, (ii) developing money market instruments, (iii) improving market microstructure, \nand (iv) enhancing SOCBs' treasury function and capacity. \n \na.  Deregulating Interest Rates \n47.  Control of interest rates affects the money market at  the most  fundamental level. In \nAugust 2000, a base rate system was introduced. This replaced a cap on dong lending rates \nwhich involved fixed bands on short- and medium-term loans. The band in effect predetermined \nthe maximum risk premium that may be charged. Interest rate control created market distortions \nand reduced incentives to participate in the money market. SBV's decision to do away with this \ncontrol was issued on 30 May 2002. The final step taken by the Government to deregulate \ninterest rates is expected to pave the way for an environment conducive to development of the \nmoney market.   \n \nb.  Developing Money Market Instruments \n48.  The types of instruments available on the money market must be expanded. To support \nmarket development, MOF began diversifying the maturities and increasing supply of treasury \nbills and Government bonds. The introduction of new products such as repurchase agreements  \nfor valuable papers and trade bills will further complement such initiatives. The restrictive and \nfragmented regulations on money market instruments and transactions inconvenience sellers \nand buyers and discourage innovations. As a result, use of existing instruments and creation of \nnew products remain limited on the money market. \n \n49.  To integrate the legal frameworks of different types of negotiable instruments, adoption \nof a negotiable instruments law will be essential. Currently, the Government is considering \nadoption of a comprehensive legal basis for a wide range of negotiable instruments, and the \n ", "12 \nFSPL II supports the effort along with other initiatives to increase the diversity of money market \ninstruments and its participants through (i) SBV's issuance of regulations to allow all banks to \nissue negotiable certificates of deposits, subject to appropriate prudential limits set by SBV; and \n(ii) issuance of regulations on interbank repurchase agreements of valuable papers in the \nmarket and a standardized repurchase agreements contract. On treasury bills, the FSPL II \nsupports (i) MOF's issuance of short-term treasury bills with maturities less than 1 year, and (ii) \nregularized issuance of treasury bills by publishing quarterly issuance schedules. The FSPL II \nwill introduce money market instruments with standardized features and limited risk profiles. \nDiversity in money market instruments, such as commercial papers,9 is expected with increased \ntransactions on the money market and growing familiarity with the use of money market \ninstruments. \n \nc.  Improving Market Microstructure \n50.  Thin  trading  has  meant  few  opportunities  for  developing  market  microstructure. \nCurrently, there are no intermediaries in the money market to facilitate transactions. Moreover, \nthe interbank market is fragmented, as the three distinct types of banks in Viet Nam (SOCBs, \nJSCBs, and foreign bank branches) generally engage in financial transactions within their own \ngroupings. Funds transfer between different groups of banks is limited despite opportunities for \nmutually  beneficial  transactions  arising  from  the  varied  funding  needs  of  their  divergent \ncustomers. The fragmentation is caused in part by the perception of higher credit risks. The \nFSPL II will facilitate the funds transfer through (i) regulation of money brokerage activities by \nSBV, and (ii) introduction of a money brokerage on a nondiscriminatory basis to integrate the \ninterbank market. \n \nd.  Enhancing SOCBs\u2019 Treasury Function and Capacity \n51.  Money market development has typically been led by commercial banks. However \nSOCBs\u2019 active participation in the money and foreign exchange markets is constrained by their \nweak commercial orientation, lack of profit motivation, inadequate treasury function, and limited \ncapacities for liquidity and risk management. For example, there is no standardized day-to-day \nreporting of liquidity positions from their branch offices and no established systems for risk \nmonitoring  and  management.  To  improve  banks'  treasury  systems  and  risk  management \ncapacities, the FSPL II supports SBV to adopt regulations that will require all SOCBs to (i) \nidentify and report their liquidity position on a daily basis, and (ii) limit the number of nostro \naccounts to a manageable level.10 Because nostro accounts are established to facilitate foreign \ncurrency transactions, the accounts are typically set up based on geography and relationships \nwith correspondent banks. The excessive number of nostro accounts should be reduced for \noperational efficiency and to prevent fraudulent activities.  \n \n4.  Fostering the Capital Market \n52.  Capital market operations have just begun in Viet Nam and there is still a long road \nahead to develop the market as an alternative channel of financial intermediation that is capable \nof  mobilizing  additional  domestic  resources  and  channeling  them  efficiently  to  viable \ninvestments in the country. Multipronged efforts are required to develop the nascent capital \n                                                 \n9  The legal basis for commercial paper was introduced in December 1999 under the Ordinance on Commercial Bills, \nas a means of providing short-term financing for enterprises. However its legal basis is restrictive and requires \nbank guarantees as well as linkages to specific business transactions.  \n10  Nostro accounts are accounts held with other domestic banks and foreign currency accounts with offshore parties. \n ", "13 \nmarket, including (i) broadening the base of the capital market, (ii) establishing a consolidated \nregulatory  framework  and  effective  surveillance  system,  (iii)  developing  capital  market \nintermediary  and  institutional  investors,  (iv)  initiating  SROs,  and  (v) enhancing  the  market \nmicrostructure.  \n \n53.  As a first step, the FSPL II supports SSC's adoption of a long-term capital market \ndevelopment plan. ADB has provided assistance for drafting a comprehensive plan for capital \nmarket development to strategically sequence reform measures, investment plans, and human \nresource  development.  The  plan  delineates  measures  for  increasing  the  supply  of  listed \ncompanies through (i) opening an SME trading board, (ii) allowing joint ventures to be listed, \nand (iii) adopting mandatory listing for large to medium-sized SOEs. The plan addresses issues \nin  the  legal  framework,  market  architecture,  clearance  and  settlement  systems,  prudential \nregulations,  and  governance  of  SSC,  all  requiring  concrete  steps  to  ensure  smooth \nimplementation. The plan will be the basis for the long-term capital market development plan to \nbe adopted by SSC (Supplementary Appendix B). \n \na.  Broadening the Capital Market Base \n54.  The FSPL II supports measures to link the SOE equitization program and STC listing \nthrough adoption of a list of SOEs who are potential candidates for listing. \u201cEquitization\u201d is a \nprocess of transforming Viet Nam\u2019s SOEs into entities with a corporate structure, including \nassets, liabilities, and equity. The equity may still be held by the Government and the SOE\u2019s \nemployees, but the companies will be operationally and financially separate from the primary \noperations of the Government. By identifying SOEs for potential listing from the early stage of \ntheir equitization program, the listing is expected to become a viable option in the process of \nequitization.  \n \n55.  The Government is also planning to establish a trading board for SMEs in Hanoi. Given \nthe dominance of SMEs in commerce and industries, there is a strong rationale for establishing \na securities market for SMEs in Viet Nam.11 This will also broaden the scope of the capital \nmarket. The FSPL II supports SSC to (i) approve a trading board for SMEs, and (ii) request and \nconsult MOF to issue an incentive system to induce listing of JSCs on STC or the trading board \nfor SMEs. According to SSC's survey, 350 of the 700 SOEs have issued shares and have \nexternal shareholders other than the Government, company employees, and management. Of \nthe 350, approximately 80 would qualify for listing on the STC. The rest could be listed on the \nSME trading board. \n \nb.  Establishing Consolidated Regulatory Framework and Market \nSurveillance System \n56.  The FSPL II focuses on the development of a market surveillance system to bolster \npublic confidence through adoption of a procedure for market surveillance and an inspection \nprocedure for securities companies. \n \n57.  Also,  to  assure  that  markets  are  fair,  efficient,  and  transparent,  opportunities  for \nsubstantial regulatory arbitrage between the listed and nonlisted equitized companies must be \n                                                 \n11  Over 300 SMEs are estimated to qualify for listing on the SME trading board. On the basis of a preliminary listing \ncriteria requiring (i) registered capital of more than D5 billion; (ii) positive earnings, solid financial position and \nearnings potential in the past fiscal period; (iii) minimum 10% of shares outstanding distributed to 50 outside \nshareholders; and (iv) audited financial statements for the last fiscal year with no or minimal qualification.  \n ", "14 \nresolved. The stringent listing standards and disclosure requirements set forth under Decree 48 \nand SSC's implementing regulations are in strong contrast with the relatively lax requirements \nunder the Enterprise Law binding the non-listed JSCs and discouraging JSCs from listing on \nSTC. This serious regulatory disadvantage serves as a disincentive for listing on STC and puts \ninvestment in the unregulated market of unlisted JSCs at risk. To establish a consolidated \nregulatory framework and close the regulatory gap, the Government will require JSCs that meet \nlisting requirements to disclose the same information as the listed companies to the National \nBusiness Information Center under the FSPL II. \n \nc.  Developing Institutional Investors \n58.  Currently, the investors on the STC are limited to individuals and a few corporations. \nThere are no securities investment funds in Viet Nam. Investment funds will offer small-scale \ninvestors (i) the opportunity to reduce risk of investment through portfolio diversification, and (ii) \nthe benefit of professional fund management. In turn, the investment funds will add depth to the \ncapital  market.  Equities  will  be  valued  on  the  basis  of  earnings  potentials.  Furthermore, \ninstitutional investors will command heightened governance standards on the listed companies. \nTo foster institutional investors in Viet Nam, the FSPL II focuses on developing securities \ninvestment funds through the amendment of Decree 48 to include a regulation for establishing \nsecurities investment funds, followed by licensing of securities investment funds by SSC.   \n \nd.  Developing Self-Regulatory Organization \n59.  Establishing an association of securities brokers and dealers to act as an SRO will do \nmuch to monitor and discipline brokerage activities. To foster the SROs from an early stage of \ncapital market development, the FSPL II supports the SSC in promoting and recognizing a \nsecurities brokers and dealers association (or securities industry association) as an SRO. The \ndistinct benefits to the capital market of self-regulation include access to market information and \nfirst-hand trading expertise of market participants. Such benefits may not be otherwise easily \navailable to regulators, and thus will be promoted under the FSPL II. \n \ne.  Enhancing Market Microstructure \n60.  SSC has exercised considerable prudence in the first year of its operation, tightly \ncontrolling market fluctuations and limiting the number of trading days per week. Such a \ncautious approach is understandable given the inexperience of SSC and STC staff. However, \ngreater market fluctuation is needed in a phased and orderly manner, while devising measures \nto restrict the impact of systemic risks. STC has expanded the trading days from 3 to 5 per week \nstarting 1 March 2002. Under the FSPL II, the trading band will be expanded from 2 to 5 \npercentage points and subsequently a circuit breaker system based on the market index \nintroduced. \n \n5.  Strengthen the Accounting and Auditing System \n61.  The  accounting  and  auditing  system  is  widely  recognized  as  the  key  financial \ninfrastructure, largely determining the degree of soundness and efficiency of a market-based \nfinancial system. The FSPL II supports the Government's efforts to develop the accounting and \nauditing system consistent with international best practices, placing particular emphasis on \nestablishing institutional mechanisms that ensure proper adoption and compliance. \n \n ", "15 \n62.  The SCPL supported the enactment of the new Accounting Law in 2002. The law will \nreplace the 1988 Ordinance on Accounting and Statistics, the major law on accounting in Viet \nNam at the present time. The current ordinance is inflexible and intended basically for statistical \nand tax purposes. The new law, with its content aligned to the best international practices, is \nbeing prepared for approval by the National Assembly. The Government gives high priority to \ndeveloping the Vietnamese Accounting and Auditing Standards and is committed to issue a full \nset of standards consistent with International Accounting and Auditing Standards by the end of \n2004.  The  World  Bank  is  providing  assistance  in  the  drafting  of  accounting  and  auditing \nstandards. The FSPL II will focus on building the institutional framework to raise awareness and \ncompliance. \n \na.  Establishing Accounting Enforcement Mechanisms \n63.  To strengthen the limited enforcement mechanism of accounting standards in Viet Nam, \nthe FSPL II will strengthen the Viet Nam Accounting Association (VAA) as a professional \norganization to act as an SRO. VAA was founded in 1994 and became a member of the \nInternational Federation of Accountants and the ASEAN Federation of Accountants in 1998. The \nassociation, however, lacks the financial means to be an effective institution and relies partly on \nfunding from MOF. Considerable support is required to build VAA\u2019s capacity to act as the \nassociation  for  building  and  ensuring  the  professional  competencies  of  accountants  and \nauditors of Viet Nam. Accordingly, the FSPL II will support (i) gradual phasing of power to VAA \nto act as an SRO, (ii) development of a plan to strengthen VAA to act as an SRO, (iii) revision of \nVAA's charter to assume responsibilities as an SRO, and (iv) transfer to VAA of several \nadministrative functions in accounting and auditing currently being undertaken by MOF. \n \n64.  Additionally, the FSPL II will support adoption of a code of ethics for the accounting and \nauditing profession, consistent with the best international practices and establishment of an \naccounting assistance center for SMEs, under the supervision of VAA. The newly enacted \nEnterprise Law12 requires the adoption of the Vietnamese Accounting System. Although the \nVietnamese Accounting System allows for a simplified version for SMEs, the newly registered \ncorporations are not likely to have fully adopted the accounting standards. In fact, in discussing \nlending to the SMEs, the banks have indicated lack of financial records and inadequate book \nkeeping as a primary constraint for lending, making assessment of their cash flow and financial \nviability impracticable. Under the FSPL II, a collaborative effort among the authorities, business \nassociations, and SMEs will be made to address this gap. \n \nb.  Developing Competitive Accounting Industry \n65.  Under the FSPL II, the Government will equitize state-owned auditing firms. Currently, \nMinistry of Planning and Investment (MPI) grants licenses or business registrations to auditing \ncompanies for operation and MOF certifies individual auditors. Viet Nam has 36 auditing firms \nconsisting of 6 state-owned audit firms, 25 private locally owned firms, 4 foreign-owned firms, \nand 1 joint venture. A serious conflict of interest exists for MOF to regulate and operate firms in \nthe accounting and auditing industry. This conflict of interest could greatly damage the public \nconfidence in the whole accounting and auditing industry. State ownership in auditing firms will \nbe reduced in a phased and orderly manner under the FSPL II. \n \n                                                 \n12  Under the new Enterprise Law, out of a total of 350 business licensing requirements,145 were eliminated and the \nuse of land-use rights as loan collateral was permitted, allowing start-up companies access to credit. Since the \nenactment of the Law, new registration of private SMEs has reached 40,000. \n ", "16 \n6.  Implement the Registry for Secured Transactions System \n66.  Under the FSPL I, the Government issued a Secured Transactions Decree, Decree 165, \nand a Decree Establishing the Registry for Secured Transactions. The Government continues to \nmake steady progress toward developing a nationwide computerized secured transactions \nregistration  system.  MOJ  has  prepared  an  implementation  plan  containing  milestones  for \nsystem development. In 2002, MOJ has established a registration center for asset transactions \nin  Hanoi  and  branch  no.  1  for  registration  of  assets  under  the  National  Department  for \nRegistration of Secured Transactions in Ho Chi Minh City. Still, to effectively secure credit, \nmuch work is needed both on the legal framework and system development.  \n \n67.  The current registration system will cover movable assets except aircraft, ships, land use \nrights, and fixtures built on land properties. The excluded objects are currently registered at their \nrelevant legislative agencies. However, the Government  plans to integrate  the registration \nsystem  including  the  currently  excluded  objects  in  the  future.  A  fully  centralized  and \ncomputerized national registration center is being prepared. The FSPL II supports the MOJ in (i) \ncarrying  out  necessary  activities  to  develop  a  centralized,  computerized,  and  networked \nregistration system for secured transactions system; (ii) continuing to implement the registry of \nsecured transactions in three other provinces and cities under central management on the basis \nof a centralized, computerized, and networked registration system and a national database \nsystem for secured transactions; and (iii) submitting a draft law or ordinance on registration of \nsecured transactions to the National Assembly. \n \n7.  Strengthening the Deposit Insurance System \n68.  Under the FSPL I, the Government issued a decree establishing the legal basis for a \nseparate and independent deposit insurance organization, Deposit Insurance of Viet Nam (DIV). \nDIV was established in June 2000 after considerable deliberations among the Vietnamese \npolicy makers and bankers. The mandate of DIV was set to (i) protect the legal rights and \ninterests of small depositors, (ii) contribute to maintaining the stability of credit institutions, and \n(iii) ensure safe and sound development of banking business. DIV was established within a \nframework for building an appropriate safety net, supported by SBV's prudential regulations and \nbank supervision.13  \n \n69.  The decree stipulates that dong deposits are insurable up to a maximum of D30 million \n($1,966) and all deposit taking credit institutions, including SOCBs, joint-stock commercial \nbanks, and people\u2019s credit funds, are covered under the system. Establishing DIV provides Viet \nNam with additional protection against bank runs and encourages small-scale depositors to \nsave through banks, thus mobilizing domestic financial savings. Much more, however, remains \nto be done. The Program Completion Report of the FSPL I identifies specific areas that need \nadditional assistance. \n \n70.  The current legal framework is deficient for sustaining DIV's integrity against potential \nmoral hazard problems arising particularly from extending financial support to ailing credit \ninstitutions. To preclude such moral hazards,  specific conditions under which DIV will give \nfinancial support should be clearly spelled out. The FSPL II supports the development of DIV by \n(i) adopting a regulation on DIV's joint on-site inspection with SBV, and (ii) specifying strict \nconditions under which DIV can provide financial support to problem banks.   \n                                                 \n13 Within this framework, SBV plans to strengthen the bank supervisory division's authority and organizational \nstructure and realign prudential regulations to BIS standards. \n ", "17 \n \n71.  Shortcomings in Decree 89, the legal framework for DIV, include the inability of DIV to (i) \nfinance from outside sources the pay-out to depositors in cases of large failures, and (ii) charge \ndifferent premiums in accordance with the different risk profiles of institutions being covered. To \naddress these issues, the FSPL II supports the Government's efforts in allowing DIV to (i) issue \nDIV bonds in accordance with the prevailing conditions on bond issuance, and borrow from the \ncommercial  banks  and  the  Government;  and  (ii)  charge  differential  premiums  among  the \ncovered credit institutions based on size, organizational structure, and institutional capacity of \nthe  distinct  categories  of  credit  institutions  being  covered  under  DIV,  and  their  inherently \ndissimilar  risk  profiles.  The  measure  is  deemed  to  be  particularly  meaningful  during  the \ntransitional phase of transferring the deposit insurance of people\u2019s credit funds to its own \nseparate system. \n \n72.  The FSPL II also supports the Government in considering the revision of the Decree on \nDeposit Insurance to gradually phase out the people\u2019s credit funds from the DIV coverage, once \nthe system safety fund is fully operational and can support problem people\u2019s credit funds. The \ntransition will improve the viability of the deposit insurance system and better meet its objective \nof protecting small depositors of the commercial banks and the payment system from systemic \nrisks. \n \n8.  Anti-Money-Laundering Measures  \n73.  SBV has sent representatives to observe meetings held by the Asia Pacific Group on \nMoney  Laundering.14  The  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  combating  money \nlaundering and there is a rising interest from different ministries, including MOJ and Ministry of \nPublic Security, in initiating the process of adopting anti-money-laundering measures in Viet \nNam. Money laundering is a major threat to the development of a sound financial system and \nthe well-being  of  the  global  society.  Under  the  1988  Vienna  Convention, all countries are \nrequired to set up comprehensive anti-money-laundering regimes. Of critical importance to the \nregime  are  measures  to  (i)  enhance awareness  of  money laundering activities  within  the \nGovernment and private businesses, (ii) establish the legal and regulatory basis for combating \nmoney laundering, and (iii) devise systems for reporting suspicious transactions. \n \n74.  The FSPL II will initiate the set up of such a regime in Viet Nam by issuing anti-money- \nlaundering regulations, creating a financial intelligence unit as provided for by the decree on \nanti-money-laundering regulation, and the Government joining the international organization on \nanti-money-laundering activity at least in observer member status. \n \nC.  Important Features \n75.  The FSPL II is expected to increase the efficiency of financial intermediation through \ndevelopment of alternative channels, thereby enhancing the potential of economic growth and \njob creation. Beneficiaries of such impact are expected to include the poor and the near poor. In \nthe medium-term, the FSPL II will also create a broader and more balanced financial system \nwith higher resilience to unfavorable exogenous shocks, which have serious implications for the \n                                                 \n14 The Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering was established in 1997 to facilitate the adoption, implementation, \nand  enforcement  of  internationally  accepted  anti-money  laundering  standards  as  set  out  in  the  40 \nrecommendations of the Financial Actions Task Force. Currently, it has 22 members and ADB is an observer \ninternational organization. \n ", "18 \npoor.  The  impact  of  the  FSPL  II  on  poverty  has  been  assessed  in  Appendix  4  and \nSupplementary Appendix A on Poverty Impact Assessment. \n \n76.  The  FSPL  II  is  classified  as  category  C  under  ADB\u2019s  environmental  classification \nsystem. The environmental implications were reviewed and no significant adverse impact was \nidentified. \n \n77.  The FSPL II is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement and impact on \nindigenous people under ADB's classification. No adverse impact on indigenous people, no \nadverse gender issues, nor triggering of involuntary resettlement is foreseen in implementing \nthe FSPL II. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n78.  The lending modality of the FSPL II will be a program cluster, comprising three back-to-\nback subprograms for a total of $75 million equivalent from the Asian Development Fund (ADF). \nThe FSPL II, subprogram I, will comprise an ADB loan of $50 million equivalent from the ADF. \nThe succeeding subprograms II and III will comprise loans of $10 million and $15 million \nequivalent from ADF, respectively. Upon completion of subprogram I, the Government and ADB \nwill explore the possibility of consolidating subprograms II and III.  \n   \n \n79.  Agence Francaise de Developpment (AFD) proposes to cofinance  \u20ac35 million ($34.5 \nmillion). AFD will disburse in tranches simultaneously with ADB disbursements, on the same \nschedule and conditions. The proceeds will be disbursed to a special account and will be used \nto finance costs of reforms in the financial sector, according to procedures to be defined \nbetween AFD and the Government. The details of the cofinancing arrangement will be finalized \nunder a separate loan agreement between the Government and AFD. \n \n80.  Upon  completion  of  subprogram  I,  additional  funding  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresource (OCR) will be considered should the Government require supplementary funding to \nfinance the adjustment cost incurred for undertaking the FSPL II.  \n \n81.  Each  subprogram  will  be  processed  sequentially  upon  completion  of  the  previous \nsubprogram. Subprogram I has two tranches and will be completed within 15 months of loan \neffectiveness. Subprogram II will be presented for Board consideration and approval based on \nthe progress achieved in implementing subprogram I, including the status of compliance with \nthe proposed policy actions, and the readiness of the Government to undertake the succeeding \npolicy reform measures. The implementation period for subprograms II and III will be within 39 \nmonths from subprogram I loan effectiveness. (Appendix 5 for implementation schedule.) \n \n82.  Where feasible, the Government is encouraged to undertake policy measures proposed \nunder  subprogram  II  during  the  implementation  of  subprogram  I.  ADB  will  reflect  the \nGovernment\u2019s achievements and refine policy actions under subprogram II accordingly, taking \ninto consideration the policy environment for implementing subprogram II. Subprogram III will be \nprocessed in a similar manner.  \n \n83.  For the loans under  the FSPL II, subprogram I, the ADF loan will have a repayment \nperiod of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and will carry an annual interest rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum during the amortization period.  \n \n ", "19 \n84.  The subprogram I loan will be utilized within 18 months from the date of subprogram I \neffectiveness. Ineligible items are listed in Appendix 6. \n \n85.  The total loan amount for the FSPL II and loan amounts for subprograms are determined \non the basis of the strategic importance of developing the financial sector and the costs of \nstructural reforms to be supported under the FSPL II. Such costs arising from reform measures \nto be implemented under the FSPL II are estimated to be around $200 million equivalent during \nthe 36 months planned for program implementation and will comprise: \n \n(i)  adopting  and  enforcing  higher  governance  standards,  including  disclosure  of \nfinancial information based on International Accounting and Auditing Standards \n($69 million); \n(ii)  establishing and ensuring sustainability of financial sector infrastructure and a \nsafety net, including registry for secured transactions and deposit insurance \nsystem ($43 million); \n(iii)  increasing fiscal cost for interest rate payments ranging from $54 million to $81 \nmillion for the 3 years of the FSPL II, should interest increase 1.0-1.5%; \n(iv)  building the institutional capacity of regulatory bodies, including modernizing of \nsurveillance systems to enable proper monitoring and enforcement of rules and \nregulations for the insurance sector and capital market ($29 million); and \n(v)  developing  physical  infrastructure  for  money  and  capital  market,  including \nupgrading SOCBs\u2019 treasury functions and money brokerage system, and opening \nSME sector trading center in Hanoi ($16 million). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangement \n1.  Program Management \n86.  SBV will be the Executing Agency for the FSPL II. SBV, MOF, MOJ, SSC, MPI, Steering \nCommittee for Enterprise Reform and Development (SCERD), and DIV will be the implementing \nagencies.  SBV  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  program  implementation,  including \nadministration and disbursement of loan proceeds, maintenance of accounts, and preparation of \nsemiannual progress reports on program implementation.  \n \n87.  To coordinate program implementation among Government ministries and agencies \nconcerned, a program steering committee (PSC) will be formed. The PSC will be chaired by a \ndeputy governor of SBV and will comprise senior officers, duly empowered to make decisions \non FSPL II implementation, from all ministries and government agencies concerned, including \nSBV, MOF, MPI, MOJ, SCERD, SSC, and DIV. The PSC will meet twice yearly and on an ad \nhoc basis to review pending issues and propose concrete action for their resolution to ensure \ntimely program implementation. A program implementation and coordination unit will be formed \nwithin SBV, headed by a senior officer of SBV, and staffed with SBV officials with sufficient \nknowledge and capacity to assist the PSC and ADB. The unit will be responsible for day-to-day \nimplementing of the FSPL II.  \n \n2.  Procurement and Disbursement \n88.  In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans,15 goods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will be \n                                                 \n15  ADB. 1998.

The proceeds of the FSPL II will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, subject to a \nnegative list of ineligible items (Appendix 6). Loan proceeds will be disbursed on the basis of a \ncertification provided by the Borrower, confirming that in each year in which the FSPL II \nproceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of total imports minus (i) imports from \nnonmember  countries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii)  imports  financed  under  other  official \ndevelopment assistance, is equal to or greater than the amount expected to be disbursed during \nthe year.  \n \n3.  Counterpart Funds \n90.  The FSPL II policy framework includes specific components that bear distinct structural \nadjustment costs. The counterpart funds to be generated from the loan proceeds will be used to \nfinance the structural adjustment costs under the FSPL II.   \n \n4.  Monitoring and Tranching \n91.  ADB, in cooperation with SBV, MOF, MPI, SSC, MOJ, SCERD, and DIV will conduct \nsemiannual reviews of the progress of the FSPL II implementation and assess the impact on the \nstructure and development of the financial sector. The Government and ADB will continue to \nengage in active policy dialogue on sector issues, policy reforms, and other measures during \nthe FSPL II period and on additional reforms that may be considered necessary or desirable. \n \n92.  The Government will provide ADB semiannual reports on the implementation of the \nFSPL II, particularly on the actions set out in the Development Policy Letter (Appendix 7), and \non the accomplishment of the FSPL II\u2019s objectives. The reports will be submitted in such form \nand detail and within the period as ADB may reasonably request, and will include (i) progress \nmade and specific problems encountered during the 6 months under review, (ii) steps taken or \nproposed to be taken to resolve the problems, and (iii) proposed FSPL II activities and expected \nprogress during the following 6 months. ADB will send regular review missions to confirm \ncompliance  with  conditions  for  the  second  tranche  release  of  subprogram  I  as  well  as \ncompliance with conditions for subprograms II and III, and advise on actions to maintain FSPL II \nimplementation  on  course.  The  Government  will  prepare  and  provide  ADB  a  program \ncompletion report on the overall impact of the policy reforms implemented within 3 months from \ncompletion of the FSPL II.  \n \na.  Subprogram I \n93.  The loan for subprogram I is to be released in two tranches: (i) equivalent of $20 million \n(from the ADF) upon compliance with the first tranche conditions, and (ii) $30 million equivalent \n(from the ADF) subject to fulfillment of second tranche release conditions. The timing for release \nof the first and second tranches is expected to be 6 and 15 months, respectively, from loan \neffectiveness but may be released earlier upon compliance to the specified tranche release \nconditions. ADB and the Government will review progress in implementing specified policy \nactions set out in the policy matrix approximately 3 months prior to the scheduled tranche \nrelease. First and second tranche release conditions are as set out in the policy matrix. \n ", "21 \nb.  Subprogram II \n94.  The proposed loan for subprogram II will be $10 million from ADF and its tranching \nremains  to  be  determined.  Policy  actions  for  subprogram  II  are  subject  to  revision  and \nrefinement following ADB\u2019s assessment of macroeconomic environment, lessons learned from \nimplementing subprogram I, and the overall progress of financial sector reforms. The conditions \nfor subprogram II are envisioned to be implemented within 12 months from loan effectiveness of \nsubprogram  II.  In  revising  and  refining  policy  actions  under  subprogram  II,  ADB  and  the \nGovernment will consider the possibility of consolidating subprograms II and III, in which case \nthe implementation period may be lengthened beyond 12 months. The proposed conditions for \nsubprogram II are as set out in the policy matrix. Among these conditions, the approval of a \ntrading board for SMEs in Hanoi by SSC will be included as a condition for Board consideration \nof subprogram II. \n \nc.  Subprogram III \n95.  The proposed loan for subprogram III will be $15 million from ADF and its tranching \nremains to be determined. Policy actions for subprogram III are also subject to revision and \nrefinement following ADB\u2019s assessment of macroeconomic environment, lessons learned from \nimplementing subprograms I and II, and the overall progress of financial sector reforms. The \nconditions for subprogram III are envisioned to be implemented within 12 months from loan \neffectiveness of subprogram III. The proposed conditions for the subprogram are as set out in \nthe policy matrix, and will be included as conditions for Board consideration of subprogram III. \nThese conditions include (i) establishment of supervisory body for the insurance sector under \nMOF, and (ii) submission of a negotiable instruments law to the National Assembly. \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n96.  Development of a sound and efficient financial and capital market will stimulate and \ncomplement the banking sector and promote financial intermediation, critical for sustaining Viet \nNam\u2019s economic growth. The capital market will supply investment capital and term funds on a \nmarket basis, largely lacking in the Vietnamese economy. Moreover, market discipline will \nstrengthen the financial and corporate sectors and induce efficiency in resource allocations. \nDevelopment of the insurance and leasing subsectors will provide alternative savings and \ninvestment vehicles and thus similarly diversify channels of financial intermediation. The FSPL II \nalso encompasses elements for easing private sector SMEs\u2019 access to formal financial products \nand services.  \n \n97.  In  addition  to  developing  alternative  means  of  financial  intermediation,  which  will \nbroaden and deepen the financial sector and improve mechanisms for better matching risks and \nterms of financial liabilities to assets, the FSPL II will specifically have positive impacts on \n \n(i)  SOCBs\u2019  operational  restructuring  by  reinforcing  their  commercial  orientation \nthrough improved liquidity management and participation in the money market,  \n(ii)  SOE restructuring by instituting a mechanism for privatization through initial \npublic offering, and \n(iii)  SMEs\u2019 access to term financing through leasing and the SME trading board. \n \n ", "22 \n98.  While, the FSPL II benefits will be felt by all sectors of the economy, its initial overall \nimpact will likely be small given the current size of the nonbanking subsector in Viet Nam. The \nFSPL  II  is  designed  to  facilitate  the  development  of  the  sector  and  improve  efficiency, \ngovernance, and prudence in its operations. Thus, benefits of the FSPL II, which include \nbroader access to financial services and a more competitive and diversified financial sector that \nreduces systemic vulnerabilities, are expected to become substantive with the concomitant \ngrowth of the money and capital market and insurance and leasing subsectors. \n \nB.  Risks \n99.  Three principal risks are associated with the FSPL II. The first is the resurfacing of \nsociopolitical pressure, which could delay the FSPL\u2019s reform process. Materialization of this risk \nis contingent on the economic performance of Viet Nam. Judging from the current  status of \nVietnamese economy and its outlook, and the proreform statements and achievements made by \nthe  present  Government  with  full  public  support,  this  risk  is  limited.  Nevertheless,  the \nmacroeconomic conditions and sociopolitical situation will be closely monitored against FSPL II \nobjectives and the proposed reform measures will be fine-tuned under the program cluster \nmodality to ensure successful implementation of the FSPL II.  \n \n100.  The second risk relates to the progress in banking and SOE restructuring, which weighs \nheavily on Viet Nam\u2019s financial sector. Numerous technical difficulties remain to be overcome \nand the slower-than-expected progress will have implications on achieving the objectives of the \nFSPL II. For example, the delay in SOE equitization may reduce the number of JSCs that can \nbe listed on STC. The financial instability originating from poorly sequenced bank restructuring \ncould put the emerging capital market and nonbank financial institutions at risk. However, the \ncomprehensive frameworks developed by IMF and the World Bank under PRGF and PRSC for \nbanking and SOE  restructuring and associated technical support from the bilateral agencies \nhave considerably mitigated these risks. Good coordination between ADB, IMF, and the World \nBank will continue to synchronize the subsectoral reform measures for achieving full benefits of \nFSPL II implementation. (Appendix 8 presents the development coordination matrix.) \n \n101.  The third risk pertains to the technical capacities of implementing agencies, which \ninclude MOF, MOJ, and SBV. The Government\u2019s track record suggests that given adequate \ntechnical support, its commitment to the proposed reforms is strong. In implementing the FSPL \nI, for example, delays were predominantly caused by the lack of technical expertise in the \nfinancial sector. To reduce this risk in the FSPL II, comprehensive discussions were undertaken \nwith the implementing agencies and the technical assistance for capacity building for non-bank \nfinancial institutions and capital market16 will tackle the anticipated technical difficulties with \nimplementing the policy actions proposed under the FSPL II.   \n \n102.  The TA will be designed to support implementation of policy actions under the FSPL II. \nSpecific weaknesses of implementing agencies have been identified as those pertaining to \ndrafting laws, rules, and regulations in the financial sector, taking into consideration experience \nof other countries and the best international practices.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \nSector identified as a national      Yes  Sector identified as a national    Yes   \npriority in country poverty analysis?  priority in country poverty  \n  partnership agreement? \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nThe financial sector's contribution to poverty reduction in Viet Nam on both macro and individual \nlevels. \n \nOn the macro level, the financial sector mobilizes savings and channels financial resources for \nproductive purposes, and is fundamental for sustainable economic growth and stability.  To \nrealize the Government's target to reduce poverty level by 12 percentage points from 2001 to \n2010, Viet Nam needs to grow at more than 7% per year. A sound financial sector is required for \nsuch growth. \n \nFirst, the financial sector supports economic growth through mobilizing resources (savings and \nother means of investments domestically and internationally). In Viet Nam, in addition to existing \nbanks, other financial intermediaries such as insurance and leasing as well as capital market are \nstill in the primary stage. Under the Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL) II, the development \nof these subsectors will help to mobilize domestic resources, long-term funding in particular. The \nGovernment estimates  that  for  2001-2005, about $60 billion will  need to  be mobilized for \ndevelopment investment. This target can only be achieved by a well-functioning and diversified \nfinancial sector.  \n \nSecond, the financial sector also functions as a  channel for allocating resources to the real \nsector. Currently, many segments of the economy including the private sector and  especially \nsmall- and medium-enterprises (SMEs) have difficulties accessing credit and other financial \nservices. This is because of high costs, lack of regional outreach, and limited understanding of \nalternative sources of funding. Under the FSPL II, these constraints will be addressed (details \nsee Section B, and Supplementary Appendix A). Moreover, the development of the real sectors, \nincluding  the  private  sector  and  especially  SMEs,  benefits  from  easily  available  financial \nproducts. Development of the real sector  facilitates adjustment,  and thereby offers greater \neconomic opportunities to the poor and vulnerable.  \n \nFor the individual livelihood, a sound and efficient financial system provides accessible, and \nwell-diversified financial services. In cases of economic or other crisis, a sound financial system \ncan offer an opportunity for reducing income fluctuation, and thus people\u2019s vulnerability.  \n \nThe Government has long  recognized that a sound financial sector is essential for poverty \nreduction, and has listed it as a priority of reform in its Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and \nGrowth Strategy. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  47 \n \n  B.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Classification: Beneficiary non-specific \n \nAnalysis: \n \nThe FSPL II has five components, all with implications for poverty reduction (Supplementary \nAppendix A). The implementation of the FSPL II will lead to a more balanced and competitive \nfinancial structure,  increase income and employment generating activities,  reduce income \nfluctuation of individuals and businesses, and thereby contribute to macroeconomic stability and \npoverty reduction. \n \n1.   Insurance Sector  \n \nThe  FSPL  II  targets  (i)  creating  a  competitive  business  environment,  (ii)  enhancing \ncorporate governance of insurance companies, (iii) strengthening supervision and prudential \nregulation, and (iv) developing insurance infrastructure. Through these policy measures, the \nFSPL II will directly support the development of insurance market by enlarging supply \ncapacity of the insurance business and promoting public confidence in the sector. \n \nThe implementation of the FSPL II will contribute to reducing insurance  premiums and \ndiversifying insurance products, and thereby reduce the vulnerability of the poor and SMEs \nin  case  of  catastrophic  events.  Lower  insurance  premiums  will  reduce  expenses  of \nindividuals as well as the operating costs of the private sector, including SMEs. The new \ninsurance  products  will  enable  SMEs  to  enlarge  domestic  and  international  business \nopportunities (e.g., export/import insurance, cargo insurance) which will contribute to SME \ndevelopment.  The  private  sector,  especially  SME  development,  will  generate  more \nemployment and income. \n \nFurthermore,  domestic  funds  mobilized  by  the  insurance  sector  will  provide  long-term \nfinancial resources essential for growth of the economy in general and the private sector in \nparticular. \n \n2.  Leasing Sector \n \nThe FSPL II addresses two  major constraints in leasing sector development, regulatory \nenvironment and contract enforcement, as well as public awareness and capacity building \nactivities.  \n \nThe implementation of the FSPL II will lead to provision of more diversified leasing products \nand lower leasing spreads. The availability of leasing products  (operational leasing) and \ndiversified  services  will  give  SMEs  access  to  funding  for  capital  equipment,  improve \nproductivity, and allow producers of capital equipment to reduce their marginal cost of \nproduction through increased volume, leading to reduced prices. Lower leasing spreads will \nreduce the expenses of individuals as well as the operating cost of the private sector, \nincluding SMEs. This will enable SMEs to  expand domestic and international business \nopportunities, which will contribute to SME development, leading to higher employment and \nincome generation. \n \n3.  Money and Interbank Markets \n \nThe FSPL II promotes the development of  the money and interbank markets through  (i) \nincreasing flexibility of interest rates to allow for money market development, (ii) developing \nmoney market instruments, (iii) improving market microstructure, and (iv) enhancing state-\nowned commercial banks' treasury function and capacity.  \n \n \n ", "48   Appendix 4 \n \nThe  implementation  of  the  FSPL  II  will  lead  to  reduced  operating  costs  of  financial \ninstitutions due to the development of interbank and money markets. This will help reduce \nthe interest rate spread, and in turn cut down funding cost of the private sector, especially \nSMEs. Reduced financial intermediation cost and the real sector\u2019s funding cost will help to \nexpand the outreach of financial products and services as well as stabilize the general price \nlevel. \n \nDevelopment  of  private  sector,  especially  SMEs,  will  generate  more  employment \nopportunities. In addition, with lower costs of financial services and general price level, the \npoor\u2019s access to credit and asset accumulation will be improved.  \n \n4.  Capital Markets \n \nThe FSPL II supports multipronged efforts for capital market development including (i) \nbroadening the base of capital market, (ii) establishing a consolidated regulatory framework \nand effective surveillance system, (iii) developing institutional investors, (iv) initiating self \nregulatory organizations, and (v) enhancing market microstructure. \n \nThe development of capital market will also reduce operating cost of financial institutions, \nwhich will help tighten the interest rate spread. As a result, the funding cost of the private \nsector, especially SMEs, will be cut. Moreover, the reduced financial intermediation cost and \nthe real sector\u2019s funding cost will help to  expand the outreach of financial products and \nservices as well as stabilize general price levels. \n \nThe reduced funding costs will generate more employment opportunities. This, combined \nwith more diversified investment opportunities will improve the poor\u2019s access to credit and \nasset accumulation. \n \n5.   Financial Infrastructure \n \nThe FSPL II focuses on strengthening accounting standards, the accounting industry and \nenforcement mechanism, the secured transactions system, the deposit insurance system, \nand anti-money-laundering activities.  \n \nThe  development of financial infrastructure will reduce uncertainties related to financial \ninstitutions as well as system as a whole. The  establishment of common accounting and \naudit standards and their enforcement system and secured transactions system will reduce \nuncertainties in lending and thus risk premiums, which will in turn reduce the cost of financial \nservices and the funding costs of the real sectors. Reduced funding cost and increased fund \navailability will promote development, increase employment, stabilize price levels, and thus \ncontribute to sustainable macroeconomic growth. \n \nEstablishment of financial infrastructure will promote confidence in the financial system, and \nin turn promote resource mobilization critical for economic growth. Economic growth will \nincrease potential employment from the private sector, especially SMEs. The poor will \nbenefit from the  improved access to financial services as well as increased employment \nopportunities. Furthermore, increased savings and compensation on savings will promote \ngrowth of family assets. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  49 \n \n  C.
