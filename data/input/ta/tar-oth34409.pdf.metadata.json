INTRODUCTION\n1. The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  2000-2002  country  assistance  plans  (CAPs)  for\nCambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR), and Viet Nam emphasize the importance of\nsustainable economic growth for poverty reduction. To achieve this growth, support for private sector\ndevelopment  is  identified  as  one  priority  development  area  for  each  of  those  countries.  The\ndevelopment of private, small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in particular is seen as crucial to\nreducing poverty. As part of this effort, financial intermediation, a component of developing well-\nfunctioning financial systems to promote private sector development, is one of four priority areas of\noperation under ADB\u2019s new Private Sector Development Strategy.1\n2. At the user end of financial intermediation, the strategy recognizes the importance of SME\ndevelopment as a major generator of employment and income. Given the small size of transactions\nand the risks involved, direct assistance from ADB is difficult and time consuming. To assist this\nmarket, therefore, the strategy calls for working through SME investment funds and specialized\nfinancial institutions, and cooperating with existing regional organizations to stimulate private sector\ninvestment. SMEs require capital, and advice and training in various aspects of their operations,\ne.g., including business planning, marketing, accounting and finance, management capacity, access\nto business support services, and environmentally clean production. Provision of this technical and\nbusiness advisory assistance is to be done primarily in collaboration with organizations that are in a\nposition  to  provide  such  support.  In  this  regard,  ADB  has  been  holding  discussions  with  the\nInternational  Finance  Corporation  (IFC)  concerning  its  Mekong  Project  Development  Facility\n(MPDF), which has SME development operations in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. The aim of\nthe discussions was to develop a means of ADB support for MPDF to extend its activities in line with\nADB\u2019s objectives of sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. This dialogue involved an\nADB mission attending the MPDF annual donors meeting in Phnom Penh on 13-15 January 2000.\nThe outcome is this regional technical assistance (TA).2 The TA framework is in Appendix 1.3\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. With  the  objective  of  developing  effective  enabling  environments  for  private  sector\noperations, over the last few years ADB has provided loan and TA support, through its public sector\noperations, to the financial market and industry sectors of developing member countries (DMCs) in\nthe Mekong Region. This intervention is continuing under the current CAP for each country and is\ndirected to needed reforms in the financial, capital markets, and industry sectors, as well as capacity\nbuilding for public sector institutions that impact on the private sector. This effort has been carried\nout in cooperation with the World Bank and other aid organizations. Such reforms are expected to\nlead to a regulatory and policy environment that will attract more private sector investment, both\nforeign and local, in this region. Despite some progress in this regard, the pace of reform has been\nslow and more remains to be done. All three countries are transitional economies with difficult\noperating environments for the private sector. This is especially true in the largest of them, Viet Nam,\nwhere  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework  continues  to  heavily  favor  state-owned  enterprises\n(SOEs), and few effective mechanisms are in place to support domestic private enterprise. For\nexample, local banks prefer to lend to SOEs creating a capital shortage for SMEs; capped interest\nrates prevent pricing for risk; collateral requirements are closely associated with land use rights; an\n                                                \n1 Private Sector Strategic Developments and Review. 31 July 2000. Manila.\n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in June 2000.\n3 The SME Department of IFC is currently developing a detailed measurement framework for SME development\nimpact. It is expected to be completed prior to year-end 2000. This framework will be made available to ADB and\nwill serve as further basis for impact measurement coordination and discussion between IFC, MPDF, and ADB.", "2\ninsufficient legal framework4 disqualifies most private firms from accessing bank financing; banks\nlack  project  appraisal  skills  and  thus  shy  away  from  SMEs;  SOEs  corner  local  markets;  new\ntechnology and skilled management are lacking; and foreign investors are steered by government\nauthorities toward SOEs.\n4. The three governments now recognize that SME development offers the greatest potential\nfor increasing GDP growth through productive job creation, growth in worker income, and increased\nefficiency in all sectors of the economy. The private sector domestic SME is still at a low stage of\ndevelopment partly because governments favor the state-owned and foreign invested sectors. It is\nencouraging that government attitudes to the private sector and SMEs in particular, and what this\nsector has to offer to economic growth, are becoming more positive. This is manifested by the desire\nof governments to actively encourage this development. This attitude must now be supported with\npractical assistance to SMEs in accessing capital; management and staff training; capacity building;\nbusiness development services; and market knowledge. MPDF\u2019s operational experience over the\nlast two years and the SME business surveys in each of the three countries give evidence that the\ndemand for credit and business support and advisory services is increasing rapidly. This demand\ncan only be met and sustained, over the long term, by local financial institutions and local service\nproviders. It is these institutions that have to be given the capability to service the SME market.\n5. ADB has made only one direct private sector investment in the three DMCs; that was for a\nmajor industrial project in Viet Nam. In the SME sector, the only investment was in a fund in\nThailand. The specific development needs of private SMEs in the three DMCs have been difficult to\naddress  through  ADB\u2019s  public  sector  interventions  and  the  constraints  of  its  private  sector\noperations. ADB sees a possible way to expand its role in SME private sector development activities\nby effectively blending and complementing its extensive involvement in public sector reforms with\ndirect, relevant, and specific applications and assistance to this market segment. Taking into account\nthe small investment sizes and cost of delivering services to SMEs, ADB will begin to focus and\ndeliver these interventions through other regional institutions, created to address and be proactive in\nthe SME market. The first application of this approach, through regional TA, was with the South\nPacific  Project  Facility  (SPPF),  which  has  met  notable  success  in  promoting  private  sector\ninvestments in the Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs).5 Thus, the TA will seek to\nstimulate private sector SME investment and development in the Mekong Region using the existing\nnetwork, and organizational and managerial capabilities of MPDF.\n6. MPDF was established in 1996 by IFC and commenced operation in 1997. It is funded by\nAustralia,  European  Union,  Finland,  IFC,  Japan,  Norway,  Sweden,  Switzerland,  and  United\nKingdom. The MPDF mission is to assist and accelerate the development of productive, self-\nsustaining, small and medium-size private sector entrepreneurs in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet\nNam. It is charged with improving the enabling environment for SME development. MPDF defines an\nSME as an enterprise with turnover of less than $15 million per annum. MPDF\u2019s target market is an\nSME that employs a minimum of 10 staff and has a project financing requirement between $150,000\nand $10 million. Firms must be either 100 percent locally owned or joint ventures with significant\nlocal ownership, have a sound business concept that is financially and economically viable, and be\nin the productive sectors (no tobacco or military products involved). All projects must undergo both a\nsocial and environmental impact review to ensure compliance with policies of the local and national\ngovernment, and IFC/MPDF. MPDF has a full-time adviser for social and environmental issues who\nreviews all projects to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and monitors projects to report\non and seek remedies for violations. The introduction of international labor standards is a medium-\n                                                \n4  Under TA 2823\u2013VIE: Registration System for Secured Transactions, for $500,000, approved on 14 July 1997, ADB\nis helping improve the legal framework.\n5 TA 5683\u2013REG:  South Pacific Project Facility, for $300,000, approved on 26 April 1996; and TA 5891\u2013REG: South\nPacific Project Facility II: Private Sector Development Support, for $300,000, approved on 23 December 1999.", "3\nterm goal for MPDF operations. For cost and efficiency in service delivery, MPDF has not targeted\nmicro and/or household enterprises, although it recognizes their importance in these economies. It\nsupports and cooperates in various ways with nongovernment organizations (NGOs) active in the\nsmaller end of the market. MPDF also provides training, particularly in credit assessment, and\ninstitutional strengthening to local financial institutions. The effectiveness and capability of local\nbanks are critical to SME development. MPDF is the largest SME facility in the Mekong Region.\n7. The principal activities of MPDF cover two areas. The first area is investment evaluation and\npreparation (part A). Here, MPDF assists SMEs in (i) preparing feasibility and market studies;\n(ii) evaluating the clients\u2019 current operational and financial status; (iii) evaluating and advising on\ncorporate and management structures, financial and management reporting systems, legal and\npersonnel issues, training requirements, and market and operational strategies; (iv) advising on\ntechnology needs and possible sources; (v) preparing overall business and financing plans; (vi)\narranging  and  negotiating  debt  and  equity  financing  through  domestic  and  foreign  financial\ninstitutions; and (vii) in collaboration with domestic and international aid agencies, arranging required\nspecialist expertise to assist the client in implementing the SME\u2019s business plan. The second area of\noperation is the MPDF in-country capacity development program (part B). This service aims to\nencourage the development and expansion of a sustainable in-country capacity to deliver the type of\nservices  in  part  A.  Both  programs  work  together  toward  the  objective  of  sustainable  SME\ndevelopment.  In  doing  this,  the  facility  actively  supports,  complements,  and  collaborates  with\nmultilateral and aid-assisted agencies and in-country private programs working in the SME sector in\nthe Mekong Region.6\n8. MPDF has two boards: one comprising representatives from its donor agencies and IFC, and\na nine-member advisory board comprising individuals with extensive experience in business and\neconomic development in the Mekong Region. Both boards play an active role in MPDF\u2019s operations\nproviding welcome ideas and suggestions, and criticisms of MPDF\u2019s programs. With this TA, ADB\nwill acquire a seat on the MPDF Donor Board. IFC provides technical and management support to\nMPDF. MPDF headquarters is in Hanoi. The staff comprise a facility manager, six senior officers,\nand eight professional and seven administrative staff. Field offices are located in Ho Chi Minh City\n(15 staff), Vientiane (5 staff), and Phnom Penh (5 staff). Consultants are employed to undertake\nspecific  project  assignments.  MPDF  charges  a  nominal  amount  for  most  of  its  services,  with\ncontributions by donors meeting virtually the full cost of MPDF operations. The first three years of\noperation to 31 December 1999 were funded by a budget contributed by IFC and donors. Donor\ncontributions are made yearly or for a five-year period (Appendix 2). Current commitments will be\nsufficient to fund MPDF operations into 2001. The TA will fund a two-year slice of the 2001-2002\nprogram (Appendix 3).\n9. MPDF has developed close working relationships, not only with its specific clients but also\nwith each of the governments of the region and their agencies, local bankers, business associations,\nNGOs, and other social and environmental groups working in the SME sector. As of 31 December\n1999, MPDF has successfully secured financing for 38 projects. Since the start of operations, its\nprojects have directly created 17,000 jobs, redistributing job opportunities to poor and remote areas\nand generating and/or saving over $25 million in foreign exchange yearly. Approximately $30 million\nequivalent in financing was arranged for these projects. The projects cover a broad range of sectors\nand are planned to achieve the greatest development impact. Sixteen percent of the completed\nprojects are owned by women. Many more are couple-owned, where women have decision making\npower. In 26 percent of the projects, over 70 percent of the workforce are women. In addition, MPDF\nprojects are designed for maximum demonstration impact. If factors, such as success in introducing\n                                                \n6 Supplementary Appendixes provide further details on MPDF's operations and are available at the Financial Sector\nand Industry Division West (IWFI).", "4\nbest practices in project preparation, business and financial planning and management, introducing\nclean technology and socially responsible working conditions, good governance principles, quality\nstandards and assurance, etc. are included, the real benefit of MPDF interventions exceeds the\nmeasurable indicators such as employment generation or foreign exchange earned or saved. While\nthe majority of the completed projects were in Viet Nam, MPDF\u2019s three-year forecast includes an\nincrease in its program activities in Cambodia, with continued effort to achieve more progress in the\nLao PDR. Each of the three countries poses a special challenge for MPDF in its SME development\nrole. To its credit, MPDF takes a realistic view of the potential for success of its programs in each\ncountry and while it may allocate more of its resources to where it feels they will produce the best\noverall results, it realizes that its objectives in each country are the same and that developing the\nSME  market  is  a  long-term  process.  MPDF  has  established  itself  as  a  reputable  regional\norganization,  enjoying  good,  broad  support  from  the  Mekong  Region  DMCs.  An  independent\nevaluation  of  its  operations  in  December  1999  concluded  that,  overall,  MPDF  has  been  very\nsuccessful in achieving its objectives.\n10. Given the success of MPDF operations to date and the comparative advantage it enjoys in\nthe SME sector in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam, ADB TA to assist in financing MPDF\u2019s\nconsulting and project activity programs will be an effective way for ADB to enter this market and\nparticipate in stimulating private sector SME development within the three DMCs it serves. Using TA\nfunds, ADB can capitalize on MPDF\u2019s established and demonstrated capabilities in developing\nviable, SME private sector projects and delivering needed and effective financial and business\nsupport services to SMEs in the region. Working with MPDF will provide ADB valuable insights into\nthe operational status of the SME and local financial markets in the three countries and the practical\nrequirements for establishing effective enabling environments for their growth and development. This\nwill assist ADB in its policy dialogue with the three governments and enhance the effectiveness of its\npublic sector reform program interventions to address those requirements. ADB reform programs will\nlikewise assist MPDF to better achieve its direct SME development objectives. An example is ADB\u2019s\nwork and experience in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) development program, which is seen\nas  important  by  MPDF  in  opening  opportunities  for  SME  cross-border  trade,  investment,  and\ntechnology transfer, and will therefore bring additional, cooperative value to both organizations\u2019\ndevelopment  efforts.  This  TA,  on  a  stand-alone  basis,  represents  an  effective  public-private\npartnership for SME development as well as an effective modality for ADB involvement in the SME\nsector. The TA helps to ensure the long-term continuity of MPDF programs and places ADB and\nother donors supporting MPDF into a close operational relationship, speaking with one voice to\naddress the practical and development needs of SMEs. ADB is also considering an investment in a\nproposed Mekong Enterprise Fund in which some of MPDF\u2019s other donors and IFC are likely\ninvestors. MPDF will be directly involved in the fund\u2019s operations. This would represent another\nimportant collaboration and synergy link between ADB, MPDF, and the latter\u2019s other donors in\npromoting an enabling environment for SME development in the Mekong Region.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n11. In pursuance of ADB\u2019s overarching objective of reducing poverty in the DMCs of the Mekong\nRegion  through  sustainable  economic  development,  the  TA,  using  the  existing  network  and\norganizational and managerial capabilities of MPDF, will stimulate productive private sector SME\ninvestment and business activities, environmental management, clean production technologies, and\npollution control, by increasing and enhancing the provision of credit and business, financial, and\ntechnical advice and services to SME entrepreneurs, businesses, and local financial institutions.", "5\nB.   Scope\n12. The TA will help meet the cost of consultants recruited by MPDF in undertaking its project-\nrelated activities and the related cost of project support programs for private sector SME and local\nfinancial institutions in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam. In accordance with MPDF operational\nexperience and projected program need, the consultant requirement is expected to be primarily for\n2-6 months assignments in the field. One possible project being considered for TA financing is the\nestablishment and operation of a Bank Training Center, which could cost approximately $350,000. It\nis therefore difficult to fix the exact number of assignments the TA will fund, but an approximation is\n10-12 assignments totaling approximately 42 person-months. In addition, the TA is expected to fund\nportions of program activities related to consultant project assignments. MPDF services financed by\nthe TA will be limited to Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam.\nC.   Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The TA is expected to be used over 24 months, ending on 31 December 2002. Over this\nperiod, MPDF total consulting expenditures are projected at approximately $2.5 million equivalent, of\nwhich $725,000 will be financed by the TA. MPDF total expenditure on related workshops, training,\nand support services is projected at $140,000 equivalent, of which $25,000 will be financed by the\nTA  (Appendix  4).  The  TA  will  fund  fees,  airfares,  and  daily  subsistence  payments  relating  to\nconsulting assignments. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA\nprogram.\nD.   Implementation Arrangements\n14. The MPDF will be the Executing Agency for the TA. MPDF will undertake all matters relating\nto the design of specific assignments, preparation of terms of reference, selection and recruitment of\nconsultants, and administration of each assignment. With a seat on the MPDF Donor Board, ADB\nwill help formulate MPDF\u2019s overall program activities to ensure close collaboration between these\nactivities and ADB\u2019s own reform programs and those of other MPDF donors, to promote effective\nenabling environments for private sector SME development. This will be formally accomplished on\nan annual basis when MPDF presents its proposed yearly programs to donors for their consideration\nand approval. ADB will monitor the MPDF programs, including those funded by the TA, on a\nsemiannual basis at donor meetings and through quarterly and semiannual reports submitted by\nMPDF on the status of its projects. MPDF has committed to have its offices in each of the three\ncountries meet continually with ADB resident missions to discuss TA-funded projects and the SME\ndevelopment programs of both institutions. This will ensure close coordination and information\nsharing, allowing relevant input for dialogue on needed reforms, with the concerned governments.\nTA-funded projects will address specific development and/or reform initiatives and will have a\ndemonstrative, positive development impact, contributing to the overall reform and/or regulatory\nrequirements to promote private sector SME development. Given the nature of some projects and\ntheir size, as well as MPDF submission of quarterly and semiannual project status reports, specific\nTA completion reports are usually not prepared on MPDF projects. However, ADB will retain the\nright to request TA completion reports.\n15. MPDF follows IFC consultant selection procedures and consultant contracts are in the name\nof IFC. Accordingly, IFC consultant selection procedures consistent with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants will be used in selecting consultants financed under the TA. In addition, IFC\nguidelines for payment of consultant fees and allowances will apply. However, specific procedures\nwill be adopted to ensure that TA funds are applied only to meet costs relating to consultants\nrecruited from ADB member countries. IFC and ADB will formally agree on the procedures.", "6\n16. Only consulting assignments relating to projects in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam will\nbe eligible for ADB financing. Eligibility criteria for the use of the funds will require that potential\nviable and suitable projects developed using TA funds be referred to the ADB Private Sector Group\nfor possible financing. MPDF will seek reimbursement for consulting services from ADB on the basis\nof claims to be submitted quarterly for eligible expenditures under the TA. ADB will, however, retain\nthe right of prior approval of TA funding, through the Financial Sector and Industry Division West for\ntwo reasons: first, as necessary, to ensure adequate coordination of ADB and MPDF programs and\ninputs; and second, to be aware of any assignment that is expected to cost more than $200,000\nequivalent (Appendix 5).\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n17. The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$750,000 for the purpose of Small and Medium-Size Enterprise Growth and Development in the\nMekong Region, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "7\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Targets/Measurable Project Monitoring Risks/Assumptions\nSummary Indicators\nGoal\n\u2022  Stimulate \u2022  Increased small and \u2022  Statistical data on \u2022  Continuing reform in\nproductive private medium-size private sector Mekong Region DMCs\nsector investment enterprise (SME) investment and aimed at creation of\nand business private sector business activities conducive environment\ndevelopment in investments in and local bank for private sector\nMekong Region absolute amounts financing to SMEs development including\ndeveloping and as a share of including data on the creation of an\nmember countries gross domestic private sector effective banking\n(DMCs). product (GDP). investments, business system and open\nformation, investment regimes\n\u2022  Increase capacity \u2022  Increased foreign employment\nof local financial direct investments generation, training, \u2022  Conducive macro\ninstitutions to foreign investment, environment\nprovide \u2022  Increased business and demonstrated\ncredit/banking formation and development impact\nservices to SMEs provision of business and reform/regulatory\n(specifically in product services measures in place to\nViet Nam and improve enabling\nCambodia) \u2022  Increased credit environment for SME\navailability to SMEs development\n\u2022  Improve from local financial\nregulatory, legal, institutions\nadministrative, and\ngovernance\nframework for\ndevelopment of\nenabling\nenvironment for\nSME development\nObjective and\nPurpose\n\u2022  Enhance provision \u2022  Improved availability \u2022  Feedback from SME \u2022  Favorable private\nof credit and and diversity of clients, local financial sector investment\nbusiness and business and institutions, investors, environment and\ntechnical technical advice and nongovernment effective/efficient\nassistance to SME credit availability to organizations banking systems\nmarket SMEs to achieve (NGOs), service\npositive development providers,\nimpact in the Mekong government agencies\nRegion and aid organizations\nOutputs\n\u2022  Feasibility and \u2022  Measurable forecasts \u2022  Annual, semiannual, \u2022  Active local business\nmarket studies of the following and quarterly reports;
