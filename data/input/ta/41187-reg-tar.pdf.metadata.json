The Pacific region is prone to natural disasters, experiencing droughts, earthquakes, floods, \ncyclones,  landslides,  sea  surges,  tsunamis,  and  volcanic  eruptions.  Each  Pacific  developing \nmember country (PDMC)1 faces a different set of risks and potential losses with respect to natural \ndisasters. An increased awareness of climate change issues in the Pacific region has contributed to \nthe view that the frequency and intensity of natural disasters may be increasing. This perception \nhas been reinforced by the occurrence of recent major natural disasters such as the 26 December \n2004 Asian tsunami, and the April 2007 Solomon Islands\u2019 earthquake and tsunami.  \n \n2.  The  Pacific  Regional  Framework  for  Action  for  Building  the  Resilience  of  Nations  and \nCommunities to Disasters 2005\u20132015 was approved by the Leaders of Pacific Islands Forum \ncountries  in  2005.2  It  calls  for  \u201cconsideration  of  financial  risk  sharing  schemes,  particularly \ninsurance and reinsurance and other financial modalities for risk transfer\u201d, and its implementation is \npromoted through the Pacific Plan.3  \n \n3.  In preparing the technical assistance (TA),4 an ADB mission participated in the October \n2007 World Bank Small Islands States Forum where the role of catastrophe insurance schemes in \nbuilding developing country resilience to natural catastrophes was discussed. The TA is designed to \ncontribute to work being pursued by several development partners (including ADB) and led by \nWorld Bank to assess the feasibility of a catastrophe insurance scheme for the Pacific. There have \nbeen consultations between ADB and World Bank to discuss the scope of the work under the TA. \nAdditional  discussions  have  been  held  with  insurance  industry  representatives  and  with \ndevelopment partners regarding a stronger approach to managing natural catastrophes in the \nPacific region.  \n \n4.  ADB and PDMCs have agreed on the intended impact, outcome, and outputs; and on the \nimplementation and financial arrangements, cost, and terms of reference of the TA. The impact, \noutcome, and outputs are summarized in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). Cost \nand financing arrangements are summarized in the cost estimates and financing plan (Appendix 2). \nThe outline terms of reference form Appendix 3. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  PDMCs regularly suffer the impacts of earthquakes and tsunamis, and other natural hazards \nthat are exacerbated by human-induced climate change, including cyclones, droughts and floods. \nNatural  catastrophes  can  have  an  enormous  financial  and  economic  impact  on  PMDCs.  On \naverage, the annual damage experienced by PDMCs is equivalent to between 2% and 7% of gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP).  However,  in  years  that  have  included  significant  natural  disasters, \nSamoa\u2019s economic losses have averaged almost 46% of GDP, the losses for Tonga averaged 30% \nof GDP, and the losses for Vanuatu averaged 14% of GDP. The replacement value of the damage \ncaused by the 2007 earthquake and tsunami in the Solomon Islands is estimated at $100 million, or \naround 80% of the 2007 budget. The potential social and economic dislocation caused by a natural \ncatastrophe in a small island nation is extreme.  \n                                                 \n1  The PDMCs comprise Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, \nPalau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.  \n2  The 16 Pacific Islands Forum members include 13 PDMCs (Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, \nMicronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu) and Australia, \nNew Zealand, and Niue. \n3  Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. 2005. Pacific Plan for Strengthening Regional Cooperation and Integration. Fiji \nIslands: Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat.  \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 June 2008.  \n ", "2   \n6.  Historically, PDMC governments have not paid much attention to hedging against such \ndisasters largely because the most severe natural hazards occur infrequently, insurance against \nsuch events is either unavailable or prohibitively expensive, and when such events do occur there is \na willingness on the part of donors to provide post-disaster funding.  \n \n7.  Human activity-induced climate change is considered to raise the likelihood of catastrophic \nevents in the Pacific region. ADB\u2019s climate risk studies in six PDMCs5 examined the likelihood of \nclimate-related risks (high rainfall events and drought, high sea levels, strong winds, and high air \ntemperatures). All climate-related risks showed increases as a result of global warming. There is \nalready evidence of the impacts of climate change in PDMCs. For example, an increase in the \nfrequency of severe cyclones has recently been experienced in Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Samoa, \nand Vanuatu.  \n \n8.  PMDCs have recognized the need to be better placed to respond to the impacts of what are \nbecoming  more  frequent  events.  Climate  risk  management  and  adaptation  measures  (beyond \ndisaster preparedness) to respond to climatic extremes are steadily being incorporated into national \nplans  and  development  schemes  with  the  support  of  development  partners. However,  having \naccess to information is essential to be able to effectively plan for adaptation to climate change. \nThis includes information about the probability of catastrophic events occurring in a particular \nlocation, an understanding of the value and ownership of assets threatened by natural disasters, \nand information about the likely economy-wide impacts of such events. Information also needs to \nbe accessible and able to be easily manipulated by users. \n \n9.  In the Pacific region, information on major natural disasters is collected at a variety of \nlocations  within  and  outside  the  region.  The  Pacific  Ocean\u2019s  weather  and  seismic  activity  is \nvariously observed by agencies based in Australia, Fiji Islands, New Zealand, and United States. \nThis framework for catastrophe monitoring, while working effectively as a monitoring and warning \nsystem, means there is no single Pacific-wide snapshot of hazard risk. At the regional level hazard \ninformation collection and modeling is poorly developed in the Pacific, although the Pacific Islands \nApplied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC) has developed expertise and capacity in these areas.  \n \n10.  World Bank is undertaking a TA in the Pacific region: the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Pool \nInitiative. The TA\u2019s objective is to ensure short-term liquidity to Pacific island states in the aftermath \nof natural disasters, through developing a menu of market-based financial solutions, including the \ncreation of a regional catastrophe risk pool.6 During the first phase of the TA, data will be gathered \nand country-specific catastrophe risk models will be developed for a limited but representative \nnumber of countries: Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, \nTonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. These models will be used to develop country-specific loss risk \nprofiles and to assess the feasibility of catastrophe risk financing and insurance options. This will \nact to collate sound geophysical information as a basis for an insurance scheme. ADB has also \ndeveloped hazard risk data in the course of various projects and TA.  \n \n11.  ADB is well placed to facilitate the consolidation of a regional hazard risk and exposure \ndatabase given its in-depth knowledge of PDMCs, its relationships with donors, and its reputation \nwith the private sector. ADB can play a catalytic role in compiling such information and supporting \nits use for policy making. It is envisaged that the TA will strengthen partnerships among PDMCs, \ndevelopment partners, and the private sector through creating a dataset which is of interest to these \nparties. The TA would also support the emphasis placed upon disaster preparedness in the Pacific \n                                                 \n5  Climate risk profiles have been prepared for Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, \nMarshall Islands, and Samoa.  \n6  World Bank. 2007.

The Pacific regional operations business plan (2007\u20132010) indicates ADB\u2019s commitment to \nworking with other organizations to develop regional partnerships for climate change adaptation and \ndisaster preparedness.7 ADB\u2019s involvement in this area would thus be a practical demonstration of \nits support to address the impacts of climate change.  \n \n13.  There is further potential for partnerships on this issue. In conjunction with the Japanese \nMinistry of Finance, ADB will hold a conference on catastrophe insurance in November 2008 in \nTokyo,  Japan,  which  will  be  supported  under  the  TA  for  Natural  Catastrophe  Risk  Insurance \nMechanisms for the Asia and Pacific Region (financed by the Japan Special Fund).8 Japan\u2019s role as \na lead donor in the Pacific region has facilitated the inclusion of a workshop for PDMCs which will \nprovide an opportunity to present the TA objectives to a wide audience. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  This impact of the TA will be mitigation of the financial risk of participating PDMCs from the \neffects of natural disasters, including those exacerbated by human activity-induced climate change. \nThe outcome of this TA will be an improved geophysical information system that supports greater \nresilience to climate impacts and shocks through facilitating government decision-making on hazard \nexposure and risk minimization. The TA will also support an assessment of the feasibility of a \nregional pooled catastrophe insurance scheme and its subsequent development.  \n \n15.  The use of the information system, once developed, will support informed decision-making \naimed at minimizing the negative social and environmental impacts of catastrophic events. The \noutputs will support the work of the Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission and national \norganizations in hazard risk management and vulnerability assessment. The outputs of the TA will \nalso form a component of broader work on the feasibility of a catastrophe insurance facility for the \nPacific region that is being led by the World Bank. The outputs of the TA will provide lessons for any \nreplication undertaken in other sub-regions.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The TA will support the development of up to eight national databases, and a consolidated \nregional  database  encompassing  risk,  hazard,  and  vulnerability  data  critical  to  the  future \ndevelopment of a Pacific regional catastrophe insurance scheme and vital to inform government \ndecision- making regarding adaptation to natural catastrophes.9 The PDMCs included are those \nmost  exposed  to  the  risk  of  earthquakes  and  cyclones.  The  databases  will  build  upon  the \ninformation gathered by World Bank in their development of country-specific risk models. The \ndatabase will utilize a geographic information systems (GIS) platform, already in use across the \nPacific, to enable the easy manipulation of data for presentation that facilitates public policy and \ndecision-making. This will contribute to improved geophysical information in the Pacific region.  \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2007.

Database development will be conducted through national stakeholder consultations in each \nparticipating PDMC to build an understanding and awareness of the objectives of the TA and to \nassess the baseline situation in-country with regard to the compilation and use of hazard and risk \ninformation. This will be complemented through the collection and analysis of national information \nfrom hazard monitoring agencies both within and outside the region.  \n \n18.  Ensuring maximum utilization of the information within the developed databases is critical to \nthe longer-term success of the TA. The regular use of the information will help ensure that the \ndatabases  are  kept  up  to  date.  This  will  be  promoted  by  involving  policy  makers,  including \nrepresentatives  from  central  economic  and  planning  agencies,  in  stakeholder  consultations, \nmeetings, and relevant training to develop an awareness of the type of information available and its \nrange of uses. During implementation of the TA, regular consultations with stakeholders\u2014including \nPDMCs\u2014will be undertaken through various national and sub-regional meetings to be financed by \nthe TA and from other sources. \n \n19.  In identifying and implementing an appropriate GIS platform, the systems already in use in \neach country will be assessed and coordination with regional bodies involved in implementing GIS \nprograms, including the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), will be essential to ensure \ncompatibility with existing systems. Compatibility will greatly expand the pool of potential users \nsince a trained group of users will already be present in-country.  \n \n20.  The final step will involve consolidating the national databases into a regional system. A \nweb-based system for automatically uploading national updates to the regional database will be \ndeveloped and made accessible through a standardized and centralized GIS platform. Towards the \nend of TA implementation, a regional stakeholder meeting will be held to assess outcomes and \nidentify potential future actions.  \n \n21.  The risks of the TA relate primarily to the availability of primary data and proxy data as \nrequired.  Information  is  not  located  in  each  PDMC,  but  instead  resides  with  various  external \nagencies. As a result, collation, cleaning, and filling gaps becomes reliant on strong stocktaking to \nidentify the sources of quality data, and upon the willingness of the holders of data to share \ninformation. These risks are reduced as significant data collation has already been done by the \nWorld Bank for use in their analysis of catastrophe insurance options. There is also a risk regarding \nthe uptake and practical use of the information produced as a result of the TA by governments, \nregional organizations, and development partners. A lack of capacity at the national and regional \nlevel is a risk factor, with this risk being minimized by including training in the use of the data, and a \nstrong  focus  on  its  policy  uses,  in  stakeholder  discussions.  A  strong  consultative  process  in \ndatabase development and buy-in by participating governments is needed to minimize such risks. \nThe risk of insufficient country participation is considered low given that this TA was initiated at the \nrequest of PMDCs. In addition, an agreement on housing the regional database within a regional \norganization will be developed. SOPAC is the primary candidate for this role and has a strong track \nrecord in the area of disaster and risk management. This has been discussed with SOPAC which \nhas expressed keen interest in housing the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,120,000. ADB will provide $1,000,000 financed on a grant \nbasis from the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility. The participating PDMC governments will contribute a \ntotal  of  $120,000  equivalent  through  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  meeting \nfacilities, and administrative services. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  ADB, through its Pacific Department, will be the executing agency (EA) for the TA. The TA \nwill be implemented over a 24-month period from January 2009\u2013December 2010. The ministries of \nfinance or planning will be the implementing agencies in each participating country.  \n \n24.  The TA requires an estimated 25 person-months of international consulting services to be \nrecruited through a firm by ADB using quality- and cost-based selection (with a simplified technical \nproposal), using an 80/20 weight for quality and cost. The team will comprise a team leader\u2013risk \nassessment specialist (10 person-months), geoscientist (10 person-months), and a GIS specialist \n(5 person-months), all of whom will provide services intermittently. The consultants will be engaged \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). The detailed terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n25.  The team of consultants will work in close coordination with World Bank as the repository of \nthe information collected during its initial catastrophe insurance feasibility study, and with SOPAC \nas the key repository of geophysical data in the region and potential home of the regional database. \nCoordination  with  SPC  will  also  be  important  as  SPC  has  established  GIS  platforms  in  all \nparticipating PDMCs as part of its demography and statistics program. Ensuring compatibility with \nexisting systems will promote sustained system use.  \n \n26.  The  budget  provides  for  computers  and  related  equipment  for  participating  PDMCs  as \nrequired. The computers and equipment will be procured by the team leader, with prior approval \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Department,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended as from time to time), and will be kept by the PDMC after project completion. The \ninternational consultants will provide their own computers. Disbursements under the TA will be \nmade in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n27.  Given the expected use of the database in each PDMC, the TA will be directly coordinated \nwith  counterparts  from  the  ministries  of  finance  and  planning,  although  in  each  country  a \nstakeholders committee will be developed to assess implementation of the TA and to support \nutilization and updating of the national database produced under the TA. The outcomes of the TA \nwill be disseminated though a stakeholders\u2019 workshop involving representatives of participating \ncountries and development partners. The workshop will also provide an opportunity to focus on the \npolicy and decision-making use of the data compiled.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n28.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of TA not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nRegional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Fund  under  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration \nFinancing  Partnership  Facility  for  Regional  Partnerships  for  Climate  Change  Adaptation  and \nDisaster Preparedness, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance  Data Sources and/or \nDesign  Assumptions \nTargets and/or  Reporting \nSummary  and Risks \nIndicators  Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nMitigated financial risk  \u2022  Disaster mitigation  \u2022  National budgets of  \u2022  Governments utilize \nof participating Pacific  measures in large  participating  geophysical information in \ndeveloping member  national projects   countries  decision-making \ncountries (PDMCs) to  \u2022  Reduced demand  \u2022  Development  \u2022  Geographic information \nthe effects of natural  for emergency  partner reports  systems (GIS) supports \ndisasters, including  financial assistance  \u2022  Monitoring of  development of a \nthose exacerbated by  following natural  emergency requests  catastrophe insurance \nhuman-induced climate  disasters  facility \nchange   \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved geophysical  \u2022  Access to  \u2022  Technical  \u2022  Ease of use of GIS \ninformation that  geophysical  assistance (TA)  \u2022  Wide access to GIS \nsupports greater  information in key  monitoring   \nresilience to climate  government  \u2022  Regional \nimpacts and shocks  departments and  stakeholder meeting \nregional  outcomes \norganizations \n\u2022  Geophysical \ninformation utilized \nby over 150 policy \nmakers in the eight \nparticipating \ncountries in the \nmonth following its \ncompletion \nOutputs  \u2022  National    Assumptions \n1.
