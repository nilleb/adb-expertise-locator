THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $25,000,000 in Exacta Asia Investment II, L.P. (Exacta II), a fund investing in \nSoutheast Asia. \n \n2.  Exacta II will invest growth equity into lower middle-market companies in Southeast Asia \naccording to investment themes relating to domestic consumption and export-driven growth.1  \nExacta II\u2019s strategy will take advantage of expansion in the manufacturing, technology and service \nsectors, driven by the region\u2019s young population, rising middle class and inexpensive labor force. \nInvesting in Exacta II would allow ADB to participate in Southeast Asia\u2019s continued economic \ngrowth while providing development benefits. ADB\u2019s investment will help to deepen capital \nmarkets in the Southeast Asian countries for lower and middle-market companies who often \nstruggle to find targeted growth equity. \n \nII.  THE FUND \n   \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Description. Exacta Capital Partners (Exacta) is a private equity fund manager that \ninvests in companies in Southeast Asia.2 Exacta succeeds Mizuho ASEAN Investment GP \n(MAI GP),3 which Kota Igarashi and Mizuho Bank, Ltd. established in early 2013, as the general \npartner of Mizuho ASEAN Investment L.P. (Fund I),4 the predecessor of Exacta II.5 Exacta invests \nin lower middle-market companies whose growth is driven by domestic consumption and/or \nexports, and has built in-depth knowledge and expertise in industries such as food and beverages, \nhealth care, business services, and manufacturing. Exacta employs 12 staff, including eight \ninvestment professionals based in Bangkok, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore. \n \n4.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. 6 \n \n5.  Exacta II, a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership, is a closed-end private equity \nfund with a target capitalization of $250 million. The fund\u2019s general partner, Exacta, is a Cayman \nIslands exempted limited partnership. Exacta will appoint Mizuho Asia Partners Pte. Ltd., a private \ncompany with limited liability incorporated in Singapore, as its investment advisor to provide \ninvestment advisory and administrative services to the fund. \n \n \n1  Exacta II intends to invest in lower middle-market companies, defined as companies with typical enterprise value of \n$25 million\u2013$125 million, to comprise its primary investable universe. \n2  Exacta will only invest in developing member countries of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). It expects to invest \nprimarily in the core target countries of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam, which \ncollectively constitute 95% of the investments of Mizuho ASEAN Investment L.P. (Fund I). Exacta may also invest \nopportunistically in Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Myanmar. Exacta anticipates investments \nin Singapore to primarily benefit ADB\u2019s developing member countries in Southeast Asia. Exacta II documentation \ncontains limits on the amount of any investment by Exacta II in companies that are primarily active in Singapore. \n3  Exacta has the same management team as MAI GP. \n4  Kota Igarashi is Exacta\u2019s chief executive officer. [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception \nto disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. Further information, including integrity disclosure, \nis in Ownership, Management, and Governance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  References to Exacta include, as applicable, its predecessor, MAI GP. \n6 [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n ", "2 \n6.  Investment identification. Southeast Asia is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economic \nregions, but it also has one of the lowest private equity penetration rates globally.7 The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) identified Exacta through its dialogue with 15 private equity funds that \ninvest in Southeast Asia. ADB initiated discussion with Exacta in September 2015 and has \nactively tracked the platform since then. Through its due diligence, ADB found Exacta to possess \na strong culture of ownership among its investment team and a strong alignment of interests with \nits investors.8 The team appears to be cohesive, with no senior member departures since the \nplatform\u2019s inception. Through Fund I, Exacta has demonstrated its ability to invest in lower middle-\nmarket companies, helping these companies improve their operations and exiting one investment \nprofitably. Notwithstanding its 5-year track record, Exacta ranks favorably among comparable \ngrowth private equity funds in Southeast Asia according to Preqin data.9 Investing in Exacta II \nwould allow ADB to participate in Southeast Asia\u2019s continued economic growth while potentially \nproviding  significant  development  benefits.  Exacta  will  also  enable  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector \nOperations Department to rebalance ADB\u2019s private equity fund portfolio\u2019s geographic exposure in \nSoutheast Asia. ADB therefore views the proposed investment in Exacta II to be aligned with its \nprivate equity fund investment guidelines and a strong addition to its private equity fund portfolio. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n7.  Exacta II intends to invest $10 million\u2013$40 million per transaction in 10\u201315 investee \ncompanies with a typical holding period of 3\u20135 years. In instances where capital may be deployed \nover multiple tranches as a portfolio company scales up, the total investment size may be larger \nand additional co-investment capital may be sought from its investors. Exacta may commit a \nportion of ADB\u2019s capital toward listed companies and opportunistic investments (such as pre-initial \npublic offering financing and private investment in public companies) to create early liquidity \nopportunities for investors. \n \n8.  While Exacta\u2019s investment approach focuses on individual stock picking across multiple \nsectors, it will also employ top\u2013down portfolio construction principles to achieve the appropriate \ndiversification benefits. Given the demographic and economic profile of Southeast Asia, Exacta \nhas two major investment focuses: domestic consumption-driven businesses and export-oriented \nmanufacturing companies in Southeast Asia. Exacta aims to be mostly an active minority investor, \neven  though  its  deal  team  has  the  skills  and  experience  to  invest  in  majority  stakes \nopportunistically. Exacta II aims to exit investments primarily via trade sales, initial public offerings \n(IPOs), and share buybacks by the founders and/or majority shareholders. \n \n9.  Exacta invests in businesses where there is strong alignment of interests between the \nfounders of target companies and the fund. To aid in monitoring and to provide value-added \nstrategic guidance to management teams, Exacta will typically take on board seats in its investee \ncompanies.  Exacta  has  demonstrated  its  value  to  investee  companies  by  introducing  new \ntechnology, operational expertise, and proven brand names (products and services) from Japan \nto investee companies. Value addition also typically involves Exacta\u2019s efforts to grow businesses \nregionally, leveraging its regional presence and network. \n \n7  UBS Group AG. 2017. Southeast Asia Private Equity Overview. Zurich. The report noted that Southeast Asia\u2019s private \nequity penetration of 0.2% is substantially lower than in markets such as the People\u2019s Republic of China (0.4%), India \n(0.4%), the Republic of Korea (1.0%), and the United States (2.5%). The report defines private equity penetration as \nthe average aggregate private equity investment as a percentage of total gross domestic product for a country or \nregion from 2013 to 2015. \n8  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n9  Preqin. Preqin is a leading source of data and intelligence for the alternative assets industry. \n ", "3 \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n10.  Ownership. Exacta II is an exempted limited partnership registered in the Cayman \nIslands.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \n11.  Management. [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to \ndisclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. Exacta has eight investment \nprofessionals and four staff in legal and compliance, technology, finance and accounting, and \nhuman resources. Exacta expects to employ at least 14 staff by the final close of the fund. \n \n12.  Exacta generally avoids auctions, where company valuation is typically higher because of \ncompetitive bidding, and prefers to invest in proprietarily sourced transactions. It usually requires \nrepresentation on the boards of the investee companies to provide strategic and operational \nguidance. Exacta has held at least one board seat in all but one of its Fund I portfolio companies. \n \n13.  Integrity due diligence was conducted.10 No significant or potentially significant integrity \nrisks were identified. ADB\u2019s review of the entity does not give ADB cause to believe that such \nentity was established or is being used for money laundering or terrorism financing. \n \n14.  Enhanced tax integrity due diligence was conducted.11 ADB\u2019s review does not give ADB \ncause to believe that the transaction is being used for cross-border tax evasion. \n \n15.  Governance structure. Exacta\u2019s investment process is structured in five phases and \nincludes two investment committee meetings. \n(i)  Sourcing  and  screening  phase.  The  deal  team  identifies  and  evaluates \ninvestment opportunities.12 \n(ii)  Preliminary review phase. This covers a commercial review of the company and \nthe industry, the identification of a transaction structure, and the development of a \npreliminary value-added program. \n(iii)  First investment committee meeting. The deal team obtains approval to incur \nexpenses for due diligence and other transaction fees. \n(iv)  Detailed review phase. This consists of detailed due diligence with the assistance \nof  external  advisors,  negotiation  of  transaction  documents,  and  continued \ndevelopment of a value-added program. \n(v)  Second investment committee meeting. The deal team obtains approval to \nexecute binding documentation and proceed with the investment. \n \n16.  Exacta will seek to put in place multiple exit strategies into each deal and considers the \nalignment of exit objectives as a key factor for investment. \n \n17.  In addition to the investment committee, Exacta will have an advisory committee to provide \noversight on governance matters, including the approval of actual or potential conflict of interests. \nThe advisory committee will also review Exacta II\u2019s valuation policy and the valuation of investee \n \n10 ADB. 2003.

The advisory committee will have up to seven members, who will be representatives \nof investors designated by the general partner. Exacta has confirmed that ADB will be represented \non  the  advisory  committee  and  Mizuho  Bank  can  nominate  one  member  to  the  advisory \ncommittee. Exacta will also establish an environmental, social, and governance subcommittee to \nadvise Exacta II on relevant matters. All advisory committee members will have the right to appoint \none representative to the environmental, social, and governance subcommittee. \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n \n18.

The Assistance \n \n20.  ADB will provide an equity investment of up to $25,000,000 in Exacta II. ADB\u2019s proposed \ninvestment will not exceed 25% of Exacta II\u2019s total committed capital and will not result in ADB \nbeing the single largest investor in the fund. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis of Expected Returns and Assumptions \n \n21.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].  \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  Exit strategy. Exacta II has a 10-year term from first closing, subject to two 1-year \nextensions upon the supermajority consent of the investors. Its anticipated exit strategies include \ntrade sales to local and foreign strategic buyers, IPOs on local or relevant international stock \nexchanges,  secondary  sales  to  other  private  equity  funds,  and,  where  appropriate,  share \nbuybacks by the founders and/or majority shareholders of the investee companies. \n \n23.  Reporting  arrangements.  Each  year,  Exacta needs  to  provide  ADB with  quarterly \nreports, annual reports, audited financial statements, quarterly and annual fund overview reports \nwith a short description of each portfolio company, annual environmental and social performance \nreports,  and  annual  development  effectiveness  monitoring  reports.  ADB  will  review  this \ninformation and follow up with Exacta if more information or clarification is needed. If the \ninformation from Exacta raises issues that could impair the value of ADB\u2019s investment in Exacta II, \nADB could decide to put the fund on a watch list for more frequent and detailed review. \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n24.  Promote private sector development. An investment in Exacta II is in line with ADB\u2019s \ngoal to address the unmet demand for private sector financing in Southeast Asia. Through this \n \n13 [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n ", "5 \ninvestment, ADB will help finance comparatively small to medium-sized companies in the region. \nExacta II also aims to increase business efficiency, labor productivity, and overall employment. \nADB\u2019s participation will, therefore, support the development of the private sector in countries \nwhere equity-related financing is limited and access to bank financing is difficult without hard \nassets as collateral. Moreover, through Exacta, ADB will foster regional cooperation through the \nknowledge transfer from Japan to Southeast Asia. \n \n25.  Raise  standards.  ADB  and  other  members  of  the  advisory  committee  will  provide \noversight on important governance matters, which are critical for companies to demonstrate as \nthey seek additional sources of growth capital. \n \n26.  Provide cofinancing opportunities. Exacta values ADB\u2019s ability to provide both debt and \nequity financing directly to portfolio companies to help them grow. In addition to providing capital \nfrom its own balance sheet, ADB can help mobilize additional financing from third-party sources. \n \nE.  Risks \n \n27.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n34.  Impacts. The proposed investment will support established and well-managed small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and middle-market companies in Southeast Asia in realizing \ntheir growth plans, thereby driving employment, tax generation, skills transfer, and regional trade. \nIt will also strengthen the capacity of domestic financial institutions to encourage and expand \naccess to banking, insurance and financial services for all. \n35.  Outcome.  The  financial  and  social  sustainability  of  private  equity  investments  in \nSoutheast Asia will be demonstrated. \n \n ", "6 \n36.  Outputs. Exacta II is established; and capital is invested among 10-15 companies within \nthe proposed five-year investment period. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n37.  Consistency with ADB strategy. The proposed investment supports ADB\u2019s Midterm \nReview of Strategy 2020 in two areas: (i) private sector development and operations and \n(ii) finance sector development.14 ADB\u2019s assistance is an equity commitment to a private equity \nfund  managed  by  a  seasoned  fund  manager  and  focused  on  investing  in  and  building \neconomically sustainable small and medium-sized enterprises in Southeast Asia, which aligns \nwith  the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020\u2019s  efforts  to  develop  financial  infrastructure  and \nproducts. \n \n38.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. Exacta II\u2019s investment \ngoals align strongly with ADB strategies to enhance the efficiency and transparency of equity \nmarkets, removing barriers to financing for small and medium-sized enterprises, and promoting \nsocial and inclusive growth. Exacta II\u2019s investments are also consistent with ADB\u2019s plans for \nfinancial sector operations, which prioritize the need to enhance access to finance for small and \nmedium-sized enterprises as part of the sector development agenda and the need to support the \nthree pillars of the real economy: households, SMEs, and infrastructure.15 Exit strategies such as \nIPOs and trade sales will also help develop the local capital markets in the region. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n39.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009).16 \n \n40.  Category FI. ADB has assessed the investment\u2019s potential environmental and social \nimpacts, its risks associated with Exacta II\u2019s existing or likely future portfolio (or both), and its \ncommitment and capacity for environmental and social management. Exacta II has adopted an \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS) that requires it to appraise and manage \ninvestments following the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards on \nEnvironmental  and  Social  Sustainability;  the  International  Labour  Organization\u2019s  core  labor \nstandards; the World Bank Group Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines; and other \nindustry-specific guidelines.17 The potential fund investee\u2019s business activities are not expected \nto require major infrastructure development or generate significant, adverse, irreversible, or \ndiverse environmental and social impacts or risks; require involuntary resettlement; or adversely \nor beneficially affect distinct and vulnerable ethnic minority communities. [This information has \nbeen removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy, \npara. 17.2.(v)]. \n   \n41.  Exacta II\u2019s ESMS requires it to screen investments against an exclusion list equivalent to \nADB\u2019s Prohibited Investment Activity List. Investments are classified as one of four environmental \nand social risk categories (A, B+, B, and C), which align with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n \n14 ADB. 2014.

Safeguard Categories. \n17 IFC. 2012. IFC Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability. Washington, DC; International \nLabour Organization. Conventions and Recommendations; and IFC. Environmental, Health, and Safety Guidelines. \n ", "7 \ncategory classifications. ESMS procedures and requirements for environmental and social due \ndiligence include the development and implementation of a corrective action plan, while the \ninvestment review and approval process explicitly requires inputs from the environmental and \nsocial due diligence. The ESMS also includes adequate procedures for required monitoring and \nreporting of approved investments. \n \n42.  ADB will require Exacta II to enhance its existing ESMS to ensure compliance with the \nSafeguard Policy Statement before ADB\u2019s first disbursement. Enhancements include guidance \non (i) the alignment of the ESMS investment risk categorization criteria to ADB\u2019s environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples categorization; (ii) the level of detail required \nfor environmental and social assessments; and (iii) information disclosure and consultation with \naffected people following ADB\u2019s requirements.18 While Exacta II has not declared an intention to \ninvest in companies engaged in business activities with category A impacts, the ESMS includes \nadequate procedures and requirements for screening, assessing, reviewing, implementing, and \nmonitoring category A investments. ADB will have the right to be excused from contributing capital \nto any proposed investment that it assesses as being noncompliant with the ESMS. \n \n43.  Exacta\u2019s environmental and social team will supervise all investees against environmental \nand social risks and any agreed time-bound action plans; and report the investees\u2019 performance \nto ADB through its annual ESMS reporting, which is due 90 days from the end of each financial \nyear. \n \n44.  No gender elements. Exacta II is limited in its capacity to generate measurable gender \nmainstreaming  outcomes  within  portfolio  companies.  The  ESMS  sets  out  requirements  for \ncompliance, as applicable, with (i) national labor laws; (ii) measures to comply with internationally \nrecognized core labor standards, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001); and \n(iii) information disclosure and consultation with affected people. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n45.  Exacta was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n \n46.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n47.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter), \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the governments of the \nADB member countries where the fund will invest have no objection to the proposed assistance \n \n18 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy; Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary; and Financial \nIntermediary: Environmental and Social Management System Arrangement (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nto  Exacta  II.19  ADB  will  enter  into suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and  substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nVI.
