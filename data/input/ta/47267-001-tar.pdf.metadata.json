The Government of Myanmar has requested support from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to develop the framework, processes, and institutional management structure for public\u2013\nprivate partnerships (PPPs) in Myanmar. ADB has been requested to focus first on the private \ninvestment initiatives of the Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP). Lessons from this work will then \nbe shared with the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development (MNPED) and \nother ministries to inform national-level PPP design and management. ADB, in its role as lead \nPPP development coordinator in Myanmar, has consulted extensively with the government, the \nprivate sector, and development partners through multiple missions undertaken from May 2013 \nto form the proposed technical assistance (TA).1 The government concurs with the impact, \noutcome, outputs, and key activities as presented in the design and monitoring framework in \nAppendix 1. The TA is included in the country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Government of Myanmar became a representative democracy in late 2010, at which \ntime  several  international  sanctions  were  lifted,  and  outstanding  sovereign  debts  were \nrestructured,  repaid  or  forgiven.  These  developments  removed  barriers  to  international \ninvestment, signaling a new era of growth and development. After decades of underinvestment \nin infrastructure and public services, the government has moved swiftly to advance national \ndevelopment by (i) embracing PPPs in core infrastructure investment areas in which the private \nsector has expressed interest; and (ii) capitalizing on strong development partner and bilateral \ngovernment offers of support to address development in areas not conducive to private sector \nparticipation, or where it is best to maintain government ownership. From the government\u2019s \nperspective, this strategy makes optimal use of available financial and human resources, with \nthe potential of achieving significant advances in national development. \n \n3.  The government, of its own volition, has begun various forms of PPPs in multiple sectors \nof  the  economy,  including  telecommunications,  electricity,  natural  resources,  housing,  civil \naviation, roads, and public transport. Rapid progress has been made in appointing private \nsector counterparts despite the absence of sector or national policy frameworks and attendant \nprocesses,  or  institutional  management  functions  dedicated  to  PPPs.  However  these \ndevelopments have yet to yield sustainable economic benefits for the government.   \n \n4.  The electric power sector has been a particular area of focus for application of this \nstrategy. Only 26% of the population is connected to the grid, and existing grid systems are in \nneed of major overhaul or replacement; consequently, the investment needs of the sector are \nstaggering.  To  address  this  challenge,  MOEP  is  engaged  with  ADB  and  other  donors  to \noverhaul and upgrade the existing state generation, transmission, and distribution system, and \nundertake advance planning and sector reforms through loan projects and TA.3  At the same \ntime, MOEP has indicated that it has signed more than 60 memorandums of understanding with \nprivate  sector  investors  to  prepare,  finance,  build,  and  operate  electric  power  generation \nprojects. On the basis of these memorandums, four private investor groups have commenced \nconstruction of power generation projects, even in the absence of government-signed power \n                                                \n1  ADB is currently the only development partner engaged in national level PPP framework and process support. \n2  ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: Myanmar, 2014\u20132016. Manila. The TA first appeared in the \nbusiness opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 November 2013. \n3  Electric power sector development is being supported by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the World \nBank, and a number of bilateral governments agencies. See Supplementary Appendix A for an overview of \nproposed development partner programs. \n ", "2   \npurchase agreements. Chamber of commerce and industry observers have raised concerns that \nthe direct negotiation of these private power generation projects may yield high electricity prices \nover long time periods, and may serve to constrain industrial growth. MOEP is therefore keen to \nmove  to  a  competitive  bidding  approach  to  power  generation  procurement,  supported  by \ncontracts and processes that meet international PPP standards, in order to establish price \nbenchmarks and assure fair and balanced outcomes. \n \n5.  The attraction of significant, underdeveloped natural resources combined with large-\nscale investment opportunities has encouraged foreign investors to flock to Myanmar. Investors \nhave lodged numerous unsolicited proposals with the government, which vary widely in quality \nand intent. While such proposals may appear attractive in that they address core development \nneeds, the government has little basis on which to evaluate whether the proposals and their \nproponents are of good quality, offer fair terms and conditions, and will deliver sustainable \ncommercial,  financial,  and  economic  value.  However,  given  the  magnitude  of  Myanmar\u2019s \ndevelopment  hurdles,  and  the  absence  of  sufficient  technical  capacity  and  funding  within \ngovernment to develop projects themselves, the government has felt compelled to consider \nthese proposals.  This has resulted in an ad hoc approach to project selection and negotiations, \nmaking it difficult for the government to determine if it is achieving value for money. The \ngovernment urgently needs to assert control over the development process and become more \nproactive in directing investment outcomes, while capitalizing on the current investor interest in \nthe country. This will require development of appropriate policies and processes, identification of \nprioritized  sector  development  projects,  and  use  of  improved  tendering  processes  and \ndocumentation, backed by an enhanced institutional planning and management structure. In this \nprocess, the government can benefit from the large body of international PPP experience. It is in \nthis  context  that  the  government  has  requested  ADB  support  for  development  of  a  PPP \nframework.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact of the TA will be to establish a strategy and plan to mobilize and manage \nPPPs in infrastructure at a national level. The outcome of the TA will be improved institutional \ncapacity to direct and manage PPPs at the individual ministerial level. The impact will be \nmeasured by the creation of a national level PPP strategy by the end of FY2018, and the \noutcome will be measured by the establishment of at least one PPP institutional management \nunit within a sector ministry by FY2015. MOEP will be the initial beneficiary of TA support, and \nits experience will help inform national-level PPP development and management under the \nguidance of and in consultation with MNPED. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will provide the government with the tools to better direct and balance PPP \nproject outcomes in the short term, and enable more holistic, sustainable national management \nof PPPs. For MOEP, the TA will help the government establish fair and balanced terms for \nprivate sector investment in power generation projects, establish principles for international \ncompetitive  tendering,  assist  the  government  in  prioritizing  PPP  investment  projects,  and \nstrengthen the design and management of future PPP procurement. This will evolve into a \nsector-based  strategy  for  PPP  project  identification,  implementation,  and  management. \nUltimately, sector level experience will help shape the nature of the national strategy and plan.  \n \n ", "  3 \n8.  The  TA  will  provide  the  government  with  draft  tools,  policies  and  organizational \nstructures  to  better  plan  and  manage  PPP  procurement. 4 It  will  do  so  by  providing \nrecommendations on how to apply the PPP experience of MOEP nationally, informing the \napplication of the framework to other ministries considering or engaging in PPPs. As appropriate, \nthe TA will help determine, in close consultation with government, the nature of a prospective \nnational PPP management structure, and how to develop deeper PPP management capabilities \nwithin specific sectors.  \n \n9.  The  TA  will  (i)  deliver  to  the  government  sound  tendering  processes  and  decision \nframeworks  based  on  PPP  principles;  (ii)  promote  consistent,  objective,  and  transparent \napplication of PPP project development criteria to an international standard; and (iii) create \nrecommendations for development of institutional management capacity for PPPs, first within \nMOEP and then at the national level.  This work is encompassed in three outputs: \n \na.  Output 1:  Institutional structure for managing public\u2013private partnership \nprojects and finances developed.  This output will support development of an \ninstitutional basis for managing the selection, tendering, and implementation of \nPPP  projects.  Work  under  this  output  will  first  focus  on  MOEP  to  identify \ninstitutional and fiscal management requirements within the electric power sector. \nThe TA will then use this experience to help determine resources, capabilities \nand management structure needed for national management of PPPs. Overall, \nwork under this output will provide support to the government to enable it to (a) \nproperly  and  consistently  identify,  develop,  and  procure  PPP  projects  within \nsectors; and (b) manage financial risks potentially arising from PPPs at the sector \nlevel, and in aggregate at the national level. The PPP management activities \nunder the TA will support development and adoption of an institutional framework \nand attendant policies and processes; the financial management activities under \nthe TA will develop means to capture, quantify, and report the potential impacts \nof PPP contractual obligations on sector operations and budgets, or through \ncreation of contingent liabilities.  \n \nb.  Output 2: Ministry of Electric Power private sector investment management \ncapacity  improved.  The  TA  will  provide  support  to  MOEP  to  improve  its \napproach to identifying, designing, managing, tendering, and negotiating private \nsector  participation  in  the  electric  power  sector.  Using  existing  principles  of \ncompetitive  bidding  and  procurement  criteria,5 the  TA  will  further  refine  and \nestablish criteria, processes, analytic methods, and documentation to provide a \nsound basis for government tendering of projects with private sector participation, \nprepared  to  an  international  standard.  The  TA  will  help  MOEP  assess  its \ninvestment pipeline to prioritize projects for competitive bidding, and, for a subset \nof these projects, undertake analysis to generate preliminary project profiles. The \nTA will recommend steps by which to prepare short-listed projects for tendering. \n \nc.  Output 3: Public\u2013private partnership knowledge shared. The TA will facilitate \nstakeholder consultations and awareness raising with respect to PPPs. It will \n                                                \n4  The government requested this bottom-up approach given that it is already engaged with several prospective \nprivate sector investors. Starting with a top-down framework would do little to mitigate the potential risks associated \nwith currently proposed projects. \n5  ADB has provided advanced support to develop a competitive bidding framework and certain contract and process \ndocumentation through consultants provided under ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Union \nof Myanmar for Capacity Development and Institutional Support. Manila.   \n ", "4   \nsupport dissemination of information on regional and global approaches to PPP \npolicies, practices and projects, and information on recommended approaches \nfor Myanmar. Workshops will be conducted to help relevant government entities \nunderstand and adopt PPP principles, seek feedback to refine such principles in \nthe Myanmar context, and provide training on how to apply them to projects and \nimprove government capacity to manage PPPs. The TA will help the government \nlearn from experienced regional and international PPP entities regarding their \nexperience in developing, implementing, and managing PPPs, with respect to \nelectric  power  and  other  sectors.6 A  national  web  portal  for  PPPs  will  be \ndeveloped  to  share  information  about  national  PPP  policy  and  project \ndevelopments; this will serve as a platform for ongoing dissemination of PPP \ndevelopments in Myanmar. 7 \n \n10.  The government recognizes the risks that can arise from ministries\u2019 continued reliance \non directly appointed, negotiated bases for pursuing PPP projects. It seeks immediate support \nto help strengthen the broader government\u2019s understanding and use of PPPs on a competitive \ntender basis. The TA has prioritized work with the MOEP as it is both a ministry with a large \nprogram of prospective PPP projects needing support and has the political will to pursue a \ntransition to transparent selection and negotiation of PPP projects. The TA will also help to build \nPPP awareness among and integrate the operations of associated ministries that must be \nconsulted as part of PPP framework or project development activities. \n \n11.  TA implementation could be impacted by changes in civil service or political leadership \nthat  may  occur  during  development  of  institutions  responsible  for  PPPs.  This  could  occur \nthrough the shifting of personnel or the restructuring of ministries during TA implementation. \nMinisterial staff require material capacity development to better manage PPP-related activities. \nWhile the TA will undertake capacity building activities, there is risk that the government may \nseek to advance PPP project implementation ahead of completing needed training. To help \nmitigate this risk, the ministries involved have undertaken to form a core PPP task force and \nsteering committee to work with the TA consulting team throughout TA implementation.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,020,000 of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Government of the United Kingdom and administered by ADB. ADB and the \nGovernment  of  the  United  Kingdom  will  enter  into  an  appropriate  grant  arrangement  to \ndocument  roles,  actions  and  responsibilities.  The  Government  of  Myanmar  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, communications \nfacilities, and other in-kind contributions.  The cost estimate is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The TA will commence 1 April 2014 and finalize deliverables by 30 September 2015; \nfinal closure of the TA will be by 31 December 2015. MNPED will serve as the executing agency \n                                                \n6  Preliminary proposals are to examine the case of private power investment in the Philippines energy market, \nthrough consultations with the Department of Energy, as well as the Philippine experience in developing its \nrevamped PPP Center. Interaction with either the United Kingdom Private Finance Initiative under HM Treasury or \nthe Public and Private Investment Management Center, Korean Development Institute are also proposed. In \naddition, case studies on private power investment programs in relevant countries are proposed.   \n7  Website ownership will vest with the government and, as part of counterpart funding, it will be responsible for \nmaintaining the website upon TA conclusion. The TA will train government staff to modify and maintain the website.  \n ", "  5 \nand MOEP as the implementing agency. MOEP will nominate a multi-disciplinary task force to \ndevelop and implement MOEP PPP arrangements. A coordinating committee will be established \namong broader government agencies and managed by MNPED.8 Together, MNPED and MOEP \nwill serve as focal points for the TA and provide consultative bodies for the development of \nframeworks,  organizational  design,  and  operating  criteria.  The  coordinating  committee  will \nfacilitate inter-ministerial consultation regarding policy, approvals or decision making that falls \noutside the authority or relevant scope of MNPED and MOEP, and will support national-level \napproval of key policy and process outputs from the TA. For output 2, MOEP will be required to \nprovide all available information, access to sites, and any needed support to gather information \nneeded by the TA team in assessing candidate PPP projects. \n \n14.  To ensure timely and efficient coordination with the government and to help guide TA \ndelivery, ADB will commit approximately 8 person-months of staff resource-person services over \nthe term of the TA.9 The TA will finance consultant services (43.5 person-months of international \nand  31.6  person-months  of  national  consultant  services).  All  consultants  will  be  recruited \nthrough a firm (except those experts whose early mobilization is necessary to undertake initial \nactivities) using quality- and cost-based selection, with a quality-cost ratio of 80:20. Consultants \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Goods  and  services  to  be  financed  from  the  TA  will  be  in \naccordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Items \nestimated to cost less than $100,000 will be procured through shopping. TA proceeds will be \ndisbursed in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time).  An overview of the consultant terms of reference is provided in \nAppendix 3. \n \n15.  The  TA  consultant  team,  drawing  from  periodic  progress  reports  produced  by  the \nconsultants  in consultation  with  MNPED  and MOEP,  will  regularly  document TA  progress, \nchallenges encountered, and solutions proposed over the implementation period. Stakeholder \ncommunications, including publications and workshops, will be produced as a core output of the \nTA. Work products will highlight the support for the TA provided by the Government of the \nUnited  Kingdom.  Updates  on  TA  progress  and  outcomes  will  be  provided  to  ADB\u2019s  PPP \ncommunity of practice for further dissemination within ADB. Given the rapidly evolving nature of \nthe policy and investment environment in Myanmar, interim progress reports will be of critical \nimportance and will be used to provide inputs and feedback to help inform the direction of \nsubsequent work activities. The overall outcomes of the TA will be published on a government \nwebsite developed under the TA, to support broad distribution of new policies, processes, \ninvestment opportunities and opportunities for consultation. An international PPP forum will be \nheld at the end of the TA to disseminate information on the PPP program and prospective \ninvestment opportunities.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION  \n \n16.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to the Government of Myanmar to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom for Support for Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnership Framework Development. \n                                                \n8  The coordinating committee will consist of representatives of the Ministry of Energy and Ministry of Finance, with \nad hoc participation from the Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forests and members of the National \nEnergy Management Committee. It is expected that the President\u2019s office may become involved at a later stage. \n9  It is expected that ADB staff will participate as resource persons in the areas of PPP, procurement, safeguards, \nand public financial management.  For ADB resource persons, only travel costs are included in the TA budget. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary \nIndicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nA strategy and plan to  A national level strategy  Government  Government sustains \nmobilize and manage  and plan for PPPs is  announcement of a  the political will to \npublic\u2013private  adopted by the end of  national PPP strategy  pursue private sector \npartnerships in  FY2018  participation in public \ninfrastructure is  (Baseline: no strategy,  projects \nestablished.
