INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Coal accounts for 29% of global primary energy use and it contributes to almost half of all \nglobal carbon dioxide emissions.1 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates \nthat, to keep global temperature increase to below 1.5\u00b0C, coal-fired power generation would need \nto decrease by 80% within this decade and be fully decommissioned by 2050. However, coal \nremains a major fuel source responsible for almost 38% of electricity generation worldwide in \n2018 and for a staggering 59% in Asia. Further, as of 2019, Asia accounts for 78% of all planned \nand under-construction  coal  power  plants.2 While  solar photovoltaic  and  wind power  have \nbecome cost competitive in recent years, direct and indirect subsidies artificially reduce the cost \nof using coal for utilities. The International Monetary Fund recently estimated that subsidies and \nenvironmental and health-related externalities of fossil fuel generation is equivalent to 6.5% of the \nglobal gross domestic product.3 \n \n2.  Nonetheless, some recent, encouraging changes suggest a possible change in the current \nglobal energy trend. Firstly, several international institutional investors and banks are starting to \nincorporate environmental, social and governance indicators into their business strategies, which \nsupport divesting from coal assets and banning financing of coal operations. Secondly, stranding \nrisks  are  becoming a  reality  in  various electricity  markets,  as  the  introduction  of  low-cost \nrenewable energy capacity is displacing fossil-fueled power plants that often have higher marginal \ncosts. It is estimated that 39% of the world\u2019s existing coal power plants currently costs more to \ncontinue operating than installing and operating new onshore wind or solar photovoltaic with \nstorage (with 4-hour storage rated at half the renewable generation capacity), a share that is \nexpected  to  increase to  as high as 73% by 2025.4 Over  100  globally  significant  financial \ninstitutions are already acknowledging asset stranding risks, and have started exiting coal-related \ninvestments and operations5 (including some of the world\u2019s largest banks, insurance companies, \nand Blackrock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager)6 as greener policies, the lower levelized cost \nof renewable generation plus electricity storage, and the introduction of carbon pricing in energy \nmarkets increase the likelihood of coal-fired assets becoming stranded well before their technical \nlifetime ends. Similarly, under the Science-Based Targets initiative, 885 companies to date (which \nare large consumers of electricity in many developing member countries [DMCs]) have set climate \naction targets well-below the 2\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C trajectory.7 \n \n3.  A key barrier to accelerating the retirement of coal power generation is that most coal \npower plants are insulated from competition by long-term power purchase agreements and \nnoncompetitive tariffs. There are limited options to alter these arrangements without facing \npenalties and costs or protracted legal and political battles. Therefore, a phaseout approach to \ndealing with such legacy contractual arrangements and tariff structures would be to incentivize \ncoal power plant investors and owners to replace returns from the coal power plants with returns \n \n1  International Energy Agency. 2019.

Governments  and \ninternational financing institutions, like the Asian Development Bank (ADB), could support this \neffort by financing the coal transition, saving money to customers and taxpayers, and reducing \nlocal air pollution and carbon emissions. \n \n4.  While the early retirement of coal power plants might be technically or financially viable, \ndecarbonization efforts need to consider the significant impact on communities dependent on the \ncoal sector (so-called stranded regions), who will lose jobs and revenues. It is important that \ncommunities are not left behind in the transition to a low-carbon society.8 Such policies should \ninclude the restructuring plans of the coal sector, economic diversification plans for affected \nregions, fiscal measures for affected communities, incentives for investors, skills training, and \nopportunities for workers, with the ultimate objective of leaving affected communities better-off, \naccounting for different needs and challenges of disadvantaged groups, including women, ethnic \nminorities, and the poor. Building on its safeguard policies and a wealth of technical and financial \nassistance, ADB is well-placed to support this \u201cjust transition\u201d in DMCs.9 \n \n5.  Proposed solutions. The small-scale knowledge and support technical assistance (S-\nKSTA)  will  help  selected governments and  relevant  stakeholders  of  up  to  three  DMCs  in \nSoutheast Asia region, particularly the largest coal users,10 to analyze and assess the current and \nfuture costs of maintaining or expanding their coal power plant generation capacity in order to \ninitiate a phase out of coal power generation and substitute it with alternative cleaner energy \nsources, in a fair, inclusive, and balanced manner.  \n \n6.  The TA will assess the policy and regulatory environment under which coal power plants \nare operating in each DMC in order to understand the feasibility of acquiring, retiring and replacing \ncoal power plants. In addition, this assessment will include a review of each country\u2019s energy \npolicy, including incentives and subsidies for different technologies, a high-level view of the overall \ngeneration mix (operational, in construction, planned) and a forecast for energy demand to frame \nwhat role coal and renewables will need to play within each country\u2019s energy system. \n \n7.  Based on the results of the high-level screening, detailed financial analysis of 2\u20133 \nrepresentative power plants in each DMC will be undertaken. This individual plant analysis will be \nused to estimate the financial and economic value of a significant share, say 50%, of each \ncountry\u2019s coal fleet that could be retired early. This will include sensitivity analysis of the key \nfactors that will significantly affect the value, and account for indirect and direct subsidies that \nmight pertain to the existing coal-fleet in these DMCs. \n \n8.  The TA will also help define the terms of reference for a full feasibility study with a larger \nscope and timeframe, which would design the structure of a pilot Coal Replacement Fund (CRF) \naimed at replacing coal power generation with clean technologies, taking into consideration the \nrestructuring  of  the  sector  in  a  balanced  and  fair  manner,  particularly  for  the  affected \n \n8  T.

This work is to be procured in Q3 2021. The CRF could be funded by long-term investors \nthat can tap on very low funding costs, including public financing from each DMC, bilateral and \nmultilateral development organizations, and eventually private investors). In return, each DMC \nwill commit to an agreed schedule for decommissioning and replacement their coal power fleet, \nwith agreed standards for energy access, security and considerations for \u201cjust transition\u201d in the \naffected regions.  \n \nII.
