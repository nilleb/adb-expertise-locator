THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  India was among the world\u2019s fastest growing economies with an average annual gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  growth  of  6.6%  over  FY2013\u2013FY2020,  supported  by  sound \nmacroeconomic  management  and  economic  development  policies  that  have  contributed  to \nsubstantial reduction in poverty.1 The federal government\u2019s fiscal deficit averaged 3.6% during \nFY2016\u2013FY2020, lower than 4.8% in FY2011\u2013FY2015.2 India\u2019s external sector has remained \nstable with a narrowing of current account deficit, steady accumulation of foreign exchange \nreserves, and strong growth in foreign direct investment and portfolio inflows.  \n \n2.  In FY2021, GDP growth decelerated sharply to \u20137.3% because of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic but is expected to recover strongly with growth rates of 10.0% in FY2022 \nand 7.5% in FY2023.3 The government\u2019s economic reforms focus on a revival of investment \nmomentum; attracting strong inflows of foreign investment; strengthening the rural economy; \nencouraging start-ups; promoting domestic manufacturing by strengthening micro, small, and \nmedium  enterprises;  development  of  industrial  corridors  and  addressing  constraints  to \ninfrastructure  growth;  and  undertaking  other  logistics  reforms. The  government  is  targeting \nimproved competitiveness of domestic industry as the central theme of India\u2019s development \nstrategy. As core building blocks of this strategy, the government launched complementary \ninitiatives  for  growth  in  manufacturing  and  development  of  inland  and  coastal  waterways, \nindustrial and economic corridors, and air and rail connectivity.4 \n \n3.  A  modern  and  efficient  logistics  network  is  crucial  for  enhancing  economic \ncompetitiveness, particularly for manufacturing, services, and trade. Efficient movement of goods \nfrom production and distribution centers to consuming markets enables economic growth and \nhigher employment by making trade more competitive, improving producer margins, reducing \ntransaction costs, improving demand, and ensuring reduced carbon emissions.5 The logistics \ncosts were estimated about 14% of India\u2019s GDP and 18% of the final price of goods in 2017\u2014\nsubstantially higher than 8%\u20139% of GDP and 9%\u201310% of final price of goods for developed \nnations (footnote 8). In logistics performance, India ranked 44th of 160 economies in 2018, below \nJapan (5th), the Republic of Korea (25th), the People\u2019s Republic of China (26th), Thailand (32nd), \n \n1  Computed from the annual GDP data, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (accessed 2 June 2021). \n2  Reserve Bank of India. 2020. Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy 2019-20 (Table 232). Mumbai. \n3  ADB. 2021. Asian Development Outlook 2021 Supplement: Renewed Outbreaks and Divergent Recoveries. Manila \n(July). \n4  In November 2017, the government granted infrastructure status to the logistics industry to ease access to long-term \ncredit at lower rates. The development of logistics facilities and multimodal transport is a key component of the Make \nin India program. The government also launched complementary initiatives\u2014Sagarmala for port-led development in \n2015, and Bharatmala for road corridors in 2017\u2014to strengthen connectivity infrastructure. UDAN Regional \nConnectivity Scheme (2016) will connect 22 underserved airports to key airports, and the National Rail Plan (2020) \ntargets the development of a future-ready railway system by 2030. The government set up the National Highways \nLogistics Management Company to oversee the development of MMLPs and port connectivity projects. The \ngovernment also launched the Gati-Shakti (Speed-Strength) Masterplan in October 2021 for planned and synergetic \ndevelopment of logistics infrastructure and facilities across the country. \n5  (i) World Bank research in Latin America showed that reducing the share of logistics costs in the final price of goods \nby 14% can increase the demand for those goods by 8%\u201318% and increase employment by 2.5%\u201316%, (ii) India \nloses an estimated 40% of agricultural production to supply chain wastages, and (iii) carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions \nfrom logistics constituted 7% of the total CO2 emissions in India in 2018. In developed countries, it is common to see \n5%\u20136% of GDP in transportation costs, 2%\u20133% in inventory costs and 0.5%\u20131% in administrative and overhead. In \nIndia, transportation is approximately 7%, inventory 6.3%, and admin and overhead 0.7%. NITI Aayog, Government \nof India and Rocky Mountain Institute. 2018. Goods on the Move- Efficiency and Sustainability in Indian Logistics. \nGlobal Mobility Summit. Delhi.  \n ", "2 \n \nViet Nam (39th), and Malaysia (41st).6 The core development problem in India is that the logistics \nindustry is fragmented across multiple ministries and agencies while an overarching policy and \ninstitutional framework for coordinated development is lacking. This has resulted in multiple \nregulations  and  programs  governed  by  various  ministries,  fragmented  development  of \ninfrastructure and services and consequent lack of economies of scale, use of unintegrated digital \nplatforms by different agencies that impede the ability for inter-operability, and inefficiencies in \nexternal trade logistics.  \n \n4.  The Strengthening Multimodal and Integrated Logistics Ecosystem (SMILE) program is a \nprogrammatic  policy-based  loan  (PBL)  to  support  the  government  undertake  wide-ranging \nreforms in the logistics sector in India. The program aims to strengthen the institutional and policy \nframework  for  interministerial  coordination  and  planning  for  incentivizing  private  sector \nparticipation in multimodal logistics projects, improve efficiencies in external trade logistics, and \nencourage  the  use  of  smart  and  automated  systems  for  improved  service  delivery.  The \ngovernment has requested a regular loan of $500 million from Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2019s \n \nordinarycapital resources to help finance the program. The proposed programmatic PBL modality \ncomprises two subprograms of $250 million each, in FY2022 and FY2024, respectively, and will \nbe supported by a transaction technical assistance (TA).7 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n5.  The proposed transaction TA is being processed at the request of the Government of India \nto meet key capacity building needs, strengthen sector institutions, and conduct studies to further \ndeepen reforms and develop policy framework. The TA will support the implementing agencies in \nachieving the policy actions of the ensuing SMILE program. The TA will thus provide capacity \nbuilding support to foster coordination among the different tiers of government and among the \nvarious institutions. The TA will also extend support to diagnose emerging challenges in the sector \nand identify policy initiatives. The TA activities will build on and carryforward activities commenced \nunder earlier initiatives and replicate some successful interventions particularly in logistic planning \nand technology use for improving efficiency. \n \nB.

In addition, a parallel \ncofinancing of $100 million by the Export\u2013Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM) for subprogram 1 is under discussion with \nthe Government of India. However, this TA is not included in ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan: India, \n2021\u20132023. Manila.
