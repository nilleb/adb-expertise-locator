INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During the country programming review conducted in November 2006, the Government \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide  lending  support  for  the  Guangxi  Wuzhou  Urban  Development  Project.  A  project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA1) has been included in the ADB assistance program for \n2007 to help the Government prepare the project to meet ADB policy, operational, and loan \nprocessing requirements. At the request of the Government, ADB fielded a pre-fact-finding \nmission to visit Wuzhou City (Wuzhou), Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi) on 24\u2013\n27 April 2007 to undertake reconnaissance for the TA.The Fact-Finding Mission followed on 4\u20135 \nJuly 2007. Through these visits, the missions reached an understanding with the Government \nand Wuzhou municipal government (WMG) on all the aspects of the TA, including the impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost estimates and financing plan, and the \noutline terms of reference for consulting services to be provided. The agreed-upon TA design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Wuzhou is a medium-sized city of Guangxi\u2014one of the 12 less developed western \nprovinces and autonomous regions that are targeted by the Government for support under the \nNational Strategy for Development of the West. WMG has three urban districts, three counties, \nand one county-city under its jurisdiction. Wuzhou has a population of 3.11 million in a land area \nof 12,588 square kilometers (km2). In the context of the project, Wuzhou refers only to the city \nproper comprising the three urban districts of Changzhou, Dieshan, and Wanxiu. Wuzhou has \nan urban population of 452,000 and a developed urban area of 32.5 km2. The city is located at \nthe conjunction of two major rivers, Xunjiang River and Guijiang River, which then combine into \nXijiang River, upstream of Zhujiang River in the well-known Zhujiang Delta, one major growth \nengine of the PRC. Over the centuries, Wuzhou has served as a regional transportation hub \nconnecting  Guangxi  with  national  and  international  markets,  particularly  through  river \ntransportation.  \n \n3.  Wuzhou has developed very fast these years through the strengthening of its economic \nintegration  with  Zhujiang  Delta.  From  2000  to  2005,  Wuzhou  achieved  an  annual  gross \ndomestic product growth of 11.3%, and a steady increase of per capita income at an average \nrate of 10.6%. Registered unemployment is low at about 3%. According to the 11th Five-Year \nProgram  (FYP)  2006\u20132010,  Wuzhou  will  develop  into  a  regional  multimode  transportation \ncenter to connect Guangxi with Zhujiang Delta through six ongoing domestically funded major \ntransport projects comprising three expressway projects, two railway projects, and one river \ntransport strengthening project. A significant urban expansion is required to accommodate these \ninfrastructure  facilities  and  to  support  their  operations.  Urban  development  in  Wuzhou  is \nseverely constrained, however, by its geological conditions. The city is located in a mountainous \nregion divided by the two rivers into three parts. The city proper is on the north bank of Xunjiang \nRiver, and is further divided by Guijiang River into (i) the old urban center on the east side, and \n(ii) a fast-growing urban center on the west side. The south bank of Xujiang River remains to be \ndeveloped. Before the development of the new urban area on the west side of Guijiang River in \nthe 1980s, due to the limited level ground available around the old urban center, the residents \ntended to build their houses on the marginal lands that were gradually expanding upward on the \nmountains along the major valleys. The mountains in Wuzhou are mainly formed from loose \nearth,  eroded  granite,  and  clastic  rocks,  and  thus  are  vulnerable  to  geological  disasters \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 April 2007. \n ", "2   \nincluding collapse, landslides, and mud and debris floods. Many of these valleys are densely \npopulated and have been classified as areas prone to geological hazards. Another major natural \ndisaster that Wuzhou faces is floods. Guijiang and Xunjiang rivers bring with them more than \n85% of the total annual rainfall across the whole Guangxi, which flows by the city during the \nrainy season every summer. Historical data shows that the city was regularly flooded at an \naverage of once every 1.7 years between 1900 and 2006. Each time, the flooding resulted in \nhuman casualties and tremendous economic losses. \n \n4.  With support from the central and autonomous region governments, WMG has made \nhuge investments to strengthen disaster prevention and management over the past 50 years. \nMajor achievements include the construction of a flood protection dike along the riverbanks, \nnumerous  engineering  control  projects  to  stabilize  the  mountain  slopes,  and  building  and \nrebuilding of the landslide protection walls. These measures have played an important role in \ncombating  natural  disasters.  However,  some  traditional  control  and  prevention  measures, \nparticularly  the  repeated  building  of  landslide  protection  walls,  have  proven  to  be  an \nuneconomical and suboptimal solution to the geological hazard. People living in the geological \nhazard-prone valleys remain vulnerable to landslides despite the existence of a concrete wall. In \nJune  2006,  Wuzhou  was  hit  by  a  heavy  rain  that  triggered  a  number  of  landslides in  its \ndowntown area. This disaster alone took 14 lives and affected 640,000 people in Wuzhou and \nits surrounding counties. To strengthen urban sustainability and to provide the people with safer \nand more secure living conditions, Wuzhou needs to combat the flood and geological hazards in \na thorough and systematic manner. \n \n5.  Using lessons learned, WMG has proposed the project that represents a new strategy \nfor  disaster  management,  which  places  emphasis  on  prevention  and  avoidance  through \nintegrated  public  interventions  combining  efforts  for  disaster  prevention,  human  habitat \nimprovement, and urban development. The project will have the following major components: (i) \nbuilding  a  resettlement  community  and  evacuating  about  2,000  households  from \nPingmingchong valley, a high-risk landslide-prone valley; (ii) implementing engineering control \nmeasures  to  develop  the  evacuated  valley  into  a  piece  of  landslide-free  land  for  urban \nredevelopment; (iii) providing transport infrastructure including a bridge across Xunjiang/Xijiang \nRiver and the basic municipal infrastructure to enable the city to expand into new areas that are \nfar from zones prone to flood and geological hazards; and (iv) a new wastewater treatment plant \nto treat both the industrial and municipal wastewater generated in the fast-developing Wuzhou \nIndustrial Park, located upstream of Guijiang River, the source of drinking water for the city. The \ninitial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n6.  Promoting  inclusive  growth  in  the  interior  provinces  and  autonomous  regions  like \nGuangxi has been a major strategic thrust of ADB so as to address the regional imbalance in \nthe  PRC.  ADB  has  provided  several  loans  and  TAs  to  support  economic  development  in \nGuangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The first ADB-funded urban project in Guangxi is for \nNanning, the capital city of Guangxi\u2014the Guangxi Nanning Urban Environmental Upgrading \nProject,2 which is under smooth implementation. With the TA, WMG will, for the first time, work \nwith an international financial institution.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact of the TA will be reduced exposure to natural disasters and water pollution in \nWuzhou. It will be achieved through the design and implementation of an integrated public \nintervention combining efforts in three areas: disaster prevention, human habitat improvement, \nand urban development. The outcome of the TA will be a project design that is agreed upon by \nADB, the Government, and WMG, and will be suitable for ADB lending support. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The TA will engage international and national consultants to help the Government and \nWMG undertake the following major activities:  \n \n(i)  Sector  and  strategic  analysis. The consultants will make a comprehensive \nreview of the Wuzhou Urban Development Plan (2002\u20132020) and the Wuzhou \nGeological  Hazard  Prevention  and  Control  Master  Plan  (2007\u20132020)  in  the \ncontext of the 11th FYP and the national urbanization strategy. On the basis of \nthe review and taking into account national and international best practices, the \nconsultants will assess the rationale and justification of the project and give \nrecommendations for further strengthening the project design. \n \n(ii)  Economic  analysis.  The  consultants  will  review  the  draft  feasibility  study \nprepared by WMG for the project and undertake independent economic analysis \nof  the  project,  including  least-cost  analysis  and  affordability  analysis,  where \napplicable, to ensure that the economic analysis prepared for the project can fully \nmeet ADB processing requirements. \n \n(iii)  Financial  analysis.  The  consultants  will  review  the  draft  feasibility  study \nprepared by WMG and undertake an independent financial impact analysis to \nensure that the cost estimates, financing plan, and financial analysis prepared for \nthe project can fully meet ADB processing requirements. \n \n(iv)  Technical review. The consultants will review the technical design of all the \ncomponents under the project to make sure that they are technically sound, meet \nall the relevant technical standards and safeguard requirements, and are suitable \nfor ADB lending support. On the basis of the review, the consultants will make \nrecommendations for improving the technical design of each project component, \nconsidering best national or international practice. \n \n(v)  Poverty and social analysis. The consultants will help WMG engage a qualified \nsurvey institute to conduct the household survey for poverty and social analysis \nin accordance with the requirements of ADB. On the basis of the findings and \nrecommendations of the analysis, the consultants will give recommendations to \nfurther strengthen the development impact of the project. \n \n(vi)  Environmental  impact  assessment.  The  consultants  will  review  the \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) prepared for each project component \nand  make  sure  that  all  the  EIAs  meet  ADB  environmental  safeguard  policy \n ", "4   \nrequirements. Using the EIA review, the consultants will help prepare a summary \nEIA (SEIA) in the ADB required format and quality standards.  \n \n(vii)  Resettlement plan. The consultants will review the draft resettlement plan (RP) \nand help WMG engage a qualified survey institute to conduct survey and public \nconsultations,  and  improve  and  finalize  the  RP  in  accordance  with  ADB \nrequirements.  \n \n(viii)  Institutional review. The consultants will review the institutional arrangements \nproposed for the project and conduct a financial management assessment of the \nproject management office (PMO) and the implementing agencies to assess their \ncapability to implement the project. On the basis of the review and assessment, \nthe  consultant  will  give  recommendations  for  training  and  other  capacity \ndevelopment measures to strengthen the capacity to meet the needs of the \nproject.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $650,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB financing of $500,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit \nADB to finance any ensuing project. The Government will finance the balance of the TA costs, \nequivalent to $150,000, through in-kind contributions of office space and facilities, as well as \nsalaries for counterpart staff. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  WMG will be the Executing Agency of the TA. WMG has established a project leading \ngroup (PLG) to provide policy guidance in implementing the TA. The PLG is chaired by a deputy \nmayor with members drawn from the Wuzhou Development and Reform Commission, Wuzhou \nFinance Bureau, Wuzhou Construction and Planning Commission, Wuzhou Land Resources \nManagement Bureau, Wuzhou Environmental Protection Bureau, and Wuzhou Dongtai State \nAssets Investment and Management Corporation. Under the PLG, WMG has established a \nPMO to provide interagency coordination support for day-to-day operation of the TA. The TA will \nbe implemented over a period of about 8 months, starting from November 2007 and ending in \nJuly 2008. \n \n11.  The TA is expected to provide about 10.5 person-months of international consulting \nservices (person-months in parentheses) in the fields of urban development (3.5), economic \nanalysis (1.5), financial analysis (2.0), poverty and social safeguards (2.0), and environmental \nimpact assessment (1.5); and 23 person-months of national consulting services in the fields of \nurban development (2.0), economic analysis (2.5), financial analysis (2.0), poverty and social \nassessment  including  ethnic  minorities  (2.0),  resettlement  (3.0),  environmental  impact \nassessment  (2.5),  bridge  engineering  (2.0),  civil  engineering  (3.0),  industrial  wastewater \nmanagement (2.0), geological disaster management (1.0), and institutional analysis (1.0). The \noutline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  in  Appendix  4.  The  consultants  will  be \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time) using quality- and-cost based selection method at a quality-to-cost \nratio of 80:20 through biodata proposals.  \n \n ", "  5\n12.  The consultants are expected to submit the inception report at the end of the first month \nof fieldwork, and the interim report at the end of the fourth month of fieldwork. They are \nexpected to provide officials of the PMO and implementing agencies with initial training in ADB \nprocedural and operational requirements, and conduct workshops for participatory consultation \non  the  draft  documents.  Considering  the  comments  received  on  the  interim  report,  the \nconsultants will prepare the final report and submit the draft final report at the end of the sixth \nmonth of fieldwork. A Chinese translation of the report will be provided to the Government for its \nfile and easy reference. The TA will also provide limited office equipment for use during TA \nimplementation  (including  computers,  overhead  projector,  copy  machine,  printer,  facsimile \nmachine, scanner, etc.). The equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and will be handed over to the Government \nupon completion of the TA. \n \n13.  The TA deliverables will include the following project documents: feasibility study report, \nSEIA, and the RP. All these documents will be published on the ADB website for disclosure and \ndissemination. The outcome of the TA will be evaluated by both ADB and the Government in \naccordance with their respective evaluation policies and requirements. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n14.
