The technical assistance (TA) will support India in implementing the Inclusive, Resilient, \nand Sustainable Housing for Urban Poor Sector Project in Tamil Nadu, which is aligned with the \nfollowing impact: permanent shelter with appropriate housing infrastructure and services provided \nfor every affected household. The project will have the following outcome: access to inclusive and \nsafe  affordable  housing  infrastructure  and  services  for  vulnerable  and  disadvantaged \ncommunities in Tamil Nadu increased. The project\u2019s three outputs are (i) affordable and improved \nhousing for vulnerable communities constructed, (ii) affordable housing for urban poor and \nmigrant  workers  increased,  and  (iii)  regional  plan  development  supported.  The  project  is \nestimated to cost $215 million, of which $150 million will be financed from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources. The ensuing loan and this TRTA are listed under the country operations business plan \nfor India, 2021\u20132023.1   \n \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification  \n \n2.  Operation and maintenance. Ensuring appropriate operation and maintenance (O&M) is \na key value addition of the project in the delivery of affordable housing. For output 1, O&M \ncontracts will be implemented with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the project financing \nO&M during the loan implementation period (until 2028). The implementing agencies for outputs \n1  and  2\u2014Tamil  Nadu Slum  Clearance  Board (TNSCB)  for output  1,  and  the  Tamil  Nadu \nInfrastructure Fund Management Corporation (TNIFMC) for output 2\u2014have no experience in \ndeveloping comprehensive O&M contracts. Both implementing agencies require capacity support \nin the development of O&M contracts and modalities. In addition, improving TNSCB\u2019s asset \nmanagement capacity will contribute to better O&M of TNSCB assets.   \n \n3.  Required changes in affordable housing delivery. In addition to appropriate O&M, the \nproject will make gradual improvements in the delivery of affordable housing. While TNSCB has \nlong experience in building affordable housing to replace cleared slums, the project introduces \nimportant  changes  in  affordable  housing  design  and  delivery,  including  (i)  collection  and \nmanagement of beneficiary data, (ii) protection and restoration of cleared waterways, and (iii) \nimplementation of a graduation program for vulnerable households. The project will finance the \ndata collection, protection and restoration works, and the graduation program pilot, but technical \nexpertise is required to incorporate these new features into TNSCB\u2019s approach to implementing \naffordable housing. \n \n4.  During project preparation, surveys were conducted through a tablet-based data collection \nsystem supported by ADB to efficiently collect beneficiary data in addition to the standard \ndemographic data collected by TNSCB. Support is required to build TNSCB capacity in survey \nand data collection, and the use of statistical software for data analysis, and to improve data \nstorage.  \n \n5.  Securing  cleared  waterways  is  important  to  prevent  their  re-encroachment  by  slum \ndwellers.  In  addition,  once  cleared,  various  strategies  can  be  used  to  promote  ecological \nrestoration of the waterways. TNSCB requires support in developing restoration models for the \ncleared waterways. \n \n \n1   ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan. India, 2021\u20132023. Manila. \n ", "2 \n6.  The graduation approach is being piloted in subprojects to sustain vulnerable relocated \nhouseholds. The graduation approach is a holistic, time-bound, and carefully sequenced set of \ninterventions to help lift households from poverty. This includes four key components: (i) social \nassistance to support immediate needs, such as subsistence and health services during transition \nin  the  relocation  site;  (ii)  livelihood  promotion  through  localized  market  assessment  and \nhousehold-level enterprise and/or employment matching; (iii) financial inclusion through financial \nliteracy and improved access to savings and financial services to promote economic resilience; \nand (iv) social empowerment by improving social dynamics, including gender relations, in the \nfamilies and communities. During project preparation, ADB provided support for the design of the \ngraduation pilots and needed preparatory work. TNSCB requires further capacity building for its \nproject management unit (PMU) and project implementing unit (PIU) staff to implement this new \napproach to ensuring sustainable relocation. \n \n7.  Requirements for project implementation and future replication. TNSCB has not \nimplemented a recent ADB project; more importantly, the project is complex, with changes being \nintroduced that are non-standard. The PMU and PIU are well-staffed, with 145 positions, but \nspecialist support is required in specific areas of project management, supervision, and design. \nSupport is required in the form of specialist support to ensure compliant and timely subproject \npreparation and implementation. The PMU and PIU have environmental and social safeguards \nstaff, including specialized staff in the project implementation divisions in three different districts \nthat comprise the PIU. Similar to project management, safeguards capacity needs to be built \nthrough specialist support in the areas of environmental management, engineering, involuntary \nresettlement, social development, and gender. The specialist support is linked to the gradual \nchanges in the delivery of affordable housing (paras. 3\u20136). In addition, as the project is classified \nas Category A for resettlement, external monitoring is required. Safeguards capacity building will \nalso  be  provided to  TNIFMC.  Project  implementation  support  will  be  provided  to  all three \nimplementing agencies, with implementation guides developed that can be used for future \nreplication. \n \n8.   Financial management. The financial management risk is determined to be substantial.2 \nThe key mitigation measures to address the risk are: (i) establishing a nodal PMU in TNSCB to \ncoordinate and consolidate the financial information, (ii) filling vacant accounts staff positions \n(footnote 1), (iii) providing ongoing training in ADB\u2019s financial management requirements and \ndisbursement procedures, (iv) including comprehensive financial information in the quarterly \nproject progress reports to be submitted to ADB, and (v) adopting the use of accounting software \nby the PMU to record project transactions. Moreover, the project financial statements will be \naudited annually by an auditor acceptable to ADB, following auditing standards acceptable to \nADB. The three implementing agencies require support in implementing the agreed financial \nmanagement action (FMA) plan.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n9.  Output 1: Operations and maintenance of affordable housing assets improved. The \noutput will (i) review current O&M and successful practices in Tamil Nadu and other locations;              \n(ii) develop alternative O&M schemes in consultation with stakeholders; and (iii) develop O&M \ncontracts,  including  payment  mechanisms.  The  output  will  also  strengthen  TNSCB\u2019s  asset \n \n2  This is because (i) the complex financial management arrangements involve three implementing agencies, (ii) there \nare vacant accounts staff positions in TNSCB, (iii) there is a lack of experience with ADB\u2019s financial management \nrequirements and disbursement procedures on the part of implementing agencies, (iv) the Tamil Nadu Shelter Fund \nand TNIFMC have only recently been established and thus have limited financial track records, and (v) TNSCB and \nDTCP have no internal audit function in place and use manual accounting systems. \n ", "                   3 \nmanagement capacity by improving its asset management systems and practices. Good practices \nand  lessons  will  be  developed  into  knowledge  products\u2014including  model  O&M  contracts, \nguidelines for O&M of subprojects, and guidelines for asset management\u2014with associated \ntraining for both TNSCB and TNIFMC to build sustainability during implementation. While these \nknowledge products will guide implementation, these can also guide future replication. \n10.   Output 2: Institutional capacity of the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board, Tamil \nNadu Infrastructure Fund Management Corporation, and the Directorate of Town and \nCountry Planning to design and implement affordable housing delivery strengthened. Key \nactivities for TNSCB will include (i) support project and contract management, (ii) build capacity \nin conducting surveys and data analysis, (iii) build capacity in housing unit and complex design, \n(iv) develop models for restoration of cleared waterways, and (v) provide technical support for the \ngraduation approach pilots. For TNSCB and TNIFMC, support will be provided to implement and \nmonitor environmental and social safeguards. For TNIFMC, support will be provided for pipeline \ndevelopment of affordable housing subprojects. For the DTCP, support will be provided to build \ninstitutional  capacity,  planning,  and  development.  The  output  will  develop  manuals,  model \ndocuments and good practices, and knowledge products for the delivery of affordable housing. \nE-learning modules will be developed and used in training housing agencies and ULBs to guide \nimplementation and future replication. \n11.  Output 3: Financial management strengthened. The three implementing agencies will \nbe supported in implementing the agreed FMA plan. Key activities will be to support FMA \nimplementation,  including  training  in  ADB\u2019s  financial  management  requirements  and \ndisbursement procedures. The output will cover the initial year of project implementation to better \nensure sustainable financial management. The output will include guides for FMA for the three \nimplementing agencies.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n12.  The transaction TA is estimated to cost $1.65 million, of which $1.50 million will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \nThe key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of staff, office space and other in-kind contributions. The government was \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n13.   ADB will administer the TA. The Urban Development and Water Division of ADB\u2019s South \nAsia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants.  \n14.   The Government of Tamil Nadu through the Housing and Urban Development Department \nwill be the executing agency and TNSCB, TNIFMC, and DTCP will be the implementing agencies \nfor the TA, which will be implemented over 4 years.
