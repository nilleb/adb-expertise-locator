INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During  the  2008  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical \nassistance (TA) for Management and Policy Support to Combat Land Degradation.1 In May \n2009, an ADB mission visited the PRC and reached an understanding with the Government on \nthe  TA\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  implementation \narrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  PRC\u2013Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF)  Partnership  on  Land  Degradation  in \nDryland  Ecosystems  (the  Partnership)  was  initiated  in  2002  as  a  long-term  cooperation \nagreement between the PRC, the GEF, ADB, and other development partners to promote the \nintroduction  of  an  integrated  ecosystem  management  (IEM)  approach  to  combating  land \ndegradation in the PRC. Promoting environmental improvement by reversing natural resource \ndegradation is one of the strategic priorities in the country partnership strategy (2008\u20132010) of \nADB\u2019s operations in the PRC.2 The Partnership supports the principles of the PRC\u2019s 11th Five-\nYear Plan (2006\u20132010) to build a harmonious society, a new socialist countryside, and an \nefficient and environment-friendly society, and plays a key role in the efforts to improve dryland \necosystems and alleviate poverty in the PRC\u2019s western region, which is home to about 75% of \nthe PRC\u2019s rural poor. Poverty estimates illustrate the strong linkage between poverty incidence \nand areas suffering from land degradation. The Ministry of Agriculture estimates that loss of \nagricultural production because of land degradation is about 30% of the agricultural gross \ndomestic product, and undermines the potential for sustainable rural development in the PRC\u2019s \nwestern region. \n \n3.  Through the ADB and GEF-cofinanced Capacity Building to Combat Land Degradation \nProject,3 the State Forestry Administration (SFA) has effectively strengthened the Partnership \nand promoted the application of the IEM approach over the last few years. ADB\u2019s Capacity \nBuilding to Combat Land Degradation Project has (i) published several high-quality technical \nreports,  (ii) updated  laws  and  regulations  in  six  provinces,4  (iii)  prepared  provincial  land \ndegradation  strategies  and  action  plans,  (iv)  established  effective  institutional  cooperation \namong different sector agencies, (v) implemented a large number of IEM activities through 18 \npilot  sites,  (vi) established  provincial  data  centers,  and  (vii)  conducted  extensive  capacity \nbuilding and training programs. Moreover, investment projects have been prepared and are now \nbeing implemented. Despite significant achievements, lessons learned to enable scaling up of \ninvestments  include  the  need  to  (i)  strengthen  coordination  and  implementation  through \nassociated policy and institutional reforms; (ii) develop and pilot test innovative instruments to \nimprove sustainable land management (SLM); and (iii) seek further cooperation and integration \nwith  other  ongoing  programs  in  and  outside  the  PRC,  notably  with  the  United  Nations \nConvention  to  Combat  Desertification  and  the  PRC\u2013GEF  China  Biodiversity  Partnership \nFramework for closer collaboration during the design and implementation of related projects. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 5 August 2009. \n2  ADB. 2008.

The \nGovernment contributes $6.3 million equivalent.  \n4  Comprising Gansu Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Qinghai \nProvince, Shaanxi Province, and Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. \n ", "2   \n4.  The proposed TA is included in the Partnership\u2019s consolidated Program Framework \nDocument (PFD) for 2008\u201320105 prepared by the SFA with support from ADB, comprising about \n$600 million worth of investment and capacity building projects of ADB and other development \npartners  in  the  PRC,  such  as  the  World  Bank  and  the  International  Fund  for  Agricultural \nDevelopment. The PFD was approved by the GEF Council6 in April 2008. ADB is committed to \nremaining an active leader in implementing the Partnership\u2019s Framework Program.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The impact of the TA will be reduced land degradation in dryland ecosystems in the \nwestern region of the PRC through the introduction of innovative SLM practices for improved \nagriculture,  rangeland,  and  forest  management.  The  provinces  and  autonomous  regions \nincluded under the TA are Gansu Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Ningxia Hui \nAutonomous Region, Qinghai Province, Shaanxi Province, and Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous \nRegion. The outcome of the TA will be strengthened capacity of the PRC\u2013GEF Partnership to \naddress  and  manage  technical,  policy,  legal,  and  institutional  barriers  in  combating  land \ndegradation of the drylands of the PRC western region. The TA will further promote IEM to be \nmainstreamed  in  the  PRC\u2019s  development  policy  and  improve  SLM  practices  at  national, \nregional, and local levels; and enable scaling up of SLM investments that generate mutual \nbenefits for the global environment and local livelihoods.  \n \nB.

The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  TA implementation will take 36 months from January 2010 to December 2012, with the \nTA closing date of 30 June 2013. SFA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The TA will \nmake use of the comprehensive coordination structure established for the Partnership since \n2002 at both central and provincial levels.9 At the central level, a steering committee has been \nestablished that includes representatives from the national legislative and concerned ministries \nand agencies. A central project coordination office is established at the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF), headed by the director general of the Department of International Cooperation in MOF, \nwhile the CPMO established in SFA is headed by the deputy director general of the Department \nof Science and Technology in SFA. Through the CPMO, SFA will implement the TA and be \nresponsible for day-to-day operational matters concerning ADB, GEF consultants, and related \ngovernment  agencies.  SFA  will  provide  biannual  progress  reports  to  ADB  during  the  TA \nimplementation period and will furnish a TA completion report to ADB within 3 months of the TA \ncompletion date. Provincial project coordination offices and PPMOs have been set up in each of \nthe six participating provinces and autonomous regions, each headed by the vice governor or \nchair in charge of the agriculture sector. In addition, four specialized task forces have been \nestablished by the provinces to undertake project activities under the Partnership. \n \n17.  SFA will be supported by GEF-financed and ADB-financed international and national \nconsulting services. The GEF-financed consultants will comprise 936 person-months of full-time \nand 60 person-months of part-time experts at the CPMO and PPMOs. The GEF-financed \nconsultants will be engaged by the Executing Agency10 in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) using the individual selection \nmethod, which is considered appropriate and cost-effective given (i) the organizational structure \nis already established for the Partnership, and (ii) the participation of the six provinces in the TA. \nA financing agreement for the GEF grant will be prepared in accordance with the memorandum \nof understanding between ADB and the Secretariat of the GEF on Direct Access to GEF \nResources dated 4 July 2004. The ADB-financed consultants will comprise 8 person-months of \ninternational  and  8  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  ADB  will  carry  out  the \nrecruitment and supervision of the consultants to be financed through the ADB grant.

The review acknowledged the significant progress \nmade both at national and provincial levels in terms of capacity building and cross-sectoral coordination and \ncooperation. \n10 A procurement capacity assessment of SFA was conducted during the fact-finding mission using a capacity \nassessment questionnaire, interviews with key SFA and provincial staff, and visual inspections of physical facilities. \nIt was noted that SFA successfully implemented the Capacity Building to Combat Land Degradation Project (TA \n4357-PRC) since 2004. The Mission considers the SFA staff capable of handling the recruitment and supervision \nof consultants, and the administration of consultants' contracts. Notwithstanding, arrangements will be made for the \nkey  CPMO,  PPMO,  and  SFA  staff  to  attend  ADB  training  and  seminars  on  different  aspects  of  project \nimplementation. \n ", "6   \nand  conditions  of  the  Technical  Assistance  Framework  Agreement  executed  between  the \nGovernment  and  ADB  dated  23  December  1996  apply  to  the  ADB-financed  consultants. \nEquipment  to  be  purchased  under  the  TA  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), and their ownership will be \ntransferred to SFA upon TA completion. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3.  \n \n18.  The  proceeds  of  the  GEF  grant  will  be  disbursed  to  the  Government  by  ADB  in \naccordance with a memorandum of understanding between ADB and the GEF Secretariat; and \nthe terms and conditions set forth in the financial procedures agreement between ADB and the \nWorld Bank, as trustee of the GEF Trust Fund. For the proceeds of the GEF grant, an imprest \naccount shall be established by MOF at a bank acceptable to ADB. The account shall be \nmanaged and replenished in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as \namended from time to time). The initial amount to be deposited to the imprest account shall be \nbased on projected expenditures for the first 6 months of implementation or 10% of the TA \namount, whichever is lower. MOF will disburse the proceeds of the GEF grant to the CPMO and \nthe six provinces in accordance with the consolidated annual work and financial plans of the \nCPMO and the six provinces. The CPMO will be responsible for consolidating and submitting \nthe annual work and financial plans to MOF. The statement of expenditures procedures may be \nused for reimbursement of eligible expenditures financed out of the GEF grant, and also for \nreplenishing and liquidating advances that were deposited to the imprest account. Any individual \npayment to be reimbursed under the statement of expenditures procedure shall not exceed \n$50,000 equivalent.  \n \n19.  For the withdrawal of the GEF grant, SFA will submit to ADB the original withdrawal \napplication, signed by authorized representatives of MOF and SFA, summary sheet, and copies \nof supporting documents. SFA will maintain separate accounts for the GEF grant and have \nthese accounts audited on an annual basis by an external auditor acceptable to ADB. Within \n6 months after the end of the fiscal year, SFA will submit to ADB and MOF a consolidated audit \nreport covering the CPMO and the six provinces. SFA will also include in the TA progress report \nthe status of GEF grant utilization during the report period and utilization cumulative from the \nstart of implementation. SFA will retain the original supporting documents for expenditures \nunder the TA for 5 years after TA completion, and make these documents available to the ADB \nreview mission upon request within the indicated TA retention period. SFA has experience in \nimplementing ADB TA projects and has an adequate accounting and recording system in place.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n \n20.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,727,455 to the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for Management and Policy Support to Combat Land Degradation, \nto be financed on a grant basis by the Global Environment Facility. If the Board approves ADB \nadministering the technical assistance, the President, acting under the authority delegated by \nthe Board, will approve ADB providing the balance of the technical assistance not exceeding the \nequivalent of $200,000, for Management and Policy Support to Combat Land Degradation.
