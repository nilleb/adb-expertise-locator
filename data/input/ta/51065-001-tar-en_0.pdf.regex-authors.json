THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \nA.  Justification \n1.  The proposed transaction TA facility will provide project preparation and policy advice \nsupport to a series of ensuing projects, comprising: (i) Solomon Islands Guadalcanal Road \nRehabilitation Project, (ii) Tonga Fanga\u2019uta Lagoon Crossing Project, and (iii) an investment \nproposal in Vanuatu. All ensuing projects will improve domestic transport connectivity in the \ncountries being covered. The proposed transaction TA will also provide advisory support to the \nGovernment of Vanuatu to formulate a national transport sector investment policy and plan. \n \n2.  The Pacific island countries of Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu (target countries) \nshare similar characteristics. By regional standards, they are mid-range in terms of size and \npopulation. They are significantly smaller in size and population than the larger Pacific countries \nsuch as Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste, and Fiji, although larger than the micro states of Tuvalu \nand Nauru. Tonga\u2019s population is about 100,000, Solomon Islands\u2019 population is about 600,000, \nand Vanuatu\u2019s population is about 250,000. The target countries are geographically isolated and \nfar from main commercial centers. Tonga is located about 2,000 km from New Zealand and 3,000 \nkm from Australia, while Solomon Islands and Vanuatu are located about 2,000 km from both \nAustralia and New Zealand.  \n \n3.  Domestic transport connectivity in the target countries mostly depends upon roads and \ninterisland shipping. These modes of transport are critical to provide essential services, improve \ntrade and tourism, and access to domestic and international markets.  Road transport is an \nimportant subsector, especially on larger islands where the road network provides access to key \neconomic  links  such  as  tourism  and  agriculture.  Roads  also  provide  access  to  essential \ngovernment services including health and education. They also serve as an important intermodal \nlink, providing access to ports and airports, thereby facilitating the movement of people and goods \nfor inter and intra-island travel. \n \n4.  To achieve the full intended service life and level of service of transport infrastructure \nassets,  proactive  routine  and  periodic  road  needs  to  be  prioritized  through  sound  asset \nmanagement systems, especially where natural disasters and/or high intensity rainfall can quickly \nexacerbate the poor condition of the road. Road conditions can also be undermined by the \nmovement  of  overloaded  vehicles  from  forestry,  agriculture,  construction,  and  other  heavy \nindustries. The main constraints to the delivery of efficient transport infrastructure and services \nare hampered by characteristics shared by the target countries, including (i) insufficient capacity \nof institutions responsible for infrastructure delivery to implement sustainable routine and periodic \nmaintenance programs, (ii) inadequate fiscal budgets to allocate required financial resources for \nrecurrent maintenance and rehabilitation,  (iii) vulnerability to natural disasters and anticipated \nclimate change, and (iv) limited transport sector policy and legislation.  \n \n5.  Due to these systemic issues, a large proportion of the road networks in the three target \ncountries is poor as they have exceeded their lifecycle and have been neglected. Poor road \nconditions increase the time for road users to travel and the cost to operate their vehicles. Poor \nroad conditions also lead to an increase in road crashes, which results in significant economic \nlosses.  Insufficient  road  safety  furniture,  poor  driving  behavior,  and  a  lack  of  road  safety \nawareness of vehicle occupants, pedestrians, and other road users are further factors that \nconstrain the safe movement of passengers and goods in the target countries. \n  \n ", "2 \n6.  The proposed transaction TA facility will provide the governments of Solomon Islands, and \nVanuatu  preparatory  support  for  projects  that  will  improve  domestic  connectivity  through \ninvestments targeted at rehabilitating or upgrading existing infrastructure assets. The proposed \ntransaction TA facility will provide preparatory support for a new capital project in Tonga to \nimprove the road network redundancy.   \n \n7.  Solomon Islands. The Ministry of Infrastructure Development (MID) manages national \nland and non-commercial maritime transport infrastructure in Solomon Islands. Land transport is \nthe country\u2019s second dominant mode of transport, after maritime, and the road network is 1,875 \nkm long, of which only 6% is sealed and the rest unsealed. Investments in transport infrastructure \nare prioritized through the 30 year National Transport Plan (NTP), from which a Medium-term \nTransport Action Plan (MTTAP) is formulated and prioritizes investment needs over 2017-2021. \nThe MTTAP estimates financing required for some 48 priority projects in the land and maritime \nsubsectors estimated at SI$775 million or $104 million equivalent.  From these priorities, there is \na financing gap of SI$185 million or about $24 million equivalent.  The Government of Solomon \nIslands has requested ADB\u2019s support to prepare feasibility studies to upgrade 12 km and \nrehabilitate 68 km of roads on Guadalcanal, which provides essential access to the national \ncapital, Honiara. The roads selected are priorities under the MTTAP and part of the financing gap. \n \n8.   Vanuatu.  The Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities (MIPU) is responsible for the \nmanagement of national transport infrastructure which includes 22 public ports and jetties, and \nthe 2,223 km long public road network. National transport infrastructure has deteriorated due to \na lack of maintenance. In 2017, the budget allocated for transport infrastructure maintenance is \nVatu 1,200 million or about $11 million equivalent, which is about half of the project annual \nmaintenance needs estimated at Vatu 2,200 million or $20 million equivalent. The deteriorated \ncondition of infrastructure has been further exacerbated by damage caused by Tropical Cyclone \nPam, which struck Vanuatu in May 2015. The government in 2015 endorsed the Vanuatu \nInfrastructure Strategic Investment Plan (VISIP) which covers all infrastructure sectors. The VISIP \nidentifies the need for an integrated transport sector plan to articulate national transport sector \npolicy and prioritize infrastructure emergency works, maintenance, rehabilitation, upgrading, and \nnew development.  \n \n9.   The Government of Vanuatu has requested ADB to support the formulation of a national \ntransport sector plan, focusing on (i) transport infrastructure planning and asset management, (ii) \nsources and allocation of recurrent maintenance financing, (iii) institutional capacity of transport \nline agencies, and (iv) a roadmap for policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms on relevant areas \nsuch as road safety, weight limits, and climate change adaptation. In addition, the VISIP has \nidentified South Santo Road as a priority project, for which feasibility studies are needed and \ncould be supported under the proposed transaction TA facility. \n \n10.  Tonga. The capital, Nuku\u2019alofa, situated on the main island Tongatapu, is located on a \nlow-lying area in a region that is vulnerable to natural disasters, including floods and tsunamis. \nThe Taufa\u2019ahau corridor is the main transport link into and out of Nuku\u2019alofa during peak hour \ntravel times. The Government of Tonga has requested ADB\u2019s support to evaluate and prepare \nfeasibility studies for a new transport link featuring a bridge or crossing from Nuku\u2019alofa to \nsouthern Tongatapu, across Fanga\u2019uta lagoon. The new link would span about 500 meters across \nthe shortest route over the lagoon, and would provide (i) shorter journeys to the capital for people \nliving in central and eastern parts of Tongatapu, resulting in savings for travel time and vehicle \noperating costs, and (ii) a high capacity link out of Nuku\u2019alofa that could be used as an evacuation \nroute to higher areas in the event of a tsunami. In evaluating such a proposal, it should be \ncompared against other viable alternatives, such as providing an evacuation route through the \n ", "3 \nexisting Taufa\u2019ahau corridor with effective traffic and evacuation management and/or upgrading \nits existing capacity.  \n \n11.  The proposed transaction TA facility is listed in the current Regional Operations Business \nPlan (ROBP).1 The proposed transaction TA facility will support priorities in the Pacific Approach2 \nby preparing new transport infrastructure investments that (i) are resilient to anticipated climate \nchange and natural disaster impacts, and (ii) will improve domestic and regional connectivity, \nthereby enhancing access to business opportunities and social services. The TA is categorized \nas complex, as the ensuing project for Tonga is anticipated to be environment category A.    \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n12.  The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table 1.  \n \nTable 1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nMajor Outputs  Delivery Dates  Key Activities with Milestones \n1.

Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $2,000,000, all of which will be provided by ADB on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 1. \n \n14.  The governments of Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu will provide counterpart \nsupport  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office  supplies,  domestic \ntransportation, and other in-kind contributions. The governments were informed that approval of \nthe TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, with the Pacific Department as the focal point \nfor  the  TA.  The  implementing  agencies  in  the  participating  countries  will  be  Ministry  of \nInfrastructure, Land Transport Department (MOI-LTD) in Tonga, MID in Solomon Islands and \nMIPU in Vanuatu.  \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  June 2017\u2013June 2019 \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank \nImplementing agencies  Ministry of Infrastructure, Land Transport Department, Tonga \nMinistry of Infrastructure Development, Solomon Islands \nMinistry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities, Vanuatu \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Individual Consultant  11 person-months  $300,000 \nSelection \n  Quality and Cost  52 person-months  $1,500,000 \nBased Selection \n(90:10) \n ", "5 \nAspects   Arrangements \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting will be administered for the Transport Policy and \nPlanning Specialist through individual consultant selection, and for the \nProject Preparation Firm through quality and cost based selection. \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Fixed assets will be handed over to the respective government in each \narrangement upon TA completion  country upon TA completion. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n16.  Consulting services. The TA will require 2 consulting assignments. The first assignment \nto develop a National Transport Sector Strategy and Plan for Vanuatu will require an individual \nTransport Policy and Planning Specialist and individual Maritime Specialist consisting of 11 \ninternational  person-months  (pm).  The  individual  will  be  selected  by  ADB  using  Individual \nConsultant Selection, and will use an input-based contract with liquidation of advance. The \nsecond assignment to primarily identify and prepare investment proposals in the three target \ncountries will require a consulting firm requiring as a minimum the following international expertise: \nTeam  Leader/Transport  Planner/Economist  (12  person-months),  Financial  Analyst/Financial \nManagement Specialist (4 person-months), Social Safeguards Specialist (8 person-months), \nEnvironment Specialist (8 person-months), Climate and Disaster Risk Specialist (3 person-\nmonths),  Roads  Engineer  (6  person-months),  Roads  Safety  Engineer  (2  person-months), \nStructural Engineer (6 person-months), Procurement Specialist (3 person-months), and Social \nand Poverty Specialist (4 person-months). The consultant firm will be selected by ADB using \nquality and cost-based selection (90:10), and will use an output-based, lump sum contract with \nprovision of fixed out-of-pocket expenditures. Selection of consultants will commence in June \n2017, with mobilization of individual consultant targeted by July 2017 and mobilization of the firm \ntargeted by September 2017. Inputs are indicative and may be realigned to the TA\u2019s requirements. \nThe consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).3 \n \nE.  Governance  \n \n17.  Since ADB is the executing agency, the financial management, procurement, and integrity \nrisks during TA implementation are assessed to be low. However, thorough risk assessments for \nfinancial management, procurement, and integrity for ensuing investment projects implemented \nin any of the target countries will be conducted under the TA. \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu, for Strengthening Domestic Transport Connectivity in \nthe Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \nJune 2017 \n                                                \n3  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n \nItem  Amount \nA.
