The project preparatory technical assistance (TA) is required to assist in the design of \nthe proposed Social Protection Development Project (the project). This TA will be used to \nprepare the necessary assessments, assist with all necessary due diligence tasks, and to \ndevelop detailed project activities. In addition, in view of emerging fiscal pressures in Pakistan, \nthere might be a need for ADB to be prepared to step up its assistance to BISP and in that way \nring-fence  \u2013  to  the  extent  possible  \u2013  the  benefits  to  the  extreme  poor  from  eventual \nmacroeconomic disruptions.  \n \nB.   Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.  The five main outputs of the TA will be:  \n \n(i)  Survey report of BISP\u2019s operations. Under the AETP Subprogram 2, $150 million \nwas  earmarked  for  BISP  in  support  of  beneficiaries  identified  under  the  new \nscorecard  targeting  method.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  transferred  the  equivalent \namount in Pakistan rupees to BISP. BISP used the amount for the payment of cash \ntransfers to beneficiaries under the new targeting method. The TA will support a \nthird-party validation to assess whether the cash payments from BISP have reached \nthe intended beneficiaries. At the same time, the survey will collect the response of \nthe beneficiaries on recent key changes in BISP\u2019s operations.  \n \n(ii)  Project design to roll out the registration for the cash transfer program to \nremaining eligible beneficiaries - Under the poverty scorecard survey, 7.2 million \nfamilies have been declared eligible, of which 2.78 million (39%) eligible families \neither do not have a female head with CNIC12, or have not reported the CNIC of the \nfemale  member  to  the  survey  team.  The  project  will  help  address  the  issues \nimpeding the issuance of CNICs to women eligible under the cash transfer program. \nThe TA will assist in preparing this support. \n \n(iii)  Project design(s) to introduce and roll out (a) vocational training, (b) health \ninsurance,  and/or  (c)  CCT  for  health  program  providing  access  to \nimmunization and micronutrients for children and pregnant women - The TA \nwill  review  the  vocational  training  program  (waseela-e-rozgar)  and  the  health \ninsurance  program  (waseela-e-sehat),  assess  the  soundness  of  design  and \nimplementation,  and  prepare  alternative  designs,  including  the  operational \nrequirements to support the piloting and gradual roll out of the program over the \nproject period. The TA will also prepare the design of a CCT for health program, \nlinked to immunization and micronutrients for pregnant women and children under 2 \nyears. It will assist in determining the interventions to be supported under the CCT \nprogram, in setting the appropriate amount, in determining entry and exit rules, and \nin  identifying  the  required  support  for  service  delivery.  In  addition,  the  TA  will \nestimate the cost of each program for the project period, and assess which program \nwill have the biggest impact possible for the least cost. \n \n                                                \n12 The possession of CNIC by female applicant/recipient is one of the eligibility criteria for the cash transfer. \n ", "2   \n(iv)  Project design for interventions to improve BISP administration - The TA will \nsupport  financial  management  and  governance  assessment  of  the  BISP.  It  will \nidentify required operational improvements in the targeting, verification, payment \nsystem and grievance redressal system of the BISP, and specify the procurement \nand consulting services requirements. It will support the monitoring and evaluation \n(M&E)  unit  of the  BISP  in  the  preparation  of M&E  tools for  the  roll out  of  the \ngraduation program(s) to be implemented under the project. \n \n(v)  Preparation for a possible programmatic engagement - The TA will review and \nidentify  policy  and  institutional  deficiencies  in  the  current  federal  and  provincial \nframework of social protection in Pakistan. This will include analyzing the problems \nof coordination between BISP and provincial governments, and ensure failures in \ntargeting  are  kept  to  a  minimum  in  the  transition  stages  of  the  process  of \nimplementation  of  the  18th  amendment.  The  dialogue  between  BISP  and  the \ndifferent levels of sub-national Government will also be supported under this TA. \n \n3.  Based on the work above, the TA will prepare a project document, following the formats \nand templates required by ADB. This will include the definition and development of performance \ntargets and indicators; drafting summaries of external assistance to the sector and of lessons \nlearned;  assisting  in  developing  the  design  and  monitoring  framework;  project  outputs \ndescription;  detailed  project  cost  estimates;  implementation  arrangements  and  schedule; \nindicative procurement packaging and draft procurement plans; staffing; terms of reference for \nconsulting services; describe project impacts benefits and risks; and a project performance \nmonitoring system. \n \n4.

The TA will require 12 person-months of international consultants, 19 person-months of \nnational consultants and the services of a firm for a third party validation survey.
