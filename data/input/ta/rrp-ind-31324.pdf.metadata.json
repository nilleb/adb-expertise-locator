Subborrowers will be state electricity boards (SEBs) \nand  other  state-level  power  utilities  that  have  given  a  firm \ncommitment to PFC on undertaking power sector reforms. The \nAsian Development Bank  (ADB) will provide loan assistance to \nthe selected subborrowers, through PFC, to meet part of their \nfinancing  requirements  for  reducing  system  losses,  enhancing \noperational flexibility and efficiency, and improving the delivery of \nservices to consumers. The borrowing limit, at any given time, is \nlinked to the reform milestone corresponding to that stage of the \nagreed reform process. \n \n  The subprojects will consist of (i) transmission and distribution \nrehabilitation, (ii) transmission and distribution facilities required \nfor system expansion and reinforcement, and (iii) renovation and \nmodernization of existing generating plants. \n \nRationale  It  is  being  recognized  that  comprehensive  sector  reforms  are \nneeded to improve the performance of India's power sector. ADB \nhas already initiated such reforms in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh \nand is in the process of doing so in Kerala. Considering that there \nare 29 states and 6 union territories, most of which are in need of \nadvice and assistance to undertake reforms, it is necessary to \ncomplement the ongoing efforts by focusing on more states. \n \nPFC,  which  started  lending  to  the  power  sector  in  1988  and \ncommenced promoting reforms in 1996, is heavily involved with \nstate-level power utilities. Based on its previous performance, and \nstaff skills and experience, PFC appears to be the best agent to \npromote  state-level  power  sector  reforms.  The  proposed  loan \naims to utilize PFC's experience and expertise in reform-oriented \nlending,  thereby  supplementing  ADB's  own  staff  and  financial \nresources. Lending through PFC will allow ADB to facilitate sector \nreforms in more utilities than would otherwise be possible. The \nproposed loan is also in synergy with the Government\u2019s efforts in \npromoting power sector reforms through mechanisms such as the \nAccelerated Power Development and Reform Program. \n   ", "ii   \nObjectives  The overall objective of the ADB assistance is to help improve the \nstate power sector in India so that it becomes financially self-\nsustaining  and  capable  of  adequately  providing  its  share  of \nservices to the country's economic and social development. The \nimmediate objectives are to (i) promote power sector reforms in a \nfew  selected  states;  (ii) help  establish  independent  regulatory \nbodies; and (iii) functionally unbundle the sector entities so that \nthey  become  commercially  and  operationally  autonomous  and \nefficient, and financially viable. To help achieve these objectives, \nADB will provide financial assistance, channeled through PFC, to \nthe selected SEBs to meet part of their financing requirements \nneeded to reduce system losses, enhance operational flexibility \nand efficiency, and improve the delivery of services to consumers. \n         \nFinancing Plan  ADB will finance 60% of the total subproject cost. The remaining \nfunds will come from the subborrowers\u2019 own resources, which \nmay include further PFC loans. The maximum lending for any \nsingle subborrower will be 40% of the total ADB loan unless \notherwise agreed by ADB. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $150 million from ADB's ordinary capital resources will \nbe provided under ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility. The loan \nwill have a 20-year term including a grace period of 5 years, with \nrepayments linked to actual disbursements under the Loan, an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB's LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a \nfront-end fee of 1.0%, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft Loan Agreement. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  PFC will relend ADB funds in accordance with individual reform-\nTerms  oriented operational and financial action plans (R-OFAPs) agreed \nwith  the  eligible  subborrowers,  and  PFC's  Operational  Policy \nStatement. The subloans will have a maximum maturity period of \n15 years, including a grace period not exceeding 5 years.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2008. \n   \nEstimated Project   \nCompletion Date  31 December 2007 \n   ", "  iii \nImplementation  PFC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  proposed  loan.  Its \nArrangements  chairperson and managing director will be responsible for the \noverall management of the Project. Day-to-day implementation of \nthe Project will be carried out by the relevant divisions under \nguidance from their respective directors as follows: formulation of \nand  obtaining  approval  for  R-OFAPs,  determining  maximum \nlending  limits  for  R-OFAP  milestones,  and  monitoring  of  their \ncompliance will be the responsibility of the Institutional Appraisal \nand Development Division; appraisal and approval of subprojects \nand  monitoring  of  their  implementation,  including  procurement \nactivities, will be the responsibility of the Projects Division. The \nEnvironmental Assessment and Monitoring Cell in the Externally \nAided  Projects  Unit  will  be  responsible  for  environmental  and \nsocial  assessment  of  subprojects  and  the  monitoring  of  their \nenvironmental  and  social  impact  mitigation  measures. \nCoordination of all project-related matters between ADB and PFC \nwill be the responsibility of the Externally Aided Projects Unit. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Power Finance Corporation Limited \n   \nProcurement  Procurement for goods and services financed under the ADB loan \nwill follow ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. For contracts valued \nat  $5 million  or  more,  subborrowers  will  follow  international \ncompetitive bidding procedures. For contracts below $5 million, \nPFC will ensure that competitive and transparent procedures will \nbe followed by subborrowers. \n \n  Procurement will be from ADB member countries only. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The financial health of many SEBs has been deteriorating due to \nBeneficiaries  insufficient cost recovery, inadequate tariffs, and high operating \ncosts.  Consequently,  most  of  the  SEBs  are  now  being \nrestructured under various initiatives to achieve financial viability \nand improve operational efficiency. The proposed loan will be \nused to support these reform-minded SEBs. The subprojects to be \nfinanced  under  the  proposed  loan  will  contribute  to  financial \nrecovery  through  increased  efficiency,  lower  transmission  and \ndistribution losses, and better metering and collections. These \nimprovements are expected to improve the financial condition of \nthe  assisted  agencies  and  will  lead  to  improved  delivery  of \nservices to the final consumers. \n   \nThe indirect benefits attributable to the proposed loan are also \nsubstantial.  For  example,  tariff  rationalization  by  independent \nregulatory bodies will result in more equitable tariff levels across \nconsumer categories, leading to efficient allocation of financial \nand economic resources. Improvements in the quality of power \nsupply will enhance agricultural production and will discourage the \n   ", "iv   \n  use of inefficient captive power generation by agricultural and \ncertain  industrial  consumers.  Finally,  the  tariff  decisions  by \nindependent regulatory bodies and a stable power supply, through \nsystem  improvements,  will  encourage  more  private  sector \nparticipation both in the power sector and in other parts of the \neconomy. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The main risk is the financial viability of SEBs and hence of PFC. \nPFC\u2019s asset quality is vulnerable to the poor creditworthiness of \nits SEB clients. PFC has attempted to mitigate this credit risk by \nsecuring its loans though escrow account arrangements and state \ngovernment  guarantees.  Escrow  account  arrangements  cover \n1.25 times the present and future debt service of SEBs owing \nmoney  to  PFC.  To  further  minimize  this  risk,  PFC  will  select \nsubborrowers based strictly on the proposed R-OFAP mechanism \nand ensure timely risk control management. These efforts are \nexpected to minimize the associated risks. \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Power Finance Corporation Limited (PFC), for the State Power Sector Reform Project1. \nThe loan will be guaranteed by India. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Performance2 \n1.  The Power Sector Setup \n2.  The Ministry of Power of the Government of India (the Government) provides overall \nguidance to the sector. The recently established Central Electricity Regulatory Commission is \nempowered to regulate the sector  at the national level, including central power utilities in \naccordance with the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, 1998. The central power utilities \ninclude the National Thermal Power Corporation, National Hydroelectric Power Corporation, and \nNuclear Power Corporation, which are engaged in generation, and the Powergrid Corporation, \nwhich  is  engaged  in  interstate  power  transmission.  The  Government  also  owns  financing \ninstitutions devoted solely to power sector lending such as PFC and the Rural Electrification \nCorporation.  Recently,  the  Government  established  the  Power  Trading  Corporation,  to  be \nresponsible for power trading among states and between states and central power utilities. \n \n3.  At the state level, the state governments control the sector through state electricity \nboards (SEBs)3 and  electricity departments (EDs). These SEBs and EDs are responsible for \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution, usually within their own states and territories. The \ncentral power utilities own and operate 30% of the country's total generation capacity, while \nSEBs and EDs have 59% of the total. In addition, five privately owned utilities, operating in \ncertain urban centers and responsible for power distribution within their franchised areas, \ntogether with some independent power producers, have a share of 11% of generation. \n \n2.  Sector Performance \n4.  The objectives that have been set for the power sector in the Government's recent five-\nyear plans have not been fully met. The main objective of the most recent plans was to ensure \nthat the anticipated demand for electricity was met adequately and in a reliable and cost-\neffective manner. Power sector performance, measured using this objective as the yardstick, \nhas not been satisfactory. \n \na.  Technical Performance \n5.  In terms of capacity addition, the performance during the Eighth Plan (FY1993\u20131997) \nwas only 54% of target, having added only 16,422 megawatts (MW) instead of the targeted \n30,538 MW. The Ninth Plan envisaged a total addition of 40,245 MW during the FY1998\u20132002 \nperiod, comprising 11,909 MW by central sector agencies, 10,748 MW by state utilities, and \n17,588 MW by the private sector independent power producers (IPPs). However, the actual \ncapacity addition fell far short of target, with the central sector meeting only 37.8% and the \nprivate sector 28.8% of target. The state sector performed better, achieving 87.9% of target. \nGiven the SEBs\u2019 difficulties associated with establishing adequate escrow accounts to service \n                                                 \n1    The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Appendix 2 gives a detailed description and analysis of the sector. \n3   Seven out of these SEBs have been restructured into separate generation, transmission, and distribution entities. ", "2 \npower purchase contracts and the attendant problems in achieving financial closure for IPP \nprojects currently in India, realizing the full IPP contribution to the generation addition appears to \nbe unlikely in the immediate future.  \n \n6.  While new generation addition has fallen short of target, the existing generating plants, \nmainly coal-fired thermal power plants, have shown improved performance during the recent \npast.  With  the  renovation  and  modernization  (R&M)  program  for  thermal  power  stations, \nintroduced in the early 1990s, the plant load factor4\u2014a performance indictor\u2014has increased \nfrom 64.4% in FY1997 to 69.9% in FY2002. According to the Common Minimum National Action \nPlan (para. 10), the overall plant load factor was expected to increase to a minimum of 65% for \nstate-owned utilities and to a national average of 70% by 2002. However, given the substantial \nshortage in capacity addition, these improvements in the performance of existing generating \nplants are inadequate to narrow down the demand-supply gap. Although, by the end of FY2002, \nIndia had a total installed capacity of 105,000 MW, there was a peak power deficit of 12.6% and \nan energy deficit of 7.5%. Per capita electricity consumption stood at 355 kilowatt-hours (kWh) \nin FY2002, compared to, for example, 719 kWh for the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n \n7.  Operational performance, measured in terms of transmission and distribution (T&D) \nlosses, has also not been satisfactory. T&D losses are reported to have increased from 24.5% \nin FY1997 to 27.8% in FY2002 for the entire country. In the absence of adequate metering \narrangements, especially for agricultural consumers, part of the losses used to be lumped \ntogether with agricultural consumption. The actual losses are, therefore, thought to be much \nhigher, with some SEBs now reporting T&D losses as high as 45\u201357%.5 The major reasons for \nsuch high losses are pilferage of energy through unauthorized connections and tampering of \nmeters, and technical losses originating from overloaded distribution networks. \n \nb.  Financial Performance \n8.  Since the SEBs account for almost 80% of commercial electricity sales in the country, \nthe financial performance of the entire sector, including that of central sector agencies, is \nheavily dependent on the performance of the SEBs. Under the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948, \namended in 1984, the financial performance of the SEBs used to be measured in terms of rate \nof return (ROR) on net fixed assets with a mandated minimum ROR of 3%. However, none of \nthe SEBs achieved this mandated minimum without a subsidy from their state government, and \nonly Karnataka achieved a 3% ROR with the government subsidy. All the others posted \nnegative RORs. As indicated in Table 1 below, the consolidated performance of all SEBs shows \nthat the minimum required value has not been achieved during the recent past, and indeed, \ndeteriorated  over  the  period  indicated.  The  major  reasons  for  this  unsatisfactory  financial \nperformance were the increasing gap between the cost of supply and the average tariff, and the \ndecreasing recovery rate. These figures stood at Rs1.10 per kWh and 68.6%, respectively, in \nFY2002. \n                                                 \n4   Defined as the ratio of actual capacity utilization of the plant to its rated capacity utilization. \n5   For example, T&D losses for Delhi are reported to be 57%.

Planning Commission.  \n \n9.  The poor financial performance of the SEBs and the resulting shortage of liquidity has \nalso adversely affected their operational efficiency and led to increasing T&D losses. With the \nlimited financial resources available, the tendency of most of the SEBs had been to invest a \nlarger proportion in generation to address the demand-supply gap and less in transmission and \ndistribution. Over the years, this approach has led to inadequate distribution facilities resulting in \noverloading, inadequate maintenance, high T&D losses, and poor supply reliability, which in turn \nled to insufficient revenue\u2014thus resulting in a vicious circle. \n \nB.  Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Structural Weaknesses of the Sector and Government Strategy \n10.  The  main  reason  for  the  overall  unsatisfactory  performance  of  the  sector  can  be \nattributed to structural weaknesses. For more than half a century, the Indian Electricity Act of \n1910 and the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948 provided the basic framework for power sector \noperations. They provided for the establishment of SEBs, EDs, and central sector utilities and \ncontributed to the current status of development of the sector serving a population of more than \n1 billion. However, with the worldwide changes in economic and financial imperatives and \ntechnological developments, the sector needed comprehensive reforms to provide the flexibility \nrequired to meet the challenges that lay ahead. These challenges included achieving financial \nautonomy and viability, good governance, attracting private sector investment, and finally, \nproviding a good quality supply to an increasingly demanding population. The Government's \ninitial  approach  to  address these issues was not comprehensive enough. For example, to \npromote private sector participation in generation projects, the Government, in 1991, amended \ncertain parts of the Electricity Act, 1910 to facilitate mobilization of domestic and foreign private \nfunds and to allow incentives such as high returns on investments. Although there was some \ninitial enthusiasm from the private sector, these measures have not resulted in more than 6,800 \nMW of capacity addition so far. The poor financial performance of the SEBs did not provide \nsufficient comfort to potential investors. In 1993, as a result of efforts made by the National \nDevelopment Council,6 a high-level committee on power was constituted. In its report, submitted \nin October 1994, the committee recommended (i) organizational reforms at the state level aimed \nat  unbundling  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  operations  of  SEBs  and \ncommercialization of the ensuing entities; (ii) organizational reforms at the national and regional \nlevels  aimed  at  freeing  the  central  sector  agencies  from  tight  government  control  and  at \nreducing the Government's equity in these agencies so as to enable participation of the private \n                                                 \n6   The National Development Council is India's highest political body comprising the chief ministers of all the states \nin India, and chaired by the Prime Minister. ", "4 \nsector on a joint-venture basis; (iii) large-scale involvement of the private sector in generation \nand  transmission,  with  sponsors  selected  through  transparent  and  competitive  bidding \nprocedures; (iv) creation of national and regional tariff boards to take over the responsibility for \ntariff  setting  independently  of  central  government  and  state  government  control;  and \n(v) progressive phasing out of subsidies to agricultural consumers. These recommendations \nultimately led to the adoption by the National Development Council of a Common Minimum \nNational Action Plan for Power in 1996. To operationalize some of the recommendations, the \nElectricity Regulatory Commissions Act was passed in 1998 enabling the establishment of \nindependent regulatory bodies at the central and state levels. Although this was a significant \nstep toward improving the sector, it was not comprehensive enough to cover complete sector \nrestructuring. The Government set up the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission under the \nAct, to be responsible for regulating power sector operations at the national level, related to \ngeneration and interstate transmission. The state governments were given the option to set up \ntheir own state electricity regulatory commissions (SERCs) under the Act or under bills to be \npassed by their own legislative assemblies. As a result of these initiatives and sometimes on \ntheir own, some states have taken steps to reform their power sectors. Foremost among them \nwas Orissa, which, with World Bank assistance, completely unbundled its SEB and established \nthe  country's  first  SERC  in  1996.  Reforms  in  Orissa  were  followed  by  similar  reforms  in \nHaryana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh with World Bank assistance and in \nGujarat and Madhya Pradesh with ADB assistance. \n \n11.  To promote more comprehensive reforms in the power sector, the Ministry of Power has \nfinalized the draft Electricity Bill 2001. As with concurrent subjects (Appendix 2), consultations \nhave been held with state governments on the contents of the draft and the final version was \npresented to Parliament in 2001.7 This Bill attempts to consolidate previous acts relating to all \npower sector operations including the setting up of independent generation, transmission, and \ndistribution companies as well as regulatory agencies; national and state-level power sector \nplanning; consumer protection and dispute resolution; and safety aspects. Once enacted, the \nBill will repeal previous electricity acts, thereby providing a single comprehensive body of \nlegislation for the entire range of sector operations. As with previous acts, the Bill provides for \nany state government to hold in abeyance within its territory, provisions of the Bill for a period \nnot exceeding 6 months from the date of enactment of the Bill in order to address any \ntransitional issues. \n \n12.  The other notable features of the Bill are (i) open  access to transmission systems; \n(ii) compulsory metering of all consumers within 2 years of enacting the Bill; (iii) facilitating the \nentry of power traders as opposed to distribution service providers; (iv) prioritizing the use of \nproceeds from privatizing power sector assets; and (v) promoting more targeted and transparent \nsubsidies to the rural and economically weaker consumers. While providing a comprehensive \nframework for improvement of the power sector, the Bill also provides the necessary flexibility to \nstate governments to determine their own pace and priorities for sector reform. However, to \naccelerate the state-level reforms, the Government has also established a number of other \ninitiatives  such  as  the  Accelerated  Power  Development  and  Reform  Program.  Under  this \nProgram, state governments and their SEBs can use additional federal funds for selected types \nof power projects, based on their commitment to reforms under memorandums of agreement \nsigned with the central Government.8 \n \n                                                 \n7   The Bill is being studied by a Standing Committee of Parliament. \n8  PFC is one of the agencies designated for implementing the Accelerated Power Development and Reform \nProgram. ", "5 \n2.  Lessons Learned \n13.  Operations of ADB and other aid agencies in the power sector in India have been \ngenerally successful from a project point of view; i.e., the projects concerned have been \ncompleted, although with implementation delays, and performed to the expected technical \nlevels.  Although  operations  of  the  project  components,  taken  individually,  have  been \nsatisfactory, the overall sector performance, in terms of delivering a high quality and reliable \npower supply, continued to deteriorate. This situation was primarily on account of (i) highly \ndistorted tariff setting undermining cost recovery; (ii) government rules and regulations, and \ngovernment control of SEBs, inhibiting their performance; and (iii) the noncommercial setup of \nthe sector that failed to attract private sector players to step in to bridge the gap between \ndemand and supply or into other operational areas.  The Government and other key players \nwere beginning to realize that unless the structural framework of the sector setup was modified \nto remove the above impediments, long-term sustainable improvements could not be achieved. \n \n14.  The  policy  reforms  required  for  comprehensive  sector  restructuring  could  not  be \nintroduced earlier for a number of reasons. First of all, the India power sector was not yet ready \nfor reforms: there was no consensus among concerned agencies on what should constitute \nreforms until the adoption of the Common Minimum National Action Plan, and the necessary \nlegislation and financial incentive mechanisms were not in place. Most important, SEBs or their \nstate governments were not feeling the financial crunch as they do now. The compelling \nreasons for power sector reforms are the SEB financial burden on state governments\u2019 budgets \nand the resulting shortage of funds for other development needs. It is therefore evident that the \nopportunity offered by these events be made use of to turn the sector around. \n \n15.  The project completion report9 of the previous loan to PFC indicated a number of \nlessons to be learned. These included (i) the need for comprehensive reforms and restructuring \nof the power sector; (ii) PFC\u2019s limited leverage to influence the states to adopt key policy \nchanges; (iii) the importance of compliance with loan conditions prior to subloan approval; \n(iv) recommendations on financial criteria for subproject selection; and (v) the need to have a \nsufficiently long list of subprojects before loan approval. These lessons have been taken into \nconsideration during the project design and the subsequent discussions with PFC. \n \n3.  Asian Development Bank Operational Strategy \n16.  ADB\u2019s overall operational strategy for India consists of supporting efforts to achieve \nhigher  sustainable  economic  growth  to  promote  employment  and  reduce  poverty.  Its \ncontribution to higher growth focuses on improving supply-side efficiency of the economy, \nespecially by reducing bottlenecks in key infrastructure sectors. Emphasis is on improving the \npolicy, institutional, and regulatory framework so as to enhance the efficiency of public sector \noperations and to encourage private investment. \n \n17.  ADB's strategy for India was revised in 1996 to accommodate the need for a portion of \nits assistance to be provided in a systematic and comprehensive manner at the subnational or \nstate level. This need reflected the facts that (i) a geographic focus, together with the ongoing \nselective sector focus, enables ADB to maximize its development impact both in the states \nconcerned and, through the demonstration impact of its operations, in other states as well; \n(ii) state-level  economic  reforms,  which  have  been  lagging  behind  initiatives  taken \nby the Government,  needed  support  and  incentives;  and  (iii) the states have considerable \nautonomy and have major legislative, administrative, and fiscal responsibilities in many of the \neconomic and social sectors. Accordingly, ADB is building up the reform process from the \ngrassroots by considering assistance to those states that have demonstrated the political will to        \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2001. Project Completion Report on the Power Efficiency (Sector) Project. Manila.  ", "6 \nsubstantially reform their public sector operations, and by assisting them to operationalize these \nreforms. Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Kerala have been initially identified for ADB\u2019s holistic \nsupport.10 ADB-assisted power sector reforms in the first two states include adopting state-level \nreform bills, establishing and operationalizing independent regulatory bodies, unbundling sector \nentities along functional lines, rationalizing tariffs, and 100% metering of consumers. \n \n18.  The proposed loan is designed to complement the Government\u2019s efforts in promoting \nreforms in more states. While direct assistance to the power sector at the state level is being \ncontinued,  with  Assam  being  considered  as  the  fourth  state,  assistance  through  suitable \nfinancial intermediaries is considered as a second option. PFC has been selected as the agent \nto leverage reforms since it is very active in state-level power sector reforms and it is also the \npremier development finance institution exclusively dedicated to the sector. Through PFC, ADB \nseeks to promote power sector reforms in a greater number of states than would otherwise be \npossible by direct lending. Such an approach will broaden ADB's association with state-level \npower utilities and will complement the Government's own efforts at power sector reforms \nthrough mechanisms such as the Accelerated Power Development and Reform Program. The \nproposed loan will also mobilize additional resources in terms of counterpart funds, as ADB \nlending will be limited to 60% of the subproject costs. \n \n4.  External Assistance to the Power Sector \n19.  The power sector has received  a  major  portion  of  India's  external  assistance.  For \nexample, of ADB\u2019s total government-guaranteed lending to India, amounting to $10.317 billion \nas of 30 June 2002, 11 loans for $2.215 billion (21.5%) were approved for the power sector. The \nfirst four projects were for power generation, three were sector loans to support improvements \nin SEB efficiency and development of the national transmission grid, while the two most recent \nwere for sector development to support the restructuring of a state\u2019s power sector. In addition, \nunder its private sector operations, ADB has approved three loans and investments totaling \n$79.8 million for one captive transmission and two generation projects. Power subprojects have \nalso been considered for financing under ADB's private sector infrastructure facility and the \nInfrastructure Development Finance Company. ADB has also approved $12.9 million for 21 \ntechnical assistance grants, mainly advisory, at both the national and state levels. Previous ADB \nassistance to India\u2019s power sector is listed in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n20.  The major funding source to the sector has been the World Bank, which has supported \npower generation, transmission, and distribution projects, including assistance directed to SEBs. \nIt is now supporting power sector reforms in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Orissa, \nRajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. In Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, power sector reform is \nviewed as part of overall reform of state finances. ADB coordinates with the World Bank on the \ngeographic demarcation of state-level operations, as well as to ensure overall complementarity \nof actions at both the central and state levels. Other major agencies funding the sector are the \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  of  Germany, \nDepartment  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom  (DFID),  Canadian \nInternational  Development  Agency  (CIDA),  and  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment. Although the combined assistance of all aid agencies constitutes only about 8\u2013\n10% of the total investments in the sector, several key policy initiatives have been catalyzed as \na result. \n \n                                                 \n10  This support started with Loan 1506-IND: Gujarat Public Sector Resource Management Program and Loan 1717-\nIND: Madhya Pradesh Public Resource Management Program, each for $250 million, approved on 18 December \n1996 and 14 December 1999, respectively. They were followed by Loans 1803/1804-IND: Gujarat Power Sector \nDevelopment and Loans 1868/1869-IND: Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Development Program, each for $350 \nmillion, approved on 13 December 2000 and 6 December 2001, respectively. ", "7 \n21.  The Japan Bank for International Cooperation has been supporting the expansion of \npublic sector generation, transmission, and distribution, including rural electrification. DFID\u2019s \nexclusive objective in providing assistance is poverty reduction. It has financed studies for \npower sector restructuring in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, and Orissa. The United States Agency \nfor  International  Development  has  extensively  supported  and  continues  to  support  policy \naspects of private sector participation. It has supported studies for state sector reforms through \nPFC by providing grant assistance for energy management, conservation, and training. CIDA \nassisted Kerala in conducting extensive studies for restructuring its power sector. ADB is \nfollowing up on CIDA\u2019s work through policy dialogue and preparation for a possible loan \nintervention. Together with the World Bank, CIDA is providing similar TA  for power sector \nreforms  in  Andhra  Pradesh.  In  Madhya  Pradesh,  CIDA  and  ADB  are  cooperating  and \ncoordinating closely in providing assistance for power sector reform. Some of the major projects \nfinanced by other aid agencies are also listed in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n22.  The overall objective of the ADB assistance is to help improve the state power sector of \nIndia so that it becomes financially self-sustaining and capable of adequately providing its share \nof services to the country's economic and social development. The immediate objectives are to \n(i) promote  power  sector  reforms  in  a  few  selected  states,  (ii) help establish independent \nregulatory  bodies,  and  (iii) functionally  unbundle  the  sector  entities  so  that  they  become \ncommercially and operationally autonomous and efficient, and financially viable. To promote the \nachievement of these objectives, ADB will provide financial assistance, channeled through PFC, \nto the selected SEBs to meet part of their financing requirements for reducing system losses, \nenhancing operational flexibility and efficiency, and improving the delivery of services to the \nconsumers. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n1.  Subborrowers \n23.  Subborrowers will be selected from among SEBs11 based on written commitments by the \nconcerned state governments and SEBs to undertake power sector reforms. The main criterion \nfor eligibility will be the availability of a reform-oriented operational and financial action plan (R-\nOFAP) acceptable to PFC. The R-OFAPs may include a series of time-bound reform steps to be \ncarried  out  in  phases  (para. 31).  Each  R-OFAP  will  be  tailor-made  to  suit  the  state/SEB \nconcerned, taking into account the degree of reforms already undertaken by the state and other \nprevailing conditions in the power sector of the state. Following the adoption of an R-OFAP, \nPFC  will  review  the  investment  requirements  of  the  concerned  SEB  and  will  develop  an \nassistance plan linking specific reform steps to maximum borrowing limits for the SEB at various \nphases of the reform process. PFC will then submit the finalized R-OFAP and the assistance \nplan to ADB prior to starting lending to the SEB under ADB\u2019s line of credit. The R-OFAPs will be \nfinalized in consultation with ADB. Any subsequent modifications or amendments will be notified \nto ADB. \n \n24.  SEBs in the following states have been proposed as eligible subborrowers initially: West \nBengal, Maharashtra, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, and Karnataka. PFC will have the option of \nselecting  more  SEBs  during  loan  administration,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  should  the \n                                                 \n11  The term SEB is used to denote state electricity boards as well as other public power utilities established as a \nresult of sector restructuring. ", "8 \nsubprojects already identified appear to be inadequate to cover the total loan amount, for any \nreason. The main criterion for selecting further states/SEBs will remain the same: the availability \nof an agreed R-OFAP. Those SEBs that are already receiving assistance from ADB or the \nWorld Bank will not be entitled to the line of credit from PFC under the loan except as otherwise \nagreed with ADB. \n \n25.  To be selected, the SEBs will be required to show that they can achieve (i) at least a 3% \nROR on net fixed assets in service; and (ii) a debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of at least 1.2 \ntimes, both within such period from the date of the first subloan as indicated in the respective R-\nOFAP. For this purpose, PFC will arrange to review financial projections for the candidate SEBs \nduring  selection  to  ensure  that  the  above  requirements  can  be  met.  In  order  to  ensure \ncommitment and ownership of the subborrower to the subprojects, the SEBs will also be \nrequired to (i) commit to contribute  counterpart funds not less than 40% of the cost of the \nsubproject; and (ii) indicate satisfactory performance under the ongoing subloans, including \nmeeting targets under the R-OFAPs. The subproject appraisal reports, to be prepared for each \nsubproject by PFC, will assess whether they meet these criteria.  \n \n2.  Subprojects \n26.  While the shortage of power generating capacity has been a chronic problem in India, \ninefficient operation of existing facilities is a more urgent issue that needs to be addressed to \nimprove sector performance in the short to medium term. The loan will therefore be targeted \nmainly at those projects that will improve system operations and reduce system losses, such as \nrehabilitation of power transmission and distribution facilities. Financing will also be available for \nimproving access to electricity by extending transmission and distribution networks. R&M of \nexisting  generating  facilities  that  are  required  to  achieve  compliance  with  environmental \nregulations  and  improve  efficiency  will  also be considered. The subborrowers will have to \ndemonstrate  that  following  the  R&M  works,  generating  facilities  will  meet  applicable \nenvironmental requirements of the pollution control boards of the relevant state and other \nstatutory bodies concerned. PFC will select subprojects categorized as resettlement B or C \nonly. New generation projects or projects for extension of generation projects will not be \nselected for subloans. \n \n27.  Based on the above, the following categories of subprojects will be considered for \nfinancing under the loan: (i) transmission and distribution rehabilitation, (ii) transmission and \ndistribution facilities required for system expansion and reinforcement, and (iii) renovation and \nmodernization of existing generating plants that are required for achieving compliance with \nenvironmental regulations and efficiency improvement. \n \n28.  Subprojects will be selected on the basis of (i) being part of the least-cost option for \nmeeting  the  project  objectives;  (ii) environmental  and  social  acceptability\u2014conforming  to \nrelevant  ADB  guidelines  and  having  obtained  relevant  statutory  clearances;  (iii) economic \nviability\u2014the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) being greater than 12%; and (iv) financial \nviability\u2014the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) being greater than the weighted average \ncost of capital. The subproject appraisal reports, to be prepared for each subproject by PFC, will \nassess whether they meet these criteria. \n \n29.  PFC\u2019s Projects Division has so far identified 22 projects in West Bengal, 16 projects in \nMaharashtra, 14 projects in Assam, and 3 projects in Tamil Nadu consisting of transmission, \ndistribution, and R&M of existing power stations. The total cost of these identified projects is \nestimated  at  $392.7 million,  consisting  of  $235.6 million  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and \n$157.1 million in local currency costs. A summary of costs is given in Table 2 and the details are \npresented in Appendix 3. \n ", "9 \nTable 2: Estimated Cost of Identified Projects \n($ million) \n \nState  Total Cost   Foreign Cost   Local Cost   \nWest Bengal  65.9  39.5  26.4 \nAssam  18.2  10.9  7.3 \nMaharashtra  266.7  160.0      106.7 \nTamil Nadu  41.9  25.2  16.7 \nTotal  392.7  235.6  157.1 \n \nSource:  Power Finance Corporation \n \nC.  Special Features \n30.  Operational and financial action plans (OFAPs) are a mechanism devised in the early \n1990s  to  monitor  the  performance  of  SEBs  borrowing  from  PFC.  Formulated  by  PFC  in \nconsultations with ADB and the World Bank during the processing of the previous loans to PFC, \nOFAPs were based on the results of initial diagnostic studies of the operational and financial \nsituation of individual SEBs. The resulting OFAPs focused on technical and financial remedial \nactions to improve SEB performance, together with detailed actions for accomplishing such \nimprovements in a time-bound manner by action centers specifically identified. Key elements \nincluded  improving  power  plant  performance;  reducing  system  losses;  adjusting  tariffs; \nimproving billing and collections; and developing and streamlining financial, accounting, and \nmanagement information systems. PFC\u2019s approval of a loan to an SEB was subject to the \nformal agreement of an OFAP. PFC then monitored the implementation of the OFAP as part of \nits loan administration activities. Although OFAPs were successful in bringing about operational \nimprovements  in  SEB  performance,  there  were  some  inherent  weaknesses  in  the  OFAP \nmechanism  as  applied  initially.  First,  the  action  plans  proposed  within  the  OFAPs  were \nconstrained  by  the  structural  framework  within  which  the  power  sector  operated. Without \nstructural reforms, remedial actions could not be implemented in a sustainable manner, partly \ndue to political constraints. For example, in the absence of independent regulatory bodies, the \ntariff  adjustments  that  were  needed  to  reach  agreed  financial  performance  could  not  be \nimplemented in an equitable manner, mainly due to political interference. Second, the OFAPs \ncontained too many performance targets and the modest levels of investments and technical \nassistance could not adequately support them. Furthermore, OFAPS required much time and \neffort to monitor and enforce, and affected the smooth implementation of the supported projects. \n \n31.  Based on the lessons learned, the OFAP mechanism has been improved. Instead of \nattempting  to  achieve  improved  performance  within  the  existing  structural  framework,  the \nframework itself will be restructured to facilitate remedial actions. The restructuring may include \nunbundling SEB operations along functional lines, setting up independent regulatory bodies to \noversee sector operations and set tariffs, and introducing commercially oriented operational \ntechniques into distribution operations with performance targets. These actions are incorporated \ninto an R-OFAP. It is an action plan developed jointly by PFC, the SEB concerned, and its state \ngovernment, and agreed to by the three parties involved. A typical R-OFAP will consist of three \nor four phases. Each phase will contain a set of reform tasks to be accomplished within an \nagreed  time  frame.  The  reforms  will  include  (i) adopting  reform  measures  by  the  state \ngovernment, including a reform bill if considered necessary; (ii) establishing and operationalizing \nan  independent  SERC;  and  (iii) establishing  a  high-level  state  government  committee  to \noversee  the  reform  process  and  a  working-level  group  to  coordinate  the  reform  actions; \n(iv) formulating and filing proposals for tariff rationalization to obtain the SERC\u2019s rulings on the \nproposals; (v) implementing the SERC\u2019s tariff rulings in a time-bound manner; (vi) adopting and \ncontinuing the implementation of a policy on metering, with the eventual goal of 100% consumer \nmetering;  and  (vii) adopting  enhanced  measures  by  the  state  government  to  discourage ", "10 \nelectricity theft by imposing penalties and other measures.  A summary of a typical R-OFAP is \ngiven in Appendix 4. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n1.  Terms and Conditions of the Loan \n \n32.  PFC has requested a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help \nfinance the Project. The loan will have a 20-year term including a grace period of 5 years, with \nrepayments linked to actual disbursements under the Loan, an interest rate determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per \nannum, a front-end fee of 1.0%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan \nAgreement. PFC has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. \n \n  2.  Relending Terms and Arrangements \n \n33.  PFC will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to eligible subborrowers for subprojects \nthat ADB has agreed to. Subborrowers eligible to receive ADB funds will be only those meeting \nthe requirements set out in paras. 23 and 25. The subloans will have a maximum maturity of 15 \nyears, including a grace period not exceeding 5 years and a relending rate determined in \naccordance with PFC's Operational Policy Statement (OPS) (Supplementary Appendix B). The \nADB loan will be used only to finance a part or the whole of the direct and estimated indirect \nforeign exchange components of subprojects and will be limited to 60% of the total subproject \ncost. In all other respects, PFC will relend ADB funds in accordance with its  OPS and individual \nR-OFAPs  agreed  with  the  eligible  subborrowers.12  The  funds  accumulated  from  shorter \nrelending maturity and grace periods may be used to finance other eligible subprojects. \n \n34.  In  order  to  achieve  the  maximum  possible  reform  impacts  without  spreading  ADB \nresources too thin, it was agreed that the maximum lending limit for any single subborrower \nwould be 40% of the total ADB loan except where a higher limit is warranted due to special \ncircumstances. PFC will obtain ADB\u2019s prior approval for such increases. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \na.  Executing Agency \n35.  PFC will be the Executing Agency for the proposed loan. Its chairperson and managing \ndirector  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  management  of  the  Project.  Day-to-day \nimplementation of the Project will be carried out by the relevant divisions under guidance from \ntheir respective directors as follows. Formulation and finalization of R-OFAPs, determination of \nmaximum lending limits for R-OFAP milestones, and monitoring of their compliance will be the \nresponsibility of the Institutional Appraisal and Development Division; appraisal and approval of \nsubprojects and monitoring of their implementation, including procurement activities, will be the \nresponsibility  of  the  Projects  Division.  The  Externally  Aided  Projects  Unit  (EAPU)  will  be \n                                                 \n12  As per the OPS, the structure of interest rates to be charged by PFC would be as attractive as possible without \nendangering its own operations or overall objectives. The structure would, in general, be dependent on the cost of \nraising resources and the state of the financial markets. In certain areas, assistance may be provided on softer \nterms wherever promotional and development requirements so demand.  The interest rate structure would be \nreviewed from time to time. ", "11 \nresponsible for assessing the environmental and social feasibility of subprojects and monitoring \nthe implementation of environmental and social impact mitigation measures. EAPU, through its \nEnvironmental  Assessment  and  Monitoring  Cell,  will  also  be  responsible  for  monitoring \nresettlement preparation and implementation. The Head, EAPU will be responsible for overall \ncoordination and execution of the Project, and for liaising between PFC and ADB. A description \nof  PFC,  its  operations,  and  its  financial  performance  are  given  in  Appendix  5.  PFC's \norganization chart is in Appendix 6. \n \n36.  PFC's operational philosophy and procedures are guided by its OPS. Developed in 1990 \nin close consultation with ADB and the World Bank, and since then revised to reflect recent \nchanges in the India power sector, the OPS provides a comprehensive set of guidelines for \npower sector lending. It defines PFC\u2019s mission and objectives and sets out guidelines for project \nidentification, eligibility, lending modalities, exposure limits, guarantees and security, and project \nadministration  including  procurement  procedures.  It  also  specifies  limits  for  key  financial \nparameters, such as return on equity and DSCR, to ensure PFC\u2019s own financial health while \nlending to others. The key features of the revised OPS are (i) emphasis on power sector \nreforms in addition to project-based lending; (ii) provision of other services such as consulting \nand advisory services, foreign exchange management, and lender's engineering services; and \n(iii) assistance to private sector projects. A summary of the OPS is in Supplementary Appendix \nB. \n \n37.  Over the past 5 years, from FY1998 to FY2002, PFC\u2019s financial performance has been \non a sound level. PFC has exceeded all the financial performance targets13 agreed with the \nMinistry of Power every year for this period. Both the return on assets and the return on equity \nin FY2002 indicate adequate profitability of 5.0% and 20.4%, respectively. The DSCRs are also \nhigher than the minimum  1.2 times. PFC\u2019s  capital position,  as  measured   by its risk-weighted  \ncapital  adequacy  ratio  (CAR),14  was  25.6%  in  FY2002,  which  is  superior  by international \nstandards.15 The financial position of PFC has stabilized for a combination of reasons. First, \nPFC continuously expanded its loan size to support the growing investment needs of India\u2019s \npower sector. Second, nonperforming loans amounting to about Rs7.5 billion were restructured \nbetween FY1997 and FY2000 and as a result, PFC was able to improve cash generation. \nConsequently, PFC has maintained high overdue recovery rates of 97\u2013100% since FY1998. \nThird,  funding  cost  has  been  relatively  low  due  to  PFC\u2019s  access  to  tax-free bonds, tax \nexemption  on  loans  to  infrastructure  projects,  and  external  borrowing  with  government \nguarantees. A summary of PFC\u2019s actual financial performance is given in Table 3 and details \nare in Appendix 7.  \n \n                                                 \n13  At the end of every financial year, PFC and the Ministry of Power prepare a memorandum of understanding \n(MOU) agreement to set financial targets, e.g., sanctions, disbursements, collection, return on assets, return on \nequity, operating ratio.  \n14  The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is the ratio of total qualified capital (equity [Tier I] plus mezzanine capital [Tier II, \nIII]) to total risk-weighted assets including off-balance sheet items. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates the \nrequirements and standards based on types of financial institutions. However, PFC has been exempted from the \nrequirements. Accordingly, the calculation of CAR is based on RBI norms for nonbanking financial companies. \nWhen CAR was calculated on the two standard norms, RBI and BIS, the difference between the two values was \nless than 0.5% for 2001. \n15  The Basel Accord of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) recommends a mandatory CAR of 8% for banks \nin Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. For most developing member \ncountries (DMCs), the guidelines recommend a minimum CAR of 12%. ", "12 \nTable 3.

For the next 10 years, PFC is targeting 20% average disbursement growth based \nannually on the 10th and 11th five-year plans. PFC\u2019s profitability is likely to remain acceptable \nover the near term due to the strong demand for funds from the state power sector as well as \nfrom the central power utilities. Although aggressive expansion of the loan portfolio will result in \na gradual decline of its capital position and profitability of its assets, PFC is still expected to \ndemonstrate sound financial performance. However, it should be noted that PFC\u2019s financial \nposition will depend on its internal risk control. First, PFC will be exposed to more market risks \nby increased market borrowing and foreign currency funding, and by decreased government \nsupport,16 such as tax-free bonds, equity contributions, and regulatory exemptions. Second, in \nthe event that interest yields are lower due to a competitive financial market in the near term, \nPFC\u2019s  other  revenue  sources  besides  the  intermediary  service  are  likely  to  be  limited.17 \nFurthermore, PFC\u2019s profitability might be eroded by the deterioration in the quality of the SEB \nloan portfolio. Therefore, over the long term, PFC will be required to conduct timely risk control \nand thorough asset-liability management justified by an increase in the stable funding base at \nacceptable costs as well as by profit opportunities. A summary of PFC\u2019s projected financial \nperformance is given in Table 4 and details are in Appendix 7. Assumptions made in preparing \nthe financial projections are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n                                                 \n16  Government support, in the form of direct loans or tax-free bonds, has substantially declined over the years [(e.g., \n58% (FY1999) to 15% (FY2002)]. Particularly, the Government has made no direct loans since FY2001. There are \nno other explicit subsidies involved in PFC\u2019s lending operations. \n17  Besides its core lending business, PFC has been starting fee-based services, such as engineering consultancy \nservices.

PFC\u2019s  accounting  records  have  been  properly  maintained.  They  are  reviewed  by \nqualified statutory external auditors18 appointed by the Government. PFC also has an internal \naudit system that appears to be broadly commensurate with the size and nature of its business. \n \nb.  Subproject Selection and Appraisal \n40.  Subprojects will be selected from the eligible categories of projects listed in para. 27, \nbased on detailed project reports submitted by the subborrowers. Subproject appraisal reports \nwill then be prepared by PFC, according to the format outlined in PFC\u2019s Outline and Guiding \nPrinciples for Project-Loan Appraisal Reports. Approval procedures will follow PFC's standard \npractices  for  project  appraisal  and  approval.  Approval  of  a  subproject  will  be  subject  to \n(i) meeting the economic, financial, and environmental and social acceptance criteria as set out \nin para. 28; and (ii) not exceeding the borrowing limit assigned to the subborrower at that stage \nof the reform process. \n \n41.  The borrowing limit of a subborrower at any given stage will be governed by the R-OFAP \nmechanism. Each major milestone in the R-OFAP will be linked to a maximum borrowing limit \nfor that milestone  as indicated in para. 23. Subprojects will be approved within this applicable \nborrowing  limit  of  the  subborrower  at  any  given  time.  In  order  to  raise  the  limit,  the \nsubborrower/state government will have to satisfactorily complete the reform tasks specified for \nthe next phase. If a particular phase of the R-OFAP is not completed within the time frame \nagreed upon, PFC may, with ADB's concurrence, divert loan funds to a better performing \nsubborrower. The maximum borrowing limit, the corresponding R-OFAP milestone, and the time \nframe for achieving that will be determined at the stage of selecting the subborrower as outlined \nin para. 23. A flowchart indicating the detailed subproject approval procedure is in Appendix 8. \n \nc.  Subproject Approval \n42.  The first subproject for each SEB will be submitted to ADB for review prior to approval by \nPFC to ensure that ADB's guidelines on procurement, environmental and social assessment, \nand economic and financial analyses, as well as the terms and conditions of the ADB loan are \nfollowed. Thereafter, only subprojects exceeding $10 million in ADB financing will require prior \nreview by ADB. However, irrespective of this limit, prior review by ADB will be required for \nfinancing any subproject that either involves significant environmental impacts or resettlement. \n \n                                                 \n18  The  recent  minor  qualifications  by  auditors  in  FY2002  have  been  resolved.  The  qualifications  were \n(i) understatement of Rs1.5 crore profit, consequent to the change in accounting policy in respect of provision for \nleave encashment and (ii) an excess future claim from the Government with respect to the interest subsidy fund \naccount.  ", "14 \n2.  Implementation Period \n43.  The Project will be implemented over a period of 5 years, commencing in January 2003. \nThe commitment period during which PFC will continue to approve subprojects will be limited to \nthe first 4 years. Disbursements for the approved subprojects will continue until the end of the \nfifth year. A project implementation schedule is given in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n44.  Procurement of goods and services financed under the ADB loan will follow provisions \napplicable  to  development  finance  institutions  in  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  For \ncontracts valued at $5 million or more, subborrowers will follow international competitive bidding \nprocedures. For contracts below $5 million, PFC will ensure that competitive and transparent \nprocedures will be followed by the subborrowers in prequalifying bidders, evaluating bids, and \nawarding contracts, with due consideration of economy and efficiency. Procurement will be from \nADB member countries only. \n \n45.  ADB  management  has  approved  advanced  procurement  action.  PFC  and  the \nsubborrowers have been permitted to initiate procurement procedures for eligible subprojects, \nsuch as preparation of draft bidding documents and submission of the documents for review \nand approval by ADB after loan appraisal.  \n \n4.  Disbursement Arrangements \n46.  The proposed loan will be disbursed to finance eligible subprojects in accordance with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook, January 2001, as amended from time to time. For ease \nof loan disbursements, the Borrower may set up an imprest account with a local commercial \nbank acceptable to ADB. The imprest account will be established, managed, replenished, and \nliquidated in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook. The imprest account will \nhave a ceiling of 6 months projection and not more than 10% of the loan.  \n \n47.  PFC has opted for repayments linked to disbursements under the Loan in accordance with \nthe Policy on Review of ADB\u2019s Financial Loan Products.19  Accordingly the Loan will comprise of  \na series of amortization schedules based on aggregate disbursements under the Loan, for each \nsemestral period with a term of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years schedule.20  The final \nmaturity date under the Loan is fixed at 15 October 2028 applicable to the disbursements made \nduring the last semester of the loan closing date at 30 June 2008.  \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n48.  PFC will require subborrowers to maintain separate subloan accounts and records in a \nmanner that facilitates assessment of the performance of each of its subprojects. PFC will \nsubmit to ADB these subloan accounts when required by ADB. PFC will also submit to ADB \nunaudited financial statements of subborrowers within 9 months of the close of the financial \nyear, and audited financial statements within 12 months of the close of the financial year. \n \n49.  PFC will submit to ADB, within 9 months of the close of the financial year, audited \nfinancial statements of PFC consisting of an income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow \nstatement (audited by an auditor acceptable to ADB), financial projections, and portfolio reports \nshowing asset quality and capital adequacy in the form and complying with criteria requested by \nADB, and within 6 months of the close of the financial year, unaudited financial statements of \n                                                 \n19  R79-01, Revision 1, Final dated 19 June 2001. \n20 R79-01, Revision 1, Final dated 19 June 2001, paragraphs 42-26. ", "15 \nPFC. Before  31 December of each year, PFC will review its ability and meet its financial \nobligations and take necessary steps to meet with such requirements under the Loan. A \nconsolidated progress report will be prepared for each subborrower and its subprojects and \nsubmitted to ADB on a 6-monthly basis. The report will cover (i) compliance with R-OFAPs, \n(ii) appraisal of subprojects, (iii) implementation of subprojects, (iv) subproject compliance with \nADB's social and environmental guidelines, (v) progress on commitment and disbursement of \nfunds, and (vi) such other information as may be reasonably required for ADB to monitor the \nuse of loan proceeds. A project completion report, covering all major aspects of loan utilization \nand subproject implementation, will be submitted within 6 months of the closing of the loan \naccounts of each subborrower and within six months of closing of the Loan. \n \n6.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n50.  PFC,  with  the  assistance  of  the  subborrowers,  will  carry  out  project  performance \nmonitoring and evaluation and benefit monitoring and evaluation through periodic reviews of the \nsubprojects in accordance with ADB\u2019s Project Performance Management Systems Handbook. \nFor this purpose, PFC will compile and analyze socioeconomic and other appropriate data such \nas the number of beneficiaries, tariff levels, and institutional improvements of the borrowing \nentities as well as of the subprojects concerned. The appraisal report for each subproject and \nthe initial social assessment reports for each state will provide the baseline data, which will be \nupdated through the periodic reviews. The findings of these reviews and supporting data will be \nincorporated into a project completion report for each state. \n \n7.  Project Review \n51.  ADB will conduct regular reviews throughout project implementation. In particular, a \nmidterm review covering the entire scope of the Project will be conducted during mid 2005 to \ndetermine  whether  any  adjustments  to  the  implementation  of  the  R-OFAP  mechanism, \nprocurement procedures, and project management arrangements are required. \n \n52.  PFC, on its part, will also carry out regular project reviews of its subborrowers. These \nreviews  will  cover  procurement,  availability  of  counterpart  funds,  project  implementation \nprogress, and implementation of the  R-OFAP for each subborrower. The findings of these \nreviews will be consolidated into a semiannual progress report for each subborrower and will be \nsubmitted to ADB. \n \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits \n53.  The financial health of many of the SEBs has been deteriorating due to insufficient cost \nrecovery.  Inadequate  tariffs  and  high  operating  costs  have  squeezed  their  profit  margins. \nFurthermore, low collection of receivables, high T&D losses, and unpaid state government \nsubsidies (to compensate for free power supply to agricultural or domestic customers) have \naccelerated SEBs\u2019 financial difficulties. The Planning Commission of India estimates the SEBs\u2019 \nlosses at Rs248 billion ($5.174 billion) and uncovered subsidy outstanding  at Rs290 billion \n($6.037 billion) for FY2002. Consequently, most of the SEBs are now being restructured under \nvarious initiatives in order to achieve financial viability and improve operational efficiency. The \nproposed loan will be utilized to support the reform-minded states and their SEBs. First, the loan \nconditions require recipient states to undertake reforms including tariff rationalization through \nSERCs, which will help generate financial profits. Second, as the subloans focus on system \nimprovement through rehabilitation, modernization, and upgrading of transmission, distribution, \nand generation infrastructure, as well as on metering, the subprojects will contribute to financial ", "16 \nrecovery through increased efficiency, lower T&D losses, and better metering and collections. \nAll these improvements are expected to improve the financial condition of the assisted agencies \nand minimize financial risks. \n \n54.  The indirect benefits attributable to the proposed loan are substantial. For example, tariff \nrationalization by independent regulatory bodies will result in more equitable tariff levels across \nconsumer  categories,  leading  to  efficient  allocation  of  financial  and  economic  resources. \nImprovements in the quality of power supply will enhance agricultural production and will \ndiscourage the use of inefficient captive power generation by agricultural and certain industrial \nconsumers. Improvement of the financial position of utilities will reduce the burden on state \ngovernment budgets for subsidies and will enable them to allocate more budgetary resources to \nother needy sectors of the economy such as education, health, and rural infrastructure. Finally, \nthe independent tariff decisions by the SERC and a stable power supply through system \nimprovements will encourage more private sector participation both in the power sector and in \nother parts of the economy. \n \nB.  Project Impacts \n1.  Social \n55.  PFC's precondition for selecting eligible SEBs is the availability of an R-OFAP (Appendix \n4) that outlines the reform steps and social aspects of reforms. For example, the R-OFAP \nprepared for the West Bengal State Electricity Board describes the functions of the SEB; \nrequirements for electrification in rural and urban areas as well as for different consumer \ncategories; unbundling of SEB operations; SEB financial management; rationalization of tariffs; \nservices to poor and vulnerable groups and to agricultural consumers; and management of tariff \nsubsidies. Recommendations regarding proposed reforms are under the management of a high-\nlevel steering committee. R-OFAP recognizes the need to provide services at affordable prices \nto the poor and to disadvantaged groups. R-OFAP also identifies the need to address this issue \nand the state government's responsibility to reimburse the SEB for any subsidies. The West \nBengal State Electricity Board has set up a task force to address the impacts of reform, \nincluding human resources impacts of reorganizing the power sector. Similar approaches will be \nundertaken by each state government and their respective SEBs. A summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy form is attached as Appendix 10. \n \n56.  ADB  has  agreed  with  PFC  on  procedures  to  screen  and  classify  subprojects.  To \nfacilitate the screening process, screening forms and a flow-chart for triggering actions by PFC \nwere developed by ADB staff. PFC\u2019s newly established EAPU will be responsible for managing \nsocial issues, including resettlement. Additional staff have been assigned to EAPU to ensure \nthat adequate human resources are available. PFC and SEB staff participated in a training \nprogram on environment and resettlement administered by ADB staff. PFC staff will receive \nfurther  training  on  resettlement  through  the  India  Resident  Mission\u2019s  training  program, \nspecifically designed for development finance institutions. PFC confirmed that only subprojects \nwith insignificant resettlement will be financed; subprojects therefore fall within categories B and \nC only. Any subproject in category A that may be considered for financing will not be included \nwithout prior consent from ADB. A resettlement framework is attached in Appendix 11. Loan \ncovenants will be included to ensure that short resettlement plans are forwarded to ADB prior to \nthe award of civil works contracts. PFC will monitor resettlement but ADB will reserve the right \nto monitor subprojects. \n \n2.  Environmental \n57.  The types of subprojects to be financed under the proposed loan vary from rehabilitation \nof transmission and distribution facilities, expansion of transmission and distribution systems, to ", "17 \nrenovation  and  modernization  of  existing  generating  plants.  Under  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Requirements, the subprojects could fall under environment category B or C. It has \ntherefore been agreed between ADB and PFC that an initial environmental examination (IEE) \nreport be prepared for each subproject that is categorized as a \"B\" project, in accordance with \nthe Environmental Assessment Requirements. In addition, each R&M subproject will need an \nIEE report. An environmental review procedure was developed by ADB staff and agreed with \nPFC to be implemented. The procedure includes screening and approval of subprojects and is \npresented in Appendix 12. \n \n58.  A summary IEE of a typical subproject representing a transmission and distribution \nproject is given in Appendix 13. The summary IEE shows that the environmental impacts will be \nminimal  and  temporary.  These  impacts  are  mostly  related  to  land  clearing  activities  and \ntransport of construction equipment to the subproject area. The proposed mitigation measures \nidentified by the IEE are manageable and are mostly related to the contractor\u2019s obligations. The \nmitigation measures under the proposed management plan will be covenanted by PFC in its \nloan  agreement  with  the  concerned  subborrower.  Although  the  environmental  impacts  of \nsubprojects  will  be  minimal,  regular  monitoring  to  ensure  proper  implementation  of \nenvironmental management plans will be carried out by PFC, particularly for subprojects where \npolychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) has been used in the past. \n \nC.  Project Risks \n59.  The main risk is the financial viability of the SEBs and hence of PFC. PFC\u2019s asset quality \nis vulnerable to the poor creditworthiness of its SEB clients. PFC has attempted to mitigate this \ncredit risk by securing its loans through escrow account arrangements and state government \nguarantees. Escrow account arrangements cover 1.25 times the present and future debt service \nof SEBs owing money to PFC. PFC assesses escrowable capacity of an SEB based on the \nfuture cash flow in the \u201cwith reform\u201d scenario. Therefore, loans to an SEB could be under-\ncollateralized if reforms do not produce the incremental cash flow as projected. This risk is \nexpected to be mitigated by state government guarantees. In addition, to avoid this risk, PFC \nneeds to select subborrowers based strictly on the proposed R-OFAP mechanism and to ensure \ntimely  risk  control  management.  The  Asset-Liability  Management  Committee  that  was \nestablished within PFC in December 2001 is expected to ensure such risk control management, \nincluding appropriate  resource mobilization to bridge the liquidity gap, currency exchanges, \ncurrency variations, and market fluctuations, thereby ensuring stable funding and profitability.21 \nIn addition, PFC will need to monitor and control loan portfolio quality, its proper provisioning, \nand the resulting capital adequacy in a recurrent manner. These efforts will minimize the risks \nassociated with PFC as a borrower. \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n60.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and PFC have given the \nfollowing assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents. \n \nA.  General \n(i)  PFC will carry out its operations in accordance with the OPS adopted by \nits board of directors. \n \n                                                 \n21  To meet liabilities due to currency depreciation, PFC has maintained a separate trust fund, the Exchange Risk \nAdministration Fund, since 1994. In 2001, PFC also started hedging interest rate and exchange risks through \nswaps. ", "18 \n(ii)  PFC will not lend the proceeds of the ADB loan to any subborrower \nwithout a finalized R-OFAP or other eligibility criteria satisfactory to PFC. \n \n(iii)  PFC will not preallocate ADB funds among borrowers or states but will \nlend strictly in accordance with eligibility and exposure criteria set out in \nits OPS and lending limits established using the R-OFAP mechanism. \n \n(iv)  For financing under the ADB loan, except as otherwise agreed with ADB, \nPFC will not select subprojects (a) from subborrowers already receiving \nassistance  from  ADB  or  the  World  Bank  or  (b) that  involve  new \ngeneration projects or extension of existing generation projects. \n \n(v)  PFC will ensure that EAPU is fully functional and adequately staffed \nthroughout the implementation of the Project. \n \nB.  Financial \n(i)  PFC will maintain a DSCR of not less than 1.2 and a capital adequacy \nratio based on new prudential norms, of not less than 12%. \n(ii)  Except as otherwise agreed by ADB, PFC will maintain (a) a net profit \nbefore tax to beginning value of its equity (where equity includes reserves \nand  retained  earnings)  of  not  less  than  15%  and  (b) liquid \ninvestments/lines of credit adequate to meet projected disbursements. \n(iii)  PFC will adopt the formulated new prudential norms (including asset \nclassification,  provisioning,  capital  adequacy,  risk  assessments,  and \nasset-liability management) within the time frame as agreed with the \nGovernment as soon as available and not later than March 2003. \n \nC.  Resettlement \n(i)  PFC will ensure through the subloan agreements that (a) the subprojects \nare implemented in accordance with the ADB's policy on involuntary \nresettlement and where applicable ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples, \n(b)  the  resettlement  framework  will  form  the  basis  for  preparing \nresettlement plans for each subproject that has land acquisition and/or \nresettlement impacts, and (c) all efforts are made to avoid or minimize \nland acquisition and resettlement impacts.  \n  \n(ii)  Prior  to  selecting  a  subborrower,  PFC  will  prepare  a  social  impact \nassessment for the respective eligible state to assess social impacts of \nreforms and the subprojects financed under the loan.  \n \n(iii)  PFC  will  only  select  subprojects  that  are  classified  as  B  or  C  in \naccordance with the resettlement framework. For subprojects that involve \nland  acquisition  or  resettlement,  the  initial  screening  checklist  for \ninvoluntary resettlement and the initial social and poverty screening form \nwill be submitted. \n \n(iv)  PFC will ensure that (a) civil works contracts will not be awarded until a \nresettlement plan as agreed between ADB, PFC, and the subborrower \nhas been approved; and (b) works will not commence until after the \nsubborrower acquires the land and rights to the land, free from any ", "19 \nencumbrances. A compliance memorandum indicating compliance with \nADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, signed by the Head, EAPU will \nbe forwarded to ADB along with the resettlement plan. PFC will also \nsubmit  6-monthly  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  with  regard  to  land \nacquisition and resettlement under the subprojects. \n \n(v)  PFC will not select subprojects (a) where litigation is ongoing or where \ncompensation payments are outstanding; or (b) that are category A in \naccordance with ADB's policy on involuntary resettlement or projects that \naffect  more  than  100  individuals  belonging  to  indigenous \npeoples/scheduled tribes.  \n \n(vi)  PFC will designate one staff member within EAPU to be responsible for \nhandling  resettlement-related  issues,  including  preparation  of \nresettlement  plans  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  resettlement \nimplementation.  \n \n(vii)  PFC will ensure that subprojects that require resettlement plans will be \nprepared and implemented in consultation with affected persons and that \nresettlements plans are disclosed to the public. The mechanisms for \ndisclosure will be discussed in the resettlement plan. PFC will be guided \nby ADB\u2019s Handbook on Poverty and Social Assessment and Handbook \non Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. \n \nD.  Environment \n(i)  PFC will ensure through subloan agreements that all subprojects (a) \ncomply with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Requirements and the IEE \nand  (b) are  implemented  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Environmental \nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. \n \n(ii)  PFC will be responsible for reviewing the IEE of all subprojects with an \ninvestment cost of less than $10 million and for formulating the relevant \ncovenants for the same under the subloan agreements.  \n \n(iii)  PFC will forward to ADB for approval, IEE reports for all subprojects (a) \nthat have significant impacts or (b) that have a capital cost of more than \n$10 million.  PFC  will  include  in  the  subloan  agreements  required \nenvironmental covenants as recommended by ADB for these subprojects. \n \n(iv)  PFC will not select subprojects that (a) are environment category A and \nsensitive  category  B,  as  per  ADB's  Environmental  Assessment \nRequirements or (b)  involve capacity expansion of coal-based power \nplants except where appropriate clean technology and pollution control \nmeasures are adopted by the SEB. \n \n(v)  PFC will undertake an environmental monitoring program to ensure that \neach of its borrowers implements all mitigation measures as stated in the \nrelevant IEE report. \n \n(vi)  PFC will ensure that environmental aspects of all subprojects are properly \ndocumented and made available to the public if requested. \n \n ", "20 \nVI.

Introduction \n1.  To sustain the pace of economic growth achieved during the last decade in India, which \nis necessary for significantly reducing the incidence of poverty, development of the basic \ninfrastructure  facilities  is  essential.  Electricity  is  one  of  the  key  inputs  for  India's  overall \nsocioeconomic development, especially in commercial and industry sectors, and has strong \nlinkages to other infrastructure elements, such as transport and telecommunications. Basic \nhuman needs, such as water supply and sewerage, and many social welfare activities, such as \neducation  and  health  care,  are  also  directly  or  indirectly  supported  by  electricity  supply. \nAlthough  India's  power  sector  has  seen  impressive  growth  with,  for  example,  generation \ncapacity increasing from 2,000 megawatts (MW) in 1950 to 105,000 MW in 2002, it still suffers \nfrom severe deficiencies. These include chronic power shortages, unacceptably high  system \nlosses, poor supply reliability, and highly inefficient utility operations. \n \n2.  Earlier attempts, during the 1980s and early 1990s by the Government, multilateral and \nbilateral aid agencies, and state governments to rectify these deficiencies have had only limited \nsuccess. Attempts were often piecemeal, directed at micro-level corrections within the existing \ninstitutional framework, and lacked a holistic approach to address the basic power sector \nproblems. It is now being realized that comprehensive sector reforms, supported by investments \ntargeted  to  remove  technical  and  institutional  bottlenecks,  are  essential  to  improve  the \nperformance of the sector.  \n \nB.  The Sector Setup \n1.  Organization \n3.  India consists of 29 states and six union territories with a total population of over \n1 billion. The organization of the power sector is determined by the country's federal structure. \nThe subject of electricity is covered under the Concurrent List in the Constitution of India, \nimplying that both the central Government  and state governments have the power to make \nlegislation for the sector. As a result, all major issues affecting the power sector require \nconcurrent  action  by  the  central  Government  and  state  governments.  The  Government's \nMinistry  of  Power  provides  overall  guidance  to  the  sector  through  the  Central  Electricity \nAuthority. The recently established Central Electricity Regulatory Commission is empowered to \nregulate the central power utilities in accordance with the Electricity Regulatory Commission \nAct, 1998. The central power utilities include the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), \nthe National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC), and the Nuclear Power Corporation \n(NPC), which are engaged in generation, and the Powergrid Corporation, which is engaged in \ninterstate power transmission. The Government also owns financing institutions devoted solely \nto power sector lending such the Power Finance Corporation Limited (PFC) and the Rural \nElectrification  Corporation.  Recently,  the  Government  established  the  Power  Trading \nCorporation, to be responsible for power trading among states and between states and central \npower utilities. \n \n4.  At the state level, the state governments control the sector through 21 state electricity \nboards (SEBs)1 and 14 electricity departments (EDs). These SEBs and EDs are responsible for \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution, usually within their own states and territories. The \n                                                 \n1  Seven of these SEBs have been restructured into separate generation, transmission, and distribution entities. ", "  Appendix 2  25 \ncentral power utilities own and operate 30% of the country's total generation capacity, while \nSEBs and EDs have 59% of the total. In addition, five privately owned utilities, operating in \ncertain urban centers and responsible for power distribution within their franchised areas, and \nsome independent power producers have a share of 11% of the generation. \n \nC.  State Electricity Boards \n5.  Most of the SEBs are vertically integrated entities, and are wholly owned by their \nrespective state governments. The Electricity Act of 1910 and the Electricity (Supply) Act of \n1948 provide the legal basis for their establishment and operation. Since their establishment, \nthe SEBs have grown substantially in terms of meeting the demand for electricity and now \naccount for approximately 80% of commercial electricity sales in the country. Although the \nelectricity acts allowed considerable managerial and financial autonomy to the SEBs, most state \ngovernments used them as vehicles for pursuing their social and political objectives. These \nincluded low tariffs for agricultural and residential consumers and employment to attract political \nsupport. The state governments also tend to interfere with SEBs\u2019 day-to-day operations, thereby \ncomplicating  the  task  of  SEB  management.  These  interventions  have  led  to  the  SEBs\u2019 \ndeteriorating financial performance, which has become the main issue hindering power sector \ndevelopment in India. \n \n6.  A  sick  and  underperforming  power  sector  has  far-reaching  repercussions  on  other \nsectors  of  the  economy.  Unavailability  of  adequate  and  reliable  power  is  impeding  the \nGovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  attract  domestic  and  foreign  investment  to  sectors,  such  as \ntelecommunications and information technology, which are vital to the Government\u2019s medium-\nterm development plans. If not improved, it will be one of the major constraints to the economic \ndevelopment of India in the coming years. The cash-starved SEBs have also been a big drain \non the state governments\u2019 financial resources. The diversion of resources to SEBs has forced \nstate  governments  to  curtail  their  activities  in  other  priority  sectors,  such  as  health  and \neducation, which are essential for poverty reduction. Power sector reforms at the state level \ntherefore require greater momentum to foster overall economic development and to conserve \nstate financial resources to meet important social and other development objectives. \n \nD.  Central Power Utilities \n7.  To  address  the  shortage  of  generating  capacity  and  to  improve  the  efficiency  of \ngeneration, the Government established three central sector power utilities\u2014NTPC, NHPC, and \nNPC in 1975. Their mandate was to efficiently generate bulk power for sale to SEBs. In 1989, \nthe  Powergrid  Corporation  was  established  as  a  transmission  and  dispatch  agency  by \namalgamating the transmission and power dispatch facilities of other central power utilities. \nRecently, the Government has established the Power Trading Corporation, which will take over \nthe responsibility for power trading among central utilities and SEBs as well as among SEBs. In \naddition to these wholly owned companies, the Government also owns shares in special-\npurpose  power  generating  companies.  The  central  agencies,  such  as  NTPC,  NHPC,  and \nPowergrid, are seriously affected by the poor financial health of most SEBs, as has been \nevidenced several times in the past when excessive accounts receivable from those SEBs \nseriously impaired the central agencies\u2019 financial liquidity. \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nE.  Sector Performance \n1.  Technical Performance \n8.  In terms of capacity addition, performance during the Eighth Plan (FY1993\u20131997) was \nonly 54% of target, having added only 16,422 MW instead of the targeted 30,538 MW. The \nNinth Plan envisaged a total addition of 40,245 MW during the FY1998\u20132002 period, consisting \nof 11,909 MW by central sector agencies, 10,748 MW by state utilities, and 17,588 MW by the \nprivate sector independent power producers (IPPs). However, the actual capacity addition fell \nfar short of target, with the central sector meeting only 37.8% and the private sector 28.8% of \ntarget. The state sector performed better, achieving 87.9% of target. Given the SEBs\u2019 difficulties \nassociated with establishing adequate escrow accounts to service power purchase contracts \nand the attendant problems in achieving financial closure for IPP projects currently in India, \nrealizing the full IPP contribution to the generation addition appears to be unlikely in the \nimmediate future.  \n \n9.  While new generation addition has fallen short of target, the existing generating plants, \nmainly coal-fired thermal power plants, have shown improved performance during the recent \npast. With a renovation and modernization program for thermal power stations, introduced in the \nearly 1990s, the plant load factor2\u2014a performance indictor\u2014has increased from 64.4% in \nFY1997 to 69.9%  in FY2002.  According to the Common Minimum National Action Plan (para. \n10 of main text), the overall plant load factor was expected to increase to a minimum of 65% for \nstate owned utilities and to a national average of 70% by 2002.  However, given the substantial \nshortage in capacity addition, these improvements in the performance of existing generating \nplants are inadequate to narrow down the demand-supply gap. Although, by the end of FY2002, \nIndia had a total installed capacity of 105,000 MW, there was a peak power deficit of 12.6% and \nan energy deficit of 7.5%. The per capita electricity consumption stood at 355 kilowatt-hour \n(kWh) in FY2002, compared to, for example, 719 kWh for the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n \n10.  Operational performance, measured in terms of transmission and distribution (T&D) \nlosses, has also been not satisfactory. T&D losses are reported to have increased from 24.5% \nin FY1997 to 27.8% in FY2002 for the entire country. In the absence of adequate metering \narrangements, especially for agricultural consumers, part of the losses used to be lumped \ntogether with agricultural consumption. The actual losses are, therefore, thought to be much \nhigher, with some SEBs now reporting T&D losses as high as 45\u201357%.3 The major reasons for \nsuch high losses are pilferage of energy through unauthorized connections and tampering of \nmeters, and technical losses originating from overloaded distribution networks. \n \n2.  Financial Performance  \n11.  Since SEBs account for almost 80% of commercial electricity sales in the country, the \nfinancial performance of the entire sector, including that of central sector agencies, is heavily \ndependent on the performance of SEBs. Under the Electricity (Supply) Act of 1948, amended in \n1984, the financial performance of the SEBs used to be measured in terms of rate of return \n(ROR) on net fixed assets with a mandated minimum ROR of 3 %. However, none of the SEBs \nachieved this mandated minimum without a subsidy from their state governments, and only \nKarnataka achieved a 3% ROR with the government subsidy. All the others posted negative \nRORs. As indicated in Table A2 below, the consolidated performance of all SEBs show that the \n                                                 \n2   Defined as the ratio of actual capacity utilization of the plant to its rated capacity utilization. \n3   For example, T&D losses for Delhi are reported to be 57%. ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nminimum required value was not achieved during the recent past, and indeed, deteriorated over \nthe period indicated. The major reasons for this unsatisfactory financial performance were the \nincreasing gap between the cost of supply and the average tariff, and the decreasing recovery \nrate. These figures stood at Rs1.10 per kWh and 68.6%, respectively, in FY2002. \n \nTable A2.

Planning Commission.  \n \n12.  The poor financial performance of SEBs and the resulting shortage of liquidity have also \nadversely affected the SEBs\u2019 operational efficiency and led to increasing T&D losses. With the \nlimited financial resources available, the tendency of most of the SEBs has been to invest a \nlarger proportion in generation to address the demand-supply gap and less in transmission and \ndistribution. Over the years, this approach has led to inadequate distribution facilities resulting in \noverloading, inadequate maintenance, high T&D losses, and poor supply reliability, which in turn \nled to insufficient revenue\u2014a vicious circle. \n \nF.  Government Policies and Plans \n13.  For more than half a century, the Indian Electricity Act of 1910 and the Electricity \n(Supply) Act of 1948 provided the basic framework for power sector operations. They provided \nfor the establishment of SEBs, EDs, and central sector utilities and contributed to the current \nstatus of development of the sector serving a population of more than 1 billion people. However, \nwith the worldwide changes in economic and financial outlook and technological developments, \nthe  sector  needed  comprehensive  reforms  to  provide  the  flexibility  required  to  meet  the \nchallenges  that  lay  ahead.  The  Government's  initial  approach  to  the  issue  was  not \ncomprehensive enough. For example, to promote private sector participation in generation \nprojects, the Government, in 1991, amended certain parts of the Electricity Act, 1910 to facilitate \nmobilization of domestic and foreign private funds and to allow incentives, such as high returns \non investments. Although there was some initial enthusiasm from the private sector, these \nmeasures have not resulted in more than 6,800 MW of capacity addition so far. The problem lay \nwith the structural weaknesses of the sector setup, especially with the SEBs whose financial \nperformance did not provide sufficient comfort to potential investors. In 1993, as a result of \nefforts made by the National Development Council,4 a high-level committee on power was \nconstituted.  In  its  report,  submitted  in  October  1994,  the  committee  recommended \n                                                 \n4   The National Development Council is India's highest political body comprising the chief ministers of all the states \nin India, and chaired by the Prime Minister. ", "28  Appendix 2 \n(i) organizational reforms at the state level aimed at unbundling generation, transmission, and \ndistribution operations of the SEBs and commercializing the ensuing entities; (ii) organizational \nreforms at the national and regional levels aimed at freeing the central sector agencies from \ntight government control, reducing the Government's equity in these agencies so as to enable \nparticipation of the private sector on a joint-venture basis; (iii) large-scale involvement of the \nprivate sector in generation and transmission, with sponsors selected through transparent and \ncompetitive bidding procedures; (iv) creation of national and regional tariff boards to take over \nthe  responsibility  for  tariff  setting  independently  of  the  central  Government  and  state \ngovernments; and (v) a progressive phasing out of subsidies to agricultural consumers. These \nrecommendations ultimately led to the adoption by the National Development Council of a \nCommon Minimum National Action Plan for Power in 1996. To operationalize some of the \nrecommendations, the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Act was enacted in 1998, enabling \nthe establishment of independent regulatory bodies at the central and state levels. Although this \nwas a significant step toward improving the sector, it was not comprehensive enough to cover \ncomplete  sector  restructuring.  The  Government  set  up  the  Central  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission under the Act, to be responsible for regulating power sector operations at the \nnational level, related to generation and interstate transmission. The state governments were \ngiven the option to set up their own state electricity regulatory commissions (SERCs) under the \nAct or under bills to be passed by their own legislative assemblies. As a result and sometimes \non their own, some states have taken the initiative of reforming their power sectors. Foremost \namong them was Orissa, which, with World Bank assistance, completely unbundled its SEB and \nestablished the country's first SERC in 1996. The SEB's power generation business was \nentrusted  to  two  power  corporations,  transmission  to  a  grid  corporation,  and  distribution \noperations  to  four  companies  that  were  subsequently  privatized.  Reforms  in  Orissa  were \nfollowed by similar reforms in Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh with \nWorld Bank assistance and in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh with ADB assistance.  \n  \n14.  To promote more comprehensive reforms in the power sector, the Ministry of Power has \nfinalized the draft Electricity Bill 2001. As in the case with concurrent subjects (see para. 4 of \nmain text), consultations have been held with state governments on the contents of the draft, \nand the final version was presented to Parliament in 2001.5 This Bill attempts to consolidate \nprevious  acts  relating  to  all  power  sector  operations  including  setting  up  of  independent \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution companies, regulatory agencies, national and state-\nlevel power sector planning, consumer protection and dispute resolution, and safety aspects. \nOnce  enacted,  the  Bill  will  repeal  previous  electricity  acts,  thereby  providing  a  single \ncomprehensive body of legislation for the entire range of sector operations. As in the case with \nprevious acts, the Bill provides for any state government to hold in abeyance, within its territory, \nprovisions of the Bill for a period not exceeding 6 months from the date of enactment of the Bill \nin order to address any transitional issues. \n \n15.  The most notable features of the Bill are (i) open access to transmission systems with \ntransmission  service  providers  prohibited  from  holding  interests  in  generation  assets; \n(ii) compulsory metering of all consumers within 2 years of enactment of the Bill; (iii) facilitating \nthe entry of power traders as opposed to distribution service providers; (iv) prioritizing the use of \nproceeds from privatizing power sector assets to compensate staff affected by such privatization \nand then to retire debts and other liabilities; and (v) promoting more targeted and transparent \nsubsidies to the rural and economically weaker consumers. While providing a comprehensive \nframework for improvement of the power sector, the Bill also provides the necessary flexibility to \nthe state governments to determine their own pace and priorities for sector reform. \n                                                 \n5  The Bill is still awaiting approval by Parliament.

PLAN (R-OFAP) \n \nA.  Overview \n \n1.  The overview consists of a description of the state power sector including information on \nexisting power generation, transmission, and distribution facilities; previous investments in the \nsector; and an analysis of the future investment needs. It also includes recommendations of the \nvarious power sector reform committees and consultants, on which the R-OFAP milestones are \nbased. \n \nB.  Power Sector Reforms \n \n2.  The R-OFAP contains a number of detailed reform steps, divided into broad categories. \nEach  reform  step  is  associated  with  a  target  completion  date,  responsibility  center,  and \nresources required. The following are extracted from the R-OFAPs for Karnataka and West \nBengal. \n \n1.  Structural Reforms \n3.  These include: submission of recommendations for sector unbundling; identification of \nassets and liabilities; restructuring of the sector into separate functional entities; segregation of \nassets  and  operational  areas;  issue  of  procedures  for  appointment  of  professionals  into \nstructured entities; and appointment of boards of directors. \n \n2.  Financial Reforms \n4.  These include: adoption of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP); developing \nfinancial instruction manuals; introduction of activity-based costing; developing MIS to monitor \nrevenue and expenditure in activity centers; training;  finalization, approval, registration, and \noperationalization  of  Pension  Trust;  identification  and  valuing  fixed  assets; action plan for \nclearing arrears and its implementation; identification of outstanding liabilities; preparation of \nfinancial projections; preparation of provisional balance sheets for restructured entities; and \nsettlement of government subsidies according to regulator's rulings. \n \n3.  Transfer Scheme \n5. These include: transfer of personnel to newly created agencies; and Government to arrange \nfor meeting unfunded pension liabilities.  \n \n4.  Human Resources Development \n6. These include: developing organization structures for new agencies;  assessment of staffing \nrequirements for the new agencies and training needs; preparation and implementation of a \nvoluntary separation scheme; and preparation and implementation of incentive schemes for \nemployees.  \n \n5.  State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) \n7.   These  include:  establishing  SERC;  providing  SERC  with  adequate  budget  and \ninfrastructure facilities; issue of customer charter and commercial standards; and carrying out ", "  Appendix 4  33 \neffective  communication  and  information  campaigns  to  disseminate  information to various \nstakeholders.  \n \n6.  Tariff Rationalization \n8.  These include: establishing working groups to compile and analyze load forecasts, \navailability of power, classification of costs and their allocation, costs to various consumer \ngroups, revenue requirements, rate of return, etc.; developing tariff proposals for consideration \nby SERC; and modifying and revising tariffs in accordance with SERC rulings.  \n \n7.  Regional Business/Profit Centers \n9.  These include: deciding to establish business or profit centers; signing memorandums of \nunderstanding  for  their  performance;  evaluating  performance  of  business  centers;  and \ndeveloping schemes for incentives/disincentives for motivating business centers to achieve \ntargets in the memorandums of understanding. \n \n \n ", "34  Appendix 5 \n \n \nPOWER FINANCE CORPORATION \n \n1.  The Power Finance Corporation (PFC) was established by the Government in 1986 as \nan independent public sector company under the Companies Act and started operations in \nJanuary  1988.  Its  main  objectives  are  to  finance,  facilitate,  and  promote  power  sector \ndevelopment in India, including private sector power projects. PFC's areas of financing cover all \ntypes of power projects other than rural electrification. In addition to lending operations, PFC is \nalso involved in providing technical assistance and advisory services to state electricity boards \n(SEBs). As a financial institution, PFC was accorded sovereign rating of Ba21 by Moody's \nInvestor Service and AAA by two local credit rating agencies in 2002. \n \n2.  The memorandum of association of PFC prescribes that its board will consist of between \nthree  and  15  directors.  Currently,  it  has  four  full-time  members  including  the \nchairperson/managing director and two part-time members representing the Ministry of Power. \nThe chairperson/managing director is in overall charge of PFC operations. Its operations are \norganized  into  three  separate  groups,  each  headed  by  a  full-time  director.  The  Director \n(Institutional  Development  and  Administration)  is  responsible  for  human  resources,  legal \naspects and administration, management systems, and institutional appraisal and development \nof borrowing power sector clients. The Director (Projects) is in charge of project appraisal and \nadministration, management information systems, and technical development. The Director \n(Finance  and  Financial  Operations)  is  responsible  for  financial  and  legal  operations,  fund \ngeneration, international financing operations, and loan disbursement and recovery. PFC's loan \nand project appraisal and administration are structured on a regional basis, with five regions\u2014\nnorthern, southern, western, eastern, and northeastern\u2014covering the entire country, thereby \nproviding a better regional focus. At the end of FY2002, it had a total staff of 272, consisting of \n157 employees of executive level and above, and 115 in other categories. PFC's organization \nchart is in Appendix 6. \n \n3.  Human resources development has been a high priority activity for PFC. In the early \n1990s,  the  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  and  the  former \nOverseas Development Administration of the United Kingdom provided substantial assistance to \ntrain PFC and some SEB staff in project preparation, project appraisal, and financial operations. \nAs a result of this early training, PFC now has a skilled workforce capable of successfully \nhandling all aspects related to power sector lending. To complement its development of human \nresources, PFC, in 1998, also introduced modern computer-based management systems. The \nareas  computerized  include  human  resources  management,  financial  and  operational \nmanagement such as financial accounting, bond management, loan accounting, recoveries, and \nproject and loan appraisal and sanction, and office automation. These developments have \nlargely contributed to the substantial expansion of its operations without increasing its overhead \ncosts. In fact, PFC has been able to increase disbursements by 3.3 times and net profits by 3.1 \ntimes while marginally increasing its staff resources by 17% during the period FY1996\u20132001. In \n2002,  PFC  plans  to  add  to  the  integrated  system  functions  of  financial  planning,  fund \nmanagement, and asset-liability and risk management. \n \n4.  PFC's  operational  philosophy  and  procedures  are  guided  by  its  Operational  Policy \nStatement (OPS). Developed in 1990 in close consultation with ADB and the World Bank, and \nsince then revised to reflect recent changes in the India power sector, the OPS provides a \n                                                 \n1  This is limited by the sovereign rating for the country. ", "  Appendix 5  35 \ncomprehensive  set  of  guidelines  for  power  sector  lending.  It  defines  PFC's  mission  and \nobjectives and sets out guidelines  for project  identification, eligibility, lending modalities, \nexposure limits, guarantees and security, and project administration including procurement \nprocedures. It also specifies limits for key financial parameters such as debt-equity ratio and \ndebt service coverage ratio to ensure PFC\u2019s own financial health while lending to others. The \nkey features of the revised OPS are (i) emphasis on power sector reforms in addition to project-\nbased lending; (ii) provision of other services such as consulting and advisory services, foreign \nexchange management, and lender's engineering services; and (iii) assistance to private sector \nprojects. A summary of the OPS is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n5.  The objectives set out in the OPS have been incorporated into PFC's latest corporate \nplan: The Corporate Strategic Plan, 2007. The plan includes projections for the 9th five-year \nplan (FY1997\u20132002), and the 10th five-year plan (FY2002\u20132007), and recommendations for a \npossible approach to the 11th five-year plan (FY2007\u20132012). The corporate plan also includes \nthe recommendations of a high-level committee on financial operations of PFC. Some of the \nrecommendations of that committee are to (i) increase PFC's investments in public sector power \nprojects by up to 20% of the total requirements and in private sector projects by up to 5% and \n(ii) reach a compound annual growth rate of 30\u201335% in terms of disbursements and loan \napprovals. \n \n6.  According to the 15th Electric Power Survey, about 72,500 MW of new generating \ncapacity is required to be added during the 10th five-year plan (FY2002\u20132007). Taking into \naccount  the  associated  investments  in  transmission  and  distribution,  the  total  investment \nrequirements  during  the  10th  plan  are  indicated  in  Table  A5.1  below.  PFC\u2019s  planned \ndisbursements to support this development program are also indicated. \n \nTable A5.1: Total Sector Investment Needs and Power Finance Corporation Share \n \n    Year  Capacity Addition  Total Investments    PFC Share \n        (MW)   (Rs billion)    (Rs billion) \n  2003  12,500  700  46 \n  2004  13,500  756  52 \n  2005  14,500  812  95 \n  2006  15,500  868  110 \n  2007  16,500  924  130 \n  Total  72,500  4,060  433 \nMW = megawatts. \nSource: Power Finance Corporation. Corporate Strategic Plan 2007. \n \n7.  Given the chronic shortage in energy and peak power capacity in India, the assumed \ncapacity addition appears to be reasonable. However, PFC's ability to finance its share of the \ninvestments, indicated in Table A5.1, will depend on its ability to raise funds. For this purpose, \nPFC expects to access provident funds, pension funds, and long-term operation funds, in \naddition to funds available under various government initiatives and from multilateral agencies. \nComplementary to project-based lending, PFC's corporate plan provides for supporting reforms \nand restructuring of the state power sector. It has already started promoting power sector \nreforms and restructuring of sector agencies, by providing them with technical advice and \nfinancial support. \n ", "36  Appendix 5 \n8.  Over the past 5 years, from FY1998 to FY2002, PFC\u2019s financial performance has been \non a sound level. PFC has exceeded all the financial performance targets1 agreed with the \nMinistry of Power every year for this period. Both the return on assets and the return on equity \nin FY2002 indicate adequate profitability of 5.0% and 20.4%, respectively. The debt service \ncoverage ratios (DSCRs) are also higher than the minimum 1.2 times. PFC\u2019s capital position, as \nmeasured by its risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio (CAR),2 was 25.6% in FY2002, which is \nsatisfatory by international standards.3 The financial position of PFC has stabilized for a variety \nof reasons. First, PFC continuously expanded its loan size to support growing investment needs \nof India\u2019s power sector. Second, nonperforming loans amounting to about Rs7.5 billion were \nrestructured between FY1997 and FY2000 and recovered cash generation. Consequently, PFC \nmaintained high overdue recovery rates of 97\u2013100% after FY1998. Third, funding costs have \nbeen  relatively  low  due  to  PFC\u2019s  access  to  tax-free  bonds,  tax  exemption  on  loans  to \ninfrastructure projects, and external borrowing with government guarantees.

For the next 10 years, PFC is targeting 20% average disbursement growth based \nannually on the 10th and 11th five-year plans. PFC\u2019s profitability is likely to remain acceptable \nover the near term due to the strong demand for funds from the state power sector as well as \nfrom central power utilities. Although aggressive expansion of the loan portfolio will result in a \ngradual  decline  of  capital  position  and  profitability  on  its  assets,  PFC  is  still  expected to \ndemonstrate sound financial performance. However, it should be noted that PFC\u2019s financial \nposition will be depend on its internal risk control. First, PFC will be exposed to more market \n                                                 \n1  At the end of every financial year, PFC and MOP prepare a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to set financial \ntargets, e.g., sanctions, disbursements, collection, return on assets, return on equity, operating ratio.  \n2  The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is the ratio of total qualified capital (equity [Tier I] plus mezzanine capital [Tier II, \nIII]) to total risk-weighted assets including off-balance sheet items. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulates the \nrequirements and standards based on types of financial institutions. However, PFC has been exempted from the \nrequirements. Accordingly, the calculation of CAR is based on RBI norms for nonbanking financial companies. \nWhen CAR was calculated on the two standard norms, RBI and BIS, the difference between the two values was \nless than 0.5% for FY2002. \n3  The Basel Accord of the Bank for International Settlements recommends a mandatory CAR of 8% for banks in \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. For most DMCs, the guidelines recommend \na minimum CAR of 12%.

Second, in the event that interest yields will be lower due to the competitive \nfinancial market in near term, PFC\u2019s other revenue sources besides the intermediary service are \nlikely to be limited.5 Furthermore, PFC\u2019s profitability might be eroded by the deterioration in the \nquality of the SEB loan portfolio. Therefore, over the long term, PFC will be required to conduct \ntimely risk control and thorough asset-liability management justified by an increase in the stable \nfunding base at acceptable costs as well as by profit opportunities. A summary of PFC\u2019s \nprojected financial performance is given in Table A5.3. Assumptions made in preparing the \nfinancial projections are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nTable A5.3.

As of 31 March 2002, PFC had 424 ongoing loans. In FY2002, 164 new loans totaling \nRs66 billion  ($1.375  billion)  to  43  borrowers  were  approved  and  disbursements  totaling \nRs52 billion ($1.083 billion) were made during the same period. As a result, PFC\u2019s loans \noutstanding in FY2002 amounted to Rs165 billion ($3.437 billion). More than 95% of PFC\u2019s \nloans outstanding have been lent to public power sector, consisting mainly of SEBs and state \ngovernments. In FY1999, PFC started lending to private sector clients; however, disbursement \nto this sector has been decreasing recently. The largest five borrowers are public sector utilities \nwhose loans exceeded 1.4 times PFC\u2019s equity in FY2002.  Accordingly, PFC\u2019s loan portfolio \nquality is exposed largely to financial conditions of public sector clients. Considering the current \nunstable financial situation of these SEBs, it is essential that PFC appropriately assess its asset \nquality, provisioning, and income recognition. As for income recognition, PFC accounts for its \ninterest revenues on an actual cash basis in a conservative manner. However, PFC has not \nidentified asset quality and its provisions in past years because it has been exempted from \nIndia\u2019s financial regulations applicable to these aspects. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines, \ncalled the prudential norms, regulate assets into four classes: standard, substandard, doubtful, \nand loss assets, based on the length of time the loan has been overdue. According to the RBI \nstandards, PFC\u2019s nonperforming assets (NPAs) in FY2002 would be 4.4% substandard only. \nThis portion of NPAs is now small enough to be fully covered by PFC\u2019s reserves for bad and \ndoubtful debts, but PFC is required to establish its own policy norms for asset quality control \nand its provisioning to cushion the credit risk, such as default by large SEB borrowers. Over the \n                                                 \n4  Government support, in the form of direct loans or tax-free bonds, has substantially declined over the years [e.g., \n58% (FY1999) to 15% (FY2002)]. Particularly, the Government has made no direct loans since FY2001. There are \nno other explicit subsidies involved in PFC\u2019s lending operations. \n5  Besides its core lending business, PFC has been starting fee-based services, such as engineering consultancy \nservices. ", "38  Appendix 5 \npast 5 years, the actual size of NPAs as per BIS norms6 has been the same as per RBI norms \nas indicated in Table A5.3. However, ADB will re-assess PFC\u2019s future NPAs based on both the \nIndian and the International asset classification norms on a regular basis to monitor portfolio \nquality and provisioning. \n \n11.  As  per  the  OPS,  PFC\u2019s  relending  rates  are  determined  based  on  cost  of  raising \nresources and the state of the financial markets without breaching the operational policy or any \nother covenanted agreements. In the past, the indicated rates were higher than prime lending \nrates or medium-term lending rates in India. However, recent rates have been competitive \ncompared to the market rates. These competitive interest rates from FY2001 stem from cheaper \nfunding due to the recent improvement in PFC\u2019s borrowing ability from the market, rather than \ndue to government support,7 which is currently decreasing. PFC has set different lending rates \nfor different type of borrowers or projects. In addition, starting in June 2002, PFC has offered \nmore  competitive  rates  of  12.0\u201312.5%  (including  0.5%  rebate  for  timely  repayment)  for \nreforming states, and further market driven rates of 11.0\u201312.0% (including 0.5%  rebate for \ntimely repayment) for states with no default declaration as of August 2002. \n \nTable A5.4.

PFC\u2019s  a  accounting  records  has  been  properly  maintained.  They  are  reviewed  by \nqualified and statutory external auditors8 appointed by the  Government . PFC also has an \ninternal audit system that appears to be broadly commensurate with the size and nature of its \nbusiness.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6  The definition of NPAs is based on length of overdue. RBI norms are less stringent than Bank for International \nSettlements norms. As per RBI asset classification, substandard: more than 6 months and less than 24 months, \ndoubtful: more than 24 months, loss: identified by auditors, RBI, or the financial institutions; as per BIS asset \nclassification, substandard: more than 3 months and less than 6 months, doubtful: more than 6 months and less \nthan 12 months, loss: more than 12 months.  \n7  For FY2002, the benefit from tax-free or government-guaranteed bonds and loans amounted  to only 0.2%, \ncompared to the average lending rate of 12.5%. \n8  The  recent  minor  qualifications  by  auditors  in  FY2002  have  been  resolved.  The  qualifications  were \n(i) understatement of Rs1.5 crore profit, consequent to the change in accounting policy in respect of provision for \nleave encashment, and (ii) an excess future claim from the Government with respect to the interest subsidy fund \naccount.

The subprojects selected for financing will be limited to category B or C projects.1 To the \nextent possible, to minimize impacts, the Power  Finance Corporation Limited (PFC) and the \nstate electricity boards (SEBs) will select subprojects that acquire (i) government land free of \nencumbrances and (ii) select land that is purchased on the principle of a \u201cwilling buyer/willing \nseller\u201d and will not entail acquisition through expropriation. PFC will appraise the subprojects in \nterms of land acquisition and resettlement and will complete screening forms to identify the \nresettlement impacts for the subprojects to evaluate them. The screening forms have been sent \nto PFC and are attached to the framework. For transmission lines, either designs should permit \ncultivation, or land compensation, crop compensation, and compensation for loss of trees will be \npaid. For nonprotected right-of-way acquisition, crop compensation and compensation for land \nacquired for transmission towers will be paid. PFC will carry out due diligence to ensure that \nsubproject selection and resettlement plan preparation meet the requirements of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) policy on involuntary resettlement.  \n \n2.  PFC will ensure that compensation is adequate to replace the lost assets, including \nlivelihood  restoration  and  related  assistance.  This  would  include  any  nontitled  persons, \nsharecroppers, tenants, and wage laborers living or carrying out livelihood activities affected by \nland acquired. Valuation that is based on compensation under the law allows for a 30% solatium \nand interest of 12% from the time of gazette notification. Valuation is based on the current \nyear\u2019s price. \n \n3.  For each subproject entailing land acquisition and resettlement, PFC will prepare short \nresettlement plans according to ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice \nand ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement.  \n \n4.  PFC will work with SEBs to ensure that resettlement plans are prepared in consultation \nwith  affected  persons  and  appropriate  grievance  redress  procedures  are  developed  and \nincluded in the resettlement plans. Consultation will be conducted by SEB staff and panchayat \n(local government)  representatives. The panchayat and SEB project officer in charge will be \nresponsible for grievance redress to ensure that any disagreements are resolved at the village \nlevel. The mechanisms will be documented in the resettlement plans. In subprojects where land \nacquisition is considered to be sensitive, PFC will be involved in the consultation process. \n \n5.  An itemized budget with mechanisms for delivery will be included in the resettlement \nplans. An implementation schedule that clearly indicates resettlement implementation, payment \nof  compensation  (at  the  time  of  possession  of  land  and  assets)  will  be  included  in  the \nresettlement plan. \n \n6.  PFC will designate staff member(s) within the Externally Aided Projects Unit (EAPU) to \nbe responsible for resettlement, including, preparation of resettlement plans and monitoring and \nevaluation of resettlement implementation. \n \n                                                 \n1  Category B projects: Short resettlement plan is required for insignificant resettlement. Resettlement is insignificant \nwhen: (i) fewer than 200 people are displaced from housing; (ii) fewer than 200 people will lose fewer than 10% of \ntheir productive assets (income generating); or (iii) 500 people or less experience minor impact. When fewer than \n100 scheduled tribes (individuals) are affected, a full indigenous peoples\u2019 development plan is not required but \nimpact and mitigation measures can be dealt through the resettlement plan. When it is category C, i.e., no \ninvoluntary resettlement effects, no resettlement plan is required.  ", "48  Appendix 11 \n7.  Arrangements for monitoring will be described in the resettlement plan. PFC will forward \nto ADB monitoring reports on land acquisition and resettlement.  \n \n8.  PFC has developed procedures for screening subprojects and preparing resettlement \nplans, in the following formats: (i) triggering actions required by PFC, (ii) initial checklist for \nresettlement impacts, (iii) screening form for initial social and poverty screening of subprojects, \nand (iv) compliance memorandum to be signed by head, EAPU. For category C projects, no \naction is required. \n \n9.  Prior  to  forwarding  the  resettlement  plans  to  ADB,  PFC  will  ensure  that  they  are \ndisclosed to the public and confirm such to ADB. The mechanisms for disclosure will be \ndiscussed in the resettlement plan. ", "  Appendix 12  49 \nENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCEDURE FOR APPROVING SUBPROJECTS  \n1.  India\u2019s Environmental Assessment Regulations \n \n1.  The type of proposed subprojects (e.g., construction of new transmission and distribution \nlines, new substations and rehabilitation of old substations, and rehabilitation and modernization \nof existing power stations) is not covered by the Indian Environmental Assessment Regulations. \nTherefore, approval from the Ministry of Forests and Environment for the environmental impact \nassessment (EIA) prior to execution of the subproject is not required.    \n \n2.  Power Finance Corporation\u2019s Environmental Assessment and Monitoring Unit \n \n2.  In 1998, the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) established procedures for incorporating \nenvironmental concerns into project design through its appraisal process. Its Environmental \nAssessment and Monitoring Unit  (EAMU) carries out environmental appraisals for projects \nfunded by PFC and formulates environmental covenants/conditions in its loan agreements if \nnecessary. EAMU is responsible for monitoring environmental performance of the projects \nthrough monthly progress reports. If the project executing agency does not meet the loan \nconditions,  PFC,  through  EAMU,  takes  necessary  action  to  help  the  agency  meet  the \nenvironmental  loan  conditions.  However,  if  the  agency  does  not  meet  the  requirements \nthereafter, loan disbursements are suspended until the problems are resolved. The EAMU \npresently has two qualified environment officers with environmental backgrounds. A one-day \ntraining workshop to familiarize EAMU staff and PFC\u2019s other staff with ADB\u2019s  Environment \nPolicy and Environmental Assessment Guidelines was conducted during the appraisal mission.  \n \n3.  Environmental Requirements \n   \n3.  New transmission lines, distribution lines that pass through ecologically sensitive areas, \nnew substations, rehabilitation of existing substations, and rehabilitation and modernization of \nexisting power generation plants that potentially could affect environmental quality will require \nan initial environmental examination (IEE) prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s environmental \nguidelines. \n \n4.   Review Procedures \n \n4.  The following review procedure is adopted to facilitate environmental screening and \nmonitoring: \n \nProponent/SEB responsibilities: \n \n\u00a7 Fill up the environmental checklist; and \n\u00a7 Prepare IEE. \n \nPFC (through EAMU) responsibilities: \n \n\u00a7 Ensure that the proponent/SEB submit environmental checklist for each project; \n\u00a7 Review the filled up checklist;  \n\u00a7 Request proponent to prepare IEE;  \n\u00a7 Review the IEE report; and \n\u00a7 Participate in the appraisal team and ensure that all necessary environmental \nconditions are incorporated into the loan document.  \n  ", "50  Appendix 12 \nADB responsibilities: \n \n\u00a7 Review IEE reports for proposed subprojects where the capital cost is more than \n$10 million;1 \n\u00a7 Review the IEE for subprojects that have significant environmental impacts; and \n\u00a7 Provide environmental approval and propose related loan conditionalities for PFC \nto incorporate in its loan documents, within 2 weeks. \n \n5.   Public Disclosure \n \n5.  In all of these above actions, EAMU is responsible for ensuring that all environmental \ndocumentations (environmental checklist, IEE report) are properly kept as part of the loan \ndocumentation. \n \n6.  All  environmental  documents  are  subject  to  public  disclosure;  therefore,  these \ndocuments should be made available to the public if requested. \n \n6.   Environmental Due Diligence to Ensure with ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines and \nEnvironment Policy \n \n7.  ADB  should  be  given  access  to  undertake  environmental  due  diligence  for  all \nsubprojects, if needed. However, PFC has the sole responsibility for undertaking environmental \ndue diligence and monitoring the implementation of environmental mitigation measures for all \nsubprojects. \n \n                                                 \n \n1  This capital limit will be reviewed 1 year after the Project is effectively implemented.

Introduction \n \n1.  The proposed investment components under the Power Finance Corporation Limited \n(PFC)  project  will  involve  the  establishment  of  transmission  and  distribution  lines  and \nsubstations as well as rehabilitation and modernization of existing power stations. These types \nof projects are categorized as \u201cB\u201d projects in accordance with  the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Environmental Assessment Requirements. The initial environmental examinations (IEEs) \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Requirements  for  two  sample \ninvestments  were  prepared  by  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  and  summarized below. This \nappendix is based on the information in the IEEs for the sample investment components. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The sample subprojects represent rehabilitation and expansion of transmission lines and \nsubstations,  as  well  as  expansion  of  a  distribution  system  which  will  involve  activities \nsummarized in Table A13.  \n \nTable A13. Description of Subproject Activities \n \nNo.  Subprojects  Activities \n 1  Jhargram 132/33V transmission line and  q The expansion of transmission will include \nsubstation in West Midnapore District, West  construction of 45 km double circuit 132  \nBengal  transmission line and 149 towers. The \nphysical components will involve construction \nof transmission line from the existing 132 \nMidnapr substation to 132/33  switching \nstation at Jargham. \nq Installation of transformers, circuit breaker, \nand lightning arrestors.  \nq Civil work for establishment of 132/33  \nsubstation with total area cover 1200 sq \nmeter \n2  Improvement of Distribution System in  q Construction of single distribution line, \nAurangabad City, MaharasthaMaharashtra  medium and low voltage  (33 and 11 kV) \nq Installation of 200 kV and 315 kV \ntransformers \nq Civil works for establishing 33/11 kV \nsubstation  \nq Construction of 3.7-kilometer (km) low \nvoltage distribution line of 230 volts (V) \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n3.  The environmental condition of the subproject briefly summarized as follows: \n \ni.  Jhargram  132/33 kV  transmission  line  and  substation  in  West \nMidnapore  District,  West  Bengal.    The  proposed  alignment  of  the \ntransmission lines will pass through agricultural fields, transverse some \nsmall rivers, home gardens, and some settlement areas. The topography \nof the project area is basically flat with some area having gently slope. ", "  Appendix 13  57 \nThe  nearest  forest  is  located  about  2 km  from  the  alignment  of \ntransmission line in Western Midnapore. The line does not pass through \nforest, wildlife sanctuary, and national park. It does not pass also any \nsocial  infrastructures  (e.g.,  schools,  medical  clinic,  and  cultural  or \nhistorical importance).  The proposed substation is located in Jhargram \nsubdivision,  which  is  about  170 km  from  Kolkata.  The  town  is  well \nconnected by railway and roads. \nii.  Aurangabad.  The  distribution  system  will  serve  the  Aurangabad  city \narea. The proposed substations will also located in the city area. There is \nno environmentally sensitive area nearby this city. \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n4.  The  screening  of  potential  impacts  identifies  that  there  will  be  no  significant \nenvironmental impact arising from the siting of the transmission and distribution lines and the \nsubstations, because none of them is located nearby or within any environmentally sensitive \narea. \n  \n5.  The environmental impacts associated with the construction stage will be mainly related \nto  land  clearing  activities  and  excavation  of  land  to  place  the  tower  foundations.  The \ntransmission line  (132 kV) and medium voltage distribution line (33 kV) will require clearing of a \nright-of-way across about 10\u201320 meters (m). No land clearing will be required for low voltage \ndistribution lines (11 kV). Concrete poles of 10\u201311 m high will be erected at distance not greater \nthan 40\u201350 m.  Each poles will require land of 9\u201325 square meters. While, the low voltage \ndistribution line (230 V) will not require a special right-of-way, and it does not require also a \nconcrete pole. The poles will be about 8 m height and using wood. Therefore, the impacts \nassociated  with  the  laying  of  the  distribution  line  will  be  very  minimal  and  the  mitigation \nmeasures will be manageable. The impacts associated with the construction of the transmission \nline will also be minimal because the activities will be carried out as much as possible by using \nthe existing motorable roads. If temporary roads are needed, the contractor will be required to \nemploy good construction practices by maintaining the topsoil and rehabilitating temporary \nroads if the communities living nearby the project area do not want these temporary roads.    \n \n6.  The  environmental  impacts  associated  with  the  operation  would  not  be  significant, \nbecause the activities during the operation will involve only maintaining clearance from tree \nbranches and leaves, not exceeding 3 m in height. Noise is the only impact associated with \nsubstation operation.  \n \n7.  The  proposed  mitigation  measures  will  involve:  (i) select  a  route  for  alignment  to \nminimize the number of trees to be removed; (ii) avoid cultural and historical monuments, public \nutility  services  (e.g.,  playground,  school),  and  any  environmentally  sensitive  areas;  and \n(iii) locate the transformers at a reasonable distance so that noise levels from the fencing should \nmeet Indian national standards.  \n ", "58  Appendix 13 \n8.  The following guidelines for transmission lines and tower spotting will be observed: \n \n  (i)  The alignment will avoid, without exception, known wildlife reserves, closed (or \nold-growth) forests, archaeological sites, religious structures, and educational \ninstitutions. \n  (ii)  As far as practicable, the alignment will avoid agricultural estates and houses \n(permanent or temporary). In particular, special care will be taken to avoid human \nsettlement  clusters.  Where  agricultural  estates  are  unavoidable,  the  ground \nclearance will be increased to at least 10 m. \n  (iii)  Where road or river crossing is unavoidable, prescribed vertical and horizontal \nclearance requirements will be strictly adhered to. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n9.  The state electricity board will take full responsibility for implementing the environmental \nmanagement plan and for ensuring that the Project complies with best environmental practices \nand meets mitigation and monitoring requirements described in the IEE reports. The contractor \nwill take responsibility for implementing all mitigation measures during the construction stage. \nThe PFC will randomly monitor the implementation of the mitigation measures, which include \ncross-checking the contract and bidding document, if necessary, to ensure that the contractor \nwill be bound by the responsibility to implement the mitigation measures. For the transmission \ncomponent that passes though any sensitive area, which is subject to government regulations, \nthe state electricity board will ensure that no contract for civil work will be awarded prior to \napproval from the relevant institutions.  \n \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n10.  Overall environmental impacts are deemed to be minor. Therefore an environmental \nimpact assessment is unnecessary. It is recommended that project implementation should \nstrictly adhere to proposed mitigation measures stated in the IEE reports.  \n \nG.  Conclusion \n \n11.  The adverse environmental impacts of the project will be minor. The IEE is therefore \nconsidered adequate.  \n \n  "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R302-02_Cover - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20021121161637Z", "Title": "State Power Sector Reform Project - India", "Author": "ADB", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 4.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20040305095824+08'00'"}}
