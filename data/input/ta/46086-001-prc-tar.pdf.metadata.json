INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) to help \nimprove the country\u2019s agricultural logistics systems. The TA was included in ADB\u2019s PRC country \noperations business plan for 2012\u20132014.1 The TA, which is designed to contribute to balanced \nand sustainable development, improved rural incomes, and inclusive growth, is consistent with \nADB\u2019s PRC country partnership strategy for 2011\u20132015,2 and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.3 In March \n2012, an ADB mission reached an agreement with the government that the TA will include a \nnational component supporting improved agricultural logistics in the PRC, with a provincial \ncomponent in Jiangxi province as a pilot. During the mission and subsequent discussions, an \nunderstanding  was  reached  on  the  project  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services. \nThe TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Logistics inefficiencies in the agricultural sector are among the main factors causing low \nreturns to farmers, high and volatile food prices, and degraded quality of food supplies in PRC. \nAs reflected in the 12th Five-Year Plan,5 the government has identified improved agricultural \nlogistics  as  vital  to  reducing  rural\u2013urban  income  disparities  and  improving  food  security. \nImproved agricultural logistics are also critical for strengthening the competitiveness of the \noverall agriculture sector and expanding domestic consumption.   \n \n3.  Improved  agriculture  logistics  are  particularly  important  with  regard  to  perishable \nagricultural products. As much as 30% of fruit and vegetable production is lost due to spoilage \nduring transportation, storage, and wholesale and retail activities. To compensate for spoilage, \nfarmers rely heavily on chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and other inputs to raise crop yields. \nFurthermore, expansion of the middle-income class and increasing urbanization are resulting in \ngrowing demand for perishable agricultural products of high quality and value, placing additional \npressure  on  agricultural  logistics.  Internationally,  the  agriculture  sector  tends  to  follow  the \nexample of manufacturing industries in the formation of tightly aligned value chains. Such value \nchains help improve efficiency; reduce risks related to quality, quantity and food safety; and are \nmore responsive to consumer demands. Logistics is a vital dimension of the value chain.  \n  \n4.  Recognizing the need for a modern logistics system for the agricultural sector, the State \nCouncil issued a plan6 to guide development of the logistics industry in 2009. The plan calls for \ncreating a supportive regulatory environment, extensive infrastructure investment, establishing \ntechnical standards, promoting integration of logistics processes, reducing barriers to trade and \npromoting competition. As part of the effort to implement the plan, in June 2010 the National \nDevelopment and Reform Committee prepared a development plan (for 2010\u20132015) for cold \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012.

Beijing. \n ", "2   \nchain logistics for agricultural products.7 Given the PRC\u2019s size and agricultural needs, the task \nof achieving greater efficiency in logistics for the agriculture sector is a huge challenge, which \nwill be met largely by the business sector. The government\u2019s role is to support business-led \ninitiatives through provision of (i) an enabling policy, regulatory, and institutional environment; \nand (ii) public infrastructure components of the supply and demand chain.   \n \n5.  The  setting  of  appropriate  standards  is  a  basic  step  toward  providing  an  enabling \nregulatory framework. The lack of comprehensive and consistent national standards on product \nhandling,  processing,  packaging,  shipping,  storage,  delivery,  and  certification  is  a  serious \nimpediment to the development of cold chain logistics for perishable agricultural products, and \nvalue chain formation generally. Without comprehensive and consistent standards, it is difficult \nto coordinate the value chain through contracts and reduce risk related to the quality and safety \nof perishables. Many government departments at both the central and local levels currently \nshare  responsibility  for  the  setting  and  enforcement  of  relevant  standards.  In  addition  to \nimproved coordination of these government departments, other key stakeholders in the cold \nchain\u2014including  farmers,  manufacturers  of  logistics  equipment,  logistics  service  providers, \ndistributors,  and  retailers\u2014should  be  involved  to  ensure  standards  are  appropriate  and \nenforceable, as they will need to adopt new technologies and international best practices to \nmeet the proposed standards. \n \n6.  Policy measures are also needed to promote development and growth of the agriculture \nlogistics industry in the PRC, which is characterized by lack of integration of logistics processes, \nunderdevelopment of third-party logistics, and a large number of small businesses operating on \na limited scale. Structural changes such as industry consolidation and entry of large-scale third-\nparty logistics service providers will help improve integration of the supply chain and lead to \neconomies of scale.  However, it is important to guard against monopolies or oligopolies and \npromote  competition  by  encouraging  entry  of  private  capital  and  helping  existing  small \nbusinesses better position themselves in the industry. \n \n7.  ADB has provided a range of support to strengthen agriculture value chains, including \nlogistics, in developing member countries. Logistics issues in Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia were \nevaluated under the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation program in 2008; a regional \nTA approved in 2009 examined obstacles to cross-border trade on the PRC\u2013Mongolia and \nPRC\u2013Viet Nam borders;8 several agricultural projects were supported in Gansu, Henan, Shanxi, \nand Shandong provinces following the value chain approach to enhance synergy and value \naddition.9 Lessons from these projects have included the need to greatly improve the efficiency \nof logistics systems in the country and strengthen related policies and regulations. ADB is \npreparing a private sector investment project in Tianjin to increase cold chain logistics capacity10. \n                                                \n7  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, National Development and Reform Committee. 2010.

The  project  is  scheduled  for  Board  consideration  in \nSeptember 2012. \n ", "  3 \nBuilding on past and ongoing ADB projects, the TA will focus on improving the regulatory and \npolicy framework at the national level, in support of logistics systems for perishable agricultural \nproducts in the PRC.  \n \n8.  At the provincial level, Jiangxi province has been selected as a pilot for two primary \nreasons.  First,  agriculture  is  an  important  sector  in  the  province  and  the  government  is \ncommitted to improving agricultural logistics systems. About 38% of the labor force depends on \nagriculture and the province accounts for a substantial share of the PRC\u2019s production of grain, \npork,  edible  oil,  vegetable,  and  hydroponic  products.  In  its  12th  Five-Year  Plan,11 Jiangxi \nprovincial  government  identified  modernization  of  agriculture  as  a development  priority;  an \nimproved agricultural logistics system is one of the key factors for modernizing the sector. Under \nan earlier TA, key agricultural logistics problems were identified and measures to develop an \neffective agricultural logistics system  were recommended as part of the rural development \nstrategy for Jiangxi province.12 The province is now formulating plans to invest in logistics \ninfrastructure as part of the effort to achieve the goals included in its 12th Five-Year Plan. \nSecond, Jiangxi is a low income province in which poor rural households will benefit from a well \nestablished logistics system. More than 8% of the rural population lives under the national \npoverty line and 21 counties are designated for national poverty alleviation assistance.  \n \n9.  The  TA  will  help  Jiangxi  province  prepare  a  development  plan  for  improving  its \nagriculture logistics systems and identifying related investment priorities under the guidance of \nthe national framework. Jiangxi province will serve as a case study for low-income agricultural \nprovinces to showcase the benefits of an improved agricultural logistics system. Lessons and \nknowledge developed from the TA will be applied to improve agricultural logistics systems in \nother provinces. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA will contribute to the development of agricultural logistics systems in the PRC, \nboth at a national level and in Jiangxi province on a pilot basis. The impact will be improved \nagricultural logistics systems in the PRC and Jiangxi province. The outcome will be an improved \npolicy  and  regulatory  framework  in  support  of  cold  chain  logistics  systems  for  perishable \nagricultural products in the PRC and improved agricultural logistics planning in Jiangxi province. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.   For the national component, the TA will follow the value chain approach and carry out \nbusiness process analyses (BPAs) of the value chain, focusing on product flow features. The \nefficiency  of  each  chain  segment  will  be  assessed;  and  bottlenecks  and  requirements  for \nstandards will be identified through site visits, interviews with value chain participants, and on-\nthe-spot tracking of product flow. For the provincial component, a framework will be used that \ncombines  economic  geography  and  value  chain  analysis,  focusing  on  three  or  four  main \nagricultural products of the province. In addition to conducting business process analyses as in \n                                                \n11  Government of Jiangxi Province, People\u2019s Republic of China. 2011.

Jiangxi Rural Development Strategy, report under TA 7036-PRC: Provincial Development Strategies \nfor Selected Provinces in the Central Region. Some recommendations as part of the rural development strategy for \nJiangxi province are incorporated in the proposed TA activities, including development of agricultural logistics \ninfrastructure and information platforms. \n ", "4   \nthe national component, surveys on logistics costs will be done for the selected agricultural \nvalue chains. Further, for both components, consultations will be held with relevant government \ndepartments, key private enterprises operating in the agricultural logistics sector, and trade \nassociations.  \n \n12.  Output 1: Policy and regulatory recommendations to improve PRC\u2019s cold chain \nlogistic systems. The policy and regulatory recommendations will address the need for cold \nchain logistics standards and policy measures to facilitate development of cold chain logistics \nfor perishable agricultural products. First, the TA will outline key elements of required cold chain \nlogistics standards for selected perishable agricultural products and ways to harmonize existing \nstandards.  Technical  standards  on  temperature  control  during  transportation,  storage, \ndistribution,  and  retailing  need  to  be  established  and  harmonized  so  that  supply  chain \ncapabilities can be established to meet these standards. Rules and regulations on validation of \ncold chains and product accreditation should follow international standards. Second, the TA will \nrecommend policies to promote development and growth of the cold chain logistics industry for \nperishable  agricultural  products  and  adoption  of  new  technologies  and  international  best \npractices among logistics service providers. Economic instruments such as tax incentives and \ninnovative supply chain financing will be reviewed as part of the effort to promote private sector \ninvestment. The reduction of barriers to interprovincial trade and streamlining of regulatory \nprocesses and competition policies will be recommended to improve the business environment \nand guard against anticompetitive business practices.  \n \n13.  Output 2: Agricultural logistics development plan for Jiangxi province. The TA will \n(i) identify value chain participants; (ii) map distribution flows, including transportation routes and \nmodes, and existing and potential markets in Jiangxi and nearby provinces; (iii) identify required \nlogistics  infrastructure  and  associated  services;  (iv)  propose  regulations  and  standards  for \nagricultural logistics consistent with those recommended under the national component of the \nTA; and (v) prepare guidelines for information platforms serving farmers, logistics providers, and \ndistributers. The TA will also analyze the distribution impact of agricultural logistics development \nin  the  province  and  provide  recommendations  on  ensuring  inclusive  growth  of  the  sector, \nespecially for farmers and smallholders in the value chain. \n \n14.  Output 3: Knowledge product. The knowledge product will evaluate the efficiency and \neffectiveness of the PRC\u2019s  cold chain logistics system for perishable agricultural products, \noutline policy recommendations on establishing standards, and formulating industry policies and \ncompetition policies to facilitate sector development.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000, of which $900,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of (i) counterpart staff remuneration and travel expenses; \n(ii) logistics support in arranging workshops and study tours; (iii) fully functional office space for \nconsultants with water and utility supply, a telephone line, and free access to the internet and \nphotocopying; and (iv) provision of basic data and related studies for consultants\u2019 use. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  For the national component, the Development Research Center (DRC) of the State \nCouncil will be the executing agency, headed by the vice president of DRC. The executing \n ", "  5 \nagency  will  provide  policy  and  strategy  guidance  during  the  TA  implementation.  The \nInternational Cooperation Department of DRC (ICD-DRC) will be the implementing agency. A \nTA management office (TMO) will be established in ICD-DRC, headed by the director.  For the \nprovincial  component,  the  Jiangxi  Provincial  Agricultural  Department  (JPAD)  will  be  the \nexecuting  agency,  providing strategy  and  policy  guidance  during TA  implementation.  The \nJiangxi Provincial Rural Social Development Bureau (JPRSDB) will be the implementing agency. \nThe  provincial  component  will  be  partially  delegated  to  the  JPAD  according  to  the  terms \nstipulated in the memorandum of understanding on delegated TA projects between the PRC \nand ADB.13 The procurement capacities of the JPAD and the JPRSDB were assessed in June \n2012, and the executing and implementing agencies of the provincial component were found to \nhave sufficient resources and satisfactory procurement and oversight procedures to implement \nthe TA. A TMO will be established in JPRSDB, with the deputy director of JPRSDB as head of \nthe TMO.  \n \n17.  The respective TMOs will carry out day-to-day activities under the TA and ensure active \nparticipation and inputs from relevant government departments, trade associations, and the \nprivate  sector.  The  TMOs  will  also  administer  workshops,  study  tours,  and  field  studies. \nAdvance payment facilities  will be set up within the TMOs, subject to the  capacity of the \nexecuting agencies to complete the activities and liquidate advance payments according to \nADB\u2019s procedures. ICD-DRC and JPRSDB will (i) communicate regularly to share research \nfindings and lessons; and (ii) endeavor to coordinate project activities, such as workshops and \nstudy tours.   \n \n18.  The  TA  is  tentatively  scheduled  to  be  implemented  from  1  October  2012  to  30 \nSeptember 2013. The TA activities will be undertaken by two consulting firms. The consulting \nfirm for the national component is required to provide a total of 35 person-months of consulting \nservices, with two international consultants (8 person-months) and three national consultants \n(27 person-months). The consulting firm will be engaged by ADB. The consulting firm for the \nprovincial component is required to provide a total of 43 person-months of consulting services, \nwith one international consultant (5 person-months) and four national consultants (38 person-\nmonths). The consulting firm will be engaged by JPAD. The consulting firms will be engaged \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) \nusing the quality- and cost-based selection criteria, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. For the \nJiangxi  province  component,  equipment  will  be  procured  by  the  TMO  following  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements will follow ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (May 2010, as amended from time to time). \nUpon TA completion, the equipment will be turned over to JPRSDB. The TA findings and \noutputs, including the knowledge product, will be presented during the workshops and posted \non the respective websites of ADB and the executing agencies, to share information  with \nnational and international stakeholders.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China for Logistics System Development for Agricultural Products, and \n \nhereby reports this action to the Board.\n                                                \n13  Following an \u2015enhanced partnership\u2016 model, JPAD, the executing agency for the provincial component, will \nundertake selected recruitment and implementation activities as outlined in the memorandum of understanding on \nenhanced partnership on technical assistance delegation to the executing agency.
