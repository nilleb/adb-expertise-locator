THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will support the development of climate-\nresilient solutions and efficient project implementation in the agriculture, natural resources, and \nrural development (ANR) sector in Pakistan. The TA facility will help ensure projects are grounded \nin strategic sector and climate change assessments, respond to the specific needs of women \nworking in agriculture, have a high level of procurement and safeguards readiness, and provide \ninnovative and integrated solutions. This will be achieved through a combination of upstream \nanalytical work, project processing and readiness support, policy advisory and capacity building, \nand implementation support. The support will be focused on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab \nprovinces, primary areas of Asian Development Bank (ADB) activities in the sector (Appendix 1). \nThis TA facility consolidates planned stand-alone transaction TAs identified in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan for Pakistan, 2021\u20122023.1 \n \n2.  Sector challenges. The ANR sector in Pakistan requires holistic and strategic solutions \nto modernize its infrastructure, management, and value chains. This is to ensure it can deliver \nadequate food and livelihoods for a growing population and competing demands for finite natural \nresources within an increasingly variable climate. Agriculture\u2019s share in the country\u2019s gross \ndomestic product has declined from 30% in 1985 to about 19% in 2019.2 The sector still employs \nabout 40% of the total labor force. It is a primary source of livelihoods particularly for the rural \npoor and women.3 Agriculture yield and productivity per unit of water is below global and regional \naverages. This is because of growing scarcity of reliable, good quality water supply; land \ndegradation, and mismanagement of agricultural production and water resources.4 Irrigation \nsystem water requirements have increased because of rising cropping intensities and high water-\nconsuming crops. This is exacerbated by low irrigation efficiency of about 40%. Surface water \navailability has remained largely unchanged since the 1970s. Expansion and intensification of \nagriculture has been made possible by unsustainable and unregulated groundwater extraction \n(footnote 4). \n  \n3.  Climate change. Climate risks are to be considered for future investments. There is \notherwise a risk that projects will not achieve intended development outcomes, deplete limited \ngovernment resources, or be detrimental to beneficiaries. Pakistan consistently ranks among \ncountries most vulnerable to climate change and most adversely affected by extreme weather \nevents.5 Much of the population, particularly those in the rural areas, is highly exposed and \ndependent on weather-related inputs. Emerging and rising climate-related risks to the ANR sector \ninclude extreme heat events, increased evapotranspiration and water requirements, intense \nprecipitation and flood events, uncertain future water flows, and drought.6 In the absence of \nadequate adaptation, yield declines in many key crops are also predicted. The Government of \nPakistan\u2019s  Nationally  Determined  Contribution  (NDC)  to  the  Paris  Agreement  prioritizes \naddressing the climate change vulnerabilities of water, agriculture, and infrastructure (including \nirrigation systems). It identifies an estimated adaptation financing requirement of $7 billion\u2013$14 \n \n1  ADB. 2021. Country Operations Business Plan: Pakistan, 2021\u20132023. Manila. \n2  Gross domestic product.

Gender. Around three-quarters of women in the labor force in Pakistan work in the \nagriculture sector. Although women in Pakistan have statutory rights to own land, customary \npractices limit their access to land. Only 1%\u20132% of women individually own land and about 10% \nhave joint ownership with their spouses, but with little effective control over land despite strong \ninvolvement and understanding of needs, women have limited voice.Poor access to land and \n \nlimited  engagement  in  economic  activities  are  detrimental  to  rural  women\u2019s  agricultural \nproductivity. Women and children are disproportionately affected by disasters caused by natural \nhazards, including those likely to be exacerbated by climate change. The TA facility will support \ngender-inclusive  stakeholder  engagement  to  plan  and  design  projects  that  will  strengthen \nwomen\u2019s access to decision making, address existing gender norms that create barriers to their \nparticipation in ANR, and create opportunities for women to gain skills. This includes gender-\ninclusive capacity building for agriculture production and climate risk management, and improved \nagriculture services and community facilities. \n \n5.  Government  priorities.  The  TA  facility  will  support  the  national  and  provincial \ndevelopment priorities for the agriculture and natural resources sector. These include Pakistan \nVision 2025, Pakistan\u2019s National Water Policy (2018), provincial water policies and acts, and NDC \nto the Paris Agreement (footnote 7), the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Integrated Water Resources \nManagement Strategy, the respective Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab draft climate change \npolicies.8 The Government of Punjab\u2019s Growth Strategy 2023 prioritizes adapting to climate \nchange,  water  availability,  agricultural  productivity,  and  sustainable  water  resources \nmanagement.9 The key strategic sector objectives of the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s \nmedium-term development framework for 2019\u20132023 are improved water resource management \nincluding improved efficiency of irrigation water usage.10 The TA facility is aligned with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 operational priorities of (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities, \n(ii) accelerating progress in gender equality, (iii) building climate resilience, and (iv)  promoting \nrural development and food security.11 The facility directly supports pillar 2 and 3 of ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for Pakistan, 2021\u20132025 for (i) strengthening resilience to the aftermath of \nthe  COVID-19  pandemic  on  the  rural  economy,  climate  change  adaptation  and  reducing \neconomic  and  social  vulnerabilities;  and  (ii)  investing  in  value  chain  rural  infrastructure \ndevelopment.12 \n \n6.  Lessons learned. The TA facility will support a more programmatic approach to project \nprocessing and implementation. This is required to address future challenges more efficiently and \neffectively than stand-alone and discrete interventions, which may have fewer cumulative impacts. \nADB\u2019s ANR portfolio has suffered from low project readiness, delays in contract awards and \n \n7  Government  of  Pakistan.  2016.

It is also characterized by mainly stand-alone investments, \nrather  than  strategic  and  efficient  lending  modalities.13 The  ADB  Independent  Evaluation \nDepartment\u2019s (IED) recent validation report for the country partnership strategy for Pakistan, \n2015\u20132019 highlighted the need to integrate institutional development and policy advisory with \ninfrastructure investment to strengthen sustainability and transformative impact.14 The IED sector-\nwide  evaluation  of  ADB\u2019s  support  for  the  ANR  sector  recommended  more  robust  sector \ndiagnostics through increased technical assistance, and strengthening project pipelines and \nquality-at-entry  processes.  It  also  identified  expanding  focus  on  broader  water  resource \nmanagement and climate change.15 \n \n7.  Using a TA facility instead of single-project transaction TAs ensures more consistent and \nholistic support for the ANR project pipeline and associated government counterparts. It will also \nbe  more  administratively  efficient.  The  TA  facility  will  enable  more  strategic  programming \ndecisions, integrated project interventions, improved safeguards and procurement readiness, and \nstrengthening of institutions and policymaking. It will ensure project rationale and design is \nanchored in adequate upstream thematic and climate change analysis. More efficient lending \nmodalities, including multi-tranche financing facilities, can be explored. Investments can be \nsupported by associated policy advice and capacity building. Consultants can be mobilized across \nmultiple projects and counterparts, ensuring more consistent quality of deliverables and lower \ncosts. \n \n8.  Ensuing projects. The TA facility will support processing and readiness activities for three \nensuing irrigation and water resources management projects in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab \nprovinces (Table 1).16 All ensuing projects are associated with ongoing or proposed project \nreadiness financing (PRF).17 The PRFs cover (i) preparation and updating of feasibility studies; \n(ii) economic analysis, procurement risk assessment, and safeguards due diligence; (iii) gender \nand social assessment including gender action plan; (iv) detailed design; and (v) initiation of \nproject readiness and startup, such as establishing the project implementation unit, safeguards \nimplementation, and advanced procurement. The TA facility will support the PRF\u2019s quality outputs \nthrough (i) early-stage upstream stakeholder engagement, scoping, and initial assessments for \nsafeguards  and  gender  due  diligence;  and  (ii)  review  and  enhancement  by  international \nconsultants to integrate best international practices and quality solutions in the project design. \nThe TA facility will also prepare supplementary documentation and due diligence not included in \nthe  PRFs,  including  financial  management  assessments,  financial  analysis,  and  strategic \nprocurement plans. Delineation of PRF and TA facility tasks is shown in Appendix 2. \n \n \n13 Only one multi-tranche financing facility has been approved for the ANR sector in Pakistan since 2005: ADB.

Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  The TA outcome is investment projects with climate-resilient solutions prepared. \n \n10.  Output 1: Integrated climate change risk assessment prepared. The pipeline of ANR \ninvestment projects in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab will be enhanced to incorporate strategic \nplanning for climate change adaptation.18 Through a stakeholder consultation process, a strategic \nadaptation plan for the ANR sector will be prepared for each province using adaptation pathways \nand similar planning tools. Basin and sub-basin level climate change risks will be assessed, \nincorporating updated climate, hydrological, and crop modeling. Systemic climate-related risks \nwill  be  identified  beyond  the  direct  risks  to  ANR  infrastructure  and  beneficiaries,  including \nupstream and downstream transboundary impacts. A household survey will be conducted to \nidentify links between the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) impacts, climate risks, and adaptation \nopportunities.  Priority  adaptation  investments  will  be  identified  through  (i)  strengthening \nadaptation entry-points of planned projects, and (ii) developing prospective new adaptation \nprojects. Investments that effectively support a gender-inclusive resilient COVID-19 recovery \namong the most vulnerable communities will be prioritized.19 Opportunities for community-driven, \nand private sector-driven resilience investments will be explored. Results of the integrated \nassessment  support  the  project-level  climate  assessments  prepared  for  the  three  ensuing \nprojects under their respective PRFs. The TA facility will additionally prepare at least two pre-\nfeasibility studies (one each for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab) for priority new investments \nincorporating innovative adaptation measures.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Project processing and readiness enhanced. Three ensuing projects in \nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab will be prepared with modern and holistic solutions and a high \ndegree of safeguards and procurement readiness. The TA facility will support and enhance the \nactivities of the respective project PRFs to ensure quality and best practice solutions are well \nintegrated. TA facility activities are expected to include (i) support for development of project \nscope, frameworks, modalities, and approaches; (ii) review and update documents prepared \n \n18 It is intended that this would be classified as \u2018Type 2\u2019 adaptation investment projects under ADB nomenclature i.e., \nrepresenting projects predicated on climate change adaptation.

Analysis of \ngender-related issues and engagement of women will be ensured in the conduct of stakeholder consultations, sex-\ndisaggregated household survey, and development of priority investments. \n ", "5 \nunder the PRFs including feasibility study, gender assessment and plan, due diligence, detailed \ndesign, and bidding documents; (iii) conduct early-stage screening, stakeholder engagement, \nscoping, and initial assessment for safeguards and gender due diligence; (iv) prepare additional \nselected supplementary project documentation not covered under the PRFs including financial \nmanagement assessment, financial analysis, and strategic procurement plan; and (v) support \nadvanced procurement activities and early stage safeguards implementation for project readiness. \n \n12.  Output  3:  Capacity  building  and  advisory support  provided.  Strategic  planning, \npolicymaking, and project implementation will be enhanced among key government counterparts \nin the ANR sector. Selected thematic analysis and policy advisory will be provided in key ANR \nsector areas. This will include integrated river basin and sub-basin management, agriculture value \nchain  development,  groundwater  management,  agronomy,  nature-based  solutions,  and \ninstitutional development. Capacity building will be provided to government counterparts and \nstakeholders on safeguards and gender. The outputs will support gender-sensitive strategic \nplanning for future interventions and investment by identifying opportunities for best practice, high-\nlevel technology, and holistic irrigated agriculture development. Support will also be provided to \nfacilitate  efficient  project  implementation  for  project  coordination,  monitoring  and  reporting, \nprocurement, and safeguards. This includes capacity building for executing and implementing \nagencies and review of documentation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $3.09 million, of which (i) $2.25 million will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7), and (ii) $0.75 million will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund.20 The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 3.  \n \n14.  The governments of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab will provide counterpart support in \nthe form of counterpart staff, meeting facilitation, data access, and other in-kind support. The \ngovernment contribution is estimated to account for 3% of the total TASF 7 and Climate Change \nFund financing, which is $90,000. The government was informed that approval of the TA does \nnot commit ADB to finance any ensuing projects. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will coordinate and administer the TA facility. The executing agencies, the Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa Planning and Development Department and the Punjab Planning and Development \nBoard, will oversee and coordinate the facility\u2019s multi-disciplinary activities among counterparts \nand stakeholders. ADB will work closely with designated counterparts including the Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa  Agriculture  Department,  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  Irrigation  Department,  Punjab \nAgriculture Department, and Punjab Irrigation Department. These departments are anticipated to \nbe the executing or implementing agencies for the ensuing projects. The Environment, Natural \nResources, and Agriculture Division of the Central and West Asia Department will implement the \nTA facility. It will select, administer, supervise, and evaluate the consultants\u2019 outputs to be \ndelivered for the respective outputs and projects.  \n \n16.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2. The TA is rated complex.21 \n \n20 Established by ADB.

Consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants following ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated staff instructions.22 Indicative consultant \ninputs are provided in Appendix 4. Consulting firms will be recruited using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method with a 90:10 ratio of quality to cost, considering the high degree of \nspecialism required in the assignments. Consultant inputs have been balanced between firm and \nindividual inputs. This is to maximize efficiency of administration and targeting of specialist skills. \nThe approach draws from lessons learned in recent ADB TAs in Pakistan in the ANR and water \nand urban services sectors and the identified needs of the implementation agencies. Firms will \nbe used where overall scope of work is generally well defined and deliverables require the \ncoordinated input of a team. Individuals will be used when a high degree of specialism is required \nto identify innovative solutions and provide more hands-on advisory support. A firm led by an \ninternational team leader will be recruited to prepare the integrated climate change assessment \nunder output 1, to be financed by the Climate Change Fund. A second firm led by an international \nteam leader will be recruited to support irrigation and agriculture activities under output 2. A third \nfirm led by an international team leader will be recruited to support safeguards and gender \nactivities for processing and readiness under output 2 and capacity building under output 3.
