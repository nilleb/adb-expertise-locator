To support implementation of the second financial sector program loan (FSPL  II),1 the \nGovernment of Viet Nam requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical \nassistance (TA). In response to the request, ADB fielded a fact-finding mission to Hanoi from 26 \nAugust to 6 September and reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, \nscope, cost, financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA.2 The TA framework is \nin Appendix 1. Summary Initial Poverty and Social Analysis is presented as Appendix 2. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Financial Sector Issues. The current Vietnamese financial sector mirrors the country\u2019s \neconomy and is in a transitional phase. Financial sector reforms since the onset of Doi Moi3 \nhave  created  a  two-tier  banking  system,  put  the  basic  legal  framework  for  central  and \ncommercial bank operations in place and initiated the development of financial infrastructure \nsuch as a payments system and a credit information bureau. However, financial intermediation \nstill remains low, and the current structure does not fully support economic development. \nDomestic resource mobilization has been limited, with the gross domestic saving to  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) ratio at 24% in 2001. The banking sector is dominant (accounting for \n70.7% of GDP) relative to the nonbanking financial sector, is still in a nascent stage, with assets \nof less than 3% of total bank assets. \n \n3.  The banking sector is dominated by the state. For credit, state-owned commercial banks \n(SOCBs) provide 72% of total bank loans in the economy. Approximately 45% of SOCBs\u2019 credit \nis channeled to state-owned enterprises, and a high proportion of the loans are nonperforming. \nThe poor asset quality and inefficient operation have deteriorated the profitability and financial \npositions of SOCBs: Returns on assets averaged \u20130.2%, and the capital to assets ratio stood at \n6% as of December 2001. Under the auspices of the International Monetary Fund and World \nBank, the Government is implementing comprehensive reform programs for the banking and \nstate-owned enterprise sectors. Given the extent of problems in both sectors, substantial time \nand resources are required for their successful transformation. \n \n4.  The  nonbanking  sector  is  still  in  the  early  stage  of  development.  Currently,  the \nnonbanking sector comprises the insurance and leasing businesses. Insurance penetration, \nmeasured by annual insurance premiums written to GDP, is still low at 1% of GDP in 2001 \ncompared with 6.5% in OECD countries in 2000.4 However, following the enactment of the new \ninsurance law, gross domestic insurance premiums have grown at an average rate of 30% per \nannum, reaching an estimated D4.9 trillion ($318.5 million) in 2001. The current regulatory \nframework is not supportive of sound growth of the industry. Strengthening the Insurance \nManagement Division of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), to monitor and regulate the insurance \nindustry is a matter of high priority. Currently it has 12 staff, all with limited supervisory \nexperience. Off-site surveillance and on-site inspection are being conducted on an annual basis. \nThe frequency and quality of surveillance are constrained by the number of qualified staff in the \nInsurance Management Division as well as its statutory power. \n \n                                                                 \n1  A cluster program in the pipeline approved on 20 November 2002 for a total amount of $75 million. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 26 August 2002. \n3  Doi Moi meaning \u201cRenovation\u201d, represents a period since 1986 which initiated the process of transition to a market-\nbased economy. \n4  In 2000, the ratio stood at 1.37 in Philippines, 1.42 in Indonesia, 1.63 in People\u2019s Republic of China, 2.27 in \nThailand, and 3.88 in Malaysia. ", "2 \n5.  There are eight financial leasing companies operating in Viet Nam, of which three are \njoint ventures with foreign investors or wholly foreign owned, and five are subsidiaries of \nSOCBs. Leased assets during 2001 are estimated to have amounted to D2 trillion ($130 \nmillion). Inconsistencies and gaps in the legal framework remain that  need to be addressed. \nLeasing regulations that involve many government agencies will require substantial coordination \nand procedures for enforcement of leasing contracts at times of default need to be established.  \n \n6.  The money and capital markets are similarly at rudimentary stages of development. \nMoney market transactions have been insignificant so far. Treasury bills issued by MOF, in \n2001 amounted to D3.955 trillion ($257 million). In a bid to develop the money market, the State \nBank of Viet Nam (SBV) will undertake policy reforms under FSPL II such as (i) introduction of \nmarket-based monetary and foreign exchange policies, (ii) deregulation on the issuance of \ndiverse money market instruments, and (iii) establishing a regulatory framework for money \nmarket  brokers  and  other  intermediaries.  Likewise,  trading  for  equities  and  bonds  at  the \nSecurities Trading Center (STC) is still limited. After over 5 years of meticulous planning and \nenactment of an extensive legal and regulatory framework for listed securities, the STC opened \non 28 July 2000 in Ho Chi Minh City. Currently there are 19 companies and 18 bonds listed on \nthe STC with total market capitalization of D1.605 billion ($104,329). \n \n7.  There has been substantial progress in building infrastructure and safety nets for the \nfinancial system. The Deposit Insurance Corporation of Vietnam was established in June 2000, \nwith support from the first financial sector program loan. The fundamental infrastructure for \nbuilding a sound and efficient financial sector, including an accounting and auditing system, and \nbasic laws on bankruptcy, contract enforcement, collateral, and loan recovery, is gradually being \ndeveloped.  The  Accounting  and  Policy  Department  of  MOF  is  drafting  the  Vietnamese \nAccounting Law. Vietnamese accounting standards, which are being developed based on \ninternational accounting standards while taking into account Viet Nam's specific conditions, are \nexpected to be completed by the end of 2004. Also, the Ministry of Justice plans to draft and \nsubmit for enactment a comprehensive secured transactions law. Furthermore, to enhance \npublic confidence in and the integrity of the financial system in anticipation of its gradual \neconomic integration with the regional and global financial system, Viet Nam will launch a \nprogram to establish an anti-money laundering (AML) system.  \n \n8.  ADB's Second Financial Sector Program Loan. To complement the recent banking \nsector restructuring and other policy reforms under the International Monetary Fund and the \nWorld Bank programs, the Government recognizes that Viet Nam needs to develop a sound \nmarket-based  nonbank  financial  sector  to  support  broad-based  and  sustainable  economic \ngrowth.  \n \n9.  With this objective in mind, the Government and ADB formulated the FSPL II to be \nlaunched in December 2002. It aims at developing alternative financing channels for economic \ngrowth by supplementing financial intermediation of the banking sector. To achieve this goal, \nthe FSPL II focuses on: \n \n(i)  establishing  a  regulatory  framework  for  the  insurance  business  and \nstrengthening the supervisory and regulatory frameworks, while promoting the \ndevelopment of key industry professionals; \n(ii)  promoting the leasing industry by creating a coherent regulatory framework, \ndeveloping  ground  rules  for  contract  enforcement,  and  enhancing  public \nawareness; ", "    3 \n(iii)  enabling  interbank/money  market  development  through  phased  interest  rate \nderegulation,  increasing  money  market  instruments,  and  developing  market \nmicrostructure; \n(iv)  fostering  capital  markets'  financial  intermediation  by  establishing  incentives \ncompatible to the regulatory framework for increasing quality shares on the \nmarket, strengthening the market surveillance system, and building the basis for \ninstitutional investors; and  \n(v)  continuing  to  build  financial  infrastructure  such  as  accounting  and  auditing \nsystems, a secured transactions registration system, a deposit insurance system, \nand an AML regime. \n10.  While there is strong commitment from the Government to undertake all necessary \npolicy reforms under the FSPL II, it introduces many new concepts and frameworks unfamiliar to \nViet Nam. Given the extent of policy reforms and the level of technical requirements, both \ntechnical inputs as well as targeted training to equip the executing and implementing agencies \nwith knowledge and skills to undertake the needed reforms are deemed necessary. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The primary purpose of the TA is to assist the Government in undertaking policy \nconditions proposed under the FSPL II. Its scope therefore parallels the FSPL II, covering \nprincipally the nonbanking and money/capital markets sectors.5 While the FSPL II is extensive, \nrequiring a multitude of policy reforms, the scope of the TA is selective and  focuses on a \nnumber of policy conditions of the FSPL II that have been assessed to require technical inputs \nand capacity-building activities for successful implementation.  \n \n12.  For the development of money markets, the TA will help draft a negotiable instrument \nlaw and provide legal and regulatory frameworks for money market instruments. This will \ninclude a comprehensive explanatory note, including explanations on all the articles of the draft \nlaw and a glossary of key terms. The TA will also assist the SBV in developing an efficient \ninformation system for money market activities. \n \n13.  Assistance to the leasing industry will aim to establish an enabling regulatory framework \nfor leasing. The TA will help establish a regulatory framework that includes both financial and \noperating leasing. 6 Specifically, the TA will draft (i) an action plan for introducing operating \nleasing in Viet Nam; it will specify the issues and constraints to introducing operating leasing \nand policy actions to be taken; and (ii) a consolidated regulation (decree), in consultation with \nrelated ministries, on financial and operating leasing, including, but not limited to, simplified \nprocedures and methods to deal with leased assets in cases where a lessee violates the lease \ncontract. \n \n                                                                 \n5  The detailed discussion of the background and rationale of each component addressed in this section can be found \nin the Memorandum of Understanding on the FSPL II for the ADB Loan Appraisal Mission dated 2 July 2002, or the \nADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board for the Second Financial Sector Program \nLoan for the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Manila. \n6  Operating leasing involves the acquisition of property for only a small portion of its useful life. An operating lease is \ncommonly used to acquire equipment on a short-term basis; the lessor meets all operating and maintenance costs. ", "4 \n14.  The TA will help the Government establish an AML system to fight against criminal \nactivities in and out of the financial sector to bolster pubic confidence in the sector. The TA input \nwill  include  (i)  drafting  a  decree  on  AML  regulations,  and  (ii)  drawing  a  master  plan  for \nestablishing a financial intelligence unit (FIU) in Viet Nam. The AML activities and the operation \nof the FIU will require the involvement of multiple law enforcement authorities, and will involve \nextensive consultations among related agencies. \n \n15.  Assistance in the insurance sector will focus on (i) identifying areas where compulsory \ninsurance is required, (ii) drafting the terms and tariffs for compulsory insurance, (iii) setting up \nan accounting system for insurance companies, (iv) drafting measures to enhance corporate \ngovernance  and  the  competitiveness  of  insurance  companies,  (v)  drafting  procedures  for \ndealing with  problem insurance companies, (vi) drafting a plan for the development of an \ninsurance supervisory agency, and  (vii) developing a  risk-based capital regulations system \nsuitable for Viet Nam. Each component will include training of staff through either workshops or \nroundtable discussions. \n \n16.  The capital market component of the TA will comprise assistance on the following items \nas requested by the Government: (i) opening and operating a trading board for the Hanoi STC; \n(ii) market surveillance and inspection procedures for the Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City STCs, (iii) \nenforcement of corporate governance principles; (iv) establishment of an independent securities \ndepository center; (v) establishing the legal framework for public offerings, back-door listings, \nand mergers and acquisitions; and (vi) establishing a capital market resource center. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  The TA will fund consultants with expertise in nonbanking financial sectors and capital \nmarkets, who  will  conduct  in-depth  consultations  with  the  Government  and  private  sector \nstakeholders. Consultations will be part of the process to produce targeted outputs, and will be \nfollowed by a number of roundtable discussions and workshops to transfer the knowledge and \nskills needed by all stakeholders to implement the policy conditions under the FSPL II. ADB will \nmonitor the process closely to ensure the quality of outputs and training. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA, estimated to cost $1,255,000 equivalent, includes a foreign exchange cost of \n$883,200 and a local currency cost of $371,800 equivalent. A total of $1,000,000 equivalent\u2014\nthe total foreign exchange cost and $116,800 equivalent of local currency cost\u2014will be financed \non a grant basis by the ADB-funded TA Special Fund. The Government will contribute $255,000 \nequivalent in kind for office space, counterpart staff, and other miscellaneous services. Details \nof the cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  SBV will be the Executing Agency for the TA; and SBV, MOF, and the State Securities \nCommission will be the implementing agencies (IAs). In addition to office space, the IAs will \nprovide counterpart staff and other support services to the consultants. The program steering \ncommittee, which will be formed under the FSPL II, will oversee TA implementation. SBV will \nappoint a project director for the purposes of assisting in daily implementation of the TA. \n \n20.  The TA will require 24 person-months of international and 20 person-months of domestic \nconsultant inputs. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. The TA will ", "    5 \nhave separate contracts for each component. Individual consultants will be recruited to (i) \nstrengthen the legal framework and information system for money market, (ii) upgrade the \nregulatory framework for leasing, (iii) establish an AML system, and (iv) develop the supervisory \nand governance frameworks for insurance. The international consultants will be a negotiable \ninstruments law specialist, an information technology specialist for money market information \nsystem,  a  leasing  industry  specialist,  an  anti-money  laundering  specialist,  and  insurance \nspecialists. The domestic consultants will be a banking expert and an insurance expert.  \n \n21.  The capital market component will be contracted to an international consulting firm for 9 \nperson months each of international and domestic consulting services.  International capital \nmarket specialists will be required with expertise in (i) supervision and prudential regulation of \nsecurities  trading  centers,  (ii)  corporate  governance,  (iii)  establishment of an independent \nsecurities depository center, (iv) legal framework for public offerings, back-door listings and \nmergers and acquisitions, and (v) establishment of a capital market resource center. A domestic \ncapital market specialist will also be required under this component. The consulting contract will \nbe allocated with a budget of about $370,000. The quality-based selection method is proposed \nin selecting the consultants as the assignments entail drafting of key laws and regulations in the \nfinancial sector, inadequacies of which will result in high cost for the sector as well as the whole \neconomy. Shortlisted firms will submit simplified technical proposals.  All the consultants will be \nselected  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. \n \n22.  The consultants will prepare a detailed work plan before the start of services, which will \ninclude a timetable for deliverables defined under each component of the TA. The consultants \nengaged are required to submit interim reports within the deadline specified in the work plan \nagreed upon with ADB. The interim reports will be reviewed by the SBV, the IAs, and ADB. Draft \nfinal reports will be submitted within the deadline specified in the work plans after incorporation \nof feedback from SBV, the IAs, and ADB. Tripartite meetings will be held before finalization of \nthe draft final reports. The final report, incorporating comments of SBV, the IAs, and ADB during \nand after the tripartite meetings, should be submitted upon completion of service. The TA is \nscheduled to commence in January 2003 and to be completed by December 2003. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n23.  The President, acting under the  authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance on a grant basis to the Government of Viet Nam in an amount \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 for the Capacity Building  for Nonbank Financial \nInstitutions and the Capital Market, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national      Yes  Sector identified as a national    Yes   \npriority in country poverty analysis?  priority in country poverty  \n  partnership agreement? \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nThe financial sector's contribution to poverty reduction in Viet Nam on both the macro and \nindividual levels. \n \nFirst, the financial sector supports economic growth through mobilizing resources (savings \nand other means of investments domestically and internationally). In Viet Nam, in addition to \nexisting banks, other financial intermediaries such as insurance and leasing as well as \ncapital markets are still in the primary stage. Under the Second Financial Sector Program \nLoan  (FSPL  II),  the  development  of  these  subsectors  will  help  to  mobilize  domestic \nresources and long-term funding in particular. The Government estimates that, for 2001-\n2005, about $60 billion will be mobilized for development investment. This target can only \nbe achieved by a well-functioning and diversified financial sector.  \n \nSecond, the financial sector also functions as a channel for allocating resources to the real \nsector.  Currently,  many  segments  of  the  economy  including  the  private  sector  and \nespecially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have difficulties in accessing credit \nand other financial services. This is because of high costs, lack of regional outreach, and \nlimited understanding of alternative sources of funding. Under the FSPL II, these constraints \nwill be addressed. Moreover, the development of the real sectors, including the private \nsector, especially SMEs, benefits from higher accessibility and diversification of  financial \nproducts and services.
