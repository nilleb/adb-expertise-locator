THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed results-\nbased loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Air Quality Improvement in the Greater \nBeijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) Region\u2014Henan Cleaner Fuel Switch Investment Program.1 \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of the PRC agreed in 2015 to \nestablish a multiyear lending program (2015\u20132020) that aims to reinforce government actions to \nreduce air pollution in the greater BTH region.2 The proposed program is the fifth loan under the \nmultiyear lending program for air pollution reduction in the greater BTH region. It supports a switch \nto cleaner fuel, that is from coal to gas (natural gas and biogas) for residential, commercial, and \nindustrial use to improve air quality in Henan Province.3 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n3.  The greater BTH region is a major industrial and commercial zone, and generates about \none-third of the PRC\u2019s gross domestic product. The region\u2019s gross domestic product has grown \nby about 8% annually between 2009 and 2018, but the heavy reliance on coal as the primary \nenergy source for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes has resulted in serious and \nextensive air pollution. To address this, the PRC launched the first Comprehensive Action Plan \nfor Air Pollution Prevention and Control 2013\u20132017, which aimed to improve air quality. The plan\u2019s \nsuccessful  implementation  has  reduced  concentrations  of  particulate  matter  less  than  2.5 \nmicrometer in diameter (PM2.5) by 39.6%, from 105 micrograms per cubic meter (\u03bcg/m3) in 2013 \nto 64 \u03bcg/m3 in 2017.4 To further improve air quality, in June 2018 the central government issued \nthe Three-Year Action Plan to Win Blue Sky War (2018\u20132020) to reduce emissions of nitrogen \noxide (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO ) by over 15%, and emissions of PM  by over 18%, by 2020 \n2 2.5\n(from 2015 levels). 5 \n \n4.  Henan Province is located within the greater BTH region, and is the PRC\u2019s second-most \npopulous and most coal-dependent province. It has good access to the major national natural gas \ntransmission pipelines, but this has not been fully taken advantage of to reduce air pollution.6 In \n2018, coal provided about 72.0% of primary energy, compared with the national average of \n                                                \n1  The greater BTH region includes Beijing and Tianjin municipalities; Hebei, Henan, Liaoning, Shandong, and Shanxi \nprovinces; and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. \n2  ADB. 2015.

Beijing.  \n6  Two transnational natural gas pipelines (West\u2013East Gas Pipeline I and II) pass through 10 provinces, including \nHenan, and have transported natural gas from Central Asia to the east coast of the PRC since 2015.  \n ", "2 \n59.0%. Henan Province remains a major contributor to air pollution in the greater BTH region. \nCoal burning is the major source of air pollution in the province, and the provincial government\u2019s \nmedium-term and long-term energy development plan (2012\u20132030) has a strategic target of \nincreasing the natural gas supply, with dependence on coal as a primary energy source targeted \nto decline to 65% by 2023 and 58% by 2030. In 2014, it issued the Henan Blue Sky Action Plan \n(2014\u20132017) to reduce, by 2017, emissions of particulate matter less than 10 micrometer in \ndiameter (PM ) by 15% and PM  by 10% (from levels in 2012).7 These targets were achieved, \n10 2.5\nbut Henan Province nevertheless recorded air pollutant concentrations in 2018 for PM  of 63 \n2.5\n\u03bcg/m3; PM10 of 114 \u03bcg/m3: SO2 of 15 \u03bcg/m3; and NOx of 39 \u03bcg/m3; these all far exceed the national \ncategory I air quality standard, and the World Health Organization standard.8 In 2018, the \nprovincial government further launched its Three-Year Action Plan for Henan Province to Combat \nBlue  Sky  War  (2018\u20132020).9 It  includes  comprehensive  policy  actions  to  (i)  reduce  coal \nconsumption, promote energy efficiency, deploy renewable energy, and reduce emissions from \ntransport; (ii) reduce PM2.5 to 58 \u03bcg/m3 by 2020; and (iii) achieve the national air quality category \nII standard (35 \u03bcg/m3) by 2023. \n \n5.  Henan Province\u2019s policy framework (para. 4) seeks to reduce both high coal dependency \nand  air  pollution.  The  provincial  government\u2019s  actions  focus  primarily  on  reducing  coal \nconsumption through an annual limit, demolition of energy-inefficient coal-fired boilers, and \npromotion  of  natural  gas  and  other  cleaner  fuels.  As  a  result,  the  province\u2019s  natural  gas \nconsumption increased by 60.2% during 2014\u20132018. The primary driver was the increased supply \nof gas in urban areas, which accounted for 67.1% of total natural gas consumption in 2018.10 \nDespite the rapid expansion in natural gas consumption in major urban centers, most of the \npopulation in semi-urban and rural areas in the province remains unserved, because of (i) the \nlimited ability to pay for gas, and preference for traditional fuels among rural households; and (ii) \nthe limited private and public investment appetite due to high costs of reaching geographically \nscattered populations in townships and villages.11 Another challenge is ensuring energy security, \nwhich requires decreased dependence on gas imports while sustaining a clean, long-term fuel \nsupply. Biogas as an alternative domestic energy source has a large potential, because Henan \nProvince is the largest producer of grain in the country. Production of biogas using crop waste is \nlargely untapped, with biogas production below 1% of the province\u2019s resource potential. \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n6.  Cleaner  fuel  switch  investment  program.  Based  on  the  provincial  government\u2019s \nmedium- and long-term energy development plan,12 the Cleaner Fuel Switch Investment Program \n(2019\u20132030) was formulated to provide a clear expenditure and financing framework for access \nto gas in semi-urban and rural areas. This aims to establish a distributed gas supply network with \n                                                \n7  Government of Henan Province. 2014. Henan Blue Sky Action Plan.

Natural \ngas consumption in the cities has increased by 119% between 2014 and 2018. \n11 A project completion report for Air Quality Improvement Project in Henan Province  found that outcomes fell short of \ntargets with respect to physical connections (52%) and natural gas utilization (36%) because of a low investment \nappetite among gas suppliers caused by the high initial cost of extending the distribution network in the targeted \ncounties, resistance among the rural population to switching from traditional fuels (coal and firewood), and a lack of \ninterest among end-users because of high connection fees (Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2013. The \nProject Completion Report for Air Quality Improvement Project in Henan Province. Tokyo.). \n12  Government  of  Henan  Province.  2012.  Medium-  and  Long-Term  Energy  Development  Plan  (2012\u20132030). \nZhengzhou. \n ", "3 \na target of reaching 4.5 million customers in 80 counties in the province by 2030. These areas are \nless developed and geographically scattered, and the population is still largely dependent on coal \nfor primary energy use. The fuel switch from coal to gas for residential, commercial, and industrial \ncustomers in semi-urban and rural areas was initiated in 2018 on pilot basis, and 307,078 \ncustomers in 10 counties were connected to cleaner fuel. The program will expand the gas supply \nnetwork and biogas production in a phased manner until 2030; it will require an investment of \n\u20ac1,988.9 million, including \u20ac1,383.7 in debt financing and \u20ac605.2 million in equity contribution \nfrom the program\u2019s implementing agencies. \n \n7.  Proposed results-based lending program. To ensure the long-term investment needed \nto support the switch from coal to gas is sustainably funded, the program will adopt ADB\u2019s results-\nbased lending (RBL) modality during its initial stage. ADB\u2019s RBL program will support program \nfinancing during 2019\u20132023 (the overall investment program is for 2019\u20132030). To address \nidentified development challenges, the RBL program design incorporates lessons from past \ninvestments in natural gas supply networks in the province, including (i) reducing entry barriers \nfor targeted customers by providing free connections; (ii) employing awareness campaigns for \nnew customers to develop an awareness of safety issues and induce a switch away from \ntraditional fuels; (iii) including biogas as a cleaner fuel source; and (iv) building institutional \ncapacity to ensure sustainable investment and efficient operation, with private sector involvement \nto improve gas supply and customer service quality. The RBL modality is considered appropriate \nbecause it will (i) provide incentives to deliver on core results; (ii) enhance institutional and \norganizational capacity to leverage sustainable funding for subsequent long-term investment in \nthe overall program; and (iii) lower the transaction costs of managing numerous small-scale \nactivities and expenditures across the province using existing fiduciary and safeguard systems, \nwhich will be further reinforced with an agreed program action plan (PAP).13 \n \n8.  Sector deregulation and private sector involvement. The private sector has been \nactive in supplying gas in urban areas, but the natural gas industry in the PRC has been largely \ndominated by state-owned enterprises which own most of the pipeline networks, storage facilities, \nand liquefied natural gas terminals; the existing industrial structure is hindering the response to \nthe immediate need to reduce coal consumption to improve air quality. The government has \ninitiated several reforms since 2018 that deregulate the natural gas sector in order to encourage \nprivate sector participation in upstream and downstream natural gas supply.14 The RBL program \nis aligned with ongoing sector deregulation in natural gas supply; private sector involvement will \npromote efficient gas delivery operations and services in semi-urban and rural areas, which is a \ndifficult market segment for the private sector to tackle alone. A partnership with a private \ncompany was arranged to undertake the Cleaner Fuel Switch Investment Program. A special \npurpose vehicle\u2014the Henan Yu-Tian New Energy Co. Ltd. (YTNE)15\u2014was established as a joint \nventure project company between the Zhongyuan Yuzi Investment Holding Group (ZYIG), a \n                                                \n13 RBL is considered a suitable loan modality for programmatic activities across extensive areas and activities. Unlike \nthe sector loan modality, the RBL requirements are applied to the entire program (beyond the ADB-financed \ncomponents), and to counterpart and cofinancing components. RBLs can also be linked directly to capacity \ndevelopment. While program implementation ability was demonstrated through the initial connection of more than \n300,000 customers in 2018, there is room to improve the overall capacity of the program implementing agencies and \nstaff with clear milestones; hence, RBL frameworks with disbursement-linked mechanisms will provide incentives to \nimprove capacity to sustain operations and leverage financing to achieve the long-term program goals. The PAP is \naccessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n14 The deregulation policy includes (i) open access to natural gas infrastructure for the third party, (ii) linking domestic \nnatural gas gate price with international market price, and (iii) introducing the return on asset benchmark for \ntransmission (8%) and distribution (7%). \n15 YTNE was established in June 2018 to implement the Cleaner Fuel Switch Investment Program. \n \n ", "4 \nprovincial  government-owned  enterprise, 16 and  the  China  Tian  Lun  Gas  Holding  Limited \n(CTLG),17 a private gas supplier. \n  \n9.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB financing using the RBL program modality will add substantial \nvalue by setting up a framework for sustainable implementation of the overall investment program \nand (i) providing (a) comprehensive support for behavioral changes in energy use through \nawareness campaigns to use gas, with particular attention on gender; and (b) cost reductions \nthrough no-cost gas connections for rural customers to lower social disparities in gas use; (ii) \nfacilitating technology adoption for biogas production using the dry fermentation process, which \nis the first application in piped biogas supply in the PRC; and (iii) demonstrating a sustainable \nbusiness model with private sector involvement in gas supply in semi-urban and rural areas, \nthrough capacity enhancement of the program implementing agencies with respect to corporate \ngovernance, financial management, environmental and social safeguards, procurement and \nanticorruption, and gender development. The RBL program provides a holistic solution to reducing \ndevelopment barriers to gas access in semi-urban and rural areas of the province. The lessons \nand experience from the RBL program are expected to be disseminated to other provinces in the \ngreater BTH region that face similar challenges.18 The business model can also be replicated in \nother countries for a sustainable cleaner fuel switch to improve air quality. \n \n10.  The RBL program is fully aligned with the priorities of broadening the response to climate \nchange and strengthening environmental sustainability in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nthe PRC, 2016\u20132020.19 It will support key strategic pillars of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) tackling \nclimate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental \nsustainability  by  accelerating  low  greenhouse  gas  emissions  development  and  ensuring \nenvironmental sustainability through actions for expansion of natural gas use and development \nof bioenergy to build low carbon energy system in the PRC and thereby support its Nationally \nDetermined Contributions;20 (ii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity by providing \ninclusive gas service with greater engagement of the private sector; and (iii) accelerating progress \nin achieving gender equality through gender mainstreaming activities.21 The RBL program will \nalso  contribute  to  Sustainable  Development  Goal  7 (Ensure  access  to  affordable, reliable, \nsustainable, and modern energy for all) by providing affordable access to cleaner fuels in rural \nareas. \n \nC.  Program Scope \n \n11.  Based on the medium- and long-term energy development plan (2012\u20132030) of Henan \nProvince (footnote 12), the Cleaner Fuel Switch Investment Program (2019\u20132030) supports \nexpansion of the natural gas network and development of biogas in support of a switch to cleaner \nfuels, thereby reducing coal use and improving air quality. The program is being implemented in \n                                                \n16 ZYIG was established in 2011 with a mandate to finance urban and rural development for housing and associated \nbasic infrastructure in Henan Province. \n17 CTLG was established in 2002 for natural gas supply and sales. It was also listed in the Hong Kong stock exchange \nin 2011. It operates a natural gas business in 60 cities (across 17 provinces) in the PRC. \n18 ADB shared practices and approaches from past and ongoing projects for air pollution reduction in the greater BTH \nregion with other provinces in the PRC and other countries in 2018.

The RBL program\u2019s impact will be air quality improved, with a switch in fuel from coal to \ngas aligned with the Henan Province medium- and long-term energy development plan (2012\u2013\n2030) (footnote 12). The outcome will be increased use of cleaner fuels by residential, commercial, \nand industrial customers in Henan Province (disbursement-linked indicators [DLIs] 1 and 2).22 \nInstitutional capacity enhancement under the RBL program will also lay the foundation to enable \nCNY 915 million of commercial financing (DLI 3), which will sustain investments under the overall \nprogram till 2030. The RBL program will have four outputs. \n \n13.  Output 1: Gas network system expanded. The RBL will develop a distributed gas \nsystem including a 26,880 kilometer (km) distribution network (DLI 4), and 12 gas stations (DLI \n5), thereby replacing the old coal-burning facilities. To address affordability concerns for rural \n                                                \n22 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "6 \nconsumers, the RBL program will offer (i) end pipe connections at no cost; and (ii) an installment \npayment scheme to help purchase gas appliances, such as cooking stoves and heaters. \n \n14.  Output 2: Alternative clean fuel developed. The RBL program will develop a pilot biogas \nplant with an annual production capacity of 17 million Nm3 using the dry anaerobic fermentation \nprocess with agricultural waste to supplement natural gas in the future (DLI 6). The pilot plant will \nbe the first utility-scale dry fermentation technology application for piped gas supply in the PRC, \nproducing high-quality biomethane, which meets the PRC natural gas regulation standards. \n \n15.  Output 3: Cleaner fuel use awareness enhanced. The RBL program will help change \nthe use of traditional energy by consumers, and enhance awareness regarding the use of cleaner \nfuels, and gas safety. It targets greater participation by female customers (at least 50% of \nparticipants) in the cleaner fuel awareness campaign that includes the benefit of gas for cooking \nand heating, the use of gas appliances, and safety of gas use. Continuous implementation of the \nawareness campaign will be essential to meet increased gas connection and consumption targets \nunder the RBL program; at least 500 awareness campaigns will be convened throughout the \nprogram implementation period (DLI 7). \n \n16.  Output 4: Institutional and organizational capacity enhanced. The RBL program will \nsupport institutional and organizational capacity enhancement of ZYIG and YTNE to sustain \noverall program implementation, including after completion of the RBL program (DLI 8). This \nincludes (i) developing an integrated enterprise resource planning and management system; (ii) \nstrengthening corporate governance and management systems in financial and risk control, and \nenvironment  and  social  safeguard  management;  (iii)  expanding  fund-raising  capacity  and \nfinancing avenues for commercial borrowing; and (iv) increasing staff resources to ensure sound \nprogram implementation, with a gender balance target of increasing the proportion of female staff \nmembers, from 15% in 2018 to 30% by 2022. \n \n17.  Eight DLIs were selected to effectively promote the use of cleaner fuels through the \ndevelopment of the gas infrastructure; technology development through the use of advanced \nbiogas fermentation technology; private sector involvement for efficient service delivery and \nsustainable funding; and behavioral changes among end-users, with particular attention on \ngender. The program is projected to reach a total of 1.2 million customers, with gas consumption \nof 316.63 million m3 per year. The RBL program is focused on core results; therefore, 55% of the \ntotal ADB loan amount is allocated to DLIs 1, 2, and 3.

Expenditure Framework and Financing Plan \n \n19.  Program expenditures. The RBL program expenditures are estimated to total \u20ac556.6 \nmillion from 2019 to 2023 (Table 3). \n \nTable 3: Summary of Program Expenditure Framework, 2019\u20132023 \n  Amount  Share of Total \nItem  (\u20ac million)  (%) \nGas network system expanded  409.1  73.5 \nAlternative biogas fuel developed  49.2  8.8 \nCleaner fuel use awareness enhanced among female customers  0.5  0.1 \nInstitutional and organizational capacity enhanced  7.4  1.3 \nAdministration cost  5.1  0.9 \nInterest and commitment charge  15.4  2.8 \nContingencies  69.9  12.6 \nTotal  556.6  100.0 \nSources: Zhongyuan Yuzi Investment Holding Group and China Tian Lun Gas Holding Limited estimates. \n \n20.  Program financing. The Government of the PRC has requested a regular loan of \u20ac269.0 \nmillion from ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (48.3%)  to  help  finance  the  program.  China \nDevelopment Bank will loan \u20ac185.2 million (33.3%). The balance of \u20ac102.4 million will be financed \nby the program implementing agencies. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line \nmethod, average maturity is 15.25 years, and maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per \nyear.

Disbursement arrangements. Disbursements will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB. Loan disbursements will be made to a dedicated \n ", "8 \naccount  to  be  designated  by  the  Government  of  Henan  Province  based  on  the  verified \nachievement of DLIs. Financing of prior results achieved not more than 12 months before loan \nsigning is allowed to support achieving the results as scheduled, given that such activities comply \nwith the PAP and the results are verified in accordance with verification protocols. The total \namount of such financing will not exceed 20% of total amount. Except for DLIs 7 and 8, partial \ndisbursement is allowed in proportion to the DLI target achievements, provided that these are \nverified and accepted by ADB. Disbursements may be made early or late subject to the DLI \nachievements. This means that, regardless of the DLI target years, disbursements can be made \nonly when the set targets are met during the RBL program. Verification mechanism and protocols \nhave been established depending on the nature of the DLIs (Appendix 3). \n \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n22.  Extensive assessments have identified capacity gaps in implementing the RBL program. \nAn initial PAP was prepared and agreed with ZYIG and YTNE to define specific activities for \nimproving the program implementation capacity, as targeted in DLIs for the program\u2019s outputs for \ninstitutional  capacity  enhancement.  The  PAP  covers  corporate  governance,  financial \nmanagement, environment and social safeguards, procurement and anticorruption, and gender \ndevelopment. The PAP is based on the capacity gap assessments in implementing the initial \nstage of the program to achieve the overall outreach target. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The executing agency is the Government of Henan Province, with overall responsibility for \nexecuting the program. The implementing agencies are ZYIG and YTNE, which are responsible \nfor implementing and monitoring the program\u2019s activities. The program coordination committee \nwill be established among ZYIG, YTNE, and provincial government agencies to oversee the \nprogram implementation and provide strategic guidance and direction. The ADB financing would \nbe onlent from the Government of the PRC to the Government of Henan Province for further \nrelending to ZYIG, with further onlending of the proceeds to YTNE on the same terms and \nconditions. YTNE will assume the ADB loan\u2019s foreign exchange risk.23 Concluding onlending \narrangements across the Henan Provincial Government (HPG), ZYIG, and YTNE will be a \ncondition of the first ADB loan withdrawal. \n \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n24.  The RBL program\u2019s technical assessment indicates that the design of gas networks and \ngas stations fully complied with the national construction standards, and the associated cost \nestimate reflects the actual construction cost from natural gas supply projects implemented by \nCTLG. The biogas dry fermentation technology is proven in Europe but this will be the first \napplication to piped gas supply in the PRC. The biogas design fully meets international standards \nand the estimated capital cost is the range of international costs. The first-of-its-kind technology \nrisk in the PRC can be controlled by engaging an experienced international technology supplier. \nThe overall gas safety standard for construction and operation is in accordance with natural gas \nsafety regulations and guidelines in the PRC, which are as stringent as in the United States and \n                                                \n23 By 2020, YTNE will establish a foreign currency fluctuation reserve fund, with terms acceptable to ADB, to mitigate \nthe foreign currency exchange risk of the ADB loan. \n \n ", "9 \nEurope.24 The gas facilities are designed to detect possible gas leakage at the end-users\u2019 meters, \ndistribution networks, and gas stations. YTNE is also aligned with the operational safety code of \nCTLG, which is compliant with international best practice. \n \n25.  The RBL program\u2019s scope is considered appropriate to help sustainably implement the \noverall program. The overall cleaner fuel switch program adopts a phased approach with learning-\nby-doing practices to construct and expand the gas supply networks. The RBL program aims to \nsupport the initial stage of the overall program to build practical capacity and knowledge to achieve \nthe overarching program targets until 2030. Based on successful implementation of the RBL \nprogram, the overall program is expected to be implemented with additional commercial financing \nand  private  sector  involvement,  which  is  consistent  with  the  PRC\u2019s  ongoing  natural  gas \nderegulation policy (para. 8). The RBL program\u2019s financial and economic assessments found the \nprogram  to  be  financially  viable  and  economically  sustainable.25 The  institutional  financial \nperformance of YTNE and ZYIG are projected to remain sound under the overall program. \n \n26.  The RBL program is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The gender analysis \nindicates women in the project area are largely responsible for household energy use for heating, \ncooking, and heating water for bathing children and elderly. These activities can be time intensive, \nparticularly for the poorest households that still use coal or firewood. While they are supportive of \nthe introduction of cleaner, faster, and more convenient fuels, women in the project sites want to \nknow more about how to safely use non-traditional fuel. Changing traditional fuel use behavior \namong the targeted population in townships and villages is a challenge to achieving the intended \nresults. Cleaner fuel awareness campaigns under the RBL program will support a change to gas \nuse among end-users and will involve the participation of women (at least 50% of participants) in \nthe campaigns, which will focus on the benefits of gas for cooking and heating, and safe usage \nof gas and gas appliances.26 The campaign will be undertaken on an ongoing basis, with at least \n500 events throughout the implementation period to ensure that a critical mass of users is reached \nand that connection and consumption targets under the RBL program are met. In addition, the \nshare of female staff in YTNE will be doubled, from 15% in 2019 to 30% in 2022. \n \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n27.  Monitoring  and  evaluation  systems.  The  existing  YTNE  management  information \nsystem  will  accommodate  the  data  needed  to  monitor  the  overall  program  and  track  DLI \nachievements. However, the present management information system (MIS) comprises separate \nindependent systems, with no integrated function to comprehensively cover customer service \nmanagement, financial control, procurement and construction, operation and maintenance, and \nsafety aspects. The RBL program will upgrade the existing MIS into an integrated enterprise \nresource planning system, which is an output-level DLI to be achieved by 2020. To complement \nmonitoring and evaluation systems, an independent verification agent (IVA) will be engaged to \nverify information related to DLIs and to monitor PAP implementation for compliance. The IVA is \nto be selected in accordance with qualification criteria as detailed in the program implementation \ndocument;27 the IVA selection is subject to ADB\u2019s prior approval. To assure the credibility of the \n                                                \n24 Safety regulation requirements and benchmarks in the PRC are equivalent to those in Europe and the United States. \nFor instance, the benchmark for acceptable gas leakage per 1,000 km pipeline is 0.4 times in both the PRC and the \nUnited States. Actual leakage per 1,000 km is 0.19 times in the PRC while 0.17 times in Europe in 2018. \n25 The program\u2019s financial rate of return is 7.76% and economic rate of return is 10.94%. Each is above the benchmark \nthreshold under sensitivity tests. \n26 In addition to safe usage, the campaign will aim to positively portray the roles of men and women in household energy \ntasks to address stereotyping and promote equal sharing of household responsibilities. \n27 Program Implementation Document (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nverification results in a transparent manner, the PAP mandates that ZYIG and YTNE adopt an \ninformation disclosure policy to share information on progress and achievement of DLIs with \ntargeted customers and the public. \n \n28.  Fiduciary systems. The program will use ZYIG and YTNE\u2019s fiduciary systems in financial \nmanagement,  procurement,  and  anticorruption.  Their  financial  management  assessment \nindicates that financial management systems are in place, but that there is room to improve \nZYIG\u2019s internal control and risk management systems, which could affect YTNE as the majority \nshareholder. ZYIG corporate governance strengthening will help ensure that overall program \nmanagement is sustainable and transparent, and build market confidence, which is important in \nattracting more commercial financing following completion of the RBL program. ZYIG\u2019s corporate \ngovernance and YTNE\u2019s institutional capacity will be strengthened by 2020, as included in the \noutput-level DLI and PAP.28 \n \n29.  Gaps identified by the procurement assessment include (i) a shortage of experienced \nprocurement staff, (ii) the absence of standard bid documents in compliance with both national \nand ADB procurement policies, and (iii) loose definitions of conflict of interest and related party \ntransaction in national procurement systems. These gaps will be addressed by the PAP, while \nhigh-value contracts will be excluded from the RBL program.29 ADB Guidelines to Prevent or \nMitigate  Fraud,  Corruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  Results-Based  Lending  for \nPrograms were explained to and agreed with the executing and implementing agencies.30 \n \n30.  Safeguard systems. The RBL program has been classified as Category B for the \nenvironment and involuntary resettlement, and Category C for indigenous people, in accordance \nwith the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The RBL program will not involve activities \nclassified as Category A for environment, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous people. YTNE \nwill adopt CTLG\u2019s Environment, Health and Safety Policy and has adequate capacity to manage \nthe social and environmental risks associated with RBL program activities. Based on the program \nsafeguard systems assessment (PSSA),31 the overall requirements of environment and social \nsafeguard  assessments,  monitoring,  and  management  were  defined  in  YTNE\u2019s  corporate \ntechnical guidelines for environment and social safeguards. \n \n31.  Environment safeguards. Outputs 1 and 2 could have negative environmental impacts \nduring  construction,  including  soil  erosion,  fugitive  dust,  solid  waste,  and  community  and \noccupational health and safety risks. During operation, potential negative environmental impacts \ninclude gas odor, wastewater, solid waste, noise, and community and occupational health and \nsafety risks. Overall, the PSSA concludes that negative impacts during construction and operation \ncan  be  effectively  minimized  and  mitigated.  Weaknesses  identified  by  the  environmental \nsafeguard risk assessment were (i) the lack of a grievance redress mechanism, (ii) the absence \nof  meaningful  public  consultations  for  projects  classified  as  category  B,  (iii)  the  lack  of \nenvironmental audit and assessment of associated and existing facilities, (iv) the lack of analysis \nof  alternatives,  and  (v)  inadequate  institutional  arrangements  to  monitor  environmental \nmanagement plan implementation. These gaps are addressed in the environment safeguard \n                                                \n28 The corporate governance strengthening will include (i) issuing financial and risk management guidelines; (ii) \nengaging an external board of director with oversight regarding internal control and risk assessment; and (iii) \nstrengthening the corporate governance structure through establishment of the audit and risk management \ncommittee, and investment decision committee under the board. \n29 The amounts are $50 million for works, turnkey and supply, and installation contracts; $30 million for goods; $20 \nmillion for information technology systems and non-consulting services; and $15 million for consulting services. \n30 ADB. 2013. Piloting Results-Based Lending for Programs. Manila. \n31 Program Safeguard Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "11 \ntechnical guidelines and PAP. A climate risk assessment has been conducted. Potential climate \nrisks to the program are assessed as medium, including an increase in seasonal and annual \ntemperature, precipitation, and the probability of drought severity and duration. These potential \nrisks will be addressed in the technical design. \n \n32.  Social safeguards. PSSA has been conducted to evaluate the PRC\u2019s resettlement \nsafeguards.  Output  1  will  involve  (i)  temporary  land  acquisition  impacts  associated  with \ndistribution pipeline installation and (ii) land acquisition for gas stations. Considering the size of \nregulatory and storage facilities in semi-urban and rural areas, the involuntary resettlement and \nland acquisition impacts are deemed not significant.32 For output 2, land acquisition will be \nrequired for construction of the pilot biogas plant, but the biogas plant site will be selected to \nensure it is classified as Category B for resettlement. Outputs 3 and 4 will not trigger involuntary \nresettlement impacts. Gaps identified by the assessment include (i) lack of screening and \ncategorization; (ii) no requirement for resettlement preparation, due diligence for past land \nacquisition, and a social compliance audit for existing facilities; (iii) lack of identification of poor \nand vulnerable groups during the involuntary resettlement screening process; (iv) inadequate \ndocumentation of consultation and information disclosure activities, and grievances received; (v) \ninadequate social risk analysis; and (vi) inadequate monitoring and evaluation. These gaps will \nbe addressed by the social safeguard technical guidelines and PAP, including a screening \nprocess to ensure that the RBL program will not involve subprojects classified as resettlement \ncategory A. The program is classified as category C for indigenous peoples as it is not expected \nto have any adverse impacts on ethnic minorities. \n \nC.  Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n \n33.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5. The overall RBL program \nrisk was assessed to be moderate. The benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nTable 5: Summary of Integrated Risk Assessment and Mitigating Measures \n  Ratings Without   \n  the Mitigating   \nRisks  Measures  Key Mitigating Measures \nResults-related risks \nSlower adoption of gas and/or use of  Substantial  The awareness campaign regarding gas use and \ntraditional fuels (e.g., coal, wood, and  safety will stimulate demand among the \nagricultural waste) following physical  customers.
