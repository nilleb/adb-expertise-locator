INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen Pakistan\u2019s food \nsecurity and resilience in agriculture. The TA is a response to the impacts of the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic and an unprecedented locust infestation. The TA will support the \nMinistry  of  National  Food  Security  and  Research  (MNFSR)  and  four  provincial  agriculture \ndepartments1 in (i) adopting technologies and advanced practices to manage the impacts of \nCOVID-19, locust swarms, and climate change impacts on agriculture productivity and the value \nchain; (ii) disseminating these technologies and practices to beneficiaries, including government \nand rural communities; and (iii) assessing agriculture and food security institutions and sector \nperformance to recommend measures for building long-term resilience and sustainable food \nsecurity systems.  \n \n2.  The TA is not included in the current country operations business plan.2 The TA is aligned \nwith Pakistan\u2019s country partnership strategies for 2015\u20132019 and 2020\u20132024.3 The TA meets \nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 2, 5, and 13,4 and Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nStrategy 2030 operational priorities (OPs) 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.5 \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.     Food insecurity and rural poverty. Pakistan is facing high levels of food insecurity. More \nthan 20% of its population is undernourished, 24% is living below the national poverty line, and \nabout 39% is categorized as multidimensional poor.6 Agriculture contributes to more than 19% of \ngross domestic product, employs 39% of the labor force, and directly and indirectly delivers nearly \n80% of the total value of exports.7 Yet, the average growth rate of agriculture from 2010\u20132011 to \n2019\u20132020 decreased compared with the 2000s. Agriculture is not performing to its potential.8 \nThe current food security portfolio and future direction need to be rigorously analyzed to see if \nthey support the long-term strategic priority of improving resilience in food security and agriculture.  \n \n4.  Compounded challenges of pandemic and unprecedented pest attack. COVID-19 \nhas spread rapidly, with 338,000 cases and 6,867 deaths as of 4 November 2020.9 The country \nis vulnerable to food insecurity, with 37% of the population (212 million) vulnerable to hunger. \nConfinement measures imposed by the Government of Pakistan in response to COVID-19 have \ndisrupted the food supply chain. Overlying these impacts is the largest locust infestation in 25 \n \n1  Balochistan Agriculture and Cooperatives Department; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Agriculture Department; Punjab \nAgriculture Department; and Sindh Agriculture, Supply, and Prices Department. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 November 2020. The TA was \nprepared on request of the MNFSR after the emergency worsened in February 2020. \n3  ADB.  2015.  Country  Partnership  Strategy:  Pakistan,  2015\u20132019.  Manila;  and  ADB.

The average agriculture growth rate \nremained at 2.25% from 2010\u20132011 to 2019\u20132020 compared with 2.46% from 2000\u20132001 to 2009\u20132010.  \n9  COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. \n ", "2 \nyears. Locust swarms migrating from neighboring Iran have devastated large areas of agricultural \nland, ravaging cotton, wheat, maize, and other crops.10 A preliminary high-level estimate for the \nworst case scenario predicts that about 34,000 households (238,000 people) in Balochistan, \nPunjab, and Sindh will be impacted by food insecurity. In response, Pakistan declared an \nemerg\u2010ency in February 2020 and commenced a national surveillance and control operation.  \n \n5.  Inefficient food system and price inflation. COVID-19 impacts and the locust outbreak \nslowed the economy. Growth for 2019\u20132020 was projected at 3.2% but subsequently reassessed \nat \u20130.4%.11 Crop damage prompted Pakistan to miss its production target for wheat by about 2 \nmillion tons, leading the country to import wheat for the first time since 2014. Low yields resulted \nin wheat and other food grain price increases, pushing general inflation in September 2020 to  \n9.0%  nationwide  and  11.1%  in  rural  areas.12 Loss  of  incomes  and  remittances  reduced \npurchasing power and induced food security risks.13 More than 35% of the country\u2019s rural \npopulation lives below the national poverty line. Households reliant on farming, and particularly \nwomen, are highly vulnerable to economic shocks due to disruptions in access to income, \neducation, and health care, and gender pay gaps. \n \n6.  Weak institutional capacity and coordination challenges. Agriculture is a provincial \nsubject, while food security and export policy and regulations lie within the federal domain of the \nMNFSR.14 Any initiative to strengthen food security and agriculture requires a coordinated and \ninformed effort between provincial and federal governments. Commodities and food information \nfrom existing systems (e.g., crop reporting services, provincial bureaus of statistics) are neither \ncomprehensive nor up to the standard required to support timely policy decision-making. Limited \ninstitutional capacity to process and analyze data poses further constraints, contributing to \ncountry-wide challenges in procuring, distributing, and pricing commodities (e.g., wheat). \n  \n7.  Outdated systems and technologies. Pakistan relies on outdated pest management, \nincluding obsolete knowledge and practices to combat locusts and other pests. These require \nupgrading to meet international standards for pest, especially locust, management. Bio-friendly \noptions  need  to  be  adopted  to  increase  safety  and  sustain  ecosystems.  Information  and \ncommunication  technology  (ICT)  and  remote-sensing  technologies  are  not  used  for  data \ncollection and associated food-monitoring systems. Manual data gathering delays decision-\nmaking on food pricing, commodity movement, among others, and negatively impacts food \nsecurity. \n  \n8.  Risk of climate change impacts. Pakistan is fifth on the list of countries that have \nremained most affected by climate change since the 2000s.15 It is one of the most vulnerable to \nclimate change, with recurrent catastrophes of extreme weather events, including floods, droughts, \nand heat waves. The country\u2019s food security and agriculture are critically exposed to the adverse \nimpacts of climate change. The adoption of climate-adaptive crop protection and production \npractices will improve resilience in agriculture.  \n \n10 The Department of Plant Protection (DPP), MNFSR surveyed 932,580 hectares in 2019 and treated 300,595 \nhectares in three provinces. \n11 Government of Pakistan, PBS. 2020.

About 79% of rural women are engaged in agriculture.16 They \nperform fundamental roles in livestock, crop harvest, and post-harvest support. Their contributions \nare largely overlooked in agriculture planning and investments.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: national food security sustained; resilience \nin agriculture and national food security increased; and national targets for agricultural growth \nachieved.17 The TA will have the following outcome: institutional capacity to manage a sustainable \nfood security system strengthened.18  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Technology-based data collection practices demonstrated. The project will \nsupport the MNFSR and the four provincial agriculture departments in designing, planning, and \nimplementing agriculture data collection using the latest technology. The project will provide more \nreliable and timely data on agriculture production, commodity prices, and the supply chain. The \nproject will (i) conduct surveys across four provinces to collect sample data on COVID-19 and the \nimpact of locust infestation on farming households and commodity price fluctuations,19 (ii) design \nand demonstrate ICT-based crop reporting practices for village data collection, and (iii) prepare a \nmodel for remote-sensing crop assessment and perform enumerated data validation. The project \nwill help improve historical data for effective policy making.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Advanced locust and other pest management practices disseminated. The \nproject will support the MNFSR through the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) and provincial \nagriculture  departments  in (i)  demonstrating  at  least  three  of  the  latest technologies (e.g., \nbiopesticides,  ICT-supported  drones)  applying  international  best  practices  in  safe  and \nenvironment-friendly management of locusts and other pests;20 and (ii) training at least 200 \nofficials  from  DPP  and  four  provincial  agriculture  departments  to  apply  integrated  pest \nmanagement practices, and training master trainers.21  \n \n13.  Output 3: Climate-adaptive and disaster-resilient agriculture practices increased in \nareas vulnerable to climate change and natural  hazards. The project will support rural \ncommunities increase their capacity to combat the impacts of climate change and natural hazards. \nThe project will (i) provide at least 2,000 farmers and staff members of local nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs),  10%  of  whom  are  women,  with  best  practices  in  sustainable  crop \nprotection; and (ii) demonstrate at least three technologies for climate-adaptive seed development \nor  crop  production.  Activity  (i)  will  conduct  master  training  on  adopting  ecosystem-friendly \npractices. It will upgrade women\u2019s skills in climate-adaptive and disaster-resilient crop seed \n \n16 D.

Output 4: Diagnostic assessment of food security and agriculture completed. The \nproject will support the MNFSR in conducting a diagnostic assessment of food security and \nagriculture. The project will contribute to timely and evidence-based policy decisions on key \npriorities  such  as  essential  commodity  production  and  forecasting,  real-time  monitoring  of \navailability and pricing of commodities, and financial inclusion opportunities for small farmers. The \nproject will (i) consult diverse groups of stakeholders, including the government (federal and \nprovincial), farmers, NGOs, the private sector, and international development partners; and (ii) \nprepare a diagnostic assessment report.22  \n \n15.  Innovation and ADB\u2019s value addition. The TA will promote innovative solutions to \neffectively respond to COVID-19 and locust outbreaks and to the challenges of building long-term \nsustainable  food  security.  The  TA  will  bring  best  international  practices  using  advanced \ntechnologies and knowledge into the food security system and agriculture through demonstration, \ncollaborating with reputable international knowledge institutes (footnote 20). The TA will offer \nintegrated solutions to resolve a range of issues with a \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach that applies cross-\ncutting knowledge and innovations.  \n \nC.
