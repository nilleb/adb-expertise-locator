INTRODUCTION \n1.  Food and nutrition security is a key element of the inclusive and sustainable growth \nagenda.  The  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nreaffirmed ADB\u2019s commitment to invest $2 billion annually in food security and agriculture in \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) of Asia and the Pacific.1 ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for \nAgriculture and Natural Resources: Promoting Sustainable Food Security in Asia and the Pacific \nin 2015\u20132020 provides guidance for ADB operations in the agriculture and natural resources \n(ANR) sector.2 This technical assistance (TA) will help accelerate ADB\u2019s efforts to implement the \nplan  through  pilot  innovations,  new  partnerships  building,  and  knowledge  solutions \ndevelopment.3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n2.  Although Asia and the Pacific has achieved the Millennium Development Goal of halving \nthe hunger rate, supported by impressive economic growth, approximately 490 million or two-\nthirds of the global hunger population remain in the region and high levels of malnutrition \npersist.4 In addition, as DMCs continue to evolve from low- to middle-income countries, they \nface a wide range of challenges to produce and supply more nutritious and safe food to a \ngrowing  middle  class  and  urban  population  in  the  face  of  shrinking  natural  resources,  a \ndegrading environment, global climate change and disaster risks, a changing labor profile and \ndemographics, and price and market volatilities. To assist DMCs strategically in addressing \nsuch highly diversified and dynamic challenges and working toward Sustainable Development \nGoal 2, innovations, partnerships, and new business approaches for knowledge solutions need \nto be brought into DMCs\u2019 ANR development and management.5  \n \n3.  Introducing innovative and best practices to address food and nutrition security issues is \nof common interest to many DMCs, who share the sector development targets to support \nclimate  resilience  building  in  the  ANR  sector;  and  agribusiness  development  and  market \norientation of the rural economy, which are reflected in country partnership strategies. The \nproposed TA will assist DMCs to introduce essential innovations, promising technologies, and \nnew business and partnership approaches in the ANR sector, particularly in three challenging \nareas, where ADB support to DMCs will be critical.  \n \n4.  First,  ADB  support  to  DMCs  should  be  expanded  in  climate-smart  agriculture  as \n(i) farming in DMCs is likely to face the highest reductions in agricultural potential as a result of \nclimate change,6 and (ii) the poor population in the region is particularly vulnerable to food \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

The Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources: Promoting Sustainable Food Security in \nAsia and the Pacific in 2015\u20132020. Manila. Adopted in June 2015, the operational plan emphasizes four priority \nareas for operations: (i) productivity enhancement; (ii) market connectivity and value chain linkage; (iii) food safety, \nquality, and nutrition; and (iv) climate resilience and sustainable management of natural resources.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 November 2015.   \n4  About 195 million of the hungry population resides in India; 134 million in the People\u2019s Republic of China; 19 million \nin Indonesia; and 14 million in the Philippines.

Rome: FAO. \n5  Sustainable Development Goal 2 is to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote \nsustainable agriculture. \n6  For instance, the expected negative effects in 2050 are especially profound in South Asia, where production \nreductions of 11%\u201318% for rice and 40%\u201345% for wheat are expected. ADB and International Food Policy \nResearch Institute. 2009. Building Climate Resilience in the Agriculture Sector of Asia and the Pacific. Manila.  \n ", "2   \nproduction  and  price  shocks  resulting  from  climate  change  and  extreme  weather  events.7 \nClimate  change  is  likely  to  impact  significantly  on  cropping,  agroforestry,  grazing,  and \naquaculture. Climate change adaptation and mitigation, and disaster risk management, are \ncritical to the food and nutrition security agenda in the region. ADB\u2019s engagement in DMCs for \nresilience building remains limited in light of the expected scale of adverse climate impacts.8  \n \n5.  The second area of focus is promoting inclusive and sustainable agribusiness value \nchain  development.  Asia\u2019s  food  systems  are  undergoing  a  significant  transformation  from \ninnovations at the farm level to the supermarket revolution, applications of information and \ncommunication technology innovations (e-commerce, mobile phone-based transactions, and \ninternet banking), and agricultural insurance tools. The grocery market in Asia has grown to \nmore than $1.9 trillion in 2015, and is expected to grow further at a fast rate of 8% per annum \nduring 2015\u20132020.9 In response to such market growth prospect, private sector enterprises \nhave begun constructing new supply value chains to source agricultural produce by investing in \nthe technical and institutional capacity improvement of agricultural value chains, many of which \nhave resulted in the increased productivity and incomes of many farming households.10 Such \nprivate sector initiatives also encourage the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices among \nsmallholder farmers, while increasing their supply capacity of high quality agricultural products. \nPublic investments have opportunities to scale up their development impacts to the national and \nregional levels by collaborating with private investments and helping them expand their market-\nbased solutions. Such collaborations will promote vertical integration of the food value chain and \ngenerate further opportunities, such as making sustainable agricultural practices the industry \nstandards, expanding green commodity markets, and effectively introducing food quality and \nsafety  controls.  Business  models  for  collaborating  with  private  sector  activities,  structuring \ncatalytic public investments with a clear exit strategy, and scaling up promising private sector \ninitiatives  need  to  be  strategically  incorporated  in  ADB\u2019s  operations  and  DMCs\u2019  sector \ndevelopments  plans.  ADB\u2019s  sovereign  and  nonsovereign  investments  in  ANR  have  been \nincreasing in recent years in this area. \n  \n6.  The  third  area  is  to  utilize  knowledge  partnerships  more  effectively  in  generating \nknowledge-based  interventions  and  addressing  the  highly  diversified  needs  of  DMCs.  The \ndevelopment  of  new  partnership  models  for  working  effectively  with  centers  of  excellence \n(COEs), private sector institutions, and platforms for innovation generation and implementation \nis critical to respond to the emerging challenges of DMCs and scale up the impacts of ADB\u2019s \nfood and nutrition security engagement. Effective knowledge partnership development with key \nCOEs, multilateral development banks, and the private sector is important for swiftly mobilizing \n                                                \n7  Climate-smart agriculture is defined as \u201cagriculture that sustainably increases productivity and resilience; reduces \ngreenhouse gases, and enhances achievement of national food security and development goals.\u201d FAO. 2010. \n\u201cClimate Smart\u201d Agriculture: Policies, Practices and Financing for Food Security, Adaptation and Mitigation. Rome. \n(page ii). Examples include alternate wetting and drying of rice crops that enable crop yield increase while reducing \nthe use of water, seeds, and fertilizer; agroforestry to restore biodiverse forests, which increase income-generating \nwood and tree products; and soil erosion protection measures that result in increase in yields and income. \n8   ADB is committed to increase its investment in climate-smart agriculture as part of its $6 billion annual commitment \nto support DMCs for climate change adaptation and mitigation by 2020. \n9  IGD Retail Analysis projections. http://www.igd.com/ \n10 For instance, Olam, Nestle, and Unilever have pledged the sourcing of sustainably cultivated raw materials and \nhave been supporting highly productive agricultural value chains development engaging 4.0 million (Olam), 5.0 \nmillion (Nestle), and 0.5 million (Unilever) smallholder farmers, together with civil society organizations, famers\u2019 \norganizations, and government agencies in DMCs. Beyond multinational companies, local food companies such as \nPRAN in Bangladesh, Engro in Pakistan, Akay in India and Cambodia, and Mountain Hazelnuts in Bhutan, are \nalso developing contract farming models to support sustainable agriculture of smallholder farmers.  \n ", "3 \ntechnical experts from different organizations to work together on specific assignments and \ndelivering knowledge solutions collectively for DMCs.  \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be safe, nutritious, and affordable food for all in DMCs.11 The outcome of \nthe  TA  by  2018  will  be  increased  knowledge  solutions  on  climate-smart  agriculture,  and \ninclusive and sustainable agribusiness value chain development in DMCs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will support pilot innovations and analytical  works that will  assist DMCs in \naddressing emerging food and nutrition security challenges under ADB\u2019s pipeline projects in the \nANR sector and formulating new partnerships. The TA will finance activities related to pilot \ninnovations, sector analysis, and the evaluations and dissemination of knowledge and best \npractices in climate-smart agriculture and inclusive and sustainable agribusiness value chain \ndevelopment\u2014two of the four priority areas identified by the operational plan.   \n \n9.  Output  1:  Climate-smart  agriculture  interventions  tested  and  introduced.  A \ncomprehensive  review  of  innovative  technologies  and  farming  practices  for  climate-smart \nagriculture, and international best practices in scaling up their adoption, will be carried out. The \nreview will identify several innovations to be tested under ADB\u2019s sector operations. Two or three \nactivities will be selected based on technical feasibility, environmental sustainability, scale of \ndevelopment impacts, required public investments, and the priorities of operational departments \nand DMCs concerned. Once pilot innovations are selected, technical feasibility studies and \nimplementation  arrangements  will  be  prepared  for  their  implementation,  together  with  the \nrelevant  project  teams.  Each  activity  will  be  monitored  and  evaluated,  and  a  report  to \nsummarize the outcomes and experiences of TA activities will be prepared for discussion at \nknowledge dissemination events.   \n \n10.  Output 2: Approaches to develop inclusive and sustainable agribusiness value \nchain  tested  and  introduced.  A  wide  range  of  relevant  technologies  and  innovative \ninstitutional settings, logistics, financing, and business models for agribusiness value chains that \ncan  generate  transformational  impacts  in  ensuring  environmental  sustainability  and  the \nbeneficial engagement of a large number of smallholder farmers will be analyzed and  pilot \ninnovations that can be tested under ADB\u2019s pipeline projects will be identified. A few promising \nbusiness  collaboration  models  for  inclusive  and  sustainable  agribusiness  value  chain \ndevelopment will be selected for pilot testing based on the scale of development impacts, \nrequired public investments, and demand of operational departments and DMCs concerned. \nThese will be implemented together with relevant projects. The outcomes of pilot testing will be \nevaluated and summarized in a report for knowledge dissemination.12 \n \n                                                \n11 ADB has operations in the ANR sector in more than 20 DMCs. Priority will be given to DMCs in which climate \nchange agribusiness development issues are critical. The participation of DMCs is subject to their endorsement on \na no-objection basis. \n12 The proposed TA, particularly Output 2, is an emerging regional cooperation and integration area that would \nfacilitate agriculture trade, benefiting farmers\u2014particularly smallholder farmers, and is in line with ADB\u2019s Regional \nCooperation and Integration Strategy. ADB. 2006. Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy. Manila. ", "4   \n11.  Output 3: Partnerships with centers of excellence developed for innovations and \nknowledge dissemination. Partnerships with both public and private institutions with critical \nexpertise in food and nutrition security in DMCs will be developed. While ADB has signed a \nregional food security partnership agreement with United Nations agencies, new partnerships \nand  collaborations  will  be  sought  with  selected  institutions  that  have  relevant  expertise  to \naddress  DMCs\u2019  outstanding  and  emerging  food  and  nutrition  security  issues. With  current \ndevelopment  partners,  new  types  of  partnerships  will  be  explored,  such  as  a  business \ncollaboration  with  the  consultative  group  for  the  Consortium  of  International  Agricultural \nResearch Centers beyond ongoing research assistance, and collaboration with private sector \ninstitutions to leverage private investment and develop knowledge products.13 The results of \nsuch  activities  will  be  presented  and  discussed  at  various  knowledge  events  for  wider \ndissemination.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). Appendix 2 lists the cost items for the \nproposed TA. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.   The TA will be implemented over 3 years from January 2016 to December 2018.14 ADB, \nthrough  its  Agriculture,  Rural  Development,  and  Food  Security  Unit  of  the  Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department, will be the executing agency. The unit, which \nalso  serves  as  the  secretariat  of  the  Rural  Development  and  Food  Security  (Agriculture) \nThematic  Group  (RDFS  TG),  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall  supervision  of  TA \nimplementation. The TA will require in total 29 person-months of international experts and 39 \nperson-months  of  national  experts.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 3. Engagement of consulting services will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).  \n \n14.   The secretariat will monitor the TA activities and report to the RDFS TG committee for \ndiscussions and decision making as appropriate. It will coordinate with the working groups \nformed under the RDFS TG (Climate-Smart Agriculture Working Group and Agribusiness Value \nChain Working Group) for implementing outputs 1 and 2. Within the scope of outputs 1 and 2, \nthe two working groups supported by the secretariat will develop partnerships with COEs and \nthe private sector institutions. The two working groups will actively engage in the implementation \nof TA activities in coordination with relevant project teams.  \n \n15.  ADB will engage the Investment Center of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations (FAO) through single source selection to assist the two  working groups  in \nproviding technical support to DMCs and ADB; and in carrying out relevant analytical works, \npilot testing, and monitoring under outputs 1 and 2.15 The FAO has the necessary expertise at \nglobal, regional, and national levels to provide technical and operational services to deliver the \ntwo TA outputs. Single source selection is justified because the FAO has (i) multiple expertise in \nagriculture, rural development, and food security that are relevant to ADB\u2019s sector operations, \n                                                \n13 Asia and the Pacific Regional Food Security Partnership Framework signed by ADB, the FAO, and the International \nFund for Agricultural Development in 2010. \n14 Depending on the need for expansion of partnerships and pilot activities, the duration may be extended and the \namount of the TA budget may be increased.  \n15 Arrangements with the FAO will comply with the 1981 ADB\u2013FAO Memorandum of Understanding.   \n ", "5 \nparticularly the leadership role at the Global Alliance for Climate Smart Agriculture and various \nworks for agricultural value chain development in DMCs; (ii) significant teams of technical and \noperational  personnel  in  the  field,  whose  activities  complement  the  TA  activities;  and \n(iii) extensive experience in collaborative work in the sector among DMC governments, ADB, \nand other development partners. The FAO will propose a team comprising 16 person-months of \ninternational and 26 person-months of national consulting services to deliver the TA outputs.   \n \n16.  For output 3, ADB will recruit individual experts (6 person-months international and \n8 person-months national) to assist the RDFS TG working groups in carrying out (i) preparation \nof knowledge products that summarize the best practices and lessons from the TA activities; (ii) \nevents  preparation  to  disseminate  knowledge  to  DMCs  and  within  ADB;  and  (iii) follow-up \nactivities, including project proposal preparation to seek additional funds. In addition, ADB will \nrecruit firms to provide 7 person-months of international and 5 person-months of national market \nresearch  and  agribusiness  value  chain  development  specialists  based  on  the  consultants\u2019 \nqualifications  selection  method  to  carry  out  technical  analysis  required  for  business \ncollaboration model development with COEs and private sector institutions. The use of the \nmethod is justified as the assignments require the services of institutions with highly specialized \nexpertise as well as investment experience in relevant DMCs, for which very few institutions are \nqualified.   \n \n17.  The RDFS TG working groups will identify and select TA activities based on DMCs\u2019 \npriority and ownership, the needs of regional departments, and opportunities with ADB\u2019s future \nfood and nutrition security engagement. The RDFS TG committee will endorse the TA activities \nselected. Once the scope of TA activities is confirmed, consultations will be carried out with \nrelevant DMCs and endorsement by the DMCs on a no-objection basis will be sought prior to \nimplementing any country-specific activities. \n  \n18.  TA activities will be recorded and evaluated, and any good practices and lessons will \nbe complied into working papers and/or policy briefs for wider dissemination. Some outputs will \nbe presented and disseminated at the Food Security Knowledge Forum in June 2016 and other \nknowledge dissemination events, including events at DMC resident missions. Working papers in \nmultilingual forms will be produced for wider dissemination of the TA outputs.   \n \n19.   All disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). ADB will undertake \nprocurement of equipment in accordance with its Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time) in coordination with its Office of Information Systems and Technology and \nOffice  of  Administrative  Services,  where  applicable.  After  TA  completion,  any  procured \nequipment will be disposed of in compliance with the project administration instructions on \nadministering grant-financed TA.   \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor Building Sustainable Food and Nutrition Security in Asia and the Pacific (Phase 1), and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.
