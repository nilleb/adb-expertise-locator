An environmental assessment framework is a core \nAssessment  appendix,  and  checklists  for  screening  the  subprojects  are \nincluded as a supplementary appendix. \n   \nProject Description  The Project will form part of the rural infrastructure component of \nthe Government\u2019s ongoing Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation \nProgram (PKPS-BBM), and it will rehabilitate and improve rural \ninfrastructure in about 1,800 poor and/or isolated villages in less \ndeveloped districts in East Java, Nusa Tenggara East, South East \nSulawesi, and South Sulawesi provinces. The Project will follow a \ncommunity-driven development approach and will benefit about 2 \nmillion people or about 400,000 households. \n   \nRationale  The Government\u2019s National Poverty Reduction Strategy identifies \nlack of basic infrastructure in the rural areas as an underlying \ncause of poverty, and the Medium Term Development Plan 2004\u2013\n2009 (MTDP) identifies investing into rural infrastructure as a key \naction  for  reducing  poverty.  The  MTDP  identifies  investment \nneeds of about $145 billion in infrastructure necessary to maintain \na  sustained  GDP  growth  rate  of  6%  and  for  making  steady \nprogress  towards  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDG) \nduring the planned period. Of these, public sector requirements \nare estimated at about $25 billion for infrastructure, such as that \nfor  rural  areas,  that  is  traditionally  unattractive  for  the  private \nsector. However, investments in infrastructure have seen drastic \ndecline from about $16 billion in 1996 to $3 billion in 2001 and to \n$1.5 billion in 2002. \n \nThe urgency of investments in rural infrastructure has further risen \nwith the Government\u2019s ambitious plan to reduce fuel subsidies. \nThe direct impact on the poor and near poor of, for example, a \nrecent 186% rise in the price of kerosene is potentially substantial. \nImpacts resulting from higher transportation and energy costs will \nraise the general inflation levels. The direct and indirect impacts \ncould further aggravate poverty levels and may lead to slippages \nin progress towards attaining MDGs. To mitigate these impacts \nand aid the poor and near poor, the Government has adopted a \nnumber of measures, including the rural infrastructure component ", "ii   \nof  the  PKPS-BBM,  to  provide  basic  infrastructure  to  rural \ncommunities. On account of resource constraints, the coverage of \nthe PKPS-BBM in 2005 is limited to about 12,800 (about 20%) of \nthe villages in Indonesia, which leaves a large unserved rural \npopulation. In 2006, the PKPS-BBM targets an additional 9,000 \nvillages. The Project will support expansion of the Government \nprogram in an additional 1,800 villages with high incidences of \npoverty and poor rural infrastructure. That will raise the overall \nProgram coverage to 23,600 villages. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project\u2019s long-term objective is to improve welfare of the rural \ncommunities, and the immediate objective is to improve access of \nthe poor and near poor in rural areas to basic rural infrastructure. \n   \nCost Estimates  The Project will be implemented as a part of the PKPS-BBM, \nwhich is estimated to cost about $698 million (inclusive of the \nProject costs and beneficiary contributions). The total costs of the \ngeographic  slice  supported  by  the  Project  are  $60.82  million \nequivalent, of which $10.66 million (18%) is the foreign exchange \ncost and $50.16 million equivalent (82%) is the local currency \ncost. \n \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  Percentage \nExchange  Currency  Cost  (%) \nADB\u2013ADF  9.18  40.82  50.00  82.2 \nGovernment  1.48  4.48  5.96  9.8 \nBeneficiaries  0.00  4.85  4.85  8.0 \n  Total  10.66  50.15  60.82  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ADF = Asian Development Fund. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of SDR35.08 million from the Asian Development Fund \nresources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided. \nThe loan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, with an interest charge of 1% per year during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per year during the remaining period. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government will provide the loan proceeds to communities on \nTerms  an on-grant basis. The grants to the individual villages will be \ndisbursed in three tranches, with the first tranche released upon \napproval  of  the  community\u2019s  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement  plans.  The  remaining  amounts  will  be  disbursed \nbased upon project progress. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 March 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 September 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   ", "  iii\nImplementation  The Project will be implemented over a period of 30 months as \nArrangements  part of the Rural Infrastructure Component in the Government\u2019s \nongoing  PKPS-BBM.  It  will  use  the  existing  implementation \nmechanisms  that  are  in  place  for  that  program.  The  project \ncoordination  and  monitoring  unit  at  the  national  level  will  be \nresponsible for the management, coordination, and monitoring of \nproject activities. The existing provincial- and district-level project \nimplementation units will be responsible for providing social and \ntechnical  facilitation  to  the  communities  in  undertaking  the \ninfrastructure  rehabilitation  and  improvement  activities.  The \nNational  Coordination  Team  and  the  National  Steering \nCommittee, established for the PKPS-BBM, will be responsible for \nproviding guidance and oversight to the Project. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Public Works through its Directorate General of \nHuman Settlements will be the Executing Agency for the Project. \n   \nProcurement  All goods and related services financed under the ADB loan will \nbe  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement under Asian Development Bank Loans. \n   \nConsulting Services  An  estimated  702  person-months  of  consulting  services, \ncomprising  8  person-months  of  international  and  694  person-\nmonths of domestic consultants, will be recruited to assist the \nGovernment in implementing the Project. Eight person-months of \ninternational, and 16 person-months of domestic consulting, along \nwith  an  appropriate  number  of  technical  support  staff,  will  be \nrecruited on individual bases, while the remaining services will be \nprocured through a domestic consulting firm. Consultants will be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants, using the quality and cost-based system and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will benefit about 2 million rural poor in about 1,800 \nBeneficiaries  poor  and/or  isolated  villages.  The  likely  types  of  infrastructure \ninclude  village  roads,  bridges  and  culverts,  village  irrigation \nschemes,  water  supply  and  sanitation  schemes,  and  drainage \nworks.  Main  benefits  are  anticipated  to  include  (i)  reduced \ntransportation costs, (ii) improved access to safe drinking water, \n(iii)  improved  access  to  sanitation  facilities,  (iv)  improved  crop \nproduction,  and  (v)  short-term  and  long-term  employment \ngeneration. The  experience  from  recent  projects  indicates  that \nsuch investments are economically viable, with economic internal \nrates of returns from the rural roads, irrigation schemes, and water \nsupply schemes ranging from 28% to 85%. \n   \n ", "iv   \nRisks and Assumptions  The main risks the Project is likely to face include (i) possibly \ninadequate preparatory activities on the part of the Government, \n(ii) possibly inadequate implementation capacities at local levels, \n(iii) benefits accruing to a few nonpoor, (iv) poor governance, (v) \nsustainability of the policies and investments, (vi) start-up delays, \n(vii)  delays  in  budget  approval,  and  (viii)  lack  of  adequate \ncounterpart funds. The Project design provides for measures that \nshould be able to mitigate or minimize the perceived risks. \n   \n ",

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Rural Infrastructure Support Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The rural areas in Indonesia are home to the largest segment of the population and of \nthe poor. Based on official estimates,1 the number of rural poor in 2004 was about 24.7 million, \nor one fifth of the rural population. That represents a reduction of about 7.6 million (about 7 \npercentage points) from the levels immediately following the 1997\u201398 Asian financial crisis. The \npoverty levels underestimate poverty, however, by not taking into account seasonal or transient \npoverty. An assessment of rural poverty,2 using the difference in incidence between $1/day and \n$2/day headcounts as a proxy for vulnerability, reports that as much as 45% of the overall \nIndonesian population may be vulnerable to periodic shocks. Although separate estimates on \nthe size of the vulnerable population in rural areas are not available, the extent of vulnerability is \nexpected to be at least similar if not higher for the rural population. The vulnerable in Indonesia \nlive with risk as a part of their lives, and shocks at the national or regional levels can sink them \ninto poverty at any time.  \n  \n3.  The  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  paper  (PRSP) 3 and  Medium  Term \nDevelopment Plan for 2004\u201320094 (MTDP) identify lack of key infrastructure as one of the \nunderlying causes of poverty. Poor or difficult access to villages mean that the communities do \nnot receive fair prices for their produce and they pay higher prices for their consumption. Poor \naccess also means a tendency for poor coverage of public and private services and higher \ncosts of accessing outside services. According to the MTDP, about 54% of the rural villages are \nnot connected through asphalt roads, and about one third of these lack year-round access even \nby four wheel drive vehicles. A quick assessment undertaken by the country poverty analysis \nshowed  that  in  isolated  areas  dependent  on  non-motor  vehicle  modes  of  transportation, \ncommunities identified high transportation costs as a major cause of poverty. According to the \nNational Socio-Economic Survey,5 more than  40% of Indonesian households did not have \naccess to clean drinking water or sanitation facilities in 2003. Among rural households, only \n15% were obtaining drinking water from piped or pumped sources, and just 21% had septic \ntanks for final disposal of human waste. The impacts of low levels of access to safe drinking \nwater and lack of adequate sanitation facilities contribute to high incidence of such water-borne \ndiseases as diarrhea, intestinal worms, and skin diseases. The incidence is higher among \nchildren and the elderly, and diarrhea is the second-largest cause of death and stunted growth \namong young children. The infant mortality rate of 35 per 1,000 live births in 2000 is the highest \namong Southeast Asian countries. \n \n                                                 \n1  Maksum, Choiril. 2004.

Adequacy and Sustainability of Rural Infrastructure \n4.  Historically,  Indonesia  has  had  high  levels  of  public  and  private  investments  into \ninfrastructure. However, the investment levels have dropped sharply since the 1997\u201398 Asian \nfinancial crisis. In current terms, such public expenditures declined from about $16 billion in \n1996  to  $3  billion  in  2001  and  to  $1.5  billion  in  2002.  Declining  investments  mean  that \ninfrastructure  expansion  has  slowed  and  existing  infrastructure  has  deteriorated.  A  recent \nassessment6 has ranked Indonesia at the bottom in terms of infrastructure amongst countries \nwith  populations  of  more  than  20  million.  According  to  the  village  potentials  survey,7 the \nproportion of rural villages with year-round access by four wheel drive vehicles improved only by \nabout 2 percentage points between 1993 and 2003 from 80% to 82%. Over the same period, \nthe proportion of villages accessible by asphalt roads declined by about 2 percentage points to \n45% in 2003. Between 1993 and 2003, improvements in access to safe drinking water and \nsanitation in rural areas were relatively larger, at 6% and 22%, respectively. However, the \noverall coverage remains low. \n \n5.  Low levels of investment have also had adverse affects on the sustainability of existing \ninfrastructure and service delivery levels. According to the MTDP, the condition of 46% of the \noverall road network and 57% of the district roads is categorized as lightly to heavily damaged. \nSimilarly,  the  irrigation  schemes,  representing  an  important  infrastructure  element  in  the \npredominantly agriculture-based economy, are in a poor state. Up to 30% of the schemes are \ncategorized as degraded. Appendix 1 presents a more detailed analysis of the sector-related \nissues and experiences. \n \n2.  Opportunities \n6.  The PRSP and Agriculture and Rural Development Strategy8 identify investing into rural \ninfrastructure as a key area in reducing poverty and regional disparities, as well as for achieving \nthe  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs),  as  these  investments  improve  poor  people\u2019s \naccess to services and markets while generating employment. A recent Asian Development \nBank (ADB) study9 confirmed that, in addition to the income-related impacts, investments into \ninfrastructure also generate such non-income impacts as improvements in health, education, \nsecurity, and participation. Taking into account the potential role of infrastructure development in \nreducing poverty, the MTDP emphasizes the need for increased investments into infrastructure \nin general and into rural infrastructure in particular. According to Government estimates, in order \nfor  Indonesia  to  maintain  an  annual  GDP  growth  rate  of  6%  over  the  period  2005\u20132009, \ninfrastructure investments of $145 billion are needed. Of that amount, $25 billion in public sector \ninvestments have been identified specifically in such areas as rural roads, irrigation, and other \nrural infrastructure that are typically not attractive for the private sector. \n \n3.  The Government Strategy and Program \n7.  The vision of the Government is to create an Indonesia that (i) is safe and peaceful, (ii) \noffers justice and democracy to all its citizens, and (iii) is prosperous. This vision is the basis for \n                                                 \n6  IMD World Competitiveness Center. 2005. World Competitiveness Yearbook.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nthe MTDP, which emphasizes policy and institutional reform, an enhanced role and involvement \nof civil society, and active involvement of the private sector in providing infrastructure. The \nMTDP identifies five priority areas for achieving its GDP growth target of 6-7% per year. These \nare (i) supporting job creation and poverty reduction programs; (ii) maintaining macroeconomic \nstability through stable prices, fiscal sustainability, and financial sector reforms; (iii) accelerating \ngrowth of investments, exports, and tourism through reforms to create a healthy business \nclimate  and  flexible  markets;  (iv)  improving  human  resources;  and  (v)  developing  the \ninfrastructure. \n \n8.  In line with its vision and strategy of policy and institutional reforms, the Government has \nadopted a policy of reorienting public sector expenditures from general consumptive subsidies \nto targeted interventions aimed at the poor. The process has been hastened by the rising oil \nprices in the world markets, which led to substantial increase in fuel subsidies.10 Through a \nfour-stage process, the Government has increased prices of fuel over a period of 8 months. As \nof 1 October 2005, the price increases for kerosene, gasoline, and automotive diesel relative to \nthe 28 February 2005 levels amounted to 186%, 149%, and 161%, respectively. The price rise \nfor kerosene, the common fuel for the poor, is anticipated to directly impact the consumption \npatterns of the poor. The poor will also be impacted by increased prices of gasoline and \nautomotive diesel, as these will lead in turn to higher transportation costs and inflation.  \n \n9.  When  faced  with  income-related  shocks,  the  poor  tend  to  liquidate  assets,  borrow \nexcessively,  and  cut  expenditures,  especially  for  nutrition,  health,  and  education.  This \naggravates poverty. The increased kerosene prices may also lead to adverse effects on the \nenvironment, as the rural population may increase its dependence on wood as a fuel. Unless \neffective mitigation measures are implemented, the removal of subsidies may cause slippage in \nprogress toward achieving the major MDGs\u2014including those relating to eradicating poverty and \nhunger, providing safe water, and environmental sustainability. To compensate for the reduced \nfuel subsidies, the Government has initiated a series of targeted interventions to establish and \nimprove  safety  nets,  as  well  as  to  increase  investments  into  health,  education,  and  rural \ninfrastructure.  Some  of  these  are  components  of  the  so-called  Fuel  Subsidy  Reduction \nCompensation Program (PKPS-BBM). The Government has put in place the following main \ninterventions: \n(i)  Unconditional cash transfer. Cash transfers to an estimated 15.5 million poor \nand near-poor households. Allocation of Rp4.7 trillion ($470 million equivalent) in \nthe 2005 budget. \n(ii)  PKPS-BBM\u2013Education  Component.  Operational  aid  to  schools  with  an \nallocation of Rp6.3 trillion ($630 million equivalent) in the 2005 budget. \n(iii)  PKPS-BBM\u2013Health Component. Basic health care and health insurance for the \npoor with an allocation of Rp3.9 trillion ($390 million equivalent) in the 2005 \nbudget. \n(iv)  PKPS-BBM\u2013Rural  Infrastructure  Component.  Allocations  of  $330  million \nequivalent in the 2005 budget and a further $250 million equivalent in the 2006 \nbudget. \n \n10.  PKPS-BBM \u2013 Rural Infrastructure Component. The rural infrastructure component, \nformulated by the regional development directorate of the National Planning and Development \nAgency (BAPPENAS), the Ministry of Public Works (MPW), and the State Ministry of Less \n                                                 \n10 Based on an average crude oil price of about $24 per barrel, the original 2005 budget provided for some $3.2 \nbillion in fuel subsidies. With the rising fuel prices, it was estimated in September 2005 that the annual cost to \nsupport the subsidies for the year would have been over $14 billion. \n ", "4 \nDeveloped Regions builds upon some of the recent rural development projects that take a \ncommunity-driven  development  approach.  The  approach,  closely  following  infrastructure \ndevelopment components of phases I, II and III of the Kecamatan Development Project (KDP) \nand ADB\u2019s Community and Local Government Support Program, provides block grants to the \ncommunities for meeting their priority infrastructure needs. Each village is entitled to a block \ngrant of about $25,000 for meeting its priority infrastructure needs, which may include village \nroads, village irrigation schemes, water supply and sanitation, and small fish landing facilities.11 \nA more detailed account of the PKPS-BBM is presented in Appendix 2. \n \n11.  PKPS-BBM is intended to cover some 28,000 infrastructure projects in poor villages. \nThe 2005 activities, with a budgetary allocation of about $330 million, aim to provide basic \ninfrastructure to some 12,800 villages in 427 of 459 districts.12 Overall, the 2005 activities take \nin about 20% of villages in the country and about 45% of the infrastructure-poor villages. In \neastern islands, where the majority of the districts are classified as less developed, proportions \nof villages not covered by the Program are high. Plans call for 2006 activities to cover another \n9,000 villages at a cost of about $250 million from the Government\u2019s own resources. The \nestimated  costs  of  the  PKPS-BBM  for  2005  and  2006,  inclusive  of  voluntary  community \ncontributions, is estimated at about $638 million, which is anticipated to be supplemented by \nadditional coverage through external assistance.  \n \n4.  Past Rural Infrastructure Initiatives and Lessons Learned \n12.  Indonesia has extensive experience in implementing both dedicated rural infrastructure \nprojects and broader rural development projects with infrastructure-related focus. The external \nassistance for rural infrastructure aggregates to about $14.6 billion. Of that, the respective \nshares  of  rural  development  projects  with  infrastructure  components,  water  supply  and \nsanitation, roads, and irrigation are $2.28 billion, $0.60 billion, $4.95 billion, and $4.77 billion \n(Appendix 3). The community-driven development approach has been tried and tested on both \nlocally  and  externally  funded  projects,  and  it  has  proven  successful.  Some  of  the  major \ninitiatives along the lines of community-driven development include the Village Improvement \nProject (1994\u201396), KDP phases I, II and III (1998 to date), Community and Local Government \nSupport Program (1999\u201305), Poor Farmers\u2019 Income Improvement through Innovation Project \n(2001\u2013to date), and PKPS-BBM Rural Infrastructure Component (2005 to date).  \n \n13.  Despite a large number of ongoing and recently completed projects, only a part of the \nbasic infrastructure needs of the rural population has been met. In aggregate, recent projects \nand programs have covered about 50% of the 68,000 rural villages in the country, which leaves \na large number of rural villages with unmet rural infrastructure needs. Furthermore, due to \nresource constraints, not all basic infrastructure needs will have been met even in those rural \nvillages that have been covered in the past. \n \n14.  Following are the key lessons that have been learned from implementing these recent \nprojects and programs: \n \n                                                 \n11 Both KDP and PKPS-BBM allow for support to development and improvement of one or more infrastructure \nprojects through community-led implementation. Between 1998 and 2004, the KDP has undertaken development \nand improvement of about 56,000 units of infrastructure in some 28,000 villages. A recent evaluation of that project \nputs the average grant size at about $12,000 per unit of infrastructure, or about $24,000 per village. \n12 The Program excludes earthquake and tsunami affected districts as well as some urban districts. In the less \ndeveloped districts, 30 to 60 poor villages per district are targeted by the Program. In the better off and city \ndistricts, however, coverage is a maximum of 20 and 10 villages, respectively. \n ", "5 \n(i)  Pro-poor geographic targeting of project activities increases the poverty impact of \nrural development. \n(ii)  Community facilitation in community planning and preparation is a key factor for \nsuccess  of  projects.  Facilitator  recruitment,  training,  supervision,  and \nreplacement should be undertaken in a timely and synchronized manner. \n(iii)  The communities should be provided close technical backstopping to help ensure \nthat the design of the civil works is appropriate, quality of civil works is high, and \nany adverse impacts on the environment are readily mitigated. \n(iv)  Communities should be thoroughly briefed on administrative- and procurement-\nrelated procedures, so that they can monitor implementation progress. Such \naccountability procedures as public disclosure of budgets, tenders, contracts, \nand terms of reference ensure good governance and help prevent fraud and \ncorruption.  \n(v)  Implementation arrangements should include measures to ensure that minority \ngroups within the community participate and benefit from the Project activities. \n(vi)  Simple fund flow arrangements with direct transfer to the community accounts \nreduce the chances of leakages. \n(vii)  Communities should be trained and facilitated in establishing effective operating \nand maintenance mechanisms. \n \n15.  The PKPS-BBM is in its first year of implementation. A full assessment of development \neffectiveness and adequacy of design and financial systems is due at the completion of 2005 \nactivities. As a part of the Project processing, initial implementation of the PKPS-BBM was \nthoroughly assessed through discussions with key stakeholders, field visits, and examination of \nrelevant  records  and  guidelines.  The  PKPS-BBM  was  found  to  be  well  designed,  ably \nadministered, and with sound financial management systems and fiduciary controls. In addition, \nthe assessment highlighted the following lessons based on the initial implementation: \n \n(i)  Simplified implementation mechanisms and minimal involvement of government \nagencies at various administrative levels have been more successful. \n(ii)  A fixed grant size may not be appropriate for all villages, as average village sizes \nand availability of existing infrastructure greatly differ between provinces and \ndistricts. \n(iii)  Grant size should be based on simple, objective, and transparent criteria so that \nthe community members are aware of the grant amounts to which they are \nentitled. \n(iv)  A longer implementation period with geographic phasing of activities within the \ndistricts will help provide sufficient preparatory activities and avoid bunching of \napprovals for village infrastructure plans. \n(v)  A longer implementation period provides opportunities for periodic stocktakings \nand improving the Project design. \n(vi)  Simple and objective selection criteria can help improve transparency in village \nselection and improve poverty targeting. \n(vii)  Selection criteria for infrastructure should take into account financial and cost \neffectiveness considerations in addition to technical aspects. \n(viii)  In addition to the input and output monitoring, the Project should also monitor \nprocess, impact and outcome. \n(ix)  Project monitoring and evaluation should be provided dedicated resources to \nhelp avoid diverting resources and emphasis during peak implementation periods. \n ", "6 \n5.  ADB\u2019s Sector Objectives and Strategy \n16.  The Indonesia country strategy and program update13 provides strategic support for the \nGovernment in critical areas, including (i) continuing support for implementing the Government\u2019s \ndecentralization policies, (ii) supporting social development, (iii) promoting long-term economic \ngrowth through infrastructure operations and private sector participation, and (iv) furthering \nregional cooperation through investments in the transport and energy sectors. The proposed \nProject is consistent with the strategy, as it aims to support social development and promote \nlong-term  development  in  rural  areas  through  infrastructure  improvement.  In  its  forward \nplanning,14 ADB envisages a two-pronged strategy of pursuing a greater private sector role in \nthe larger infrastructure and an increased public sector role in developing rural infrastructure. \nThe forward plans envisage rural infrastructure development as a key factor in reducing poverty, \nimproving MDG attainment in MDG-deficit geographic areas, strengthening rural-urban linkages, \nand developing rural economies. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The Government has requested ADB to assist in improving rural infrastructure as a part \nof its ongoing initiatives under the PKPS-BBM to mitigate the adverse impacts on the poor and \nnear poor of reduced fuel subsidies. The Project\u2019s long-term objective is to improve the welfare \nof  rural  communities,  and  the  immediate  objective  is  to  improve  access  to  basic  rural \ninfrastructure for the poor and near poor in rural areas. The Project\u2019s design and monitoring \nframework is Appendix 4.  \n \n18.  The Project will implement a geographic slice of the 2006\u20132007 PKPS-BBM where it will \ncover selected provinces in eastern Indonesia with poverty levels higher and achievement levels \non the Millennium Development Goals lower than national averages. The selection of provinces \nalso took into account the number of less developed districts and presence of infrastructure-\npoor villages. The selected provinces are East Java, Nusa Tenggara East, South East Sulawesi, \nand  South  Sulawesi.  The  poverty  profiles  of  the  selected  provinces  are  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. Within these provinces, the Project will focus on less developed \ndistricts15 with high poverty levels, sufficient implementation capacities, and adequate numbers \nof villages that are eligible for support. Within the selected districts, only those villages will be \neligible for support that have (i) poverty levels higher than the district average, (ii) lower density \nof infrastructure than the district average, and (iii) not received support in the past 2 years for \ninfrastructure development. Inclusion of the more specific criteria adds objectivity to the village \nselection, and the use of additional filters helps target remote and isolated villages that have \nbeen bypassed by previous projects/programs. The list of selected districts and villages will be \nfinalized and submitted to the ADB prior to commencement of civil works and release of funds in \neach of the Project districts.   \n \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n15 The State Minister of the Less Developed Regions, in Decree Number: 001/KEP/M-PDT/II/2005, of 7 February \n2005, defines the less developed areas according to criteria that include economic conditions, human resources, \ninfrastructure, financial performance, accessibility, and social conditions. Using these criteria, the decree identifies \n199 districts as less developed. The 2005 implementation of the PKPS-BBM covers the entire Project area; \nhowever, only one third of about 7,600 villages in the less developed districts of selected provinces are being \nsupported. In 2006 and 2007, the non-ADB financed activities of PKPS-BBM will be discontinued in the Project \ndistricts. \n ", "7 \nB.  Outputs \n19.  The Project will comprise two components, namely (i) infrastructure rehabilitation and \nimprovement; and (ii) implementation, monitoring and coordination support. \n \n1.  Part A: Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Improvement \n20.  This component will target the poor and/or isolated villages that have not received recent \nassistance in rehabilitating and improving infrastructure. Following the PKPS-BBM approach,16 \nthe component will provide villages with social and technical facilitation and financial resources \nto meet their priority infrastructure needs. Likely infrastructure projects may include village roads, \nbridges and culverts, village irrigation schemes, water supply and sanitation, and drainage \nworks. Selection of the infrastructure will be subject to technical feasibility, cost effectiveness, \nfinancial  feasibility,  and  screening  for  social  and  environmental  safeguards.  Each  of  the \nparticipating villages will be eligible for a grant of up to $25,000 equivalent for rehabilitating and \nimproving priority infrastructure needs. In cases of larger or very less developed villages, the \nProject  will  adopt  a  more  flexible  approach  by  providing  additional  grants  at  successful \nimplementation of a first grant, which will allow for improving the depth of support. In cases of \nvillages in Alor district of Nusa Tenggara East that were affected by the November 2004 \nearthquake, the villages will also be entitled to further grants at successful completion of initial \ninfrastructure plans. During implementation, the findings of monitoring, evaluation, and special \nstudies will be used to assess the appropriateness of the grant size. If needed, then, the Project \nwill develop a simple, transparent, and objective mechanism for introducing flexible sizing of \ngrants that is linked to per capita infrastructure availability. \n \n21.  The component will follow a three-stage approach, wherein the first stage will include an \nawareness  campaign,  community  mobilization,  and  capacity  building  for  the  communities. \nDuring this stage, a given village community will form a community implementation organization \n(CIO), which will elect a representative committee comprising five members to represent their \ninterests. The members will include at least one female and one member from a minority group, \nif any are present in the village.  \n \n22.  In  the  second  stage,  the  community  will  be  facilitated  by  district-level  public  works \nservices, with the help of village organizers, to assist in planning and designing the priority \ninfrastructures.  The  design  of  community-selected  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and \nimprovements will be based on detailed guidelines prepared for the PKPS-BBM and amended \nto incorporate ADB policies on procurement and safeguards. Upon approval of an infrastructure \nrehabilitation and improvement plan (IRIP), 40% of the grant will be transferred by the district \ntreasury  office  directly  into  the  community\u2019s  bank  account  as  an  advance  payment.  The \nremaining funds, subject to certification of progress by the district and subdistrict public works \nservices staff, will be disbursed to the community in two installments, of 40% and 20%, which \nwill be disbursed at the 36% completion point and the 72% completion point, respectively. \n \n23.  In the third stage, the communities will be facilitated in developing and establishing \noperating and maintenance mechanisms. In the process, the CIO will either reconfirm the \nexisting representative committee or will establish a new committee tasked with operating and \n                                                 \n16 The community-driven development is similar to the approach underlying the recently approved INO-Community \nWater Services and Health Project (ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors on a Proposed Loan to the Republic of Indonesia for Community Water Services and Health Project. \nManila). \n ", "8 \nmaintenance  responsibilities.  The  committee  and  the  CIO  will  be  trained  in  operation  and \nmaintenance of the scheme, and user fee mechanisms will be established, if needed. \n \n24.  The activities under the component will include (i) an awareness campaign to introduce \nthe Project in the participating villages, (ii) capacity building and facilitation for villagers, (iii) \ndeveloping CIOs and building their skills in developing basic infrastructure, (iv) technical support \nto CIOs for survey and design of proposed infrastructure, (v) implementation of the IRIP, (vi) \nestablishment of effective CIO monitoring and reporting mechanisms, and (vii) facilitation for \ndeveloping operating and maintenance mechanisms. \n \n2.  Part B:  Implementation, Monitoring and Coordination Support \n25.  In general, Part B will support the implementation of activities in Part A. Main activities \nunder  the  component  will  include  (i)  establishing  project  management  and  coordination \nmechanisms, (ii) capacity building at the district and subdistrict levels, (iii) providing technical \nassistance  to  districts  and  subdistricts  in  facilitating  infrastructure  works,  (iv)  establishing \neffective monitoring and reporting mechanisms, (v) screening for social and environmental \nsafeguards, (vi) independent financial audits of Project and CIO accounts and finances, and (vii) \nassessing design and management of the ongoing PKPS-BBM. Benefits of the component \nextend beyond the Project, as activities such as assessment of the PKPS-BBM and expanded \nmonitoring and reporting mechanisms will also improve the PKPS-BBM\u2019s effectiveness. \n \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Support for Government\u2019s Ongoing Program \n26.  The Project will support and enhance implementation of the ongoing PKPS-BBM by \nproviding additional resources necessary for expanding its physical coverage and improving its \nmanagement  and  monitoring  mechanisms.  The  Project\u2019s  approach  of  utilizing  the  design, \nmodalities, and implementation structure of the ongoing program will help to align the Project \nwith the Government\u2019s own development program and strategies, enhance ownership, and \nimprove the prospects of achieving common goals of improved service delivery, achievement of \nMDGs, and poverty reduction. By taking advantage of the investments that the Government has \nmade in designing and implementing the PKPS-BBM, the Project will be able to achieve greater \nresource use efficiencies, and avoid duplications. \n \n2.  Building on Past Experiences and Lessons Learned \n27.  The  design  of  the  PKPS-BBM  builds  on  experiences  gained  from  successfully \nimplementing a series of community-based development projects and programs. This design \nadopts a pro-poor geographic targeting of the villages, emphasizes extensive socialization of \nprocedures  and  guidelines,  provides  elaborate  community  facilitation  in  planning  and \nimplementation, utilizes simple and transparent funds flow mechanisms, incorporates checks \nand balances, and emphasizes operation and maintenance of completed works. In designing \nthe  proposed  Project,  the  existing  PKPS-BBM  design  was  further  improved  upon  by \nincorporating  lessons  learned  from  the  PKPS-BBM\u2019s  initial  implementation.  Design \nimprovements include (i) simpler implementation arrangements, with IRIP approvals at the \ndistrict level; (ii) recognition of a need for flexibility in grant size; (iii) provision of follow-on grants \nin villages that are large or devoid of basic infrastructure; (iv) a longer implementation period; (v) \nsimple  and  objective  selection  criteria  for  districts,  villages,  and  infrastructure;  (vi)  due \n ", "9 \nconsideration to financial viability and cost effectiveness in selecting infrastructure works; and \n(vii) expanded monitoring and evaluation to include also process, impact, and outcome. \n \n3.  Poverty Targeting \n28.  The Project will be implemented in those eastern provinces of the country where the \npoverty levels are higher and progress toward MDGs is lower than the national average. Within \nthese provinces, the Project will target remote and isolated villages in less developed districts \nthat are infrastructure poor and have not received any recent infrastructure-related assistance. \nThe systematic approach in selecting project villages and the nature of supported interventions \nshould ensure that the majority of benefits will largely accrue to the poor. Nonetheless, a variety \nof measures will be used to ensure that poor and vulnerable groups are particularly targeted by \nthe  Project,  including  (i)  representation  of  women  and  minority  groups  on  communities\u2019 \nrepresentative  committees,  and  (ii)  use  of  local  labor  and  materials  in  implementing \ninfrastructure. The poverty reduction and social strategy is summarized in Appendix 5. \n \n4.  Public Disclosure and Countrywide Dissemination \n29.  The  PKPS-BBM\u2019s  community-driven  development  approach  has  been  widely \ndisseminated throughout the country and is currently being implemented in about 427 districts. \nThe  detailed  guidelines  for  community  mobilization  and  technical  design  for  typical  rural \ninfrastructure have been developed in Bahasa Indonesia (the country\u2019s national language) and \ndisseminated to the districts and subdistricts. As a part of the ongoing PKPS-BBM, the Project \nwill  benefit  from  the  dissemination  activities  that  have  already  been  completed.  A  media \ncampaign  will  be  undertaken  in  the  selected  villages,  subdistricts,  and  districts  to  ensure \nadequate  awareness  of  the  Project\u2019s  approach  and  interventions.  At  the  village  level,  the \ncommunities  will  make  their  plans,  budgets,  and  financial  records  available  to  the  public. \nSummaries  of  the  plans,  progress  reports,  and  financial  records  will  also  be  posted  on \nsignboards within the villages. A flow of information to the communities will be encouraged by \nrequiring the districts and subdistricts to provide copies of the quarterly progress reports to the \ncommunities, which will help to cross-check the accuracy and completeness of reports. At the \nProject  level,  the  Government  and  ADB  will  disclose  the  Project-related  information  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s public communication policy.17 \n \n5.  Community Ownership \n30.  The Project\u2019s community-driven approach will help develop a sense of ownership among \nthe community members. The experience from past community-driven development projects, \nboth in and outside of Indonesia, shows that strong community ownership is often reflected in \nbetter work quality and voluntary contributions that are far and above the required contribution. \nA recent evaluation18 of rural infrastructure schemes implemented by  communities in KDP \nphases I and II shows that, on average, communities\u2019 voluntary contribution was about 17%.  \n \n31.  Another indicator of community ownership is the better upkeep and maintenance of the \ninfrastructure. Experience suggests that while the maintenance of larger infrastructure is beyond \nthe communities\u2019 capabilities, communities can maintain smaller infrastructure, if the community \nhas been fully involved in all stages of planning and implementation\u2014and including preparation \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2005.

Economic Impact Analysis of Kecamatan Development Program \u2013 Infrastructure Projects. \nJakarta: World Bank.    \n ", "10 \nof  the  operating  and  maintenance  plans.  Selection  of  small  infrastructure  projects,  full \ncommunity participation, and operation and maintenance planning are integral parts of the \nProject.  These  are  anticipated  to  lead  to  strong  ownership  of  infrastructure  and  improved \nsustainability. \n \n6.  Good Governance and Anticorruption Measures \n32.  Implementation  of  infrastructure  works  through  a  community-led  approach  is  the \nunderlying principle of the Project design. The Project clearly recognizes that administration at \nthe village level is the most transparent and democratic in the country and that there are several \nself-governing checks and balances at the village level to militate against corruption. Given that \nthe Project aims to alleviate poverty, the main thrust of the anticorruption agenda has been to \nensure that the beneficiaries directly receive the funds with the minimum amount of delay and \nthat there are no leakages at the village level. The communities will be involved at all stages of \ninfrastructure  rehabilitation  and  improvement.  The  Project  incorporates  good  governance \nthrough features including (i) advance socialization of the overall program objectives so that the \ncommunities understand the intentions, the outcomes, and the process by which funds will be \ndisbursed;  (ii)  a  detailed  and  consensual  approach  to  planning  so  that  the  village-level \nassessments are prepared in a transparent, consistent, and cost-effective manner with clear \nawareness in the communities as to how much they are receiving and for what; (iii) smooth, \ntransparent,  fast,  and  direct  disbursement  and  funds  flow  to  the  village;  (iv)  transparent \nutilization of Project funds at the village level, so that the utilization is adequately controlled with \nregular and transparent record keeping; and (v) comprehensive monitoring and evaluation that \nallows for an independent assessment of the village investment outputs compared to the plan \nand overall program objectives. \n \n33.  Implementation  through  such  a  transparent  approach  is  well  tested  and  proven  for \npromoting good governance. Details from an assessment of existing financial management \nmechanisms and fiduciary controls for the PKPS-BBM are included as Appendix 6. \n \n34.  In addition to the above, from the perspective of good governance practices in the \nimplementing agency, the Project will incorporate specific actions to ensure implementation of \nmeasures agreed between the MPW (then Ministry of Settlements and Regional Infrastructure) \nand the ADB on 11 June 2004.19 The action plan is given in Appendix 7, and its features \nappropriate to the Project design will be incorporated into the loan agreement. Salient features \nof the action plan include (i) training of the national and regional Project staff in Government and \nADB procedures for implementation, procurement, use of consultants, disbursements, reporting, \nmonitoring, and prevention of fraud and corruption; (ii) strengthening of contractual liabilities of \nthe Project\u2019s service providers and suppliers by including enforceable financial liability clauses \nin the contracts; (iii) including a clause in agreements and contracts with communities, service \nproviders,  and  suppliers  on  ADB\u2019s  right  to  audit  the  accounts;  (iv)  publicly  disclosing \ninfrastructure  plans,  budgets  and  cost  estimates,  and  implementation  progress  at  the \ncommunity  level;  (v)  publicly  disclosing  memorandums  of  understanding  arising  from  ADB \nreview  missions  and  regarding  implementation  progress,  procurement,  disbursement, \ncompliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  other  relevant  project  issues;  (vi)  developing  and \nimplementing  appropriate  web-based  information  management  and  reporting  systems  to \n                                                 \n19 Action plan set out in an MOU was developed under ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia \nfor Strengthening the Capacity of Ministry of Settlements and Regional Infrastructure to Combat Fraud and \nCorruption. Manila (TA No. 3842-INO, for $800,000, approved in March 2002). \n ", "11 \nprovide up-to-date financial and procurement-related information; and (vii) independent financial \nauditing for project accounts and to investigate complaints. \n \n35.  Implementation of activities to rehabilitate and improve infrastructure will be subject to \nspecific provisions under the action plan. \n \n7.  Women\u2019s Participation \n36.  Men and women engage in different socioeconomic activities, and consequently their \ninfrastructure needs are not necessarily the same. The Project\u2019s inherent approach will ensure \nequal  benefits  for  both  men  and  women.  Specific  measures  for  ensuring  balanced \nrepresentation and equal participation of genders in all stages of infrastructure rehabilitation and \nimprovement  include  (i)  having  at  least  20%  representation  of  women  in  representative \ncommittees, and among village organizers; (ii) ensuring at least 33% women\u2019s participation in all \ntraining activities; and (iii) screening of IRIPs to ensure proportional employment opportunities \nfor women. \n \n8.  Social Safeguards \n37.  The civil works included in the Project will be limited to rehabilitation and improvements \nto  existing  infrastructure,  and  these  shall  not  involve  resettlement  of  people,  relocation  of \nhouses, or land acquisition.  \n \n38.  The Project will proactively include indigenous people among its beneficiaries. Because \nthe  Project  will  not  involve  negative  impacts  and  will  be  fully  based  on  community-driven \ndevelopment principles, compliance with the ADB policy on indigenous peoples20 will be de \nfacto ensured by the main design and implementation mechanisms. Nonetheless, the selection \ncriteria  for  infrastructure  include  provisions  to  ensure  that  indigenous  people  and  other \nvulnerable  groups  are  part  of  the  capacity  building,  planning,  implementation,  and  post-\nimplementation processes, as well as that they will benefit proportionally from the improved \naccess to rural infrastructure, the training, and construction-related employment opportunities. \n \n9.  Environmental Safeguards \n39.  All schemes selected under the Project at the village level will undergo rigorous technical \nand  social  evaluation  prior  to  actual  project  approval  and  implementation.  By  using \nenvironmental screening criteria specified in the environmental assessment framework given in \nAppendix 8, only those schemes having no or very minimal environmental impacts will be \nselected. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n40.  The Project will be implemented as a part of the PKPS-BBM, which is estimated to cost \nabout $698 million (inclusive of the Project costs and beneficiary contributions). The total costs \n(including taxes, price contingencies, and interest during construction) of the activities for the \ngeographic slice implemented by the Project is estimated at $60.82 million equivalent (Table 1), \nof which $10.66 million is the direct and indirect foreign exchange cost. The balance of $50.16 \nmillion equivalent is the local currency cost. A summary of cost estimates is given in Appendix 9 \nand details are available in Supplementary Appendix B. \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 1998.

The Government has requested that ADB provide funding of $50.0 million, representing \n82.2% of the total project cost. The Borrower will be the Republic of Indonesia. A loan of $50.0 \nmillion equivalent will be provided from ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund (ADF) Special Funds \nresources. The loan will have a term of 32 years and a grace period of 8 years. The interest rate \ncharge on the funds is 1% during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n \n42.  ADB will cover 86% of the foreign exchange cost of the Project and 81% of the local \ncurrency cost, excluding taxes. The Government and the beneficiaries will provide $5.96 million \nand $4.85 million equivalent, amounting to 9.8% and 8.0% of the project cost, respectively. The \nfinancing of local currency costs by ADB is justified by the nature of the Project, which will \naddress regional poverty and vulnerabilities, as well as assist in achieving MDGs in relation to \neradicating poverty and hunger and to gaining access to water and sanitation services. ADB \nfunding will cover the community facilitation, rehabilitation, and improvement of infrastructure; \naudits, studies, and surveys; as well as consulting services. A summary of the financing plan for \nthe Project is presented in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n                       \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  Percentage \nExchange  Currency \nADB  9.18  40.82  50.00  82.2 \nGovernment  1.48  4.48  5.96  9.8 \nBeneficiaries  0.00  4.85  4.85  8.0 \nTotal  10.66  50.15  60.82  100.0 \nNote: Allocation of loan proceeds in the loan agreement will be presented in Special Drawing Rights equivalent. \nSource: ADB and the Government estimates. \n \n ", "13 \n43.  ADB\u2019s higher share of the financing is justified, as the Project will be implemented as a \npart of the Government\u2019s ongoing PKPS-BBM. In the context of overall program, ADB financing \namounts to less than 8% of the costs. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management and Coordination \n44.  The Project will follow the established implementation arrangements for the PKPS-BBM, \nwhich ADB has evaluated and found to be satisfactory. The MPW will execute the Project \nthrough  the  Directorate  General  of  Human  Settlements  (DGHS).  The  existing  PKPS-BBM \nNational Coordination Team and National Rural Infrastructure PKPS-BBM Steering Committee \n(NSC)  will  provide  policy  directives,  guidance,  monitoring,  and  managerial  oversight.  The \nNational Coordination Team is chaired jointly by the Ministers of Coordination Ministry for \nEconomic Affairs and Coordination Ministry for People\u2019s Welfare, and the NSC by the Minister \nof Public Works with members including the ministers for Finance, Home Affairs, Information \nand Communications, Labor and Transmigration, and Agriculture, as well as heads of the \nNational  Planning  and  Programming  Agency,  State  Ministry  of  Less  Developed  Regions, \nNational  Statistics  Agency,  and  the  National  Audit  Agency.  Provincial  and  district  project \ncoordination teams will also have multi-agency steering committees formed by the respective \ngovernors and district heads (bupati). These regional steering committees will have coordination \nand monitoring functions similar to those of the NSC. Chaired by the head of the regional \nplanning and development agency, these shall be made up of heads of the relevant sectoral \nagencies and representatives from local organizations (e.g., parliaments, public organizations, \nnongovernment  organizations,  a  university,  the  press,  prominent  leaders,  and  the  general \npublic). All steering committees shall meet as necessary, and at least twice a year.  \n \n45.  A project coordination and monitoring unit (PCMU) has been established in the DGHS to \nwork closely with the PKPS-BBM multi-agency provincial and district project coordination teams. \nProject  assistance  will  be  administered  through  the  existing  project  implementing  units  or \nSatkers (PIUs) established at the national, provincial, and district levels under the respective \ncoordination teams. The national and provincial PIUs will be supporting both the Project and the \nnon-ADB component. Some additional personnel will be deployed by the Government to help \nundertake such activities as preparing withdrawal applications that will be specific to the Project. \nEach participating village will establish a CIO. The CIO shall be either an existing village \norganization (formal or informal) or a new project organization, as decided by the local village \ncommunity  through  participatory  meetings.  Representatives  of  the  CIO  will  be  elected  or \nreconfirmed by the community and include a head, treasurer, secretary, and technical facilitator. \nThe Project shall engage a full-time village organizer elected by the local community to support \nthe CIO. The CIO shall be legalized by the village head and registered with the subdistrict head, \nwhich is a prerequisite for opening a bank account for the CIO. The CIO will be responsible for (i) \nidentifying social and infrastructure constraints in the village, (ii) preparing a village proposal, (iii) \nimplementing the approved village proposal, (iv) opening a bank account and making a contract \nfor works with the district implementation unit, (v) monitoring on a daily basis the construction \nworks  and  reporting  the  progress  to  the  district  implementation  unit  using  the  project \nperformance management system (PPMS), (vi) preparing invoices and cash management, (vii) \nholding  weekly  meetings  with  the  community  and  providing  copies  of  daily  records  on \ninformation  boards  in  order  to  report  physical  and  financial  progress,  (viii)  maintaining  a \ncomplaints system, and (ix) monitoring and reporting. To support the CIO, a management team \nfor  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  that  is  made  up  of  community  and  village \norganization representatives (excluding the village head) shall be set up in each village. The \n ", "14 \nteam  will  supervise  infrastructure  construction  activities  and  infrastructure  management \n(including operation and maintenance) programs. Community facilitators will assist the CIO and \nvillage organizer in coordinating with the subdistrict team, as well as in overseeing planning, \nselection, design, and implementation of the project activities. \n \n46.  The Project\u2019s organizational structure is in Appendixes 10. \n \n2.  Selection of Village Level Infrastructure \n47.  The selection of a village infrastructure project for financing will be subject to (i) the \nendorsement of a village plan by the entire representative committee, including those members \nrepresenting women and minority groups; (ii) its providing proportional benefits and employment \nopportunities to women and minority groups; (iii) its having a village infrastructure focus and \nleading to improvement in the livelihoods of the poor or near poor; (iv) its having potential for \nimmediate utilization by the poor or near poor; (v) its involving only the rehabilitation and \nimprovement of existing village-level infrastructure; (vi) its demonstrating economic viability and \nfinancial sustainability; (vii) its not requiring land acquisition or resettlement; (viii) its entailing no \nnegative  environmental,  social,  or  economic  impacts;  (ix)  the  construction  period\u2019s  not \nexceeding  3  months;  (x)  evaluation  of  alternative  designs  and  establishing  the  cost \neffectiveness of the proposed design; (xi) its utilizing local labor and materials, and, to the extent \npossible, employing technology that is simple or otherwise appropriate to local conditions; (xii) a \nvillage walk-through demonstrating the nature, location, and impacts of the project on at least \n50%  of  the  village  community;  and  (xiii)  the  CIO\u2019s  having  prepared  an  operating  and \nmaintenance  plan,  and  concluded  a  written  agreement  with  the  district  public  services  to \nmaintain the works. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n48.  The Project activities will begin in April 2006 and will be completed over 30 months. The \nactivities will be undertaken in all the selected districts during the entire implementation period. \nWithin those districts, however, roughly half of the subdistricts will be covered in 2006 and those \nremaining during 2007\u201308. A summary project implementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n4.  Procurement \n49.  Goods and services financed partially or wholly by ADB will be procured in accordance \nwith the ADB Guidelines for Procurement.21 Civil works under Part A of the Project will be \ncontracted  out  to  the  communities  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  for  community \nparticipation in procurement as specified in ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines, with a contract \nceiling of $25,000 equivalent. A summary of indicative procurement packages is in Appendix 12. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n50.  The Project will require an estimated 702 person-months of consulting services. This \nincludes 8 person-months of international and 694 person-months of domestic consulting, which \nwill be supported by technical support staff and village organizers. The relatively large input \nstems  from  the  need  for  capacity  building,  the  assistance  required  to  support  the  highly \ndecentralized implementation arrangements, and the need for intensive interaction with the \n1,800  village  communities.  These  requirements  include  the  services  for  assisting  project \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 2004. Guidelines for Procurement under Asian Development Bank Loans. Manila. \n ", "15 \nimplementation units with preparing quarterly financial monitoring reports, project performance \nmanagement systems, and environmental and social safeguard screening. \n \n51.  Consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  through  firms  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants22 and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging domestic consultants. About 8 person-months of international and 16 person-months \nof domestic consulting services will be recruited on individual bases through direct selection to \nassist in starting up Project activities as well as to assess adequacy of financial management \nsystems and fiduciary controls of the ongoing PKPS-BBM. The remaining services will be \nprocured through domestic consulting firms using a quality-based selection method that requires \nsubmitting a simplified technical proposal with a proposal submission period of 35 days. The \nquality-based selection method is justified to ensure recruitment of highly competent consulting \nfirms with the required mix of specialties, the demand for which has increased considerably due \nto the PKPS-BBM. In case of the consulting services solely financed by the counterpart funds, \nthe borrower may employ other arrangements that are acceptable to ADB. The outline terms of \nreference and details of consulting requirements are summarized in Appendix 13. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n52.  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  and  discussed  with  the  Government. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy23 and specific actions listed in para. 34 are included in \nthe loan regulations and bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the executing agency and all contractors, CIOs, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n53.  The Project is classified by the Government as a national project, where the national \nGovernment will provide the loan proceeds directly to participating communities and district and \nregional governments on an on-grant basis. The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook.24 The  Project  will  use  direct  payments  and  an \nimprest account. Direct payment procedure will be used for payments over $100,000. All other \npayments  will  be  channeled  through  the  imprest  account  to  increase  flexibility  in  project \ndisbursement. \n \n54.  The initial amount to be deposited into the imprest account will not exceed $5.0 million or \nestimated expenditures for the first 6 months, whichever is lower. Liquidation will be carried out \nunder the statement of expenditure procedure, for which the limit will be $100,000. Detailed \narrangements to establish the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedure will be \nmade in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, as amended.  \n \n55.  Sufficient supporting documentation, as defined in the Loan Disbursement Handbook, \nmust be kept at each level of project management to substantiate all expenditures incurred from \n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2005.

Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n56.  The  DGHS,  regional  governments,  and  other  agencies  involved  in  project \nimplementation will prepare and maintain separate records and accounts exclusively for the \nProject.  They  will  register  in  such  accounts  all  receipts  and  payments  for  the  Project  in \naccordance with sound accounting principles and procedures. The CIOs will maintain accounts \nin the format specified by the Project guidelines, and their books and records will be open to \npublic access. The summary of the expenditures will be posted on a signboard in the village to \ninform  the  public.  Annual  project  accounts  will  be  prepared  by  an  independent  auditor \nacceptable to ADB, based on sound and acceptable accounting principles. Audited project \naccounts, audited financial statements, and the audit opinion must be submitted to ADB within 6 \nmonths of the end of the financial year and at project completion. A separate audit opinion on \nthe use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures should be included in \nthe annual audit report. A formal warning will be issued for accounts more than 6 months \noverdue, and disbursements will be suspended for accounts that are 12 months overdue. The \nfinancial statements and the auditor\u2019s report will be in English. In case of any specific complaints, \nthe DGHS will contract an independent auditor, using Project funds, to audit the accounts at the \ncommunity and other relevant implementation levels.  \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n57.  A PPMS will be established at the national and field levels. The PPMS will encompass \nthe following elements: (i) monitoring physical and financial progress, as well as the efficacy and \nefficiency in village infrastructure implementation; (ii) monitoring the level and adequacy of \nvillage participation of various stakeholders in planning and implementing project activities;  (iii) \ncollecting gender disaggregated data on stakeholders\u2019 participation in training and planning, and \nthe accrual of benefits including employment generation; (iv) monitoring social, environmental, \nand  economic  impacts,  including  to  establish  benchmark  information  and  data;  and  (v) \nassessing the impact and utilization of the works. The staff and village organizers will be trained \nto undertake baseline and completion surveys for the individual villages. PPMS findings will be \nincorporated in quarterly project progress reports to be prepared by the PCMU within 4 weeks of \nthe end of the reporting period and submitted to ADB and the NSC. The PCMU will also prepare \nand  submit  a  consolidated  project  completion  report  to  ADB  within  6  months  of  project \ncompletion. \n \n10.  Project Review \n58.  ADB  will  carry  out  regular  loan  reviews,  including  mid-term  and  project  completion \nreviews.  The  reviews  will  focus  on  project  impacts,  particularly  relating  to  institutional, \nadministrative, organizational, technical, environmental, and social aspects. The reviews will \nalso examine compliance with covenants specified in the loan agreement. The DGHS and \nregional governments will make sure that their staffs visit the field frequently and join ADB for all \nproject review missions. \n \n11.  Project Readiness \n59.  The Project will be implemented as a part of the ongoing PKPS-BBM, and hence it \nbenefits  from  extensive  Government-led  preparation  and  experience  from  large-scale \n ", "17 \nimplementation. The implementation arrangements include national-, provincial-, and district-\nlevel offices. The NSC and provincial, district, and subdistrict committees are already in place. \nThe staff at all levels has been trained and is familiar with the approach. Villages in the Project \ndistricts  have  been  exposed  to  that  approach.  The  MPW  has  prepared  and  disseminated \nnecessary administrative and technical guidelines for districts, subdistricts and communities, \nwhich will form the basis for the project administration memorandum. The terms of reference for \nthe consulting services have also been prepared, which will allow for fast-track recruitment of \nconsultants. The Project does not entail any land acquisition or resettlement, which are often the \ncause of delays in starting up of activities. Overall, the Project is in a high state of readiness. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n60.  Investment in priority rural infrastructure will directly benefit about 2 million people or \n400,000  households  in  1,800  villages  in  the  Project  area.  It  will  build  capacities  of  local \ngovernments  in  about  40  districts  in  community-driven  development.  Anticipated  benefits \ninclude (i) economic and financial returns; (ii) improved quality of life, with reduced poverty and \nvulnerability; and (iii) increased community and local government capacities. \n \n1.  Economic and Financial Benefits \n61.  Given the Project\u2019s community-driven development approach, the communities would \nprioritize their infrastructure needs during the implementation, and it is therefore not possible to \nestimate an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project at this stage. There is a \nwealth  of  knowledge  and  experience  in  Indonesia  on  projects  pursuing  community-driven \ndevelopment and undertaking community-level interventions, however, and these could provide \nindicative bases for anticipating economic and financial viability for the key types of project \ninterventions.  \n \n62.  Appendix 15 summarizes the findings of evaluations undertaken on two recent projects \nwith similar approaches and grant sizes. The results indicate that irrigation schemes yielded the \nhighest returns, with the EIRRs for completed schemes ranging from 66% to 85%. EIRRs for the \ncompleted water supply schemes ranged from 28% to 36%, and those for roads and bridges \nfrom 33% to 47%. Using a general income multiplier analysis, the results indicated that, on \naverage, the investments generated additional indirect incomes 17% in excess of the amount of \ncash  directly  injected  into  the  village  economies.  The  results  also  point  to  greater  cost \neffectiveness, with the works undertaken by communities on average costing 56% less than \nsimilar works carried out directly by government agencies or through contractors. \n \n63.  The  experience  on  these  projects  shows  that  the  majority  of  the  civil  works  are \nundertaken using manual labor, which accounts for about 30\u201350% of the civil works costs. \nUsing a conservative estimate of labor accounting for 30% of the village grant utilization and \naverage wage rates for skilled and unskilled construction labor, it is anticipated that, on average, \nan IRIP will generate 100 person-months of short-term employment. The overall short-term \nimpact of the Project in generating employment is anticipated to be about 180,000 person-\nmonths or 15,000 person-years. \n \n64.  On account of the large sunk costs that the Government has incurred in designing and \nimplementing the PKPS-BBM, this Project\u2019s economic and financial benefits are anticipated to \nbe larger than if it was a stand-alone intervention. \n ", "18 \n  \n2.  Social and Poverty Reduction Benefits \n65.  The Project will target poor and isolated villages in less developed districts that lack \nbasic infrastructure and have not received any recent support for developing or maintaining \ninfrastructure. By virtue of poverty targeting, it is anticipated that the selected villages will have \nabove average poverty levels and will be below the national achievement levels with regard to \nMDGs relating to eradicating poverty and hunger and improving access to water and sanitation. \nThe water supply- and sanitation-related interventions are anticipated to reduce time and costs \nspent  on  obtaining  good  quality  water  while  diminishing  the  incidence  and  severity  of \nwater-borne diseases. Improvements in rural roads are anticipated to increase the availability \nand accessibility of education, health services, and natural capital to the rural poor and near \npoor. A healthier population with improved access to services and markets, and with more time \nfreed to engage in economic activities, will have the opportunity to improve its incomes and \nwelfare. \n \n66.  The inclusion of women in planning, implementing and operational processes will ensure \nthat the Project addresses their priority infrastructure needs and that they will benefit from \ntraining activities and employment opportunities. As women in these communities are typically \nand mainly responsible for collecting water, the benefits for women will be larger in cases of \nthose interventions aimed at improving access to safe drinking water. \n \n3.  Institutional Benefits \n67.  The adoption of a community-driven development approach will lead to communities\u2019 \nactive involvement in prioritizing, planning, procuring, implementing, operating, and maintaining \ninfrastructure. This will empower these communities and will prepare them to promote their own \ndevelopment. Improved governance at the local levels will be a result of the transparency in \nimplementation, whereby all decisions will be made by the communities in public meetings, \ncommunity  accounts  will  be  displayed  in  summary  in  public  places,  and  those  community \naccounts will be accessible for public scrutiny. \n \n68.  While the Project would cover villages that have not received any recent support for \ninfrastructure  and  have  little  or  no  prior  exposure  to  community-driven  development,  the \nparticipating districts would have been involved in implementing the PKPS-BBM and other \nprojects pursuing similar approaches. In fact, the Project relies on the awareness campaigns \nand capacity building activities that have already been completed by the PKPS-BBM, and it will \nlimit its capacity building to refresher activities and improvements with regard to monitoring, \ngovernance,  and  safeguards.  The  governance-  and  monitoring-related  improvements  are \nanticipated to spill over to the PKPS-BBM activities being implemented within and outside of the \nProject districts. This will lead to improved targeting and accountability both inside and outside \nthe Project area. \n \nB.  Risks \n \n1.  Adequacy of Government\u2019s Preparatory Activities \n69.  The Project preparation largely relied on the Government\u2019s own preparatory activities. \nWhile generally thorough, these may have been lacking in some areas. The loan fact-finding \nand appraisal missions undertook to assess the ongoing PKPS-BBM to ascertain any such \nweaknesses, and, where needed, additional provisions were added to address these. To further \n ", "19 \nmitigate  risk,  additional  provisions  to  address  any  weak  areas  will  be  identified  by  an \nindependent assessment of the PKPS-BBM planned for December 2005 or by the assessment \nof financial management systems at the inception stage. \n \n2.  Implementation Capacities at the Local Government Levels \n70.  The Project will be implemented in less developed districts of the country where the \nimplementation capacities may not be on a par with those in the country\u2019s more developed \ndistricts. The risk will be minimal, however, as the local governments will benefit from having \nimplemented  the  PKPS-BBM  in  2005.  Thereby,  they  will  have  strengthened  their  relevant \ncapacities.  Nonetheless,  the  Project  provides  for  additional  capacity  building  activities  and \nconsulting services to help minimize risks related to capacity limitations. \n \n3.  Benefits Limited to a Few Non Poor \n71.  Experiences on past rural development projects show tendencies wherein the benefits \nare hijacked by a select few, and the needs of the poor largely remain unaddressed. This risk is \nminimized  by  several  features  in  the  Project  design.  These  include  establishing  the  CIO, \nelecting community representatives and village organizers, ensuring representation of women \nand minority groups among the community representatives, and requiring that the majority of \nthe community endorse the plans. Furthermore, all the civil works will be contracted to the CIOs \nand will be largely undertaken through manual labor. That will help to ensure that the benefits of \ngenerating employment accrue to the community members to the greatest extent possible. \n \n4.  Governance Related Issues \n72.  Infrastructure projects involving procurement of large amounts of goods and services for \ncivil  works  are  generally  prone  to  corruption.  By  adopting  an  approach  wherein  planning, \noversight, and implementation of the civil works rest with the communities, the Project promotes \ntransparency and good governance. In addition, an assessment of the ongoing PKPS-BBM \nundertaken by ADB staff suggests that the existing financial management systems and fiduciary \ncontrols are sound and have adequate checks and balances to minimize the corruption-related \nrisks. The financial management systems and fiduciary controls of the ongoing PKPS-BBM will \nbe thoroughly assessed during the inception phase, and findings will be used to additionally \nstrengthen the Project systems in order further to mitigate the related risks. Governance-related \nrisks will be further minimized by implementing the action plan that had been jointly developed \nby the MPW and ADB to improve efficiency of project implementation, enhance quality of \noutputs, and prevent fraud and corruption. \n \n5.  Sustainability of the Policies and Investments \n73.  The PKPS-BBM is funded by the resources reoriented from the fuel subsidies, which \namount to about $3.0 billion\u2013$5.0 billion for 2005. As a significant proportion of the subsidies \nreduction came into effect in the last quarter of 2005, the total of reoriented funds is anticipated \nto be larger in 2006 and the Government should have no resource constraint for sustaining the \nPKPS-BBM. However, there is a potential risk that a substantial increase in world oil prices will \ngenerate  social  and  political  pressures  on  the  Government  to  increase  subsidy-related \nexpenditures. That would reduce financial headroom for continuing the PKPS-BBM. This risk is \nreal but low. The Government has been committed to its policy, and it has so far been effective \nin countering the adverse impacts of substantial increases in domestic prices by initiating safety \nnets and development programs. \n ", "20 \n \n74.  Lack of adequate levels of operation and maintenance (O&M) could drastically reduce \nthe  useful  lives  and  benefits  from  the  infrastructure  investments.  Experiences  from  the \nCommunity and Local Government Support Sector Development Program and KDP phases I \nand II show that ownership, and O&M are greater when the communities are involved in all \nstages of implementation. The Project\u2019s community-driven development approach is geared \ntowards  involving  communities  in  the  planning,  design,  implementation,  and  post-\nimplementation  stages.  The  risk  is  further  minimized  through  limiting  the  activities  to \nrehabilitation and improvement of existing infrastructure using local labor and materials. Limiting \nthe infrastructure to simple design and focusing on the existing infrastructure, in particular for \nirrigation  and  water  supply,  will  have  the  advantage  that  existing  mechanisms  could  be \nstrengthened through technical and social facilitation. Furthermore, approval of infrastructure \nrehabilitation and improvement will be contingent on preparation of O&M plans. \n \n6.  Start-up Delays \n75.  Because the Project is envisaged to be fast-disbursing and implemented over a short \nperiod of time, its performance will be sensitive to timely start-up of implementation activities. \nPast experience in cases of rural development suggests significant start-up delays could be \nexpected  with  respect  to  establishing  project  implementation  offices  and  project  steering \ncommittees, finalization of funds flow mechanisms, recruitment of consultants, and approval of \nbudgets.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  using  the  existing  approaches  along  with \nimplementation and funds flow mechanisms that are already in place for the PKPS-BBM. The \nuse  of  established  mechanisms  and  trained  staff  while  providing  advanced  action  for \nprocurement of consulting services will minimize the risks of delays in project start-up.  \n \n7.  Delays in Budget Approval \n76.  Ongoing projects have been experiencing systematic delays in release of budget funds, \nwhich leads to a shorter implementation period during a given year. The Government is in the \nprocess of introducing a new budget approval process, which aims to make the funds available \nto the line agencies at the start of the year. Nonetheless, the Project design addresses the \npotential for delays by scheduling the consultant- and facilitator-led community mobilization \nactivities at the start of the year and civil works in the latter part of the year. \n \n8.  Lack of Counterpart Funds \n77.  A recurring problem in the past has been the availability of sufficient counterpart funds. \nThis has led to implementation delays and an inability for projects to keep up with planned \nimplementation schedules. The Government\u2019s strong ownership of PKPS-BBM and the Project\u2019s \nuse of existing implementation mechanisms will help ensure that the Project will maintain high \npriority within the Government\u2019s planning and resource allocation processes. Furthermore, the \nProject\u2019s  requirement  for  counterpart  funds  is  minimal  and  should  not  lead  to  excessive \ndifficulties in maintaining these levels. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n78.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n ", "21 \n \n(i)  The loan and corresponding counterpart contribution, necessary to finance the \nProject activities, will be made available throughout the Project implementation \nperiod by earmarking the funds. The loan proceeds will be disbursed to project \ndistricts and CIOs as grant by direct transfer to local treasury offices. \n(ii)  Selection of the Project districts and villages will be carried out in accordance \nwith  the  agreed  selection  criteria.  The  selected  districts  and  villages  will  be \napproved by ADB prior to implementation of any district level activities.  \n(iii)  The selection of rehabilitation and improvement works for inclusion in the IRIP \nwill be based on the criteria detailed in para. 47, which ensure that indigenous \npeople  equally  benefit  from  the  Project,  and  that  IRIPs  do  not  require  land \nacquisition or involuntary resettlement. \n(iv)  No disbursement will be made for infrastructure rehabilitation and improvement \nunless the works are based on an approved IRIP, and a signed contract between \nthe CIO and the district project implementation unit. \n(v)  Each Participating Village shall establish a separate Project bank account for \nVillage-level activities funded by the Project. Funds will be transferred to CIO \naccount  in  tranches  of  40%,  40%  and  20%  of  the  approved  proposal  for \ninfrastructure improvement and rehabilitation amount based upon verification of \nactual implementation progress by the relevant district PIU. \n(vi)  Specified relevant recommendations of the MOU of 11 June 2004 between the \nMinistry of Public Works (then Ministry of Settlements and Regional Infrastructure) \nand  ADB  on  improving  efficiency,  enhancing  quality  of  project  outputs  and \npreventing fraud and corruption will be implemented by the MPW. \n(vii)  The proportion of women participants will be maintained at not less than 33% in \ntraining programs at village level, and at not less than 20% in the representative \ncommittees and 20% for village organizers. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n79.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board \napprove the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 35,079,000 to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Rural Infrastructure Support Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such \nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nJoseph B. Eichenberger \nVice President \n24 November 2005 \n ", "22  Appendix 1 \n  RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE \u2013 SECTOR ANALYSIS \nA.  Rural Infrastructure Development in Indonesia \n1.  Some 60% of Indonesia\u2019s population lives in rural areas, and rural poverty remains \ngreater than urban poverty. In 2004, 11.4 million or 12.4% of the urban population and, 24.7 \nmillion or 20.0% of the rural population was assessed to be poor.1  More than half of the \npopulation still lives on incomes slightly above the poverty line.2 From the 1970s to the 1990s, \nthere was little difference between poverty rates in the urban and rural areas, as the gap never \nexceeded 2.5 percentage points in either direction. Since, 1999, at which time the gap widened, \nrural poverty has been consistently 8 percentage points above the urban level. There is a strong \nlinkage  between  poverty  and  lack  of  access  to  infrastructure.  Improved  local  community \ninfrastructure can result in better health and education, safer water supply and sanitation, and \nbetter access to economic opportunities. All of these are basic rights stated in the Government's \npoverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), as incorporated into the Medium Term Development \nPlan for 2005\u20132009. The provision of infrastructure for poor communities will also help achieve \nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), namely targets 1, 3 and 10.   \n \n2.  Indonesia\u2019s  present  investment  levels  in  infrastructure  as  a  proportion  of  GDP  are \namong the lowest in the region. In 2003, Indonesia's infrastructure ranking was last among 30 \ncountries with populations exceeding 30 million.3 Total infrastructure spending (including the \nprivate sector) was 7% of GDP before the 1997\u201398 Asian financial crisis and dropped to 2\u20133% \nin 2000. The proportion of budgets allocated to maintenance was cut drastically. In all sectors, \nthere are significant infrastructure deficiencies. Road density levels are 1.6 km/1,000 people, \nwith 56% of the total 240,946 kilometers of district roads classified as damaged. Only 16% of \nrural populations are serviced by piped or pumped water supplies. Electricity consumption is just \n319 kwh/capita, with 45% of households not connected to electricity at all. Some 90 million \npeople (mostly poor) do not yet have access to electricity. Only 3% of urban areas are served with \nfixed-line telephones, and there are just 27 lines per 1,000 people.4 The estimated need for \ninfrastructure investment in Indonesia for 2006\u20132010 is $72 billion ($14.4 billion per annum).5 \n \n4.  Of the 68,816 villages in Indonesia in 2003, some 83% (56,838) are classified as rural. \nDecentralization has led to significant changes in the Government of Indonesia\u2019s approach to \nregional development. Since the central government no longer has the power or resources to \ndirectly support the development of regions in the way it used to, regions are forced to fund \nlarger parts of their own investment needs. Domestic budgets have been insufficient, and the \nGovernment has increasingly turned to funding agencies for support (See Appendix 3.). An \nanalysis of the number of villages supported by the Government\u2019s special Program Kompensasi \nPengurangan Subsidi Bahan Bakar Minyak (PKPS-BBM) and by the ongoing projects of ADB, \nWorld Bank, and Japanese agencies suggests that, even with the Government\u2019s recent focus \non rural infrastructure, less than 50% of the villages are being supported in the peak years. On \n                                                 \n1  Maksum, Choiril, 2004 Official Poverty Measurement in Indonesia.  Jakarta: Indonesia Central Bureau of Statistics. \n2  The poverty line used by Statistics Indonesia (BPS) until 1996 was revised upward in 1996, leading to a 25% \nhigher headcount. Given this high degree of clustering around the poverty threshold, care must be taken before \ndrawing a conclusion that Indonesia is no longer characterized by widespread poverty. \n3  ADB. 2005.

The funding levels are far below the \nrequirements either to maintain existing facilities or to stimulate significant growth.  \n \n5.  The lack of funding for additional services is only part of the problem. In additional, the \nquality of services is poor, maintenance is minimal, and there is little community involvement in \nplanning, design, and construction. \n \nB.  Subsector Analysis \n1.  Rural Roads \n6.  Improving  the  road  transport  network  is  important  for  the  country\u2019s  economic \ndevelopment  and  social  integration.  Providing  rural  areas  with  all-weather  roads  is  a  key \ncomponent of rural development and economic growth, and this would significantly improve the \nquality of life for the majority of people. Roads have considerable impacts on poverty reduction, \nbecause  they  lead  to  higher  agricultural  incomes,  increased  productive  employment \nopportunities, and improved access to economic and social services.  \n \n7.  Although the road network was reported to total 310,026 kilometers in 2000, roughly 5% \nof the population was not reached at all by that network and an additional 3% lacked any \nreliable access to motorized transport. The national roads are mostly (81%) in sound condition, \nwhile provincial roads are less well maintained, and over half (57) of the extensive network \n(240,946 km) of district roads is in poor condition.   \n \n8.  Rural road projects may be expected to contribute to (i) growth in agricultural incomes, \nresulting  from  access  to  higher  priced  markets  and  reduced  spoilage;  (ii)  growth  of  local \neconomies, leading to increased incomes and employment opportunities; (iii) the ability to travel \nto jobs outside the area; (iv) reduced prices for consumer goods and services due to lower \ntransport costs; (v) improved health and longevity from access to hospitals and health services; \n(vi) improved education due to improved access to schools, capacity to attract qualified school \nteachers, and more frequent supervision visits by school inspectors; (vii) improved access to \nagricultural, veterinary, and extension services; and (viii) improved opportunities for participating \nin the wider society outside of people\u2019s home villages.  \n \n2.  Water Supply and Sanitation \n9.  Providing access to clean water and sanitation is seen as an integral part of overall \nefforts to improve health conditions in Indonesia.The country has made progress in providing \n \nclean water and basic sanitation services to its people, but standards remain below those of \nmany other ADB developing member countries. About 55% of the Indonesian population had \naccess to improved sanitation and 78% to an improved source of drinking water in 2000.6These \n \npercentages are below those for such other Southeast Asian countries as the Philippines and \nThailand. \n \n10.  According  to  the  2002  National  Socioeconomic  Survey,  only  about  15%  of  rural \nhouseholds  obtained  drinking  water  from  piped  or  pumped  (borehole)  sources.  The  great \nmajority of rural and poor households still collect their water through shallow groundwater \nabstraction, rainwater collection, or from nearby rivers or springs.The majority of households in \n \nIndonesia use on-site facilities for sanitation, and access to sewerage is virtually nonexistent in \nperi-urban and rural areas. In rural areas only about 27% of households claimed to regularly use \n                                                 \n6  United Nations Development Programme. 2003. Human Development Report, 2003. New York. \n ", "24  Appendix 1 \ntoilet facilities, and only 21% had septic tanks for final disposal of human waste. As with water, \nthe number of people with lack of access to adequate sanitation is much higher in rural areas \nand among the poor. \n \n11.  Many rural and peri-urban areas in Indonesia have priority disease profiles that include \ndiarrhea, intestinal worms,skin diseases, and other water-related diseases such as malaria and \n \ndengue. Poor people in remote rural areas\u2014and particularly the children, women, and elderly \namong them\u2014are more affected than others. While infant mortality rates under 5 years of age \nhave decreased substantially (from 145 per 1,000 live births in 1967 to 35 in 2000), these are \nstill above those of such other Southeast Asian countries as the Philippines (30) and Thailand \n(25). Diarrhea remains the second most common cause of death among young children, and it \nis the main reason that children\u2019s growth is stunted (particularly at 12\u201324 months of age). The \nsituation  results  from  inadequate  levels  of  access  to  clean  water  supply  and  sanitation, \ncombined with poor hygienic practices and behaviors. \n \n3.  Irrigation and Drainage  \n12.  Agriculture in Indonesia is dominated by irrigated rice. About 82% of the rice produced in \nthe country is grown under irrigation. Of the total irrigated area, 5.0 million hectares are publicly \nmanaged and 1.2 million hectares, all comprising small systems, are managed by farmers. The \naverage cropping intensity is 155%, with an average paddy yield of about 4.5 metric tons per \nhectare. Investment in irrigation and drainage infrastructure was a major component of the \nGovernment\u2019s  agriculture  and  rural  development  strategy  from  1969  to  1999.  Irrigation \ninvestments were economically efficient, and these helped to improve food security and reduce \nrural poverty. As a result of these investments, rice production increased at an annual rate of \n4.8%.  Intensive  cultivation  of  rice,  a  labor-intensive  crop,  increased  rural  incomes  and \nsubstantially contributed to reducing the incidence of rural poverty from 40% in 1970 to 16.5% in \n1997.  About  43%  of  the  country\u2019s  labor  force  is  employed  in  agriculture,  mostly  in  rice \nproduction and related activities. \n \n13.  Mobilizing communities to participate in the irrigation development process is recognized \nas  being  key  to  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  of  existing  irrigation  assets  and \nappropriate development of new infrastructure. Currently, Government financing is significantly \nbelow levels necessary to maintain the existing systems. Some 60\u201380% of the available budget \nis absorbed by regional staff salaries, while the remainder goes to emergency repairs and \nrehabilitation. \n \nC.  Rural  Infrastructure  Participatory  Community  Development  Experience  in \nIndonesia \n1.  Recent ADB Project Design \n14.  The  generation  of  projects  formulated  under  decentralization  has  concentrated  on \nimproving service delivery mechanisms and standards. Many of these new generation projects \nwere community-based projects and achieved significant success at the community level. The \nparticipatory evaluation carried out as part of the country assistance program evaluation for \nIndonesia in September 2005 suggests that projects with strong participatory components have \nbeen effective in supporting village-level decentralization. In these community projects, project \nprocesses have played an important part in promoting greater transparency and community \nauthority in decision making, as well as to make communities feel empowered to challenge \nvillage  government  for  greater  political  and  financial  accountability.  Appendix  3  gives  an \n ", "  Appendix 1  25 \nindication of the wealth of experience in rural infrastructure development in Indonesia, and three \nrecent projects are described below. \n \n2.  Community and Local Government Support Program (CLGS) \n15.  The pro-poor CLGS7 program successfully helped to build capacities among village \ncommunities to identify, plan, implement, and manage small-scale infrastructure projects. It also \naddressed governance-related issues of participation, transparency, and accountability. Local \ngovernments demonstrated their strong appreciation for the Project and its contributions to \nvillage development and the building of capacities in handling bottom-up development with a \nlarge  number  of  community  groups.  The  communities  and  particularly  the  local  women\u2019s \norganizations were a driving force for subproject identification, planning, and implementation. \n   \n16.  In 79 districts, CLGS supported labor intensive construction of 17,237 public facilities. It \ngenerated 11 million workdays8 for 378,000 participants. The work was in the areas of (i) water \nsupply, (ii) drainage, (iii) irrigation, (iv) local roads and bridges (60%), (v) public toilets, (vi) \nmarkets, (vii) school buildings, (viii) sanitation (solid waste handling or disposal), and (ix) water \ntransport facilities such as piers and docks. Loan utilization was effective and efficient. The \nCLGS program\u2019s community-based development efforts are known for their high degree of \ntransparency. Communities have added substantially through additional noncash contributions, \namounting  occasionally  to  2\u20133  times  the  value  of  the  project  funding.  The  contribution  of \ncommunities  has  diminished  the  need  for  contractors,  and,  through  the  mechanism  of \ncommunity  supervision,  reduced  costs  for  subprojects.  Communities  have  been  willing  to \ncommit to operating and maintaining facilities built under the Project.  \n \n3.  Kecamatan Development Project (KDP)  \n17.  The  Kecamatan  (subdistrict)  Development  Project  is  the  longest-running  externally \nfunded community rural infrastructure and livelihoods project in Indonesia. Its goals are to \nalleviate  poverty  by  raising  rural  incomes,  to  strengthen  local  government  and  community \ninstitutions, and to promote good governance. Through its three phases and with funding of \nnearly $700 million, the KDP has so far provided some 56,000 units of infrastructure to about \n28,000 villages.9 \n \n18.  By pushing decision making down to the lowest levels, the KDP empowers the rural poor \nand encourages more democratic and participatory forms of local governance. All KDP activities \naim at allowing villagers to make their own choices about the kinds of projects that they need \nand want. The program gives power to communities by placing funds and the planning and \ndecision-making processes directly under their control. The Project devotes extensive resources \nfor social and technical facilitation at the village level, which can typically be 4 to 6 months long. \nIn open public meetings, villagers decide upon a maximum of two proposals for forwarding to \nthe final round of subdistrict-level decision making. Later, during the subdistrict-level meetings, \nelected representatives of all villages select proposals for allocation of funds. In cases of the \nselected proposals, the block grants are provided directly to the villages for undertaking small-\nscale infrastructure, and social and economic activities. While the KDP does not fix the size of \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1999.

Infrastructure projects (roads, bridges, clean water supply, sanitation units, irrigation \nsystems, markets, etc.) received about 76% of KDP investments and economic activities 23%. \nThe remaining 1% has been utilized for education and health activities. Although the KDP \nadopts  an  open  book  approach  to  infrastructure  selection,  the  most  common  choices  for \nconstruction are village roads and bridges (44%), water supply (10%), electrification (8%), \nsanitation (6%), and irrigation (3%). The evaluations show that some 54% of the participants of \nvillage  meetings  were  poor,  and  some  70%  of  the  workforce  was  donated  by  the  poor \npopulation. The high ownership of the project is demonstrated by contributions of the villagers, \ni.e., some 17% of project costs. KDP has also demonstrated strong benefits in achieving value \nfor money, good implementation quality, appropriate selection of infrastructure, good design and \ncommunity  involvement  in  operation  and  maintenance.  The  evaluations  undertaken  by  the \nWorld  Bank  rate  the  outcome  as  highly  satisfactory,  sustainability  likely,  and  institutional \ndevelopment impacts as high.  \n \nD.  Lessons Learned \n1.  Key Experience from Rural Development Projects \n21.  Community-driven  rural  development  programs  operating  on  principles  of  local \nempowerment,  participatory  governance,  demand-responsiveness,  greater  downward \naccountability, and enhanced local capacity have been successfully implemented in Indonesia. \nExperience has shown that, given clear and appropriate implementation arrangements, access \nto information, and adequate capacity and financial support, poor men and women, working in \npartnership with local governments and other supportive institutions, can effectively organize in \norder to identify community priorities and implement works addressing local problems. \n22.  Pro-poor  targeting  of  villages  increases  the  poverty  impact  of  rural  development. \nImplementation arrangements need to ensure that within a participating community the vulnerable \ngroups benefit directly during implementation. \n \n2.  Demand-Driven, Community-Based Development \n23.  Key lessons learned from demand-driven, community-based development in Indonesia \nand other Asian countries center on the importance of (i) manageable geographic coverage of a \nproject; (ii) a simple technology menu for communities to chose from; (iii) engagement of \ncommunities  in  the  whole  project  cycle;  (iv)  extensive  use  of  community  facilitators;  (v) \ncommunity contributions for construction, and full responsibility for operation and maintenance \ncosts; (vi) close monitoring of construction quality and transparent project administration and \nprocurement  procedures;  and  (vii)  community  participation  in  monitoring  and  evaluation \nactivities.       \n \n3.  Project Design and Implementation \n24.  Key lessons in project design are describe below: \n(i)  It is helpful to simplify implementation and to minimize government agencies\u2019 \ninvolvement at various administrative levels. \n(ii)  Recent decentralization poses a challenge, in that more hierarchical levels want \na  say  in  project  implementation.  Advantageous  is  to  have  a  single  project \n ", "  Appendix 1  27 \nmanagement organization with sufficient authority to resolve coordination and \nimplementation  issues  in  a  timely  manner.  Where  feasible,  decision  making \nshould be delegated to lower levels. \n(iii)  Fund channeling arrangements must be simple and directly to the accounts of \nthe village organizations, bypassing other institutions where it could be leaked. \n(iv)  Community facilitators represent a key factor in ensuring a project\u2019s success, as \nthey  are  responsible  for  community  planning  and  preparation  before  the \nconstruction  of  facilities.  Facilitator  recruitment,  training,  supervision,  and \nreplacement needs to be delivered in a timely and synchronized manner. \n(v)  Communities should be encouraged to increase their voluntary contributions.  \n(vi)  Work  quality  needs  to  be  monitored.  Low  quality  of  construction  has  been \nattributed to requirements to use unskilled and untrained village labor, combined \nwith lack of supervision. \n(vii)  Monitoring  of  participating  consultants,  nongovernment  organizations, \ngovernment agencies, and private sector organizations is crucial. Communities \nshould be adequately trained to demand and recognize high quality construction \nand  assistance.  In  addition,  professional  and  regular  independent  quality \nmonitoring and control of activities is needed. \n(viii)  Ensuring full transparency and public accountability of project administration and \nprocurement is crucial to stimulating community participation and commitment to \nproject policies and procedures. \n(ix)  Sectoral  projects  are  notoriously  slow  and  cumbersome  in  implementation, \nleading  to  great  frustration  among  initially  very  motivated  communities.  To \naddress this, advance actions well in advance of project implementation are \nneeded in establishing and staffing central- and district-level project offices and \nrecruiting central-level consultants. \n(x)  Administration  and  procurement  procedures  should  be  clearly  explained  to \ncommunities so that they are capable of monitoring progress from their side, as \nwell. Such accountability procedures as public disclosure of budgets, tenders, \ncontracts, and terms of reference will ensure good governance and help prevent \nfraud and corruption. \n \n \n \n \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nRURAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT THROUGH THE FUEL SUBSIDY REDUCTION \nCOMPENSATION PROGRAM \n \nE.  Background \n1.  The  Medium  Term  Development  Plan  (MTDP)  outlines  the  need  for  increasing \ninvestments in rural infrastructure development to reduce poverty in the rural areas. In a broader \ncontext, MTDP envisages reorienting public expenditures from consumption subsidies to more \ntargeted support for the poor and near poor. At the end of 2004, the Government announced \nplans to increase fuel prices and use savings in fuel subsidies for poverty reduction programs \ncovering  the  areas  of  health,  education,  nutrition,  and  rural  infrastructure  development. \nPreparatory  activities  then  began  for  various  initiatives,  including  the  rural  infrastructure \ncomponent of the Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation Program (PKPS-BBM).  \n \nF.  Program Formulation \n2.  The Program formulation spanned a period of 6 months (January\u2013June 2005). Guided \nby  the  National  Planning  and  Development  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  the  initial  preparation \ninvolved  developing  the  Program\u2019s  underlying  principles  and  basic  framework,  as  well  as \nassessing demand for rural infrastructure and implementation capacities. In the later stages, the \nfocus was mainly on defining the detailed program scope and implementation arrangements. \n \n3.  Development of Program Framework. The regional development directorate of the \nBAPPENAS,  tasked  with  coordinating  and  implementing  roles  on  several  ongoing  and \ncompleted rural development projects, was a key player in developing the basic framework for \nsupporting rural infrastructure development. The preparation, largely utilizing the Government\u2019s \nown capacities, involved an extensive process of consultations with the implementing agencies \ninvolved in such successful community-driven development projects as ADB\u2019s Community and \nLocal Government Support (CLGS) program, World Bank\u2019s Kecamatan Development Project \n(KDP), and Japan Bank for International Cooperation\u2019s Rural Area Infrastructure Development \nProject. The initiative draws upon the strengths of these successful programs for alleviating \npoverty  by  raising  rural  incomes,  strengthening  local  institutions,  and  promoting  good \ngovernance.  The  framework  for  the  support,  based  on  a  community-driven  development \napproach, was completed in February 2005. The framework\u2019s approval and announcement of \nthe 1 March 2005 fuel price increase marked the start of the more detailed stage of preparation. \n \n4.  Assessment of Potential Demand. The BAPPENAS-led team undertook an extensive \neffort to identify infrastructure-deficient villages. Using 2003 data from the village potentials \nsurvey,1 the core design team used per capita availability of infrastructure and other indicators \nto identify villages that were deficient in the basic infrastructure. In total, about 28,000 villages \nwere identified as infrastructure deficient. The results also indicated a strong correlation of poor \nand remote villages with lack of basic infrastructure. The village potentials survey, however, only \nreports on the presence of infrastructure and does not report on the adequacy or condition of \nexisting infrastructure, which suggests that actual demand for rural infrastructure-related support \nmay be larger than reported by the analysis. \n \n5.  Assessment of Implementation Capacities. As part of the Program formulation, the \ncore design team also undertook to assess the implementation capacities compared to those \n                                                 \n1  The annual survey is conducted by the Bureau of Statistics and reports key information for every village in the \ncountry. It reports key socioeconomic and poverty data as well as each village\u2019s available assets and resources. \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \nthat were required by the ongoing community-driven development projects and programs. The \nassessment determined that implementation on a vast scale required strengthening capacities \nin social and technical facilitation. Capacities in weak areas have been reinforced by training \nand redeploying staff resources as well as by recruiting consultants. The assessments also \nidentified the traditional funds flow mechanisms as inadequate to ensure fast, direct, and simple \ndisbursements,  as  well  as  to  mitigate  risks  of  leakages  and  corruption.  Learning  from \nexperience on the KDP, CLGS, and other successful community-driven development projects, \nspecial funds flow mechanisms were established for the Program. These are described and \nanalyzed in Appendix 6. \n \n6.  Development of Detailed Program Scope and Implementation Arrangements. This \npreparatory stage, envisaged by the framework to take about 4 months, was undertaken by the \nMinistry of Public Works with the help of consultants in key areas and included (i) identifying the \ndetailed scope, (ii) preparing detailed implementation plans, (iii) formulating and establishing \ndetailed  implementation  arrangements,  (iv)  preparing  work  plans  and  a  budget,  and  (v) \npreparing detailed implementation and technical guidelines for the beneficiaries and the staff. \n \nG.  Program Coverage and Village Selection \n7.  Given funding constraints and limitations in implementation capacities, about 12,800 of \nthe 28,000 infrastructure-poor villages could be included in the 2005 phase. Distribution of the \nresources between the districts was governed by objective criteria based on a given district\u2019s \ndevelopment status. The districts across the country were categorized into (i) less developed or \ndisadvantaged, (ii) better off, and (iii) kota (cities). Within each of these categories, the districts \nwere further subdivided into four subcategories based on development status and the economic \nand fiscal situation. The less developed or disadvantaged category was accorded the highest \npriority, and, depending on the subcategorization, within each of the districts, 40 to 55 villages \nwere selected for the 2005 phase. In the better off districts, the coverage ranged from 20 to 35 \nvillages per district and it was 5 to 20 villages in each of the city districts. \n \n8.  While  the  2005  phase  covered  some  427  of  the  459  districts  in  the  country,  the \nproportion of infrastructure-deficient villages that have so far been selected for the Program is \nroughly 45%. The planned coverage for the 2006 phase is about 11,000 villages, including \n1,800 villages through the proposed Rural Infrastructure Support Project. \n \nH.  Program Approach and Scope \n9.  Similar  to  the  KDP  phases  I,  II  and  III,  the  CLGS  program,  and  the  Rural  Area \nInfrastructure  Development  Project,  the  Program  adopts  a  community-driven  development \napproach.  Similar  to  the  village  infrastructure  development  activities  in  these  projects,  the \nProgram empowers communities to prioritize their infrastructure needs, plan and design the \ninfrastructure, undertake the implementation, and operate and maintain the infrastructure. \n \n10.  The  PKPS-BBM  comprises  two  subcomponents:  (i)  infrastructure  works  and  (ii) \nsafeguarding or management and coordination. Their 2005 budget allocations were $320 million \nand  $10  million,  respectively.  Like  the  KDP  and  other  similar  projects,  the  infrastructure \ndevelopment subcomponent includes providing block grants to the communities for addressing \npriority infrastructure needs from an open menu of access, social, and productive infrastructures. \nExperience from the KDP and other past projects suggests that the typical priorities of the \nvillage population include village roads, village irrigation schemes, water supply and sanitation, \nmarkets, rural electrification, and small fish landing facilities. As in the KDP, each village is \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \nentitled to a block grant of about $25,000, which could be used for one or more of the village\u2019s \ninfrastructure-related priorities. The eligible expenditures under the block grant would include \nmaterials, labor, and equipment rental. \n \n11.  Similar to the KDP and other similar projects, the infrastructure works are supported by \nclose social and technical facilitation. The implementation follows a three-step approach: (i) a \nsocialization, mobilization, and capacity building stage; (ii) an infrastructure implementation \nstage;  and  (iii)  an  operation  and  maintenance  stage.  In  the  first  stage,  the  community \nimplementation organizations (CIOs) are facilitated in prioritizing the infrastructure needs, and in \nplanning and designing the infrastructure. The CIOs elect a representative body to represent \ntheir interests and act in their behalf. CIO members are trained in record keeping, construction \nand supervision, and operation and maintenance. \n \n12.  In the second stage, the communities, with technical facilitation from district-level public \nworks services, undertake the development of priority infrastructure. All works are undertaken \nby the CIOs utilizing their own labor and local equipment and materials. The Program, like the \nKDP, follows the approach of payment based on plans rather than actual expenditures, and \ndisburses 40% of the block grant upon approval of the proposal and signing of the contract \nbetween the CIO and the district government. Disbursements to the CIO are made directly to \nthe CIO account by the treasury. Disbursement of the next tranche of 40% is contingent on \nverifying progress of at least 36% against the plans. Similarly, the last tranche is released at \nverification of at least 72% progress. \n \n13.  In  the  third  stage,  communities,  with  social  and  technical  facilitation,  develop  and \nestablish the operating and maintenance mechanisms. In the process, the CIO either reconfirms \nthe existing representative committee or establishes a committee that is tasked with operation \nand maintenance responsibilities. The committee and the CIO are trained in operating and \nmaintaining the scheme, and user fee mechanisms are established, if needed. \n \n14.  The PKPS-BBM includes a provision for a year-end independent assessment of the \ndesign\u2019s soundness and effectiveness, as well as of the quality of the project outputs and \nimpacts.  This  is  to  be  coordinated  by  the  Coordinating  Ministry  of  People\u2019s  Welfare  and \nundertaken  by  universities  in  the  provinces  concerned.  The  assessment  will  look  for \nweaknesses and strengths in the Program and identify lessons to incorporate into the 2006 \nphase. \n \nI.  Implementation Progress \n15.  Based  on  past  experience  from  the  KDP and  other  community-driven  development \nprojects, the Program included a pre-implementation phase that focused on ensuring that (i) the \nimplementation  arrangements  were  fully  in  place;  (ii)  the  comprehensive  implementation, \nfinancial  and  technical  guidelines  and  manuals  were  prepared  and  disseminated;  (iii)  the \nselection of villages in all districts was completed; (iv) the socialization was completed at the \ndistrict and subdistrict levels; and (v) the facilitators were recruited. \n \n16.  At the time of the parliament\u2019s approving the budget in June 2005 and of releasing the \nfunds  in  July  2005,  the  Program  was  in  a  high  state  of  readiness.  The  implementation \narrangements were already in place, and national, provincial, district, and subdistrict staff had \nalready  been  trained  in  the  implementing  procedures.  Even  with  completion  of  the \npre-implementation  activities,  the  Ministry  of  Public  Works  adopted  a  prudent  approach  to \nimplementation to allow for adequate preparation of communities and for learning from the initial \n ", "  Appendix 2  31 \nimplementation experience. The focus in July\u2013August was to socialize the Program to the \nselected villages and to kick off forming the CIOs. Disbursement of grants to CIOs only started \nin September 2005. As of mid-October 2005, the Program had initiated activities in almost all \n12,800 villages and had mobilized 12,376 village organizers. CIOs had been formed in over \n96% of the villages, while design and costing had been completed in about 91% and 82% of the \nvillages, respectively. Contracts between CIOs and the Program had been signed for 67% of the \nvillages, and 48% of the CIOs had already received the first tranche. In total, roughly $63 million \nhave so far been disbursed to CIOs. The initial feedback suggests that grant utilization within \ncommunities has been fast, and a sizable proportion of the communities are in the process of \nrequesting the second tranche. \n \nJ.  ADB\u2019s Assessment of the PKPS-BBM \n17.  Given that findings of the Government\u2019s planned assessment of the PKPS-BBM will not \nbe  available  until  early  2006,  the  Project  team  ndertook  preliminary  assessment  of  the \nimplementation capacities, financial management and fiduciary controls, and implementation \nprogress. In this regard, the loan fact-finding and appraisal missions held discussions with the \ncore program design team, core implementation team at the national level, consultants assisting \nin the implementation, the independent monitoring and evaluation team, and communities in \nEast Java and Benten provinces. In addition, the Project team also met with key people involved \nin  managing  other  ongoing  community-driven  development  projects  and  programs.  The \npotential number of villages that have not been assisted by the PKPS-BBM was assessed, and \nthis was found to far exceed the number of villages that will be covered by the Project (Table \nA2.1). \n \nTable A2.1: PKPS-BBM 2005 Coverage and Potential Demand for 2006-2007 Phases \n \nNumber of  Number of  Number of  Number of \nLess  Villages in Less  Villages Covered  Villages \nDeveloped  Developed  by 2005 PKPS- Unserved by \nProvince  Districts  Districts  BBM  PKPS-BBM \nEast Java  8  1,515  427  1,088 \nNusa Tenggara East  14  2,332  811  1,521 \nSouth East Sulawesi  8  1,474  340  1,134 \nSouth Sulawesi  13  1,319  466  853 \nOverall  43  6,640  2,044  4,598 \nPKPS-BBM = Fuel Subsidy Reduction Compensation Program. \nSources: Decree of the State Minister of the Less Developed Regions, Number: 001/KEP/M-PDT/II/2005 of 7 \nFebruary 2005 and PKPS-BBM Reports. \n \n18.  The Project team\u2019s assessments indicate that the Program design is effective and cost \nefficient, and that it takes into account major lessons learned from the past and ongoing projects \nand  programs.  The  proposed  transaction  costs  were  found  to  be  either  lower  than  or \ncomparable to those for similar projects and programs. The funds flow mechanisms were found \nto  be  simple,  efficient,  and  effective  with  minimal  scope  for  leakages.  The  preliminary \nassessment identified some lessons from the initial implementation, which are listed in para. 15 \nof the main text. In addition to the preliminary assessment undertaken by the Project team, \ninformation for further improving the Program and the proposed Project\u2019s design will come from \nthe  year-end  independent  assessment  of  the  Project  design  effectiveness  and  from  the \nassessment of financial management systems and fiduciary controls at the inception stage. \n \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \nMAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO RURAL  \nINFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT (1970\u20132005) \n($ million) \n \n \nItem  Amount  \nA.

This chapter notes the welfare of these areas needs greater \ngovernment concern for their development. These are areas (i) with limited access to transportation to connect them \nto more developed areas, (ii) lacking in human and natural resources, (iii) having low and scattered populations, and \n(iv) not having been given priority by regional government because they are not deemed as having revenue \ngenerating potential. These are areas in an unequal race, lacking institutional infrastructure to support sustainable \neconomic development, and underserved by public services. Rural infrastructure, access roads, fish landing sites, and \nimproved markets are all fundamental underpinnings for reducing rural poverty. \n \nThe Country Poverty Assessment and Poverty Partnership Agreement identify regional disparity and inadequate rural \ninfrastructure as key poverty reduction issues. In addressing regional inequality, the Poverty Partnership Agreement \nspecifies that \u201cpro-poor or inclusive growth also requires improvement in regional equity through balanced regional \ndevelopment\u201d and \u201ctargeted support of weaker local governments is required to prevent worsening of regional \ninequity.\u201d The Poverty Partnership Agreement pledges to support the Government in achieving good growth by \n\u201c...increasing the productivity of the poor through empowerment and the development of infrastructure especially in \nrural and remote areas,\u2026\u201d Community-driven development of rural infrastructure is the type of activity envisioned \nunder the partnership agreement. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                Targeting Classification:   Targeted Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe targeted districts belong to the category designated by the Government as disadvantaged. These districts are \npoor in terms of human and natural resources, with limited access to economic centers that could spur their \ndevelopment, and require additional attention by the Government. Their common attributes are high levels of poverty, \nlow participation rates in school, low levels of education in the working age population, high dependence on \nagriculture, and low access to safe water. The proposed Project provides essential village infrastructure, selected and \ndeveloped by the community from a menu of infrastructure. The menu ensures that the infrastructure contributes to \npoverty reduction and achievement of Millennium Development Goal needs, the benefits are widely captured, and \nlocal public works offices have the capacity to provide technical support. The absence of village infrastructure is a \nstrong correlate for poverty. A nonpoor household is 1.4 times more likely to be living in a village accessible by road \n12 months out of the year and 1.4 times more likely to be living in a village with electricity. The participatory process \nensures that within this menu, priorities of both the men and women and poor and nonpoor are met and a sense of \nownership is developed. The community-as-contractor approach further instills ownership and transparency and \nprovides opportunities for income generation in areas of high underemployment. \n \nSince the financial crisis, funds for infrastructure development have been limited and there is a backlog of unmet \ndemand for upgrading existing village infrastructure. The approach builds on a history of successful community \nempowerment and development projects where funds are channeled directly to communities for their planning and \nimplementation.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?  x  Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?  X   Yes                   No \n \nD.

Both perspectives are \nimportant to the choice and siting of the investment, planning and implementing construction, and agreeing on \narrangements for use and maintenance. A minimum of 20% of the organizers will be women. This is commensurate \nwith participation of women in the labor force. The village representative committees will include at least one woman, \nand committee membership will be at least 20% female. Experience from the CLGS program shows the number of \nwomen on the committees tends to vary from few women to entirely women, depending on circumstances of individual \nvillages. Although it is difficult to measure participation of men and women in construction, some tasks tend to be done \nmore by women, such as finishing work on masonry and concrete, ground clearing preparations, spreading gravel, \nleveling and filling work, and other tasks requiring attention to detail and manual dexterity.

The financial management assessment was carried out in the context that the Project is \nfinancing  a  geographic  slice  of  the  Government\u2019s  own  larger  Fuel  Subsidy  Reduction \nCompensation Program (PKPS-BBM). Due diligence focused on (i) the institutional framework \nin  which  the  project  is  to  be  implemented,  and  in  particular  on  assessing  the  financial \nmanagement capacity and readiness of the implementing agency; (ii) the adequacy of the \nimplementation arrangements that would ensure the ADB funds would be utilized effectively for \nthe intended purpose; and (iii) identifying additional levels of controls or procedures that could \nbe introduced for mitigating against any obvious weaknesses.  \n \nK.  Assessment of the Executing Agency  \n2.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW)  through  its  Directorate  General  of  Human \nSettlements (DGHS) is the Executing Agency for the Project. The Ministry is experienced in \nexecuting community-driven infrastructure projects, and it is currently handling the PKPS-BBM \nproject. The Project will incorporate specific actions to ensure implementation of measures \nagreed between the MPW (then the Ministry of Settlements and Regional Infrastructure) and the \nADB on 11 June 2004, which are aimed at increasing efficiency, enhancing quality of project \noutputs, and preventing fraud and corruption. The action plan is in Appendix 7, and its features \nappropriate to the Project design will be incorporated into the loan agreement.  \n \n3.  Notwithstanding past experience and approval of the budget by the Parliament in June \n2005, the Ministry has launched a comprehensive socialization of the program and has taken \nsteps to ensure effective preparedness with respect to the implementing structures, processes, \nand guidelines. Given the lead-time required for these activities, the PKPS-BBM, which was \napproved by the Parliament in June 2005, started disbursing funds to the village level only in \nSeptember 2005. Even prior to the approval by the Parliament, the Government, as part of its \nplanning and design phase, had undertaken a series of steps to ensure that once the budget \nwas approved the funds could flow quickly. Some of the steps undertaken were as follow: \n(i)  The MPW received funds amounting to Rp3.3 trillion for the PKPS-BBM for rural \nroad rehabilitation, clean water facility, and irrigation. These focus areas were not \nnew to the Ministry, as it had been focusing on them since 2001. \n(ii)  Up to mid-March 2005, the MPW established coordinating teams and launched \nsocialization activities for the provinces and the districts.  \n(iii)  The MPW produced comprehensive but easy to understand manuals delineating \nprocedures ranging from the technical to the fiduciary aspects of the PKPS-BBM \nsupport. These manual have been disseminated. The manuals with respect to \nthe fiduciary controls have been reviewed and found to be adequate in meeting \nthe  needs  of  the  Project  implementation.  The  Government  is  open  to \namendments, if necessary. \n(iv)  From mid-March 2005 until mid-April 2005, the focus was on the socialization on \nthe Kecamatan (subdistrict) level. \n(v)  During  April  2005,  PKPS-BBM  facilitators  were  recruited  and  trained  on  the \nvarious PKPS-BBM implementing issues.  \n(vi)  From March to mid-May 2005, the MPW conducted a selection process on the \ndistricts, including their profile and criteria for eligibility. In parallel, during May \n2005, the selected district proposed a list of villages, types of infrastructure to be \ndeveloped, and a training program for the technical facilitators.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 6  39 \n(vii)  In the villages, the process of selecting the plan and setting up the organizing \ncommittee was started. \n(viii)  From June onwards, the focus was on ensuring that the funds flow to the village \nwould be fast and the funds utilization would be smooth and follow procedures \ndesigned to mitigate corruption risk. \n(ix)  To be prudent, the MPW initially released first tranche funds to 2,500 villages to \ndevelop some experience and to iron out any obvious wrinkles in the process. An \ninitial review has shown that the first tranche disbursement to these villages went \nsmoothly, as has the utilization of the funds, and the Government is about to \ndisburse the second tranche. \n \nL.  Assessment of the Implementing arrangements \n4.  The fiduciary assessment of the implementing arrangements for the PKPS-BBM focused \non  critical  steps  in  the  implementation  process  to  determine  whether  the  arrangements \nincorporated were based on what had proven successful in practice in previous and ongoing \nprograms that are similar, as well as on whether improved controls had been incorporated to \nmilitate against recognized weaknesses. It also looked to identify what additional controls could \nbe implemented by the ADB program either to militate against the weaknesses or to strengthen \nwhat had been incorporated in the PKPS-BBM arrangements.  \n \n5.  Implicit in the above is the recognition that village administration is the most transparent \nand democratic in the country and the realization that there are many self-governing checks and \nbalances  at  the  village  level  to  militate  against  corruption.  With  respect  to  effective \nanticorruption measures, it is recognized that, as the project is a poverty reduction exercise, the \nmain thrust of the anticorruption agenda is to ensure that the beneficiaries directly receive the \nfunds  with  minimum  delay  and  that  no  leakages  occur  at  the  village  level.  Effective \nanticorruption measures need to focus on three broad principles: (i) elimination of hierarchy and \ncomplexity; (ii) transparency at all levels, and particularly at the transaction level, and (iii) an \neffective complaints mechanism.  \n \n6.  The assessment benchmarked the following critical steps: \n \n(i)  Planning. So that the village-level assessments are prepared in a transparent, \nconsistent, and cost-effective manner, with the villagers clearly aware of how \nmuch they were getting and for what. \n(ii)  Disbursement  and  funds  flow  to  the  village.  So  that  the  funds  flow \nmechanisms to the village are smooth and transparent. \n(iii)  Utilization  at  the  village  level. So that the utilization at the village level is \nadequately controlled with regular, transparent record keeping and recording. \n(iv)  Monitoring and evaluation. So that the monitoring and evaluation allows for an \nindependent assessment of the village investment outputs compared to the plan \nand overall program objectives. \n \n1.  Planning \n7.  The villages are pre-selected based on predetermined poverty criteria that utilize data \nfrom the Central Statistics Agency. This is intended to provide objectivity in how the villages are \nchosen, reduce delays in selecting the villages, and allow some direct targeting of poor villages. \nThis moves away from the competitive selection of villages as was used under the earlier \n ", "40  Appendix 6 \nKecamatan Development Project (KDP), thus eliminating the bureaucratic layer required for this \nstep in the process. \n \n8.  Villagers\u2019 investment decisions are taken at the village community level. Village plans \nwill be very much driven by local community imperatives and will be quarantined from influence \nby district or provincial authorities. Even traditional village-level hierarchies are bypassed, as the \nvillage head is encouraged not to be part of the design or implementation teams, but rather to \ntake a quality assurance and external monitoring role. The planning procedures force the village \nplans to delineate clearly all aspect of the village investment costs in a predetermined format. In \nparticular,  where  local  villagers  themselves  will  be  employed  the  plan  must  indicate  the \nindividuals, the rates to be paid, and the length of time the individuals will be employed. Every \nvillage-level plan must be countersigned by the village team, an independent member of the \nvillage, and the village organizer prior to submitting the plan for funds release. The villages \ndecide where to spend the money from an existing menu of options provided by the project \nguidelines.  As  mentioned  above,  these  guidelines  have  already  been  socialized  and \ndisseminated. The role of the district-level project manager is mainly to ensure that a plan has \nbeen produced and implemented according to the guidelines. \n \n9.  Simplified procurement practices focus on the community level. It is noted that a large \nportion of the funds are allocated for block grants to the villages. Communities are not only \nallowed to plan the programs, but they must also implement them. It is up to the community to \nconclude as to whether the activities can be carried out by the community itself or whether it \nneeds to be contracted out to external consultants. In that way, the community will take into \nconsideration issues such as lack of technology, manpower, or equipment. Villagers will be \nallowed to procure goods and services based on local economic factors and need not be \ninfluenced by Government pricing procedures or the urban market economy. To further ensure \nthat it will impact on poverty alleviation, the Project will be focused mainly on reconstruction and \nrehabilitation  in  specific  areas  rather  than  on  new  infrastructure  construction.  This  will \nsignificantly reduce the need for external contractors. Employment generation is encouraged, as \nit is recognized that villagers themselves will undertake many of these activities using their own \nlabor. The Project allows for a greater degree of additional technical support in the earlier \nstages for project design and supervision. \n \n2.  Disbursement and Funds Flow \n10.  Disbursement per Village. The project allows for a fixed amount per village that is \nstandardized and widely publicized so that all stakeholders know how much the village will be \ngetting. As mentioned above, funds are disbursed upon completion of an approved plan that is \nformulated by a village. Disbursements will be in tranches, with each tranche representing a \nfixed  percentage  of  the  total  allocated  per  village.  Tranche  release  conditions  have  been \npublicized  in  a  clear  regulation  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (Treasury  regulation  No. \n02/PB/2005). They are clearly delineated in the procedures, socialized, standardized, and not \nonerous. The releases to the village are as follow: \n \n(i)  First  tranche.  Representing  40%  of  the  fixed  amount.  Released  following \nsubmission of the village\u2019s physical and funds utilization plan. \n(ii)  Second tranche. Representing 40% of the fixed amount. Released when the \nimplementation progress, in terms of value, has reached a minimum of 36% \ncompletion. This is based on a progress report approved by the village and \nreviewed  by  the  district.  This  report  would  include  detailed  supporting \n ", "  Appendix 6  41 \ndocumentation and reports on the funds utilization\u2014including any revisions to the \noriginal plans. \n(iii)  Third tranche. Representing the final 20% of the fixed amount. Released if the \nprogress has reached a minimum of 72% completion, as agreed by the district-\nlevel project implementation unit, plus with the provision of additional information \nas for the second tranche.  \n \n11.  Funds Flow to the Village. Project-specific project funds will be created at the central \nlevel to receive project funds. For the Project there will be a project-specific special account \nopened in the Bank Indonesia to receive funds from ADB. Approved withdrawals from the latter \nwill be the basis of replenishment from ADB. Once plans are approved, funds will flow directly \nfrom the special account to the village bank accounts, i.e., there will be no intermediary account \nbetween the special account and the village bank account. This will minimize any rent-seeking \nfor the release of project funds that can happen if funds are transferred through a hierarchy. The \noverall schematic of the funds flow is delineated in Appendix 14. \n \n3.  Utilization at the Village Level \n12.  Funds Withdrawal from the Village Bank Account. The village cannot withdraw funds \nwithout  countersigning  by  two  pre-appointed  individuals  whose  names  have  already  been \nsubmitted to the local bank. The openings of the bank accounts have been simplified. \n \n13.  Record Keeping and Transparency of Reports. Every item of expenditure has to be \naccounted for on detailed but simple expense reports. Training is provided to ensure sufficient \nsupporting documentation is maintained for the audit. The Project has incorporated many of the \nfeatures of the World Bank\u2019s KDP project with regard to the transparency of records and reports \nat the village level. The Project will undertake a media campaign in the selected villages, \nsubdistricts, and districts to ensure adequate awareness of project approach and interventions. \nAt the village level, the communities will make available their plans, budgets, and financial \nrecords to the public. A summary of the plans, progress reports, and financial records will also \nbe posted on signboards within the village. The Project will also enable flow of information to \ncommunities  by  requiring  the  districts  and  subdistricts  to  provide  copies  of  the  quarterly \nprogress  reports  to  the  communities.  This  will  help  in  cross-checking  the  accuracy  and \ncompleteness of reports. At the Project level, the Government and ADB will disclose the Project-\nrelated information in accordance with ADB\u2019s public communication policy.1 \n \n4.  Monitoring and Evaluation  \n14.  Overall  Program  Monitoring  of  PKPS-BBM.  The  Government  has  set  up  a \ncoordinating  team  consisting  of  the  ministries  of  public  works,  finance,  agriculture,  and \nmanpower, as well as other related institutions. The team will coordinate task forces at a \nregional level. The Government has clearly stated that, given that a large bulk of the monitoring \nfunds will go directly to the regional governments, it would impose strict sanctions if the funds \ndid not reach their targets. The Government has encouraged nongovernment organizations and \nother external parties to comment on any stage of the program implementation.  \n \n15.  Extensive Use of Facilitators. Facilitators are provided at the districts, subdistricts, and \nvillages to assist in technical planning and implementation. In addition, these facilitators will \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. The Public Communications Policy of the Asian Development Bank.

Audits.  There  will  be  extensive  use  of  internal  auditors  as  part  of  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  At  the  village  level,  the  target  is  to  have  80%  of  villages  audited  by  the \nGovernment\u2019s internal auditors. In that respect, the executing agency has incorporated the \nrecommendations of the ADB technical assistance that produced a Ministry of Settlements and \nRegional  Infrastructure  action  plan.  That  plan  encourages  use  of  the  inspector  general  in \nmonitoring and evaluating projects. In addition, external audits of the overall PKPS-BBM by the \nsupreme  audit  institution  will  be  undertaken.  The  Project  itself  has  allocated  funds  to \nsupplement the existing audit by the supreme auditor institution that will allow for spot audits \nwhere necessary for specific concerns. \n \n17.  Effective Complaints Mechanism. In the implementing guidelines for the PKPS-BBM, \npublic  complaints  mechanisms  are  detailed  at  length.  Public  complaints  are  part  of  the \nsupervision  encouraged  by  the  public,  including  nongovernment  organizations,  community \ngroups, religious groups, universities, and journalists. \n \n18.  Complaints may be made through (i) the public complaints unit; (ii) a post box provided \nby the village representative committee; (iii) a letter directly to the village head, public forum, \nand the village working group; and (iv) a letter directly to the related government units from \nsubdistrict level up to the central level of Government. \n \n19.  Complaints  will  be  divided  into  the  categories  (i)  deviation  from  the  principles  and \nprocedures, (ii) deviation from approved funds usage, (iii) interventions that harm the project, (iv) \nforce majeur events, and (v) other matters. Complaints will be resolved transparently and by \nprinciples of participation. In this regard, public participation will be encouraged and supported \nby the facilitator. Complaints will be monitored and reported in the monthly report and will be \nfollowed by further investigation, if required. \n \nC.   Additional Monitoring and Evaluation Provided within the Project \n \n20.  The Project provides for 8% of project funds to be utilized for activities other than the \nblock  grants.  This  is  double  the  current  4%  being  proposed  by  the  Government  for  the \nPKPS-BBM. In terms of specific activities, the Project recognizes that the Government has \ndrawn on best practices from ongoing and past programs and hence the focus of the additional \nfunds is to provide a greater degree and depth of the existing monitoring and evaluation rather \nthan to suggest additional monitoring and evaluation steps. There is obviously a need to avoid \nexcessive regulation but also to have effective regulation. The infrastructure rehabilitation and \nimprovement plan is more likely to err on the conservative side, as it allows for this greater \ndegree of scrutiny at each level. Hence, there will be more technical facilitators and financial \nmanagement facilitators at the local level, along with spot audits.  \n \n21.  More importantly, the Government has agreed to an evaluation of the Government \nPKPS-BBM early in 2006 so that deficiencies and weaknesses can be addressed. The Project \nwill conduct an in-depth analysis of the financial procedures and processes, taking into account \nthe actual experiences of the PKPK-BBM exercise. If additional levels of control are required, \nthen the Government has agreed to accept that as part of the Project. In addition, it would \nconsider implementing the recommendations in the next tranche release of the Government\u2019s \nown funds.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 6  43 \nD.  Conclusions \n \n22.  The PKPS-BBM was found to be well designed, ably administered, and with sound \nfinancial  management  systems  and  fiduciary  controls.  The  Mission  incorporated  additional \nfeatures and mechanisms into the Project design, where deemed necessary. The Government \nagreed to undertake further assessments to ascertain the development effectiveness of the \nPKPS-BBM and the adequacy of its financial management systems at the completion of 2005 \nactivities. Lessons learned will be incorporated into the design of the PKPS-BBM and of the \nProject. \n \n ", "44  Appendix 7 \nFIDUCIARY CONTROL, FRAUD, AND ANTICORRUPTION ACTION PLAN \n \nNo  Issue  Action  Responsibility/  Status/ \nFunding  Remarks \n \n1.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Project is unlikely to have adverse environmental impact and has been rated in \ncategory C. No environmental impact analysis or initial environmental examination is required, \nbut evaluating environmental implications of the specific schemes under the Project will be \nrequired. The infrastructure schemes to be supported by the Project will be selected during \nimplementation.  This  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  will  be  used  for \nscreening  the  schemes  so  that  those  selected  meet  category  C  requirements  and  the \nGovernment\u2019s  similar  environmental  management  requirements.  If  screening  identifies  any \nschemes requiring any additional environmental procedural requirements under ADB or the \nGovernment\u2019s laws and policies, then those schemes will not be selected under the Project. \n \nB.  Overview of the Likely Schemes to be Assessed \n \n2.  The  Project  will  support  the  rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  small-scale  village \ninfrastructure  through  a  community-driven  development  approach,  using  a  block  grant  of \n$25,000 equivalent to each village. The infrastructure may include village roads, bridges and \nculverts, village irrigation schemes, water supply and sanitation schemes, and drainage works. \nThe activities will be undertaken by communities, largely through manual labor and using locally \navailable materials. The activities will be small and in general will lead to improvements in \npeople\u2019s welfare, sustainable use of resources, and improved hygiene. These will result in \nenvironmental improvements. Given the small size of the interventions and provision of close \ntechnical and social facilitation to communities, potential negative environmental impacts will be \nminimal  and  can  be  readily  mitigated.  Nonetheless,  schemes  will  be  screened  through  a \nframework with appropriate checklists to ensure that there are no negative impacts. \n \nC.  Country\u2019s Environmental Assessment and Review Procedure \n \n4.  Indonesia  has  its  own  environmental  impact  management  system  for  development \nprojects, Analisis Mangenai Dampak Lingkungan Hidup, which specifies procedural steps and \nrequired mitigation measures. According to that system\u2019s criteria, the overall Project does not \nrequire environmental assessment, but each individual scheme would need to be screened. \n \nD.  Environmental Screening Process and Implementation Arrangements \n \n5.  Before they are approved for project financing, all schemes will be reviewed by the \nproject  implementation  unit  at  district  level  for  their  feasibility,  technical  soundness,  and \ncompliance with environmental guidelines. Based on the screening processes (Supplementary \nAppendix C), those schemes will be selected that are deemed to have minimal environmental \nimpact and demonstrate \u201cequivalence\u201d between ADB\u2019s and the Government\u2019s environmental \nrequirements.  The  Project  provides  for  24  person-months  of  environmental  safeguard \nspecialists. The consultants will train the provincial, district, and subdistrict staff in screening for \nenvironmental impacts and will undertake spot-checks on a sample of schemes to verify the \nthoroughness and accuracy of the screening process. The Project staff and consultants will \nfacilitate the village implementation organizations to evaluate the proposed schemes and their \ndesigns  using  the  checklists,  existing  government  guidelines,  and  the  screening  criteria \nindicated  above.  Based  on  this  evaluation,  any  schemes  that  would  not  meet  the \naforementioned screening criteria will not be included in the Project. These evaluations will be \ncrosschecked by district-level officials for adherence to the stated criteria. \n ", "48  Appendix 9 \nSUMMARY OF PROJECT COSTS \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchangea  Currency  Cost \nA.

The Project will support rural infrastructure rehabilitation and improvement, providing about \n1,800 villages with financial resources and technical backstopping for small interventions, including \nvillage roads, bridges and culverts, village irrigation schemes, water supply and sanitation. As \nvillage  investments  will  follow  a  community-based  approach,  designs  and  costs  of  selected \ninterventions will be determined during implementation. Quantifiable benefits will arise from village \nrural investments as increased rural incomes and welfare, but, because beneficiaries determine \ninvestments, the Project\u2019s actual inputs and outputs cannot be predicted up front. The Project, \ntherefore, does not lend itself to a traditional economic analysis. \n \nB.  Likely Benefits and Impacts of Rural Infrastructure \n2.  Rural Infrastructure Benefits. The more common benefits expected to accrue include (i) \ntime  savings  in  collecting  water  and  cost  savings  in  obtaining  water;  (ii)  emergence  of  new \nbusinesses due to access to a water supply; (iii) time and cost savings due to faster transportation, \nincluding  more  efficient  transportation  of  goods  to  market;  (iv)  increase  in  the  value  of  land \nadjacent to a new road; (v) new employment in the transport sector; (vi) increase in the value of \nagricultural land serviced by new irrigation works; (vii) increase in incomes due to better harvests \nresulting from reliable water supply; (viii) savings from potential damage to buildings and crops due \nto reduced flooding and improved irrigation, and (ix) creation of new businesses (roads). \n \n3.  Employment  Generation.  The  Government  of  Indonesia\u2019s  Fuel  Subsidy  Reduction \nCompensation Program (PKPS-BBM) currently under implementation estimates that 30% to 50% \nof the total civil works inputs will consist of labor. Using a conservative estimate of 30% of village \ngrant  utilization,  the  Project  is  anticipated  to  generate  an  average  of  100  person/months  of \nemployment per village, or about a total 180,000 person/months. With an average labor wage of $3 \nper day, the short-term employment income generated by the Project is anticipated to be about \n$14 million. \n \n4.  Poverty Reduction Impact. Infrastructure investments can also have a significant impact \non poverty reduction, although their abilities to reduce poverty varies. This is greater where poverty \nis most widespread and with better poverty targeting of projects.36 A number of case studies and \nevaluations have confirmed that infrastructure development reduces rural poverty through many \nchannels, such as improved growth in agricultural production, greater rural nonfarm employment, \nand  migration.  Nevertheless,  there  may  be  time  lags  between  the  investment  in  improved \ninfrastructure and the positive impacts.37 Evidence from studies has shown that rural transport \nimprovements, in particular, and which are usually the types of intervention most demanded by the \ncommunities, do (i) contribute to decreasing the costs to the poor for personal travel and goods \ntransport; (ii) increase the range of opportunities for wage employment (thereby raising the price of \nlabor in rural areas); and (iii) increase empowerment of the poor and their participation in local \norganizations,  activities  outside  the  rural  community,  and  local  political  processes  and \nmanagement structures.38  \n \n                                                 \n36 Cook, C. 2004.

In addition to the direct and indirect yields from the rural infrastructure \ninvestments,  the  Project  is  expected  to  provide  benefits  through  the  technical  assistance  to \ncommunities and districts in designing and implementing infrastructure works, as well as the \ntraining of government staff. These, however, are Project activities for which input costs are \nidentifiable but benefits and outputs cannot be predicted with accuracy. \n \nC.  Evidence from Two Post-Evaluation Studies \n6.  The existence and significance of the economic benefits of rural infrastructure investments \nthat are expected to derive from the Project, overall and by type of intervention, are confirmed by \nextensive  experience  in  Indonesia.  In  particular,  the  conclusions  of  two  very  recent  ex-post \nevaluations\u2014one of an Asian Development  Bank (ADB) and one of two World Bank funded \nprojects\u2014verified  very  significant  benefits  from  similar  community-based  interventions.39 The \nbenefits were observed in terms of economic returns, cost effectiveness, quality of life, and income \nmultipliers. The results of these evaluations are particularly relevant to the interventions planned \nunder the Project, due to similarities in the approach to service delivery, types of infrastructure \nlikely to be involved, and grant sizes. \n \n1.  ADB  Community  and  Local  Government  Support  Sector  Development \nProgram \n7.  Economic  and  Poverty  Reduction  Impact.  The  2005  independent  evaluation  of  the \nGovernment  of  Indonesia  and  ADB\u2019s  Community  and  Local  Government  Support  Sector \nDevelopment Program did not undertake a quantitative analysis of the impact of that project.40 \nHowever, the qualitative evaluation confirmed that rural infrastructure investments had a positive \nimpact on poverty reduction, stimulated village economic activities, and represented an important \nsource of primary and secondary employment that generated additional disposable income for the \nvillagers. The positive impact and benefits were greater in the cases of those interventions decided \nupon and implemented at the village level and by the communities themselves as compared to \ninterventions where district authorities were responsible for the use of the funds.  \n \n8.  Employment Generation. Overall, a total of 11,341,000 person-days of employment were \ngenerated for a total of 378,000 participants. On average, this meant that over the course of the \nproject a total of 37 person/months of employment for 31 individuals were created in each of the \nparticipating villages.  \n \n9.  Quality  of  Life. The study noted  a high level of satisfaction among the communities \nreceiving  rural  infrastructure  interventions  and  enthusiastic  support  from  the  participants. \nSatisfaction  and  achievement  of  project  objectives  were  greater  in  the  cases  of  investments \nimplemented in a village-driven approach. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n39 ADB.

World Bank\u2019s Kecamatan Development Projects (KDP) \n \n10.  The PKPS-BBM and the Project design and approaches are largely patterned on the \ninfrastructure development support under the KDP, and hence there are large similarities between \nthe two. Both the KDP and PKPS-BBM follow a community-driven development approach that \nemploys  social  facilitation  to  empower  the  communities  to  prioritize,  plan,  and  propose  the \ninfrastructure development to meet their priority needs. Both the KDP and PKPS-BBM allow for \nmultiple infrastructure schemes in individual villages, with an average of about two schemes per \nvillage. Based on the approved plans, block grants are transferred directly to the community \norganizations\u2019  bank  accounts.  These  funds  cover  construction  costs  related  to  materials, \nequipment, and labor. Unlike the PKPS-BBM, the grant size in the KDP is not fixed. However, the \nfindings from evaluating the KDP phases I and II indicate that average grant size of about $24,000 \nper  village  is  similar  to  the  grant  size  under  the  PKPS-BBM.  In  addition  to  the  types  of \ninfrastructure eligible under the PKPS-BBM, the KDP also allows for health- and education-related \ninfrastructure. Grant utilization for these additional purposes, however, has been less than 2% of \nthe total. The construction activities under both the PKPS-BBM and KDP follow a community-led \napproach where the use of local labor, materials, and equipment is encouraged. \n \n11.  The  findings  from  the  KDP  implementation  show  that  project  has  been  successful. \nInvestments in rural infrastructure development have been economically and financially viable and \nsustainable. Given that the PKPS-BBM follows a similar community-led implementation approach, \nsupports similar types and size of infrastructure, and invests similar amounts, the returns from the \nPKPS-BBM are anticipated to be similar in size and nature. \n \n12.  Economic Benefits. Commissioned in 2005 by the Government of Indonesia and World \nBank, an independent post-construction analysis of 113 rural infrastructure subprojects funded \nunder the KDP confirmed significant economic benefits accruing to villages that planned and built \ninfrastructure  facilities  following  a  community-based  approach. 41  The  average  cost  net  of \ncommunity contribution for these subprojects was about $12,000. Given that under the KDP each \nvillage typically received support for two infrastructure subprojects, the average support for each \nvillage amounted to $24,000, which is similar to the grant size under the proposed Project. In this \ncase, too, the villages have the option for undertaking works on more than one unit of infrastructure.  \n \n13.  The  study  calculated  the  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRR)  for  four  types  of \ninfrastructures: (i) roads, (ii) bridges, (iii) water supply, and (iv) irrigation. The four types were \nchosen because they have been shown over time to be the dominant types of infrastructures \nrequested by the villages (representing more than two thirds of the total investments). The overall \nweighted-average EIRR for all 113 projects was 51.4%. Table A15.1 shows how average EIRRs \nfor each type of infrastructure ranged in the various project provinces: \n \nTable A15.1: Economic Internal Rates of Return \n \n  Type of Infrastructure  Number of   Range of Average EIRR in the \n \nProjects  Various Project Provinces (%) \n \nWater Supply    41  28.4\u201336.4 \n \n  Roads/Bridges    55  33.3\u201347.4 \n  Irrigation    17  66.3\u201385.1 \n  Total     113  51.4 \n \nSource: Economic Impact Analysis of Kecamatan Development Program Infrastructure Project. \n                                                 \n41 Torrens, Anthony. 2005.

The field survey carried out by the study concluded that of the 113 projects \nreviewed, 95% (108) were valued by the villagers as having a \u201cstrongly felt\u201d or \u201cfelt\u201d impact on the \nquality of life of the supported villages. This shows a high level of direct and indirect benefits \naccruing from the investments. \n \n15.  Cost-Effectiveness.  The  cost-effectiveness  analysis  carried  out  by  the  same  study \nreported that village infrastructure built through a community-based approach cost on average 56% \nless than equivalent works built through Ministry of Public Works or local government contracts, \ndemonstrating significant cost savings and additional economic value. The technical quality and \nproject  management  of  94%  of  the  113  projects  reviewed  was  evaluated  by  the  villagers \ninterviewed as very good or good. \n \n16.  Employment Generation. The total workdays generated from all the KDP infrastructure \nprojects totaled 37 million for a total of 28,000 villages. Thus, on average, employment of 53 \nperson/months was created in each of the participating villages over the course of the project.  \n \n17.  General Income Multiplier. A general income multiplier analysis was also undertaken. \nThis  estimated  the  disposable  incomes  and  spending  patterns  of  key  groups  within  the \ncommunities to assess the impact of the funds spent by the projects as they circulated within the \nvillage economies. The study for the Government of Indonesia and World Bank shows that the \ncash injected by the 113 projects into the village economies generated significant additional value, \nwith an average multiplier for the 113 projects of 1.165.
