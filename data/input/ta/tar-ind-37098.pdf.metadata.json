Mundle and S. Chakravarti. \n ", "I.  INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Country Strategy and Program (CSP) \nMission in January 2003, the Government of India, acting on the recommendation of the Task \nForce  on  Direct  and  Indirect  Taxes  (2002),  requested  assistance  to  modernize  the \nadministration of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) and the Central Board of Excise and \nCustoms (CBEC). An advisory technical assistance (TA) to strengthen the capacity of India\u2019s tax \nadministration was accordingly included in India\u2019s CSP for the period 2003\u20132006. The goals, \noutputs, activities, implementation, and financing arrangements of the TA are laid out in this \nreport. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  A high fiscal deficit continues to be a major challenge for economic management in \nIndia. The combined fiscal deficit of the central and state governments has remained over 9% of \nthe gross domestic product (GDP) since 1998\u20131999. Despite significant rationalization and \nsimplification of the direct and indirect tax structures over the 1990s, the overall tax-GDP ratio \nhas actually fallen from 15.4% in 1990\u20131991 to around 14.4% in 2001\u20132002. Tax policy reforms \ncan be effective only if they are accompanied by appropriate measures to strengthen tax \nadministration. It is therefore, crucial to strengthen tax administration to keep pace with tax \npolicy reforms, expand the tax base, and move to a system of voluntary compliance. This will \nimprove the fiscal situation of the central Government and the state governments, which are \nhighly dependent on the devolution of central taxes. In strengthening tax administration, the TA \nwill help in fiscal consolidation which is a core objective under the governance component of the \nCSP, and establish a sound macroeconomic environment for absorbing a growing investment \nprogram financed by ADB and others. \n \n3.  Reforming tax administration in a federal country the size of India is a challenge. Since \n1991, the Government, CBDT, and CBEC have undertaken many reform initiatives based on \nthe recommendations of various expert groups.2 ADB\u2019s past assistance in the area of tax policy \nand administration include the Improvement of State Sales Tax Structure and Administration \n(1995), Capacity Building of Income Tax Administration (1996), Capacity Building at the Post-\nImplementation Stage for VAT Reform (2002), and several other TAs and loans linked to public \nresource management in ADB\u2019s focal states.3 Other bilateral and multilateral agencies such as \nthe Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), United States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID), and World Bank have also supported the tax reforms of the central and \nstate governments. CIDA\u2019s project, Capacity Development of Revenue Administration, which \nbegan in 1997\u20131998 and ends in early 2004, is the longest running externally funded initiative to \nstrengthen tax administration in India. CBDT and CBEC have made significant progress in \nseveral areas under this project. CIDA however, will not be able to renew its project beyond \nMarch 2004 due to the Government\u2019s recent decision to discontinue direct assistance from \nsmall bilateral sources. Accordingly, this TA will build on the tax administration reforms initiated \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) on 21 July 2003. \n2  These include the Tax Reform Committee headed by R.J. Chelliah, 1993; Advisory Group on Tax Policy and Tax \nAdministration for the Tenth Plan headed by P. Shome, 1998; Expert Group on Service Tax headed by M. Govinda \nRao (1999); and most recently, the Task Force on Direct and Indirect Taxes headed by V. L. Kelkar (2002). \n3  As the CSP notes, \u201cIn the past, ADB assistance for fiscal management mainly focused on the states. However, fiscal \nconsolidation at the Center is equally important. ADB assistance for the Center should be targeted at low-cost, high-\nreturn interventions, and should primarily focus on TA for the revenue and expenditure departments in the Ministry of \nFinance for capacity building in line with best international practices.\u201d ", "2  \nby CBDT and CBEC with CIDA\u2019s assistance. The TA will also help the two Boards with the other \ncritical initiatives they are currently undertaking. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n4.  The overall goal of the TA is to help CBDT and CBEC strive toward the objectives set \nout in their Citizens\u2019 Charters and Vision Documents to be fair, judicious, transparent, efficient, \nand courteous. Its purpose is to strengthen functional capacity in CBDT and CBEC for a \nvoluntary compliance\u2013oriented tax administration by improving risk assessment (RA) based \naudit capacity and the quality of taxpayer services. The TA will assist in expanding the tax base \nby strengthening service tax administration and audit. To achieve these goals, tax officers will \nbe trained in various tax reform initiatives and in the use of computerized work platforms. The \ncapacity of the National Academy of Customs, Excise, and Narcotics (NACEN) and the National \nAcademy of Direct Taxes (NADT) to provide quality training will be strengthened based on \nupdated training manuals, audiovisual aids, and distance learning programs.  \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n5.  The TA will work toward its goal by focusing on the activities listed here and in the TA \nframework (Appendix 1). \n \n1.  Strengthen Audit Capacity Through Risk Assessment \n \n6.  A  comprehensive  and  reliable  audit  system  can  help  encourage  voluntary  tax \ncompliance. Building such a system is one of the challenges facing CBDT and CBEC today.  \n \n7.  In  the  field  of  indirect  taxes,  CBEC  has  been  undertaking  business  process  re-\nengineering (BPR) projects together with large-scale computerization over the past few years. \nOne of the areas it seeks to strengthen is RA-based audit capacity. Since reliable physical audit \nof a large number of units is not feasible, computer-based RA is essential for selecting high-risk \nunits for audit.4 With CIDA\u2019s assistance, CBEC has already prepared an Excise Audit manual, \nand is in the process of setting up a computer\u2013assisted audit program (CAAP). The TA will help \nCBEC in continuing with the excise BPR initiative by strengthening the electronic filing of excise \nreturns and other assessee-related information, and analysis of this data using RA. It will help \ndevelop appropriate risk parameters and the software necessary for undertaking RA.  \n \n8.  As part of its BPR project, the Customs Department has also been trying to do away with \npre-clearance scrutiny of import and export declarations and physical examination of goods, and \nto set up a post-clearance audit system for exporters and importers. Its aim is to move from \ndiscretionary to rules-based decision making, lower transaction costs, and facilitate trade and \nbusiness. The TA will help the Customs Department to implement this BPR initiative.  \n \n9.  In the field of direct taxes too, CBDT is moving away from a system of discretion-based \nselection of returns to scientific RA-based audit selection. The TA will support this initiative. \n                                                 \n4  More than 70,000 manufacturing units contribute about $16 billion in excise duties annually. Around 4,000 of these \nare large units that pay more than $220,000 each. Together, these units account for about 86% of total excise \nrevenue. There is mandatory audit of these large units. The remaining 66,000 small and medium units are audited \nperiodically as per norms determined by the Board. ", "  3\nThere is an urgent need to expand the direct tax base since it has remained stagnant at 3% of \nGDP since 1995\u20131996. A computerized audit selection system will bring more clients into the \ntax net and encourage voluntary compliance. \n \n2.  Expand the Tax Base by Strengthening Service Tax Administration and \nAudit \n \n10.  The services sector is the largest sector in the economy with its share in GDP (around \n50%) exceeding that of agriculture (23%) and industry (27%). It has also been growing faster \nthan the other two sectors.5 However, this sector is largely untaxed and was brought under the \ntax net only in 1994\u20131995. There is tremendous potential to expand the tax base by tapping \nservices effectively and by bringing more services under the tax net over time. Further, since the \nFinance Act of 2001 has introduced self-assessment for service tax returns, building RA-based \naudit capacity is very important to ensure voluntary compliance. \n \n11.  CBEC has prepared a Service Tax Audit manual under the CIDA Project. The TA will \nhelp  CBEC  to  adapt  and  operationalize  this  manual  in  the  context  of  recent  policy \nannouncements such as increase in the coverage of services under the tax net. It will suitably \nreplicate  the  excise  BPR  initiatives  to  strengthen  service  tax  administration.  Appropriate  \nsoftware will be developed for building up assessee profiles and carrying out RA.  \n \n3.  Build Capacity of NACEN and NADT and Train Officers \n \n12.  The TA will provide for two broad types of training for officers of CBDT and CBEC. First, \na core group of about 15 officers who are working on these capacity building activities will be \ngiven hands-on exposure to international best practices through a field trip abroad, e.g. to the \nCanadian Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA), for about 3 weeks. These officers will in turn \ntrain more trainers back in India. They will also work with NACEN and NADT to design training \ncourses for the new business processes with the help of consultants. Second, the TA will help \nupgrade the overall training facilities of NACEN and NADT. Some assistance to upgrade the \ntraining facilities of the regional centers of NACEN, NADT, and selected Commissionerates will \nalso be provided.6 It is essential to train as many officers as possible in BPR and other reform \ninitiatives.  Their  computer  skills  have  to  be  upgraded.  Officers  will  be  trained  in  using \ncomputerized RA programs and in conducting audits in a non-adversarial manner. Innovative \naudiovisual training courses, manuals, and distance learning packages will be developed to \nexpand the reach of the training programs. Officers need to own the tax reforms. They should \nnot see themselves as enforcers of punitive tax provisions, but as facilitators of voluntary \ncompliance.  \n \n4.  Improve and Expand Taxpayer Services \n \n13.  Compliance  with  tax  laws  is  the  shared  responsibility  of  the  taxpayer  and  the  tax \ncollector. The TA will help CBDT and CBEC develop the quality of their taxpayer services \nfurther. Taxpayers will be educated about their rights and obligations. They will be kept informed \nabout  the  reforms  and  simplified  procedures  through  various  means  such  as  newsletters, \npamphlets, interactive voice response system, CBDT and CBEC\u2019s web sites, and tax clinics. \n                                                 \n5  Between 1995\u20131996 and 2001\u20132002, the services sector grew at more than 8% on average per annum, whereas \nagriculture grew at around 2.5% and industry at around 6%. \n6  NACEN and NADT train tax officers of many Asian countries. By upgrading their training facilities to international \nstandards as regional centers of excellence, ADB will promote regional cooperation on issues of international tax \ncooperation such as control of money laundering, narco-terrorism, and smuggling of arms. ", "4  \nEffective grievance redressal mechanisms will be set up to reduce the number of litigations and \ndisputes, and to strengthen the faith of taxpayers in the tax system. Programs for groups with \nspecial  needs  will  be  designed.  Taxpayers  must  be  assured  that  CBDT  and  CBEC  are \nundertaking reforms to make compliance easier. However, purposeful evaders will be dealt with \nstrictly. Well-designed taxpayer services can be very effective in complementing the RA-based \naudit initiatives in lowering evasion and expanding the tax base. A taxpayer perception survey \nwill  be  conducted  to  assess  the  awareness  and  views  of  taxpayers  regarding  the  reform \ninitiatives of CBDT and CBEC. Through the right mix of RA-based audit reforms, training, \ntaxpayer education, and enforcement, the TA should help make tax compliance the norm, and \nevasion the exception. \n \n5.  Organize Conferences and Workshops  \n \n14.  Two international conferences will be organized in New Delhi under the TA. The first will \nbe held in March\u2013April 2004. It will assess against international benchmarks, the progress made \nin  tax  administration  reforms  to  date,  their  impact  on  revenue,  and  the  lessons  learned. \nRepresentatives of chambers of commerce, different service providers, industries, small and \nmedium-scale enterprises, and tax experts will be invited to provide feedback. International \nexperts  will  also  be  invited  to  share  international  best  practice  and  experience  in  tax \nadministration. Such a conference will help to disseminate information on the reform initiatives \nof CBDT and CBEC to the public. It will also generate valuable feedback that will help in \neffectively implementing the TA. A similar conference will be held towards the end of the TA to \ntake stock of its achievements and the lessons learned. Additional workshops may also be \norganized as required. \n \nC.   Cost and Financing  \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,250,000 equivalent of which $691,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $559,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The entire foreign \nexchange cost, and $309,000 equivalent of the local currency cost will be financed from two \nsources. Grants of $500,000 each will be provided from ADB\u2019s TA funding program and the \nGovernment  of  the  United  Kingdom.  CBDT  and  CBEC  will  meet  the  local  currency  cost \nequivalent of $250,000 in kind as the imputed value of staff time, office accommodation and \nsupplies, local transportation, and cost of internal workshops. Detailed cost estimates and the \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  CBDT and CBEC will be the two executing agencies (EAs) for the TA. The two Boards \nwill each appoint a TA coordinator who will oversee the overall implementation of the TA \nactivities  pertaining  to  them.  The  activities  will  be  carried  out  through  three  implementing \nagencies (IAs) for CBEC \u2013 the offices of the Director General (Systems), DG (Audit), and \nNACEN \u2013 and the following IAs for CBDT \u2013 DG (Systems), DG (Audit), and NADT. Since the \nactivities cut across IAs, interagency working groups (WGs) will be constituted as required for \nimplementation. There will be a TA steering committee chaired by the Revenue Secretary, and \ncomprising the Chairmen of CBDT and CBEC, the ADB project officer, and other members as \nnominated by the Government. The committee will review the progress of activities listed in the \nTA framework and make adjustments as required. Appendix 3 gives a schematic representation \nof the TA\u2019s implementation arrangements.  \n ", "  5\n17.  USAID is considering a complementary TA under which Indian tax officials will be trained \nin the United States in applying RA techniques and in designing effective taxpayer services. \nThis project is being developed in close coordination with the ADB TA, which provides for \ntraining of CBDT and CBEC officers on tax audit and taxpayer services in Canada. Exposure to \ntwo of the most advanced tax systems of the world will give CBDT and CBEC officers the \nopportunity to make optimal choices to suit Indian conditions from a menu of international best \npractice.7 \n \n18.  The Government and ADB have agreed that to implement the TA effectively, all officers \nundertaking foreign missions for training will be directly responsible for the relevant functions \ne.g., audit and RA, BPR, training, and distance learning in their current postings. The concerned \nEA and IA will retain the officers in their current postings until their respective TA activities are \ncompleted. The Government will provide the required facilities to the WG members to pursue \nthe  TA  activities.  Given  the  urgent  need  to  strengthen  RA\u2013based  audit  capacity,  the \nGovernment will provide the necessary infrastructure, staff, and resources to the office of the \nDirector General (Audit). The TA is expected to start in March 2004 and will be implemented \nover a period of 18 months, ending in September 2005.  \n \n19.  A team of international and domestic consultants will be engaged for 24 person-months \nand 46 person-months respectively, to help in implementing the TA. The consultants will be \nselected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The \ninternational consultants will be individual consultants, and will include RA-based audit experts \nfor excise and service tax, customs, and direct taxes; and experts in tax administration, training \n(with experience of developing distance learning programs), and taxpayer services. Since the \nterms of reference (TOR) of international consultants require highly specialized skills, all the \nrelevant experts will not be available in-house in a single firm, reducing flexibility in selecting the \nbest  team.  Also,  a  firm\u2019s  own  margins  will  significantly  increase  costs  of  hiring  the  same \nconsultants  who  could  be  recruited  individually.  Therefore,  individual  consultants  will  be \nengaged for cost-effective and efficient implementation of the TA within the available budget. \nHowever, domestic consultants will be recruited through a firm which will be better suited to \ncoordinate  the  TA  activities,  assist  in  software  design  and  development,  and  strengthen \ntaxpayer services. The biodata technical proposal and quality\u2013and cost\u2013based selection will be \nused to select the consultants. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \nSome necessary equipment will be procured in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.8 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom, and (ii) ADB providing the \nbalance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of India \nfor Capacity Building for Tax Administration, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n                                                 \n7  The USAID project is being planned for $250,000. Savings in travel costs through back-to-back missions to North \nAmerica under the ADB and USAID projects will be used to train more officers under the ADB TA.  \n8  Details of the equipment procured will be determined during implementation of the TA. It will consist mainly of some \ncomputers, audiovisual equipment, and related accessories.
