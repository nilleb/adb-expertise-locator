INTRODUCTION \n1.  Environmentally sustainable development is one of the four core programs of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132016 for Thailand.1 This capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) was included in the ADB country operations business \nplan for Thailand, 2016\u20132018.2 During the 2016 country programming mission, the Government \nof Thailand confirmed the request for technical support to strengthen the country\u2019s integrated \nwater resources planning and management at the river basin level. The government is finalizing \nthe 12th National Economic and Social Development Plan, 2017\u20132021;3 and water resources \nmanagement remains high on Thailand\u2019s development agenda under the plan. The TA impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost estimates and financing agreements, and \nterms of reference were agreed during a TA fact-finding mission from 6 to 15 July 2016. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4  \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  2011  severe  floods  affected  almost  14  million  people  in  65  of  Thailand\u2019s  77 \nprovinces. The Ministry of Finance estimated the total economic damage and loss caused by \nthe floods at approximately $45 billion. One important lesson learned from the 2011 floods was \nthat integrated water resources management (IWRM) needed to be strengthened as flood \nmanagement is closely linked with broader issues of water resources management. Without an \nintegrated and balanced approach to manage both demand and supply of water, Thailand will \nnot be prepared for future flooding. \n \n3.  The IWRM principles were first recognized in Thailand\u2019s 8th National Economic and \nSocial Development Plan, 1997\u20132001.5 In IWRM, the basin is recognized as a natural and \npractical hydrological unit for water resources planning and management. Using the basin as a \nplanning unit allows for holistic basin solutions to be developed to address problems in the basin, \nincluding upstream\u2013downstream controversies. A strong integrated water resources planning \nand management process at the river basin level is not only important to the entire water \nresources  management  system,  but  it  is  also  essential  in  improving  the  livelihoods  and \neconomic well-being of communities along the river basins. In Thailand, however, river basin \norganizations  were  not  legal  entities  and  their  roles  in  conjunction  with  central  water \nmanagement agencies were not well-defined. Planning and implementation capacity of river \nbasin organizations are also lacking. As a result, water resources planning and management \nhave been rather centralized.  \n \n4.  The National Water Resource Management Strategic Plan, 2015\u201320266 approved by \nCabinet in May 2015, recognizing the importance of IWRM at river basin level, clearly defines \nroles and responsibilities of river basin committees and calls for the development of operation \nplans at the river basins. A river basin committee comprises representatives from the Ministry of \nInterior,  local  government  units,  communities,  the  private  sector,  and  academia,  with \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013.

However, the \nplanning capacity, as well as participatory mechanism, is still lacking at the river basin level. \nStakeholder  engagement  and  involvement  processes  need  to  be  strengthened  to  ensure \nmeaningful consultations during all phases of river basin planning and development.  Modeling \napplications  to  assess  individual  and  cumulative  impacts  should  be  introduced  to  support \ndecision-making process.  \n \n5.  To facilitate decision-making among stakeholders in the river basin planning process, \nthe IWRM modeling tool was pilot tested for Yom River basin and Mae Ta sub-basin under the \nTechnical  Assistance  for  Strengthening  Integrated  Water  and  Flood  Management \nImplementation funded by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR).7 The modeling tool \nprovided a technical and scientific basis for integrated social, economic, and environmental \nassessments of water management scenarios in the basin. As an open-source model, trained \npersonnel can update and manipulate the modeling tool to understand the impact of changing \nmanagement  scenario.  Graphic  displays  demonstrated  through  the  modeling  tool  helped \nstakeholders at Mae Ta sub-basin of Yom River basin to better understand flood, drought, and \nwater allocation issues in the basin. Such demonstration of the possible impacts of different \nwater management scenarios helped the stakeholders reach agreement on how to manage the \nsub-basin to minimize the risk of future floods and improve the livelihoods of Mae Ta sub-basin \ncommunities.   \n \n6.  The DWR requested technical support to create a base IWRM modeling tool based on \nthe approach demonstrated at Yom River basin. The base IWRM modeling tool can be used as \nthe basis to develop planning scenarios and river basin operation plans in all 25 river basins in \nThailand. Using the IWRM modeling tool as a decision-support tool will enhance the capacity of \nDWR officers\u2014along with members of river basin committees\u2014to develop spatially driven and \nintegrated river basin management plans. The deployment of quality and effective river basin \noperation plans will improve the livelihoods of communities along river basins in the medium to \nlong term. These communities will be able to make informed decisions regarding water resource \nuse and develop coping strategies to deal with flood, drought, and weather-related extreme \nevents.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be improved overall efficiency of the water management system. The \noutcome will be integrated river basin management strengthened in 25 river basins.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  Output 1: Base river basin integrated water resource management modeling tool \nestablished. The IWRM modeling tool is a computer-based hydrological model that enables \nusers to test the hydrological impact of different water resources management approaches in a \nriver basin. The IWRM model pilot tested under the Technical Assistance for Strengthening \nIntegrated Water and Flood Management Implementation will be further developed as a base \nIWRM simulation tool at the river basin level. A user-friendly results interpretation module will be \n                                                \n7 ADB.  2012.

This module will help enhance understanding among stakeholders \nof the possible impacts of development options and climate change on the flow regime, and \nenable community-based stakeholders to negotiate satisfactory trade-offs and find optimal ways \nto achieve objectives. The TA will also support the development of the cumulative impacts \nassessment feature of the modeling tool to facilitate water resource management decision- \nmaking at the national-wide level. A user-friendly manual on how to carry out the simulation and \ninterpret results will be developed.   \n  \n9.  Output 2: Capacity of river basin personnel in river basin integrated planning \nincreased.  As vital links in community-based multi-stakeholder involvement, DWR personnel at \nthe provincial level, covering 25 river basins, will be trained to collate and coordinate hydro-\nmeteorological data and carry out simulations to assess alternative strategies.  With these \ntrained personnel, the DWR will use the simulation tool to roll out community-based, multi-\nstakeholder participation programs at river basins nationwide. The training will also involve how \nto demonstrate and communicate simulation results to stakeholders, and guide discussion on \noptions for river basin management to achieve consensus on rational solutions.  In addition, the \nTA will propose guidelines for a decision-making procedure, based on stakeholder participation \nfor the development of water management solutions within river basins and cross-river basins. \n \n10.  To calibrate IWRM model for each river basin, geographic information system (GIS) data \nshould  be  available  in  the  appropriate  resolution.  Modifying  GIS  data  to  an  appropriate \nresolution takes time, but the executing agency is of the view that river basin staff can complete \nthe simulation after the TA is closed if they are trained to follow the standard user manual. The \nriver basin operation plans may take longer than envisaged to achieve the outcomes if the \ngovernment does not provide the river basin committees with the necessary resources. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction.  The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff, land transportation at river \nbasins for the TA team, office space and supplies, training venues and equipment (in Bangkok \nand at river basins), necessary GIS and hydrological data, and other in-kind contributions.  \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The TA will be implemented from October 2016 to June 2018. The DWR, Ministry of \nNatural Resources and Environment will be the executing agency. The DWR will set up a \nworking group to work closely with the TA project team. The director general of the DWR will \nprovide direction and guidance to the working group and the TA project team. ADB\u2019s Southeast \nAsia Department will be responsible for administration of the TA through its Thailand Resident \nMission.   \n  \n13.   ADB will engage a consulting firm using fixed-budget selection with a biodata technical \nproposal, and a national water resources advisor as an individual consultant. About 14 person-\nmonths of international and 27 person-months of national consulting inputs are estimated to be \nrequired. Consulting services to be engaged through a firm will include (i) three international \nconsultants:  (a)  an  IWRM  expert  (4 person-months),  (b)  a  modeling  specialist  (5  person-\nmonths), and (c) a GIS specialist (5 person-months); and (ii) three national consultants: (a) a \nhydrological modeler (5 person-months), (b) a hydrological researcher (8 person-months), and \n(c)  a  project  coordinator  (10 person-months).  A  national  water  resources  advisor  will  be \n ", "4   \nengaged as an individual consultant for 4 person-months. ADB will engage the consultants in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nThe TA team will conduct at least five training workshops for the executing agency and relevant \nstakeholders. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time) in compliance with \nthe 2016 Policy Guidelines for TA Grant.8 \n \n14.  The DWR, as the secretariat for the National Water Resources Committee and all river \nbasin committees, will be responsible for the completion of the river basin operation plans. \nBased on the outputs of the proposed TA, the DWR will guide the discussion on options for river \nbasin management to achieve consensus on rational solutions, and work with each river basin \ncommittee to complete river basin operation plans. The DWR will maintain access to updated \nGIS and hydrological data, and use the base IWRM modeling tool to guide the review and \nupdate of river basin operation plans.      \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment  of  Thailand  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction for Strengthening Integrated Water Resource Planning and Management at River \nBasin Level, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n                                                \n8 ADB. 2016.
