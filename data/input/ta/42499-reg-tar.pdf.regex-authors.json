The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has joined a recently formed partnership with the \nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development,  New  Zealand  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment, and World Bank Group to create a Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility (PRIF) for \ncoordination and finance of technical assistance (TA) and investments.1 The PRIF partners are \neach contributing financial resources (through country and regional programs) and technical \nexpertise. The Government of Australia will provide about $80 million in new grant resources \nover the first 4 years, while ADB and the World Bank Group have each identified pipeline \nprojects and TA that would be suitable for cofinancing through the PRIF. This multi-partner \nmechanism is a significant new and joint commitment to improving infrastructure services in the \nregion in accordance with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.  \n \n2.  The PRIF will contribute directly to the three strategic objectives of the Pacific strategy.2 \nTwo  of  these  objectives  include  key  results  areas  related  to  infrastructure  provision: \n(i) enhancing  the  supply  of  quality  basic  social  services  through  increased  resources  and \ncapacity to deliver; and (ii) supporting a conducive environment for the private sector through \nimproved provision, operation, maintenance, and regulation of infrastructure. The third strategic \nobjective  of  promoting  effective  development  processes  specifies  enhanced  development \npartner coordination and harmonization as a key result area. \n \n3.  In the initial stage, the PRIF will be open to all Pacific island countries (PICs) that are \nmembers  of  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum\u2014except  Papua  New  Guinea,  which  is  receiving \nextensive infrastructure funding through different mechanisms; and the Fiji Islands, pending \napproval of reengagement by all PRIF partners.3 \n \n4.  The PRIF partners operate through a senior management team and an infrastructure \nworking group (IWG), both of which meet regularly to plan and reach consensus on strategic \ndirections, practical initiatives, and business processes to guide PRIF operations. To date, this \nwork has resulted in (i) the development of a design and peer review process for PRIF advisory \nand investment support, (ii) joint hosting of an inaugural regional workshop to engage with and \ninvolve key government stakeholders,4 (iii) prioritization of a pipeline of activities for the first year, \nand (iv) design of an interim mechanism for provision of TA support. A key outcome of the \nregional consultations was confirmation from all of the PIC partners that the establishment of a \nmechanism to support the provision of TA is an immediate priority. 5 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Much  of  the  independent  analytical  work  undertaken  in  recent  years  has  identified \ninstitutional weaknesses as constraining infrastructure development in the Pacific, as much if \nnot more than lack of resources for capital investment. In particular, limited capacity (both \n                                                 \n1  The initiative was officially launched in August 2008 at the Pacific Islands Forum in Niue. \n2  ADB. 2004. Responding to the Priorities of the Poor: A Pacific Strategy for the Asian Development Bank 2005\u2013\n2009. Manila. \n3  This means the PRIF will include countries that are not members of particular PRIF partner agencies (e.g., Niue is \nnot an ADB member, and Tuvalu is not a World Bank member) and will exclude certain member countries of PRIF \npartner agencies, where they are not members of the Pacific Islands Forum (e.g., Timor Leste). \n4  The PRIF partners jointly hosted a 2-day regional workshop in Brisbane on 12\u201313 November 2008, aimed at \nenabling Pacific island government stakeholders to engage with and contribute to the design process for the PRIF. \nTwelve countries attended, including both finance and infrastructure sector decision makers. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 December 2008.  \n ", "2 \ntechnical and managerial) is commonly identified as the greatest constraint. Following extensive \nanalysis of the infrastructure issues confronting PICs, ADB\u2019s Pacific Plan has called for regional \ncapacity  sharing  to  boost  access  to  technical  expertise,  the  development  of  common \napproaches  to  regulation,  and  the  establishment  of  an  accountable  and  independent  TA \nmechanism for the region.6 Likewise, a joint study of infrastructure in the Pacific suggests that \nregional cooperation can assist in overcoming common regional challenges.7  \n \n6.  Most recently, ADB regional TA worked with utility managers, government planners, \nregulators,  private  sector  representatives  and  other  key  stakeholders  in  Pacific  countries \nidentified a core set of key issues.8 These included (i) inappropriate institutional structures to \nsustain quality service delivery; (ii) lack of regulatory capacity to protect the public interest and \nenable a commercial environment; (iii) clear needs for reliable and affordable training; and (iv) \nlack  of  expertise  at  critical  stages  of  sector  reform  (such  as  legislative  drafting,  policy \nformulation, financial and tariff modelling, and engineering inputs). \n \n7.  These findings are both consistent and significant, providing insight into the frequent \nfailure of past infrastructure investments to improve socioeconomic prospects or make a lasting \ndifference  to  development  prospects.  Lack  of  maintenance,  inappropriate  technology, \nunaffordable solutions, and distorted priorities are common concerns. Development partners \nhave often been part of the problem rather than the solution by imposing external priorities, \noverburdening fragile administrative and management systems, and operating competitively in \ntheir own interests rather than collaboratively in the country\u2019s interest. \n \n8.  The PRIF offers PIC governments a new approach to supporting improvements in a \nbroad range of basic infrastructure services including transport, water, sanitation, solid waste \nmanagement, energy, and communications. It will assist with development and maintenance of \ninfrastructure,  and  will  support  both  rural  and  urban  areas.  Dedicated  TA  is  required  to \nsupplement and eventually develop capacity in PICs to participate in the initiative. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  On behalf of the PRIF partners, ADB will establish and manage a Pacific Infrastructure \nAdvisory Center (PIAC) to analyze, plan, and implement PRIF-funded interventions. The PIAC \nis an interim mechanism pending the design and full mobilization of the PRIF itself, although it is \nexpected that the PIAC will be absorbed within the broader PRIF. In general terms, the PIAC \nseeks  to  contribute  to  improved  policy,  design,  regulation,  financing,  management,  and \nmaintenance of infrastructure; and to encourage private sector participation in PRIF partner \ncountries. Its specific objective during the interim phase is to provide PICs with immediate \naccess to TA support for the key infrastructure sectors. \n \n10.  The PIAC will (i) be capable of supporting a range of small to medium-sized proposals \nfrom identification to implementation; (ii) allow the PRIF to analyze and promote solutions that \nimprove the efficiency and effectiveness of infrastructure and service delivery, and promote \nincreased private sector participation in PICs; and (iii) offer the potential for cross-country \nsharing of practical lessons and expertise as well as information.  \n \n                                                 \n6   Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. 2005.

The expected impact will be to assist PICs to plan and implement appropriate and \nsustainable infrastructure and services that support achievement of national development goals. \nThe outcome will be high-quality strategies, policies, regulations, and project designs that are \nsuitable for future coordinated and harmonized assistance by PRIF partner agencies and other \nstakeholders through loans, grants, and private sector participation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  Ready  access  to  TA  during  the  PRIF\u2019s  design  phase  offers  a  flexible  delivery \nmechanism with capacity for genuine responsiveness, incremental implementation to match \ncountry readiness, and opportunities to develop and enhance local ownership. Establishment of \nthe PIAC will establish the credibility of the PRIF as a new way of doing business. \n \n13.  Key outputs will be clustered in five main categories:  \n(i)  analytical studies including institutional assessments of government agencies \nand state-owned enterprises, public expenditure reviews, sector planning and \nbudgeting, and regulatory diagnostics; \n(ii)  policy advice for improvement of infrastructure sector frameworks, in support of \nimplementation of the PRIF, including strategies, investment plans, and budgets;  \n(iii)  short-term rapid response TA including guidance on benchmarking, improvement \nof  asset  management  practices,  and  assistance  in  improving  procurement \npractices; \n(iv)  preparation of TA and investment proposals; and  \n(v)  coordination and harmonization of external assistance provided by PRIF partners \nand relevant regional organizations. \n \n14.  The PRIF expects to support a broad range of TA and capacity development activities \nover the longer term. However, during the interim phase, the scope of PIAC support will be \nmodest. The focus will be on the following key functions:  \n(i)  commencing engagement and communication with countries;  \n(ii)  fielding requests and referring them through the IWG to the appropriate partner \nagency;  \n(iii)  providing on-call technical expertise, including a help-desk role; \n(iv)  developing a network of the various PRIF partner resources; and  \n(v)  preparing rolling 6-month work programs for each country that can be supported \nby staff and technical specialists contracted or assigned to the PIAC.  \n \n15.  The PIAC will employ a process of progressive engagement, wherein initial support for \nsmall-scale TA may be followed by larger or more intensive stages of TA, subject to successful \noutcomes of earlier stages and continuing high-level support. Priority will be given to supporting \ninstitutions that have documented their strategic development directions. When such strategies \nare incomplete, the PIAC will assist in documenting these as a precursor to other assistance. \nProvision of support will be demand-driven and rigorously assessed against the agreed PRIF \nprinciples. \n \n16.  The  PIAC  will  identify  and  encourage  linkages  between  stakeholders  with  common \ninterests  that  enable  proper  integration  of  infrastructure  plans  and  proposals  with  national \nbudgets, based on clear local leadership and commitment to effective processes and sector \n ", "4 \nperformance. The PIAC\u2019s primary target partners will be key government agencies in the PICs, \nincluding but not restricted to central coordinating agencies, infrastructure ministries, and state-\nowned enterprises. It will also seek to liaise proactively with nonpublic stakeholders such as \nutility associations, the private sector, academia, and regional organizations where they are \nengaged in infrastructure-related activities that will enhance development opportunities and \nstrengthen  development  effectiveness.  This  model  is  based  on  lessons  from  previous  TA \nexperience  within  the  region  and  internationally,  modified  to  reflect  PIC  demands  and \ncapacities.9 \n \n17.  Proposals developed by the PIAC for TA and projects are expected to be financed \nthrough the PRIF and cofinanced by PRIF partners and other stakeholders through grants, \nloans, private sector investment, and government resources. Establishment of the PIAC will \nassist in delivering the lending and nonlending pipelines of all PRIF partners in Pacific island \ncountries, and increase their coordination. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2,400,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis in the amount of $1,800,000 by the Government of Australia to be administered by ADB. \nParticipating governments will contribute $600,000 through in-kind counterpart contributions of \ncounterpart  staff  salaries,  office  accommodation,  local  transport,  support  services,  and \nfacilitation of consultations. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The TA will be implemented by ADB. The PIAC office will be established in the Pacific \nLiaison and Coordination Office. The TA will have a term of 18 months and will be implemented \nfrom January 2009 to June 2010. \n \n20.  The IWG will serve as the project coordinating committee and will be responsible for \noverall guidance, approval of criteria for activity selection and prioritization, monitoring, and \nreporting. The IWG will be supported by a secretariat to be established by the PRIF partners \nthat will establish process management and coordination mechanisms. IWG approval of design \nand  implementation  arrangements  will  be  required  for  TA  subprojects  exceeding  $75,000. \nParticipating  PIC  governments,  the  private  sector,  and  other  development  partners  will  be \nconsulted as appropriate.  \n \n21.  The initial PIAC work program, for the first 6 months of implementation, will be jointly \nprepared by the IWG. Future work programs will be prepared by PIAC staff for approval by the \nIWG. The PIAC will submit quarterly progress reports to the IWG, covering (i) issues of concern \nor potential concern; (ii) progress in relation to strategic priorities, including relationship building; \n(iii) progress of individual TA activities; (iv) management issues (budgeting, expenditure, staffing, \netc.);  (v)  progress  toward  specified  outcomes;  and  (vi)  recommendations  for  action  or  for \nredirection of priorities. Regular joint reviews by PRIF partner agencies will be carried out. PIAC \ninformation,  reports,  and  other  relevant  documentation  will  normally  be  published  on  a \ndedicated website.10 \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2006.

Implementation of TA activities will require consulting services. In consultations with the \nIWG, ADB will recruit a core team of two international consultants (up to 36 person-months) and \ntwo  national  consultants  (up  to  36  person-months)  to  support  the  initial  identification, \nprocurement, and mobilization of TA. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3.  \n \n23.  Specialized short-term TA will also be required for specific assignments that result from \ngovernment  demand  for  analysis,  advice,  and  project  preparation  in  the  expected  focal \nsubsectors (transport, water, sanitation, solid waste management, energy, and communications). \nADB will recruit additional international consultants (up to 18 person-months) and national \nconsultants (up to 18 person-months). Terms of reference for short-term assignments will be \nprepared by the PIAC core team and submitted for approval by the IWG.  \n \n24.  The consultants will be recruited on an individual basis as (i) the two professional-level \nspecialists will fill complex and sensitive roles that require direct control over selection, (ii) there \nare only two professional level staff to be recruited on a full-time basis, (iii) it is not cost-effective \nto recruit administrative staff through a firm, and (iv) it is unlikely that any firm would have the \nrange of expertise to provide the required international and national short-term specialists in \nhighly specialized areas. Consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Disbursements will be made in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, as amended from \ntime to time). Equipment and materials financed under the TA will be procured by the PIAC core \nteam in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n25.  The PIAC manager position is particularly critical, both for management of the PIAC and \nfor providing proactive advice on optimal approaches for advancing PRIF priorities (through TA \nor otherwise), as they are identified. The PIAC manager will be the initial point of contact for \npartner  countries  in  accessing  the  PIAC  and  identifying  TA  needs.  The  position  will  be \naccountable to the PRIF senior management team through the IWG, and will be responsible for \nthe quality, relevance, and coherence of the work provided through PIAC. The manager will also \nmanage the activities and outputs of specialists that are provided directly by PRIF partners. The \nrole will involve balancing the interests of governments, other stakeholders, and PRIF partners.  \n \n26.  The PIAC deputy manager will provide key support to the manager in the day-to-day \nrunning of the PIAC, including supervision of other core staff and technical consultants. The \ndeputy manager will provide an essential link between the strategic direction of the PIAC and \nthe  details  of  administration.  The  position  requires  specialist  expertise  in  one  of  the  focal \nsubsectors, complementing those of the manager, as well as a range of generic skills.  \n \n27.  The PIAC will initially require two administrative staff to provide support functions for the \nPIAC. Priority skills include high-level secretarial expertise (including in complex coordination; \nliaison including with senior officials; preparation of minutes, correspondence, and other written \nmaterials;  and  technological  proficiency  in  preparation  and  formatting  of  documents, \nspreadsheets, diagrams, and databases); budget management; and office management. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n28.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,800,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of Australia for the Establishment of the Pacific Infrastructure Advisory Center. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance  Data Sources and/or   \nDesign  Targets and/or  Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nPICs will plan and  Demonstrated  Government strategies  Commitment by PIC \nimplement appropriate  improvements in  and plans   governments and PRIF \nand sustainable  integrating and  partners to reform \nPIAC policy and strategy \ninfrastructure and  implementing national  infrastructure planning and \nreviews \nservices that support  and sectoral  implementation \nachievement of national  development plans  Review missions by PRIF   \ndevelopment goals.    partners  Risk \n \n  Limited capacity in PIC \ngovernment agencies to \nimplement recommendations \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nHigh-quality strategies,  Improved sector plans  Government budgets and  PIC agencies and PRIF \npolicies, regulations,  linked to capital and  sector reports  partners apply outputs to \nand project designs  recurrent budgets  improve government \nPIAC sector assessments \nsuitable for future  systems and country and \nStrengthened  and activity reporting \ncoordinated and  sector programs \nregulatory and \nharmonized assistance  Program and project \noperational capacity  PRIF partners devote \nby PRIF partner  reviews by PRIF partners \nresources to guiding and \nagencies and other  More joint missions and   \nsupporting PIAC activities \nstakeholders for loans,  fewer independent \n \ngrants, and private  assessments by PRIF \nRisk \nsector participation.  partners \n    Implementing \nrecommendations could take \nlonger than anticipated \n \nOutputs    Assumptions \n1.
