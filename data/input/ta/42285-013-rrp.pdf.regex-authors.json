THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan; (ii) proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Strategic Climate Fund (SCF);1 and (iii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided \nby  the  ADB  SCF  to  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Integrated  Urban  Environmental \nManagement in the Tonle Sap Basin Project.2 \n2.  The project will contribute to increased economic activities and environmental protection \nin  towns  in  the  Tonle  Sap  Basin.  It  responds  to  the  need  of  municipal  governments  for \nintegrated  urban  environmental  management  in  urban  areas  around Tonle  Sap  Lake. The \nproject  will  improve  urban  services  and  enhance  climate  change  resilience  in  Kampong \nChhnang  and  Pursat  municipalities  through  urban  area  environmental  improvements; \ncommunity mobilization and environmental improvements; strengthened sector coordination and \noperations;  and  strengthened  capacity  for  project  implementation,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M).3 The project follows the Tonle Sap Urban Areas Development Framework \n(TSUADF) and Kampong Chhnang and Pursat urban development strategies to 2030.4 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Urbanization in Cambodia is taking place rapidly since 2004 with an average urban \ngrowth rate of 2.6% per year. In 2013, about 21.4% of Cambodia\u2019s population lived in urban \nareas. Urban areas are crucial to Cambodia\u2019s economic development and its integration into \nregional  markets  such  as  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  and  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN). However, urbanization has been taking place with minimal \ncoordination and regulation, inadequate infrastructure and insufficient regard for environmental \nimpacts. This has resulted in unplanned growth, inefficient land use, damage and loss of natural \nresources, and inadequate access to urban services. Problems are attributable to poor urban \nmanagement, little strategic spatial planning, poor integration of environmental management in \nurban planning, and insufficient investment in infrastructure and community services. Urban \nplanning and investments are needed to accommodate expanding urban populations, sustain \neconomic growth in urban areas, and protect the environment. \n4.  Urban areas in the Tonle Sap Basin have a direct and symbiotic relationship with their \nrural areas, which are based on agriculture, fisheries and manufacturing. About 12% of the \npopulation in the Tonle Sap provinces live in urban areas along Highways No. 5 and 6, which \nencompass the Tonle Sap Lake; the six largest urban areas had an estimated population of \n480,000 in 2012 which is anticipated to grow to 670,000 by 2030.5 The Tonle Sap, a designated \nbiosphere reserve since 1997, contributes about 60% of the country\u2019s total inland fisheries \nproduction. It is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia and covers 250,000\u2013300,000 \nhectares (ha) in the dry season and 1.0 million\u20131.6 million ha in the wet season.  \n                                                \n1   Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) financed by the SCF. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of \nCambodia for Preparing the Integrated Urban Environmental Management in the Tonle Sap Basin Project. Manila. \n(TA 7986-CAM, $700,000, approved on 13 December 2011). \n4  TSUADF is for approval by the government. Kampong Chhnang and Pursat urban development strategies were \napproved on 31 July 2014.  \n5  Includes municipalities of Kampong Chhnang, Pursat, Serei Saophoan, Siem Reap, Stueng Saen and Battambang. \nUrban growth figures are estimates based on national census and National Institute of Statistics projections. \n ", "2 \n5.  The TSUADF guides sustainable growth and climate resilient infrastructure development \nof urban areas in the Tonle Sap Basin. The Tonle Sap is at risk of being adversely affected by \nclimate-induced changes to the Mekong River and its tributaries. About 62% of the Tonle Sap\u2019s \nwater originates in the Mekong River and 38% in the Tonle Sap basin. It absorbs about 20% of \nthe Mekong River\u2019s floodwaters. The Tonle Sap is connected to the Mekong River by the Tonle \nSap River, which reverses its flow seasonally. As a result of climate change impacts, average \nwater levels in the Tonle Sap may rise by 0.2 m and peak water levels may increase by up to \n0.3 m by 2050, so floods may last 9% longer, and the probability of river floods is likely to \nincrease.6 Standard  &  Poor\u2019s  ranked  Cambodia\u2019s  economy  and  creditworthiness  as  most \nvulnerable to the effects of climate change amongst the 116 nations measured as part of a \nvulnerability  index.7 The  TSUADF  prioritizes  Kampong  Chhnang  and  Pursat  municipalities \nbecause of their strategic importance, climate change risk and environment protection needs, \nand synergies with ADB agriculture and rural development projects. Increased prosperity and \ngreater climate  resilient  infrastructure  will  strengthen rural-urban  regional  linkages  in these \ntowns through an integrated approach to urban environmental management.8 \n6.  Kampong Chhnang and Pursat urban development strategies list severe flooding and \npoor environmental sanitation as key infrastructure issues affecting residents\u2019 health and well-\nbeing. Both municipalities experienced severe flooding in 2011 and suffer flooding 6\u20138 months \nof a year. In Kampong Chhnang, the annual hydrological cycle of the Tonle Sap is the main \ncause  of  flooding  and  inundation  damage.9 In  Pursat,  lack  of  drainage  causes  the  most \ninundation  damage  and  affects  80%  of  the  town.  This  is  made  worse  by  climate-induced \nimpacts  and  limited  solid  waste  management  (SWM).  \u2018Reduce,  reuse,  recycle\u2019  for  waste \nmanagement is active in both municipalities through junk shops and waste pickers, but only \nabout 20% of the waste stream in Kampong Chhnang and 30% in Pursat is recycled.  \n7.  During the flooding season, poor and vulnerable communities are cut-off from the town \ncenter, restricting their access to markets and social services. They reside in low-lying areas \nnear  the  Tonle  Sap  with  poor  drainage,  and  have  limited  access  to  SWM  services  and \nsanitation, making human waste disposal an environmental issue especially for communities \nliving on, and adjacent to, the Tonle Sap. About 61% of households in Pursat and 50% in \nKampong Chhnang have access to latrines. The Identification of Poor Households Programme \n(IDPoor) identified 2,133 poor households in Kampong Chhnang and 3,456 poor households in \nPursat project area.10 The project will use this program in supporting community initiatives.  \n8.  Multiple agencies at the central government level are involved in urban development \nand environmental protection: the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT), Ministry of \nEconomy and Finance, Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology, Tonle Sap Authority, \nMinistry of Industry and Handicrafts, and Ministry of Rural Development. The Ministry of Land \nManagement, Urban Planning and Construction is responsible for spatial planning. The Ministry \n                                                \n6  C.T. Hoanh, et al. 2010.

The Ministry of Environment oversees \nclimate  change  adaptation  activities,  pollution  control,  green  growth,  and  environmental \nsafeguard compliance, and SWM of household waste. The project will coordinate frequently with \nthese agencies.  \n9.  The role of provincial and municipal governments in decentralized urban management \nand service delivery is evolving with the gradual assignment of functions from line Ministries to \nsubnational governments under the Law on the Administrative Management of the Capital City, \nProvincial and District Towns (Organic Law 2008). The Ministry of Interior is responsible for \npublic administration and subnational matters and the National Committee for Sub-National \nDemocratic  Development  is  the  inter-ministerial  mechanism  for  promoting  democratic \ndevelopment through decentralization and deconcentration reforms. Provincial departments of \nline  ministries  (through  municipalities)  are  responsible  for  O&M,  private  sector  contract \nmanagement and service delivery. The project will address the larger issue of sustainability by \nestablishing semi-autonomous agencies (urban services units [USUs]) for urban services.  \n10.  Related  policies  and  strategies.  The  project  is  in  line  with  the  government\u2019s \nRectangular  Strategy  Phase  III;  the  National  Strategic  Development  Plan  2014\u20132018;  the \nOrganic Law and Sub-decrees; the Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan 2014\u20132023; the \nNational Adaptation Programme of Action for Climate Change; and the ASEAN Clean Tourism \nCity  Standard  initiative.  It  focuses  on  the  Tonle  Sap  provinces  prioritized  in  2013  for \nprogramming because of higher than national average poverty rates and incidence of female \nilliteracy. The project has synergies with other ADB and development partner projects.11 It is \naligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Cambodia, 2014\u20132018; country operations \nbusiness  plan  for  Cambodia,  2015\u20132017;  and  urban  operational  plan,  2011\u20132020  under \nStrategy 2020; and the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020. The project focuses on achieving \nsustainable and inclusive development by transforming key urban areas into competitive and \ngreen urban centers; thereby strengthening rural-urban subregion connectivity and linkages.12  \n11.  ADB  has  played  a  prominent  role  in  the  urban  sector,  together  with  the  Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement,  and  German \ndevelopment cooperation through Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit \n(GIZ). It assisted the government to launch the Tonle Sap Initiative following development of the \nTonle Sap Basin Strategy in 2005. Lessons have been incorporated from ADB\u2019s experience in \nimplementing urban development projects in Cambodia into the project design. These lessons \ninclude the need for strengthening institutional capacity and skills in project implementation and \nmanagement; implementing resettlement in partnership with the government; facilitating sector \ncoordination and stakeholder consultations; and establishing a special operating agency and \naccount for O&M of decentralized services for improved sustainability.13  \n                                                \n11  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12  ADB. 2014.

The impact will be increased economic activities and environmental protection in towns \nin the Tonle Sap Basin. The outcome will be improved urban services and enhanced climate \nchange resilience in Kampong Chhnang and Pursat municipalities. The project will enhance the \nurban  environment,  improve  public  health,  and  contribute  to  better  quality,  coverage  and \nreliability of services to more than 100,000 residents in the municipalities of Kampong Chhnang \nand Pursat. This will be achieved through an integrated program of physical and non-physical \ninvestments.  The  project  incorporates  climate  resilience  measures  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment, with support from the Pilot Program Climate Resilience (PPCR).14  \nC.  Outputs \n13.  Output 1: Kampong Chhnang urban area environmental improvements include flood \nprotection totaling 15.1 km along Tonle Sap riverbank through improvement of the existing \nembankment and construction of a new embankment where required; construction of a new \ncontrolled landfill site of 10 ha at Phnom Tauch village with increased capacity; provision of \nequipment for solid waste collection; and landfill management, including supervised closing of \ntwo open dumpsites in Kul Kuk village and Trork village. It complements the Japan International \nCooperation Agency\u2019s drainage project in the municipality and GIZ\u2019s support for development of \nan urban master plan. Embankment protection will prevent flooding from the Tonle Sap into \nKampong Chhnang town, reducing its vulnerability to flooding and providing protection to 1 in 50 \nyear high water levels. In the dry season, outlets will accommodate the natural streams flowing \ninto the Tonle Sap, and sluice gates will avoid backflow into the town as the water rises. In the \nwet season, natural retention areas will retain wet season flows. The embankment is imperative \nfor residents to have continued access to social services and economic activities in the town \n(e.g., rice processing mills). Improved flood protection will assist farmers in the eastern part of \nthe municipality to increase agricultural production from two to three crops per year.  \n14.  Output 2: Pursat urban area environmental improvements include construction of about \n9.9 km of primary and secondary drains in the town center with associated road improvements \nand improved wastewater treatment; riverbank erosion protection in select locations along the \nPursat River, including revetment and groins; development of a new controlled landfill site of \nabout 28 ha at Toul Mkak village; provision of equipment for solid waste collection; and landfill \nmanagement, including equipment and supervised closing of two old open dumpsites in Toul \nMkak village and Sras Srang village. It complements ADB\u2019s previous support to the Dhamnak \nChheukrom Irrigation System Rehabilitation (located about 40 km upstream). About 20% of the \ntown\u2019s roads have drains connected to National Highway No. 5. Town drainage will improve the \nstormwater drainage system to accommodate more intensive rainfall. It will support increased \neconomic activities in the town, and facilitate residents\u2019 continued access to social services.  \n15.  Output 3: Community mobilization and environmental improvements aim to address the \nclimate change and environmental needs of the urban poor and vulnerable, including ethnic \nCham and Vietnamese in Kampong Chhnang and Pursat\u2014making the project more inclusive. It \nincludes improved household sanitation for IDPoor 1 and 2 in the current municipality area; \nclimate change and hygiene awareness and action; and community small-scale infrastructure \n                                                                                                                                                       \nIndependent Evaluation Department. 2012.

Output  4:  Strengthened  sector  coordination  and  operations  support  the  MPWT  to \nconvene national urban development task force meetings (twice per year); strengthen climate \nchange regulations, focusing on improved building codes in provincial towns around the Tonle \nSap, including appropriate sanitation; and support the establishment of pilot USUs (or special \noperating agencies) for improved delivery and management of decentralized urban services. If \nsuccessful, USUs will demonstrate a mechanism for the sustainability and delivery of quality \ndecentralized urban services, which could be replicated in other municipalities. Climate change \nfinancing will support the Government in implementing the TSUADF around the Tonle Sap by \ndeveloping a consultation program, and a plan for climate change adaptation in urban areas. It \ncomplements the MPWT parallel climate change initiatives in the transport sector.  \n17.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR26,382,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project, including taxes \nand duties of incremental administration costs (office and travel expenses and equipment) and \nworkshops (ADB loan) and taxes and duties of workshops (ADB SCF grant).15 The ADB loan will \nhave a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as \nset forth in the draft loan agreement. The ADB SCF will provide a grant of $5.0 million and a loan \nfor $5.0 million. The proposed ADB SCF loan will have a 40-year term, including a grace period \nof 10 years, and a service charge of 0.1% per annum on the disbursed and outstanding loan \namount. The interest during implementation of the ADB loan and the service charge of the ADB \nSCF loan will be capitalized as part of the loans. The government will provide counterpart \nfinancing of $5.4 million equivalent to cover its 10% contribution to output village grants, costs for \nland acquisition and resettlement, salary supplements, taxes and duties (through exemption), \nand annual audit of project accounts. Community financing of $0.2 million in cash will cover its \n10% contribution to output village grants. ADB SCF Loan and Grant will be front loaded. \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (PAM).16 Procurement of goods and works will follow ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). Consulting services will follow \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Since the \nproject is financed with ADB-administered cofinancing resources as well as Asian Development \nFund resources, universal procurement will apply to all contract packages financed under the \nproject.17 Additional financing may be considered if the project performs well. The original loan, \nsubsequent additional financing, or other finance will be used to achieve readiness for additional \nfinancing in such areas as design, safeguard requirements, and capacity. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2015\u2013October 2022 \nEstimated completion date  31 October 2022 (loan closing: 30 April 2023) \nManagement \n(i)   Project steering committee  Secretary of State, MPWT (chair); Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning \n                                                \n15 ADB loan and ADB SCF grant will finance taxes and duties on ADB loan-financed and ADB SCF grant-financed \nexpenditures, as it is within reasonable country thresholds, does not represent an excessive share of the project \ninvestment, and is material and relevant to the project\u2019s success; and recurrent costs, local transportation, and \ninsurance to facilitate project implementation. \n16  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 ADB. 2013.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n22.  The technologies selected focus on durability and sustainability in both towns. Urban \narea improvements are prioritized and target areas where there is maximum positive impact on \nlocal communities and the environment. Engineering solutions for infrastructure and equipment \nare appropriate and have been developed based on technical viability and compatibility with \nlocal conditions, particularly local O&M capacity. Climate resilience measures will also help \nreduce  maintenance  costs  and  prolong  the  life  of  the  infrastructure  investment.  Contract \npackages  will  attract  contractors  with  skills  and  experience  to  ensure  the  durability  and \ncontinuity of the proposed infrastructure. Community-driven improvements will respond to local \nplanning  and  prioritization  results.  Household  sanitation  improvements  will  be  based  on \nfunction,  cost,  and  long-term  durability  in  an  urban  setting.  The  plan  for  climate  change \nadaptation  in  urban  areas  and  revised  building  codes  will  strengthen  climate  resilience \nmeasures in this and other projects.18   \n                                                \n18  A sanitary landfill is not feasible in Kampong Chhnang or Pursat owing to high initial and operating costs, low \nvolumes of waste generated, high levels of technical expertise required, and people\u2019s low willingness to pay. \n ", "8 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  The project contributes to the improved economic welfare of project residents. Flood \ncontrol components result in significant benefits in savings from property damages avoided and \nsavings from the agricultural and commercial losses resulting from reduced flooding in both \ntowns. Economic benefits for the SWM components are reduced health risks from poor SWM as \nmeasured through savings in the Disability Adjusted Life Years attributable to poor SWM for \nresidents. Base case results indicate that subprojects are economically viable with an estimated \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) that exceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital of \n12%. Base case EIRRs for flood protection and SWM are 18.22% and 16.64% for Kampong \nChhnang and 16.88% and 14.50% for Pursat. Sensitivity analysis showed that the EIRRs are \nmost vulnerable to changes in anticipated benefits. The financial viability of the project\u2019s only \nrevenue earning component was assessed; the financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) for \nSWM  improvements  are  5.98% for  Kampong Chhnang  and 9.59% for  Pursat. The  FIRRs \nexceed the weighted average cost of capital of 2.33% indicating financial viability. Sensitivity \ntests indicate that the FIRRs would be most susceptible to reductions in revenues. Levy of an \nenvironment sanitation fee will help USUs recover O&M costs and gradual depreciation.19 USUs \nwith a dedicated account will facilitate collection and use of user fees for O&M. Results of the \nfinancial projections indicate that user fees can adequately fund O&M of the controlled landfill, \ngarbage collection, and flood control assets during the first 10 years of operation with minimal \ngovernment subsidies. The user fees are affordable based on a fee affordability analysis.20  \nC.  Governance \n24.  A financial management and a procurement capacity assessment of the executing and \nimplementing  agencies  confirmed  the  adequacy  of  project  implementation  and  financial \nmanagement arrangements. The MPWT has experience in managing externally funded projects \nand has sufficient capacity to undertake international and national competitive bidding for civil \nworks packages. Lessons from ADB projects will guide implementation, financial management, \nand accounting. The assessments indicated limited capacity at the subnational level, so the \nPMU will manage all procurement activities and will involve the subnational level in the process. \nA subaccount will be established in each PIU for operational costs, and a special account solely \nfor depositing revenue collected from the environmental sanitation fee for USUs with strict \nreplenishment measures. Output 5 will support PMU and PIU staff. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the \nMPWT. Specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  The project will have positive social and economic impacts on residents in Kampong \nChhnang and Pursat. They will be able to  access livelihood and commercial opportunities \nthrough an improvement in their living conditions and public health. The project will improve \nphysical accessibility; reduce vulnerability risk; and enhance local ownership and sanitation \nawareness. Measures are included to ensure that project benefits reach the urban poor and \nvulnerable groups, such as the ethnic Cham, Vietnamese and floating communities in Kampong \nChhnang. Safety features, such as sidewalks and solar lamps are incorporated for the river \nembankment in Kampong Chhnang and the drainage in Pursat. The project is effective gender \nmainstreaming and has a gender action plan. NGOs and civil society organization contributed to \nthe project design and will continue during implementation. \n                                                \n19 Environmental sanitation fees include garbage collection fees, drainage, and/or flood control service changes. \n20 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  The safeguard category for involuntary resettlement is B in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). An estimated 78,815.25 m2 of land (56,945.75 m2 [public] \nand 21,869.50 m2 [private]) will be acquired for the project. About 139 affected households (or \n576 affected persons) will incur minor impacts  resulting from the loss of fixed assets and \nsources of incomes or livelihoods. About 25 affected households (108 affected persons) will be \nseverely affected by loss of agricultural land or permanent loss of land use equivalent to 10% or \nmore of their total productive assets. The estimated cost of land acquisition and resettlement is \n$257,393.53, including base costs, allowances, contingencies and administration costs. This will \nbe updated after detailed design and the detailed measurement survey. Administrative costs of \nthe grievance committee for grievance resolution will be borne by the project. A cutoff date in \neach  town  has  been  established  with  stakeholder  consultation  and  participation.  Project \ninformation was shared with affected people during project preparation. Information booklets will \nbe disclosed at commune offices and will be distributed to affected households during the \ndetailed measurement survey. An external monitoring organization will confirm compliance with \nthe resettlement plans and will submit monitoring and post-project evaluation reports.21 \n27.  The indigenous peoples safeguard category is B. Ethnic Cham and Vietnamese were \nidentified and meaningfully consulted in Kampong Chhnang villages. They live alongside the \nKhmer majority and are well integrated the larger community. Design features are included to \nensure the ethnic Cham and Vietnamese are beneficiaries and are meaningfully consulted. The \nKampong Chhnang river embankment in some parts will be constructed parallel to the existing \nalignment to avoid resettlement impacts. Output 3 pre-identifies villages where ethnic Cham and \nVietnamese  are  a  majority  of  beneficiaries.  Elements  of  an  indigenous  peoples  plan  are \nintegrated in the project design in lieu of a stand-alone indigenous peoples plan. \n28.  The environment safeguard category is B. Initial environmental examinations and an \nenvironmental assessment review framework have been prepared. Climate resilience measures \nare integrated into the project. Environmental impacts are related to siting, design, construction, \nand operation; and mitigation measures are part of the environment management plans (EMPs). \nEMPs have been prepared for SWM, embankment protection, drainage, and riverbank erosion \nprotection, and will form part of the bidding and contract documents. Potential adverse impacts \nduring construction are expected to be temporary and will be mitigated through the EMPs. The \nproject includes budget and institutional arrangements for EMP implementation and monitoring. \n29.  Safeguard documents are prepared in consultation with communities and according to \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and government laws. 22 They are approved and posted on \nthe ADB website, and will be updated and disclosed after detailed design and cleared by ADB \nprior to contract awards. A grievance redress mechanism will facilitate resolution of complaints.  \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  The overall risk assessment is medium, and the integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 \nand described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.23  \n                                                \n21  Lessons from previous project implementation have been considered, including the importance of good design, \ngrievance redressal, frequent monitoring and implementation capacity. \n22 Resettlement  Plans,  Initial  Environmental  Examination  Plans,  and  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review \nFramework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n23 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nEconomic activities are adversely affected by natural  Climate change impacts are identified and included in the \ndisasters and lack of climate change impacts.  design of infrastructure investments.  \nMunicipalities are not prepared to collect revenues for  A  special  operating  agency  and  account  will  be \noperation and maintenance of urban infrastructure.  established to collect and manage user fees. \nProject start-up delays increase the number of affected  A project implementation specialist will be recruited to \npeople along the embankment alignment.  assist in accelerating project start-up. \nCivil  society  or  nongovernment  organizations  raise  Civil  society  or  nongovernment  organizations  will  be \nconcerns during project implementation.  partners in project implementation.  \nDhamnak Chheukrom Irrigation System Rehabilitation  A detailed hydrological survey of the Pursat River will be \nworks (upstream) does not lower flood levels of Pursat  conducted after completion of works. \nriver in town center after completion. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n31.  The  government  and  the  MPWT,  Kampong  Chhnang  and  Pursat  PDPWTs  and \nmunicipalities of Kampong Chhnang and Pursat have assured ADB that implementation of the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and loan and grant documents. The government and the MPWT \nhave agreed with ADB on certain covenants and conditions for the project, which are set forth in \nthe loan and grant agreements. A loan disbursement condition stipulating that each USU shall \nadopt an environmental sanitation fee before disbursement or withdrawal is made for SWM civil \nworks contract is included. \nV.
