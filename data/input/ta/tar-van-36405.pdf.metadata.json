During the 2003 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthe Government of Vanuatu requested technical assistance (TA) to help the Ministry of Finance \nand  Economic  Management  (MFEM)  prepare  a  medium-term  strategic  framework  that  will \ncreate the basis for setting priorities of sector development plans, corporate plans, departmental \nbudgets, and project proposals. The TA was included in the 2003 TA Program to Vanuatu under \nthe Country Strategy and Program Update. The Fact-Finding Mission, fielded on 21\u201330 April \n2004,  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  TA\u2019s  purpose,  scope, \nimplementation, financing arrangements, and terms of reference.1\n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Under the Government\u2019s Comprehensive Reform Program (CRP) of 1998, supported by \nADB, fundamental reforms were achieved, particularly in public finance. The old line budgeting \nsystem was reformulated into a program budgeting format as a first step to adopting output-\nbased budgeting. The development budget was integrated with recurrent budget documentation \nand reformulated as the Government Investment Program (GIP), which showed the value and \nsource  of  all  foreign  aid\u2014grants  and  loans.  The  budget  documentation  included  a  clear \nstatement of the Government\u2019s objectives and policies in each key area of social and economic \npolicy. Finally the planning period was extended from one to three years, reflecting the expected \nstream of revenue and expenditure. These changes have resulted in the production of a budget \nthat has become more effective in aligning budget allocations with the Government\u2019s priorities.  \n \n3.  While the reform has been ambitious and rapid, it has highlighted a number of gaps and \ninconsistencies in the policy framework and implementation. Areas that require examination and \nredefining  are  formulation  and  articulation  of  medium-  and  long-term  priorities  of  the \nGovernment through the Prioritized Action Agenda (PAA), and the sequence and resourcing of \ncritical policy interventions to realize the country\u2019s developmental goals. The PAA is a planning \nand  budget  formulation  process  that  aims  to  link  policy,  planning,  and  resources  at  the \nGovernment-wide level. The PAA integrates strategic directions, sector policies, and priorities \nbuilt  on  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  millennium  goals,  CRP  matrix,  business  forum  matrix,  etc., \nformulated through stakeholder consultations. The PAA\u2019s objectives are to (i) identify and rank \nactions in terms of priorities that can help kick-start the economy on a sustainable basis, (ii) \nalign external funding agency assistance with the priorities of the Government, and (iii) promote \npolicy stability via the setting of priorities beyond a 12-month budget cycle and, ideally, across \nelection  cycles.  The  PAA  document2  has  provided  a  lead  in  direction  setting  and  priority \nmapping, but remains too broad and complex; lacks focus in some areas; and is fragmented, \nwithout any project cost estimates. Some sector policies are vaguely defined, resulting in some \nambiguous project definition and/or difficulties in linking project proposals to the Government\u2019s \nnational priorities. The Government has announced in its budget statement that the productive \nsectors3 should help kick-start the economy but lacks the analytical capabilities and institutional \nmechanisms  for  mainstreaming  this  into  the  budget  and  corporate  and  business  planning \nexercises. Thus, a linkage has to be created between the broad strategic directions outlined in \nthe PAA to the annual budget process through the GIP and evaluation of sector development \nplans.  The  GIP  is  the  vehicle  for  (i)  ensuring  that  macroeconomic  sector  strategies  are \ntranslated  into  projects;  (ii)  strengthening  the  Government\u2019s  negotiating  position  with  the \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 7 October 2003. \n2  The Government presented the PAA at the Vanuatu Partners Meeting on 4 September 2003. \n3  Productive sectors limited to tourism, agriculture, trade and investment, and infrastructure services. \n ", "2 \ndevelopment partners; (iii) improving aid coordination and channeling external resources to \npriority areas; (iv) assisting government financial management; and (v) strengthening the project \ncycle by providing a framework within which project preparation, implementation, and monitoring \ncan occur. \n \n4.  External assistance is crucial to meet the Government\u2019s capital development needs. In \n2003, it accounted for 86% of the expenditure development budget. Annual aid commitment, \nincluding grants, totaled Vt381 million ($3.5 million) in 2003. As a major source of development \nfinancing,  external  assistance  should  support  only  prioritized  policies  and  physical \nimplementation of closely monitored and evaluated projects.  \n \n5.  The  GIP  process  has  been  overhauled  and  simplified  over  the  years  but  needs \ncontinuous improvement. The GIP fails to direct resources to policy priorities partly because \nbudgeting is treated as a simple funding rather than policy-based exercise, and partly due to the \nlack of authority and responsibility given to line managers to manage resources. Anecdotal \nevidence indicates that the GIP is a wish list of projects dating back to the 1990s that have \nneither been funded nor reassessed for relevance and consistency with national priorities, but \ninstead have been carried over from year to year. The investment proposals submitted for \ninclusion in the GIP lack in-depth policy analysis, cost-benefit analysis, and project justification. \nThe  lead  time  between  submission  to  approval  of  proposals  takes  longer  than  the  norm \nbecause MFEM\u2019s lack of analytical skills. Communication and information flow between the \nministerial budget committee (MBC), Department of Economic and Sector Planning (DESP), \nand line agencies is weak, partly due to the frequent changes in coalition government and the \nhigh turnover of staff. In the absence of effective leadership and decision-making processes, \npolicymaking and planning are disconnected from each other and from budgeting, and are not \nconnected by resource availability or strategic priorities. This leads to a mismatch between what \nis promised by government policies and commitments and what is affordable. Consequently, a \nstrategic prioritization culture should be established within ministries and line agencies and \nawareness raising about this culture among political leaders. Political commitment, ownership, \nand understanding are central to the integrity of the system and budget discipline. Often, line \nagencies need to be forced to fund new activities or extension to existing activities by internally \nreprioritizing spending rather than adopting the softer approach of requesting additional funding \nfrom  the  budget.  Thus,  the  culture  of  reprioritization  as  an  effective  alternative  to  budget \naugmentation  should  be  continuously  reinforced  and  with  all  the  coalition  members  of \nGovernment. \n \n6.   The aid management and coordination unit in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) is \nresponsible for coordinating and dialoguing with Vanuatu\u2019s development partners for funding \nprograms and updating the GIP. It is not regularly updated, and when it is, it is completed ad \nhoc. The updated GIP is then circulated to all ministries and line agencies, but the response rate \nhas been disappointing, resulting in the clogging of the Government financing system. Tracking, \nmonitoring, and evaluating externally assisted projects is manually done ad hoc. A systematic \nmonitoring system needs to be developed to manage the information effectively, ensure that \ninformation is accurate and relayed on time, and evaluation of policies and programs outcomes \nare fed back to the line agencies and ministries.  \n \n7.  In mid-2003, the aid management and coordination unit was transferred out of MFEM to \nthe MFA. It was a tactical move to align the ministry\u2019s mandate of strengthening communication \nwith  aid  agencies,  but  did  not  address  (i)  improving  communication  and  coordination  with \nsectoral ministries and line agencies, (ii) timeliness of disseminating information about projects \nbeing funded, and (iii) tracking of project implementation status. DESP now focuses only on ", "    3 \neconomic  planning  and  sectoral  policy  responsibilities.  The  capacity  of  DESP  and  aid \nmanagement coordination unit is slowly being addressed through contractual recruitment. The \nprincipal economist is on study leave while an economist and an assistant are managing the \neconomics division in coordination with MFEM\u2019s budget section. Of the six sectoral analysts, \ntwo are full-time employees while four new graduates are on a contractual basis. The aid \nmanagement coordination unit still has no head, and the position is likely to be advertised soon. \nSome observers have said that DESP and aid management coordination unit lack a proactive \napproach in dialoguing and coordinating across sectors with the line agencies and vice versa. \nThis may be explained by the deficiencies in the financial and policy analysis skills of central \nand line agencies due to lack of technical capability, lack of skills and experience of existing \nstaff, and shortage of resources to adequately staff and supply planning departments in line \nministries and central agencies. \n \n8.  The role and linkages of DESP and the aid management coordination unit need to be \nclarified  because  the  two  departments  are  interdependent.  DESP  identifies  high-priority \nprojects,  and  aid  management  coordination  unit  seeks  aid  funding  for  them.  A  further \ncomplication  is  the  different  reporting  requirements  of  most  aid-funded  public  investment \nprograms. DESP only monitors the approvals of investments against the program, but the aid \nmanagement coordination unit needs to monitor implementation and disbursement. Therefore, a \nframework through the PAA can help strengthen the working relationship between the two \nagencies and harmonize coordination of donor priorities and reporting requirements with the \noverall development strategy and opportunities for growth sought by the Government. \n \n9.  Accordingly, four key areas need to be strengthened. First, the PAA document has to be \nmainstreamed  at  the  departmental  and  provincial  level  as  the  main  policy  and  planning \ndocument of the Government in support of the budget process. Its linkages to the corporate and \nbusiness plans have to be established and understood. Political commitment and ownership are \nimperative. Second, the GIP and the financial and policy analysis skills of DESP and line \nagency staff need to be strengthened. Third, DESP needs to review its GIP processes and \nsystems and develop proactive and effective links with productive sector ministries and line \nagencies. This will involve simplifying the GIP systems and procedures for (i) reviewing the \nrelevance and consistency of all postdated projects in the system; (ii) identifying and appraising \ninvestment options in consultation with the line ministries and MBC; (iii) evaluating, selecting, \nand prioritizing 3\u20134 investments, which will constitute the annual GIP, as short, medium, and \nlong term; and (iv) packaging the GIP in a form that will be useful for the development partners \nand in time for the annual consultative group meetings. Such links are necessary for DESP to \nfulfill its tasks of assembling the GIP and of building capacities within line agencies to implement \nexternally funded projects. Fourth, the role of the aid coordination and management unit has to \nbe refocused to ensure harmonization of donor programs and funding of approved prioritized \npolicies and programs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The TA\u2019s purpose is to develop a medium-term strategic framework that will create a \nbasis for setting priorities of sector development plans, corporate plans, departmental budgets, \nand  project  proposals.  Specific  outputs  will  include  (i)  a  revised  PAA  that  clarifies  policy \nobjectives and establishes linkages to budget outcomes, (ii) a simplified GIP that aligns with the \nPAA, (iii) well-focused project proposals, (iv) a project-costing manual, (v) strengthened capacity ", "4 \nof  staff  and  implementing  agencies,  and  (vi)  improved  coordination  of  externally  assisted \nprojects (Appendix 1).  \n \n11.  This TA will focus on conceptualizing and entrenching the PAA framework, which will \nsupport improved management as well as policy development and capacity building consistent \nwith Vanuatu\u2019s development strategy. By strengthening the medium-term strategic framework \nprocess of prioritizing policies and projects and allocation of resources to strategic priorities \nbetween and within sectors, the TA is expected to improve financial management and use of \nlimited financial resources, which can ultimately lead to sustainable economic growth. The TA \nbuilds  on  previous  and  ongoing  assistance  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners.4 \nLessons  learned  from  ADB  work  will  be  applied  under  this  TA.  In  particular,  Government \nofficials will coordinate, manage, and implement change under the guidance of TA consultants, \nand initiate consultation and dissemination of TA results with Government and nongovernment \nstakeholders to entrench ownership. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will develop a medium-term strategic framework focused on developing capacity \nof the concerned agency staff through mentoring and training programs. Activities will include (i) \nrefining the process of formulating medium- and long-term Government priorities and prioritizing \ndevelopment interventions through the PAA; (ii) reviewing all projects in the GIP and removing \nthose that do not meet the costing guidelines for updating and resubmission by the sponsor \nagency; (iii) developing a process to regularly review and update the GIP; (vi) developing new \ncosting procedures and requirements for Government projects to be included in the GIP; (v) \nclarifying the roles of and linkages between DESP and the aid management and coordination \nunit;  (vi)  strengthening the  decision  and  coordination  roles  of  the MBC;  (vii)  conducting a \nmentoring program to assist and train implementing agency staff to prepare and cost project \nproposals; and (viii) conducting training programs for staff of implementing agencies on the \nrevised PAA process and policy development; GIP process; cost-benefit analysis; aspects of \nproject identification, evaluation, selection, monitoring, and data gathering; effective leadership; \nproject-costing manual; and best international practices in financial governance and sound \npublic management. Counterpart staff will prepare regular reports to record daily activities and \ninteractions with the consultants as part of the mentoring program. \n \n13.  For  the  PAA  framework  to  be  well  entrenched  and  widely  accepted  by  users, \nconsultation and information dissemination workshops will be carried out in Port Vila and Santo \nfor  government  institutions,  the  private  sector,  and  civil-society  organizations.  Possible \nworkshop topics will include, among others, understanding the workings of the PAA and its \nrelationship  to  the  GIP;  practical  case  studies  of  good  international  practices  on  financial \ngovernance;  public  expenditure  management;  effective  leadership  and  decision-making \nprocesses within the budget framework; how private sector and poverty reduction priorities can \nbe  set  within  the  framework  and  integrating  them  within  general  economic  policies,  etc. \nAccordingly, participation and active engagement of Government ministers and officials, the \nprivate sector, and civil-society representatives will be ensured during TA implementation.

A parallel development relates to the development of a regional training program in \npublic expenditure management (PEM) to complement the capacity building proposed under \nthis  TA  as  a  means  of  building  long-term  sustainability.  The  Pacific  Financial  Technical \nAssistance Centre5 in Fiji is sponsoring the development of a PEM  training program that will be \none of five compulsory courses of a new master of arts in Governance at the University of the \nSouth Pacific, scheduled to start in the second half of 2004. The course will also be available as \na stand-alone subject through distant learning, conferring a certificate in PEM. Accordingly, \nsenior  public  sector  executives  seeking  to  further  their  management  and  financial  skills \nappropriate to their new, more developed operating environment, can access the university.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $650,000 equivalent, including foreign exchange costs of \n$467,900  and  local  currency  costs  of  $182,100  equivalent.  ADB  will  finance  $500,000 \nequivalent,  covering  the  total  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $32,100  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment will provide $150,000 equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office facilities, and \nother expenditures (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA Executing Agency will be MFEM. The implementing agencies will be DESP, aid \nmanagement and coordination unit in the MFA, and selected line agencies responsible for \nproductive sectors. To facilitate coordination between the TA and implementing agencies, a \nproject  coordination  committee  (PCC)  will  be  established,  chaired  by  the  director  general, \nMFEM. The PCC will comprise the directors general from the Ministry of the Prime Minister; \nMFEM;  MFA;  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Fisheries,  and  Forestry;  Ministry  of  Internal  Affairs; \nSecretary to the Public Service Commission; directors from DESP; Department of Strategic \nManagement; one private sector nominee;6 and ADB. Other members may be coopted to the \nPCC if needed. The PCC will oversee implementation of TA activities, and PCC chair will report \nto the central agency committee. The PCC will meet quarterly to review work in progress, review \nrevisions to Government procedures and institutional changes, and guide interdepartmental \ntraining activities. Other donor agency representatives in the PCC will participate as observers \nas needed.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 30 months, intermittently, from September 2004 to \nFebruary 2007. It will require the services of three international consultants recruited from a firm \nfor 16 person-months (i) public finance specialist cum aid management advisor for 10 person-\nmonths,  (ii)  institutional  development  specialist  for  2  months,  and  (iii)  project  financial \nmanagement specialist for 4 months. The public finance specialist cum aid management advisor \nwill be the team leader. The outline terms of reference, including reporting requirements for the \nconsulting team, are in Appendix 3. ADB will engage the consulting firm using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method, with simplified technical proposals, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB contributes to the operations and work of the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre. \n6  The private sector representative may be from either the Chamber of Commerce or Bankers\u2019 Association. ", "6 \n18.  The  consulting  team  will submit  an  inception  report  1 month  after  commencement, \nmonthly  progress  reports  summarizing  any  issues  and  actions  taken  to  address  them,  a \nmidterm  report,  a  draft  final  report,  and  a  final  report.  A  tripartite  meeting  between  the \nGovernment, consulting firm, and ADB will be held to discuss the draft final report. Specific \nreporting requirements are in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Vanuatu for the Development of a Medium-Term Strategic Framework, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \nImprove the  \u2022 Increased and  \u2022 Monitoring of gross \nGovernment\u2019s financial  sustainable economic  domestic product  \nand aid management  growth resulting from  growth \nsystems and develop  effective policy-based   \nlinkages and  budgeting \nprocedures to use   \nfinancial resources   \nmore effectively     \n \n1.
