INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Georgia requested policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help develop an enabling framework for public\u2013\nprivate  partnerships  (PPPs)  in  the  country.  A  fact-finding  mission  was  conducted  via \nvideoconference on 23 October 2015 to firm up the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consultants that had \nbeen discussed during the consultation mission.1  On 20 November 2015, the government \nexpressed its concurrence with the agreements reached during the fact-finding mission, as \ndescribed in the mission\u2019s aide memoire on 26 October 2015. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  infrastructure and social service needs of Georgia are greater than the public \nresources available to meet them. Since 2003, the government has introduced a series of wide-\nranging economic and institutional reforms to create an enabling environment for private sector \ninvestors. These reforms have transformed Georgia\u2019s business and economic environment. \n \n3.  Private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  development  and  its  contribution  to \neconomic growth has greatly expanded through the government\u2019s efforts. PPP projects have \nbeen implemented since 2010 by government ministries or agencies in the health, energy, \nhospitality, and water sectors, among others. Financing for these PPPs has been provided by \nnational and international commercial banks and government financial institutions such as the \nPartnership Fund and the Georgian Energy Development Fund, and such private funds as the \nCo-investment  Fund.  Despite  some  successful  examples  of  private  participation  in  the \ndevelopment  of  infrastructure  and  services,  the  government  needs  to  develop  a \ncomprehensive legal, regulatory, institutional and financial framework to make more effective \nuse of PPPs in procuring public infrastructure and services. \n \n4.  The  government\u2019s  experience  with  PPPs  so  far  has  provided  several  lessons  and \nestablished particular needs. First, the country\u2019s public and private entities may need to explore \na variety of partnership modes for delivering infrastructure and social services. Second, the \ngovernment and potential partners will need a shared, broad-based understanding of what \nPPPs are and what they can contribute to Georgia\u2019s development targets before a robust \nportfolio of PPPs can be developed. Third, the clear and complete legal, regulatory, institutional, \nand financial framework for PPPs will be needed to help provide this full understanding and give \nboth public and private parties the confidence to pursue PPPs. Fourth, a more structured and \nstandardized approach to PPPs is needed to enable public sector entities to reduce transaction \ncosts and their risks when negotiating contracts. This should include standard contracts for \nsimilar projects. With a transparent, predictable, and standardized regulatory framework that \nclearly optimizes the allocation of risk and reward between public and private sector partners, \nprivate sector participation in infrastructure and services will increase and improve the overall \nefficiency and effectiveness of Georgia\u2019s public infrastructure and service delivery. \n                                                \n1  An ADB reconnaissance mission to Tbilisi in March 2015 discussed the current needs and possible scope of the \nTA for Development of Public\u2013Private Partnerships with key stakeholders from the public and private sectors and \nwith Georgia\u2019s other development partners. An ADB aide memoire summarizing the TA concept and preliminary \ndesign and monitoring framework was shared with the government in April 2015 and discussed with key \nstakeholders during a 21\u201329 July 2015 consultation mission to Tbilisi. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 August 2015. \n ", "2 \n5.  The  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Sustainable  Development  (MOESD)  is  currently \ncoordinating government policy and institutional activities for establishing the PPP framework in \nGeorgia. The Fiscal Forecasting Department of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) is developing the \nframework to identify and manage the fiscal risks associated with PPPs, including contingent \nliabilities. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n6.  The TA will help enhance the public sector\u2019s capacity to use PPPs as an effective means \nto  develop  economic  and  social  infrastructure,  particularly  by  clearly  delineating  and \nstreamlining the role of the government in key phases of the PPP process.3 This in turn will \ncontribute to Georgia\u2019s overall economic development. The government\u2019s ability to properly \nselect, appraise, develop, and implement sound PPP projects will be improved. The MOF \ncapabilities to assess the risks of PPP projects and to manage them will be strengthened. The \nTA will develop standard contracts and tender documents for PPPs. \n \n7.  The TA will include extensive awareness and capacity development activities for public \nand private sector representatives and potential investors and financiers. Staff working on PPPs \nin the MOESD, the MOF, and in sector ministries will be trained to apply the government\u2019s PPP \npolicy  and  use  the  PPP  documents  effectively.  TA  capacity  development  activities  will  be \ncoordinated with the Academy of the Ministry of Finance and delivered at its well-equipped \ntraining facilities. The activities will (i) cover regular training sessions for key stakeholders in the \npublic and private sector, (ii) initiate cost-effective train-the-trainer programs for PPPs, and (iii) \nincorporate PPP training into the government\u2019s core capacity development curriculum. The \nacademy has been providing training to public sector employees on management, financial \nmanagement, and good business practices through public and private sector trainers since \n2013. \n \n8.  The  European  Bank for  Reconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD),  the  International \nFinance Corporation, the World Bank, and ADB have been helping Georgia develop its private \nsector through support for business environment reforms, financial market development, and \nprivate investments. The United States Agency for International Development engages in policy \nadvice, capacity building, private sector surveys, and pilot programs for small businesses and \nrural development. German development cooperation through KfW supports the financing of \neconomic infrastructure, a regional small business fund, and the development of value chains \nfor agribusinesses and rural finance.4 During the TA reconnaissance and consultation missions, \nADB held discussions with these development partners to identify synergies that will be further \ndeveloped during TA implementation. \n \n9.  In the area of PPPs, the EBRD is providing TA to the government through the MOESD \nto draft a PPP policy and a PPP law. The ADB TA consultants and staff will be part of the \nworking group established by the MOESD to develop this policy and law. The TA will build on \nthe outputs produced from August 2015 until March 2016 under EBRD\u2019s TA and also on the \noutputs produced under ADB\u2019s TA being implemented under a program loan.5 Overall, the \n                                                \n3  The key phases in the PPP process are project identification (strategic planning, pre-feasibility, PPP suitability, and \ninternal  clearances);  project  development  (feasibility,  preparation  of  the  procurement  process,  in-principle \nclearance by appraisal authority, procurement, final clearance, and contract award); and project implementation \n(contract management and implementation monitoring). \n4  ADB. 2015.

Gap analyses of the legal and regulatory framework for PPPs has been completed under this TA, which was \n ", "  3\nADB  TA  will  help  the  government  develop  and  adopt  a  conducive  legal,  institutional,  and \nfinancial framework for PPPs and improve the government\u2019s capacity to effectively develop PPP \nprojects within this framework. \n \n10.  The  TA  is  fully  aligned  with  Georgia's  Socioeconomic  Development  Strategy  2020, \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Georgia for 2014\u20132018, and ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of \nStrategy 2020\u2014all of which prioritize the improvement of public service delivery and private \nsector participation to achieve inclusive growth.6 \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be an enabling environment for PPPs in Georgia. The outcome will be an \nimproved legal, institutional, and financial framework for developing and implementing viable \nPPP projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  TA  outputs  to  help  achieve  the  outcome  will  be  (i)  the  improvement  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s abilities to select, develop, and implement PPP projects, (ii) the strengthening of \nthe MOF\u2019s capacity to manage risks in PPP projects, and (iii) the standardization of PPP \ndocumentation.  Key  risks  to  effective  TA  implementation  are  the  possibility  that  (i)  the \ngovernment may not fully implement agreed policy and institutional arrangements for PPPs, (ii) \nthe key sector ministries and agencies will not retain, for at least 2 years, the critical mass of \ntrained PPP focal staff, and (iii) the EBRD outputs are not delivered within the time frame \nagreed between the EBRD and the government. To manage and mitigate these risks, ADB \nidentified the PPP focal staff in the central and sector counterpart ministries and agencies \nduring  the  TA  reconnaissance  mission  and  will  work  with  them  to  ensure  the  timely \nimplementation of policy and institutional arrangements. The TA builds on previous ADB work \non PPPs, and the project will continue to collaborate closely with development partners that \nsupport PPPs and private sector development in Georgia. Working with the Academy of the \nMinistry of Finance, the project will develop and conduct training sessions on the policy, legal, \ninstitutional, financial, and technical aspects of PPPs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office and housing accommodation, \noffice supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe value of government counterpart support is estimated to account for about 9% of the total \nTA cost. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The MOESD will be the executing agency for this TA. The implementing agencies will be \na focal group in the MOESD, including the National Agency of State Property, the Transport \n                                                                                                                                                       \napproved for $500,000 in September 2014. Analysis of the risk management capacity of the MOF has also been \ncarried out, and recommendations to strengthen it have been made to the government.  \n6  Government of Georgia. 2014.

The TA project will \nalso work with the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Justice, and Tbilisi Municipality when this is \nnecessary  during  implementation.  The  Public  Management,  Financial  Sector,  and  Trade \nDivision of ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department will administer the TA. The TA is expected \nto be implemented over a 20-month period from January 2016 to August 2017. \n \n15.  Four consultants will be engaged by ADB for a total of 16 person-months to provide \npolicy advice and technical and capacity development assistance during TA implementation. \nThe consultant team will include an international PPP specialist (engaged intermittently for 5 \nperson-months), an international PPP finance specialist (5 person-months), an international \nPPP legal specialist (4 person-months), and a national PPP legal specialist (2 person-months). \nThe  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  on  an  individual  basis  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). They will be \nengaged on output-based lump sum contracts to reduce the administrative burden on the \ngovernment and ADB and improve economy, efficiency, and value for money. Disbursements \nwill be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). Indicative consultant terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  The TA was designed in consultation with key stakeholders in the public and private \nsector and with multilateral and bilateral development agencies. Consultations and collaboration \nwith  these  counterparts  will  continue  during  TA  implementation.  They  will  be  invited  to \nparticipate in the PPP awareness-building workshops and focus group discussions that will be \nsupported by the TA. \n \n17.  PPP training and reference materials developed under the TA will be used for the TA \ncapacity development activities. They will also be shared with the Academy of the Ministry of \nFinance to help develop its in-house capacity to (i) continue the PPP training over the medium \nterm, (ii) train additional trainers for PPP capacity development, and thereby (iii) institutionalize \nPPP capacity development to ensure that a critical mass of the staff developing and managing \nPPP projects are well-versed in the core PPP concepts and principles. TA reports and model \nPPP  contracts\u2014developed  in  consultation  with  key  counterparts  and  beneficiaries\u2014will  be \nmade widely available for use in the public and private sectors. A study tour will be conducted \nfor staff members from the key implementing agencies to learn from their peers in an ADB \nmember country with extensive PPP experience. \n \n18.  During implementation, ADB staff will work closely with the implementing agencies to \nensure that the outputs and outcomes are achieved and remedial measures are implemented in \na timely manner when required. Consultant inputs and deliverables will be monitored directly by \nADB  staff  and  through  the  feedback  solicited  from  the  implementing  agencies  and  other \nstakeholders benefiting from the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Georgia for Development of Public\u2013Private Partnerships, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n ", "  Appendix 1  5   \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Technical Assistance is Aligned with \n \nAn enabling environment for PPPs in Georgiaa \nData Sources and \nPerformance Indicators with  Reporting \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nLegal, institutional, and  a.
