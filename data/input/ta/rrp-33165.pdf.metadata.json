Its\nbasin spans 800,000 square kilometers (km2) and is home\nto 107 million people. The Yellow River Basin is frequently\naffected by floods resulting in devastating economic and\nsocial losses. The Project will reduce flooding incidence in\nthe  most  flood-prone  part  in  the  lower  reaches  of  the\nbasin.  This  will  be  achieved  by  a  combination  of\nnonstructural  and  structural  measures  including  (i)\nstrengthening the capacity of the Government agencies\nconcerned  for  adopting  an  integrated  approach  to  the\nmanagement  of  the  Yellow  River  basin,  (ii)  introducing\nstate-of-the-art  river  embankments  and  reservoir  flood\ncontrol  systems  technology,  (iii)  reforestation  along  the\nriver embankments, and (iv) raising the village platform\nabove flood levels at the most vulnerable sites.\nClassification Economic Growth\nEnvironmental Protection\nEnvironmental Assessment Category B\nAn initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken\nfor core subprojects and a summary IEE was circulated to\nthe Board on 2 February 2001. The IEE concludes that the\nnegative environmental impacts arising from construction\nand  operation  of  project  facilities  can  be  mitigated  to\nacceptable levels through implementation of appropriate\nmeasures adopted in the project design.\nRationale Frequent flooding is a major constraint to socioeconomic\ndevelopment  in  the  Yellow  River  basin,  particularly  the\nlower  reaches.  Past  measures  to  contain  floods,  which\nemphasized structural approaches, had limited success.\nInternational  experience  suggests  that  floods  are  most\neffectively addressed through an optimal combination of\nstructural  and  nonstructural  measures,  following  an\napproach to comprehensive basin management. This is in\nline with Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) water policy\npaper  and  the  technical  assistance  TA  2817-PRC:\nStrategic  Options  for  Water  Resources  Management\napproved in June 1997, which emphasized the need to\nshift from flood control to flood management.\nThe emphasis on flood management by PRC authorities\nhas been heightened by the devastating floods in 1998,\nwhich affected 7.33 million houses, caused 3,656 deaths,\naffected 25 million hectares of farmlands, and resulted in\nmonetary losses estimated at Y248.4 billion ($30 billion\nequivalent). The approach to flood management includes", "iii\nlimiting development in flood retention areas, conserving\nnatural lakes, strengthening vulnerable embankments, and\nimproving flood forecasting and early warning systems. A\nY27.6  billion  (about  $3.3  billion  equivalent)  flood\nmanagement plan incorporating those approaches for the\nlower reaches of the Yellow River has been prepared by\nthe Government for implementation during 2001-2005. The\nproposed Project forms part of the Government\u2019s plan and\nis aimed at preventing human catastrophes and economic\nlosses caused by floods in the basin. ADB has played an\nimportant  role  in  promoting  the  comprehensive  basin\nmanagement  approach  adopted  in  the  plan,  and  its\ncontinued involvement in implementing the plan will help\ninstitutionalize  the  approach  in  the  management  of  the\nYellow River and other basins in the PRC.\nObjective and Scope The objective of the Project is to reduce the incidence of\nand damage from flooding in the lower Yellow River basin\nthrough improved flood management. The Project scope\ncomprises  (i)  institutional  development  and  capacity\nbuilding  of  the  Yellow  River  Conservancy  Commission\n(YRCC), (ii) rehabilitating and upgrading existing structural\nand  nonstructural  measures  for  flood  control,  (iii)\ndeveloping  flood  protection  measures  for  vulnerable\nvillages  at  selected  sites,  and  (iv)  supporting  project\nmanagement.\nCost Estimates and The total cost of the Project is estimated at $404.7 million\nFinancing Plan equivalent,  consisting  of  a  foreign  exchange  cost  of\n$150.27  million  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  $254.43\nmillion equivalent. The Government has requested for a\nloan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources\nfor the Project. The Government of Denmark has agreed\nto provide $300,000 as an untied grant from the Danish\nCooperation Fund for Technical Assistance for the flood\nforecasting and early warning system, to be administered\nby ADB.\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost\nAsian Development Bank 150.00     0.00 150.00\nDanish Government     0.27     0.03     0.30\nCentral Government     0.00 224.30 224.30\nLocal Government\n   and Beneficiaries     0.00   30.10   30.10\n       Total 150.27 254.43 404.70\nPercentage 37 63 100\nLoan Amount and Terms A  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital\nresources  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based\nlending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,", "iv\nincluding  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate\ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based\nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per\nannum, a front end fee of 1.0 percent, conversion options\nthat may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the\ndraft Loan Agreement, the Loan Regulations and ADB\u2019s\nConversion  Guidelines,  and  such  other  terms  and\nconditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan  and  Project\nAgreements.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2006\nExecuting Agency The  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  (MWR)  will  be  the\nExecuting  Agency.  MWR  will  entrust  project\nimplementation to YRCC, which is under the administrative\ncontrol of the ministry. YRCC was established in 1933. It is\nwell-staffed and has a good capacity to undertake project\nimplementation.  The  village  flood  protection  component\nwill  be  implemented  by  YRCC  in  cooperation  with  the\nconcerned  county  and  township  governments  and  with\nbeneficiary participation.\nProcurement All civil works, equipment, and materials will be procured in\naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Major\ncontracts  for  equipment  and  materials  will  be  tendered\nthrough international competitive bidding or international\nshopping procedures. Civil works contracts up to $5 million\nequivalent will be awarded under local competitive bidding\nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Civil works for the village\nflood protection component, estimated at $1 million or less\nper  package,  will  be  implemented  under  force  account\nprocedures. Advance action for procurement of equipment\nand vehicles and  civil works for three core subprojects\nhas been approved.\nConsulting Services The Project will require 80 person-months of international\nand 1,150 person-months of domestic consulting services\nfor  the  engineering  study,  project  management,\nenvironmental  protection,  and  social  development.  The\ninternational  consultants,  including  consultants  to  be\nfinanced by the Government of Denmark, will be selected\nand engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants, and other arrangements satisfactory\nto ADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants.\nEstimated Project 31 December 2005\nCompletion Date\nProject Benefits and The  Project  beneficiaries  total  approximately  85  million\nBeneficiaries residents who will benefit directly from protection of losses\nof assets and risk of death and injury. They live in an area\nof  117,900  km2  traversing  the  provinces  of  Henan,", "v\nShandong,  Anhui,  and  Jiangsu.  Within  this  area,  those\nsections  that  constitute  the  floodplain  are  also  densely\npopulated, totaling about 33 million in 43 counties. Of this\npopulation,  about  12  million  people  are  especially\nvulnerable to floods, 3.9 million are poor, and 8.2 million\npeople  are  just  living  above  the  poverty  line.  This\npopulation would have meager or no resources to recover\nfrom major floods.\nThe  Project  beneficiaries  would  also  benefit  from\nemployment opportunities related to construction activities\nto  be  implemented  under  the  subprojects,  mainly  the\nembankments  and  village  platforms.  The  Project  is\nexpected to create approximately 23.5 million person-days\nof  unskilled  labor,  equivalent  to  3-month  duration\nconstruction employment for 52,000 laborers per year for\nfour  years.  The  job  opportunities  are  targeted  at  poor\nfamilies, and would generate about Y41 million in wage\nincome.  The  population  resettled  on  village  platforms\nwould also benefit from the quality of life improvements\nrelated to improved public utilities such as water and road\naccess.\nTechnical Assistance A TA is proposed in conjunction with the proposed loan to\nconduct a Strategic Planning Study for the Preparation of\nthe  Yellow  River  Law  to  address  water  resources\nmanagement  through  the  adoption  of  a  unified\nadministration  defining  the  rights  and  responsibilities  of\neach  relevant  department  and  local  government\nconcerned.  The  TA  will,  among  others,  undertake\ncomprehensive  studies  pertaining  to  the  issues  for\neffective  water  resources  management  and  sustainable\nsocioeconomic  development  of  the  Yellow  River  basin,\nand prepare policy and legal recommendations related to\nthe  formulation  of  the  Yellow  River  Law.  The  TA  will\nprovide about 17 person-months of international and 63\nperson-months of domestic consulting services.\nThe TA costs are estimated at $1.27 million equivalent,\ncomprising  $562,000  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and\n$708,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  ADB  will\nprovide $970,000, on a grant basis, from the ADB-funded\nTA program to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and\npart  of  the  local  currency  cost  equivalent  to  $408,000.\nMWR  will  meet  the  balance  of  the  local  currency  cost\nequivalent to $300,000 by providing office accommodation,\ncounterpart  staff,  field  surveys,  and  logistical  support.\nConsultants will be selected and engaged in accordance\nwith  ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants,  and\nother arrangements for the selection and engagement of\ndomestic consultants.", "vi", "vii", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1.

INTRODUCTION\n2. The Yellow River basin is PRC\u2019s cradle of civilization because early dynasties emerged\nfrom its middle basin along the Wei River valley near the present city of Xi\u2019an. For centuries,\npeople who lived along the Yellow River had suffered from periodic floods. The last 3,500 years\nsaw 26 significant changes in the lower Yellow River\u2019s course. The river settled into its present\nchannel in 1855. All major dynasties made tremendous efforts to control floods along the Yellow\nRiver. However, constructing flood control facilities was formidable work because the river is\nsuspended at the lower reaches due to the heavy sediment load from upstream. Because\nflooding and drought throughout history, and the consequent impact on poverty, in the Yellow\nRiver basin have been frequent and serious, particularly in the lower reaches, the river became\nknown as the \"sorrow of the PRC.\"\n3. In August 1999, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a TA to prepare a Yellow\nRiver Flood Management Sector Project.1 The TA assisted the Ministry of Water Resources\n(MWR) to prepare the feasibility study for a flood management project in the lower reaches of\nthe Yellow River. The consultant\u2019s draft final report was submitted in September 2000. A Loan\nAppraisal Mission2 was fielded in December 2000 to discuss the project, objective, scope, cost,\nand project implementation arrangements. This report is based on the results of the TA reports,\nGovernment  feasibility  studies,  findings  of  ADB  missions,  and  discussions  with  central,\nprovincial and local government officials, and beneficiaries. The linkages between the goals,\nobjectives, outputs, and inputs are shown in the project framework in Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  Floods\n4. Population  and  economic  activity  in  the  PRC  have  increasingly  moved  onto  the\nfloodplains of major rivers. Despite massive investments in flood control and other works, flood\ndamage has increased with every major flood as evidenced during the floods of 1998. At the\nsame time, the combined demands for water for municipal supply, irrigation, industry, power,\nand other uses exceed the available resources, and shortages of water for municipal supply and\nirrigation are emerging as major problems, especially in northern PRC.\n                                                \n1  TA 3259-PRC: Yellow River Flood Management Sector Project, for $930,000, approved on 22 September 1999.\n2 The  Mission  comprised  T.  Miyazato,  Senior  Project  Engineer  and  Mission  Leader;  E.  Brotoisworo,  Senior\nEnvironment Specialist; S.T. Chew, Senior Poverty Specialist; E. Gozali, Project Economist; M. Nagata, Senior\nProgram Officer; S. Price, Senior Social Development Specialist; V. You, Counsel; and Wu Guobao, Poverty\nSpecialist/Staff Consultant.", "2\n5. The PRC is afflicted with frequent floods. Its territory extends across upper, middle, and\nlower latitudes, and owing to the influence of the monsoons, the country typically has humid\nsummers and dry winters. The rainfall on land averages 648 millimeters (mm) a year, which is\nunevenly distributed over different regions and seasons. The average annual rainfall is over\n1,600 mm in the southeast coastal region, gradually decreasing to less than 200 mm in the\nnorthwest.  Generally,  over  half  of  the  yearly  precipitation  occurs  during  the  flood  season\nbetween July and September. The concentration of rainfall in time and space causes disastrous\nfloods. The typhoons that occur over the northwestern Pacific also bring calamitous floods. Over\na  period  of  38  years  (1949-1987),  281  of  1,114  typhoons  that  occurred  over  the  ocean\n(including the South China Sea) struck the PRC, bringing exceptionally heavy rains and causing\nserious losses in the coastal areas.\n6. Flooding  in  the  lower  Yellow  River  basin  has  created  widespread  hardship  for  all\nresidents  of  the  floodplains,  regardless  of  their  income  status.  Aside  from  direct  tangible\nfinancial  losses,  floods  inflict  major  social  costs  due  to  deaths,  injuries,  displacement  of\nhouseholds/communities, loss of personal belongings, and a general disruption to education,\nlivelihood, and family and social life. Relocating the flood victims to congested evacuation\ncamps exposes them to epidemics and social tension. Women, who form a significant but\nunderestimated percentage of the rural labor force, are typically burdened during flood events\nby obligations to obtain drinking water, fuel, and food; to help maintain the health of family\nmembers and livestock; and to protect household properties. Flood-affected families themselves\nmust contribute labor to relief and emergency works during the floods and to the cleanup and\nrecovery efforts after the floodwater recedes. In terms of livelihood, flooding in the river basin\ncauses subtler yet longer term losses to farm communities, as agricultural land suffers from a\ndecline in crop and tree yields due to waterlogging. In mitigating flood risks, the Project will\nsubstantially lessen the likelihood of these social losses and stresses for the residents of the\nfloodplains.\n7. Historical records show that between 206 BC and 1949 AD, more than 1,000 significant\nflood disasters occurred in the PRC, averaging one every two years. Notable recent floods\ninclude that of (i) the Huai River in 1931, inundating 4.27 million hectares (ha) of farmland and\ncausing  75,000  deaths;  (ii)  the  middle  and  lower  reaches  of  the  Yangtze  River  in  1931,\ninundating more than 3.3 million ha of farmland, affecting 28.5 million people, and causing\n145,000 deaths; and (iii) the Yellow River in 1933, affecting more than 3.6 million ha of farmland\nand causing 18,000 deaths. From 1949 to 1988, the affected area averaged about 7.9 million ha\nper year from large floods that occurred in 1954, 1956, 1963, 1964, and 1985. Although the\nnumber of deaths has declined, the costs of damage have increased.\n8. The most recent flood events occurred in 1996 and 1998. The 1996 flood affected some\n5.12  million  houses,  caused  4,400  deaths,  impacted  31  million  ha  farmland,  resulted  in\nmonetary losses of Y220.8 billion ($26.7 billion), and reduced gross domestic product (GDP) by\nabout 4 percent. The estimates for 1998 were 7.33 million houses, 3,656 deaths, 25 million ha\nfarmland,  Y248.4  billion  ($30  billion),  and  3-4  percent  reduction  in  GDP.  These  are  only\nestimates, but clearly the impacts have enormous implications for economic growth and human\nwelfare.\n2.  Yellow River Basin\n9. The Yellow River is the second largest river system in the PRC, covering nine provinces\nand autonomous regions: Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Shanxi,\nHenan, and Shandong. The river rises in the northern foothills of the Bayankala Mountains on", "3\nthe Qinghai Plateau at an elevation of 4,600 meters (m). The total drainage area is 795,000\nsquare kilometers (km2) and has a population of 107 million.  The main river is 5,464 kilometers\n(km) long (Map 1).\n10. The basin is divided into three reaches, each with distinctive characteristics:\n(i)  The upper reach on the Qinghai Plateau in the west of the basin at an elevation\nof over 4,000 meters above sea level (masl) is the main source of runoff in the\nbasin; there are many hydropower schemes in this area.\n(ii)  The middle reach joins the Hai River basin to the east with Mount Taihang as the\neastern boundary, at an elevation of 1,000-2,000 masl; the river flows through\nnarrow gorges, and the two largest dams, Sanmenxia and Xiaolangdi, are in the\ndownstream part of this area.\n(iii)  The lower reach downstream to the coast has a general elevation of less than\n100 masl, and is bounded by the hilly area of central Shandong at 400-1,000\nmasl; the river is suspended above the hinterland level throughout.  The estuary\narea lies below 10 m, and the river discharges into the Bohai Sea.\n11. Among the major river systems in the PRC, the Yellow River is the most complex in\nhydrology,  hydraulics,  ecology,  and  human  intervention.  The  following  are  the  principal\ncharacteristics of the basin:\n(i)  Fragile  ecological  environment.  The  middle  reach  flows  through  the  world's\nlargest loess plateau, with an area of 640,000 km2. Most of the area is arid and\nsemiarid. Drought, wind-blown sand, and soil loss are severe.3\n(ii)  Deficient in water and abundant in sediment. The annual average runoff for the\nYellow River is 58 billion cubic meters (m3), only one seventh that of the Mekong\nRiver with a comparable catchment area. The annual average sediment load is\n1.6 billion tons (t), making the Yellow River the most sediment-laden river in the\nworld.\n(iii)  Suspended river. The lower Yellow River has formed a suspended river with the\nriverbed generally 4-6 m higher than the adjacent ground. This is due to severe\nsoil loss in the middle reach and aggradation year by year within the confining\nflood embankments. The potential damage to settlements and agricultural land in\nthe event of embankment failure is high, as the surrounding terrain is a flat plain.\n(iv)  Radical  course  changes.  Avulsions4  have  taken  place  throughout  geological\ntimes. In the past four millennia, the river has entered the Yellow Sea at points up\nto 800 km away from the present river mouth. The last major avulsion took place\nin the 1850s.\n(v)  Wider  section  upstream  than  downstream,  with  a  correspondingly  higher\nconveyance capacity upstream. For example, the river width is around 10 km in\nHenan Province and 2-4 km in Shandong.\n                                                \n3 Loess is yellowish brown loamy soil, usually unstratified and prone to rain and wind erosion. ADB has helped to\naddress difficult soils under TA 1573-PRC: Red Soils Development in Hunan Province, for $789,000, approved on\n3 October 1991; TA 1615-PRC: Monitoring and Management of Fragile Ecosystems in Shanxi-Shaanxi-Inner\nMongolia, for $600,000, approved on 27 November 1991; TA 2042-PRC: West Henan Agricultural Development\nProject, for $600,000, approved on 29 December 1993; TA 2073-PRC: Changjiang Soil and Water Conservation\nand Environmental Protection, for $600,000, approved on 24 March 1994; TA 2119-PRC: Forest Ecosystem\nPlanning and Agro-industrial Pollution Control,  for  $600,000,  approved  on  30  June  1994;  TA  2156-PRC:\nImprovement of Grassland Ecosystem in North China, for $746,000, approved on 16 September 1994; and TA\n2407-PRC: Capacity Building for Soil and Water Conservation, for $590,000, approved on 28 September 1995.\n4  Sudden complete change in the course of a river, usually occurring during a flood.", "4\n12. The lower reach of the Yellow River runs through two provinces, Henan (upstream) and\nShandong (coastal area) in the central part of the Northern Plain, before flowing into the Bohai\nSea.  The total population of the two provinces is about 183 million: 94 million in Henan, the\nmost populous among PRC\u2019s provinces and autonomous regions, and 89 million in Shandong,\nwhich is highly industrialized. The total product of primary industry accounts for only 16 percent\nof the gross provincial product in Shandong, compared with about 25 percent in Henan. Henan\nis a major producer of wheat, corn, and cotton, mostly grown with irrigation. More than 80\npercent of the population in Henan lives in the rural area.\n13. Henan is a relatively poor interior province. In 1999, its per capita annual rural income\nwas Y1,948 ($235), 88 percent of the national rural average of Y2,210 ($266). Shandong is\nlocated in the developed coastal zone and average annual per capita income in its rural area\nwas Y2,550 ($307) in 1999, 31 percent higher than that in Henan. Among PRC\u2019s 31 provinces\nand autonomous regions, Henan ranked 19th in rural income, and Shandong 8th.\n14. Of the 113 counties in the flood-prone areas, 43 in Henan and Shandong are especially\nvulnerable to inundation since they are located along the Yellow River and its lower tributaries.\nThe counties at highest risk are densely populated, with 661 persons per km2 and a total\npopulation of 32.8 million. The rural population in the flood-prone area is estimated at 28.8\nmillion (87 percent of total), of which 10.7 million form part of the labor force. Available arable\nland is limited at about 0.09 ha per person. The 43 counties include the inner floodplains (i.e.,\nareas inside the main river embankments) that are home to 1.7 million residents living in 2,193\nvillages.\n15. The river reach downstream of the Dongping flood retention basin, about 400 km from\nthe  estuary,  located  in  Shandong  has  a  smaller  cross  section  with  only  about  half  the\nconveyance capacity of the channel upstream. This suggests that Dongping Lake has long been\na natural storage area for floods. The lake and an additional storage area to the south are\nencircled with high embankments, providing an effective flood storage capacity. The basin can\nbe flooded from the Yellow River via inlet flood sluices; drainage is partly to the Yellow River,\nand partly to the Huai River to the south, once the flood recedes. The Dongping flood retention\nbasin would be flooded in the event of a flood with a return period of around once in 25 years.\nThe storage capacity allows the river downstream to match the upstream reach.\n16. The loess plateau in the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River is the most\nseverely eroded area in the world.  The total eroded area is 454,000 km2: 337,000 km2 eroded\nby water and 117,000 km2 by wind. The heavily water-eroded area with an erosion modulus\ngreater than 5,000 t per km2 per year covers 146,500 km2, nearly 40 percent of the total area of\nthat category in the PRC.  The 36,700 km2 of severely water-eroded area with an erosion\nmodulus greater than 15,000 t per km2 per year accounts for 90 percent of the total in this\ncategory in the PRC. The high sediment load of the Yellow River originates mainly from the\nhighly erosive areas of the loess plateau, i.e., from Hekouzhen to Longmen and the middle and\nupper reaches of the Jing, Luo, and Wei rivers.\n17. Measures to control sediment involve major engineering works, most notably Xiaolangdi\nreservoir (funded by the World Bank), which is designed to trap and contain riverborne sediment\nfor about 20 years in the dead storage of the reservoir.5 Long-term measures include terracing,\ncheckdams, reforestation, planting of grasses, and promotion of horticulture in the eroding\n                                                \n5 Dead storage is the part of a reservoir from which water cannot be released from the lowest outlet.", "5\nareas. The Government plans to rehabilitate 157,300 km\u00b2 by 2010 (one third of the loess\nplateau), and to completely rehabilitate all affected areas by 2050.\n18. Building up farmland by terracing and utilizing land behind silt trap dams will increase\nagricultural output and allow the restoration of forest and grass on formerly cultivated sloping\nland. Vegetation cover may be improved or restored by introducing suitable species of trees,\ngrasses, and bushes in appropriate combinations.  The development of grass and forest areas\nconserves soil and water, and promotes the development of animal husbandry, forestry, and\norchards. Conservation farming to retain moisture and soil includes fallow fields, limited tillage,\ncultivating along contours, and contour furrow-and-ridge planting.\n19. Water consumption in the Northern Plain has been increasing at the rate of 4.7 percent\nannually. The average annual flow in the Yellow River is 58 billion m3. About 38 billion m3, or 65\npercent, is diverted for irrigation; 6.4 billion m3, or 11 percent, is used by industries and cities\nwithin the watershed; and 4.1 billion m3, or 7 percent, is diverted to cities outside the watershed\n(e.g., Zhengzhou City). In 1970, the Yellow River ran dry in stretches along Shandong for 21\ndays. In 1996, the dry period was 133 days and in 1997, it was 226 days.6 Water shortages\nhave contributed to the disappearance of wetland habitats__especially in the lower reaches__and\naggravated  the  decline  of  aquatic  fauna  and  the  existing  water-quality  problems.  Water\nshortages may lead to future social conflict, unrest, and food insecurity. The demand for water is\ncurrently so high that farmers face strong competition for water from local cities and industries.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n1.  1988 Water Law\n20. The Government has placed high priority on water resource management to minimize\nthe impacts of floods and droughts. The basic principles of water resource management are\nstated in the current implementing guidelines for the Water Law and related laws, such as the\nLaw on Water and Soil Conservation, Water Pollution Control, Flood Control, and Environmental\nProtection.\n(i)  Water resources are owned by the State, to be developed and utilized at its\ndiscretion. Control is to be exercised through a water rights system covering the\nconsumptive use of both groundwater and surface water.\n(ii)  A system for the unified administration of basinwide water resources is to be\nadopted  in  association  with  administration  at  various  levels  and  by  various\ndepartments throughout the country. Provinces retain responsibility for systems\nwithin their own territory.\n(iii)  Water pollution control is to be an integral part of the development and utilization\nof water resources.\n(iv)  Service entities are to charge water fees on all consumptive uses of both surface\nwater and groundwater.\n(v)  Allocation and consumption of water must be planned and economized through\ntechnical and organizational measures, and reuse promoted.\n21. The 1988 Water Law\u2019s structure and level of detail show flexibility and allow adjustments\nas conditions change and new management measures are devised. An extensive body of rules,\n                                                \n6 During the dry season in 2000, the Yellow River flow reached the sea without interruption due to strong\nGovernment pressure on water users in the upper and middle reaches of the river to limit use.", "6\nregulations, and specific legislation has evolved for implementing the law. Basin plans are to\nunderpin all other plans to ensure an optimum combination of alternatives to meet national and\nlocal goals. Basin plans are to serve as a main component of land use plans and economic and\nenvironmental plans, and they are to guide the rational layout of cities and townships and the\ndistricts\u2019 infrastructure. Special plans may be formulated to guide subsectors such as irrigation,\nflood control, drainage, and soil conservation.\n22. The 1988 Water Law provides for the principle of charging fees for the use of water in\naddition to charges for services. The fees, which vary by use and source, are to be assessed on\nall  consumptive  uses  and  certain  nonconsumptive  uses  such  as  hydropower  generation.\nCharges for all services should cover costs of infrastructure and expenses to maintain and\ndeliver  the  service.  Regional  flood  control  is  viewed  as  a  public  responsibility  of  the\nGovernment.  However,  charges  for  flood  control  benefits  are  levied  through  land  value\nassessments and direct labor along reaches of the rivers.\n23. To clarify the diverse responsibilities for water management, the Government is revising\nthe 1988 Water Law, which does not adequately address emerging issues. The revision will\nstipulate that water resources are to be administered in a holistic, unified way, not by sector.\nThe proposed amended Water Law has been discussed by the National People\u2019s Congress\n(NPC) and is expected to be approved shortly. For effective and efficient water management,\nimplementable mechanisms for water pricing and cost recovery will be stipulated.\n2.  1997 Flood Control Law\n24. The Flood Control Law, which NPC passed on 29 August 1997, came into force on 1\nJanuary 1998. This is the first law for preventing and controlling natural disasters (although\nthere have been previous administrative regulations promulgated under the water and other\nlaws) and thus filled a gap in the water legislation system. This law is important because it\naddresses the specific nature of causes and remedial measures to be taken to prevent and\ncontrol floods. It requires a unified and integrated planning approach with comprehensive river\nbasin plans prepared by the river basin commissions, and at administrative levels of local\ngovernment, specifically including urban areas. The law introduced the important mechanism of\ndesignating \"planned reserve zones/areas,\" where special rules may apply on water use and\nactivities. It further specifies requirements for operating reservoirs and other hydraulic works; for\nmultiple uses in river course realignments and lake embankments; and for preparing a flood\nimpact  assessment  for  projects  in  flood-prone  areas.    MWR  is  primarily  responsible  for\nimplementing this law.\n3.  River Basin Commissions\n25. As early as November 1949, the Government stated that use of water in any river must\nbe planned in a unified manner and managed in an integrated way so that water resources can\nbe  optimally  utilized.  The  principle  of  united  water  administration  relies  on  centralized\nmanagement  to  verify  water  rights  and  appraise,  decide,  and  initiate  water  conservation\nundertakings with multiple objectives. During the 1950s, river basin plans were completed for all\nseven major river basins. The importance of basin planning and management was confirmed by\nthe 1988 Water Law.\n26. There are currently six commissions for interprovincial river basins (Songhua-Liao, Hai,\nYellow,  Huai,  Yangtze,  and  Pearl)  and  one  lake  commission  (Tai)  under  the  direct\nadministration of MWR, but established with the consent of the State Council. The functions of", "7\nthe commissions are delegated to them by MWR. Many have been allocated responsibilities\nthat go beyond the particular river or lake basin concerned, so they essentially act as regional\noffices of the ministry. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCC) is authorized to act\nin some inland river basins (e.g., in Xinjiang) and the Tai Lake Commission was recently made\nresponsible for some rivers in Fujian Province. While the river basin commissions are primarily\nresponsible for the specific river or lake basins for which they are named and are widely seen to\nbe basin agencies, in practice they fall short of a true basin commission as they do not have the\nrequisite authority for implementing an integrated approach for water resource management.\n4.  River Basin Plans\n27. MWR is preparing a long-term Comprehensive River Basin Plan covering a period of 20-\n30 years for each of the seven major river basins.7 MWR has also prepared flood control plans,\nirrigation plans, water and ecology conservation plans, and water resources development plans\nfor each of the seven basins.\n28. YRCC prepared an Outline Management Plan for the Yellow River Basin covering the\nperiod 2000-2020. After review by MWR, YRCC submitted the plan to the State Development\nPlanning Commission (SDPC) in 1997. The objectives of the plan are to (i) reinforce the lower\nYellow River embankments to eliminate vulnerable locations, (ii) strengthen the riverbank and\ntrain the bed to control the shifting of the main stream, (iii) slow down the extension of the\nestuary into the sea, (iv) improve the safety of the Yellow River floodplain and reduce the losses\nand impacts of floods, and (v) strengthen nonstructural measures for flood management.\n29. MWR has prepared a medium-term plan for the Yellow River called a Program for 2010.\nIn addition, MWR prepared the Tenth Five-Year Plan (10th FYP) for the Yellow River (2001-\n2005) and submitted it to SDPC. For the lower reach of the Yellow River, the total investment\nunder the 10th FYP is estimated at Y27.6 billion (about $3.3 billion). The proposed Project will\ncover the implementation of the most urgent construction works of both structural measures and\nnonstructural measures included in the 10th FYP for the Yellow River.\n30. The major flood of 1998 in the Yangtze and Songhua rivers and drought in the Yellow\nRiver  basin  catalyzed  public  awareness  on  the  severity  of  the  degradation  of  the  natural\nvegetation and potential environmental and economic consequences. In response to the public\nconcern, the Government initiated a Natural Forest Protection Project to (i) terminate logging in\nnatural  forests  in  designated  provinces,  (ii)  convert  cultivated  sloping  land  to  forest  and\ngrassland, (iii) regenerate barren land, and (iv) restructure the forest industry and re-employ\nforest workers and affected farmers. This project for the upper and middle Yellow River was\nincorporated in the Great West Development Program in 2000.\n31. The  PRC  adopted  a  number  of  measures  to  protect  and  improve  the  ecological\nenvironment in the western region. Pilot programs were launched in 188 counties for restoring\nforest  and  grassland  in  700,000  ha  of  cultivated  land  to  prevent  soil  erosion.  In  addition,\n530,000 ha of mountainous areas were closed for afforestation. All sloping and ecologically\nimportant farmland with serious water and soil erosion problems will be restored as forest or\ngrassland in the next 5-10 years. The central Government also plans to bring under control the\nwater and soil erosion in areas totaling 20 million ha. Erosion by wind and sand storm will also\nbe controlled in areas totaling 26 million ha.\n                                                \n7  These rivers are Songhua, Liao, Hai-Luan, Yellow, Huai, Yangtze, and Pearl.", "8\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n1.  ADB\u2019s Operations in the Water Sector\n32. ADB\u2019s involvement in the water sector, especially in the water supply sector, has been\nsignificant.  ADB  has  provided  14  loans  for  water  supply,  wastewater  treatment,  and  flood\ndamage rehabilitation totaling $1,818 million since 1992. It has financed TAs in the environment,\nwater supply, and flood control sectors totaling $36.757 million: (i) 36 advisory TAs focused on\nthe  preparation  of  policies  and  strategies,  amounting  to  $23  million;  and  (ii)  16  project\npreparatory TAs amounting to $13.75 million. A list of TAs and loans is in Appendix 2.\n33. ADB has been increasingly involved in the water resource management sector including\nflood control since 1998. During implementation of the TA for strategic options for the water\nsector,8  ADB  invited  external  agencies  that  were  involved  in  the  water  sector  in  the\nPRC__Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  Canadian  International\nDevelopment Agency (CIDA), Deutsche Gesellschaf f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (German\nAgency  for  Technical  Cooperation)  [GTZ],  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  World\nBank__to several workshops to discuss the outcome of the study together with high-ranking PRC\nofficials in charge of policy and planning in the water sector (including an expert panel of senior\nadvisers in the sector). All participants recognized the value of the outcome of the study. The TA\nidentified seven major issues: (i) lack of unified water administration and management; (ii) gap\nbetween  policy,  planning,  and  implementation;  (iii)  inadequacy  of  financial  resources;  (iv)\nescalating flood damage; (v) water scarcity and inefficient water use; (vi) increasing water\npollution; and (vii) soil erosion and ecosystem degradation. Soil and water conservation projects\nthat contribute to poverty reduction are viewed as a potential area for future investment.\n34. ADB  is  currently  assisting  in  formulating  the  PRC-Global  Environment  Facility\npartnership to support implementation of a 10-year program to combat land degradation in\ndryland ecosystems in western PRC.9 The partnership will be guided by a country programming\nframework that will describe necessary policy, legislative, and institutional enabling factors;\nidentify  priority  ecoregions;  define  priority  investment  and  TA  interventions  and  their\nsequencing; and specify a monitoring and evaluation system. ADB has also provided TA totaling\n$6.15  million  for  strengthening  the  capacities  of  agencies  responsible  for  assessing  and\nmonitoring environmental impacts and formulating environmental protection laws.\n2.  Other External Assistance\n35. Right after the 1998 flood, the Government requested ADB assistance for the Northeast\nFlood Damage Rehabilitation Project.10 An informal understanding with the Government was\nthat ADB would handle the water sector projects in the northern part of the PRC while the World\nBank would attend to those in the southern part since the World Bank was involved in the\nYangtze dike strengthening project at that time.\n                                                \n8  TA 2817-PRC: Strategic Options for the Water Sector, for $1.18 million, approved on 26 June 1997.\n9  TA 3497-PRC: Global Environment Facility Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems, for $100,000,\napproved  on  5  September  2000;  TA  3657-PRC:  PRC-GEF Partnership on Land Degradation in Dryland\nEcosystems, for $800,000 (funded by ADB) and $350,000 (funded by GEF), approved on 25 May 2001; and TA\n3663-PRC: Optimizing Initiatives to Combat Desertification in Gansu Province, for $610,000, funded by the Japan\nSpecial Fund, approved on 5 June 2001.\n10 Loans 1685/1686/1687-PRC: Northeast Flood Damage Rehabilitation Project, for $110 million each, approved on\n22 April 1999.", "9\n36. The World Bank and a number of bilateral agencies11 have supported water resources\ndevelopment  and  flood  control  in  the  PRC.  The  World  Bank  has  been  involved  in  water\nresources projects in major river basins, particularly the Yangtze River (Tai Lake Basin Flood\nControl, Yangtze River Water Resources Development Plan, and Yangtze Dike Strengthening)\nand the Yellow River (Xiaolangdi Multipurpose I and II,12 Xiaolangdi Resettlement,13 and Loess\nPlateau Watershed Rehabilitation14). The World Bank, in assisting such large-scale projects,\nmixed its ordinary loans and concessional International Development Association\u2019s credits. The\nmain policy and sector issues addressed in its flood protection projects are (i) rational and\nstandardized approach for improving flood control infrastructure facilities, and (ii) financial and\nphysical sustainability of flood protection facilities.\n37. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) has financed several multipurpose\ndam projects, most of which have flood protection as one of the objectives. With the introduction\nof  more  concessional  terms  and  conditions15  for  projects  aimed  at  global  environment\nimprovement and pollution control in 1997, JBIC has been more actively involved in flood\ncontrol projects including an afforestation project in the upper reach of the Yellow River basin.\nThe Japan International Cooperation Agency has been funding grant projects related to water\nresources and the flood protection sector, such as human resources development, afforestation,\nand soil stabilization in the loess plateau.\n38.   AusAID  approved  the  Yangtze  River  Flood  Control  and  Management  Project  in\nFebruary 2001 to improve the capacity of the Yangtze Water Resources Commission (YWRC)\nto deliver timely and accurate flood forecasts. AusAID and ADB plan to jointly sponsor a\nworkshop for YRCC and YWRC on nonstructural work and to share the initial findings of each\nproject. CIDA has been providing grant assistance to control soil erosion in the middle reach of\nthe Yellow River. CIDA is also currently considering assistance for strategic flood management\nand flood control management systems.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n39. International experience suggests that floods are most effectively addressed through an\noptimal combination of structural and nonstructural measures. In the past, the PRC had tended\nto stress structural approaches, but now it increasingly recognizes the need to move toward a\nmore comprehensive approach by conducting a broad-ranging review of flood-related policies\nand practices. This trend accelerated after the devastating 1998 floods. Flood control is being\nconsidered as integral to soil and water conservation. Other aspects will include flood-proofing\nand limiting development in flood retention areas, conserving natural lakes, and strengthening\nvulnerable embankments.\n40. The importance of sound watershed management was pointed out in a number of\nproject performance audit reports (PPARs). Many communities have experienced increasing\nand severe flooding after storms or prolonged rains partly due to the effects of denudation of\n                                                \n11These include the Japan Bank for International Cooperation/Japan International Cooperation Agency (JBIC/JICA),\nAustralian Agency for International Development (AusAID), Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA),\nand Danish International Development Assistance (Danida).\n12 Project ID: P003562 and P034081. Total project cost amounted to $2,855.8 million, of which $890 million was\nfinanced by the World Bank.\n13 Project ID: P003644, Xiaolangdi Resettlement Project, for $110 million, approved on 14 April 1994.\n14 Project ID: P056215, Second Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Project, for $150 million, approved on 25\nMay 1999; and Project ID: P003540, Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Project, for $150 million, approved\non 26 May 1994.\n15Interest rate of 0.75 percent per annum, with repayment of 40 years including a grace period of 10 years.", "10\nforested uplands and watersheds. Similarly, the sector synthesis of postevaluation findings in\nthe  irrigation  and  rural  development  sector  pointed  out  how  lack  of  proper  watershed\nmanagement endangers irrigation and rural development projects.16 Postevaluation experience\nin  the  flood  control  sector  also  recommends  strengthening  of  integrated  river  basin\nmanagement. In designing river basin development projects, an integrated and coordinated\napproach involving upper watershed management and conservation, and downstream rural\ndevelopment must be simultaneously and effectively carried out.\n41. ADB\u2019s experience with rehabilitation assistance after a disaster was reviewed in 1998 to\nidentify lessons learned and emerging issues that are also useful to the flood control sector\nprojects. Although the projects reviewed were generally rated as successful, their achievements\nin terms of rapid restoration of facilities to ensure continuity of productive and social life were\nsometimes  below  expectations.  Considerable  delays  occurred  in  implementation  due  to  (i)\ndelayed compliance with the conditions for loan effectiveness, (ii) institutional weaknesses in\nimplementing agencies, (iii) slower-than-expected procurement of consulting services and other\nproject inputs, (iv) low level of understanding of ADB\u2019s procedures for disbursement of funds,\nand (v) unclear or complicated subproject selection criteria and approval procedures.\n42. The design of this Project reflects these lessons. An associated TA on strategic planning\nstudy for preparing the Yellow River law will assist the Government in setting out principles and\nprocedures for integrated river basin management, including watershed management, in the\nYellow River. The Project gives particular attention to subproject selection criteria and approval\nprocedures. YRCC is fully aware of the selection criteria of the subprojects, which were agreed\nupon with ADB and stipulated in the loan agreement. There is little risk of delayed project\nimplementation since YRCC has strong project preparation and implementation capabilities.\nYRCC has a good performance record in implementing several World Bank projects (footnotes\n12-14). However, it has no experience in implementing projects under ADB-financed loans, and\nis  less  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for  (i)  preparation  of  initial  environmental\nexamination/environmental impact assessment (IEE/EIA) for each subproject; (ii) preparation of\nresettlement plans for subprojects if land acquisition and resettlement are required; and (iii)\npreparation of tender documents, evaluation reports, and disbursement documents. To further\nassist YRCC, the Project will give staff in the project management office (PMO) of YRCC on-\nthe-job-training in preparing these documents. International and domestic consultants who are\nfamiliar with ADB procedures will be recruited under the Project.\nE.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n43. ADB\u2019s  strategic  objectives  for  the  PRC  are  to  (i)  improve  economic  efficiency,  (ii)\npromote  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty  in  the  inland  provinces,  and  (iii)  enhance\nenvironmental protection and natural resources management. ADB\u2019s strategic actions in the\nenvironment include (i) building institutional capacity; (ii) improving the policy, legal, regulatory,\nand  management  systems;  (iii)  promoting  cleaner  technologies;  (iv)  supporting  the  use  of\neconomic  measures,  supply-side  measures,  and  other  measures  to  protect  and  ensure\nsustainable use of natural resources; and (v) promoting environmentally sustainable agricultural\nand natural resource management practices. The Project will address both ADB\u2019s strategic and\nenvironmental objectives in the water sector.\n                                                \n16Sector Synthesis of Postevaluation Findings in the Irrigation and Rural Development, May 1995.", "11\n44. In line with ADB\u2019s water policy,17 the Project focuses on the need for an integrated water\nresources management approach. The policy emphasizes that water is a socially vital economic\ngood that needs careful management to sustain equitable economic growth and reduce poverty.\nConserving and protecting water resources through a participatory approach and following\nprinciples of integrated water resources management are at the heart of the policy.\n45. Sector capacities require strengthening in a variety of ways. The policy environment, the\nsector institutions, and the development of human resources working in the sector__all need\nupgrading.  The  public,  the  private  sectors,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and\ncommunity organizations active in the sector need help with institutional development and\nanalysis, water policy formulation, legislation, water resource planning, real-time management\nof  basin  operations,  data  management  and  interpretation,  simulation  modeling  and  other\nanalytical techniques, socioeconomic analysis and skills, community skills, and monitoring and\nevaluation (M&E). ADB will help determine priorities in capacity building and selectively assist\nits partners through a process of monitoring, training, research, and feedback. Good practices\nwill be combined and agencies encouraged to adopt systems of incentives that create the\ndemand for improved capacity.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n1.  Comprehensive Basin Management\n46. Effective water policy planning and implementation involve many institutions. The Project\nwill  focus  on  developing  effective  cross-sector  coordination  mechanisms.  During  project\nprocessing,  the  need  to  strengthen  the  legal  framework  governing  the  Yellow  River  was\nstressed. It was agreed that ADB would support the review and revision of water legislation,\nparticularly in the areas of water rights and allocation among competing uses, water quality\nstandards,  groundwater  use,  demand  management,  resource  conservation,  private  sector\nparticipation, and institutional responsibilities for water sector functions at national, regional, or\nbasin, local, and community levels.\n47. ADB helped to promote the holistic approach to water resources management under the\nTA for strategic options for the water sector (footnote 8). One of the recommendations of the\nstudy  was  to  establish  a  national  water  resources  coordinating  committee  to  direct  and\nsupervise new initiatives in the water sector, including comprehensive basin management. The\nGovernment  intends  to  establish  a  water  resource  management  committee,  which  was\nendorsed during an NPC conference in March 2001.\n48. Recognizing the importance of coordinating activities based on hydrological boundaries\nand those based on administrative boundaries, in December 1997 and October 1999, NPC\nrecommended that the State Council prepare a Yellow River law for basinwide, integrated water\nresources  management  of  the  Yellow  River,  to  deal  with  issues  of  scarcity  of  water  and\novercommitment of available water resources, flood hazards, soil erosion, and serious pollution.\nConsidering the urgency, the State Council placed very high priority for the establishment of the\nYellow River law on its legislative agenda, after the amendments of the 1988 water law.\n49. An associated TA__Strategic Planning Study for the Preparation of the Yellow River\nLaw__will help the Government to analyze the physical, socioeconomic, and legal issues and\nimpediments in enacting the Yellow River law. The study will assist in resolving (i) coordination\n                                                \n17 R230-00: Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank, 16 January 2001.", "12\nof local laws and regulations, which are currently enforced only within the jurisdiction of riparian\nprovinces, townships, and villages;  (ii) conflict between water users in sectors and jurisdictions;\nand (iii) overlapping responsibilities between riparian local governments and the river basin\ncommission.\n2.  Cost Recovery Mechanisms\n50. The PRC policy to levy a fee for the privilege of diverting water__surface water and\nground water__for consumptive and other specified uses is separate and in addition to the policy\nto charge for all water-related services. The decision to levy the fee and its specific use is left to\nthe province and, where assessed, is usually collected by the county Department of Water\nResources (for rural users) and county Department of Construction (for urban users) to be\nshared with governments at other levels. In many instances, several agencies seek to be\nallowed to collect the fees. The Water Law states that the fee may be used only for improving\nwater management.\n51. Water prices at present reflect mainly variable costs and fail to provide for recovery of\nfixed investments. Starting with new projects, MWR has recommended raising water prices to\nencourage efficiency. MWR anticipates the new pricing system will promote water conservation,\nstimulate greater private sector participation in water supply, and reduce future water shortages.\nIrrigation water, about 70 percent of total water use, faces a threefold price increase, while\nurban and industrial water prices also will rise. Low prices stifle investment in water supply and\ntreatment facilities.\n52. Over  the  last  decade,  the  Government  has  increased  the  budget  to  improve  and\nstrengthen the flood protection facilities in the major river basins, almost 15 times more in 1999\nthan in 1990. Investment for flood protection is expected to be further increased under the 10th\nFYP.  Embankments  will  be  improved  and  strengthened  for  effective  flood  protection  and\nminimal flood damage. At the same time, operation and maintenance (O&M) costs will be\nincreased to ensure the financial and physical sustainability of the embankments.\n53. Because of budgetary constraints faced by central and local governments, growing fiscal\nconcerns,18 and the large increases in flood protection investments, the Government has seen\nthe need to recover costs, particularly for O&M, from beneficiaries in all major river basins,\nincluding the Yellow River. In the other major basins__the Yangtze and Songhua__provincial\ngovernments have been levying and collecting fees for O&M of the river infrastructure. The\nWater  Law  (1988),  to  be  amended  shortly,  is  likely  to  stipulate  a  standard  cost-recovery\nmechanism  based  on  the  charges  to  be  collected  from  water  users  and/or  levied  on\nbeneficiaries. Increased tariffs will provide market-based incentives to conserve and recycle\nwater and put a scarce resource to the most productive use.\n54. The associated TA will assist in developing appropriate mechanisms for collecting water\ncharges to cover O&M costs of the flood control facilities. Since the amended Water Law will\nstipulate only the principle of the need to recover O&M costs from water users and beneficiaries,\ndeveloping and implementing the actual mechanism will be left to the provincial governments\nand river basin commissions. The TA will address this issue by analyzing best international\npractices and will provide inputs in formulating implementation regulations under the proposed\nYellow River Law.\n                                                \n18CER:PRC 2000-09: Country Economic Review, People's Republic of China, October 2000, paras. 22-26.", "13\n3.  Strengthening  the  Legal  and  Regulatory  Framework  for  Environmental\nManagement\n55. Environmental management, including planning for conservation of natural resources\nand protection of water resources, is a recent concern in the PRC. To help build the necessary\ncapacity to strengthen the legal framework, ADB (i) helped train the staff of the Environmental\nProtection  Commission  of  NPC  and  is  assisting  in  drafting  and  revising  some  of  PRC's\nenvironmental laws,19 (ii) is helping to promote a more effective legal/regulatory framework for\nenvironmental protection that is responsive to PRC's transition to a market economy and its\nadherence to international environmental protection agreements, (iii) is helping to draft the 1996\namendments to PRC's Water Pollution Law and Environmental Protection Law and assess the\nprovincial water pollution law in Sichuan, and (iv) is also helping to develop a legal information\nsystem  to  support  the  drafting  of  environmental  laws  by  the  Environment  Protection\nCommission  and  other  activities.  The  Environmental  Protection  Law  will  strengthen\nenvironmental protection in the PRC through improved administrative practices, regulations, and\nprovision of future legislation.\n56. A key area in ADB's policy agenda in the PRC is addressing the problem of trans-\nboundary pollution.20 ADB is helping to strengthen institutions and address transjurisdictional\nenvironmental  management  issues,  with  emphasis  on  pollution  in  the  Yellow  River.  The\nexperience  and  output  of  the  Yellow  River  case  study  will  be  used  to  strengthen  the\ntransjurisdictional environmental management system in the six other major river systems as\nwell as minor river systems affecting two or more provinces.\n4.  Livelihood Restoration After Resettlement\n57. For the sector loan subprojects, a suitable policy and legal framework is required for land\nacquisition and resettlement, as necessary, to ensure that affected people will reach or surpass\ntheir  previous  living  standards  as  early  as  possible.  The  1998  Land  Administration  Law21\nspecifies that regulations for large or medium-size water conservation and hydroelectric projects\nwill  be  prescribed  separately  by  the  State  Council.    MWR  is  currently  revising  the  1991\nRegulations  for  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  for  Large  and  Medium  Water  and\nHydropower  Project  Construction  to  enhance  planning,  income  restoration,  monitoring,\nsupervision,  and  redress  of  grievance  among  project  sponsors,  and  the  state  and  local\ngovernments.22 The revised regulations also take account of higher compensation standards\nintroduced under the 1998 Land Administration Law, and enhanced provisions under that Law\nfor planning, consultation, and supervision.  Pending approval of the new MWR Regulations,\n                                                \n19TA 2090-PRC: Legislative Planning and Procedures for the Protection of the Environment, for $393,000, approved\non 26 April 1994; TA 2735-PRC: Capacity Building for Natural Resources Legislation, for $800,000, approved on\n24 December 1996; and TA 3123-PRC: Provincial Legislation on Environmental Protection and Natural Resources,\nfor $300,000, financed by the Norway Government Fund, approved on 15 December 1998.\n20TA 3588-PRC: Transjurisdiction Environment Management (TA cluster), for $2,100,000, approved on 11 December\n2000.\n21 ADB provided assistance to redraft the Land Administration Law, which strengthened the legal framework for\nresettlement  compensation  under  TA  2735-PRC:  Capacity Building for Natural Resources Legislation,  for\n$800,000, approved on 24 December 1996.\n22 ADB staff have participated in the ongoing consultations on the revised MWR regulations, for example, at an\ninternational workshop requested by MWR on Reservoir Resettlement: Policy and Practice at the World Bank in\nWashington D.C. in April 2000.  The new draft regulations consider the resettlement needs of resource poor\nfarmers affected, and may include measures to speed up the process of income restoration following land\nacquisition, to raise compensation standards, and to share in the benefits of project-generated revenue streams\nsuch as power generation.", "14\nSDPC has confirmed that the compensation rates set forth in the 1998 Land Administration Law\nwill apply to all project-related land acquisition and resettlement. In addition, due to the specific\nconditions in the project area__fragile ecological conditions and the risk of both drought and\nflooding,  especially  in  the  inner  floodplain__particular  attention  will  be  given  to  developing\nlivelihood replacement programs as part of resettlement planning and management.\n58. Site  surveys  and  stakeholder  consultations  confirm  that  timely  income  restoration\nfollowing  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  poses  a  significant  challenge  in  river  basin\ninfrastructure projects. Scope exists for intra- and inter-agency dialogue to support the revised\nregulations  by  strengthening  the  application  of  appropriate  legislation  and  compensation\nstandards,  and  by  developing  participatory  planning  processes,  appropriate  production\ntechniques and training, poverty reduction support mechanisms, and accessible credit lines.\nThe Project will support specialized research and its presentation through an annual meeting,\nfield visits, and associated publications. Domestic and international consultants will work with\nthe Environment and Social Division (ESD) established in the PMO in YRCC to develop and\ndocument initial subproject livelihood restoration activities for presentation in the annual forum.\nThe findings of these research activities will provide relevant case study material to guide policy\napplication to river-based resettlement throughout the PRC.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n59. Frequent flooding causes poverty and human suffering and is a major constraint to\nsocioeconomic development in the Yellow River basin. The lower reaches of the Yellow River\nare the worst affected. Although floods have been contained within certain limits, effective flood\nmanagement  and  soil  erosion  control  have  not  been  achieved.  Because  of  increasing\npopulation and corresponding economic activities in flood-prone areas, the economic damage\ncaused  by  flooding  is  increasing.  There  is  a  need  to  shift  from  flood  control  to  flood\nmanagement through  an  integrated  land  and  water  resources  management  approach  that\nincludes soil conservation in the upper catchment, optimal water management throughout the\nbasin, flood control measures, and complementary flood forecasting and warning systems in the\nlower reaches.\n60. The embankments and river training works at several vulnerable points along the Yellow\nRiver need major repair and maintenance. The embankments around flood retention basins\nneed strengthening to reduce the risk of failure. Establishing a morphological prediction system\nalong the lower reach including the estuary will allow sustainable flood management. To give a\nhigher  level  of  security  to  vulnerable  people,  old  infrastructure  (roads,  bridges,  platforms,\ntemporary shelters, etc.) must be upgraded and new ones constructed on the floodplain and in\nretention basins.\n61. The Government\u2019s 10th FYP for the Yellow River and MWR\u2019s Program for 2010 for the\nYellow River give the strategic direction in implementing flood management works in the basin\n(para. 29). The Executing Agency, MWR, and the Implementing Agency, YRCC, are well-\nestablished and experienced in the flood control sector and have the necessary capability to\nimplement the proposed Project. Many relatively small-scale subprojects are dispersed over 800\nkm and will be developed in stages. ADB\u2019s sector loan modality is appropriate for a project that\ncomprises a few core subprojects and about 30 subprojects to be identified and appraised in the\ncourse  of  implementation.  The  sector  loan  approach  will  provide  necessary  flexibility  in", "15\npreparing  and  implementing  subprojects  in  a  phased  manner,  consistent  with  the  local\nimplementation capacity.\nB.  Objective and Scope\n62. The Project aims to reduce the incidence and damage of flooding in the lower Yellow\nRiver basin through improved flood management. The Project will also help to enhance the\nenvironment and protect the poor and near-poor by strengthening/improving protection against\nfloods that could push them further into poverty through the loss of crops, incomes, and assets.\n63. The project area23 is the lower reach of the Yellow River from downstream of Xiaolangdi\nDam to the Bohai Sea, a distance of some 800 km. It covers 3,956 km2 where 1.731 million\npeople  live  in  2,071  villages    (Map  2).    The  area  includes  the  inner  floodplain,  the  main\nembankments and the adjacent land in the outer floodplain. This area, including parts of the Hai\nand Huai river basins, is part of the 117,900 km2 in the Northern Plain vulnerable to flooding\nfrom the Yellow River.\n64. While preparing the 10th FYP for the Yellow River, YRCC also prepared prefeasibility\nreports for subprojects in the project area. Considering these reports, ADB and YRCC agreed\non the priority of certain project components. As recommended in the study on strategic options\nfor  the  water  sector  (footnote  8),  the  importance  of  nonstructural  measures  for  flood\nmanagement was duly recognized. Source control and watershed management measures are\ncentered on holistic river basin management planning presenting an integrated approach, with\nfull attention to environmental issues. The following are the four project components: (i) flood\nmanagement measures, (ii) flood control works, (iii) village flood protection, and (iv) project\nmanagement.\n1.  Flood Management Measures\n65. Considering the importance of nonstructural measures for flood control in the river basin,\nthe  Project  will  strengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  YRCC  to  facilitate  preparation  and\nimplementation  of  an  integrated  approach  in  managing  the  Yellow  River  basin.  The\nnonstructural measures to be developed under the Project follow:\n(i)  a  flood  forecasting  and  warning  system  for  the  lower  reach,  including  the\noperation of the four upstream reservoirs and the retention basin, and floodplain\nzoning;\n(ii)  operational analysis of sedimentation and flushing of the Xiaolangdi Dam, and\nthe morphological development in the lower reach;\n(iii)  an asset management system comprising inventory, condition rating, capacity\navailability,  priority  ranking,  and  maintenance  strategies;  and  a  programmed\nmaintenance schedule for the embankment, protection works, and platforms;\n(iv)  upgraded survey equipment to provide detailed data on water flow and depth,\naimed at two-dimensional river and reservoir modeling;\n(v)  physical and mathematical modeling and field testing of various flood protection\nstructures and river training works;\n                                                \n23Due to the nature of the suspended river, the project area is smaller than the benefit area. The project benefit area\ntotals 113 counties covering 117,900 km2 with an estimated population of 85 million, although topographic features\nobviously ensure that not all areas are directly or equally affected by flood damage. The high-risk flood area\ncomprises 78 counties in Henan, Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces.", "16\n(vi)  flood control command center in Shandong province;\n(vii)  institutional  building  within  YRCC,  primarily  on  integrated  river  basin\nmanagement;\n(viii)  training YRCC staff to strengthen their social and environmental capability; and\n(ix)  providing equipment to flood rescue teams.\n2.  Flood Control Works\n66. Embankments of the lower reach are essential structures for containing the Yellow\nRiver.  The river in flood is a dangerous water body 800 km long and up to 20 km wide, held\nbehind embankments up to 14 m above the surrounding land level. Only the embankments\nprevent the floodwaters from inundating vast areas of valuable land.  The body of floodwater is\npowerful and turbulent, and aggressively attacks the embankments in ways that are difficult to\npredict. Major investments have been made in enclosing the area with a high flood embankment\nand in flooding and drainage sluices. Many structural problems within the existing embankments\nhave accumulated over time: (i) non-homogeneous soil, (ii) joints between construction layers,\n(iii) lack of proper compaction, (iv) historical breaches and avulsions leaving weak foundations,\n(v) emergency repairs carried out with materials immediately available, and (vi) wild animal dens\nand burrows.\n67. Flood control works will involve (i) strengthening the existing embankment including\nconstructing cutoff walls24 in the embankment, (ii) river training, (iii) strengthening the role of\nretention  reservoirs,  and  (iv)  planting  trees  along  the  embankment.  About  120  km  of\nembankment will be strengthened, about 25 km of river training works will be implemented, and\nsix vulnerable spots of the embankment will be reconstructed. Considering the location, scale of\nworks, accessibility, and urgency, the embankment at Kaifeng and Dongping flood retention\nbasin  were  selected  as  two  core  subprojects  representative  of  subprojects  under  this\ncomponent (Appendix 3).\n3.  Village Flood Protection\n68. To meet normal flood safety standard, elevated earth platforms within a few meters of\nthe existing villages will be constructed using compacted riverbed material. Main and secondary\nevacuation  roads  will  be  constructed  or  upgraded,  and  bridges  will  be  rehabilitated.    The\ndrainage system will be improved to minimize waterlogging in the area. Trees and grasses will\nbe planted to stabilize and protect the newly built platform slope.\n69. YRCC, in coordination with the respective local governments, will design and implement\nraising of the village platform. Intensive public consultation between the local governments and\nvillagers who will occupy the newly constructed platform will be conducted. Public infrastructure-\nrelated activities, such as water supply pipes, installation of electricity lines, and relocation of\nschools and clinics and village offices, will be the responsibility of both the township government\nand  the  county  government  concerned,  which  will  bear  the  financial  burden  between\nthemselves. As a result of the Mission\u2019s policy dialogue, the costs of relocation and resettlement\nand for construction of new houses on the adjacent platform for the poor25 will be borne by the\nlocal government concerned; these costs will be above and beyond the compensation that is\n                                                \n24 Impervious underground walls of concrete grout, meant to prevent lateral seepage.\n25Poor households will include the extremely poor households who are already identified in each village. These\ntypically comprise those who are handicapped, infirm, and/or elderly without children.", "17\ndue the poor based on the agreed-upon compensation rates for house relocation.26 The local\ngovernments have agreed to construct all public infrastructure and the houses for the extremely\npoor within two years after construction of the new platform. Considering the location, scale of\nworks, accessibility, and urgent necessity, construction of the village platform in Changyuan was\nselected as a core subproject representative of this component (Appendix 3).\n4.  Project Management\n70.  A PMO, consisting of three divisions,27 has already been established in YRCC to\nimplement subprojects; liaise with local governments; prepare IEEs, resettlement plans, detailed\ndesign, and tender documents; provide technical support to the construction site offices; and\nprepare progress reports. Two project implementation offices, one in Shandong Province and\nthe other in Henan Province, will be established for day-to-day supervision of construction and\nliaison with the provincial governments.\n71. The social and environmental functions of the PMO will be strengthened, particularly\nwith respect to the preparation of IEEs and resettlement plans for the subprojects. ESD will\nsignificantly contribute to the quality of subproject design and implementation, which will justify\nits becoming a permanent entity within YRCC. The issues in which ESD will be involved will\nhelp YRCC shift from a purely engineering approach to an integrated engineering, environment,\nand social approach to flood management.\nC.  Cost Estimates\n72. The total project cost is estimated at $404.7 million equivalent, comprising $150.27\nmillion  in  foreign  exchange  (37  percent)  and  $254.43  million  equivalent  in  local  currency\nincluding taxes and duties. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 1 and detailed in\nAppendix 4. The estimates were derived from prices and base costs as of December 2000. The\ncosts include the front-end fee and interest during construction (IDC) and commitment charges\nestimated at $24.1 million.\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local\nItem Exchange Currency Total Cost\nA.

Each division is headed by a qualified chief supported by at least two subdivision heads.", "18\nD.  Financing Plan\n73. The PRC has requested a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to\nhelp finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years,\nan  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0 percent (the fee will be\ncapitalized in the Loan), conversion options that may be exercised in accordance with the terms\nof the draft Loan Agreement, the Loan Regulations, and ADB\u2019s Conversion Guidelines, and\nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements. The\nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for PRC\u2019s decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s\nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking\nthat these choices were the PRC\u2019s own independent decision and not made in reliance on any\ncommunication or advice of ADB. In addition, the Government of Denmark has agreed to make\navailable untied grant funds amounting to about $300,000 equivalent, to be administered by\nADB, to finance the costs of a team of international consultants for the flood forecasting and\nwarning system.  Local currency costs are to be financed by the Government ($224.3 million),\nand local governments and beneficiaries ($30.1 million). Cost sharing among YRCC, local\ngovernments,  and  beneficiaries  will  be  agreed  upon  by  these  parties  before  platform\nsubprojects are implemented.28 The financing plan is summarized in Table 2 and detailed in\nAppendix 4.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percent\nAsian Development Bank 150.00 0.00 150.00 37.1\nDanish Government 0.27 0.03 0.30 0.1\nCentral Government 0.00 224.30 224.30 55.4\nLocal Governments\n  and Beneficiaries 0.00 30.10 30.10 7.4\nTotal 150.27 254.43 404.70 100.0\nSource: ADB estimates.\n74. The proceeds of ADB\u2019s loan will be channeled to YRCC, through MWR, as an annual\nbudgetary allocation. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will make counterpart fund allocations to\nMWR for the Project on a grant basis. This is the first ADB loan for which MOF has committed\nto  finance  all  the  counterpart  fund  requirements  except  for  the  village  flood  protection\ncomponent. The provincial and local governments concerned will help finance the village flood\nprotection component from their own budgetary resources. The proposed project fund flows are\ndetailed in Appendix 5.\nE.  Executing and Implementing Agencies\n75.  MWR will be the Executing Agency of the Project and YRCC will be responsible for\nimplementation.  The  village  flood  protection  component  will  be  implemented  by  YRCC  in\ncooperation with the local government agency concerned and with beneficiary participation.\n                                                \n28A written commitment from the village and township governments for the Changyuan core subproject has been\nsubmitted to YRCC. Similar arrangements will be made for all other candidate subprojects.", "19\n76. MWR is responsible for developing and formulating medium- to long-term policies and\nplanning, drafting of legislation; supervising law enforcement, unified management of water\nresources,  comprehensive  basin  planning;  organizing  water  extraction,  permit,  and  fee\ncollection systems; flood control and drought management; and review of feasibility studies for\nlarge and medium-size water projects. MWR is linked vertically to water resource departments\nin each of the provinces, which have comparable responsibility to MWR at the provincial level.\nMWR has well-qualified planning and engineering staff and has a track record of managing a\nvariety of complex water sector projects (footnotes 12 and 13). These projects have been\ntechnically well-planned and implemented.\n77. Reflecting the importance of water resources, the central Government\u2019s annual budget\nallocated to MWR for water management projects increased from Y2 billion in 1990 to Y13\nbillion in 1997, and then to around Y30 billion level from 1998 to 2000. Because floods cause\nsevere damage to people's lives and the national economy, almost 80 percent of the total\ncentral Government budget for the sector has been allocated to flood control projects since\n1998.\n78. YRCC was established in 1933 as one of seven interprovincial river basin commissions\nunder  the  direct  administration  of  MWR.  The  State  Council  in  1994  made  YRCC  solely\nresponsible for river management in the Yellow River basin. YRCC also assumed responsibility\nfor the Xinjiang inland river basin and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Reflecting its\nstrong engineering capabilities, YRCC was an implementing agency in the construction of large\nreservoirs in the Yellow River basin, such as Sanmenxia dam and Xiaolangdi dam.\n79. YRCC regulates the abstraction of water from the main stream and tributaries across\nprovinces. It controls the total volume of water diverted by the provinces along the Yellow River\nin accordance with the water allocation scheme approved by the State Council. Following water\ndistribution  management  rules,  YRCC  coordinates  the  operations  of  Liujiaxia,  Wanjiazhai,\nSanmenxia,  and  Xiaolangdi  reservoirs  on  the  main  stream,  and  the  Guxian  and  Luhun\nreservoirs, and Dongping flood retention basin on the tributaries (Map 1). YRCC issues monthly\nand 10-day water distribution plans as well as water distribution for emergency allocations.\n80. YRCC employs 30,000 people: 9,120 are professionals of whom 3,580 are engineers\nand 715 are senior engineers.  Many of the engineers were involved in constructing large dams\nsuch as Xiaolangdi dam and Sanmenxia dam on the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow\nRiver. The Reservoir Resettlement Division has 39 people who have experience in resettling\nabout 200,000 people from the Xiaolangdi reservoir site, and trained under technical assistance\nfrom the World Bank. YRCC has an extensive network of offices in the Yellow River basin for\nO&M  of  embankment  and  flood  control  facilities.  In  the  lower  reaches  alone,  there  are  2\nprovincial river affairs bureaus, 2 project bureaus, 13 regional or city river affairs bureaus, 52\ncounty or district river affairs bureaus, 13 gate management stations, and 4 flood retarding\noffices.\n81. The local governments, including the county and township project leading groups and\nthe working groups,29 will carry out some resettlement activities, such as public consultation,\n                                                \n29 Proposed membership of the county leading group comprises the relevant deputy county magistrate and one\nsenior staff member from the bureaus of River Management, Land Management, Agriculture, Civil Affairs/Poverty\nAlleviation, Education and Women\u2019s Federation. The township leading group members comprise local senior staff\nfrom the township government, civil affairs, women\u2019s federation, agricultural technical station, urban construction,\nand river management agencies.", "20\nM&E, and complaint management. The capacity of local governments to fulfill these activities\nwill be further strengthened through training and consulting inputs (paras. 90 and 96).\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Coordination\n82. A project steering committee (PSC) at the national level was established to coordinate\nall key policy aspects relating to project implementation, monitoring, and advice to the PMO.\nThe PSC will be convened every six months if necessary. It will be chaired by a vice minister of\nMWR and comprise representatives from MOF, SDPC, MWR, State Environmental Protection\nAgency  (SEPA),  Henan  and  Shandong  provincial  governments,  and  other  relevant\nministries/agencies. A secretariat of the PSC will be established within MWR.\n2.  Selection and Preparation of Subprojects\n83. MWR,  in  coordination  with  YRCC,  will  identify  and  prioritize  subprojects  to  be\nimplemented, subject to the availability of ADB loan proceeds. Priority will be to subprojects that\n(i) benefit a large number of flood-vulnerable residents, (ii) are located in areas with poverty\nincidence  higher  than  the  average  for  the  project  area,  (iii)  have  no  major  negative\nenvironmental  impact,  and  (iv)  involve  no  or  minimal  land  acquisition  or  involuntary\nresettlement. YRCC will prepare the feasibility study for each prioritized subproject, including\nthe IEEs and resettlement plan as stipulated in ADB\u2019s guidelines, and submit it to ADB for\nreview and approval. A list of candidate subprojects is in Appendix 6.\n84. The following criteria will be applied in selecting the candidate subprojects:\n(i)  The economic internal rate of return of the subproject will not be less than 12\npercent.\n(ii)  The subproject will not adversely affect areas designated as nature reserves,\nwetland sanctuaries, or other environmentally protected areas.\n(iii)  An IEE/EIA will have been prepared for the subproject in accordance with the\nrelevant PRC laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines,30 and\nwill have been approved by SEPA and ADB.\n(iv)  Subprojects under the village flood protection component and flood control works\nthat will require a resettlement plan will promote gender equity31 and satisfy the\ngender checklist requirements.\n(v)  For  a  subproject  under  the  village  flood  protection  component,  the  local\ngovernment will have submitted written confirmation acceptable to ADB that all\nhouseholds to be moved because of the subproject are resettling voluntarily.\n(vi)  For a subproject under the village flood protection component, the cost sharing\narrangements among YRCC, the local governments, and the beneficiaries will be\nset forth in the feasibility study.  The local governments will also have provided\nassurances that they have sufficient financing for the public facilities and utilities,\npermanent and temporary acquisition of farmland, compensation for relocation of\n                                                \n30The guidelines are in the Environmental Assessment Requirements of the Asian Development Bank, March 1998.\n31ADB recognizes in its gender and development policy that all projects have a gender impact and do not\nautomatically benefit men and women equally. During the design phase, the Government will carry out gender\nanalysis to ensure all subprojects under the village flood protection component and flood control works that require\na resettlement plan provide equal opportunities for men and women to be involved and to benefit.", "21\ndwellings, and restoration of the old platform to farmland or other agricultural\nuses.\n(vii)  Any social cost will be minimized through equitable contribution of financial and\nresource provisions between governments and communities.\n(viii)  For a subproject under the flood control works component, negative effects, if\nany, due to land acquisition and involuntary resettlement will be identified and\nmitigated in accordance with ADB's policy on involuntary resettlement and the\nsector lending arrangements set forth in Appendix 7. If a resettlement plan is\nrequired,  that  plan  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  PRC  laws  and\nregulations and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement, and will be subject to\napproval by ADB.\n(ix)  For a subproject involving one or more poor areas (as designated by the national\nand provincial/local governments), the feasibility study will include a description\nof the poverty programs in that county or counties, the ways by which the poor\nunder the proposed subproject will benefit from such programs, and an M&E plan\nto ensure that poverty impact analysis will be conducted in accordance with ADB\nguidelines.32\n3.  Implementation Schedule\n85. The Project will be implemented over four years (Appendix 8) beginning in September\n2001, with completion by end-2005. To accelerate project implementation (para. 94), YRCC has\nstarted the following preparatory activities:\n(i)  select priority subprojects for implementation in 2001;\n(ii)  prepare feasibility studies plus required IEEs and resettlement plans for priority\nsubprojects;\n(iii)  conduct surveys, investigations, and prepare detailed designs, cost estimates,\nand tender documents; and\n(iv)  prepare tender process for awarding contracts for works in 2001.\n4.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n86. A summary resettlement plan prepared for three core subprojects was circulated to the\nBoard  on  2  February  2001,  together  with  summary  IEEs  (SIEEs).  MWR  has  overall\nresponsibility for acquiring land and resettling people for the Project, working through YRCC and\nthe provincial governments of Henan and Shandong. The IEE and resettlement plans have\nbeen  disclosed  to  the  public.  The  resettlement  plan  prepared  for  each  of  the  three  core\nsubprojects, as a model consistent with ADB's guidelines, will be used as a basis for preparing\nthe resettlement plans for future subprojects. For future subprojects, any land acquisition and\nresettlement effects will be addressed, and full or short resettlement plans will be prepared as\nappropriate to the magnitude of impact, following the resettlement policy framework and the\nresettlement procedural guidelines set out under the resettlement sector lending arrangements\nin Appendix 7.\n87. Resettlement  plans  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  relevant  laws  and\nregulations, including the Land Administration Law of 1998, and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary\nresettlement. All persons affected by land acquisition for the subprojects will be compensated in\na timely manner and resettled in accordance with the resettlement plan so that they will be at\n                                                \n32 ADB\u2019s Handbook on Social and Poverty Impact Analysis (draft under review in ADB).", "22\nleast as well off as they would have been in the absence of the subprojects. MWR/YRCC will\nengage  an  independent,  qualified  agency  acceptable  to  ADB  to  monitor  resettlement\nentitlements,  prepare  semiannual  reports  during  project  implementation,  and  evaluate  and\nreport  on  the  achievement  of  resettlement  objectives  at  project  completion  and  one  year\nthereafter.\n88. Compensation for land acquisition is payable to village committees, and the specific\nrates will be those of the 1998 Land Administration Law.33 This sets the land compensation\ncomponent at 6-10 times the average annual output value over the past three years, and the\nresettlement subsidy is 4-6 times that value. Within this range, the specific entitlements are\nbeing finalized.\n89. The 1998 Land Administration Law provides for disclosure and consultation with the\naffected people. YRCC agreed to ensure that copies of the resettlement plan, in the Chinese\nlanguage, are placed in the township offices for perusal by the affected people. The temporary\nresettlement offices and township governments are responsible for receiving the comments of\nthe affected people and addressing their concerns. There will be intensive consultation with all\naffected people during asset inventory and valuation at the household level.  MWR will ensure\nthat written agreements are signed with each affected collective, household, and enterprise\nbefore construction begins.\n5.  Training Program\n90. Training will be conducted for about 400 staff members of YRCC and selected local\ngovernment  officials  involved  in  implementing  resettlement,  environmental  aspects,  and\neconomic evaluation of the candidate subprojects. To provide targeted training inputs and in\nconsultation with the international consultants, national institutions with specific expertise in\nthese areas will be selected and engaged in accordance with selection criteria and procedures\nacceptable to ADB.\n91. Implementing the nonstructural measures for flood management involves research and\ndevelopment in the methodology and adoption of new technologies tested elsewhere. Essential\nto the activities are well-trained groups of people at YRCC. International and domestic experts\nwill be required to set up the flood forecasting and warning system and the morphological\nmodeling  systems,  deploy  advanced  survey  equipment,  establish  ESD,  and  transfer  the\ntechnology to YRCC staff. Technology transfer will be achieved by a combination of on-the-job\ntraining and specialized training courses conducted overseas and in the country.\n92. Training in resettlement will be offered to members of the county and township project\nleading  groups  and  working  groups  in  designated  subproject  sites.  The  training  will  cover\napplied aspects of resettlement legislation and compensation, participatory social survey and\nsite  planning  methods,  management  of  resettlement  activities  and  funds,  techniques  for\nrestoring livelihood, and practical M&E techniques. This training will be at standards appropriate\nto the functional responsibilities and interests of participants and based on a simple needs\nassessment process. A qualified domestic consultant will conduct a needs assessment for the\ntraining, involving the YRCC resettlement staff in a learning capacity.  Responsibility for further\ndeveloping and conducting locally appropriate training courses will then pass on to YRCC staff\n                                                \n33Presently MWR is reviewing and processing the revision of the 1991 MWR Guidelines for Implementing Medium to\nLarge Hydropower Project, to reflect recent developments and the recent changes in the Land Administration Law\n(1998).", "23\nwho will offer the training for subsequent approved subprojects.  This may ultimately develop\ninto  a  formal  certification  procedure  for  trainers  in  river-based  resettlement  and  course\ngraduates.\n6.  Procurement\na.  Equipment, Vehicles, and Civil Works\n93. Goods and services for ADB-financed contracts will be procured in accordance with\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement.  Major  contracts  for  equipment  valued  at  more  than\n$500,000 will be undertaken through ADB\u2019s international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures.\nSmaller equipment packages, of $500,000 or less each, will be procured following international\nshopping procedures. Civil works contracts estimated to cost more than $5 million will be carried\nout using ICB procedures while those of $5 million equivalent or less will be carried out using\nlocal competitive bidding (LCB) procedures in accordance with the tendering and bidding law\nand related regulations.34 Local contractors have the necessary expertise, experience, and\ncapacity  to  undertake  these  contracts.  However,  in  accordance  with  ADB's Guidelines for\nProcurement, foreign contractors may bid on contracts using LCB. Civil works for the village\nflood protection component costing $1 million or less per package will be implemented under\nforce account basis, since it would be difficult for local contractors to implement the component,\nwhich  requires  close  coordination  with  large  numbers  of  villagers.  The  list  of  indicative\nprocurement packages is in Appendix 9.\nb.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing\n94. To start project implementation early, ADB approved advance procurement action,35 up\nto signing of the contracts. ADB also approved in principle retroactive financing in an amount of\nabout $2 million (i) as mobilization payment of $1.7 million for the civil work contractors for the\nthree core subprojects; and (ii) $0.3 million to procure vehicles and office equipment for the\nproject office, from 9 July 2001 to date of effectiveness of the ADB loan. Retroactive financing is\nrequired because the construction period in the area is limited by cold weather in winter and\nhigh river water levels in the summer and construction needs to start in September 2001. For\nthe Kaifeng core subproject, construction noise and activities must be substantially reduced\nfrom October to March to avoid disturbing the seasonal water fowl migration in the Liuyuankou\nNature Reserve. Hence, a deferment of civil works until the expected loan effectiveness in the\nfourth  quarter  of  2001  would  entail  deferring  the  project  civil  works  by  another  year.  The\nGovernment  requested  ADB  approval  for  advance  action  for  civil  works,  procurement  of\nequipment and vehicles, and selection of consultant firms for the flood management component.\nAdvance recruitment of consultants will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants,\nand advance procurement action will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\nThe Government has been advised that ADB's concurrence on advance action and retroactive\nfinancing does not constitute ADB commitment to finance the relevant expenditures under the\nProject or the Project itself.\n                                                \n34The Project will consist of a large number of civil works contracts (mainly earth-related works) located in different\nparts of the project area. It is unlikely that international contractors will be interested in bidding for such contracts.\n35Reported in the March 2001 issue of ADB Business Opportunities.", "24\n7.  Consulting Services\n95. The international consultants, including the consultant to be financed by the Government\nof Denmark, will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants, and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic\nconsultants. The consultants for the engineering study (32 person-months international and 766\ndomestic) will assist YRCC in the areas of flood forecasting and management, morphological\nmodeling,  asset  management  systems,  reservoir  operation,  and  survey  equipment.  The\nconsultants for the project management component (48 person-months international and 384\ndomestic)  will  help  in  monitoring  the  environmental  mitigation  measures,  implementing  the\nresettlement  plan,  and  strengthening  PMO  operations,  particularly  ESD  in  PMO.  The\nGovernment of Denmark will finance a part of the engineering study (10 person-months of an\ninternational consultant) for the flood forecasting and warning system. The Project will require\n80  person-months  of  international  and  1,150  of  domestic  consulting  services  including\nengineering study, project management, environment, and social development (resettlement).\nThe required consulting services are listed in Appendix 10.\n96. The international consultants will also work with YRCC to develop methods of social\nanalysis to select and prepare subprojects, define the social costs and benefits of flood-related\nproblems, select options with minimum social costs, and prepare IEEs and land acquisition and\nresettlement  plans,  with  particular  attention  to  livelihood  restoration  and  methods  for\nenvironmental  and  resettlement  M&E.  Twelve  person-months  each  from  an  international\nenvironment specialist and an international social specialist will be required to work with the\nlocal sociologists and environmental specialists in ESD.  A feature of this work is the use of\nlessons from the ongoing M&E in selecting and preparing future subprojects.\n8.  Imprest Account and Statement of Expenditures\n97. MOF will establish an imprest fund account for the Project in a commercial bank in\nBeijing to ensure that an adequate amount of the loan proceeds is available on a timely basis.\nThe imprest account will cover disbursement related to the Project, to a ceiling of 10 percent of\nthe total loan amount. The account will be operated and maintained in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nLoan Disbursement Handbook (January  2001),  as  amended  from  time  to  time,  and  the\nenhanced statement of expenditure procedures for ADB loans.\n9.  Report, Accounts, and Audit\n98. YRCC  will  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  indicating  progress  made,  problems\nencountered during the period under review, steps taken or proposed to remedy the problems,\nthe proposed program of activities, and the expected progress during the following quarter. For\nthe  village  flood  protection  component,  the  local  government  concerned  will  also  prepare\nquarterly progress reports for subproject areas for which it is responsible. Both YRCC and the\nlocal governments will submit their respective progress reports to MWR. Subsequently, MWR\nwill  review  and  submit  the  progress  report  to  ADB.  In  addition  to  periodic  reporting  and\nmonitoring, ADB and the Government will jointly review project implementation at least once a\nyear to identify and resolve major issues.\n99.  Within six months of physical completion of the Project, MWR will submit to ADB a\ncompletion report that describes subproject selection and design, implementation, actual costs\nincurred in relation to cost estimates, benefits, beneficiary consultations, and other information\nrequested by ADB.", "25\n100. MWR will maintain separate records and accounts sufficient to identify the goods and\nservices  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan,  the  financing  resources  received,  the\nexpenditures  incurred  for  the  Project,  and  the  use  of  local  funds.  The  accounts  will  be\nestablished  and  maintained  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting  principles.  The  annual\nconsolidated project accounts and related financial statements for the Executing Agency will be\naudited  and  translated  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB.36  The  audited  reports  and  related\nfinancial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than nine months after the end of the\nfiscal year to which they relate. The Government was informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of\naudited accounts, which covers failure in submitting audited accounts and financial statements\nwithin the due date. A formal warning will be issued for accounts more than 6 months overdue\nand disbursements will be suspended for accounts that are 12 months overdue.\n10.  Annual and Midterm Review\n101. The Government and ADB will review project implementation annually. In the third year,\nthey will carry out a midterm review of project achievements. The midterm review will critically\nassess the project parameters__including both physical progress as well as progress on the\npolicy  agenda  and  institutional  performance__evaluate  whether  the  Project  will  achieve  the\nintended objectives and benefits, and take appropriate measures including modifying design\nand reallocating resources as necessary.\n11.  Project Monitoring and Evaluation\n102. A set of indicators to estimate the project impact in relation to goals, purposes, outputs,\nand conditions has been agreed upon by ADB and YRCC. The main items include (i) economic\ndevelopment and poverty indicators in the project area; (ii) hydrological and morphological\nindicators such as frequency of flooding in the lower reaches of the Yellow River; (iii) physical\nprogress of the Project; and (iv) social impact indicators, including progress in relocation. YRCC\nwill prepare and maintain records of such information for at least five years after the completion\nof civil works. YRCC will monitor and assess activities, and include the results in the quarterly\nprogress reports to ADB.\n103. Project  monitoring  and  evaluation  (PME)  based  on  the  participatory  rural  appraisal\n(PRA) approach will be undertaken to assess changes in socio-economic conditions in the\nsubproject area. The key PRA quantitative indicators are agricultural and commercial production\npatterns; incomes and expenditure levels; poverty reduction effects though income and social\ncapabilities; access to public and private technical, social services, and utilities; and village\norganization. An international specialist and domestic consultants will work together to advise\nYRCC on appropriate PRA methods and give field training in applying the methods during\nimplementation of relevant project activities. Trainees will include relevant staff from ESD;\nResettlement,  Planning,  and  Design  Sections  of  YRCC;  PMO;  and  staff  from  the  poverty\nalleviation  and  development  offices  at  the  project  sites.  The  aim  of  the  training  and  field\napplication  is  to  ensure  that  relevant  PRA  skills  are  identified,  understood,  adapted,  and\nincorporated into YRCC\u2019s social survey working practice.\n104. Independent resettlement PME will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on\ninvoluntary  resettlement  to  ensure  that  all  persons  affected  by  land  acquisition  for  the\nsubprojects  are  compensated  adequately  and  in  a  timely  manner,  and  are  resettled  in\n                                                \n36 ADB is assisting to strengthen PRC's auditing procedures under TA 3103-PRC: Strengthening the Government\nAuditing System, for $700,000, approved on 26 November 1998.", "26\naccordance with the resettlement plan so that they will be at least as well off as they would have\nbeen  in  the  absence  of  the  subprojects.  YRCC  will  commission  an  independent  domestic\nresearch institution, acceptable to ADB, to undertake this work. Monitoring responsibilities will\ninclude  reviewing  resettlement  entitlements;  and  preparing  annual  reports  during  project\nimplementation,  an  evaluation  report  on  achievement  of  resettlement  objectives  at  project\ncompletion and then one year thereafter. All reports will require fieldwork to collect and verify\ndata,  and  will  describe  the  field  research  methodologies  employed,  and  the  number  and\nproportion of locations and households surveyed.\n12.  Operation and Maintenance\n105. All  facilities  and  structures  constructed  and  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  will  be\noperated and maintained by YRCC during implementation and after completion of the works.\nThe O&M requirement of the structures, estimated at Y36.8 million ($4.4 million) per annum at\n2000 prices, will be given to YRCC through MWR as annual budgetary allocation.  Another Y5.3\nmillion ($0.6 million) will be required for O&M of vehicles and equipment to be procured under\nthe Project. A cost recovery mechanism for O&M of the completed facilities will be further\nstudied through the associated TA (paras. 118-120). The local government concerned will be\nresponsible for O&M of the village facilities from their own resources. ADB may request at any\ntime before and during project implementation copies of approved O&M budgets for works and\nfacilities to be financed under the Project.\n13.  Governance and Anticorruption\n106. During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to the central and\nlocal  governments,  and  YRCC  officials.  Attention  was  drawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and\ncorruption  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  particularly  the  need  for\nbidders/suppliers/contractors  to  observe  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  in  procuring  and\nexecuting ADB-financed contracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered.\nSimilarly, the anticorruption provisions added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\nwere discussed.\n107. The Government is increasingly concerned with governance issues and has conducted\nwell-publicized campaigns against official corruption. The Tendering and Bidding Law stipulates\nthat tender and bidding activities will follow the principles of openness, fairness, impartiality, and\ngood faith (Article 5). This law covers key construction projects funded by the State and all\nexternally funded projects. Article 6 stipulates that \u201cno organizations or persons shall, by any\nmeans, limit or exclude legal persons or other organizations outside from other regions or\nsystems from participating in the bidding procedure. No illegal interference in any form is\npermitted in the bidding process.\u201d Article 32 specifically prohibits bribes and collusion, while\nArticles 49-64 specify appropriate sanctions for all abuses of the law, including substantial fines\nand criminal prosecution. ADB is helping to develop the implementation regulations for the\nTendering and Bidding Law.37\n                                                \n37TA  3457-PRC: Implementation of the Tendering and Bidding Law and Related Regulations,  for  $565,000,\napproved on 14 June 2000.", "27\nG.  Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n108. The Project is in environmental category B. IEEs were prepared for the three core\nsubprojects based on data collected during the feasibility studies, review of related reports, and\nconsultations  with  concerned  government  offices  and  affected  communities.  An  SIEE  was\ncirculated to the Board on 2 February 2001. The IEE concludes that the negative environmental\nimpacts arising from construction and operation of project facilities can be kept at acceptable\nlevels through implementation of mitigation measures that will be monitored by an independent\ninstitution to be recruited under the Project. The IEE stated that EIA was not required for the\nthree core subprojects. The IEE reports (translated into the local language) were made available\nto the public and other interested parties in the Project\u2019s field offices in Shandong and Henan\nprovinces.\n109. The IEEs for the candidate subprojects will be prepared in packages considering the\ngeographic  location,  similarity,  and  timing  of  subprojects  construction.  Approval  for  the\nIEE/EIA38 of each package will be obtained from SEPA and ADB before construction starts. The\nIEEs  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  relevant  Government  environmental  laws  and\nregulations and ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines. During implementation and operation of the\ncore  and  candidate  subprojects,  MWR/YRCC  will  also  comply  with  all  applicable  national,\nprovincial, and local environmental laws and regulations.\n110. The  Project  will  cause  some  negative  as  well  as  positive  environmental  impacts.\nPotential negative environmental impacts include (i) temporary loss of farmland (151.3 ha) to be\nused as borrow pits, temporary access roads, storage for pipelines, and construction sites; and\npermanent acquisition of land (321.5 ha) for the construction of warping39 areas, tree planting\nfor the wave protection belt, new village platforms, and road construction and widening; (ii) use\nof a large volume of groundwater for warping of earth in Kaifeng and Changyuan and its\ndisposal after use; (iii) temporary large contractors' camps, which may cause social tension\namong villagers, water body contamination, and solid waste disposal; (iv) disturbance and illegal\nhunting of migrating waterfowl and wildlife, particularly at the location close to the core area of\nthe Liuyuankou Wetland Nature Reserve; (v) potential erosion of unconsolidated material in\nareas with bare soil such as new embankments, newly warped areas, temporary roads, and\nconstruction  sites;  and  (vi)  use  of  heavy  machinery  and  a  large  number  of  construction-\nassociated vehicles that may cause environmental pollution (emission, used oils, grease, tar,\nand cement) and noise.\n111. The mitigation measures are as follows: (i) affected people will be compensated, and\nincome opportunities created to restore the livelihood of permanently displaced people; (ii)\naround 60 wells will be uniformly spread in each of the subproject areas to minimize the\nlowering of water table, and excess water will be used for irrigation, recycled in the slurry\nprocess during warping, or drained into the Yellow River; (iii) labor camp management will\n                                                \n38The PRC classifies EIAs into three categories: Category I: projects with low or no environmental impacts are\nrequired to prepare EIA table, Category II: projects with moderate impacts are required to prepare EIA form\n(equivalent to ADB\u2019s IEE requirement), and Category III: projects with significant impacts are required to prepare a\nfull EIA. SEPA has classified the Project as Category II. The EIA to be submitted to SEPA will follow Government\nprocedures and format, and the IEE to be submitted to ADB will follow ADB\u2019s IEE guidelines and format, but they\nwill be very similar in content. Both reports will be submitted to SEPA and ADB simultaneously for review.\n39 Extraction of silt-water fluid from the riverbed by suction and pumping of slurry overland to the land side of the\nembankment, where it is deposited and drained, forming a banquette typically 100 m wide.", "28\nprovide guidelines on social aspects to avoid conflict with villagers, employ local community\nmembers as much as possible, raise awareness of the area\u2019s ecological status for the Kaifeng\nsubproject (e.g., strict control of, and penalty for, hunting waterfowl), and solid and liquid wastes\nmanagement at the labor camp; (iv) to prevent waterfowl hunting, the borrow pits near the\nLiuyuankou Wetland Nature Reserve will not be used during the bird migration season; (v) new\nembankments, warped areas, and platform slopes will be provided with reasonably fertile topsoil\nand planted with vegetation cover, and bare areas will be replanted; (vi) machinery will be kept\naway from the Liuyuankou Wetland Nature Reserve, no closer than 1 km from sensitive areas,\nand its nighttime use strictly controlled; (vii) vehicle speed will be limited to a maximum of 30 km\nper hour and temporary roads moistened when necessary to minimize dust; and (viii) safety\nprocedures will be implemented to prevent accidents involving the use of dangerous materials\nand inflammable or corrosive fluids.\n112. The potential positive environmental impacts are as follows: (i) warping wastewater can\nbe used to irrigate farmland in the inner floodplain; (ii) the abandoned borrow pits will become\nartificial  wetlands  of  value  to  wildlife  and  migrating  waterfowl;  and  (iii)  tree  planting  and\nreforestation programs will produce better ground cover, reduce erosion, and generate income.\n113. ESD40 in the PMO will monitor and supervise the implementation of mitigation measures\nfor the environmental and social impacts of the three core subprojects during the construction\nand  operational  stages,  and  apply  this  experience  to  the  other  subprojects.  ESD  will  be\nstrengthened and will have an approved budget to support its staff. An international environment\nspecialist  will  be  recruited  to  assist  in  overall  environmental  management  of  the  core\nsubprojects,  including  incorporation  of  environmental  mitigation  measures  into  the  bidding\ndocuments and contractor\u2019s contract, and advise on preparing the IEE/SIEE of the candidate\nsubprojects and their quality assurance. Overall, ESD will give advice on the environmental\nmanagement of the core and candidate subprojects. In doing so, ESD staff will coordinate with\nSEPA  and  the  environmental  protection  bureaus  in  the  provinces,  prefectures,  cities,  and\ncounties. Environmental monitoring during project construction and operation will (i) ensure that\nconstruction is carried out according to design, and proposed mitigation measures are followed;\n(ii) identify any new or unforeseen environmental problems, and determine how they can be\naddressed and mitigation measures formulated; and (iii) ensure that environmental and social\nimpacts are minimized to acceptable levels.\n114. The key environmental issues in the basin are flooding and water shortages, erosion and\nsedimentation, surface water and groundwater pollution, and decline in biological resources.\nStructural measures to manage flooding and water resources should be complemented with\nlong-term measures. Long-term solutions need to focus on increasing rainfall infiltration and\nwater retention, and achieving acceptable limited flooding in the lower reaches. In practice,\nthese entail increasing the cover of perennial vegetation, especially in mountainous areas,\nlimiting cultivation and expanding terracing in hilly areas, and establishing flood retention areas\nin conjunction with land use planning.\n                                                \n40The ESD will be headed by a division chief, and have environment and social subteams. The environment subteam\nwill  consist  of  two  experts:  one  with  an  ecology-cum-EIA  background,  and  another  with  an  environmental\nengineering background. The social subteam will consist of two experts: one with an economics and poverty\nreduction background, and another with an agriculture and social forestry background. Each subteam will be\nassisted by 2-3 field technical assistants to be located in each subproject.", "29\n2.  Social Analysis\n115. A range of data sources has been utilized and compared to derive statistical overviews\nand a socioeconomic profile of the three subproject sites in the context of a river basin and a\nprovince.  National,  provincial,  and  county/city  yearbooks,  agency  annual  reports,  thematic\nmaps,  and  specialist  reports  provided  an  initial  overview.  These  were  supplemented  with\ncounty-level problem identification activities, agency and local leadership interviews, over 100\nhousehold sample surveys, 27 community PRA processes, gender analysis, separate group\ninterviews  with  men  and  women,  and  two  workshops  to  provide  feedback  and  receive\ncomments from key counterpart institutions. In all public consultations, there was strong support\nfor the Project.\n116. Henan  and  Shandong  provinces  have  relatively  well-developed  provincial  and\nagricultural economies. However, they have some poor areas that are particularly mountainous\nand flood-prone. A significant portion of these areas is within the land protected by the Yellow\nRiver  embankments.  Two  designated  provincial-level  poor  counties  are  in  the  proposed\nsubproject site at Dongping flood retention basin in Shandong. There is also a cluster of poverty\nareas along sections of the Yellow River near subproject sites in neighboring Henan. Poverty in\nthese areas result from a flood-prone and depleted physical environment, loss of assets and\nincome as a result of floods, and unanticipated effects of past resettlement at some sites.\nBecause of the perceived risks of floods, people are unwilling to restore or invest in community\ninfrastructure,  services  and  farm  production  assets  that  might  otherwise  attract  external\nentrepreneurs, or support self-funded development. Low farm product prices and marketing\ndifficulties present additional problems. In this general scenario, household poverty is further\nexacerbated by illness; high household dependency ratios; and lack of labor, job skills, and\nqualifications.\n117. Central, provincial, and local governments have responded to this through a number of\npolicy  measures,  including  development  of  interarea  linkages,  engineering  flood  protection\nmechanisms, land improvement strategies and provision of poverty and relief support. However,\nfunding shortfalls, limited development of stable local income-earning opportunities, associated\ntechnical support and credit availability continue to hamper rapid improvement.\nH.  Technical Assistance\n118. The current legal and institutional framework and arrangements do not allow for uniform\nand effective management of the Yellow River basin. In line with the proposed amendment of\nthe 1988 Water Law, the Government will enact a Yellow River Law to specifically address\nmanagement of the Yellow River water resources through adoption of a unified administration\nclearly defining the rights and responsibilities of each relevant department and local government\nconcerned. In this context, the Government requested ADB to provide a TA in conjunction with\nthe proposed loan to conduct a strategic planning study for preparing the Yellow River Law.\n119. The  TA  will  (i)  review  the  baseline  information  and  data  on  social,  environmental,\neconomic,  and  technical  conditions  of  the  Yellow  River  basin;  (ii)  identify  socioeconomic\ndevelopment opportunities and assess the problems and constraints, giving due attention to the\nspecific characteristics of the river and the diversified nature of the basin area; (iii) review the\nrelevant Government policies and plans as well as current institutional setup for water resources\nmanagement in general, and for the Yellow River in particular; (iv) prepare comprehensive\nstudies  pertaining  to  issues  in  effective  water  resources  management  and  sustainable", "30\nsocioeconomic  development  of  the  Yellow  River  basin;  and  (v)  prepare  policy  and  legal\nrecommendations for the formulation of the Yellow River Law.\n120. About 80 person-months of consulting services will be needed: 17 international and 63\ndomestic. The TA cost is estimated at $1.27 million equivalent, comprising $562,000 in foreign\nexchange costs and $708,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide $970,000\nequivalent on a grant basis, from the ADB-funded TA program, to cover the entire foreign\nexchange cost and part of the local currency cost, equivalent to $408,000. MWR will meet the\nbalance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $300,000 by providing office accommodations,\ncounterpart staff, field surveys, and logistical support. The consultants will be selected and\nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants,  and  other\narrangements for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. The detailed cost\nestimates and terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 11.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Economic Evaluation\n121. Economic analyses were carried out for the three core subprojects to evaluate the\nreturns on project investments to the economy (Appendix 12). The economic life of the project\nstructures is 40 years, including the construction period. A shadow exchange rate factor of 1.07\nwas applied to derive the economic cost and benefit streams. The economic wage rate of\nunskilled labor is 90 percent of the financial wage rates. Estimated benefits from the subprojects\nwere  derived  based  on  avoidance  of  damage  to  existing  assets,  avoided  disruptions  to\nagricultural and industrial production, and avoided emergency repairs of the flood embankment.\nKey assets in the flood-prone areas include standing crops, public infrastructure, and buildings\n(residential, commercial, and industrial). Potential disruption to economic activities is caused not\nonly by floodwater, but also by the deposition of silt on agricultural and urban areas, which\nwould reduce agricultural outputs for at least one year and entail substantial recovery costs.\n122. To calculate the economic internal rates of return (EIRRs), core subproject benefits were\nannualized by adjusting the total estimated flood damages by the probabilities of floods, under\nthe with-project and without-project scenarios. The magnitude of damage in different parts of the\nflood-prone areas was adjusted according to the expected levels of inundation as simulated by\nYRCC.  For  flood-prone  areas  with  lower  potential  economic  growth,  benefits  were  mostly\nderived from the lower risk of damages. In areas with good potential for economic growth, such\nas  Kaifeng  County,  benefits  were  largely  derived  from  enhanced  economic  growth  made\npossible due to investment in the core subproject. Benefits from the platforms were calculated\nas those of the embankments. However, potential losses due to flooding were limited to the\nestimated loss of private and community properties on existing platforms because the platforms\ndo not protect assets outside the platforms.\n123. The costs of subprojects include the costs of land acquired, resettlement, survey and\ndesigns,  construction,  construction  supervision,  environment  mitigation  measures,  and\nsubproject management. The costs of land acquisition and temporary construction sites are\nbased on the forgone economic agricultural incomes, estimated at about Y8,925 per ha per\nseason. The estimated compensation costs for structures dismantled as part of the resettlement\nactivities were based on their reconstruction costs.\n124. The estimated EIRRs are 14, 19, and 17 percent for the subprojects at Changyuan,\nKaifeng,  and  Dongping,  respectively.  Similar  EIRRs  are  expected  for  the  other  candidate", "31\nsubprojects to be included in the Project. These estimates are robust, given the relatively limited\nscope of benefits accounted for in the economic evaluation. The benefit estimates excluded the\navoidance of injuries, hospitalization, loss of lives, mobilization of flood-fighting crews, and\nlarge-scale emergency evacuation that will occur during major floods. The economic evaluation\nalso excluded potential loss, such as loss due to disruption of communication and transportation\nto areas adjacent to flood-prone zones, and loss of household assets, livestock, and farm\nmachinery.  The  EIRRs,  therefore,  provide  conservative  estimates  of  the  true  social  and\neconomic benefits of the Project.\nB.  Social Dimensions\n125. Construction of residential platforms at five locations in the Changyuan subproject area\nwill also provide opportunities for promoting communal solidarity through the process of village\ndevelopment and settlement planning. The Project will support exchange visits by local leaders\nand community-nominated representatives from the proposed platform sites to the successfully\ndeveloped platform sites. An action research program involving ESD members will facilitate a\nparticipatory  planning  and  impact  monitoring  process  by  stakeholder  residents,  local\ngovernment, and planning agencies. The program will involve community planning of new\nvillage designs, land-use issues (e.g., housing standards, sanitation infrastructure, and public\nspaces), and managing and monitoring use of the development funds.\nC.  Impact on Poverty\n126. From 1994 to 2000, the PRC implemented a poverty reduction program in counties\nofficially classified as poor by national or provincial standards in remote mountain, desert, and\nloess plateau regions; reservoir catchments; areas with endemic local disease; and former\nrevolutionary bases. Poor transport, environmental instability, slow economic growth, lack of\ndrinking water, and extremely harsh conditions for production and livelihood characterized those\nlocations. A national workshop in 1996 stressed that poverty reduction activities should reach\nthe household level, respond to actual situations and local conditions, respect the opinions of\npoor  households,  and  promote  self-motivation  and  participation.  A  national  poverty  policy,\nconfirmed at the poverty conference jointly convened by the Government, the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, and ADB in May 2000, recognized that the poor are now found in\nboth designated poor and non-poor counties, in rural and urban areas, and predominantly in\nwestern PRC. The poor and the near poor risk further impoverishment through environmental or\neconomic  shocks,  and  reducing  their  poverty  will  require  comprehensive  socioeconomic\napproaches and participatory methods. Such methods and approaches need to be gender\nsensitive.  Predominantly  male  out-migration  to  undertake  seasonal  or  long-term  off-farm\nemployment has also resulted in women comprising a significant portion of the farm labor force\nin  a  sector  characterized  by  relatively  low  returns,  particularly  for  undiversified  grain  crop\nfarming.\n127. Based on Y1,000 per capita income poverty threshold,41 poverty incidence in the high-\nrisk  counties  is  estimated  at  11.8  percent  (13.2  percent  for  Henan  and  7.5  percent  for\nShandong). These are higher than the poverty incidence in Henan and Shandong as a whole,\nwhich stood at 11.0 and 5.9 percent, respectively, in 1999. The number of poor within the 43\n                                                \n41Y1,000 is used as the equivalent line due to lack of available information. The international poverty line is $1 per\ncapita per day in constant 1985 dollars, purchasing power parity adjusted, which is equal to Y947 per capita per\nannum in 1999 prices (Source: The Leading Group for Poverty Reduction, the World Bank, and the United Nations\nDevelopment  Programme.  2000  China:  Overcoming  Rural  Poverty.  Paper  presented  at  the  International\nConference on China\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy in Early 21st Century, Beijing, 16-18 May 2000).", "32\nhigh-risk counties therefore, is about 3.9 million. Moreover, household surveys showed that 25.1\npercent of the population or 8.2 million persons belonged to the Y1,000-Y1,500/person-year\nincome bracket.  This group, as much as the poor, is particularly vulnerable to flood damages\nand  consequent  losses  and  stresses.  These  income  levels  should  be  compared  with  the\nY2,000-Y2,500 loss per capita42 experienced in the past flooding in the areas. The data suggest\nthat in the 43 counties alone, a major flood will adversely affect about 12 million persons in\nterms of incomes and standard of living.\n128. The average per capita net annual incomes in the core subproject areas range from\nY1,386 to Y2,202. Poverty incidence at the subproject sites is 7.4-24 percent, based on the\ninternational one-dollar-a-day poverty line. In areas such as the subproject site at Dongping,\nthere are pockets of poverty where village-level per capita incomes fall below the poverty line.\nPoverty in the floodplain is caused by location, lack of skills and income-earning opportunities\nfrom  nonagriculture  livelihoods,  poor  health  status  of  adults  in  the  family,  and  frequent\nhousehold  relocations  due  to  floods  and  past  resettlement  policies.  Non-income  poverty\nindicators in these areas include seasonal food scarcity in some counties and inadequate\naccess to clean water and sanitation. Adult illiteracy rates are 11-30 percent in nine villages in\nChangyuan and Kaifeng, predominantly among women. In the case of Changyuan, most of the\npoor reside on smaller and lower platforms with a greater risk of flooding. Their farms are small\nand agriculture, particularly grain production, provides 60-80 percent of household income,\ncompared  with  40-45  percent  for  the  non-poor.  The  detailed  social  and  poverty  impact\nassessment is in Appendix 13.\n129. During implementation, the Project will generate incomes for the floodplain communities,\nincluding  the  poor,  from  the  labor-intensive  construction  of  embankments  and  platforms.\nApproximately 23.5 million person-days of manual employment will be generated, of which 2.4\nmillion person-days will be needed at the three core subproject sites. This means employment\nfor about 52,000 unskilled laborers over the next four years. Based on the estimated poverty\nincidence at the subproject sites and with priority to the poor in jobs at those sites, about 2.7\nmillion person-days or about Y41 million in wages will be directed to poor households. The\nestimated  employment  created  excludes  jobs  generated  by  construction  of  village\nfacilities__schools, clinics, and utility structures__on the new platforms. After the construction\nperiod, jobs will also be available for maintaining the new village platforms. This is estimated at\n14,600 person-days per year. Although project activities are not aimed at income generation,\nthe extra incomes earned from construction work will give households the rare opportunity to\nbuild savings and, thus, accumulate capital for income-generating enterprises and reduce the\nrisk of their falling back into poverty.\n130. In relocating houses to the new platforms, which is voluntary, the Project requires that\npart  of  or  the  full  relocation  costs  for  poor  households  be  met  by  the  national  and  local\ngovernments. This particularly applies to the extremely poor whose poverty is long-term in nature\nand relates to lack of employment, debilitating illnesses, or other incapacities. The group includes\nthose who are old, childless and infirm, widowed, or orphaned. The extremely poor are on the\nofficial register of the county civil affairs bureaus to receive state-provided clothing, medical care,\nhousing, and burial expenses. They are also widely recognized by other villagers as a discrete\ngroup that can be publicly and fairly identified for access to preferential relocation assistance.\n                                                \n42 In 1999 prices, based on data from Changyuan and surrounding areas.", "33\nD.  Risks\n131. The project design takes into account potential technical and economic risks. The main\nrisks,  which  could  result  in  implementation  delays  and  cost  overruns,  are  associated  with\nabnormal  rainfall  and  unexpected  floods  that  will  adversely  affect  the  construction  of\nembankments and river training works during project implementation. To mitigate these risks,\nthe project design includes measures to facilitate rapid implementation, avoiding construction\nduring  the  rainy  season.  Advance  action  for  procurement,  consultant  recruitment,  and\nretroactive financing are expected to substantially shorten the time required to start construction\n(para. 94). Adequate amounts of the loan proceeds will be made available on a timely basis\nthrough imprest accounts (para. 97). The provision of project management consultants will also\nexpedite  subproject  selection  and  preparation  of  IEE/EIA  and  resettlement  plans.  These\nmeasures should mitigate the risk of delayed implementation.\n132. Although the ground elevation of village platforms to be constructed under the village\nflood protection component will be designed for above normal floods, there is the risk of floods\nexceeding the design flood level (para. 68). To mitigate the risk, the Project will provide an\neffective flood forecasting and warning system, giving timely and accurate flood warnings to the\nvillagers who may need to evacuate the inner floodplain. The Project will provide the equipment\nand software for the flood forecasting and warning system and the equipment of the emergency\nrescue team.43\nVI.  ASSURANCES\n133. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  The Government will take into account the findings and recommendations of the\nassociated TA with respect to the integrated management of the Yellow River\nbasin, cost recovery mechanism and water pricing. The Government will also\nconsult with ADB as necessary in preparing the draft Yellow River Law.\n(ii)  The Government will ensure that the subproject selection and implementation\nprocedures  set  forth  in  paras.  84  and  85  are  followed,  including  (a)  the\npreparation of IEEs/EIAs in accordance with the relevant PRC environmental\nlaws and regulations and ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines, and approval of such\nIEEs/EIAs by SEPA and ADB; and (b) if required, preparation of a resettlement\nplan  in  accordance  with  PRC  laws  and  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on\ninvoluntary resettlement and the resettlement procedural guidelines prepared for\nthe Project (Appendix 7), and ADB approval of such plan.\n(iii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  adequate  counterpart  funds  and  other\ncounterpart  requirements,  including  local  government  funds  and  in-kind\ncontributions from beneficiaries, are provided for the Project and subprojects on\na timely basis.\n(iv)  MWR/YRCC will ensure that all lands and rights-of-way required for the Project\nare made available in a timely manner. For any subproject involving involuntary\nresettlement, MWR/YRCC will ensure that the resettlement plan is carried out in\n                                                \n43 The emergency rescue team is a semigovernment body under the supervision of YRCC and is financed 50 percent\nfrom the national budget. The team is a flood-fighting brigade, patrolling the embankment 24 hours during the flood\nseason and rescuing flood-affected people when necessary.", "34\naccordance  with  PRC  laws  and  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary\nresettlement and the resettlement procedural guidelines;\n(v)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  for  each  subproject,  the  environmental\nmitigation measures set forth in the IEE/EIA are implemented in accordance with\nthe relevant PRC laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines.\n(vi)  The Government will ensure that all facilities rehabilitated or constructed under\nthe  Project  are  operated  and  maintained  by  YRCC,  except  those  facilities\nconstructed  by  the  local  governments  under  the  village  flood  protection\ncomponent, which will be operated and maintained by such local governments.\n(vii)  YRCC will establish a PME system in the PMO acceptable to ADB, including the\nindependent  PRA  assessment  of  project  impacts  in  poor  areas.  YRCC  will\nconduct a benchmark survey at the start of the Project and will prepare and\nsubmit to ADB a PME report upon project completion and one year thereafter.\n(viii)  YRCC will carry out gender analysis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender\nand Development for village flood protection subprojects and flood control work\nsubprojects  that  require  preparation  of  resettlement  plans.  YRCC  will  also\nmonitor  the  project  effects  on  women  during  implementation  by  collecting\ngender-disaggregated data and analyzing the PME and resettlement reports.\n(ix)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  for  subprojects  under  the  village  flood\nprotection  component,  the  local  governments  will  construct  and  complete\nhousing for the poor and the public infrastructure under such subprojects within\ntwo years from the date of completion of the new platform.\nVII.

Under the flood control works component, two core subprojects, Kaifeng embankments\nreinforcement and Dongping flood retention, were studied; and under the village flood protection\ncomponent, Changyuan platform was studied. The following paras. briefly describe the core\nsubprojects.\n1.  Kaifeng Embankment Reinforcement\n2. The project works entail strengthening over 8.4 kilometers (km) of the right embankment\nof the Yellow River in the vicinity of Kaifeng City.  The works will improve embankment stability,\nminimize seepage through the embankment at high water levels, and increase the time an\nerosive attack from the river would take to breach the embankment. High rates of seepage and\nthe consequent erosion of the embankment material pose the greatest threat of a breach.\n3. The present embankment was built up from the original natural levees by repeated\nwidening and raising through the years. The quality of construction works has varied according\nto prevailing technical knowledge and sociopolitical conditions. Many structural problems have\naccumulated within the embankment over time: (i) non-homogeneous soil, (ii) joints between\nconstruction layers, (iii) lack of proper compaction, (iv) historical breaches and avulsions leaving\nweak foundations, (v) emergency repairs carried out with materials immediately available, and\n(vi) wild animal dens and burrows.\n4. Construction of a new embankment on the inner floodplain some 100 meters (m) from\nthe existing main embankment is proposed.  The area between the new and old embankments\nwill be filled with warped material.  Originally, warping was carried out using a sand-water mix\ndredged from the riverbed.  Recently, it was found that more suitable warping material is\nobtained from borrow pits on the floodplain close to the river. Where the new embankment and\nwarped area would affect existing settlements, a cutoff wall will be constructed in the old main\nembankment, leaving the settlements undisturbed. The total length of the new embankment is\naround 7 km, and the cutoff wall, 1.4 km.\n5. The warping material is loosened and made into a slurry by high pressure hoses.  The\nslurry is pumped overland at distances up to 5 km to the area between the embankments,\nwhere it is discharged into prepared lined basins and allowed to drain and consolidate naturally.\nBy greatly increasing the width of the embankment, even with poor construction material, the\nstability of the outer slope is improved, seepage reduced, and the distance through which the\nriver would have to cut the embankment in the event of an erosive attack increased.\n6. Where warping would entail significant relocation of villages at the inner foot of the\nembankment, cutoff walls are proposed. The wall is constructed along the center line of the\nembankment from the relatively impermeable subsurface to the embankment crest, creating a\nnear impermeable barrier within the embankment.  The wall may be a cement-soil mix in situ\npiled wall, where the required depth is less than 16-18 m, or a diaphragm wall of nonreinforced\nconcrete 0.22 m wide for greater depths. This virtually eliminates seepage and the threat of\nembankment failure from seepage erosion.  While the construction of the piled wall is relatively\nstraightforward, excavating the trench for the diaphragm wall will expose cracks and voids in the\nembankment structure.  Where these are large, techniques to construct the diaphragm wall\nhave  to  be  perfected  by  the  Yellow  River  Conservancy  Commission  (YRCC),  which  will\ncontinuously study the most efficient and economical way of preventing floods.", "43 Appendix 3, page 2\n2.  Dongping Flood Retention Basin\n7. The  subproject  is  in  Dongping,  Liangshan,  and  Wengshan  counties  of  Shandong\nProvince, and lies southeast of Dongping Lake. The Dongping flood retention basin consists of\na  209-square  kilometer  (km2)  natural  lake  (Dongping)  surrounded  by  an  embankment.\nImmediately adjacent is an artificial 418 km2 second basin (outer lake) that is also surrounded\nby an embankment.1 The Dongping flood retention basin is a vital link in flood management for\nthe lower reaches of the Yellow River and its main function is to cut off the Yellow River\u2019s peak\nfloods, and maintain the discharge in Aishan (just downstream of Dongping's outlet to the\nYellow River) at below 10,000 cubic meters per second (m\u00b3/s). This is achieved by diverting a\nmaximum of 8,500 m\u00b3/s into the flood storage area. This function is vital for safeguarding\nstrategic locations downstream, such as Jinan City (capital of Shandong Province), railway\nlines, and the oilfields. As the embankment has a number of structural weaknesses, significant\nupgrading  is  necessary  to  make  it  safe.  The  subproject  focuses  on  upgrading  the  outer\nembankment along the artificial outer lake and removing unused old irrigation facilities. The\nsubproject\u2019s main components consist of (i) constructing about 18 km of diaphragm walls; (ii)\nreconstructing  stone  armoring  of  embankment  along  about  22  km,  and  placing  geotextile\nmaterial to strengthen the embankment and allow plants to grow; (iii) dismantling two disused\nsluices; and (iv) upgrading 10 sections of auxiliary roads along a total length of about 900 m,\nand constructing 19 flood observation houses with platforms.\n8. Owing to wind-generated waves in the basin, stone armoring is required up to the\npredicted wave height when the basin is filled.  Along the entire length, the armoring has to be\nraised by 1.0-1.5 m in places. The existing stone armoring is in a state of partial collapse and\nhas to be rebuilt on a proper base.  Along the embankment are two irrigation sluice gates\ndesigned to release water to the outer area for irrigation.  The gates date from the original multi-\npurpose reservoir design and are no longer in use.  The sluices lie on old river courses and\nrepresent weak points in the embankment. They will be removed and the embankment rebuilt.\n3.  Changyuan Platforms\n9. To increase the security of the villagers living in the inner floodplain (i.e., unprotected by\nembankments),  it  is  proposed  that  raised  platforms  be  built  for  five  villages  with  a  total\npopulation of 4,619, together with improvements on the evacuation roads and bridges.  The\nvillages are around 4 km from the main embankment, and 2 km from the main river course.\n10. Based on a per capita area of 60 square meters (m2), the total plan area of the platforms\nin all five villages will be 650,000 m2.  Accommodation for the villagers will be constructed on the\nplatforms, 17 m2 per capita totaling 78,500 m2.  A new platform with one-storey houses is the\npreferred option.2  It offers a \"cleaner\" engineering solution and also simplifies resettlement\nplanning.\n11. A road will be constructed to the top of the platform, and the main roads in the villages\nwill be paved (total of 11.2 km), new school buildings in the villages constructed (5,000 m2),\ndrainage channels provided, and a belt of trees planted around the villages. Narrow earth tracks\nserving two villages will be paved over a distance of 12 km and two minor bridges rebuilt.  The\n                                                \n1 Currently, the lake bottom area is fully cultivated by farmers living outside of the retention basin. The area is strictly\ncontrolled by the local governments to prevent the migration of people from outside.\n2 A comparative study of one-storey houses with higher platforms and two-storey houses with lower platforms was\nmade.", "44 Appendix 3, page 3\n150-m bridge across the Wenyan Channel will be rebuilt at a higher level and widened to a\ndouble carriageway.\n12. The borrow pit for the material to raise the platforms will be located around 1 km from\nthe main river beyond a low embankment constructed by local people.  The land, though\ncultivated in the dry season, is reportedly flooded most years.  It is proposed to make a slurry of\nthe material in the borrow pit and pump the slurry to temporary spoil tips adjacent to the villages,\na technique known as warping, over a distance of 1 to 2 km.", "45 Appendix 4, page 1\nCOST ESTIMATES\n1. Introduction\n1. The total project cost is estimated at Y3,347 million ($405 million), of which Y1,243\nmillion ($150.270 million) is the foreign exchange cost. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will\nfinance $150 million of the foreign exchange cost or 37 percent of the project cost. The Danish\nGovernment  will  provide  a  grant  of  $300,000  for  consulting  services:  $270,000  in  foreign\nexchange costs and $30,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The ADB loan financing will\ncover the interest during construction (IDC), commitment charges, and front-end fee. The total\nproject cost, excluding IDC and commitment and front-end fees, is estimated at Y3,135 million\n($379 million).  The  project  costs  include  incremental  operating  costs  for  studies  under  the\nnonstructural  subprojects  and  project  management  office  (PMO)  operations.  The  cost\nestimates, however, exclude routine operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of infrastructure\nbuilt  under  the  Project.  Table  A4  gives  a  breakdown  of  the  total  project  cost  by  project\ncomponent.\n2.  Parameters and General Assumptions\n2. The project costs were estimated based on cost and price data as of December 2000.\nThe following general parameters were used in estimating costs:\n(i)  The  exchange  rate  for  base  cost  calculation  is  Y8.27  per  $  for  the  project\nimplementation period of five years.\n(ii)  Domestic  inflation  rates  were  assumed  to  be  2.0  percent  for  2001  and  3.0\npercent thereafter. The foreign exchange costs were inflated at the rate of 2.4\npercent per annum.\n(iii)  Physical contingencies are 10 percent for all types of expenditure, except for the\ncost of core nonstructural subprojects and project management, which is set at 5\npercent.\n(iv)  Interest during construction (IDC) was estimated on a biannual (6 months) basis,\nusing an interest rate of 6.32 percent per annum, the rate applicable to the 5-year\nswap  LIBOR  rate  for  US  dollars.  The  loan  outstanding  includes  loan  funds\ndisbursed, cumulative interest, front-end fees, and commitment fees.\n(v)  Commitment charges are 0.75 percent of the shortfalls in disbursements from the\ndisbursement thresholds indicated in the Loan Agreement. The thresholds are 15\npercent of the total loan amount for the first year of project implementation, and\n45, 85, and 100 percent for the second, third, and fourth years, respectively.\n(vi)  The front-end fee equivalent to 1 percent of the total loan amount (i.e., $1.5\nmillion) is charged after loan signing. The amount and its interest charges are\ncapitalized  into  the  total  loan  amount  for  the  duration  of  the  project\nimplementation period.\n(vii)  Project costs include duties and taxes applicable to the items required under the\nProject.\n3. The following are the estimated foreign exchange contents and tax rates applicable to\nthe different types of expenditure:\n(i)  Forty-three percent of the cost of civil works is considered as indirect foreign\ncost. Civil works include construction of village platforms and physical models for", "46 Appendix 4, page 2\nthe river morphology and reservoir operation studies. Civil works are subject to a\nvalue-added tax of 17 percent, or 14 percent of gross contract costs.\n(ii)  One hundred percent of the costs of equipment (including earthmovers, dump\ntrucks), materials (e.g., software and data), vehicles, and international consulting\nservices were considered as foreign costs. ADB financing excludes taxes, duties,\nand related local costs (domestic shipping costs and brokerage fees). A value-\nadded tax of 17 percent was applied to the net prices of equipment, material, and\nvehicles.  Further,  a  100  percent  import  duty  was  incorporated  in  the  cost\nestimates of vehicles.\n(iii)  The total expenses for international study tours and training were considered\nforeign exchange costs.\n(iv)  Thirty-five percent of the cost of general monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and\nenvironmental/resettlement  monitoring  of  subprojects  was  counted  as  foreign\ncost. Twenty percent of domestic training expenses was also considered foreign\nexchange component to account for the use of imported training materials and\nshort-term engagement of foreign resource persons. The estimated rate of tax on\ndomestic training activities is 17 percent of net costs.\n(v)  Land acquisition and compensation, surveys and detailed designs, construction\nsupervision, construction of village facilities, dismantling of old village platforms,\ndomestic consultants, and project administration/PMO operations do not have\nany foreign exchange costs. Therefore, they are not to be financed under the\nADB  loan.  No  tax  will  be  levied  on  land  acquisition  and  resettlement\ncompensation.\n4.

Introduction\n1. In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement  policy,  resettlement  will  be\nimplemented through the resettlement policy framework (RPF) and resettlement procedural\nguidelines (RPG). RPF and RPG stipulations apply to all subprojects that are prepared and\napproved for inclusion in the sector loan. Three core subproject resettlement plans (RPs) have\nalready been prepared for the Kaifeng, Changyuan, and Dongping subprojects in accordance\nwith the RPF and RPG and these will form models for land acquisition and resettlement under\nnew subprojects.\nB. Resettlement Policy Framework\n2. The  RPF  reflects  both  borrower\u2019s  regulations  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary\nresettlement.  The  main  RPF  principles  follow:  (i)  minimize  negative  impacts  as  much  as\npossible, (ii) carry out resettlement and compensation so as to improve or at least restore the\npre-project living standards of the affected people (AP), (iii) fully inform and consult closely with\nAPs on compensation options and RP design, (iv) provide asset compensation at replacement\nrates, and (v) provide compensation for lost assets and resettlement subsidies in full prior to\nground leveling and demolition. Disbursement for each subproject will be conditional upon\nADB\u2019s approval of the subproject RP.\n3. The RPF stipulates eligibility and entitlement provisions for land losses, house losses,\ncrop losses, and loss of other assets. Land losses will be compensated as follows: (i) APs losing\nagricultural and residential land will be compensated through land-for-land arrangements, or\nland reallocation within village domains; (ii) if land-for-land arrangements are not feasible, the\nAP losing agricultural land will be reclassified and provided with job opportunities; (iii) cash\ncompensation for lost land will be paid at the rates stipulated by the 1998 Land Law to the\nvillages  which,  in  turn,  will  use  the  funds  received  for  infrastructure  and  services  directly\nbenefiting the affected communities. Resettlement subsidies for land acquired will be directly\npaid to the AP in cash through the village offices. Compensation for house losses will be paid\ndirectly to the AP in cash at replacement cost free of demolition costs and salvaged materials.\nCompensation for crop losses will be paid directly to the AP in cash at current market prices.\nVulnerable households will receive assistance for house relocation and reconstruction, to be\norganized by the Village Committee.  The Environmental and Social Division (ESD) in the\nYellow  River  Conservancy  Commission  (YRCC)  will  pay  particular  attention  to  developing\neffective income restoration strategies for APs below the poverty line.\nC. Resettlement Procedural Guidelines\n4. Appropriate RPs have been prepared for the three core subprojects. For subprojects yet\nto be identified, specific RPGs have been established to guide RP preparation and to provide a\ndifferentiated approach commensurate with the magnitude of the impact of each subproject.\n5. The established RPGs require the following procedures: (i) after subproject identification\nand completion of preliminary technical design, YRCC carries out an impact survey to determine\nthe magnitude of impacts; (ii) if, through this process, the subproject impacts are identified as", "52 Appendix 7, page 2\nsignificant,1 YRCC will prepare a full RP; (iii) if the initial screening concludes that subproject\nimpacts are less than significant, YRCC will instead prepare a short RP. 2\nD.   Institutional Responsibilities\n6. The  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  (MWR)  through  YRCC  has  overall  coordination,\nplanning,  implementation  and  financing  responsibilities.  Local  city  or  county  governments,\nthrough the resettlement offices, will be responsible for implementing the agreed-upon RPs,\nincluding assets valuation, consultation, and delivery of entitlements. The local city and county\nland management bureaus are responsible for land recording and acquisition approvals. Field\ntasks such as paying entitlements, selecting replacement land, providing livelihood support, and\nmonitoring will be the responsibility of township officers.\n7. MWR through YRCC will ensure that the resettlement offices are briefed on these RPF\nand RPG arrangements for subproject developments, and on RPs once they are prepared.\nMWR  through  YRCC  will  ensure  that  resettlement  budgets  are  delivered  on  time  to  the\nprovinces, that payments are made directly and on time to the villages and the individuals\naffected, and that any shortfalls required to meet resettlement objectives are made good. The\nentitlements will be given to the affected people before ground leveling and demolition start, or\nelse income support will be provided for the period of dislocation.\nE. Disclosure, Consultation, and Grievance Redress\n8. Each RP will be prepared and implemented in close consultation with APs and will\ninvolve surveys and village meetings. RPs in the Chinese language will be made available to\nthe public in township offices. Complaints and grievance procedures will be established in each\nRP. Grievances will first be lodged with the village committee. If no settlement is reached within\ntwo weeks, the complainant has one month to elevate the grievances to the County Land\nManagement  Bureau.  If  still  unresolved  within  two  weeks,  the  case  can  be  sent  to  the\ncorrespondence departments of other government agencies or the resettlement office. Final\nappeal is available in the civil courts as established by the Regulations for Administrative\nRedress.\nF. Monitoring and Evaluation\n9. YRCC will establish a monthly reporting system involving resettlement staff at township\nand county level. External monitoring will be assigned to an independent agency. MWR/YRCC\nwill report to ADB on land acquisition and resettlement in the quarterly progress report.\nG.  Resettlement Cost\n10.

Objectives\n1. The objectives of the technical assistance (TA) are to conduct strategic studies relating\nto integrated water resources management of the Yellow River basin and to search for legal\ncountermeasures for outstanding problems in the Yellow River basin, to provide the National\nPeople\u2019s Congress (NPC) with data and recommendations in formulating the Yellow River Law.\nB.  Scope\n2. The TA will (i) review the baseline information and data on social, environmental,\neconomic, and technical conditions of the Yellow River basin; (ii) identify socioeconomic\ndevelopment opportunities and assess problems and constraints, giving due attention to the\nspecific characteristics of the river and the diversified nature of the basin area; (iii) review\nrelevant Government policies and plans as well as the current institutional setup for water\nresources management in general, and for the Yellow River in particular; (iv) prepare\ncomprehensive studies of the issues for effective water resources management and sustainable\nsocioeconomic development of the Yellow River basin; and (v) propose policy and legal\nrecommendations in formulating the Yellow River Law.\n3. The study will cover seven themes: (i) water resources management: focusing on a\ncomprehensive management system and mechanism for allocating and saving water, identifying\nthe supply and demand relationships between sustainable use of water resources and\nsocioeconomic development; (ii) water resources protection: focusing on the study of the\nresponsibilities and regulations for protecting water resources and preventing pollution; (iii) flood\nprotection and river management: river dredging and river training, including structural and\nnonstructural measures, and establishing effective flood control and disaster mitigation\nmechanisms, risk management system, and policy; (iv) soil and water conservation: setting\nrules and regulations for integrated planning and management emphasizing comprehensive\nbenefit evaluation through participatory approaches; (v) water pricing and cost recovery\nmechanism: evaluating and exploring the most efficient and effective mechanisms for collecting\nfees or levying charges or taxes on water users or beneficiaries, giving due consideration to\naffordability to the poor; (vi) financing mechanisms: assessing the financial capabilities of each\nlevel of the governments (central, provincial and cities/counties) for investment in basin\nmanagement and studying responsibilities in basin management of all levels of government and\nbasin administrative agencies; and (vii) management and institution: assessing international\nbest practices and exploring the possibilities for the most effective and efficient unified basin\nmanagement system and administration in the Yellow River basin.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n4. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,270,000 equivalent, comprising $562,000 in\nforeign exchange and $708,000 equivalent in local currency. The Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) will provide a grant of $970,000 from the ADB-funded TA program to cover the entire\nforeign exchange cost and $408,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will\ncontribute the balance of the local currency cost of $300,000 equivalent (Table A11).", "58 Appendix 11, page 2\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n5. Ministry of Water Resources (MWR) will be the Executing Agency and Yellow River\nConservancy Commission (YRCC) the implementing agency. An international consultant firm\nwill be primarily responsible for undertaking studies and developing practical recommendations\nfor the promulgation of the forthcoming Yellow River Law. Given the strategic importance and\nthe involvement of various sectors, a national steering committee (NSC) will be established for\ncoordinating the activities of the relevant ministries, agencies of local governments as well as for\nsupervising the TA. The members of NSC will be relevant specialists and representatives from\nthe State Development Planning Commission, Ministry of Finance, MWR, Ministry of\nAgriculture, Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Development, State Environment\nProtection Administration, State Forestry Administration, and other government agencies as well\nas representatives of the relevant local governments. Under supervision and coordination by\nNSC, the project management office (PMO) of YRCC will work closely with the consultants to be\nengaged under the TA.\n6. The TA will be completed in nine months beginning in November 2001, by a team of\ninternational consultants in association with domestic consultants (80 person-months in total).\nThe international consultants (17 person-months) will be engaged through a firm and selected in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The consultants (person-months\nand category in parentheses) will have expertise in (i) water resources management (7\ninternational, 9 domestic); (ii) environmental policy analysis and planning and water pollution (2\ninternational, 9 domestic); (iii) institutional strengthening, with knowledge of and experience in\ntax, charges, fees, and pricing issues (3 international, 9 domestic); (iv) legal issues with\nknowledge of river basin management (3 international, 9 domestic); (v) macroeconomic\nplanning, with experience in regional development (2 international, 9 domestic); (vi) socio-\nanthropology, with experience in poverty reduction and ethnic minority issues (9 domestic); and\n(vii) flood management (9 domestic). A domestic consultant with knowledge of soil conservation\nwill be engaged for four months. Consultants will procure equipment1 in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement.\n7. The PMO of YRCC will work closely with the consultants as counterpart staff. Additional\ncounterpart staff will be provided as and when necessary. The involvement of stakeholders will\nbe sought throughout the TA. The first NSC meeting, workshop, and tripartite meeting will be\nheld at an early stage of TA implementation to promote participation at all levels, agree on the\napproach to implementing the TA, and determine the detailed scope of the TA. Workshop\nparticipants will include representatives from the relevant ministries and provincial governments\nas well as relevant specialists. Representatives from external funding agencies, the private\nsector, and civil society will be also invited, but the TA will not fund their attendance, except for\nthe persons invited to serve as resource speakers. Representatives from the World Bank and\nAustralian Agency for International Development (AusAID) will be invited to present their\npreliminary findings and lessons obtained from the ongoing Yangtze River Flood Control and\nManagement Project. The second NSC meeting, workshop, and tripartite meeting will be\norganized at the TA\u2019s midterm to present preliminary findings and to elicit feedback. The two\nNSC meetings and workshops will coincide with tripartite meetings. At each workshop, the\nconsultants will provide concise reports for discussions. The reports will be revised and\nsubmitted to the Government and ADB for approval at the conclusion of each tripartite meeting.\n                                                \n1 Five laptop computers with appropriate software, three color printers with spare ink, fax machines, and office\nfurniture.", "59 Appendix 11, page 3\nAfter the consultant team submits the draft final report, the third NSC meeting will be held to\ndiscuss the outcome of the study and a future action plan.\n8. It will be useful to have overseas consultation to observe the comprehensive large-scale\nand advanced river basin management systems in ADB\u2019s member countries and to exchange\nviews on river basin management with officials. The cost for overseas consultation will not\nexceed 4 percent of the total TA budget.\n9. A final report incorporating comments from the Government, ADB, and workshop\nparticipants, including key Government policy makers and experts from academic societies, the\nprivate sector, civil society, and other relevant specialists, will be submitted within one month of\nthe conference.

Introduction\n1. The economic costs and benefits of the core subprojects were assessed to evaluate the\neconomic returns on the investments made in the subprojects. The analysis was conducted for\nan asset life span of 40 years, including the construction period. This estimate is conservative\nfor the types of structures built. The costs and benefits were expressed in constant 2000 prices,\nand valued using the domestic price numeraire method. All taxes and duties were excluded in\nderiving the economic values. Furthermore, the financial costs of traded goods were adjusted to\ntheir respective economic values using a shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) of 1.07,1 and the\nshadow wage rate for unskilled labor was estimated at 0.9 of the prevailing wage rate. All other\nlocal currency costs were assumed to equal their economic costs, after taxes and duties are\ndeducted.\n2. Since the Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCC) does not generate revenue\nfrom its flood protection services, and it is not operated as a financially independent entity, the\nfinancial internal rates of return of the subproject investments to YRCC are not a relevant\nindicator of subproject sustainability and therefore were not calculated. Financial evaluation\nfocused instead on the capacity of YRCC to sustain operation and maintenance (O&M) of the\nfacilities built under the Project.\nB.  Economic Costs\n3. The  subproject  costs  include  the  costs  of  land  acquired,  voluntary  and  involuntary\nresettlement, surveys and design, construction, construction supervision, environment mitigation\nmeasures, and subproject management. The costs of land permanently acquired or temporarily\ndisturbed were based on the average value of crop harvests, averaged at Y8,925 per hectare\nper year. The costs of buildings to be dismantled due to subproject construction were based on\ntheir replacement or reconstruction costs. The economic costs and benefits of the capacity-\nbuilding activities for YRCC and its regional offices were not analyzed since the economic value\nof institutional strengthening cannot be reliably estimated. Since the subprojects will rehabilitate\nand strengthen existing structures, there is potential for savings on O&M costs in the future.\nHowever, due to lack of firm data, the potential savings were also not analyzed.\nC. Economic Benefits\n4. Benefits were based on flood damage avoidance due to the subproject investments.\nPotential  damage  includes  losses  in  fixed  assets  (crops,  agriculture  land,  homes,  public\ninfrastructure, and industrial equipment and facilities); temporary disruptions of agricultural and\nindustrial production; costs of emergency evacuation; repair of flood control structures; and\nstunted investment and economic growth due to the prevailing flood risk. Only direct and\nquantifiable benefits attributable to flood protection were included in the benefit estimation.\n5. For the Changyuan platforms, the potential flood damages were calculated from the\nestimated value of assets on the existing platforms, derived from field surveys conducted in\n2000. The damage estimates were limited to assets on top of the platforms since the subproject\ninterventions will not protect assets outside the platforms. The extent (percent) of asset losses\nvaries with the level of inundation, types of asset affected, and size of inundated area. These, in\n                                                          \n1  SERF is the inverse of the standard conversion factor (SCF), which is 0.93.", "61 Appendix 12, page 2\nturn, are linked to the probabilities of river flow rate and height of the platforms. The new\nplatforms are designed to provide effective protection against normal floods.\n6. Using historical inundation data and asset loss rates on the existing platform and a flood\ndamage simulation model on the new platforms,2 total economic losses were estimated for\nvarying  levels  of  flood  severity,  for  the  with-  and  without-Project  scenarios  (Table  A12.1).\nAverage annual damages for Changyuan were, in turn, computed by estimating the area under\nthe damage-frequency curve (flood frequency plotted against associated damages). Table 1\npresents the annual damages for the with- and without-project scenarios and the incremental\nannual damage avoidance, estimated at Y7.6 million.\nTable A12.1: Estimated Annual Benefits of Changyuan Subproject\nDamages (Y '000) Annualized Damage Avoidance (Y\n'000)\nIncremental\nFlow Frequency Without With Without With Damage\n(m3/s) (%) Project Project Project Project Avoidance\n8,070 50.0 3,951 0 1,976 0 1,976\n9,830 20.0 13,136 0 3,215 0 3,215\n10,710 10.0 21,230 0 1,214 0 1,214\n12,400 5.0 33,375 0 911 0 911\n13,400 2.0 33,375 0 0 0 0\n15,700 1.0 49,753 0 246 0 246\n19,600 0.3 49,963 0 1 0 1\n Total 7,562 7,562\nm3/s = cubic meters per second.\nSource: ADB estimates.\n7. For the embankment protection subprojects, represented by Kaifeng and Dongping,\nestimated  benefits  were  derived  from  damage  avoidance  to  urban  and  rural  assets  and\neconomic activities in the flood-prone areas, covering 11,500 square kilometers (km2) in Kaifeng\nand 3,000 km2 in Dongping.3 Damage valuation was based mainly on values of crop and\nindustrial  outputs,  public  infrastructure,  and  industrial  assets.4  For  inundated  areas,  a\nconservative estimate of a one-season crop is assumed lost. Potential losses in horticulture\noutputs, farm implements, and household items were not included in the calculation due to lack\nof  data.  Likewise,  the  necessary  cleanup  and  silt  removal  costs  from  urban  areas  and\nagricultural lands after the floods were not included in the damage estimates.\n8. As in the case of Changyuan, flood simulation models were used to estimate coverage\narea, inundation depth, and percentages of asset losses under different flood circumstances.\nFloods with a 100-year return period are estimated to cause 20-25 percent damage to fixed\nassets in the flood-prone areas of Kaifeng and Dongping and dislocation of about 1.7 and 2.9\nmillion people, respectively. The estimated total losses in Kaifeng and Dongping areas due to\nvarying levels of flooding severity are presented in Tables A12.2 and A12.3. Unlike the platform\n                                                          \n2  The potential flood losses are further detailed in Supplementary Appendix C.\n3  Simulation models during the feasibility study suggest that severe flood can affect even larger areas, 28,000 km2 in\nKaifeng and 9,100 km2 in Dongping.\n4  Values  of  public  infrastructure  and  industrial  assets  were  derived  from  the  book  values  of  these  assets\n(construction and purchase costs minus depreciation), which generally underestimate their replacement costs.", "62 Appendix 12, page 3\nprojects, however, the risk (probability) of flooding in the flood-prone zones is determined not\nonly by the river flow or water height, but also by the probability of an embankment breach with\nand  without  the  Project.  Incremental  annual  damage  avoidance  was  calculated  for  the\nsubprojects in Kaifeng and Dongping, based on the damage-frequency curves. The results are\npresented in Tables A12.2 and A12.3.\n9. During the project life span of 40 years, the annual weighted average damages were\nassumed to increase with the incremental economic growth associated with improved flood\nprotection. These are 1- 2 percent per annum for the Changyuan and Dongping subprojects,\nand 2-3 percent for the Kaifeng flood protection zone, which has a higher investment and\neconomic growth potential.\nTable A12.2: Estimated Annual Benefits of Kaifeng Subproject\nBreach Probability Annualized Damage Avoidance\nRiver Flow (%) (Y '000)\nEstimated Incremental\nRate Frequency Without With Damage Without With Damage\n(m3/s) (%) Project Project (Y \u2018000) Project Project Avoidance\n12,400 5.00 1.5 0.0 25,317,144 18,988 0 18,988\n13,400 2.00 1.6 0.0 26,241,014   494 0   494\n15,700 1.00 2.0 0.0 27,888,891   428 0   428\n19,600 0.33 2.5 0.0 29,012,365   159 0   159\n22,600 0.10 3.0 0.0 29,944,205  52 0  52\nTotal 20,122 0 20,122\nm3/s = cubic meters per second.\nSource: ADB estimates.\nTable A12.3: Estimated Annual Benefits of Dongping Subproject\nBreach Probability Annualized Damage Avoidance\nRiver Flow (%) (Y '000)\nEstimated Incremental\nRate Frequency Without With Damage Without With Damage\n(m3/s) (%) Project Project (Y \u2018000) Project Project Avoidance\n15,700 1.00 8.0 0.0 16,514,833 13,212 0 13,212\n19,600 0.33 20.0 0.0 17,213,277   510 0   510\n22,600 0.10 50.0 5.0 17,809,191   346  15   331\nTotal 14,067  15 14,052\nm3/s = cubic meters per second.\nSource: ADB estimates.\nD. Economic Rates of Return\n10. The  estimated  economic  internal  rates  of  return  (EIRRs)  are  14.4,  19.3,  and  17.1\npercent for the Changyuan, Kaifeng, and Dongping subprojects, respectively. Sensitivity tests\non the EIRRs suggest that the subprojects give fairly robust economic returns even under\nadverse circumstances. Economic sustainability is most sensitive to delays in the realization of\nbenefits. The EIRRs, however, represent conservative estimates of the economic value of the\nProject,  given  the  limited  scope  of  benefits  considered  in  the  analysis.  Furthermore,  the\nestimated benefits exclude avoidance of substantial social and longer-term costs that are not\neasily quantified. These include losses resulting from hospitalization, death, and household", "63 Appendix 12, page 4\nrelocation;  and  disruption  caused  by  flooding  to  education,  family  life,  transportation,  and\ncommunications.\nE. Operation and Maintenance Requirements\n11. Operation and maintenance (O&M) of the embankment, warping and cutoff walls, and\nother related infrastructure range from Y60,000 to Y80,000 per kilometer per year, inclusive of\nY20,000 in staff and overhead costs. The costs generally correlate to the dimension (width and\nheight) of embankments in a particular location. The costs exclude in-kind material contributions\nfrom communities. In the past five years (1996-2000), YRCC has received adequate budgetary\nsupport from the central Government to meet the O&M requirements amounting to about Y98\nmillion per year for the lower reach of the Yellow River. These were allocated to O&M, and\nrepair and rehabilitation budget line items of YRCC.\n12. The  repairs  and  strengthening  of  aging  river  infrastructures  under  the  Project  are\nexpected to somewhat lower the O&M cost of these structures, at least in the medium term.\nNonetheless, YRCC does not foresee significant reduction in O&M commitment after the Project\nand expects that adequate maintenance will be available for structures built under the Project.\nSince  flood  protection  remains  a  priority  intervention  area  for  the  local  and  national\ngovernments, YRCC expects to receive O&M budget allocations that are at least equal, in real\nterms, to the resources provided in 1996-2000. Through the asset management improvements\nto be carried out under the Project, YRCC expects to obtain more up-to-date and precise data\non infrastructure conditions. This will enable the agency to better estimate and allocate the O&M\nbudget requirements in the future.", "64 Appendix 13, page 1\nSOCIAL AND POVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT\nA.  Government Policies on Poverty Reduction\n1. The People's Republic of China (PRC) National Poverty Reduction Plan (1994-2000)\ndesignated both the loess plateau and reservoir catchment areas as two of the five typical areas\nwhere  poverty  is  concentrated.  The  two  locations  are  characterized  by  poor  transport\ninfrastructure,  environmental  degradation,  slow  economic  growth,  and  low  suitability  for\nagriculture and livelihood. National and provincial governments further designated official poor\ncounties as the target for poverty reduction activities. In 1996, the Government stressed that\npoverty reduction efforts should reach the household level and adapt to local circumstances,\nrespect the aspirations of the poor, and promote self-help. Recent policies recognize that the\npoor are found in both designated poor and non-poor counties, in rural and urban areas but with\nhigher concentrations in the western provinces. Because the assisted poor easily revert to\npoverty because of adverse environment or economic shocks, reducing their poverty requires\ncomprehensive socioeconomic interventions and participatory methods.\n2. For the central and eastern provinces (including the flood-prone area to benefit from the\nProject), poverty reduction efforts will involve (i) identifying locally appropriate mechanisms to\naddress the remaining clusters of poverty, (ii) mobilizing national support and human and\nfinancial resources in the relatively well-off areas to assist poverty reduction efforts, and  (iii)\nstrengthening water management infrastructure along the lower reaches of the major rivers to\nprevent severe floods that contribute to major relapses into poverty.  National, provincial, and\nlocal governments have been addressing poverty and regional disparity through a number of\nmeasures,  including  development  of  transport  infrastructure,  prevention  of  floods  and\nmanagement of natural calamities, land improvements, and direct relief assistance. However,\nbudget  constraints,  limited  development  of  income-generating  opportunities,  and  lack  of\ntechnical extension assistance and credit availability continue to hamper poverty reduction\nefforts.\nB.  Socioeconomic Characteristics of the Yellow River Basin\n3. The Yellow River crosses nine provinces in its 5,464-kilometer journey from western\nPRC to the Bohai Sea. The total catchment area occupies 795,000 square kilometers (km2) and\ncontains about 18 percent of the nation\u2019s farmland.  However, available arable land has been\ndecreasing sharply due to severe erosion, particularly in the relatively poor Loess Plateau\nregion  of  the  upper  and  middle  reaches.  This,  in  turn,  contributes  to  high  rates  of  river\nsedimentation, which can exacerbate flooding in the lower reach. High rates of water extraction\nin the upper reaches also produce water shortages downstream in the drier months and have\nencouraged the widespread practice of storing water among households and industries. Heavy\nwater extraction also reduces awareness of flooding as a potential danger among populations\noutside  the  embankments.  This  is  particularly  the  case  where  many  locations  have  not\nexperienced significant flooding in the last 50 years.\nC.  Characteristics of the Project Area\n4. Although  the  boundaries  of  the  lower  river  catchment  area  are  well-defined,  the\ndemarcation of flood-prone area to benefit from the Project (i.e., project area) follows the county\nadministrative lines and therefore is less precise. The project feasibility study identified 113", "65 Appendix 13, page 2\ncounties within flood-prone areas in the river\u2019s lower reach (i.e., project area),1 while a Yellow\nRiver  Conservancy  Commission  study  in  1996  showed  that  43  of  the  113  counties  are\nparticularly vulnerable to inundation since they are located along the Yellow River and its\ntributaries. The 113 counties are in the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu, with\nthe 43 counties at highest risk confined to Henan and Shandong. The project area covers\n117,900 km2 and has an estimated population of 85 million. Hence, it is densely populated with\n723 persons/km2. Table A13.1 presents the characteristics of the flood-prone counties, grouped\naccording to their vulnerability to floods.\nTable A13.1: Characteristics of the Flood-Prone Area\nHigher Risk Area (as defined in 1996)\nCharacteristics of Most Intermediate Least\nPotentially Affected Potential Potential Potential Remaining Total At-\nCounties Damage a Damage b Damage c At-Risk Risk Area\nArea\nNo. of counties 18 25 25 45 113\nPopulation (million) 11.3 21.5 8.4 43.8 85.0\nRural labor (million) 3.7 7.0 __ __ __\nFemale Labor (million) 1.8 3.0 __ __ __\n(% of Rural Labor) (4.7) (43.0)\nAgriculture population 9.6 19.2 2.3 17.6 48.7\n(million)\nTotal area (\u2018000 km2 ) 21.20 28.40 14.50 53.80 117.90\nFarmland (%) 50.00 59.80 47.60 70.40 59.90\nArable land 0.09 0.08 0.08 0.10 0.09\n(hectare/person)\nIncome 2,071 1,774 2,399 2,314 2,112\n  (Y/capita-year)\nPer capita GDP (Y) 2,614 2,201 1,027 1,162 1,719\n__ = not available, GDP = gross domestic product.\na  Severe field flooding and erosion, crop loss, building collapse, and death or injury to livestock.\nb  Prolonged inundation leads to waterlogging, delayed crop management, transport disruption, and factory down-\ntime.\nc  Same as (b), but with less severe consequences.\nSource: 1999 provincial statistical yearbooks.\n5. Across 60 percent of the project area is relatively flat topography that facilitated the\ndevelopment of 11 major cities, dense transportation networks, key national north-south road\nand rail interchanges, and generally easy market access for industrial and agricultural products.\nParts of the area are also of historical significance. An area of 49,600 km2 that covers the 43\ncounties in Henan and Shandong and is particularly prone to inundation has a population of\n32.8 million, including 28.8 million in agriculture whose livelihood and crops are particularly\nvulnerable to floods. These counties are likely to suffer the most and intermediate potential\ndamages in the event of a flood (columns 1 and 2 in Table A13.1). The project area includes the\ninner  floodplains  (i.e.,  areas  inside  the  main  river  embankments).  The  inner  plains,  which\ncoincide with 85 percent of the lower river catchment area (4,647 km2), are home to 1.7 million\nresidents  living  in  2,193  villages.  The  inner  plains  are  relatively  densely  populated  (431\npersons/km2) and highly vulnerable to floods.\n6. Compared with the provinces in the western region, Shandong and Henan are relatively\nwell-off. The incidence of poverty in 1999 was estimated at 11 percent in Shandong and 5.9\n                                                \n1 Including county-level cities and city-level counties.", "66 Appendix 13, page 3\npercent in Henan. Poverty incidence in the counties with high flood risk is higher than the\nprovincial average__13.2 and 7.5 percent for Henan and Shandong (Table A13.2). This area is\ndensely populated, with 661 persons per km2. The rural population is estimated at 28.8 million\n(87 percent of total), of whom 10.7 million are part of the active labor force. Available arable\nland is limited at about 0.09 hectare (ha) per person. The number of poor within the 43 high-risk\ncounties is estimated at about 3.9 million. Furthermore, household surveys showed that 25.1\npercent  of  the  population  or  8.2  million  persons  belonged  to  the  near-poor  Y1,000-\nY1,500/person-year income bracket. The poor and those with incomes of Y1,500/person-year or\nless are particularly vulnerable to flood events since past floods in the area have caused\naverage losses of Y2,000-Y2,500 per capita.2 In the 43 high-risk counties alone, a major flood\nwill adversely affect about 12 million persons, incomes, and standard of living.\nTable A13.2.

Surveys in the core subproject areas suggest that the incidence of poverty at Kaifeng,\nChangyuan, and Dongping are 12, 24 and 7.4 percent, respectively.3 Relative poverty and\ndeprivation in the flood-prone areas are caused by many factors: natural calamities, which are\nmainly flooding, depleted natural resources, lack of access to markets, and low farm output\nprices. Individual hardship is exacerbated by illness, high household dependency ratios, and\nlack of labor and skills. In the inner floodplains, houses are usually single-storey, farm sizes are\nsmall averaging 0.4 ha, no additional land can legally be brought into production, drinking water\nis sourced from wells, and savings are sunk in livestock and assets that are prone to flood\ndamage.  Interviews  with  residents  indicate  that  the  psychological  impact  of  losing  homes,\npossessions, and confidence in future security is significant. Most of the poor reside on lower\nflood platforms with greater risk of flooding. In the subproject areas, agriculture, particularly\ncultivation of grains, provides 80 percent of income for the poor, whereas non-poor households\nderive 45 percent of their incomes from off-farm employment. Dependence on relatives and\nlocal  agencies  increases  in  times  of  natural  calamities,  since  rural  financial  markets  are\nrelatively weak and insurance schemes are practically nonexistent. The income-generation\ncapacity  of  poorer  residents  in  the  core  subproject  areas  is  hampered  by  higher  rates  of\nilliteracy and lower levels of education,4 lack of sufficient or surplus labor, lack of access to\n                                                \n2 In 1999 prices, based on data from Changyuan and surrounding areas.\n3 Estimation of poverty incidence at Dongping excludes data from the inner retention basin which has a poverty rate\nof over 50 percent. The households are excluded because they are not beneficiaries of the proposed embankment\nstrengthening  under  the  Project.  They  are  currently  receiving  assistance  from  the  national  and  provincial\ngovernments through an ongoing poverty reduction/livelihood program.\n4 The County Statistical Bureau sample survey of 2,960 persons (700 rural households) in Dongping County (1998)\nindicated that 8.3 percent of the population were illiterate or semiliterate.", "67 Appendix 13, page 4\ncredit,  and  lack  of  social  capital  to  obtain  adequate  informal  credit.  Women,  who  form  a\nsignificant but underestimated percentage of the rural labor force, are typically burdened during\nflood events by the need to obtain drinking water, and fuel and food, to help maintain the health\nof family members and household livestock, and to protect household properties.\n8. Substantial progress has been achieved in reducing poverty in the project provinces. In\nHenan, official figures indicate that the proportion of the poor (measured by the provincial\npoverty line) in the total rural population declined from 38 percent to 4 percent between 1979\nand 1988\u2014net reduction of 21.8 million persons classified as poor. Almost 92 percent of rural\nhouses in the province are now constructed from brick and wood or reinforced concrete, and\nhouse space per capita reached 23 square meters. Average provincial figures for net farmer\nincome per capita also indicate improved standards of living. Statistics from neighboring flood-\nprone Shandong Province also show a decline in the number of the poor from 7.6 million in\n1984 to 4 million in 1993.\nD.  Overview of Social Benefits\n9. The Project will reduce flood incidence and damage in the lower Yellow River Basin.\nIndirect benefits include environmental improvement and prevention of potential impoverishment\nthrough flood risk mitigation.\n10. The Project will yield social benefits for all residents of the flood-prone area through\n(i)  Reduced in risks to personal safety, livelihood, and assets. Flood warning and\nescape facilities and procedures will be improved in ways that create greater\ncommunity  involvement.  Risk  reduction  is  particularly  important  for  the\npredominantly agricultural population, which relies heavily on grains grown during\nthe flood season to meet home consumption, for livestock fattening, and for\nincome. Funds previously devoted to insurance or replacement of assets will\nbecome available for alternative productive and consumptive uses. Those most\nlikely to benefit are riverside residents whose flood-related losses have eroded\nresource reserves and hamper investment in farm activities.  Those residents\ntotal roughly one million in Henan and 420,000 in Shandong. Evidence from\nsample village participatory rural appraisal activities strongly suggests that poorer\nhouseholds  forgo  investment  in  high-risk  enterprises  such  as  livestock\nproduction, for fear that animals will be lost to floods. Moreover, frequent house\nrebuilding and furnishing have significantly drained their capacity to accumulate\nfinancial resources. The poorer residents, whose current levels of investment are\nconstrained by flood-related fear, will benefit from the security provided by the\nProject in flood mitigation.\n(ii)  Improved local government financial capacities. Data collected in the Dongping\nflood retention basin indicates relatively low levels of government investment in\nlocal social services and infrastructure provision, particularly for drinking water,\nlocal clinics, and roads.  Confidence that public infrastructure investments will be\nmore secure should encourage the government to invest in these locations.\n11. Although creating the necessary environment for income generation, the Project will not\nprovide focused assistance to the poor. The nature of flood mitigation requires that flood control\nstructures be placed in the most strategic locations to minimize inundation rather than in areas\nthat contain the largest number of the poor. Further, the Project is not intended to support", "68 Appendix 13, page 5\nimprovement of income-generation capacities of households or address the key impediments to\npoverty reduction in each location. The Project will, however, assist poor residents in the\nfollowing ways:\n(i)  The Project will foster community consultation and planning in designing\nsubprojects and formulating resettlement plans, which will enhance the\ncommunity\u2019s role in devising appropriate means of income restoration and\nallocation of funds and technical assistance earmarked for the communities.\n(ii)  Priority in employment will be given to poor households, particularly in\nconstructing and maintaining the platforms and other related local facilities.\nE.  Project Employment Impact\n12. The civil works under the Project are expected to generate significant employment\nopportunities and incomes to the communities, including the poor. For the Project as a whole,\napproximately 23.5 million person-days of unskilled labor will be required, of which 2.4 million\nperson-days will be needed for the construction of the core subprojects (Table A13.3). With an\naverage employment span of 3 months/person per year, the Project is expected to employ\nabout 52,000 unskilled laborers over the next four years. Based on the estimated poverty\nincidence at the subproject sites and with priority to the poor in obtaining employment at the\nconstruction sites, it is estimated that 2.7 million person-days or about Y41 million in wages will\nbe directed to poor households.\n13. No additional employment opportunity will be created for embankment maintenance\nsince operation and maintenance efforts and resources devoted to the river embankments will\nbe roughly the same with or without the Project. Incremental employment opportunity, however,\nwill  be  generated  from  the  maintenance  of  new  village  platforms.  This  is  conservatively\nestimated  at  14,600  person-days  per  year.  Employment  under  the  Project  will  not  be  a\nsustainable income-generating activity in itself, but the additional incomes earned will enable\nhouseholds to build savings and accumulate capital to undertake income-generating ventures.\nTable A13.3: Employment Impacts\nCore Subprojects\nItem Changyuan Kaifeng Dongping Project\nCivil work costs (Y \u2018000) 34,428.0 90,497.0 95,831.0 2,120,323.0\nShare of unskilled labora (%) 20.0 16.0 16.0 16.6\nUnskilled labor inputsb (person-day) 459,040.0 965,301.0 1,022,197.0 23,464,908.0\nPersons employed (no.) 2,550.0 5,363.0 5,679.0 52,144.0\nLabor of poor/Total laborc (%) 24.0 12.0 29.0 11.8\nLabor inputs (poor) (person-day) 110,170.0 115,836.0 296,846.0 2,768,859.0\na Based on subproject cost data.\nb Average salary = Y15 per day.\nc Based on estimated poverty incidence in the subproject sites and project area.

Distribution of Project Benefits\n14. The  three  core  subprojects  were  analyzed  to  assess  the  distribution  of  subproject\nbenefits to project stakeholders: the households, industry (including state-owned enterprises),\nand the public sector/economy. An assessment was also undertaken to determine the extent to\nwhich  the  Project  directly  benefits  the  poor.  The  economic  analysis  showed  benefits  to\nhouseholds were derived from employment opportunities, and direct avoidance of flood damage\nto crops and houses and disruption in farming activities. Industries will benefit from the Project\nin the form of reduced risk to flood damage and interruption in operations, while the public\nsector  will  benefit  from  damage  avoidance  on  public  infrastructure  and  savings  of  flood\nevacuation costs of the affected population. During the construction period, laborers will accrue\nbenefits from employment opportunities at the sites. The public sector will gain tax incomes, but\nwill have to bear most of the costs of investment. Tables A13.4-13.6 present the results of the\ndistribution analyses.
