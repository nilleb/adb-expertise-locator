The multitranche financing facility (MFF) for Uttar Pradesh Power Distribution Network \nRehabilitation Project will improve the quality and reliability of power supply in rural areas of Uttar \nPradesh. The project will reduce aggregate technical and commercial losses and improve cost \nrecovery in rural electricity supply. The project includes institutional capacity building to (i) expand \ncommunity participation in rural electricity distribution, especially in meter reading, billing, and \ncollection;  (ii)  promote  gender-sensitive  workplace  practices  in  the  project  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies,  covering  employees  and  contract  workers;  (iii)  improve  financial \nmanagement capacity, focusing on revenue recognition and collection of past receivables; and \n(iv) develop capacity in project management and safeguard compliance.  \n \n2.  The project is estimated to cost $800 million. The Government of India has requested \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a multitranche financing facility (MFF) of up to $430 \nmillion equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to finance part of the project. The MFF \nconsists of two tranches, subject to the government\u2019s submission of related periodic financing \nrequests, execution of the related work and project agreements for previous tranches under the \nMFF, and fulfillment of terms and conditions set forth in the  project\u2019s framework financing \nagreement. The government has also requested a technical assistance grant of $2.0 million to \nfinance institutional capacity building under output 3 of the MFF. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  A transaction technical assistance (TA), rather than ADB loan proceeds, is proposed to \nfinance output 3 as its activities will build institutional capacity and pilot test commercial initiatives \nthat do not create assets. Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) is a regulated entity, \nwhich means that the regulator must approve its expenditures and borrowing plans. The regulator \nis unlikely to allow the financing of capacity building, which does not create assets, through \nborrowings.  \n \n4.  The TA objectives are as follows: (i) improve rural revenue collection from prevailing levels \nof less than 50%; (ii) create jobs for rural women in the electricity supply industry; (iii) improve the \nrevenue management capacity of electricity distribution companies; (iv) promote gender-friendly \nworkplace practices in UPPCL; and (v) improve UPPCL\u2019s project management capacity.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities of the Transaction Technical Assistance  \n \n5.  Output 1: Innovative bill collection strategies involving the active participation of \nrural women pilot tested. The project will develop and pilot test solutions that improve bill \ncollection efficiency for the utility, while improving community engagement through smart devices \nsuch  as  smartphone-based  payment  applications  and  monitoring  tools.  The  initiative  will \ncontribute to economic welfare through new income options and empower women. The innovative \nbill collection mechanisms are expected to engage community members and representatives, \nspecifically women\u2019s self-help groups and community groups in meter reading, billing, and \ncollection using an incentive-based mechanism. Awareness raising on safe and efficient electricity \nusage will also be undertaken.  \n \n6.  Output 2: Gender-responsive human resource policies and measures for contract \nworkers and regular staff members developed and implemented. The initiative will help \n ", "  2 \nUPPCL and its contractors comply with gender equality laws and improve employees\u2019 attitudes \nto women participation in the workforce. The TA consultants will develop institutional assessment \nof human resource policies and practices relating to recruitment and staff development; work/life \npolicies, sexual harassment and discrimination policies; and gender-sensitive work environment \nafter undertaking a gap analysis with the prevailing practices. \n \n7.  Output 3: Initiatives to improve UPPCL\u2019s commercial and operational performance \nbased on an applied learning program implemented.  The TA consultants will organize a visit \nto  Japan  for  UPPCL  staff  to  learn  about  new  technologies  in  rural  electricity  distribution, \nmaintenance  of  distribution  networks,  and  customer  relationship  management,  including \ninformation technology (IT)\u2013enabled bill collection from Japanese electricity utilities.  \n \n8.  Output  4:  Financial  management  capacity  built,  and  revenue  recognition  and \nreceivables write-off  policy  developed  and implemented.  Delayed payment  by  different \nconsumer categories and high levels of accounts receivable have caused UPPCL significant \nfinancial stress. The situation needs to be rectified through improved systems that incorporate \ninnovative IT-based solutions. With the increase in number of rural metered consumers, UPPCL \nmust comprehensively review its billing and collection systems and introduce more advanced \nbilling software, electronic meter reading capability, and checks and balances to ensure that \nmeters are read and billed and that bills are collected on time. The Uttar Pradesh government has \nproposed a direct cash transfer scheme, with a direct debit facility, to subsidize low income \nresidential and agriculture consumers. The TA will support revenue management through (i) a \nreview of UPPCL\u2019s billing and collection systems and recommendations to upgrade the billing \nsystem with a built-in monitoring mechanism, (ii) integration of the direct cash transfer scheme \nwith UPPCL\u2019s billing system, (iii) development of IT-enabled tools for monitoring and taking \ncorrective  action  against  consumers  falling  behind  in  bill  payment,  (iii)  preparation  of  a \nprovisioning policy for uncollectible  receivables, and (iv) classification of receivables as collectible \nand uncollectible and provisioning for uncollectible receivables in financial statements.  \n \n9.  Output 5: Project monitoring capacity and compliance with ADB safeguard policies \nimproved. For the first time, UPPCL is implementing a project financed by an external financial \nagency.  Although  ADB  loan\u2013financed  project  management  consultants  will  monitor  the \ncontractor\u2019s performance, UPPCL needs additional assistance to increase its capacity to comply \nwith ADB\u2019s monitoring and reporting requirements and to update safeguard documents for \nsubproject /activities. The contractors, project management consultants, and UPPCL will be \ntrained  to  handle  environmental  and  social  safeguard  issues,  including  hazardous  waste \nmanagement and health and safety. The TA consultants will provide support for polychlorinated \nbiphenyl (PCB) testing of transformers and will independently monitor UPPCL\u2019s compliance with \nthe safeguard assessment and review framework and the environmental management plan. \n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA will be financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-others). The TA is estimated to cost $2,250,000 of \nwhich $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by JFPR and $500,000 will be financed by \nTASF-others. The TA activities pertaining to outputs 1, 2, and 3 will be financed by JFPR, and \nthose pertaining to outputs 4 and 5 will be financed by TASF-others.

The Uttar Pradesh Power Distribution Network Rehabilitation MFF Sector Project will \nimprove the quality of power supply and reliability in the rural areas of Uttar Pradesh. The project \nwill also reduce the aggregate technical and commercial (ATC) losses and improve cost recovery \nin electricity supply to rural areas.  \n \n2.  The MFF Sector Project also include institutional capacity building component to (i) \nenhance the community participation in rural electricity distribution and specially in meter reading, \nbilling  and  collections;  (ii)  promote  gender  sensitive  workplace  practice  in  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies  covering  both  direct  employees  and  contract  workers;  (iii)  improve \nfinancial  management  capacity  focusing  on  revenue  recognition  and  collections  of  past \nreceivables;  and  (iv)  enhance  capacity  building  on  project  management  and  safeguard \ncompliance. The TRTA is designed to provide the consulting inputs for this purpose.  \n \nII.   OUTPUTS AND ACTIVITIES OF THE TRTA \n \nA.  Output 1: Innovative bill collection strategies involving active participation of rural \nwomen pilot tested. \n3.  Uttar Pradesh, along with several other states, is investing in the installation of tamper-\nproof smart meters to make the state more energy-efficient and as a step towards checking \npilferage, providing better power supply, and enhancing revenue recovery. This is likely to ease \nthe process of billing. Nonetheless, collection of dues, especially as most bills are small amounts, \nremains a challenge as it requires a huge amount of manpower and at times, repeated visits to \nthe consumers, resulting in high transaction costs for the utility. This issue is faced by most utilities \nin India and UPPCL has requested to examine if some practical, locally based solutions can be \npilot tested. \n \n4.  The innovativeness of this component is that it will develop and pilot test solutions that \nimprove the bill collection efficiency for the utility, while at the same time, improve community \nengagement, through smart devices such as smart phone-based payment applications and \nmonitoring tools. This will contribute to the economic welfare of people through new income \noptions and empower women at the same time.  \n \n5.  It is expected that the innovative bill collection mechanisms will embody the following \nelements: \n(i)  engagement of local community members/representatives, specifically in rural \nareas by working with village enterprises or facilitation centers to manage meter \nreading, billing, and collections at the feeder level, linking it to an incentive-based \npayment for each activity undertaken per household; and \n(ii)  engagement of women\u2019s self-help groups (SHGs), including additional activities \nsuch  as  breakdown  management,  streetlights  maintenance,  etc.,  thereby \nimproving response time to correct faults and breakdowns in supply, and check \nlocal cases of theft more effectively.  ", "  2 \n \n6.  This output includes piloting four innovative bill collection mechanisms through active \nengagement of women, supported with behavioral change campaigns to raise awareness on \nenergy saving. \n  \n(i)  Appointment of a franchisee which can be a local community-based organization \nsuch  as  women\u2019s  self-help  groups,  cooperative  societies,  village  electricity \ncommittees and individual entrepreneurs, for bill collection in a given area, which \ncan be paid on the basis of collection efficiency achieved. This measure will also \nincrease the income of these institutions. \n(ii)  Enabling  digital  payment  through  avenues  like  banks, credit cards,  mobile \npayment, etc., to improve the ease of payment. For the electricity bill payers, these \noptions are convenient, cost effective and time saving. Proposed interventions \ninclude  educating  local  communities  about  these  options,  bringing  a  shift  in \nconsumers\u2019 habit of making bill payment as well as facilitating bank linkages, \nthrough local women, men, and institutions. \n(iii)  Flexible payment plans that include alternative payment options aligned with \npeople\u2019s affordability and income cycles, to be ascertained through a baseline \nassessment. Possible options include (a) Spot collection of electricity bill by local \ncommunity  representatives,  including  women,  young  men  and  women,  local \nleaders etc., who are appointed as meter readers. After bill collection, the status \ncan be updated in the same spot billing meters; (b) Annual plan, based on the \nprevious year\u2019s consumption, including possible discounts; and (c) part payment \nplan, for low value defaulters, having difficulty in paying lumpsum amount, can be \ngiven an option to pay partial bill amount and in installments. \n(iv)  Targeted approaches including selective prepaid metering or part payment option \nfor low value defaulters, who are identified using data analytic tools; and regular \nreach to high value defaulters to ensure timely payment, possibly through sending \nSMS at regular intervals, app notifications, etc. \n \n7.  The  proposed  bill  collection  mechanisms  to  be  piloted  consist  of  the  following \norganizations already active in targeted villages: \n \n(i)  women\u2019s self-help groups (SHG) that are already active in the targeted villages \nand set up under the National Rural Livelihood Mission; \n(ii)  village based common service centers (CSC) that are being established by the \ngovernment to provide number of services to rural households under Digital India \nProgram; \n(iii)  public distribution shops (PDS) that have been established to distribute public \nrations to act as the collection agents; \n(iv)  primary  agricultural  cooperative  societies  (PACS)  as  collection  agents  from \nagriculture consumers for use of electricity in tube wells; and \n(v)  rural women from the communities will be engaged as community-based collection \nagents  to  collect  the  electricity  bills  on  weekly  basis  and  different  incentive \nstructures  and  monitoring  mechanisms  will  be  developed.  The  monitoring  of \ncollection mechanism and accounting for weekly collections will be facilitated \nthrough mobile phone applications that can be used by rural women.  \n \n8.  The consultants are required to undertake the following tasks: \n \n(i)   undertake  a  baseline  assessment  survey  in  two  districts  with  low  collection \nefficiency to identify target habitations for the pilots, estimate the present level of \nbill  collection  efficiency  and  ascertain  the  current  knowledge,  attitudes  and ", "3 \npractices related to bill payment, affordability, main barriers to regular electricity \nbill payment.  The survey should include at least 10 villages and at least 5,000 \nrespondents.  \n(ii)   based on the survey results, identify possible partner organizations and groups \nbelonging to women\u2019s SHGs, CSCs, PDS and PACS active in the two selected \ndistricts;  \n(iii)   develop an incentive-based mechanism to engage these organizations to act as \nthe collection agents on behalf of the concerned distribution company (DISCOM); \nundertake  consultations  with  DISCOM  officials  and  potential  partners \norganizations  and  finalize  the  incentive  structure  and  the  implementation \narrangements; \n(iv)   design partnership agreement to engage these entities as collection agents with \nclearly  demarcated  roles,  responsibilities,  incentives,  and  penalties  for  under \nperformance; \n(v)   prepare an objective selection criterion for engaging partners organizations from \nthe four different types of organizations (i.e. women\u2019s SHGs, CSC, PDS and \nPACS.) \n(vi)   finalize the selection of partner organizations in consultation with the relevant \nDISCOM officials. This should consist of at least 500 organizations including 300 \nwomen\u2019s SHGs; \n(vii)   undertake  extensive  tailored  training  for  different  types  of  organizations  and \nprepare implementing guidelines for pilot testing the bill collection initiative. At least \n1,000 individuals including at least 300 women from women\u2019s SHGs and other 200 \nwomen working in CSCs, PDSs and PACS trained in new bill collection methods; \n(viii)   undertaking awareness campaigns in the selected districts on safe and efficient \nuse of electricity targeting rural women.  The consultants are required to record \nbefore and after surveys of a representative sample of beneficiaries to assess the \neffectiveness of this intervention; \n(ix)   design an IT based system to integrate the bill collection agents with the billing \nsoftware of DISCOM. The IT system should also be capable of tracking the \nperformance of each organizations engaged as bill collection agents and should \nhave different modules for the different types of collection agents; \n(x)   closely monitor the performance of the collection agents and pilot initiative of \nengaging community-based collection agents; prepare monthly monitoring reports \nand  propose  revisions  to  the  implementation  arrangements  if  required  after \nconsulting DISCOM officials; \n(xi)   after the 12 months pilot testing phase, prepare a comprehensive review of the \npilot testing, assessing the performance of each agent and different types of \nagents as a group.  The consultant is expected to make recommendation on \nwhether  to  scale  up  the  pilot  initiative  including  recommendations  to \nimplementation guidelines to address any shortcoming observed during the pilot \ntesting phase; \n(xii)   in the final report the consultants are required to propose a detailed strategy for \nscaling up the pilot initiative including detailed implementation guidelines.  \n \nB.  Output 2: Gender responsive human resource policies and measures for contract \nworkers and regular staff developed and piloted \n \n9.  This will assist UPPPCL and their contractors to improve their organizational policies in \ncompliance with government gender equality laws and their employee attitudes, to encourage \nfemale participation in the workforce. UPPPCL will carry out institutional assessment of HR \npolicies and practices relating to recruitment and staff development, work/life policies, sexual ", "  4 \n \nharassment and discrimination policies, and gender-friendly work environment in UPPCL. Based \non the above, a package of gender-responsive employment practices for UPPCL and contractors \nemployed by UPPCL will be developed. \n \n10.  The consultants are required to undertake following tasks. \n \n(i)   selection of contractors (10) based on pre-decided qualifying criteria (size, number \nof employees engaged, type of tasks discharged, willingness to participate etc.); \n(ii)   baseline assessment carried out for the select 10 contractors to understand the \nexisting HR policies, employee base, type of occupations for women employee, \ntrends and attitudes;  \n(iii)   development of a package of interventions for contractors that includes (a) gender \nand social inclusion capacity building; (b) guidelines for gender responsive HR \npolicies; and (c) steps to enhance employability of women in various functions;  \n(iv)   identification of trainers from within UPPCL, Madhyanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. \n(MVVNL) and Purvanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. (PuVVNL) and development of \ntraining modules for skill development training on utility related functions such as \nmeter reading; and 500 poor people (200 women) trained in UPPCL related skills, \nincluding meter reading, regular operations and maintenance (O&M); \n(v)   based on pre-decided criteria and in consultation with the contractors, selection \nand training of 500 poor people (200 women) to take up employment as meter \nreaders, or in any other capacities with the utility; \n(vi)   institutional assessment of HR policies and practices relating to recruitment and \nstaff  development,  work/life  policies,  sexual  harassment,  and  discrimination \npolicies;  gender-friendly  work  environment,  in  UPPCL,  MVVNL  and \nPaschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. (PUVVNL); \n(vii)   based on the above, designing of a package of gender-responsive policies and \npractices  to  improve  the  employment  prospects  for  women  in  the  three \norganizations; \n(viii)   designing  a  socially  and  gender-inclusive  training  module  for  UPPCL  staff, \nincluding communication materials, models, guidance notes on gender awareness \nin the energy sector; and \n(ix)   training of 100 UPPCL staff on addressing poverty, gender, and social issues in \ntheir operations. \n \nIII.
