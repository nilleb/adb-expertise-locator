THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Public Efficiency and Financial Markets Program, and (ii) a \nproposed policy-based loan to Armenia for subprogram 1 of the Public Efficiency and Financial \nMarkets Program. \n \n2.  The  proposed  program  aims  to  strengthen  fiscal  sustainability  and  support  the \ndevelopment of financial markets in Armenia. Sound public debt and fiscal risk management is \nnecessary to ensure that the government\u2019s borrowing program is sustainable and that fiscal risks \nare managed to deliver predictable fiscal outcomes consistent with macroeconomic policies. Well-\nfunctioning financial markets are essential to support (i) the expansion of government borrowing \nin the domestic market and to reduce the government\u2019s foreign currency exposure, and (ii) the \nefficient  conduct  of  monetary  policy  and  to  provide  suitable  mechanisms  to  address \nmacroeconomic shocks and other financial stability risks. The programmatic approach will support \ntwo subprograms for implementation during 2017\u20132018.1 A transaction technical assistance (TA) \nwill facilitate program preparation and implementation.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Economic context. The economic contraction in the Russian Federation continued to be \na drag on Armenia's economic performance in 2016, through finance, trade, and remittance \nchannels. Armenia\u2019s economic growth slowed substantially to 0.2% in 2016 from 3.2% in 2015. \nThe expansionary fiscal policy to counter the negative pressures stemming from the external \nenvironment together with deflationary and weak economic growth, led to widening of the fiscal \ndeficit to 5.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016 from 4.8% in 2015 and to further debt \naccumulation to 56.6% of GDP from 48.7% in 2015. This fiscal position and the prevalence of \nforeign  currency  public  debt  pose  a  significant  source  of  risk  exposure  of  public  debt  to \nmovements in the exchange rate. Armenia faces the challenge of being fiscally responsible \nagainst a backdrop of slowing economic growth and a limited scope of further spending cuts. With \nthe regional slowdown (e.g. Russian Federation) and total public debt exceeding legal limits, the \nnext round of fiscal consolidation will have to be based on domestic revenue mobilization and \npublic spending efficiency.3 \n \n4.  Development  problem.  The  current  economic  slowdown  adversely  affects  the \nperformance of the finance sector and capital market activity. High financial dollarization of both \nloans and deposits (around 60%), resulting from the aftermath of the global financial crisis in \n2009-2010 and exchange rate instability in 2014, limited the mobilization of long-term local \ncurrency financing for investment in the economy. The deepening of the domestic financial \nmarkets and increased financial intermediation in local currency is, therefore, essential.4 The core \n                                                \n1  The program was initially called Financial Sector Strengthening Program, Subprogram 1, and is included in Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Armenia, 2017\u20132019. Manila; and ADB. 2014. \nCountry Partnership Strategy: Armenia, 2014\u20132018. Manila. \n2  ADB provided transaction technical assistance for Support to Public Efficiency and Financial Markets Program (TA \n9332-ARM). \n3  When the debt-to-GDP ratio is above 50%, the public debt law stipulates a fiscal rule must be enforced that requires \nthe budget deficit to be reduced as per a specific formula. For 2017, the fiscal rule requires the budget deficit to be \nreduced by approximately 3% of GDP of its 2016 level. \n4  The deepening of the financial markets is supported by (i) stable macroeconomic policies; (ii) a clear debt \nmanagement strategy and management program to attract investors; (iii) stable fiscal and monetary policies to tackle ", "2 \ndevelopment  problem  that  the  program  aims  to  address  is  rooted  in  three  dimensional \ninterconnected constraints: (i) public debt and fiscal risk management that needs to be more \ncredible, transparent, and effective; (ii) challenges and institutional and infrastructure gaps that \nconstrain the development of Armenia\u2019s government securities and money markets; and (iii) the \nlack of instruments and corporate governance practices that impedes the broadening of the \ninvestor base in Armenia\u2019s corporate debt markets. \n \n5.  Public debt and fiscal sustainability. As Armenia moves to a middle-income country, it \nno longer can access concessional financing easily and increasingly will have to rely on mobilizing \ndebt  from  capital  markets,  especially  from  domestic  markets.  A  transition  from  external, \npredominantly  concessional,  sources  of  finance  to  local  currency-denominated  government \nsecurities (currently 20%) is required over the medium term. A prudent and effective debt \nmanagement policy is needed to ensure that, during this transition, the financing needs of the \ngovernment continue to be met at a minimum cost, but balanced against the need to develop the \ndomestic debt market and reduce foreign exchange risk exposures. In this regard, fundamental \nupgrades are necessary. For example, the Debt Management Department of the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) has functioned without complete documented procedures and controls, or a risk \nmanagement framework to manage its operational risk exposures. Security of the information \nsystem has also been inadequate to protect the integrity of the data, and systems backup and \nbusiness continuity arrangements are incomplete. \n \n6.  In  Armenia,  the  management  of  fiscal  risk-incurring  activities  is  fragmented  across \nministries. This leads to the inconsistent treatment of risk exposures and costly inefficiencies in \nterms of vetting. The absence of a centralized approach to fiscal risk management implies that \nlikely  operational  losses  and  contingent  liabilities  of  existing  and  future  fiscal  expenditure \ninitiatives are not understood or known, and hence, not well vetted, measured, or monitored by \nthe  government.  For  example,  credit  risk  assessments  and  the  monitoring  of  government \nonlending to state-owned enterprises, budgetary lending, and guarantees are inconsistent, not \nwell structured, and fail to price the risk that the government is taking on. The government is \nincreasingly promoting the use of public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) for the provision of public \nservices and infrastructure. However, there are no well-defined methodologies or procedures to \neffectively solicit, compare, and vet PPP proposals in terms of costs, quality, and risks. Legal risks \nalso must be considered as PPPs imply future fiscal commitments which should be reflected in \nthe PPP contract structure.5 \n \n7.  Government securities and financial market infrastructure. High dollarization is a \nfundamental constraint to private sector borrowers and the government in terms of access to \naffordable funding at manageable risk levels. The underdeveloped local currency debt markets \nalso  contribute  to  macroeconomic  and  financial  stability  risks.6 The  nascent  stage  of  the \ngovernment securities market and the lack of instruments and institutional mechanisms for \n                                                \nexternal shocks and ensure financial stability; (iv) financial infrastructure to support efficient, transparent, and low-\nrisk trading settlement and custody of securities, and availability of suitable financial instruments; (v) strong legal and \ninstitutional environment to protect borrowers, creditor, and investor rights, and public disclosure practices; and (vi) \nsequencing in market development. For example, government securities and money markets support development \nof the private debt and equity markets. International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2014. The Development of Local Capital \nMarkets: Rationale and Challenges. Washington, DC. \n5  PPP contracts can have direct liabilities (e.g., fixed payments), contingent liabilities (e.g., payments if a risk occurs), \nand implicit service delivery risks to the government. \n6  Dollarization of bank assets and liabilities exposes banks to foreign exchange and refinancing risks. With limited \nmarket activity in local currency, both fiscal and monetary policies have little impact on addressing external \nmacroeconomic shocks and to supporting finance sector stability. The role of the exchange rate remains a core \nmacroeconomic and financial stability concern when external shocks occur. \n ", "3 \nsecured interbank trading also impede a more active money market. The stimulation of financial \nmarkets requires the public debt issuance program to be transparent, predictable, and strategic \nin the maturities targeted and gradually build pricing benchmarks in different debt maturities while \nstimulating trading activity. Such approach would accommodate the government\u2019s financing \nneeds while still keeping currency, interest, and refinancing risks at manageable levels. The \nappropriate structuring of public debt issuances is important for (i) developing the government \nsecurities  market,  so  that  it  can  become  more  liquid  at  key  tenors;  (ii)  providing  low-risk \nopportunities for retail investors to buy and sell government securities; and (iii) the creation of \nmarket-based pricing and reliable pricing benchmarks for private debt and equity markets to use \nas reference rates. \n \n8.  Armenia\u2019s  money  markets  are  underdeveloped,  illiquid,  and  do  not  support  the \ndevelopment  of  active  secondary  debt  markets  through  which  efficient  cash  and  liquidity \nmanagement could be achieved. Secured interbank trading is shallow, while unsecured trading \nis minimal as the perceived counterparty risks in the banking sector remain high. Promoting less \ncredit-intensive  products  such  as  repurchase  agreements  (\u201crepos\u201d),  and  an  efficient  liquid \nsecondary market for treasury bills will mitigate credit risk and be a step forward for stimulating \ntrading activity in the money market. Development of the repo market is hindered by (i) the short \nsupply of marketable securities qualified as collateral; (ii) the absence of standardized contractual \nterms; and (iii) manual transaction settlements, which involve high transaction and monitoring \ncosts. Stimulating money market activity is vital to deepen the yield curve and promote capital \nmarket development. The Armenian authorities recognize the importance of developing financial \nmarkets and have established a steering committee for capital market development and a task \nforce for financial market development. However, the mandate of the two bodies needs to be \nclarified and coordination mechanisms need to be established to support effective sequencing \nand direction for financial market development. \n \n9.  Investor base and corporate financial transparency. There are only a few institutional \ninvestors in Armenia, such as pension funds and insurance companies, that invest in the domestic \ncapital market. There is a dearth of domestic retail investors who are able to trade small quantities \nof shares. This is because of a lack of retail access outside Yerevan and the absence of low-cost \ninternet trading facilities that lower the transaction costs for small-volume trading. More generally, \nthe absence of effective consumer and investor protection also undermines retail investments. \nDue to historically low corporate transparency, there is a general mistrust in the reliability of \ncompanies\u2019 audited accounts. This reflects deficiencies in the legal framework for sound corporate \ngovernance practices such as financial information transparency and the oversight of accounting \nand audit practitioners. This makes it difficult for investors to assess the incidence and magnitude \nof Armenian corporate risk. Weak corporate governance and a lack of complete and reliable \nfinancial information on domestic companies dissuade investors from actively participating in \nprivate financial markets. Strengthening the legal framework to protect consumers and investors, \nimproving corporate governance, and introducing new types of securities will broaden the investor \nbase and facilitate new investment opportunities for local and foreign investors, and make the \nfinance sector more diversified. \n \n10.  Government\u2019s reform agenda. Armenia\u2019s long-term development vision, as articulated \nin the Armenia Development Strategy, 2025, prioritizes modernizing public administration and \ngovernance, and the development of money and capital markets.7 The Central Bank of Armenia \n(CBA) is promoting money and capital markets and introducing good international practice to \n                                                \n7  Government of Armenia. 2014.

The government will implement an \nissuance program to promote liquid benchmark securities to establish a reliable local currency \nyield curve. Complementary reforms will strengthen the primary dealer system to increase trading \nactivity and liquidity. \n \n11.  Programmatic approach. Fiscal and finance sector reforms require a long-term horizon  \nto ensure sustainability. It is critical that the reforms are identified properly and are well sequenced \nover subsequent subprograms for effective implementation.9 A programmatic approach provides \nthe  necessary  flexibility  and  facilitates  chronological  sequencing  while  explicitly  stating  the \nobjectives and policy actions. The programmatic approach also allows adjustments to policy \naction objectives in response to changing realities and exogenous shocks. The program can \nleverage and help coordinate assistance provided by donors. Under subprogram 1, the program \ninitially concentrates on improving systems, strengthening capacity, and providing an enabling \nenvironment under subprogram 1. Subprogram 2 implements these initiatives leading to a more \nstable and reliable yield curve and a better grasp on fiscal risks. \n \n12.  Development  partner  coordination. The  program  helps coordinate  the  benefits  of \ndifferent sources of TA for fiscal and finance sector reforms in Armenia. Different aspects in the \nscope of the program have been closely coordinated with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \nthe World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the European \nUnion (EU) delegation in Armenia. This has ensured that proposed program reforms complement \nrelated (past or present) TA initiatives by other development partners, and that each partner\u2019s \nwork is considered, integrated, and made part of the policy dialogue. IMF has established a fiscal \nrisk division in MOF and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) program builds the fiscal risk \nmanagement  capacity  of  MOF  and  operationalizes  the  division  of  responsibilities  by  risk \nmanagement functions.10 The program builds on the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment\u2019s ongoing support for developing local currency money markets, and expands the \nscope of that reform effort through key linkages to public debt management and issuance \nstrategies. The program also leverages the EU\u2019s ongoing TA aimed at approximating the legal \nframework for public debt management operations to EU practices and adds to its TA advisory \nobjectives of promoting the deepening of the domestic financial market. \n \n13.  Lessons. The program incorporates important lessons from the ongoing policy dialogue \nand from experience in finance sector and public sector reform programs in other countries, as \nwell as from parallel ADB programmatic engagement in Armenia.11 Policy reforms must be \naccompanied by significant government ownership, which in this program are demonstrated by \nthe government\u2019s clear reform priorities (supported by its development partners). In addition, \nsetting realistic policy actions is critical to ensure that the reform program can be carried out \neffectively. The reforms of this program also affect the private sector; hence, broad consultations \nwith the private sector were carried out, helping to refine the policy actions. International lessons \nfor the successful development of local currency financial markets emphasize several crucial \nfactors: (i) sound macroeconomic policies and debt management strategies; (ii) a diversified \ninvestor base; (iii) a sound legal framework; and (iv) modern, reliable, and efficient infrastructure.12 \nThe program addresses all these reform areas to varying degrees.  \n                                                \n8  CBA. 2014.

ADB is recognized to be able to mobilize strong expertise in \nfinancial market development and public sector management to the benefit of its clients. ADB\u2019s \ntrack record of engagement in Armenia and other developing countries adds significant value to \nthe proposed programmatic intervention, by (i) enhancing the coordination with development \npartners during the design and execution of the program, (ii) assisting to jointly conceptualize and \nimplement policy measures with the government, and (iii) mitigating risk-aversion by some policy \nmakers  regarding  the  most  challenging  reform  processes  required  ahead.  The  interim \nassessments that the ADB team used to drive the policy dialog forward\u2014technical and guidance \nnotes that were instrumental in contextualizing policy actions, building ownership, and agreeing \non the future direction\u2014also benefited from previous work by other finance sector stakeholders \n(including development partners). The program is focusing on money and government debt \nmarket reforms but it also supports the government\u2019s finance sector development agenda, by (i) \nstimulating the local capital markets, enabling companies and households increased access to \nlocal-currency borrowing; and (ii) helping to reduce dollarization and related foreign currency risks \nof public and private borrowers. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The program is aligned with the following impact: increased fiscal sustainability and \nresilience in the finance sector of Armenia by 2020. The program will have the following outcome: \nincreased depth of financial markets in Armenia.13 Subprogram 1 includes 25 actions (expected \ncompliance by end October 2017), and Subprogram 2 includes 26 actions (expected before end-\nAugust 2018). \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n16.  Output 1: Strengthened public debt and fiscal risk management policies to enhance \nfiscal  discipline  and  transparency.  This  output  will  improve  the  government\u2019s  debt \nmanagement practices by strengthening the legal framework, improving analytical capacity of the \nPublic  Debt  Management  Department  (PDMD),  particularly  in  its  middle-office  functions, \nmitigating system risks, introducing more clarity and transparency in PDMD\u2019s internal procedures, \noperations, and debt issuance decisions, being more transparent on the government\u2019s debt \nmanagement objectives over the medium term, and introducing an operational risk management \nframework. Subprogram 1 has established (i) procedures to formalize PDMD\u2019s role in all debt \nissuance processes of the government and an action plan to add staff, systems, and resources \nfor an effective performance of crucial risk management functions; (ii) flexibility for PDMD to seize \nmarket demand opportunities (i.e., reopening of past Treasury bill issuances); and (iii) the \nrequirement for annual public disclosure of its debt sustainability outlook. Subprogram 2 will \nevaluate options to further a more holistic approach to debt analysis and reporting in the context \nof the medium-term debt strategy, and establish both a framework to govern the decision-making \nprocess regarding external borrowing and issuance of guarantees (ensuring that cost-at-risk \nanalyses are undertaken), and a manual to regulate decisions and the contracting of external \nloans. Subprogram 1 helped the government develop a PPP policy (approval is expected by end-\nOctober, 2017). Subprogram 2 will establish a new PPP law and help build the necessary \ncapacities and decision processes within the government to promote, vet, manage, and execute \nPPPs. The program will also strengthen and expand the government\u2019s management of PPP-\nrelated fiscal risks, within a broad effort to develop the fiscal risk management capacity of MOF. \nSubprogram 1 established a road map to operationalize the division of responsibilities in MOF by \nsources of risk and risk-management functions. Subprogram 2 will approve a formal, integrated \n                                                \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n ", "6 \nframework  for  fiscal  risk  management,  and  initiate  its  reporting  within  the  medium-term \nexpenditure framework cycle. \n \n17.  Output 2: Improved government securities market and money-market infrastructure \nto finance the budget and develop financial markets in dram. This output will increase trading \nvolumes and liquidity in government securities and support the gradual reduction of foreign \ncurrency risk exposures by public and corporate borrowers and lenders. These reforms represent \nkey prerequisites to developing reliable risk-free benchmarks for local currency financial contracts. \nSubprogram 1 established instruments for a more  market development-friendly public debt \nissuance  program  and  started  the  implementation  of  key  institutional  and  technological \ninfrastructure for money markets. Under subprogram 1, MOF initiated the consolidation of debt \nissuances into benchmark-quality issues through higher issuance limits and organizing the \nreopening of past issuances. MOF has also increased the frequency of debt auctions by initiating \na Regular Treasury Bill Program, which enhances liquidity and price discovery. The Regular \nTreasury Bill Program, with a constant supply of short-term Treasury bills issued in sufficient \nvolume, will increase depth in short tenors and the frequency of pricing points in the risk-free \nbenchmark curve.14 A streamlined Regular Treasury Bill Program and more effective repos will \npromote the active and efficient use of Treasury bills and repos for cash and liquidity management. \nSubprogram 2 will establish a clear policy on its bond buyback and switch operations to increase \nmarket's understanding of PDMD\u2019s debt management strategy and operational objectives. A more \neffective  primary  dealers\u2019  system  was  established  in  subprogram  1,  with  market-making \nresponsibilities to promote price discovery and liquidity in the government securities market. \nAccess to public debt issuance for retail investors has been enhanced using mobile technology. \n \n18.  This output will also enhance money market infrastructure and secured transactions. \nSubprogram 1 established the legal framework for secured interbank transactions by passing a \nnumber of key legal amendments pertaining to derivatives and repo instruments, insolvency, civil \nprocedures, arbitration, and tax incentives.15 Further work will be done on secondary regulation \nand supporting trading systems by introducing standard repo documentation based on the \nGeneral Masters Repos Agreement as well as put in place an electronic settlement system for \nrepos and a derivatives repository. Subprogram 1 introduced in the policy dialogue the need to \ngradually reduce foreign currency risk exposures in public debt issuance by focusing on domestic \ndebt issuance in the medium-term public debt strategy. A dedicated working group has been \nestablished  to  investigate  options,  and  subprogram  2  will  produce  conclusions  on  how  to \naccelerate this transition. \n \n19.  Output 3: Broadened base of instruments and investors, and enhanced corporate \ntransparency to increase mobilization of private investment. This output will strengthen the \nlegal and regulatory framework for new instruments and for corporate transparency in Armenia to \n                                                \n14 Under the Regular Treasury Bill Program, 91-, 180-, and 365-day Treasury bills are issued in regular fixed volumes, \nwhich provide investors with a regular supply of short-term Treasury bills in sufficient volumes to meet demand for a \nshort-term, low-risk liquid instrument and support the secondary market. \n15 A number of key legal amendments were passed to ensure that derivatives and repo instruments (i) are properly \ndefined in law (amendment to Law on Securities Market, e.g., specifying the difference and the requirements for \nstandardized and OTC derivatives); (ii) benefit from indisputable enforceability (amendments to laws on insolvency \nprovided for, e.g., effective operation of close-out netting in insolvency; amendments to the civil code lifted such \nrequirements as notarization, notice, etc.; amendments to the Law on Arbitration facilitated the enforcement of arbitral \nawards as well as interim measures); (iii) can be under foreign law and arbitration (amendments to Law on Securities \nMarkets provided for local parties to choose the applicable law in the case of standardized derivatives contracts, i.e., \nInternational Swaps and Derivatives Association MA and ICMA General Masters Repos Agreement). Also, tax \nincentives were approved to incentivize filing with the Derivatives Trade Repository (e.g., losses from derivative \ntransactions will only be deductible if the transaction was duly reported to the Derivatives Trade Repository). \n ", "7 \nencourage  more  active  investors  and  issuers,  and  develop  the  capital  markets.  Under \nsubprogram 1, the CBA submitted to the Parliament a Residential Mortgage Lending Law draft \nand amendments to the Covered Bonds Law. Under subprogram 2, the amendments will be \napproved by the Parliament and the CBA will propose amendments to the Securitization Law to \nclarify the nature and attributes of new investment instruments. To increase resource mobilization \nusing private equity funds, subprogram 1 supported regulatory changes to enable private equity \ninvestment  vehicles  to  have  their  subscribed  capital  denominated  in  US  dollars.16 Under \nsubprogram 2, the government will introduce elements of modern corporate law such as the \nconcept of a shareholder\u2019s agreement. Stronger corporate transparency practices and availability \nof complete and reliable financial information on domestic companies through these policy actions \nwill likely attract investors and channel savings to companies that need capital to grow and \ngenerate jobs. To strengthen accounting and auditing practices, under subprogram 1, MOF \ninitiated  legal  reforms  to  progressively  increase  accounting  standards  and  external  audit \nrequirements for private companies. Under subprogram 2, these audit reforms will be further \nadvanced by including the establishment of a public oversight board with regulatory and oversight \nfunctions on audit. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n20.  Low economic growth, deflation, and expansionary fiscal policy put pressure on the \ngovernment budget in 2016, causing the budget deficit to widen to 5.5% of GDP from 4.8% in \n2015. Higher borrowing for infrastructure development and financing the budget deficit raised the \nratio of public debt to 56.6% of GDP at the end of 2016 from 48.7% a year earlier. External public \ndebt increased to 45.8% of GDP from 41.4% in 2015, while domestic debt rose to 10.8% from \n7.3% in 2016. To reduce debt-related vulnerabilities and contain fiscal risks, the government \nenvisages significant fiscal consolidation in 2017, mainly through cuts in capital spending and \nmeasures to contain public wages and pensions. With public debt exceeding the legal limit of 50% \nof GDP, Armenia\u2019s fiscal rule requires the government to reduce the budget deficit from 5.5% in \n2016 to 2.8% in 2017. Over the medium term, the budget deficit is expected to narrow to 2.7% of \nGDP in 2018 and to 2.4% of GDP in 2019. \n \n21.  The government has requested a loan of $40 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \n(OCR) to help finance subprogram 1. The loan amount reflects the government\u2019s financing needs, \nand the strength and development impact of the proposed policy reforms. The loan will have a \n15-year term including a 3-year grace period, (e.g. annuity method based on 10% discount factor, \nstraight line, etc.), an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based loan lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and \nsuch other terms and conditions as will be set forth in the OCR loan agreement. Based on this, \nthe average loan maturity is 9.25 years and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The \nclosing date of the loan is 31 December 2017. The loan will be disbursed in a single tranche.  \n \n                                                \n16 In December 2016, the CBA adopted an official interpretation that allows nonpublic contractual funds that have \nregistered through a special NASDAQ OMX platform to denominate their fund units in freely convertible currencies. \nThe policy rationale behind this was twofold: (i) even though ultimate corporate investments of these funds are in \nArmenia and in dram, interested investors still prefer the use of conduits in legal jurisdictions with strong investor \nprotection that can flexibly process dividends and payments on freely convertible currencies; and (ii) nonpublic funds \ndo not attract funds from the general public, so the foreign exchange risks in these contractual funds are more \nmanageable to the type of investors targeted and will have no systemic impact in the Armenian economy. Further, \nonly contractual funds may benefit from this regulation, since all corporate entities, including corporate funds, are \nprohibited from attracting capital in any currency except dram. \n ", "8 \n22.  The loan size is justified considering the government\u2019s development expenditure and \nfinancing needs spread over 2017\u20142019 (Table 1). The government\u2019s financing needs in 2017 \nare projected to be $561.7 million with overall already-secured financing at $367.1 million. The \nfinancing gap (i.e., the difference between financing needs, excluding domestic debt and available \nfinancing) is expected to be $194.6 or 1.7% of GDP in 2017, which will be financed partly through \nsubprogram 1. The expected amount for Subprogram 2 is $50 million. \n \nTable 1: Armenia State Budget Financing Gap for 2017\u20132019 (Projected) \nAmount  Amount  Amount  GDP  GDP  GDP \n2017  2018  2019  2017  2018  2019 \nItem  ($ million)  ($ million)  ($ million)  (%)  (%)  (%) \n1.

MOF will be the executing agency. CBA and MOF will be implementing agencies in their \nrespective reforms in each output (see policy matrix). MOF has been the executing agency in \nprior program loans. Both MOF and CBA have a well-established track record of implementing \nreform  programs  with  ADB,  the World  Bank,  and  the  IMF.

In addition, the program supports reforms that produce sizable direct financial \nbenefits.

Governance \n25.  The government has been reforming its public financial management system through the \nintroduction of program budgeting. The full rollout of program budgeting will improve expenditure \npriorities, enhance public financial management efficiency, and enhance the assessment of \nexpenditure results against policy objectives. The full rollout is expected to be completed in time \nfor the 2019 budget. Though this will be a significant achievement, the public expenditure and \nfinancial  accountability  assessment  identified  weaknesses  in  fiscal  discipline,  allocation  of \nresources, and cost-effective service delivery.18 In 2011, procurement was decentralized to line \nagencies to improve procurement effectiveness by aligning procurement processes to specific \nneeds, increasing transparency, which, in turn, should lead to better procurement outcomes. MOF \nstill  has  an  oversight  role,  and  has  introduced  additional  reforms  such  as  establishing  a \nprocurement appeals council, and publishing all information related to procurement, including \nprocurement  contracts.  The  government\u2019s  Anticorruption  Council  is  responsible  for  setting \nanticorruption  policies,  leading  investigations,  and  imposing  remedies.  However,  the \nAnticorruption Council appears ineffective as it does not meet regularly and has not produced \nsignificant recommendations for reform. \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOF. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n27.  The program is expected to contribute indirectly to poverty reduction as policy reforms are \nexpected to have indirect medium- and long-term impacts on poverty, mainly through improved \nfinance sector stability, stronger resilience against external shocks, and higher economic growth \nand employment opportunities. Program reforms will help (i) strengthen public debt and fiscal risk \nmanagement and support the government\u2019s fiscal consolidation efforts, which will create fiscal \nspace for public spending on priority sectors; (ii) improve financial market infrastructure, which \nsupports the government\u2019s objective of generating additional investment opportunities in the \neconomy and, thus, achieving sustainable economic growth; and (iii) enhance the investor base \nand corporate transparency, laying the foundations of corporate market development and, thus, \nreorienting the economy toward investment-driven activities. The proposed reforms will also \ncreate the necessary preconditions for improving the country\u2019s competitiveness and promoting \nlong-term inclusive growth. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n28.  In line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified as \ncategory C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE.

Armenia\u2019s economic performance \n \nWith unfavorable external conditions and subdued domestic demand, economic \ngrowth slowed sharply to 0.2% in 2016 from 3.2% in 2015. On the supply side, declines in \nagriculture  and  construction  were  the  main  causes  for  the  slowdown,  while  services, \nmanufacturing and mining expanded. On the demand side, growth came mainly from a rise in \ntotal consumption and a further narrowing of the deficit in net exports of goods and services. \nPrivate  consumption grew  by  a  modest  1.0%,  reflecting  weak  household  spending.  Public \nconsumption grew by an 4.2% due to an expansionary fiscal policy geared toward supporting \ngrowth.  \n \nWeak aggregate demand and lower commodity prices caused consumer prices to \ndecline by 1.1% month-on-month in December 2016 and further suppressed growth. Lower \ninflationary pressures allowed the central bank to pursue an accommodative monetary policy, by \ngradually reducing the policy rate from 8.75% in December 2015 to 6.00% in February 2017.  \n \nThe weaker-than-expected economic growth, deflation, and expansionary fiscal \npolicy caused the deficit to widen further to 5.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) from \n4.8% in 2015 and 1.9% in 2014. The higher budget deficit pushed public debt to 56.7% of GDP \nat the end of 2016 from 48.8% a year earlier. External public debt increased to 45.9% of GDP \nfrom 41.5% in 2015, while domestic debt rose to 10.9%, up by 3.5%. According to the Debt \nSustainability Assessment, while public debt remains sustainable, risks are elevated. \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  15 \n \nB.  Public Finances \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubstantial progress has been made by the Government of Armenia in improving  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nits public finances management systems and practices over the past years, as \nevidenced by various reviews, including the 2014 PEFA assessment.  \n \n ", "16  Appendix 3 \nWe continue to be fully committed to improving public financial management practices, \nincluding reducing systemic risks, strengthening public debt and fiscal risk management practices, \nand improving sustainability, transparency and predictability in our public finances.  \n \nIn the coming years, our fiscal policy will boost economic growth and gradually increase the \ngrowth potential in the economy. In the medium-term, fiscal policy will focus on reducing debt \nwhich is the most important precondition to assure a sustainable macroeconomic environment to \nsupport economic growth.  \n \nTo achieve the above-mentioned objectives the Government of Armenia program for 2017-2022, \nenvisages the following oublic finance actions:  \n \na)  To boost economic growth potential and ensure macroeconomic stability, the government \nplans to: \ni)  Improve public debt management and assure public debt sustainability by:  \n- introducing in 2017 a viable system of assessing the behavior of primary market \nparticipants in government treasury bonds; \n- introducing new fiscal rules in 2018 that will stabilize debt and not hinder economic \ngrowth. \nii)  Introducing a new toolkit in 2019 to comprehensively assess the impact of fiscal policy \non the economy; \niii)  Designing a budgetary framework in 2022 for the medium-term perspective, which  plans \nto gradualy increase capital expenditures, possibly moderating current expenditures and \nincreasing the efficiency of public expen diture to ensure social needs are met.   \n \nb)  To improve regulation of private sector accounting and external audit, the government plans \nto developa legislative package in 2018, and a sub-legislation in 2019 to implement the new \naccounting and auditing legal framework. \n \nc)  To raise the efficiency of public finance management system the government plans: \ni)  To expand the scope of clients using the e-procurement system to raise the level of \nefficiency and transparency in public procurement as well as to increase \ncompetitiveness. Specifically: \n- introducing the e-auction system for procurement in 2017; \n- introducing modern standards for e-management systems into the e-procurement \nsystem in 2018. \n- transferring into the e-procurement system the State non-commercial organizations, \nwhich have organized competitive bidding with a budget exceeding AMD 200 million \nin 2018; \n- transferring into the e-procurement system the communities, which have organized \ncompetitive bidding with a budget exceeding AMD 200 million in 2019; and \n- transferring into the e-procurement system community non-commercial organizations \nand organizations with more than 50% of community shares, which have organized \ncompetitive bidding with a budget exceeding AMD 200 million in 2020; \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  17 \nii)    To strengthen the \u201cvalue for money\u201d principle and introduce an efficient toolkit for public \naccountability, shift to quantitative and qualitative result based indicators for programs, \nfinanced from the state budget. Specifically: \n- complete the formulation of methodological base for program budgeting in 2017; \n- prepare the 2019 and out-years budgets and submit to the Parliament in the program \nbudgeting format. \n \nd)  To develop the financial markets and introduce a long-term pension savings, the government \nwill jointly undertake steps with the CBA to streamline the accumulated funds into the real \nsector  of  the  economy.  This will  stimulate  the  economy  and  increase  investment.  The \ngovernment will do this by: \ni)  developing a capital market development program that will promote issuance of \nshares and bonds by local companies in conjunction with the CBA in 2018;  \nii)  increase the accessibility of financial services by implementing necessary legal \nregulations in conjunction with the CBA in 2019; \niii)  expand the pension system and develop a medium-term development program for the \ninsurance market that will aim at introducing new insurance toolkits and life insurance \nsystem, in conjunction with the CBA in 2020.  \n \nC.  Financial and Capital Markets \n \nWe believe that a well-functioning financial and capital markets are essential for economic \ngrowth and job creation.
