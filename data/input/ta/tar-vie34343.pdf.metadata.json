INTRODUCTION\n1. The Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam has requested advisory technical\nassistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to prepare a Road Map for Power\nSector Reform. The TA Fact-Finding Mission, conducted from 21 to 29 May 2001, reached an\nunderstanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, financing plan, implementation\narrangements, and terms of reference of the TA. The TA will help the Government to identify the\nmajor issues involved in power sector reforms and to prepare a plan or road map to resolve\nthese in a progressive manner. These reforms are in line with the Country Assistance Plan for\nViet Nam (2001-2003) and the new Country Strategy and Program,1 which include support for\nreform of state-owned enterprises, for policy reforms that encourage more private investment,\nand for some public power projects. The TA is included in the 2001 TA Program for Viet Nam.2\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Government began restructuring the nation's power sector with the establishment of\nElectricity of Viet Nam (EVN) in 1995. EVN is a holding company with many units, which\noperate with limited managerial and financial autonomy. The Government also adopted a Power\nSector  Policy  in  December  1995,  which  included  objectives  for  developing  a  regulatory\nframework; including an electricity law; adopting cost-based tariffs; promoting private sector\nparticipation in power supply; increasing rural access to electricity; and undertaking demand-\nside management. The Government prepared an updated Power Sector Policy Statement in\nAugust  1997,  which  outlines  legal  and  regulatory  reforms  in  the  sector,  and  espouses  a\nprogressive evolution in the structure of the power sector as well as commercialization and\nimproved efficiency of the operating units. A high-level steering committee and a working group\nwere also established in 1997 to prepare an electricity law. The draft Electricity Law has been\nrevised and refined several times, and is now in its 14th draft. Draft decrees have also been\nprepared on various subjects under the Electricity Law. The Government approved a new\nDecree on Electricity Activities and Usage in August 2001, which provides rules for electricity\ndevelopment planning and investment, electricity production and transmission, power purchase\ncontracts and tariff setting, state management of electric activities, etc. The work on the new\nelectricity law and the associated regulatory framework has been supported by TA from both the\nWorld Bank and ADB.3 The Electricity Law will establish the legal foundation for transforming\nthe power sector into a more market-oriented structure. However, the law does not explicitly\ndefine the proposed new structure and market model for the power sector. It stipulates that\nelectricity suppliers are required to apply for separate licenses for generation, bulk supply sales,\ntransmission, distribution, and retail supply sales activities, but it allows considerable scope for\ndifferent power sector models under this general framework.\n3. The draft Electricity Law does not deal with transition and implementation issues. In the\nworldwide power sector reform experience, transition issues are recognized as one of the most\nimportant problem areas that need attention. To address the issues described above, another\nTA is required to prepare a \u201croad map\u201d for power sector reform, which will determine in more\n                  \n1  A new Country Strategy and Program is being finalized.\n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet version) on 11 June 2001.\n3  ADB has provided assistance through TA VIE 2888: Improvement of Power Sector Regulatory Framework, for\n$800,000, approved on 7 October 1997, and largely completed with the final report submitted in August 2000.\nUnder that TA, draft subsidiary legislation (decrees) and regulations were prepared for the operation of the planned\nElectricity Regulatory Commission, plus procedures for tariff setting and demand-side management. The World\nBank has provided TA on the drafting of the law itself. The decrees and the new law will be presented together to\nthe National Assembly for final approval, expected in late 2002.", "2\ndetail  the  most  appropriate  and  acceptable  new  framework  and  model  for  power  sector\noperations  in  Viet  Nam;  to  prepare  a  detailed  action  plan  to  implement  the  agreed  upon\nrestructuring; and to resolve transition issues. This will be the first road map for this sector.\n4. The TA will support several elements of ADB\u2019s new Country Strategy and Program for\nViet Nam. It will support the reform of state-owned enterprises; it will improve the accountability\nand governance of power sector management and operations; and the power sector reforms\nsupported by the TA will have indirect impacts on poverty reduction by improving the efficiency\nof power sector operations, which will eventually reduce tariffs, and by attracting more private\nlending and investment in the power sector, which will enable limited public sector financing to\nbe used in other social sectors with high impact on poverty reduction.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n5. The TA will help the Government to define a clear and more detailed vision of the\ndesired future power sector and market structure 5 and 10 years ahead, and to establish the\nsteps to accomplish the reform objectives and implement restructuring with specific timetables\nand responsibilities assigned. This will include the following actions: (i) review the Government\u2019s\nPower  Sector  Policy  Statement  of  1997,  and  update  and  expand  this  policy  paper  as\nappropriate; (ii) review and refine power sector reform objectives; (iii) prepare a management\nand organization model for the power sector in Viet Nam; (iv) identify the main problems and\nissues that need to be resolved regarding the planned structure and market model of the power\nsector in the near term and in the long term, and the roles of the Government, utilities (EVN and\npower companies), the private sector, and other industry stakeholders; and (v) prepare detailed\nprograms  and  preliminary  plans  (a  road  map)  to  resolve  these  issues  and  implement  the\nrestructuring, which include all the intermediate steps required to move from the current sector\nstructure to the desired future industry and market structure in a coherent, integrated manner.\nThe  road  map  must  recognize  that  power  sector  reform  should  be  based  on  gradual\ndevelopment of the sector through several intermediate stages of increasing complexity and\ncommercialization.  The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nB.  Scope\n6. The consultants under the TA will assist the Government with the preparation of a \u201croad\nmap\u201d to establish plans for power sector reform, and to implement these reforms. A number of\nproblems need to be resolved ultimately in this reform program, including the important ones\nand the tasks listed in Appendix 2. The TA scope does not provide for detailed and final plans to\nsolve each particular problem. Rather, the TA will prepare a road map containing a coordinated\nand systematic plan for addressing and resolving these problems. The TA will include the\nfollowing steps:\n(i)  Review the power sector reform objectives, and determine if revisions need to be\nmade.\n(ii)  Review the progress made to date in the planning and implementation of power\nsector reforms; and also review previous TAs on power sector reform in Viet\nNam and the progress made under them.\n(iii)  Determine the main reform tasks and transition issues that need to be addressed\nand solved in the near future, and in the longer term, in order to implement the\nreforms in an effective manner.", "3\n(iv)  Establish  priorities  in  addressing  these  problems,  and  prepare  a  detailed\nprogram to address and resolve these tasks in an integrated manner (the \u201croad\nmap\u201d).\n(v)  Prepare brief task reports for the important tasks that need to be resolved soon,\nwhich should include a description of options and alternative solutions, and a\nreview of international experience with similar reforms.  Conduct workshops to\ndiscuss the options, and reach consensus on the best solutions for Viet Nam.\n(vi)  Prepare descriptions of the scope and terms of reference for more detailed\nstudies on each of the major reform tasks.\n(vii)  Prepare a final report that summarizes the current policies and overall plans for\npower sector reform, and that describes the program of future work required to\naddress each of the major tasks and transition issues involved in the reform. The\nprogram, or road map, should describe time schedules for each task, various\nmilestones, who is responsible for each task, the interrelationships between the\ndifferent tasks, and the work required to complete each task.\n(viii)  Organize a seminar to present the final draft report of the TA with participation of\ninternational  experts,  representatives  from  ADB  and  the  World  Bank,  and\nconcerned Government officers.\n7. The consultants\u2019 first task will be to prepare an inception report with a detailed work plan\nfor conducting the TA. They will also prepare task reports on various subjects as required in\npara. 6 (v). They will conduct several workshops to discuss the reform program and to reach\nconsensus  on  the  overall  framework  for  reforms  and  the  road  map  to  implement  it.  The\nconsultants,  together  with  the  Reform  Working  Group  (para.  11),  will  prepare  reports  that\ndescribe the scope and terms of reference of future work required on specific tasks in the reform\nprogram. They will also prepare a final report that summarizes the recommended and agreed\nupon power sector reform program, and that describes the road map to implement it. The final\nreport, or an executive summary thereof, should be suitable for publication as an ADB paper.\nOutline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 2.\n8. The TA should lead to agreement on more clearly defined goals and market structure for\nthe power sector in Viet Nam. Detailed work plans and programs should be developed to solve\nthe various problems and issues described above. These work plans should include timetables;\ntransition phases; and the respective roles and responsibilities of government agencies, EVN,\nand  the  private  sector  for  implementing  power  sector  reform.  The  TA  will  facilitate  the\nimplementation  of  sector  reforms,  help  resolve  transition  issues,  and  lead  to  effective\nachievement and operation of a restructured power sector.\n9. The conclusions and recommendations of the final report, with the detailed road map to\nimplement power sector reform, should be based on the consensus of the Reform Working\nGroup, who will need to review and approve the final report. ADB, the World Bank, and other aid\nagencies will then be asked to support the reform program in principle, and also to prepare\nfuture loans and TA projects that support major components under this program. The road map\nwill be critical in focusing all stakeholders, both within the Government and among funding\nagencies, on the same jointly agreed upon reform program.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n10. The estimated total cost of the TA is $500,000, of which the foreign exchange cost is\n$376,000  and  the  local  currency  cost  is  $124,000  equivalent.  Cost  details  are  shown  in\nAppendix 3. The Government of France will provide $400,000 equivalent to cover all foreign", "4\nexchange costs and $24,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The Government of Viet Nam\nand EVN will contribute $100,000 in local currency equivalent in the form of services and\nfacilities, including the travel and per diem of counterpart staff and the costs of local workshops.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n11. The Ministry of Industry (MOI), which is responsible for state management of the power\nsector in Viet Nam, will be the Executing Agency for this TA. The minister and vice-minister of\nMOI will provide guidance to the Reform Working Group and consultants, and will help to\norganize meetings for review and comments from other government offices. MOI will appoint a\nReform Working Group of about 12 people, led by a project manager who will be a senior\nprofessional, to work with the consultants on the road map on an intensive basis. The Reform\nWorking Group will include representatives of not only MOI and EVN, but also of other ministries\nand  offices  concerned  with  state-owned  enterprise  reform  and  private  investment  in\ninfrastructure.  The  Reform  Working  Group  will  also  include  adequate  technical  and\nmanagement  expertise  in  the  power  sector.  This  group  will  be  established  before  the\ninternational  consultants  are  appointed.  Representatives  of  the  private  sector  will  also  be\nconsulted as appropriate to seek their views on the best plans for power sector restructuring.\n12. It  is  important  to  emphasize  that  primary  responsibility  for  decisions  on  reform\nobjectives,  and  the  design  of  the  road  map  to  implement  these  reforms,  lies  with  the\nGovernment and its appointed representatives. The Reform Working Group must decide on the\ndetailed reform objectives; it must evaluate the alternative options for implementation of the\nreforms; and it must be responsible for preparing detailed plans to implement the reforms.\nOwnership of and commitment to these planned reforms is essential if they are to succeed. The\nrole of the consultants is not to make these decisions and prepare the detailed plans for the\nReform Working Group, but to help guide them in their discussions on these problems, and\nfocus the participants on the key issues to be addressed, to facilitate discussions, to brief the\nVietnamese  about  international  experience  on  how  other  countries  have  planned  and\nimplemented similar reforms, to help develop and evaluate alternative scenarios for power\nsector development, to advise as appropriate, and to assist the Reform Working Group in\npreparing more detailed plans and a road map to implement the agreed upon power sector\nreforms.\n13. ADB  will  recruit  international  consultants  to  provide  assistance  under  this  TA  in\naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The consultants will have to be\nexperienced in the issues related to power sector reform that are described above. About eight\nperson-months of international consulting services will be financed under the TA budget, as well\nas four person-months of domestic consultants. The domestic consultants will be recruited\nduring  the  inception  mission  under  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  TA  will  be\nimplemented over a period of eight months, to commence in March 2002.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n14. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB\nadministering technical assistance to the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in\nan amount not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000, to be financed by the Government of\nFrance on a grant basis, for the purpose of designing the Road Map for Power Sector Reform,\nand hereby reports such action to the Board.", "VIET NAM:  ROAD MAP FOR POWER SECTOR REFORM\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nProject Monitoring\nDesign Summary TA Targets Risks/Assumptions\nMechanisms\n1.

After the consultants have been appointed, their first task will be to conduct an initial\nassessment of the work required and prepare an inception report with a detailed work plan to\nconduct the technical assistance (TA).\n2. The consultants and the Reform Working Group appointed by the Government will\nreview the power sector reform objectives, and determine if revisions to these need to be made.\nThe consultants will review the progress made to date in the planning and implementation of\npower sector reforms, and also review previous TAs on power sector reform in Viet Nam and\nthe progress made under them.\nB. Major Tasks Under Power Sector Reform Program\n3. The consultants will determine the main reform tasks and transition issues that need to\nbe addressed and solved in the near future, and in the longer term, in order to implement the\npower sector reforms in an effective manner.  These problems can be grouped into four general\nsubjects:  market  structure,  regulation,  tariff  policy,  and  institutional  capacity,  which  are\ndescribed in the following subsections. Very detailed plans for the reform and operation of each\nof these components are not expected to be prepared under the road map TA due to budget\nlimitations, but preliminary plans should be prepared for the most urgent tasks. The main\npurpose of describing these components is to better understand the nature of the problems and\ntasks involved in power sector reform that will have to be solved in the future, and to ensure that\nthese are included in the road map.\n4. The consultants will establish priorities for addressing these problems, and prepare a\ndetailed program to address and resolve these tasks in an integrated manner (the \u201croad map\u201d).\nThey will prepare briefing notes for the important tasks that need to be resolved soon, which\nshould include a description of options and alternative solutions, and a review of international\nexperience with similar reforms.  They will conduct workshops to discuss the options and reach\nconsensus on the best solutions for Viet Nam.\n1.  Power Market Structure\n5. This  involves  restructuring  the  state-owned  enterprises  in  the  power  sector,  i.e.,\nElectricity of Viet Nam (EVN) and its subsidiary power companies; unbundling of EVN into\nseparate  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  business  units,  with  independent\nmanagement and financial accounts; and then creating separate generation, transmission, and\ndistribution companies in the long run. The market structure issues for each subsector are as\nfollows:\n(i)  For generation operations, important features of Viet Nam\u2019s power sector are that\nEVN currently owns and operates most power plants that supply public power,\nand about 60 percent of this generating capacity is hydroelectric, which includes\nseveral  multipurpose  projects.  EVN\u2019s  power  plants  currently  operate  as\ndependent  accounting  units  within  EVN.  EVN  also  has  power  purchase\nagreements with some private power plants, which in 2002 will supply about 7\npercent of EVN\u2019s total net generation requirements. Power purchase agreements\nhave been signed for build-operate-transfer development of some new, large\n(Reference in text, page 2, para. 6; and page 3, para. 7)", "8\nAppendix 2, page 2\nprivate thermal power projects, but none of these have reached financial closing\nor started construction yet. The private projects currently planned will operate\nunder long-term power purchase agreements with EVN. The plans for future\nmarket structure of the generation subsector need to consider and decide upon\nseveral issues:\n(a)  Determine  if  EVN\u2019s  hydropower  projects  should  be  transformed,\nultimately, into independent companies that are allowed to compete for\npower sales in a competitive power pool market. How would multipurpose\nhydro projects operate? How would several hydro projects in cascade on\nthe same river operate? What efficiency improvements can be expected if\nindependent  companies  are  established?  How  would  tariffs  for  such\nindependent companies be established? If such hydro project companies\nsell into a competitive power pool market, total costs of bulk power supply\nwould probably increase, since the competitive power pool prices that are\nset by the marginal costs of new thermal power plants will be much higher\nthan the average accounting cost now for power from these EVN-owned\nhydro projects.\n(b)  Determine  if  and  when  EVN\u2019s  thermal  power  plants  should  be\ntransformed into independent companies that are allowed to compete for\npower  sales  in  a  competitive  power  pool  market.  What  efficiency\nimprovements  would  be  expected?    How  would  tariffs  for  such\nindependent companies be established?  The ultimate purpose of making\nthese  thermal  power  plants  independent  would  be  to  ensure  fair\ncompetition with the private sector for dispatch in a competitive power\npool. When should such competition be introduced in Viet Nam? If the\nnew  independent  power  projects  operate  under  long-term  power\npurchase  agreements  for  some  period  of  time,  with  take-or-pay\nprovisions, would continued EVN ownership of its thermal power plants\nrepresent a conflict of interest during this phase? At what stage does\ncontinued EVN ownership of its old thermal power plants create unfair\ncompetition? Should these thermal power plants be sold to the private\nsector  at  that  stage,  or  should  they  simply  be  transformed  into\nindependent  state-owned  enterprises;  but  then  how  would  their\nindependence be assured?\n(c)  Determine the appropriate duration of bulk power supply contracts for\nnew private power projects: whether these should all be long-term power\npurchase agreements for a period of 20 years; or whether the market\nstructure for private power sales should change at some stage so that all\nbulk power is sold into a power pool with short-term contracts and spot\nmarket prices; or whether a mix of short-term, medium-term, and long-\nterm  contracts  should  be  allowed,  depending  on  buyer  and  seller\npreferences.\n(d)  Prepare  guidelines  for  the  private  development  of  hydro  projects,\nincluding procedures for issuing exploration licenses and development\nlicenses, and guidelines for power purchase agreements.\n(ii)  For transmission and dispatch operations, the issues are to\n(a)  Determine  if  the  responsibilities  for  transmission  system  management\nand  dispatch,  divided  among  four  transmission  companies  at  present\nshould be consolidated and integrated, and if so, how this should be\ndone.", "9\nAppendix 2, page 3\n(b)  Determine  the  best  model  to  manage  bulk  power  purchases  in  a\ncompetitive  market  for  bulk  power  supply,  considering  the  following\noptions: (i) a national integrated transmission company could become the\nsingle buyer of power produced by EVN\u2019s generating companies and the\nprivate power plants; it would dispatch these as required, and sell all bulk\npower supply to the distribution companies; or (ii) a separate bulk power\ntrading company, nonprofit and government-owned, could be established\nto manage all bulk power purchases and sales to distribution companies,\nwith the transmission company providing only transmission services; or\n(iii) direct contracts could be made between the power plants and the\ndistribution  companies,  and  the  transmission  company  would  transmit\nthese at an allowed tariff. A staged development is also an option, which\nwould begin with stage (i) above, then move to stage (ii), and then to\nstage (iii).\n(c)  Determine the requirements for a grid code for operation of the national\ntransmission system at various stages in the power sector restructuring,\nand prepare draft terms of reference for it.\n(iii)  For the distribution subsector, the issues are to determine\n(a)  how many distribution companies should be established; how their areas\nof coverage should be established; and if rural distribution should be\nseparated from urban distribution;\n(b)  a reasonable basis for tariff setting and allowed profitability of distribution\ncompanies  that  will  promote  efficiency  improvements,  will  ensure  fair\ntariffs to consumers, will ensure a reasonable self-financing ratio, and\ncould attract private investment if these companies are privatized;\n(c)  if diversified ownership of distribution should be planned in the future, and\nif so, when and how;\n(d)  if distribution cooperatives in rural areas are feasible, and if so, how such\ncooperatives should operate;\n(e)  if special assistance or subsidies for rural electrification will be required\nand justified after restructuring; and\n(f)  how the objectives of the Government\u2019s Rural Electrification Policy paper\nof 2000 can be achieved.\n2.  Power Sector Regulation\n6. State management functions in the electricity sector should be categorized into three\ngeneral areas: policy making, regulation, and ownership of state-owned enterprises and assets\nin the power sector. Primary responsibility for these distinct management functions should be\nallocated to separate agencies in a manner that overcomes current problems with overlapping\nresponsibilities and the associated conflicts of interest. These functions are described further:\n(i)  The establishment of a national energy policy council has been proposed to\nformulate policies for the energy sector. This council would include very senior\ngovernment  officials:  the  Prime  Minister  could  be  the  chairman,  and  other\ncouncilors would be at the minister or deputy minister level. The road map for\npower sector reform needs to consider such a proposal. If this is agreed to, then\nit will be necessary to determine the functions and scope of responsibility of such\na council, and to prepare a plan for a permanent office and staff (a secretariat) of\nappropriate size to support the operation of such a council.", "10\nAppendix 2, page 4\n(ii)  The creation of an independent new regulatory agency is one of the primary\nobjectives of the new Electricity Law. To ensure the independence and credibility\nof this regulatory agency, the Electricity Law should reflect the following basic\ndecisions, which need to be determined on a priority basis under the power\nsector road map:\n(a)  Appropriate location of the regulatory agency. This should be separate\nfrom  and  independent  of  the  agencies  that  perform  the  ownership\nfunction (EVN and Ministry of Industry [MOI]). However, in the immediate\nterm, it may be more practical for the regulatory agency to operate initially\nwithin MOI, and then transfer in a year or two to an independent location.\n(b)  Decision making powers and authority of the regulatory agency. This\nagency should have sufficient authority to make final decisions based on\neconomic and technical considerations, within the framework of the new\nElectricity Law and government policy as determined and promulgated by\nthe national energy policy council.\n(c)  Procedures for the appointment and removal of commissioners to the\nregulatory agency.\n(d)  Functions of the regulatory agency. These will include some transfer of\nresponsibilities for such functions as tariff approvals from other agencies\nthat have been involved in such activities in the past.\n(iii)  It must be decided which agency or offices will be responsible for long-term\npower  supply  planning,  including  load  forecasting,  planning  for  generation\nexpansion,  transmission  planning,  and  negotiation  of  power  purchase\nagreements  for  new  private  power  projects.  The  role  of  the  new  regulatory\nagency in reviewing and approving these plans also needs to be determined.\n3.  Power Tariff and Pricing Principles\n7. The power sector reform program needs to establish fair, equitable, and transparent\ncriteria and procedures for developing and approving electricity tariffs that allow for full cost\nrecovery and that promote efficiency and gradual removal of subsidies. Tariff rates will need to\nbe considered at several levels, including tariffs for bulk power supply from EVN or government-\nowned  power  plants,  transmission  tariffs,  bulk  power  supply  tariffs  to  various  distribution\ncompanies, and retail tariff levels for various consumer categories.\n8. Detailed  procedures  for  setting  tariffs  for  EVN\u2019s  existing  power  plants  have  been\nprepared under recent World Bank TA.1 EVN issued a regulation in April 2001 to implement\nthese new tariffs by 1 January 2002, initially for the purpose of internal transfer pricing, and to\nimplement commercial practices in these operations. Power plant tariffs will include a fixed\ncapacity charge and an energy charge, with incentives to promote efficiency improvements and\nshare cost savings with power plant staff.\n9. EVN\u2019s  distribution  companies  currently  charge  a  uniform  retail  tariff  throughout  the\ncountry. EVN\u2019s bulk transfer price to each distribution company is set at a level that will allow it\nto earn a reasonable net profit, based on its current costs of operation with some adjustment for\nagreed upon norms.

Improvements in\ndistribution tariff design are required to bring tariffs closer to actual costs of service for each\nregion and each consumer group, although some cross-subsidies may continue; to refine the\nnorms for target efficiency; and to link staff bonuses to improvements in efficiency, rather than\nsimply an automatic share of total \u201cnet earnings.\u201d\n10. The general principles for design of transmission tariffs have also been reviewed,2 but\nsuch tariffs have not yet been implemented. Proper tariff setting procedures are essential in all\nsubsectors to provide incentives required for efficiency improvements and economy at each\nlevel of power supply operations and consumption, and also to attract investment and provide\nretained earnings to finance sector expansion.\n4.  Institutional Capacity\n11. The consultants will:\n(i)  Assess the needs and recommend programs for capacity building and training of\nthe institutions involved in the power sector reform program to ensure that the\nreforms will be implemented properly and efficiently, and will be sustainable.\n(ii)  Identify  cross-cutting  civil  service  issues  that  will  have  to  be  resolved  to\nimplement the planned power sector restructuring, and make recommendations\non how these could be addressed in the broader context of civil service reforms.\nC. Main Outputs\n12. The consultants will prepare task reports on various power sector reform subjects as\nrequired.  They  will  conduct  several  workshops  to  discuss  the  reform  program  and  reach\nconsensus on the overall framework for reforms and the road map to implement this. The\nconsultants, together with the Reform Working Group, will prepare reports that describe the\nscope and terms of reference of future work required on specific tasks in the reform program.\nThey will also prepare a final report that summarizes the current policies and the recommended\nand agreed upon overall plans for power sector reform, and that describes the program of future\nwork required to address each of the major tasks and transition issues involved in the reform.\nThe program, or road map, should describe time schedules for each task, various milestones,\nwho is responsible for each task, the interrelationships among the different tasks, and the work\nrequired to complete each task. The consultants will also participate in a seminar to present the\nfinal  draft  report  of  the  TA  with  participation  of  concerned  government  officers  and\nrepresentatives from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank. The final report,\nor an executive summary thereof, should be suitable for publication as an ADB paper.\n                  \n2  See report on \u201cGeneration-Transmission Transfer Pricing System\u201d and also report on Improvement of Power\nSector Regulatory Framework, completed August 2000 by Hagler Bailly Consultants under ADB TA 2888.", "12\nAppendix 3\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($'000)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.
