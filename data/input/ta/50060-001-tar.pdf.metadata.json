INTRODUCTION \n1.  Strengthening  capacity  to  collect  domestic  revenue  is  indispensable  for  developing \ncountries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of domestic revenues driving \ndevelopment financing.1 Strengthening domestic resource mobilization\u2014including international \nsupport  for  developing  countries  to  improve  domestic  capacity  for  tax  and  other  revenue \ncollection\u2014is a target under SDG 17 to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize \nthe global partnership for sustainable development.2 The Addis Tax Initiative (ATI) stresses the \nimportance of tackling both cross-border and domestic tax evasion and avoidance.3 The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has worked with tax authorities in ADB developing member countries \n(DMCs)\u2014through regional conferences, tax policy and administration research, and training \nseminars on tax issues\u2014to identify challenges and opportunities to enhance tax authorities\u2019 \ncapacity and regional cooperation. This technical assistance (TA) will conduct tax policy and \nadministration research  and  training  courses, designed  based  on  research and  a  capacity \ndevelopment  needs  assessment,  to  enhance  the  capacity  and  regional  cooperation  of  tax \nauthorities. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Many developing countries seek TA to help broaden and protect the domestic tax base, \nimprove domestic tax compliance, and implement tools and procedures to stem both cross-\nborder and domestic tax evasion and tax avoidance.5 Strengthening domestic revenue systems \nis not just a question of raising revenue. It is also about designing a tax system that promotes \ninclusiveness, encourages good governance, promotes investments and job creation, matches \nsociety\u2019s views on reducing inequality, and promotes social justice.6 This is particularly relevant \nin developing Asia, where a large number of economies have low tax collection rates, usually \nbelow 20% of gross domestic product.7 \n \n3.  Raising tax revenue poses many challenges for developing countries. Specific obstacles \ninclude weak tax administrations, low taxpayer morale and compliance, corruption, a small tax \nbase, and missing reciprocal links between tax and public and social expenditures.8 \n \n4.  The  rapid  globalization  of  financial  services,  investment,  and  trade  poses  new \nchallenges and opportunities in international taxation, particularly for developing countries. The \nGroup of Twenty (G20) has identified base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) as a serious risk \n                                                \n1  The United Nations  Open Working Group proposed SDG Target 17.1 which states \u201cStrengthen domestic resource \nmobilization, including through international support to developing countries, to improve domestic capacity for tax \nand other revenue collection.\u201d \n2United Nations. Sustainable Development Goal 17. https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg17 \n3  ATI was launched during the Third International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa in July \n2015. The initiative (i) sets the importance of domestic revenue for financing development, (ii) calls for additional \ndevelopment cooperation in this area, and (iii) highlights the importance of tackling tax evasion and avoidance. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 October 2016. \n5  The Addis Tax Initiative. 2015.

Bonn. \n ", "2 \n \nto  tax  revenues,  sovereignty,  and  fair  taxation  systems  worldwide.9 The  Organisation  for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported to the G20 finance ministers at \ntheir meeting on 8 October 2015 in Lima, Peru that developing countries can raise more \nrevenue and create a more stable investment climate for business by addressing BEPS issues. \n \n5.  BEPS  has  a  particularly  significant  effect  for  tax  revenue  in  some  of  the  poorest \ncountries, which rely very heavily on tax revenue from multinational enterprises. The impact of \nBEPS  on  developing  countries,  however,  extends  beyond  revenue.  BEPS  undermines  the \ncredibility of the tax system in the eyes of all taxpayers. Confidence in\u2014and effectiveness of\u2014\nthe tax system is undermined, if the largest and most high-profile taxpayers are seen to be \navoiding tax. \n \n6.  International  organizations  and  national  governments  worldwide  have  joined  in  an \nunprecedented effort to reduce cross-border tax avoidance and increase transparency. The \nGlobal Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes provides tools to \nenhance international tax cooperation and transparency.10 As more countries become active in \nthe  BEPS  program,  and  use  a  standard  format  for  automatic  exchange  of  information, \nopportunities  to  protect  each  country\u2019s  domestic  revenue  base  and  provide  finance  for \ndevelopment are growing. \n \n7.  Given  DMCs\u2019  strong  demand  for  support  in  domestic  resource  mobilization  (DRM) \nthrough  efficient  and  transparent  tax  administrations  and  the  significant  program  already \nunderway in regional departments, ADB extended TAs to the tax authorities of the Maldives, \nMongolia, and the Philippines in 2011. Effective taxation provides a reliable and sustainable \nsource of revenue to promote growth and counteract dependence on aid. There is therefore a \npotential to further expand operations for DRM.11 \n \n8.  The primary forum for regional cooperation among tax authorities in the Asia and Pacific \nregion is the Study Group on Asian Tax Administration and Research (SGATAR).12ADB is an \nobserver member at the annual SGATAR meetings and, recently, has been approached to \nprovide a platform for training programs to help DMCs implement BEPS recommendations and \n                                                \n9  The OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project provides governments with solutions to close gaps in \nexisting international rules that allow corporate profits to disappear or shift to low- or no-tax environments where \nlittle or no economic activity takes place. \n10 The Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes is an international organization \nmandated by the G20 and promoted by the Addis Tax Initiative. \n11 Examples are: (i) ADB. 2016. Improving Domestic Resource Mobilization for Inclusive Growth Program. Manila. \n(Loan 3282-GEO); (ii) ADB. 2014. Local Government Finance and Fiscal Decentralization Reform Program.

(TA 8877-INO). \n12 SGATAR  was  initiated  at  the  Fifth  Southeast  Asian  Ministerial  Conference  for  Economic  Development  in \nYogyakarta in 1970 as a study group for review and exchange of information on tax structures in Southeast Asia. \nThe first SGATAR meeting was held in Manila in 1971; members comprise Australia; Cambodia; the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; Japan; the Republic of Korea; Macau, China; Malaysia; \nMongolia; New Zealand; Papua New Guinea; the Philippines; Singapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; and Viet Nam. \n ", "3 \nautomatic exchange of information for tax purposes (AEOI).13The OECD and the Global Forum \nhave also recognized the need for training in Asia and the Pacific and expressed support for \nADB  to  lead  capacity-development  activities  for  SGATAR  member  countries.  This  TA  will \ndeliver the training requested by SGATAR members and contribute to DRM. \n \n9.  In 2015, ADB hosted a Global Forum and OECD workshop on Automatic Exchange of \nInformation, and 58 government officials from 27 countries, including Cambodia, Indonesia, \nMalaysia,  Mongolia,  Papua  New  Guinea,  the  Philippines,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam,  were \nrepresented by key information and communication technology (ICT) personnel as well as \ninternational tax officers. \n \n10.  Since 2014, ADB has provided TA at a regional level to enhance transparency and \nexchange of information for tax purposes.14 There were many requests for further assistance, \nespecially  to  draft  legislation  and  develop  ICT  systems  for  AEOI.  Several  participants\u2014\nespecially  small  jurisdictions  and  small  island  states\u2014requested  for  in-country  assistance. \nThere were also a number of requests for assistance on making effective use of the data \nreceived.  Other  suggestions  for  support  included  audit  work  on  international  transactions, \ncombating international tax avoidance and evasion, and the use of voluntary disclosure regimes. \nThis TA will produce a recommendation report, which will propose issues that require further \ncapacity  development  in  regional  and  country-level  contexts  for  eight  DMCs,  and  will \ndisseminate reports to relevant regional departments. \n \n11.  In April 2016, ADB joined more than 30 countries and international organizations in \nexpressing support for the ATI. The ATI aims to boost DRM capacity, covering both tax effort \nand countering leakages through tax cooperation, in support of the SDGs. ADB, under its \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date), is working to set out its role in supporting \nDMCs  through  TA  projects  or  policy  dialogue  to  enhance  their  capacity  to  meet  the \ninternationally agreed standards for tax transparency, to counter tax evasion, and to protect \nthemselves  against  aggressive  tax  planning (all  of  which  increase the  risks  of  corruption, \nmoney laundering, and the financing of terrorism). \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  impact  will  be  increased  sustainable tax  revenue  for  development financing  in \nsupport of the ATI. The outcome will be enhanced capacity of national tax administrations to \nincrease resource mobilization in target DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will strengthen the capacity of tax authorities in target countries15 to collect tax \nby (i) broadening and protecting the domestic tax base by implementing the BEPS report \n                                                \n13 The  standard  calls  on  jurisdiction  to  obtain  information  from  DMCs\u2019  financial  institutions  and  automatically \nexchange that information with other jurisdiction on an annual basis. The OECD and the Global Forum\u2019s work is \nsupported by the G20 process (G20. 2013. G20 Leaders\u2019 Declaration. Adopted at the G20 Leader\u2019s Summit.

For the effective and sustainable capacity development of tax authorities, the \nfocus will be on developing training modules, and delivering training courses targeting tax \nofficials. The TA has three main outputs. \n \n(i)  Knowledge-sharing workshop on developments and country experiences \nin improving domestic resource mobilization delivered. A workshop for tax \npolicy  and  administration  officials  in  target  DMCs  will  (a)  discuss  the  latest \ndevelopments  in  improving  DRM  by  implementing  internationally  agreed \nstandards, including legal and administrative reforms; and (b) encourage peer-to-\npeer sharing of experience. It will also identify issues to be addressed at the \nregional level by the participating tax authorities. \n(ii)  In-country consultation delivered and country capacity development needs \nassessment  and  recommendation  report  prepared.16The  first  stage  will  \nassess the current state of taxation, including tax administration capacity, in the \ntarget  countries.  The  TA  project  will  deliver  a  capacity  development  needs \nassessment  and  recommendation  report  (consultant\u2019s  report).  Substantive \ntraining and operational support will be provided on selected topics related to \nDRM in some of the target DMCs, based on the capacity development needs \nassessment. \n(iii)  Capacity-building  activities  for  tax  policy  and  administration  officials, \nincluding knowledge-sharing with partner organizations, conducted. The \ntraining courses will be based on the capacity development needs assessment \nconducted at the country level under output (2) and issues identified at the \nregional level under output (1). Training will also be conducted with support from \nother international organizations, including OECD and the ADB Institute. Support \nfrom other international organizations will aim (a) to provide the latest information \non developments in international taxation and advice on policy and technical \nissues, and (b) to enable participating countries to establish a roadmap toward \nimplementing  international  standards.  Possible  topics  include  implementation \nand legislation to align with global standards on international taxation, including \nBEPS,  AEOI,  risk  management  and  audit,  human  resource  management, \nintegrity, ICT for tax administration, revenue statistics, DRM (including tax and \nnontax  revenues),  and  international  tax  crime  investigations.  A  follow-up \nassessment and outcome evaluation of the TA outputs will be conducted and \nreported. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. \n \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Enhancing Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes. \nManila (TA 8640-REG). \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department will be the executing \nagency for the TA. The TA will be carried out in coordination with other ADB grant and TA \nprojects on the capacity development of tax authorities being implemented by ADB\u2019s regional \ndepartments,  Office  of  Anticorruption  and  Integrity,  and  Economic  Research  and  Regional \nCooperation Department. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented in partnership with external partner organizations that have \nexpertise and practical experience in tax policy and administration in both global and regional \ncontexts.  The  OECD  Centre  for  Tax  Policy  and  Administration  is  promoting  international \nstandards on tax policy and administration, and the National Tax Agency, Japan, and the \nAustralian Taxation Office are leading regional good practices on international cooperation \namong tax authorities. These entities are expected to provide resource persons for technical \nconsultation sessions and training. The TA will affirm that relevant officials will be nominated. \n \n17.  The TA requires 11 experts (three international consultants with 31 person-months of \ninputs, and eight national consultants with 68 person-months of inputs). The three international \nconsultants  will  produce  assessment  and  recommendation  reports  and  lead  capacity \ndevelopment activities; the eight national consultants will assist the international consultants \nwith country-specific expertise, affirm that relevant officials will be invited, and provide support to \ncapacity development activities. As assignments are specific and narrowly defined, individual \nconsultants are most appropriate. Consultants will be engaged by ADB on an individual basis, in \npartial  lump-sum  contracts  arrangement,  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursement under the TA will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). No TA activities will be financed or undertaken in the territory of a DMC until a no-\nobjection confirmation has been obtained from the government concerned. \n \n18.  The tax policy and administration specialist will regularly report progress to ADB. A \nrecommendation  report  will  be  widely  disseminated  among  DMCs  and  international \norganizations as well as within ADB. The TA will be implemented from 1 November 2016 and \nwill be completed by 31 October 2018. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Strengthening Tax Policy and \nAdministration Capacity to Mobilize Domestic Resources, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Technical Assistance Project is Aligned With \nSustainable tax revenue for development financing in support of Addis Tax Initiativea increased \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nwith Targets and  Reporting \nResults Chain  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nCapacity of national tax  By 2018, a new guide to  A follow-up assessment  Capacity development \nadministrations to  advance domestic  prepared by the tax  activities do not \nincrease resource  revenue, based on  policy and  immediately lead to tax \nmobilization in target  technical assistance  administration specialist  reforms due to lack of \ndeveloping member  recommendations and  and team leader  institution-wide \ncountries (DMCs)  training courses,    understanding, \nenhanced  adopted in at least two  Country reports at  commitment, and \nDMCs  Study Group on Asian  willingness of \n(2016 baseline: 0)  Tax Administration and  government institutions \nResearch\u2019s annual  and stakeholders to \nmeetings  participate in \nimplementing reforms. \n \nGovernment staff \nturnover is possible. \nOutputs       \n1.
