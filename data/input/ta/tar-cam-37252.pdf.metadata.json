During a series of dialogues between the Government of Cambodia and the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  on  ADB's  country  program  for  Cambodia,  the  Government \nemphasized the need for a renewed strategy for national agricultural research and consensus \nbuilding  among  key  stakeholders  for  the  strategy.  In April 2003, the Government officially \nrequested ADB for technical assistance (TA) to prepare a master plan for national agricultural \nresearch.  ADB  fielded  the  TA  Fact-finding  Mission  in  October  2003,  which  reached  an \nunderstanding with the Government on the objective, scope, implementation arrangements, and \nterms of reference for the TA. The TA is included in the ADB\u2019s 2003 TA program for Cambodia \nunder the country strategy and program update (2004\u20132006).1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In Cambodia, the agriculture sector remains a major contributor to the national economy, \naccounting for 39% of the gross domestic product and employing about 70% of the total \nworkforce. Sustainable agricultural growth is essential for the broad-based improvement of \npeople's livelihoods in the country. Rice self-sufficiency was achieved in Cambodia over the \npast decade as a result of improved varieties and cropping systems. However, yield levels and \ncropping intensities remain low compared with those in similar ecosystems in the neighboring \ncountries. Most farmers comprise smallholders with less than 1 hectare per household and \nusing subsistence farming systems. An important constraint on agricultural commercialization \nand diversification for increased cash income is the limited access of farmers to improved \ntechnology and knowledge due primarily to insufficient investments in agricultural research and \nextension. As a result, farmers' linkages with urban and international markets and agribusiness \nare extremely weak. \n \n3.  In  1998,  the  Government  approved  a  national  policy  for  agricultural  research  and \nextension to establish a sustainable system in the long run.2 This policy called for (i) the \nestablishment of a semi-autonomous core research institute; (ii) stakeholder participation in the \norganization, management, and implementation of research and extension; (iii) client focus of \nagricultural research and extension services; (iv) promotion of private sector participation in the \ndelivery of research and extension services where possible; (v) well-defined responsibilities of \ngovernment agencies in service delivery; and (vi) human resource development for improved \nquality of services. While part of the policy has been implemented, including the establishment \nof  the  Cambodian  Agricultural  Research  and  Development  Institute  (CARDI)  as  a  primary \ninstitution for national rice research, the approved policy has not been widely known or adopted \nto guide public investments in agricultural research and extension due to the lack of follow-up \nactivities  to  disseminate  and  implement  the  policy.  As  a  result,  essential  dialogue  and \nawareness-building activities on research and extension have been limited. \n \n4.  Under  the  Second  Socioeconomic  Development  Plan  (SEDPII:  2001\u20132005),  the \nGovernment aims at transforming agriculture into a driving force for sustainable economic \ngrowth, poverty reduction, and employment generation. SEDPII's agriculture strategy is to \npromote commercialization and agro-industry development in the policy framework for a liberal \nand market-oriented trade environment. One of the important strategic thrusts of SEDPII is to \nuse essential agricultural research and extension services to improve the knowledge and skills \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 29 August 2003. \n2  Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. 1998. Cambodia Agricultural Research and Extension Policy \nStatement. Phnom Penh. ", "2 \nof farmers for different agro-ecological zones and farming systems. In Cambodia, the national \ncapacity for agricultural research in terms of management, organization, facilities, and human \nresources needs to be substantially strengthened. Although some capacity for rice research \nexists  at  CARDI  with  the  long-term  support  from  the  Government  of  Australia  and  the \nInternational Rice Research Institute, the knowledge base is particularly weak for production of \ncrops  other  than  rice,  and  for  fishery,  livestock,  and  forestry  subsectors.  Consequently, \ntechnology and information are insufficiently tested for transfer to farmers by the agricultural \nextension  system,  farmers  have  a  limited  ability  for  agricultural  diversification  and \ncommercialization,  and  Cambodia  has  poor  capability  to  identify  and  adapt  promising \ntechnology from neighboring countries.  \n \n5.  Agricultural commercialization depends on improvements in product quality together with \nappropriately developed value chains, policies, and regulations. Institutional capacity for the \ndevelopment,  testing,  and  dissemination  of  improved  technology  and  information  is  also \nfundamental to agricultural transformation, with the capacity of national agricultural research the \nkey to scientific advances in agriculture. \n \n6.  Because Cambodia has complex agricultural research requirements, the Government \nrecognizes the need for better management of national agricultural research. Multiple partners \nare involved in agricultural research and extension in Cambodia, including departments and \ninstitutes in different government ministries, universities, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \nprivate  business,  and  external  funding  agencies.  To  achieve  advances  in  the  growth  of \nsustainable agriculture, these partners need to become a functioning national system with \nshared  perceptions,  vision,  and  objectives  for  technology-led improvements in agricultural \nproductivity  and  product  quality.  The  currently  overlapping  research  activities  need  to  be \nstreamlined to use scarce national resources effectively. A master plan for national agricultural \nresearch offers opportunities for public and private stakeholders to examine the current situation \nof research, resolve strategic and organizational issues, and develop shared research programs \nand priorities. \n \n7.  At present, major constraints to enhancing a national agricultural research system exist \nin the following areas: \n(i)  Financial  resources.  An  effective  system  is  required  to  plan  and  manage \nmedium-term fiscal resources for agriculture so that scarce resources can be \nproperly allocated for priority research programs in a well structured manner. The \nGovernment has decided to introduce a medium-term expenditure framework \ninto  agriculture  from  2004,  to  strengthen  the  planning  and  management  of \nresources in the sector. ADB\u2019s Agriculture Sector Development Program3 will \ncomplement  the  TA  and  accelerate  introduction  of  a  proper  medium-term \nframework. \n(ii)  Human resources.  Planning and management of scientific and management \nstaff  for  research  appear  substantially  weak  with  no  formal  or  objective \nprocedures  for  recruitment,  performance  assessment,  advancement,  or \nsanctions.  Recommendations  for  the  design  of  such  a  system  need  to  be \ndeveloped and adopted. Appropriate criteria and guidelines for human resource \nplanning and management with an adequate incentive system are needed for \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2003.

", "    3 \nacquiring  scientific  technical  skills  and  training  required,  based  on  research \nprogram planning and priority setting. \n(iii)  Information  management.  Information  management  systems  that  link \ninformation on research activities, funds, personnel, and facilities at different \nlevels of the system are required for developing a national research system. The \nlack  of  such  systems  often  leads  to  poor  management  of  resources  for \nagricultural  research,  and  hampers  adjustments  in  ongoing  research  and \ndetermination of research results and impacts. \n(iv)  Research facilities. The facilities of universities and research institutes need to \nbe  rehabilitated,  and  strengthened  to  the  required  minimum  for  supporting \nessential  research  activities  under  a  renewed  strategy.  In  this  context,  a \ncomprehensive assessment is needed of the number and location of institutes, \nand the facilities and equipment, and to help establish a lean and sustainable \nnational system. \n \n8.  A master plan for national agricultural research is needed to address these current \nissues and to generate the country's strong ownership for (i) establishing a renewed strategy for \nresearch, (ii) clarifying and agreeing on scientific objectives and priorities, (iii) planning the \nresearch program contents to implement those priorities, and (iv) defining the resources needed \nfor carrying out these plans. The master plan will also identify means to improve the structure, \norganization and management of agricultural research, and strengthen linkages at different \nlevels among research and extension services, farmers, and private businesses. It will help \nestablish a national agricultural research system, capable of planning and carrying out high \npriority adaptive and applied research in collaboration with a wide range of stakeholders, \nincluding universities, colleges, international research organizations, NGOs, farmer groups, and \nother  private  sector  organizations  to  support  the  commercialization  and  diversification  of \nagriculture. \n \n9.  The TA is in line with ADB's sector strategy to help achieve the Government's objectives \nof  sustainable  agricultural  growth  and  reduction  in  rural  poverty.  It  will  also  contribute  to \npromoting private sector participation in agriculture, and improving farmers' access to productive \nopportunities.  The  TA  is  essential  for  formulating  the  proposed  master  plan  for  national \nagricultural research and market-oriented agricultural growth. Major external funding agencies in \nthe agriculture sector fully support the process of the master plan formulation. The TA will \ncomplement the activities of other projects and programs of ADB and other external funding \nagencies. Based on the ADB's operations experiences, the TA will involve a wide range of \nstakeholders to reflect their views in the discussions on national agricultural research. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The TA will assist the Government in formulating a master plan for national agricultural \nresearch that will provide strategic direction and identify priority research objectives for the \nmedium term. The initiative will strengthen national agricultural research by defining areas for \nthe improvement of research policy, strategy, and management, and by identifying priority \nobjectives and activities to be shared by partners in agricultural research. The logical framework \nfor the TA is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will be carried out in three phases: (i) review and assessment of the existing \npolicies and strategies for agricultural research and extension, (ii) development of a renewed \nstrategy for national agricultural research in the medium term, and (iii) identification of the \npriority research programs based on current and future research needs in the agriculture sector. \n \n12.  The TA will (i) study the current state and inventory of the national agricultural research \nsystem  in  terms  of  institutional  setting,  research  facilities,  research  staff  capacity,  service \nconditions, funding, priorities, organization and management of research, and linkages with \nfarmers  and  other  partners;  (ii)  examine  the  research  system\u2019s  strengths,  weaknesses, \nopportunities, and threats in relation to rapidly changing internal and external environments, \nincluding export markets; (iii) examine lessons from and experience of other countries in South \nand Southeast Asia in developing an effective and participatory national agricultural research \nsystem; (iv) recommend alternative structural options for establishing a lean and sustainable \nagricultural  research  system  to  ensure  good  governance  and  management;  (v)  promote \nresearch linkages and partnerships with universities, agencies involved in extension services, \nregional and international research organizations, agro-processing industries and agribusiness, \nand external funding agencies; (vi) assess environmental and gender concerns to be integrated \nin agricultural research; (vii) assess needs for research personnel; information management \nsystems; and monitoring, evaluation, and impact assessments; and (viii) study possible access \nto  agricultural  biotechnology  and  its  proper  use.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants are in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $360,000  equivalent,  comprising  $195,000  in  foreign \nexchange costs and $165,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide $300,000 to \nfinance the entire foreign exchange costs and part of the local  currency costs, amounting to \n$105,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from  ADB-funded TA Special \nFund. The balance of the local currency costs, amounting to $60,000 equivalent, will be met by \nthe Government to cover office accommodations, counterpart staff support, facilities for seminars \nand meetings, and other administrative expenses and part of field transport. A Government \nrepresentative will be invited as an observer for TA contract negotiations. The detailed cost \nestimates are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) will be the Executing Agency \nfor the TA, and have overall responsibility for TA implementation. A project coordinator for the \nTA will be appointed by MAFF. MAFF satisfactorily implemented an ADB loan for the Agriculture \nSector Program and its related TA,4 and has adequate capacity to implement the TA. Since the \nTA will be a national planning exercise covering a wide range of subsectors and activities in the \nagriculture sector, an agricultural research steering committee will be established at MAFF to \nguide the TA activities with representatives of relevant departments of MAFF, the Council for \nAgricultural and Rural Development, other agencies of the Government, research institutes, \nuniversities, civil society organizations, private business, and external funding agencies.

There will be working groups for the \nsubsectors of crops, livestock, fishery, forestry and agro-industry, each headed by a leading \nscientist in an appropriate discipline and comprising a team of national agricultural researchers. \nThe working groups will (i) support the formulation of the master plan, (ii) contribute appropriate \ndata and information for the preparation of subsector reports, (iii) determine client research \nneeds of farmers and other stakeholders through a series of consultations, and (iv) prepare \npreliminary research activity portfolios for program planning and priority setting during the \nformulation of a master plan. The consultant team recruited under the TA will closely work with \nthese working groups for the formulation of the master plan. Key stakeholders will be consulted \nthroughout the process, and will participate in workshops to discuss and resolve issues, and set \nthe research program agenda.  \n \n15.  The TA will be carried out during 9 months, from April to December 2004. At least three \ntripartite review meetings involving the Government, the TA consultant team, and ADB will be \norganized to review the progress and resolve any outstanding policy and implementation issues. \nThe thematic group of external funding agencies for the agriculture sector will be regularly briefed \non the progress of the TA. The consulting services required under the TA include (i) 8 person-\nmonths of international consultants in the fields of agricultural research management and \nagricultural economics; and (ii) 12 person-months of domestic consultants in the fields of \nagricultural research policy, research systems, environment, and social and gender analysis. \nThe international consultant for agricultural research management will be the team leader. An \ninternational  research  organization  or  consulting  firm  will  provide  all  the  international and \ndomestic  consulting  services  required  for  the  TA.  The  selection  and  engagement  of  the \nconsultants for the TA will be done by ADB in accordance with the ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. ADB's standard quality- and cost-based selection method will be used for the \nselection, and ADB will request simplified technical proposals from the shortlisted consulting \nfirms. The consultant will purchase necessary office equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Equipment procured under the TA will be handed over to the \nGovernment at TA completion. \n \n16.  The consultant will prepare (i) an inception report, including a detailed work program for \nthe TA, to be submitted within 3 weeks of the start of the TA and to be discussed at the initial \ntripartite review meeting; (ii) an interim report, which is the first draft of the master plan \npresenting preliminary findings based on the TA's interim results during the first phase, to be \nsubmitted within 4 months of the TA and to be discussed at stakeholder workshops and at the \ninterim tripartite review meeting; (iii) a draft final report (the second draft of the master plan), at \nleast 2 months before the completion of the TA and to be discussed at regional and national \nseminars, and at the final tripartite review meeting; and (iv) a final report, to be presented as the \nmaster plan upon completion of the TA. The reports will be translated into the Khmer language \nas appropriate. A preliminary outline of the final report is in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.
