THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the additional financing of the Health System \nEnhancement Project. The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be \nprovided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for the additional financing of the Health \nSystem Enhancement Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the ongoing Health System Enhancement \nProject (original project) for $50.0 million, comprising a $37.5 million loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources and a $12.5 million grant from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources on 23 October \n2018. The original project aims to ensure that efficiency, equity, and responsiveness of the \nprimary health care (PHC) system is improved. The proposed additional financing will bridge the \nfinancing gap created by the reallocations of funds for emergency COVID-19 pandemic response \nand support additional interventions such as (i) scaling up primary and secondary health care \nthrough the shared care cluster approach in Central, North Central, Sabaragamuwa, and Uva \nprovinces, (ii) improving the government\u2019s response capacity to better address the ongoing \ndevastation of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, and (iii) supporting the e-learning in \nthe health sector. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Health status. Sri Lanka, an island with a population of 21.9 million, has made significant \nprogress in the last few decades on socioeconomic and human development indicators in \nensuring access to health services for all.1 The vaccine-preventable disease burden has been \nwell controlled, with immunization coverage at more than 99%.2 Maternal and child care services \ncoverage is nearly 100%, the maternal mortality ratio is very low at 32.0 per 100,000 live births, \nthe infant mortality rate is 8.9 per 1,000 live births, and the under age 5 mortality rate is 9.5 per \n1,000 live births.3 Some vector-borne diseases like malaria and filaria have been eliminated, while \ndiseases like dengue and leptospirosis are endemic. Sri Lanka\u2019s population is rapidly aging, and \nas much as 16% of the population is over the age of 60.4 The noncommunicable disease (NCD) \nand risk factor burdens are significant, accounting for as many as 83% of all deaths, and 17% of \nthese are people less than 70 years old.5 \n \n4.  Health care delivery system. Health services are provided mostly by the public sector \nwith limited private sector contribution. The public sector provides 90% of inpatient care (more \nthan 7 million hospitalizations in 2019), about 55% of outpatient care (more than 58 million \noutpatient  visits  in  2019),  and  nearly  100%  of  preventive  care  which  includes  childhood \nimmunization, antenatal care, and family planning services. The government recognized the \nimportance of free preventive care and therefore established a field-based preventive care service \nsystem, with a dedicated preventive health staff. The country is divided geographically into 356 \n \n1  Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 2021. Annual Report 2020 (Special Statistical Appendix).

Noncommunicable Diseases (NCD) Country Profiles: Sri Lanka. Geneva. \n \n ", "2 \nhealth areas, managed by a medical officer of health, each with a defined catchment area that \ncoincides with the local administrative unit. \n \n5.  In parallel with the preventive care network, a geographically wide network of curative \nservices in three tiers (primary, secondary, and tertiary) is provided via 1,165 health facilities \nspread across the country. This includes 643 hospitals with 86,589 beds (four beds per 1,000 \npeople) and 522 facilities providing primary outpatient care services. About 74% of beds are in \nthe 116 secondary and tertiary care hospitals and 38 special hospitals (e.g., mental health, prison, \ncancer, and dental hospitals), while 26% are in the 489 divisional hospitals which provide primary \ncare.6 However, the availability of intensive care facilities is limited to about 600 beds (three \nintensive care unit beds per 100,000 people).7 People can access any level of curative facility \n(primary, secondary, or tertiary care hospitals) for first-contact care. A tier-wise referral system\u2014\nstarting from primary care facilities to higher facilities\u2014is not in place. The Ministry of Health \n(MOH) is responsible for the health system policy, planning, human resource training, stewardship \nfunctions,  and  tertiary  hospitals  while  nine  provincial  councils  manage  primary  and  most \nsecondary health care services. \n \n6.  COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 cases were first reported in Sri Lanka in January 2020. \nThe first wave of COVID-19 was during March\u2013June 2020, the second wave was during October \n2020\u2013March 2021, and an ongoing third wave has affected the country since 25 April 2021. As of \n23 August 2021, Sri Lanka had reported 390,000 confirmed cases and 7,366 deaths because of \nCOVID-19.8 The third wave continues to result in an unprecedented number of COVID-19 patients \nattending health facilities, and the effective reproduction rate during the third wave is markedly \nhigher than that during the first and second waves. Since April 2021, the number of daily new \nconfirmed cases has increased more than 350-fold, from 0.3 cases per million people to 106.0 \ncases per million people.9 The reported spread of new, more infectious variants has contributed \nto this significant increase. The speed of transmission of the virus and its virulence requires the \ncountry to ramp up testing, quickly identify and isolate cases, and effectively care for people with \nCOVID-19. \n \n7.  Constraints. Since 1990, evolving health challenges, including population aging, have \nled to prioritization of investments in secondary and tertiary health care at the expense of PHC \nservices. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the lopsided investment. Deterioration of \nPHC facilities has led to the bypassing of primary curative care services for secondary and tertiary \ncare for most health problems faced by the population. For example, secondary and tertiary health \ncare levels manage as much as 93% of childbirths, 75% of NCD patients, and 40% of outpatient \nservices. Preventive services (e.g., immunization) are well-managed at the PHC level, but for \nsome preventive care (e.g., nutrition services), demand-side intervention gaps exist (footnote 7). \n \n8.  Shared care clusters reform. In 2018, to improve PHC utilization, address overcrowding \nof secondary and tertiary care facilities, and ensure universal health coverage, the government \napproved a new health care delivery policy.10 The policy provides the implementation framework \nto transform the health care delivery model into a network of shared care clusters across the \ncountry to enable services that are more responsive, and patient centered. \u201cShared care\u201d in the \ngovernment\u2019s definition means (i) an individual's health care will be shared and form a continuum \n \n6  Government of Sri Lanka, MOH, Medical Statistics Unit. 2019.

Colombo. \n \n ", "3 \nbetween primary care and specialized services, and (ii) resources will be shared among health \ncare facilities within a cluster so that there is optimum availability and utilization (footnote 10). \nEach shared care cluster is structured around a secondary care facility (apex hospital) linking the \nPHC facilities (divisional hospitals and primary medical care units as feeder hospitals that will \nserve a defined catchment population). The apex hospitals will serve as the secondary curative \ncare facility for patients referred from PHC facilities within the cluster and provide a more \ncomprehensive service package to accommodate transfers and referrals from the smaller feeder \nhospitals in the cluster. The cluster approach ensures the continuum of care between primary and \nspecialist services for an individual patient over time and across an episode of care. \n \n9.  Original project. The original project became effective on 5 February 2019 and has three \noutputs: (i) PHC enhanced in Central, North Central, Sabaragamuwa, and Uva provinces; (ii) \nhealth information system and disease surveillance capacity strengthened; and (iii) policy \ndevelopment, capacity building, and project management supported. The four provinces that the \noriginal project is supporting were selected based on high poverty levels, health disparities, as \nwell as percentage of rural and estate sector populations. \n \n10.  As an immediate response to the COVID-19 pandemic, ADB approved a reallocation of \n$15 million from the loan and grant proceeds of the original project following a request by the \ngovernment in March\u2013April 2020.11 This financing has already been used or committed to \nimmediately procure essential medical and laboratory equipment and consumables, personal \nprotective equipment, and civil works for establishing laboratories for testing which are in line \nwith output 2 (health information system and disease surveillance capacity strengthened). The \nchanges did not materially alter or fundamentally affect the overall impact, outcome, or scope of \nthe original project. The design and monitoring framework was revised accordingly to reflect the \nchanges of expanding the project scope and the geographic areas. \n \n11.  The original project is evaluated as a well-performing project as (i) it is rated on track on \nADB\u2019s project performance rating system, (ii) safeguard covenants are fully complied with or are \nbeing complied with, (iii) the progress of outputs is on track, and (iv) management of risks is rated \nsuccessful. As of 18 August 2021, cumulative contract awards were $21.1 million (42.2%) and \ndisbursements, including advance financing, were $21.2 million (42.5%) against the net project \namount of $50.0 million and 44.8% of the elapsed time. The original project\u2019s closing date is 31 \nMay 2024. \n \n12.  Additional financing. Additional financing is the most appropriate and efficient modality \nto (i) provide the replenishment of reallocated funds for COVID-19 response approved in 2020 \n(footnote 11) to complete the originally planned activities related to PHC development, health \ninformation strengthening, and disease surveillance under the original project; (ii) scale up \nprimary and secondary health care through the shared care cluster approach and support e-\nlearning in the health sector with additional activities; and (iii) address the government\u2019s urgent \nfinancing requirements to support managing the ongoing third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe ongoing  implementation arrangements of  the original project will be continued, which \nensures a high degree of readiness for the implementation of the additional financing. The \n \n11 Funding for activities under the original project was reallocated to support Sri Lanka\u2019s COVID-19 response as per \nthe government\u2019s request in 2020. The reallocations were to support the development of 42 out of 135 identified PHC \nfacilities, provision of nutrition services to mothers and children in the estate and rural areas, renovation of 127 field \nhealth  centers,  conduct  of  a  behavior  change  communications  campaign  for  encouraging  PHC  utilization, \nprocurement  of  required  hardware  for  enabling  a  shared  care  cluster  information  technology  system,  and \nstrengthening the core capacity of selected ports of entry and the development of a quarantine information \nmanagement system. \n \n ", "4 \nadditional financing complies with the eligibility criteria for additional financing by ADB. With the \nadditional financing, the project continues to be technically feasible, economically viable, and \nfinancially sound. \n \n13.  The additional financing is classified low risk given that (i) the loan amount does not \nexceed $200 million; (ii) ADB has a positive track record of health sector interventions in the \ncountry; (iii) the executing agency has considerable capacity in externally financed project \nadministration; (iv) there are no known integrity concerns in the project; and (v) the proposed \nsafeguards categorizations continue to be B for environment, C for involuntary resettlement, and \nC for indigenous peoples. \n \n14.  Activities and outputs under the additional financing are accorded high priority by the \ngovernment and are aligned closely with the priorities identified in the government\u2019s development \nstrategy, the National Policy Framework Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour 2019. The framework \nintends to (i) ensure that the existing free health care system is further developed to reduce \nwaiting times, with special focus at the district level; (ii) expand the services available to patients; \n(iii) ensure that all hospitals are developed; and (iv) ultimately achieve universal health coverage \nas aligned with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3. The additional financing is in \nline with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Sri Lanka, 2018\u20132022 and country operations \nbusiness plan for Sri Lanka, 2021\u20132023.12 The additional financing is also consistent with ADB\u2018s \nStrategy 2030 operational priority (OP) 1: addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; \nOP 2: accelerating progress in gender equality and social inclusion; OP 3: tackling climate change, \nbuilding  climate  and disaster  resilience, and enhancing  environmental  sustainability; OP 5: \npromoting rural development and food security; OP 6: strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity; and OP 7: regional cooperation and integration.13 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: a healthier nation is ensured with a more \ncomprehensive PHC system. The project is aligned with the following outcome: efficiency, equity, \nand responsiveness of the PHC system improved. The impact, outcome and outputs are aligned \nwith the original project. The title of outputs 1 and 2 are adjusted to reflect the expanded scope. \n \n16.  Output 1: Primary and secondary health care enhanced in Central, North Central, \nSabaragamuwa, and Uva provinces. There are two sets of activities under the additional \nfinancing for this output. The first set are planned activities in the four provinces of Central, North \nCentral, Sabaragamuwa, and Uva under output 1 of the original project which were intended to \nbe implemented from 2021 but were placed on hold because of the reallocations of funds in 2020 \nfor emergency COVID-19 pandemic response which will now resume with the additional financing. \nThese activities include (i) developing 42 PHC facilities, (ii) expanding the package of nutrition \nservices to mothers and children with a special focus on the most vulnerable population in the \nestate and rural areas in the four provinces, (iii) renovating 127 field health centers, and (iv) \nsupporting a behavior change communications campaign for encouraging PHC utilization. \n \n17.  Considering the significant gaps in health care services of the  four provinces at the \nsecondary care level, the second set of activities under the additional financing for output 1 will \n \n12  ADB. 2017.

These activities include (i) upgrading nine base hospitals \n(one in each of the nine districts in the four provinces) through expanding the physical space, \nrepairing hospital facilities, and providing needed medical equipment to enable better secondary \ncurative care services to patients referred from PHC facilities within the respective cluster; and (ii) \nexpanding the existing PHC innovation fund to improve continuity of care, quality of care, and \ncomprehensiveness of the service package provided through the shared care cluster approach. \n \n18.  Output 2: Health information system, disease surveillance capacity, and COVID-19 \nresponse strengthened. There are also two sets of activities under the additional financing for \nthis output. The first set are the planned activities under output 2 of the original project which were \nplaced on hold because of the reallocations of funds in 2020 for emergency COVID-19 pandemic \nresponse which will now resume and be expanded with the additional financing. These activities \nare (i) procuring required  hardware  and establishing local area networks that interconnect \ncomputers within health facilities to pilot the adoption of health information technology (HIT) for \nbetter continuity of health care and disease surveillance within nine shared care clusters in the \nfour target provinces; and (ii) supporting the quarantine unit by further strengthening components \nunder the core international health regulation capacity for selected ports of entry and developing \na quarantine information management system. The adoption of HIT in the shared care clusters \nwill be implemented with a phased approach. The first phase will roll out the HIT solution in two \nselected shared care clusters; and the second phase will be implemented in the remaining seven \nshared care clusters subject to successful integration and implementation of the first phase. \n \n19.  With the third wave of COVID-19 reported since April 2021, the government requested \nthat  ADB  provides  further  support  to  strengthen  its  COVID-19  response  island-wide.  This \nconstitutes the second set of activities under the additional financing for output 2, which include \n(i) scaling up the capacity of at least 25% of secondary and tertiary care hospitals across the \ncountry to better manage COVID-19 patients by providing emergency medical equipment and \nsupplies; increasing intensive care, high dependency, and emergency treatment units; expanding \naccess to oxygen; and supporting transportation for home care, quarantine, and intermediate care \nservices; (ii) improving the quality of and access to laboratory testing services by supporting state-\nowned laboratories to carry out tests for COVID-19 detection, surveillance, and management, and \nconducting a feasibility study on increasing access to testing in rural and hard-to-reach areas \nthrough deployment of mobile laboratories; and (iii) enhancing the efficiency of the prehospital \nambulance system (1990 Suwa Seriya ambulance system) to link COVID-19 patients to the \ndesignated hospitals for further treatment and management without compromising the non-\nCOVID-19 emergency services. The last activity is financed by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction grant.14  \n \n20.  The additional activities (ii) and (iii) under output 2 will reach beneficiaries living in all nine \nprovinces of the country. The expansion of the geographic coverage will further complement the \nWorld Bank\u2019s ongoing COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health Systems Preparedness \nProject. The procurement of critical medical supplies and equipment to address the ongoing third \nwave of the pandemic under ADB additional financing is coordinated to ensure no duplication of \neffort with the support provided by the World Bank. \n \n21.  Output  3:  Policy  development,  capacity  building,  and  project  management \nsupported. On top of ongoing activities under the original project, the additional financing for \n \n14 $3 million project grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction was approved by the Government of Japan on \n25 August 2021. \n \n ", "6 \noutput  3  will  support  the  following  new  activities:  (i)  scaling  up  infrastructure,  information \ntechnology systems, and e-learning facilities in the National Institute of Health Sciences and nine \nselected regional training centers (one center per province) to enable facilitation of pre-service, \nin-service, and continuous medical education of health sector staff, (ii) developing a gender-\nresponsive PHC service module, a hospital design module, and PHC training modules, and (iii) \nsupporting policy development, capacity building, gender action plan implementation, and project \nmanagement and administration for the proposed 24-month project extension. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n22.  The additional financing brings value by (i) supporting the institutionalization of the shared \ncare cluster approach for health service delivery, which improves the efficiency and equity of \nhealth care in most underserved provinces; (ii) addressing the devastating COVID-19 pandemic \nthrough the timely provision of the most-needed medical and laboratory equipment and supplies \nto rapidly scale up the government\u2019s capacity to detect, treat, and manage incremental COVID-\n19 cases and reduce morbidities and fatalities from COVID-19; (iii) improving the efficacy, \ntimeliness, and safety of prehospital ambulance services for COVID-19-positive patients without \ncompromising the needs of non-COVID-19 patients; and (iv) enabling e-learning in the health \nsector to provide a safe and efficient way to build the capacity of people working in the health \nsector to address emerging health issues including COVID-19. The additional financing will \nstrengthen the health system through immediate as well as medium-term measures to address \nCOVID-19, creating synergy with the newly  approved Responsive COVID-19 Vaccines for \nRecovery Project under the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility. The project management unit \n(PMU) under the original project will be augmented to support the vaccination activities. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n23.  The additional financing is estimated to cost $123 million (Table 1). The revised overall \nproject cost, including the additional  financing, is  estimated  at $185 million.

The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction will provide a $3 million grant (2.44% of \nthe additional financing), to be administered by ADB. This grant will be used for expenditures in \nrelation to renovating ambulance stations, procuring ambulances, and delivering trainings to \nprehospital service personnel. The government will finance the remaining 8.13% ($10 million) for \nproject implementation of the additional financing, covering value-added tax and customs\u2019 duties. \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \n  Currenta    Additional Financing    Total \nShare of  Share of  Share of \nAmount  Total   Amount  Total   Amount  Total  \nSource  ($ million)  (%)    ($ million)  (%)    ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank                 \nOCR concessional loan  37.50  62.50    0.00  0.00    37.50  20.49 \nOCR regular loan  0.00  0.00    110.00  89.43    110.00  60.11 \nSpecial Funds resources  12.50  20.83    0.00  0.00    12.50  6.83 \n(ADF grant) \nJFPR grantb  0.00  0.00    3.00  2.44    3.00  1.64 \nGovernment of Sri Lanka  10.00  16.67    10.00  8.13    20.00  10.93 \n  Total  60.00  100.00    123.00  100.00    183.00  100.00 \nADF = Asian Development Fund, JFPR = Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, OCR = ordinary capital resources. \na  Refers to the original amount. \nb  Administered by the Asian Development Bank.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n26.  For the proposed additional financing, climate adaptation is estimated to cost $6.28 million \nand climate mitigation is estimated to cost $3.675 million. ADB will finance 100% of the adaptation \ncosts and 83% of the mitigation costs. JFPR will finance 17% of the mitigation costs. Details are \nin the PAM (footnote 15).  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n27.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 15). The original project implementation arrangements will continue for the \nadditional financing. The four established project implementation units (PIUs) under the provincial \ncouncils of Central, North Central, Sabaragamuwa, and Uva provinces will be the implementing \nagencies of activities under output 1 in their respective project areas. The implementation of \nactivities under outputs 2 and 3 will be centralized and managed by the existing PMU under the \n \n ", "8 \nMOH. The MOH will provide strategic guidance to the PMU, review the performance, and take \ntimely strategic measures required to achieve the project\u2019s outcome and outputs. The additional \nfinancing will be implemented over 4 years (2021\u20132025). The procurement (including consulting \nservices) to be financed by ADB will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from \ntime to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time \nto time). The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on implementation is reflected in the \nproject implementation period and corresponding cost estimates. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2021\u2013November 2025 \nEstimated completion date  30 November 2025 \nEstimated loan and grant closing date  31 May 2026 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  National project steering committee chaired by the secretary, MOH \n(ii)  Executing agency  MOH \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Provincial councils of Central, North Central, Sabaragamuwa, and Uva \nprovinces \n(iv) Implementation unit  Project management unit under MOH and project implementation units \nunder the four provincial councils \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding  1 contract (loan); 1  $3.76 million \n(internationally advertised)  contract (JFPR) \nOpen competitive bidding  21 contracts (loan)  $46.41 million \n(nationally advertised) \nRequest for quotations  24 contracts  $46.47 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  360 person-months  $2.16 million \nConsultants' qualification selection   270 person-months  $0.66 million \nIndividual consultant selection  246 person-months  $0.78 million \nRetroactive financing and advance  MOH requested retroactive financing of not more than 20% of the loan amount \ncontracting  as well as advance contracting to recruit consultants and procure urgent \nmedical and laboratory equipment, consumables, and vehicles to support the \nmanagement and treatment of the coronavirus disease.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n28.  The  additional financing will further strengthen  the  country\u2019s response to infectious \ndiseases, such as COVID-19, and other pandemics in the future by scaling up its disease \nsurveillance and treatment capacity. Such capacity will significantly reduce the risk of the ongoing \ndevastating pandemic by disrupting its local transmission chain and preventing further spread. It \nwill also strengthen the health system's resilience to better and cost-effectively address the health \ncare needs of vulnerable people through the shared care clusters and the improved functional \nlink for disease surveillance between the curative and preventive services. Moreover, the HIT \nsystem will improve the quality, efficiency, and continuum of curative health care services at the \nprimary and secondary levels of the health system. ADB is closely coordinating with the World \n \n ", "9 \nHealth Organization and other development partners to ensure that its financing and technical \nsupport under the additional financing will be provided in a coordinated and unduplicated manner. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n29.  An economic analysis was conducted in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on Economic \nAnalysis.16 The economic analysis considers direct benefits in both outputs 1 and 2 in terms of \nadditional productivity gains from disability-adjusted life years averted by reducing the impact of \nCOVID-19  and  other  communicable  diseases.17 The  cost  benefit  analysis  shows  that  the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) of additional financing is 28.9%. The economic analysis \nof the updated project as a whole (both the original project and the additional financing) was also \nconducted, yielding economic net present value of $158.9 million. Sensitivity analysis has also \nbeen carried out against the possible increase in updated project costs and decrease in benefits. \nIn the least-favorable scenario, the EIRR is 16.0%, indicating robust economic viability. The \nproject has no cost recovery component; hence, financial viability assessment is not required. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n30.  The additional financing is providing very much-needed financing to continue health care \ndelivery model reform while the government is facing budgetary constraints. Adopting the shared \ncare cluster approach will also improve the efficiency of public expenditures in the health system, \nas  currently  secondary  and  tertiary  health  care  facilities  are  overcrowded  and  therefore \noverstretched. The financial sustainability of the project was assessed. The sustainability of the \nproject investment depends on the country\u2019s fiscal resources, the government\u2019s commitment to \nthe health sector, and the adequacy of the MOH\u2019s recurrent budget. Despite the tight fiscal \nresources, the health sector remains at the top of the government\u2019s priorities and budgetary \nsupport has been strong. Securing PHC for all, with medical services that are matched with \ninternational standards, is one of the government\u2019s top priorities. There is an increasing trend in \nthe health sector budget allocations, with compound annual growth of 17.2% during 2015\u20132020, \ncompared with the total government budget growth of 6.7% in the same period. An evaluation of \nthe MOH\u2019s budget performance shows a compound annual growth rate of 20.7% for the recurrent \nbudget and 4.6% for the capital budget. Also, overall budget utilization rate is 91%, which \ndemonstrates that the MOH has the capacity and commitment to maintain its assets. The good \nhealth indicator outcomes reflect the effective and efficient use of resources in the health sector. \nThe estimated project incremental recurrent expenditures as a percentage of the government\u2019s \ntotal health sector budget are 0.17%, which is a relatively small amount, and the recipient entities \nshow capacity to sustain it. In addition, the government has provided assurances on (i) sufficient \nand timely counterpart funds in each fiscal year, and (ii) adequate funds to support the operation \nand maintenance of the project facilities through budget allocation to the executing agency during \nand after the project completion date. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n31.  Financial management. A financial management assessment has been conducted for \nthe project. The additional financing will use the original project financial management systems \nand  arrangements, for which  the MOH and  the implementing agencies have satisfactorily \nconformed with ADB\u2019s financial management requirements. All the actions outlined in the agreed \noriginal project financial management  action plans, including establishing  management and \n \n16 ADB. 2017. Guidelines on Analysis of Health Projects. Manila. \n17 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "10 \nimplementing units, recruiting an internal auditor, procuring accounting software, and setting up \na separate fixed asset register, have been satisfactorily complied with. The project\u2019s pre-mitigation \nfinancial management risk is rated moderate, mainly because of the budget allocation for the \nadditional financing which has not yet been made. The delays in release of funds may cause \npossible delays in project implementation. This risk will be mitigated through (i) establishment of \na separate budget code and timely budget allocation for the additional financing scope; and (ii) \nregular monitoring and reporting of the counterpart financing, which will be reported on as part of \nthe quarterly progress reports. \n \n32.  Procurement. An updated procurement assessment confirmed that the PMU and PIUs \nhave sound procurement track records. The PMU and the PIUs have experience in procurement \nfollowing ADB requirements. Procurement for major civil works, services, and equipment will be \nhandled by the PMU, and the PIUs will procure small works within the PHC innovation fund under \nthe  oversight  of  the  PMU.  The  procurement  system  is  accountable  and  transparent  but \nexperiences significant delays, and the overall procurement risk is moderate. To mitigate this risk, \nthe  project  will  implement  systematic  procurement  training  to  strengthen  staff  capacity  in \nprocurement and compliance  monitoring and monitor the procurement process through  an \nelectronic platform and report the delays to the steering committee. The project will also (i) engage \nadditional procurement staff, (ii) pursue the option to engage United Nations agencies to expedite \nprocesses, and (iii) improve procurement transparency by setting up a project-specific page on \nthe  MOH  website.  Value  for  money  procurement  will  be  achieved  by  selecting  the  most \nappropriate methods with careful packaging after consideration of, among others, the PMU\u2019s and \nPIUs\u2019 capacity, size, market, and location of the site. \n \n33.  Sri  Lanka  ranked  94th  of  180  countries  on  Transparency  International\u2019s  corruption \nperception index for 2020.18 The government has been strengthening its anticorruption framework, \nincluding enforcing existing anticorruption laws, further empowering institutions to deal specifically \nwith corruption, and implementing the 5-year Anti-Corruption Action Plan with the target of making \nSri Lanka a corruption-free nation by 2023. Integrity risks associated with the project are mostly \nfrom procurement. The procurement activities under the project will be closely monitored for any \nsystemic weaknesses by the internal auditors and will be strengthened with the measures \ndiscussed in para. 31. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  MOH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 15).19 \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  Poverty in Sri Lanka is more relative than absolute; 4.1% of the country\u2019s population are \ndeemed to be below the national poverty line while three of the four selected provinces show \nhigher poverty rates\u2014Central 5.4%, Sabaragamuwa 6.7%, and Uva 6.5%\u2014with North Central \nbeing lower than the national average at 3.3%. Despite inclusive development efforts, regional \ndisparities remain and are particularly evident in access, utilization, and service provision related \nto PHC. About 500,000 additional people are estimated to have fallen below the poverty line \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, with disproportionately large adverse impacts in Sabaragamuwa \nand Uva provinces where poverty rates are already higher than the national average.20 The \npandemic has also disproportionately affected women by exacerbating their care burden and \n \n18 Transparency International.

Capitalizing on the country\u2019s extensive PHC network, the \nproject will support poverty reduction and strengthen human capital. \n \n35.  The effective gender mainstreaming category of the original project remains. Out of 17 \ntargets in the original gender action plan, one has been completed and six are ongoing. The \ngender action plan has been updated with a few changes in the gender mainstreaming activities \nand targets reflecting expanded and new activities under the additional financing. The project \noutputs are designed to advance the access of both women and men to health services and \ninfrastructure, which in turn will help promote gender equality. Interventions include gender-\nresponsive facilities (separate toilets and private examination and changing rooms); a gender-\nresponsive  and  inclusive  essential  services  package;  sex-disaggregated  data  in  health \ninformation systems; and training for medical officers and PHC staff on gender sensitivity, gender-\nrelated policies, and interventions. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n36.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows. \n \n37.  Environment (category B). The environment safeguard category is the same as for the \noriginal project. The proposed civil works in the nine existing hospitals and ambulance facilities \ninclude physical expansion of up to about 22,500 square meters and refurbishment works. The \nenvironmental impacts are site specific and can be readily addressed through the adoption of \nmitigation  measures.  An  initial  environmental  examination,  including  an  environmental \nmanagement plan for the proposed subprojects, has been prepared based on a preliminary \ndesign. Consultations have been conducted using adaptive mechanisms (i.e., telephone and \nvirtual platforms) with project officials, health care staff, and health care facility users, and will \ncontinue during project implementation. The initial environmental examination will be updated \nbased on detailed design incorporating additional information on audit findings from the existing \nhospitals, will form part of the bidding and contract documents, and will be submitted to ADB for \nreview and disclosure. The environmental assessment and review framework prepared for the \noriginal project has been updated to reflect the additional scope and to enhance guidance in \nscreening, categorizing, and assessing subproject impacts, and for impact mitigation planning in \nthe event of unanticipated environmental impacts. \n \n38.  Compliance with environmental safeguard requirements in the original project has been \nsatisfactory, and risks are well-managed. The project-specific grievance redress mechanism has \nbeen established and has been functional. The same mechanism will continue for the additional \nfinancing.  The  environment  specialist  at  the  PMU  is  working  closely  with  the  appointed \nenvironment specialists in the PIU in monitoring environment safeguards implementation. The \nPMU will continue to submit semiannual environment safeguard monitoring reports to ADB for \nreview and disclosure. \n \n39.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The additional financing will not require land \nacquisition, and civil works for new building constructions, reconstruction, and refurbishment of \nexisting building will be done within government health facilities, which will not result in any \n \n21 T.

The ambulance stations that will be renovated are within the \npolice stations  and are on government-owned land, and there will also be no  involuntary \nresettlement impacts. An involuntary resettlement screening checklist has been included in the \nenvironmental assessment and review framework to screen each subproject after completion of \ndetailed designs. \n \n40.  Indigenous peoples (category C). Physical parameters of the project are confined to \nexisting health care facilities and are not located within or near indigenous people's domain. \nProject activities will not have any adverse impact on indigenous peoples and their communities. \nThe interventions do not directly target indigenous peoples as a group but may benefit individual \nindigenous peoples who seek medical assistance from these hospitals. \n \nG.

Because of the COVID-19 \npandemic, the initiation of the baseline survey was delayed, and the survey was completed in July 2021. The \nupdated baseline figures of outcome indicator \"a\" are much lower than the initially proposed figure, which is because \nthe unit of initially proposed figure is household. As the outcome indicator \"a\" aims to capture the increase in the \nnumber of individuals using outpatient services at PHC facilities instead of household, the mismatch of unit of \nmeasurement has been corrected in the updated baseline figures. \nbc Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Health, Epidemiology Unit. 2005.
