THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The proposed upgrade of health service delivery in Kiribati through the Kiribati Health \nInfrastructure and Systems Project (KHISP) will provide improved quality and coverage of health \nservices, particularly in South Tarawa, through investments in hospital infrastructure and health \nworker training. The following output areas are expected to be delivered: (i) health service delivery \nstrengthened, (ii) capacity to delivery essential care improved, and (iii) infection control practices \nstrengthened. The total indicative cost for the project is $27 million, of which $25 million is in Asian \nDevelopment Fund grant resources. The proposed project will be aligned with the investments \nmade in the health sector by the Government of New Zealand and the World Bank and address \nthe need to strengthen the building blocks of the health system. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TRTA) will provide technical analysis and \nassessments to assist the government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) develop the \nproposed KHISP. The TRTA is justified given the scope of activities and specialized nature of \nskills required for the project. The project preparation will also require consultations with various \nstakeholders such as private companies, development partners, and communities to ensure that \nit will be in line with the current and future demand for health service delivery. Due diligence will \nbe undertaken based on the proposed project design. The TRTA will also build the capacity of \nthe Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) to implement the ensuing project and \nenhance project readiness for timely implementation start-up given ADB\u2019s new engagement with \nMHMS. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for eleven small Pacific \nisland countries.1 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n3.  Output 1: Project scoping and design completed. This output will develop the project, \nincluding scoping and designing of key project components to meet the desired outcome of \nstrengthened health services to improve health outcomes in Kiribati. The project will focus on \nselected health facilities (Betio hospital and Tungaru Central hospital) together with broader \nhealth investments in national health standards and health workforce capacity. It will address key \ndesign issues and public health investments to improve infection control. The output will also \nidentify  other  investments  in  the  health  system  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  health \ninfrastructure including health service delivery management. At the same time, the scoping \nexercise will determine the most effective sequencing of outputs and strategic alignment and \ncollaboration with the ongoing investments in the health sector by other development partners \nincluding the Government of New Zealand and the World Bank. \n \n4.  Output 2: Project due diligence undertaken. The TRTA will support all required due \ndiligence based on the project design. It is expected to be done concurrently with finalizing the \nscope  as  some  findings  might  lead  to  adjustments  in  the  design  with  financial  and  cost \nimplications. Due diligence includes economic and financial assessment, poverty, social and \ngender analysis, environmental safeguards assessment and instruments, financial management \nand strategic procurement planning, risk assessment and management plans, cost estimates and \nfinancing plan and project implementation arrangements including monitoring and evaluation, \n \n1  ADB. 2021.

Based on these assessments and analyses, all the required project and linked \ndocuments will be prepared based on ADB requirements and standards. \n \n5.  Output 3: Support to project readiness and project management capacity of the \nimplementing agency. This output will support project preparation and readiness by providing \nfor an advisory role in finalizing the design of the project, overall implementation arrangements \nand  assessing  implementation  risks  and  recommending  effective  mitigation  measures,  in \ncoordination with key government and relevant industry stakeholders. This output also includes \nassisting the government during project start-up, such as preparation for the recruitment of a \nproject management unit, managing the mobilization period and preparing any draft bidding \ndocuments required and providing coordination support with key government agencies and other \nrelevant stakeholders such as sharing the outcome of the TRTA  and soliciting inputs and \nconcurrence where necessary. The capacity of the executing and implementing agencies for \nproject  preparation  and  implementation  will  also  be  strengthened.  Key  activities  include  \n(i) assessing the institutional set-up and identifying gaps with regards to project preparation and \nimplementation; and (ii) organizing training, capacity building exercises and activities to address \nidentified gaps and areas requiring improved capacity. \n \nTable 1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nMajor Outputs  Delivery Dates \nOutput 1: Project scope and design   \nProject scope and design including corresponding assessments and analysis  September 2022 \nOutput 2: Due diligence based on final project design   \nEconomic and financial analysis   \nFinancial management assessment, cost estimates, funds flow and financing plan   \nStrategic procurement planning including procurement capacity and risk   \nassessment and preparation of bidding documents if required    \nPoverty, social and gender analysis including gender action plan   November 2022 \nRisk assessment and management plans \nSafeguards due diligence and instruments  \nIntegrity due diligence \nSector assessment \nProject administration manual and consultancy requirements \nOutput 3: Support to project readiness and project management capacity of   \nthe implementing agency   \nAdvisory role to ensure effective project design and implementation arrangements   \nand coordination within the project steering committee.

The government will provide  the \nrest in the form of counterpart staff, office space, data, information, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1.
