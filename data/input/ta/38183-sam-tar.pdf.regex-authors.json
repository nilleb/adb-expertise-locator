INTRODUCTION \n1.  During high-level country consultations in Manila in February 2006, the Government of \nSamoa reconfirmed its request to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for a project preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  continue  its  support  for  the  power  sector.  The  Government \nrequested a strategic and long-term approach to the sector. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country \nstrategy and program update (CSPU) 2005\u20132006 for Samoa.1 Following the Government\u2019s \nrequest, a TA fact-finding mission was fielded to Samoa from 6 to 10 March 2006 and reached \nan  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  TA\u2019s  outcomes,  outputs,  financing  plan, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  outline  terms  of  reference.2 The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The TA will help the Government and the Electric Power Corporation (EPC) develop a \npower sector expansion program consisting of (i) a reform program to enable private sector \nparticipation  and  enhance  efficiency  in  the  sector;  (ii)  a program  to  reform  EPC\u2019s  internal \nbusiness and management processes to enhance governance and cost-efficiency of the utility; \nand (iii) preparation of a least-cost power sector investment plan to diversify the country\u2019s \nenergy resources, meet future load growth, and reduce the burden of diesel imports. The TA is \nexpected to lead to another TA to help implement the agreed reform program and an ensuing \nsector loan3 for EPC\u2019s power system expansion program. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Developing indigenous and renewable energy resources to reduce the economy\u2019s risk \nexposure to foreign exchange fluctuations and fuel price increases is a high development \npriority for the country and articulated in the Government\u2019s Statement for the Development of \nSamoa 2005\u20132007. Imports of petroleum products accounted for 15% of Samoa\u2019s total import \nexpenditure  in  FY2005.  EPC\u2019s  Corporate  Plan  (2005)  identifies  diversification  through \ndevelopment of indigenous and renewable energy resources as a key priority to reduce current \nreliance on diesel as the primary source of energy. Fuel is by far the single largest expense \nitem, representing 74% of total generation costs and 51% of EPC\u2019s overall costs. This leaves \nEPC, and ultimately electricity consumers, highly exposed to changes in world market oil prices \nand foreign exchange rates.  \n \n4.  In  2005,  ADB  assessed  EPC\u2019s  financial  management  performance.  The  findings \nindicated that EPC has struggled to improve its financial performance, primarily because of \ninadequate  cost  recovery  and  poor  revenue  collections.  The  assessment  also  proposed \nstrengthening  EPC\u2019s  management  and  corporate  governance  capabilities  to  enhance \ntransparency and cost-efficiency in the sector. EPC, as a corporate entity, has full autonomy of \nits daily operations and is governed by the Public Bodies (Performance and Accountability) Act \n(2001), but such autonomy has yet to be fully exercised. Improved business procedures and \nmanagement and corporate governance of EPC are essential for cost-effective and financially \nsustainable delivery of electricity services. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update 2005\u20132006: Samoa. Manila, where the TA was initially listed as \n\u201cSupporting Energy Sector Reforms\u201d ($300,000). \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities as \u201cPreparing the Power Sector Development Program\u201d on \n15 March 2006. \n3  The  proposed  financing  for  the  investment  plan  could  also  be  considered  under  a  multi-tranche  financing \nframework.   \n ", "2   \n5.  Tariffs are approved by the Cabinet. An automatic tariff adjustment mechanism was \nestablished through a Cabinet directive in 2001. The mechanism was intended to enable timely \ntariff adjustments through a transparent and depoliticized process. While the mechanism allows \nchanges in fuel prices and exchange rates to be automatically reflected in the tariff, it does not \nprovide incentives for EPC to improve its operational efficiency. However, tariffs have not been \nadjusted regularly as expected. The first tariff increase since November 2001\u201415% in May \n2005\u2014was approved by the Cabinet. \n \n6.  The lack of a regulatory and appropriate pricing framework hampers the power sector\u2019s \ncapacity to deliver adequate electricity services to end consumers. EPC is currently the sole \noperator, generator, and distributor of electricity through the grid. A regulatory environment \nconducive to private sector participation is essential to enhance the capacity to meet future \ndemand and improve sector efficiency.  \n \n7.  EPC\u2019s long-term planning capacity remains weak. EPC does not systematically forecast \ndemand  or  prepare  power  system  plans.  Individual  project  investments  are  planned  and \nimplemented ad hoc. While EPC\u2019s annual corporate plans indicate a list of investment projects \nplanned for the near future, investment needs are not accompanied by financing plans. Given \nrising oil prices and growing power demand, there is an urgent need (i) to develop a strategic \nand long-term approach to diversify power-generation sources, (ii) reduce system losses, and \n(iii) improve reliability.    \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA will (i) develop a power sector reform program to encourage private sector \nparticipation, including options for regulation; (ii) develop a program to reform EPC\u2019s internal \nbusiness and management procedures to enhance governance and cost-efficiency of the utility; \nand (iii) prepare a least-cost power sector investment plan to diversify energy resources, meet \nfuture  load  growth,  and  reduce  the  burden  of  diesel  imports.  The  success  of  this  TA  is \nenvisaged to lead to further TA support for reforms that will facilitate cost-efficient and reliable \nelectricity services to end consumers, and to an ensuing loan to support the power system \nexpansion program. The investment plan will help the country and EPC, and ultimately end \nconsumers, reduce exposure to global fuel prices by promoting indigenous and renewable \nenergy resources. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The sector structure, investment requirements, and regulatory and pricing framework \nneeds for Samoa\u2019s small open economy will be examined in detail to meet the reform objectives \nand  to  facilitate  private  sector  participation.  Advice  on  policy  matters  and  stakeholder \ncommunication will be provided throughout the TA. The TA will help the Government promote \nrenewable energy resources and private sector participation.   \n \n10.  The TA activities are grouped into three components:  \n \n(i)  Component 1 comprises the development of an agreed time-bound regulatory \nreform program for the power sector. This work involves (a) assessing options for \neffective  and  independent  regulation,  (b)  developing  a  legal  and  regulatory \nframework to implement the road map, (c) determining roles and functions of a \n ", "  3\nregulatory body, (d) developing an independent power producer framework, and \n(e) developing a tariff framework. The regulatory work involves a number of key \nstakeholders. It is important that the process of developing a regulatory road map \ninvolve  high-level  consultations  and  workshops  to  reach  consensus  on  the \noverall framework for reforms and the road map to implement it.  \n \n(ii)  Component 2 comprises the preparation of a reform program of EPC\u2019s corporate \ngovernance  arrangements,  and  internal  performance  management  and \nmeasurement structures and processes. The work will be highly consultative and \ninvolve the EPC board and management. EPC\u2019s reform program will focus on \nstrengthening governance arrangements in (a) the roles and functions of the \nEPC board versus management and development of procedures for decision \nmaking to enhance operational efficiency; (b) performance management and \nincentive  systems;  (c)  internal  planning,  budgeting,  and  procurement \narrangements, including a fuel audit; and (d) land acquisition, resettlement, and \nsocial development. \n \n(iii)  Component 3 includes the development of a prioritized least-cost power sector \ninvestment plan to meet growing demand and reduce the burden of fuel imports. \nThis work includes (a) demand forecasts and development of an optimized least-\ncost  plan,  including  identification  of  subprojects;  (b)  preliminary  design  of \nprioritized core subprojects; (c) assessment and projection of EPC\u2019s financial \nperformance; (d) financial and economic analyses of the investment program, \nincluding risk analysis; (e) preparation of environmental and social assessments \nto ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies; and (f) preparation of a \nclean  development  mechanism  screening  process  for  core  subprojects.  To \nfacilitate timely project implementation, bid documents for the core subprojects \nwill be prepared. \n \n11.  A hydropower scheme of 2\u20135 MW on Vaitai stream on Savai\u2019i, and an associated 22 kV \ntransmission line are envisaged to constitute the core subprojects. The power system on Savai\u2019i \nis isolated from the Upolu system, and project aims to replace unreliable diesel generation. A \nleast-cost  analysis  of  technically  feasible  hydropower  alternatives  will  be  conducted.  The \nfeasibility study will examine the technical and economic feasibility of an associated water \nsupply scheme. \n12.  Since individual subprojects\u2014some of which may not yield benefits if considered in \nisolation\u2014form part of a power sector investment plan, the economic and financial analyses of \nthe project will be conducted using a time-slice approach. A distributional analysis will be \nconducted  to  assess  the  distribution  of  net  benefits  and  cross-subsidies  across  key \nstakeholders. Risks and the implications of various delay scenarios of generation plants for \nfinancial and economic results will be analyzed. Financial due diligence and projections will be \nconducted with respect to EPC\u2019s financial performance, and financial performance measures \nestablished.  \n13.  To ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies on the environment, involuntary \nresettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples,  the  TA  will  review  EPC\u2019s  work  and  government \nprocedures and, if necessary, conduct supplementary detailed field surveys for core subprojects. \nTo identify environmental impacts and to prepare an inventory of all land and other affected \nassets and socioeconomic assessment of project-affected households, the surveys will cover (i) \nplanned generation sites, (ii) alignment of the transmission lines and sites of substations and \npower stations, and (iii) any necessary access roads. All information will be disaggregated by \n ", "4   \ngender. In accordance with ADB\u2019s policies, a resettlement plan (RP) will be prepared for core \nsubprojects and a resettlement framework (RF) to guide the preparation of subprojects under \nthe proposed loan. The RP will include (i) necessary compensation and income-restoration \nmeasures, (ii) the most suitable implementation arrangements, (iii) design of public information, \n(iv)  disclosure  and  grievance  procedures,  and  (v)  costing  of  compensation  and  income-\nrestoration measures. The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n14.  The TA will prepare an initial environmental examination in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003),  particularly  the  guidelines  for  environmental \nassessment  of  sector  loans.  Subprojects  will  be  assessed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  guidelines; \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures, including criteria for subproject selection, \nwill  be  established  for  subprojects  to  be  identified  under  the  loan.  The  environmental \nassessment will (i) review and evaluate the environmental soundness of the concept, approach, \nand prospective sites of the core subprojects; (ii) identify major environmental concerns; and (iii) \nexplore  mitigation  measures  and a  monitoring  plan.  Any adverse impacts identified  will be \nconsidered by the project design and implementation. A comprehensive estimation of the cost of \nmitigation measures and the associated environmental management plan is to be undertaken and \nincluded in the project cost estimates. Environmental assessment and the resulting environmental \nmanagement plans aim to prevent, reduce, or ameliorate adverse effects on the environment and \nthird parties. Field visits for data collection will be conducted and public consultations with local \ninterest groups will be undertaken to ensure that their views and concerns are considered in the \nproject design.  \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $885,000 equivalent. The Government of \nSamoa has requested ADB to finance $750,000 equivalent. $450,000 equivalent of the TA will \nbe financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program, and $300,000 equivalent of the \nTA will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Australia. The Government of Samoa \nwill finance the balance of the TA, equivalent to $135,000, by providing office accommodation \nand facilities and counterpart staff. The Government of Samoa has been informed that approval \nof the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The details of the cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will,  as  the  Executing  Agency,  have  oversight \nresponsibility over TA implementation. MOF will also be involved in policy discussions on the \nreform program. MOF has assigned EPC as the TA Implementing Agency. EPC will be involved \nin day-to-day activities of TA implementation and will nominate counterpart staff with adequate \ncapacity in engineering and power system planning, finance, environment, and social areas, \nbefore fielding of consultants. EPC will assign counterpart staff for field visits. EPC will also \nprovide  all  necessary  assistance  to  the  TA  consultants  in  liaising  with  other  government \nministries and agencies, and in obtaining necessary data and documentation, including maps \nfor routing of transmission lines and locations of feasible generation sites.  \n \n17.  A firm will be engaged to provide 19.5 person-months of international and 6.0 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services. The international team will consist of a regulatory \nexpert (3.0 person-months), a corporate governance and institutional development expert (2.0 \nperson-months),  a  financial  management  specialist  (2.0  person-months),  a  power  system \nplanner (3.0 person-months), a hydropower engineer (3.0 person-months), a renewable energy \n ", "  5\nexpert (1.5 person-months), a power economist (2.0 person-months), an environment specialist \n(1.5 person-months), and a resettlement specialist (1.5 person-months). The international team \nwill  be  supported  by  domestic  experts  in  engineering  (2  person-months),  environment  (2 \nperson-months), and resettlement (2 person-months). The firm will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by the Asian Development Bank and \nIts Borrowers. The domestic consultants will be associated with the international consultants. \nThe  firm  will  be  recruited  using  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures;  simplified \ntechnical proposals will be requested. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix \n4.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented with intermittent consultancy services over 8 months, from \nSeptember 2006 to May 2007. TA implementation will be monitored by ADB TA review missions \nand  regular  communications  with  MOF,  EPC,  and  the  team  of  consultants.  Close \ncommunication with the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) will take \nplace throughout the TA. At the initial stage of the TA, a meeting of the consultants, EPC, \nAusAID,  and  ADB  will  discuss  the  consultants\u2019  work  and  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  requirements. \nReporting arrangements will include submission of (i) an inception report within 4 weeks after \nservices start; (ii) an interim report within 2 months of fielding of the consultants, which will be \ndiscussed at a meeting of the consultants, EPC, AusAID, and ADB; and (iii) a draft final report to \nbe discussed during a second quadripartite meeting with EPC, AusAID, and ADB. The final \nreport, incorporating comments of EPC, AusAID, and ADB, will be submitted within 3 weeks of \nreceiving comments. The consultants will prepare status reports for their specific scope of work, \nhighlighting any issues that could become critical for the timely TA completion. The consultants \nwill prepare a stand-alone document for a 10-year road map for the power sector, including \ninvestment plans and requirements, regulatory reforms, and corporate governance reform of \nEPC. The report should be suitable for publication by ADB. \n \n19.  Specific  reporting  arrangements,  dissemination,  and  workshops  will  apply  to  the \nregulatory and corporate governance work. Emphasis will be placed on consultations and the \ninteractive process with stakeholders. The regulatory expert will first prepare an inception report \noutlining the detailed work plan. The consultants will prepare reports that describe the scope \nand terms of reference of work required on specific tasks under the reform program. They will \nalso prepare a final report that summarizes the recommended and agreed reform program and \nassociated time-bound road map to implement it. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $450,000  on  a  grant  basis,  to  the  Government  of  the \nIndependent State of Samoa for preparing the Power Sector Expansion Program, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved  Economic growth  Gross domestic product   \u2022  Political stability \nmacroeconomic      \u2022  Stable or reduced fuel \nmanagement through  Reduced fuel imports  Trade data  prices \nreduced exposure to      \u2022  Stable exchange rates \nforeign exchange rate      \u2022  Environment conducive \nmovements and global      to private sector \nfuel prices      participation \n     \n\u2022  Effective stakeholder \nImproved electricity  Consumption data  EPC consumer base data \nconsultations \nservices to all     \n\u2022  Capacity to mitigate \nconsumers     \nsocial and \n     \nenvironmental impacts \nImproved capacity of  EPC\u2019s power system  System\u2019s operations reports \neffectively and on time \nthe sector to meet  expansion program   \n \ndemand growth    Asian Development Bank \n    (ADB) review missions \nDiversification of  Private sector \n \nenergy sources  participation \nEPC\u2019s annual reports \n   \nImproved use of  Generation capacity by   \nindigenous and  source  EPC\u2019s audited financial \nrenewable energy    accounts \nresources   \n   \nElectric Power  EPC\u2019s cost data \nCorporation (EPC) and   \nend consumers   \nbecome less exposed \nto movements in \nforeign exchange rates \nand global fuel prices \nOutcome      Assumptions \nPower sector reform  Memorandum of    \u2022  Sustained Government \nprogram, reform  understanding signed  commitment to reforms  \nprogram of EPC\u2019s  between the  \u2022  Least-cost indigenous \ninternal business and  Government and ADB  resources \nmanagement   \nprocedures, and least-\ncost investment plan for \nthe power sector, \nincluding feasibility \ndesign of core \nsubprojects agreed by \nthe Government and \nADB \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Samoa: \n \nThe Government has identified the development of indigenous energy resources as a key priority for diversifying \neconomic growth. Increased private sector foreign and local investments are critical for sustainable economic growth \nand for increasing jobs. Reliable power supply is important for continued diversification of the production base, which \nwill create jobs and increase productivity in agriculture and the service sectors. \n \nSamoa is a small open economy, highly vulnerable to global energy prices. Diesel comprises about 15% of total \nimports. Increased use of indigenous resources will reduce the impact of increased energy prices on the trade balance \nand thus help improve external balances and economic growth.  \n \nWhile about 95% of the population in Samoa has access to electricity, poor service delivery has significantly \ncontributed to hardship.a Much of the service industry relies on high-cost captive power as backup. The poor quality of \nsupply hampers economic growth and job creation. \n \nWith recent hikes in energy prices, the pressure on increases in power tariffs has intensified. The poor spend a larger \nshare of their income on fuel and energy, including electricity, than the nonpoor. The fiscal space to support subsidies \nto the poor is very limited. Diversification toward indigenous and renewable energy resources will help reduce the \npressure on tariff increases in the longer term and possibly avoid the opportunity cost of fiscal expenditure on power \nsubsidies to make energy affordable for the poor.   \n \nThe poor quality and unreliable supply of power disproportionately burden the poor, who are less able to resort to cost-\neffective alternative sources of power, and have a direct impact on expenditure for electricity and often greatly \ninconvenience users, particularly women. Any jobs foregone because of poor and unreliable supply can also have a \nmajor impact because the loss of one income source may have larger impacts for the poor than for the nonpoor. The \npoor mention poor power delivery as a major hardship (footnote a).   \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe poverty analysis will be an integral part of the social and participatory analysis and focus on vulnerability, \nparticularly to fuel and energy prices. The Electric Power Corporation\u2019s (EPC) disaggregated consumer base data, \ntariff blocks, and cross-subsidies will be assessed through the economic and financial analyses. A distribution analysis \nof net benefits and subsidies will be conducted across key stakeholders. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nEPC has consulted some stakeholders affected by the core subproject, the Vaitai hydropower scheme. However, \nfurther consultations and stakeholder analysis are required. The stakeholder analysis, as part of the economic and \nsocial assessments, will mainly be qualitative.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nA full participation strategy shall be designed under the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) and will be \nimplemented before and during construction. The strategy shall include ongoing consultations on the project with \naffected people throughout the TA, disclosure of public information, compensation and resettlement, and grievance \nprocedures. \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n \nD.
