The  regional  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  consistent  with  the \nSouth Asia regional cooperation strategy, 2011\u20132015, which places high priority on regional \nconnectivity and trade facilitation projects.1 The TA was conceptualized following consultations \nconducted for the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) trade facilitation \nduring October  2012\u2013March  2013.  It  was  included  in the  South  Asia regional  cooperation \noperations business plan, 2013-2015.2 \n  \n2.  At the meetings of the SASEC trade facilitation and transport working group (TFTWG) in \n2010\u20132012, the governments of SASEC countries3 requested continued support from the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  on  SASEC  trade  facilitation.  ADB  approved  in  November  2012 \nSASEC Trade Facilitation Program loans and grants to Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal to help \ndevelop modern customs administrations, streamline regulations and procedures, and provide \nimproved services and information to traders.4 In addition, at the SASEC TFTWG meeting held \nin Thimphu, Bhutan, in November 2012, SASEC country delegations (i) agreed to expand \nassistance to trade facilitation further through additional TA to ensure full support for ongoing \ninitiatives and (ii) requested ADB to explore the possibility of providing TA to respond to the \nspecific trade facilitation needs of SASEC countries.  \n \n3.  The inception meeting of the SASEC customs subgroup, which was held on 28 March \n2013, broadly agreed on a work plan of priority issues and activities and on the expected impact \nand outcome of the TA, supporting its design and implementation. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.5  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  South Asia is among the least economically integrated regions in the world. In 2011, only \n5% of South Asia\u2019s trade is intraregional, compared with over 26% in Southeast Asia and 54% \nin East Asia. Despite progress made since 2005 in facilitating inland and cross-border trade\u2014\nshortening the time it takes on average for exports to clear customs from 35 days in 2007 to \nless than 33 days in 2011\u2014trade impediments remain. They include the (i) large number of \ndocuments required for border clearance, (ii) lack of streamlined customs and other border \nprocedures,  and  (iii)  lack  of  efficient  and  modern  customs  facilities.  Consequently,  border \ncrossings in South Asia are among the most congested in the world. It takes 32.4 days to export \nfrom South Asia, compared with 23.1 days from East Asia and the Pacific.6 These issues are \nshared to varying degrees by all four SASEC countries. As such, a subregional approach of \nsharing experiences and technical cooperation among them is an effective way to address \nthese issues. \n \n5.  Limited  customs  cooperation.  SASEC  customs  cooperation  has  been  subsumed \nunder a broader committee\u2014the TFTWG\u2014and has been addressing general aspects of trade \nfacilitation. One result, however, has been a lack of focus on regional policy coordination on \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2011.

Doing Business. http://www.doingbusiness.org \n ", "2   \nspecific customs matters such as customs management and administration procedures. Many \nimpediments remain, such as  \n(i)  processes across countries that are not harmonized,  \n(ii)  excessive inspection at borders,  \n(iii)  multiple transshipments due to limited or lacking transit rights, and  \n(iv)  uncertain and expensive cargo clearance.  \n \n6.  Weak  capacity  to  comply  with  international  best  practices.  Trade  facilitation \nmeasures  are  numerous. They  have  become  increasingly  more  complex  and  technical  as \ncomputers and information and communication technology (ICT) have proliferated in customs \nreform and modernization, signaling a permanent shift in global customs management. In this \ncontext, the introduction of international customs best practices is relatively new in South Asia. \nAwareness and appreciation of such practices are in their infancy. The situation is compounded \nby a shortage of skills necessary to modernize customs procedures.  \n \n7.  Different  degrees  of  customs  automation.  Most  South  Asian  countries  have \nautomated customs systems, but they are limited to different degrees. As countries prepare to \ncomply  with  international  standards  and  to  implement  ICT  solutions,  they  can  proceed  at \ndifferent speeds and in different sequence, adopt different platforms and standards, and vary in \nthe extent of sector coverage. While trade flow can improve within borders, regional trade can \nbe facilitated optimally only if national customs administration systems are able to communicate \nefficiently.  Other  important  issues  pertain  to  legal  jurisdiction,  national  and  regional  policy \nsequencing, and different kinds of ICT infrastructure and degrees of preparedness to automate \ncustoms.  \n \n8.   The TA will address these issues by supporting the implementation of trade facilitation \nin Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The Maldives and Sri Lanka, \nwhich are not SASEC countries, will participate in knowledge-sharing activities, as their trade-\nfacilitation problems are similar to those of SASEC countries. Their participation aligns with the \nregional cooperation strategy for South Asia, which covers not only the SASEC program, but \nother regional cooperation programs involving all South Asian countries (footnote 1).  \n \n9.  The TA will build on an ongoing subproject that is building capacity for SASEC trade \nfacilitation  with  funding  from  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development.7 It  will \ncomplement  the  planned  TA  projects  in  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  and  Nepal,  supporting  their \nparticipation in SASEC trade facilitation, and helping implement the SASEC Trade Facilitation \nProgram loans and grants (footnote 4). \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be more efficient, transparent, secure, and service-oriented \nprocessing of cross-border trade in South Asia. Progress will be indicated by (i) shorter average \ntimes required for export and import and (ii) the percentage of shipments \u201cgreen channeled,\u201d or \nnot physically inspected in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. The outcome will be modern and \neffective customs administration and management in participating countries.  \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2006. Establishing the Australia\u2014ADB South Asia Development Partnership Facility. Manila. The Subproject \n(SASEC Transport and Trade Facilitation Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening), with a budget of \n$1,175,000, will support program implementation in key areas. \n ", "  3 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will have two outputs: (i) enhanced cooperation between and among customs \nagencies in South Asia and (ii) an interface framework for customs administration systems in \nSASEC countries.  \n12.  Enhanced cooperation between and among customs agencies in South Asia. The \nSASEC TFTWG has emphasized the importance of cooperation among customs agencies in \nthe four SASEC countries as part of efforts to facilitate trade in the subregion. A customs \nsubgroup of the SASEC TFTWG was established in March 2013 to serve as a platform for \nincreased  cooperation.  The  TA  will  support  meetings  of  the  customs  subgroup  and  the \nparticipation of customs officials in SASEC countries and international experts who will serve as \nresource persons helping to prepare and facilitate the meetings. The meetings of the customs \nsubgroup  will  serve  as  venues  at  which  SASEC  countries  share  their  experiences  of \nimplementing customs reform and modernization as promoted under SASEC and explore ways \nto harmonize and streamline customs information and processes to facilitate trade within the \nsubregion. The TA may also support analytical studies on priority customs issues in SASEC, \nwhich will be agreed by the customs subgroup. \n13.  The TA will assist in conducting subregional workshops and seminars at which South \nAsian  countries  can  exchange  experiences  and  share  information  on  international  good \npractices in implementing priority  customs reform measures in line with the revised Kyoto \nConvention, the so-called SAFE framework of standards to secure and facilitate global trade, \nand the application of ICT in customs. ADB will forge a partnership with the World Customs \nOrganization (WCO) Asia Pacific Regional Office for Capacity Building and with the Customs \nand  Tariff  Bureau  of  Japan\u2019s  Ministry  of  Finance  toward  organizing  and  conducting  these \nworkshops and seminars. \n \n14.  Interface framework for customs administration systems in SASEC countries. As a \npilot initiative of customs cooperation, the TA will help develop an interface framework for \ncustoms  administration  systems  between  and  among  SASEC  countries.  The  four  SASEC \ncountries  are  investing  in  automated  customs  management  and  administration  systems  to \npromote streamlined and transparent trade processes and procedures. They have, to varying \ndegrees, expressed interest in establishing national single windows. As a first step, the TA will \nsupport  studies  and  consultations  to  (i)  identify  the  benefits  of  promoting  the  interface  of \ncustoms  administration  systems  and  inform  the  countries  about  them;  (ii)  determine  the \nassociated issues and challenges to be addressed; and (iii) formulate a strategy and road map \nfor a feasible process of creating a better customs administration interface, which will be tackled \nas  part  of  the  SASEC  customs  subgroup  agenda.  International  customs  administration \nspecialists will be engaged to help develop this framework. The Customs and Tariff Bureau of \nJapan and the WCO Asia Pacific Regional Office for Capacity Building will be consulted in the \npreparation of the framework. \n \n15.  The potential risks to attaining the TA\u2019s expected impact, outcome, and outputs arise \nfrom political instability and exogenous economic shocks that might affect the subregion, the \nlack of capacity  in border agencies to implement trade facilitation reform, and the lack of \ncommitment on the part of SASEC customs agencies to ensure the active and continuing \nparticipation of senior officials in all the activities of the SASEC customs subgroup. \n \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million and will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from August 2013 to July 2015. The ADB \nSouth Asia Department (SARD) will be the executing agency. ADB will work with the WCO in \nimplementing the TA.8 Building on a training needs assessment workshop held on 28 March \n2013 in Bangkok, tentative training programs have also been identified for 2013 on authorized \neconomic  operators,  a  WCO  compendium  on  a  national  single  window  for  South  Asian \ncountries, valuation, and time release studies.  \n \n18.  WCO  officials  will  share  their  semiannual  capacity-building  programs  with  SARD \nregularly to better synchronize the training programs of both institutions in the future. SARD will \ncoordinate and regularly share information with the Customs and Tariff Bureau of the Ministry of \nFinance of Japan.  \n \n19.  The TA will require (i) trade facilitation specialists (international, 30 person-months); \n(ii) resource  persons  (international,  3.5  person-months),  who  will  build  capacity  to  discuss \ninternational good practices and provide advice on specific TA outputs; and (iii) trade facilitation \ncoordinating analysts (national, 34 person-months). \n \n20.  Individual  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  line  with  their  specific  expertise  and  the \ndiversity of tasks to be undertaken, under the active management of SARD staff. Consultants \nwill be engaged as individuals in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n21.  Workshops, trainings, and seminars will be held during implementation. All procurement \nof goods and other services under the TA will accord with ADB Procurement Guidelines (2013, \nas amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will accord with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n22.   The TA will be monitored principally through meetings of the SASEC TFTWG, the \nSASEC customs subgroup, and national and regional meetings to be held under the auspices of \nthe TA. TA outputs will be evaluated by SARD through the annual TA implementation review \nmission with the assistance of the ADB resident missions.  \n \n23.   Good practices and lessons from the TA will be (i) documented in the progress reports \nsubmitted to SASEC TFTWG and posted in the SASEC website (www.sasec.asia) and (ii) \nreported  during  meetings  of  the  ADB\u2019s  regional  cooperation  and  integration  community  of \npractice. \n \n                                                \n8  On 25 January 2013, SARD and the WCO agreed on six themes for capacity building in South Asian countries: \n(i) general annex provisions of the Revised Kyoto Convention, (ii) the SAFE framework of standards, (iii) authorized \neconomic operators, (iv) risk management, (v) post clearance audit, and (vi) time release studies. \n ", "  5 \nIV.
