INTRODUCTION \n1.  At  the  request  of  the  Government  of  Mongolia,  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nReforming Higher Education for a Knowledge Society1 was included in the 2009\u20132012 country \noperations business plan for Mongolia.2 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) undertook a TA \nfact-finding  mission  in  February  2010,  and  agreement  was  reached  with  the  Ministry  of \nEducation, Culture and Science (MECS) on the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, costs and \nfinancing, implementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference for consulting services. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Government of Mongolia considers reforming higher education as one of the key \ninstruments to accelerate economic growth. The government intends to establish a higher \neducation  system  that  will  meet  international  standards  by  producing  graduates  who  can \ncompete successfully in an increasingly globally oriented economy. The growth of extractive \nsectors  will  provide  Mongolia  with  resources  for  further  economic  development.  However, \nwithout  a  well-developed  higher  education  system,  the  country's  youth  will  not  be  able  to \ncompete  globally  and  the  economy  will  remain  narrowly  based.  In  February  2008,  the \ngovernment launched a long-term National Development Strategy until 2020,3 which highlights \nthe need to strengthen the country\u2019s higher education. In 2009, the newly elected government \nemphasized  the  importance  of  developing  a  globally  competitive  education  system  for \nMongolia's economic growth and outlined the government's priorities in education, top among \nwhich is the need to reform higher education. The government\u2019s revised education sector \nmaster plan4 has set the twin goals of establishing a higher education system that meets \ninternational standards and transforms Mongolia into a knowledge economy. However, in the \npast,  the  government's  focus  on  higher  education  has  not  been  matched  by  the  funding \nnecessary to undertake higher education reforms.  \n3.  Changes in higher education since Mongolia began its transition to a market economy in \nearly  1990s  have  included  deregulation  and  a  rapid  increase  in  private  higher  education \ninstitutions (HEIs), a considerable increase in student enrollments over the last 15 years, and \nsignificant changes in government funding. However, most of these reforms were piecemeal \nand ad hoc. Higher education net enrollment among the population in the age group of 18\u201324 \nyears is 34.9%. In 2007, 17.3% of the labor force had benefited from higher education.5 Thus, \nthere is now an urgent need to undertake an extensive and systematic, yet politically feasible, \nreform of the higher education system. \n \n4.  Governance and management. By 2009, the number of HEIs increased to 146, of \nwhich  around  100  were  private  (some  universities'  total  student  population  is  under  100 \nstudents),  to  the  detriment  of  the  overall  quality  of  higher  education.  Given  Mongolia\u2019s \npopulation  of  2.5  million,  rationalizing  HEIs  to  improve  economies  of  scale  and  prevent \nduplication of facilities has become imperative. In 2010 the government initiated consolidation of \nHEIs by merging state-owned universities, colleges, and institutions to increase efficiency and \neconomies of scale. With the newly consolidated public HEIs, the government needs support in \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 April 2010. \n2  ADB. 2009.

Master Plan to Develop Education of Mongolia in 2010\u20132020. Ulaanbaatar (under \npreparation). \n5  MECS estimates. \n ", "2   \ndetermining  how  to  streamline  them  in  terms  of  specializations  offered;  the  number  and \nqualifications  of  faculty;  student  transfer  mechanisms;  consolidation  of  facilities,  including \nlibraries, laboratories, and other facilities; and financing and management arrangements. Other \nkey challenges in governance and management include insufficient autonomy delegated to \nHEIs at the institutional level, as the government caps university fees, imposes student quotas, \nand controls governance structures. Enhancing the institutional autonomy of HEIs would require \nreassessment of the role of MECS in overseeing the higher education sector. Relatively few \ninstitutions provide specific management training for senior officers in HEIs.  \n \n5.  Declining quality and efficiency. A university accreditation system has been in place \nsince 1998; however, this system is not obligatory and is considered to be weak in terms of the \nassessments performed. The current accreditation system in Mongolia has very little effect on \nthe public funding received by an institution. Since Mongolia\u2019s economic transition began in the \nearly 1990s, small private universities have proliferated, and this has often been detrimental to \nthe overall quality of this subsector. To address quality and efficiency concerns, the government \nis planning to rationalize private HEIs by strengthening accreditation of private universities and \nby offering government support to the small private HEIs to convert into technical and vocational \neducation and training institutions. \n \n6.  Financing of higher education. In 1994, the government began requiring public HEIs \nto charge tuition fees at levels that would cover the entire cost of academic staff salaries, thus \ngenerating  a  large  reduction  in  the  government\u2019s  higher  education  budget.  However,  the \ngovernment regulates tuition fees, and by keeping them low, prevents HEIs from accumulating \nsavings. Moreover, the government is not fulfilling its legal obligation to provide public HEIs with \nsufficient recurrent funding to cover utility and operation and maintenance costs. Nor has it \nprovided any policy support with regard to the \"shortfall\" in tuition fees. As a result, there has \nbeen a proliferation of private providers who have largely focused on low investment, high return \nprograms, and this has led to a decline in the standard of higher education.  \n \n7.  Student grants and loans. The government\u2019s provision of grants and loans to students \nin accredited HEIs needs to be strengthened. The State Training Fund (STF) was established in \n1994 to support capable but disadvantaged students, including children of herders, orphans, \ndisabled students, and students from families who have three or more children enrolled in HEIs. \nThe fund is allocated annually in the national budget and is based on training area priorities \nestablished by MECS. However, 47% of the fund is used as scholarship support for one child of \nevery civil servant, leaving insufficient funds for those identified as disadvantaged. According to \na World Bank study, only 2% of the STF loans are paid back, and so the government is, in effect, \nsubsidizing the full cost of these loans, thereby reducing the amount available for other types of \nsupport to HEIs. The government needs support to reform the STF to ensure its efficiency, \ntransparency, and accountability.  \n \n8.  University admissions and examination system. To improve the current method of \nawarding STF grants and loans, the government has made it a priority to develop a nationwide \nassessment  instrument  for  university  admissions.  This  instrument  will  be  based  on  good \ninternational practices for measurement and assessment of post-secondary learning, including a \nuniversity admissions examination. In view of this reform of the university admissions process, \nthe broader reform of the STF will need to be undertaken in phases. The TA will provide key \npolicy recommendations on governance, management, and financing of the higher education \nsector, in addition to supporting development of a national university admissions examination.  \n ", "  3\n9.  Higher education reforms. The government has begun reforming the institutional and \norganizational structure of HEIs by merging state-owned universities, colleges, and institutions \nto increase efficiency and economies of scale. As a result, effective 1 July 2010 the number of \nstate-owned (public) universities, colleges, and institutes has been reduced from 42 to 16. The \ngovernment  is  developing  plans  to  build  a  completely  new  university  campus  outside \nUlaanbaatar,  designed  and  staffed  to  meet  an  acceptable  international  standard.  The \ngovernment has established six working groups to reorganize the consolidated universities, to \ndevelop a higher education sector road map,6 and to guide the development of a new university \ncampus.  The  government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  support  in  developing  and \nimplementing these important reforms.  \n10.   ADB\u2019s assistance to the education sector. ADB has provided assistance to basic and \nsecondary education since 1991. As of December 2009, ADB had approved 4 loans amounting \nto $42.5 million, 2 Asian Development Fund grant projects totaling $27 million, plus 10 TA \ngrants totaling $4.4 million, and 3 Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and Japan Fund for \nInformation and Communication Technology grant projects in the amount of $5 million for the \nsector.  The  recent  country  assistance  program  evaluation  report7 on  ADB's  assistance  in \nMongolia rated ADB's assistance in education as highly successful. Given Mongolia\u2019s evolving \nneeds, ADB\u2019s strategies in education are shifting beyond basic education, to vocational and \nhigher education to promote broad-based and inclusive growth.8  ADB is implementing a project \npreparatory TA for Strengthening Higher and Vocational Education (footnote 6), with an ensuing \nproject9 scheduled for 2011 approval. This TA will be coordinated closely with the project \npreparatory TA to address urgent and priority reform areas before the start of the ensuing \nproject. For instance, the reform of the STF would be an area of coordination between this TA, \nand the project preparatory TA and its ensuing project. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA is the improved quality, relevance, and management of higher \neducation in Mongolia. The outcome of the TA will be a comprehensive analysis of the choices \nfor improving the quality, relevance, and management of higher education in Mongolia.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The main TA output will be key policy recommendations on measures and mechanisms \nfor improving higher education in Mongolia. The policy recommendations will be drawn from the \nanalysis and assessment of the key issues examined in the main TA report, including (i) the \nhigher  education  policy  environment  and  proposed  financing  and  governance  reforms,  (ii) \ncurrent constraints and efficiency issues, (iii) rationalization of HEIs to ensure efficiency and \neconomies of scale, (iv) strengthening the effectiveness and capacity to manage the STF and \nimproving the targeting of financial assistance to disadvantaged groups, (v) development of a \n                                                 \n6  The ADB-financed project preparatory TA (ADB. 2009.

These policy measures and \neffective mechanisms for implementation will be identified, prioritized, and costed. The policy \nrecommendations  will  also  incorporate  the  findings  of  the  project  preparatory  TA  for \nStrengthening Higher and Vocational Education.  \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 11 months in two phases.  \n \n(i)  Phase 1, lasting 6 months, will comprise: (a) reviewing higher education policies \nand strategies in Mongolia based on a rapid assessment and review of recent \nhigher education policy recommendations by the World Bank, ADB, the United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP), and other relevant organizations; (b) \nassessing the feasibility of higher education reforms currently proposed by the \ngovernment;  (c)  identifying  challenges  and  opportunities  to  improve  HEIs, \nincluding a labor supply and demand analysis, economic growth projections, a \npolicy analysis, and an analysis of the capacity of HEIs; (d) organizing overseas \nstudy  tours  to  review  effective  higher  education  models;  (e)  conducting \nmultistakeholder  consultations  on  the  proposed  higher  education  reforms, \nincluding supporting workshops and seminars for six higher education working \ngroups established by the government; (f) organizing a conference on secondary \nand  tertiary  education  reforms;  (g)  developing  and  implementing  a \ncommunication strategy targeted to key stakeholders about the importance and \nbenefits  of  proposed  higher  education  reforms  through  advocacy  and  media \nrelated activities; and (h) reviewing, publishing, and disseminating the revised \neducation sector master plan (footnote 4) and other relevant knowledge products.  \n(ii)  Phase 2, lasting 5 months, will comprise: (a) preparing recommendations for \nfinancing and governance reforms in higher education, through a participatory \napproach  and  in  collaboration  with  the  ADB-financed  TA  consultants  for \nStrengthening Higher and Vocational Education; (b) preparing recommendations \nfor  developing  a  university  entrance  and  high  school  graduation  exam;  (c) \npreparing recommendations for strengthening the STF; (d) organizing a series of \nstakeholder consultations in  Mongolia to share preliminary findings and develop \nthe main TA report; (e) organizing a final review workshop to present key TA \nfindings; (f) preparing knowledge products as discussed in para. 14; and (g) \ndeveloping a final report.  \n \n14.  Study tours will be undertaken at an early stage in TA implementation. Participants will \nbe officials from the central government, including MECS senior officials and selected members \nof Parliament and university presidents who develop and implement policies relating to higher \neducation. The tours will allow these key officials to (i) observe good practice in countries with \neffective  higher  education  systems  such  as  Canada,  the  People's  Republic  of  China,  the \nRepublic  of  Korea,  Singapore,  or  the  United  States;10 and  (ii)  exchange  experiences  and \nlessons learned with officials from other countries. Three workshops and a conference will be \nheld. The workshops will serve as a platform for (i) sharing TA findings at various stages, (ii) \nbuilding consensus among TA stakeholders, and (iii) obtaining feedback for improving the TA \nwork and findings. The workshops will be issue-oriented and are tentatively scheduled at the \nstart of the TA, halfway through the TA, and towards the end of the TA. The conference will be \nheld during phase 1 of the TA and will bring together international and national experts in \nsecondary and tertiary education reform. The TA outputs will include the following knowledge \n                                                 \n10 Countries for study tours will be identified during TA implementation. \n ", "  5\nproducts: (i) a policy note presenting the key findings and major policy recommendations of the \nTA, which will be shared with decision makers at the national and local levels; (ii) an external \npublication (i.e., an article) on Mongolia's education reforms; (iii) a conference report; and (iv) \nthe revised education sector master plan, which will be edited and then published.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $550,000 equivalent, of which $100,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV) and $400,000 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The Government of Mongolia will provide $50,000 through an in-kind \ncontribution. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  MECS will be the executing agency for the project. A steering committee (including \nsenior officials of MECS) will provide overall guidance. Consulting services consisting of five \ninternational consultants for 11 person-months and four national consultants for 17.5 person-\nmonths will be required. Consultants will have expertise in (i) higher education governance and \nmanagement,  (ii)  higher  education  financing,  (iii)  higher  education  assessment,  (iv)  quality \nassurance, and (v) knowledge development. The consultants will be responsible for producing \nthe TA\u2019s outputs and deliverables effectively and on time, and for organizing and carrying out all \nTA activities, including the conference and the study tours. ADB will recruit an international \nknowledge development specialist and a national quality assurance specialist individually. The \nremaining consultants will be engaged through a firm in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) and based on the quality of the \nproposal (80%) and the cost (20%) of the services to be provided (under the quality- and cost-\nbased  selection  method),  using  a  biodata  technical  proposal.  The  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. MECS will provide a suitably furnished office with utilities and \ntelecommunication access (broadband internet connection), materials, data, and documents as \nrequired under the TA; and will cover the cost of office utilities (electricity, heating) for the \nconsultants. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be recruited \nthrough advance contracting to expedite TA start-up. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction; and (ii) ADB providing the \nbalance not exceeding the equivalent of $100,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of \nMongolia for Reforming Higher Education for a Knowledge Society, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and   \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nImproved quality,  The government's STF will  Education management  The economy of Mongolia \nrelevance, and  provide better targeted grant  information system of  will grow on a sustainable \nmanagement of  and scholarship assistance to  MECS and universities   basis and mining projects \nhigher education in  disadvantaged groups by    will commence on schedule \nMongolia  2015.
