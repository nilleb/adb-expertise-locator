INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific (Key Indicators) is a flagship publication of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). This data dissemination vehicle has been refurbished \nseveral times in recent years. Since 2001, Key Indicators has featured a theme chapter on a \ntopic of current policy interest. To reach out to a wider audience, Key Indicators has been made \navailable on ADB\u2019s website and has been formally launched since 2001 with the support of ADB \nDepartment of External Relations (DER). In a major overhaul in 2008, Key Indicators began to \ninclude data on Australia, Japan, and New Zealand; new indicators for transport, governance, \nand other sectors; and statistical commentaries on thematic areas of socioeconomic statistics \nand the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Moreover, the Key Indicators team continues \nto strive to improve the content and quality of the publication. The technical assistance (TA) for \nthe preparation and publication of Key Indicators 2011 is an ADB corporate priority. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  A number of development challenges face Asia and the Pacific. Many people are no \nlonger poor, but the challenge of poverty reduction and inclusive growth still remains. The global \ncrisis showed how vulnerable the region is to external shocks. Key Indicators, with its accurate \nand updated data on ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) and its research on public \npolicy issues, helps measure and track progress in attaining inclusive growth and reducing \npoverty in Asia and the Pacific, and provides a statistical basis for evidence-based policy \nmaking.   \n \n3.  Key Indicators is ADB\u2019s preeminent statistical data book. For over 4 decades, policy \nmakers, investors, and researchers have relied on its economic, demographic, social, financial, \nand environmental statistics, updated yearly, on ADB member countries, including statistics on \nthe MDG indicators. Per DER statistics, Key Indicators 2010 was the most downloaded ADB \npublication between 20 August and 31 December 2010 after its launch on 19 August 2010.    \n \n4.  A special chapter, based on original research, examines a key policy or measurement \nissue, or a development challenge. \u201cThe Rise of Asia\u2019s Middle Class\u201d in Key Indicators 2010 \nlooked into the growth and impact of the rapidly expanding middle class, and the economic and \npolicy implications. For Key Indicators 2011, the creation of better employment in the region is \nthe chosen topic.2 The special chapter will broadly discuss employment policies that can reduce \npoverty and lead to more stable and inclusive growth in the region. Issues in the public and \nprivate sectors, including the role of labor market institutions, will be addressed. \n \n5.  Through rigorous econometric methods that use survey data and aggregate country data, \nas well as in-depth country studies, the special chapter will seek to identify major constraints on \nthe creation of better job opportunities in Asia. Background research papers on the topic will be \ncommissioned. Among other things, they will explore the impact of rural\u2013urban migration, better \njob opportunities in the rural and informal sectors, the role of manufacturing and services in \nimproving job opportunities in the urban areas, and policies and constraints in different countries. \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 February 2011. \n2  The choice was prompted by the strong interest shown by the public in the creation of specific types of employment \nopportunities that can contribute to economic growth and reduce poverty. While this topic has been covered in past \npublications, the economic changes over the last 5 years make it worthwhile to revisit the issues. \n ", "2 \nThe chapter will also use available data to link employment opportunities to education, including \ntechnical and vocational education. If production time permits, qualitative studies could be \ncommissioned. As equality of opportunities is a large part of better employment, the studies will \nscrutinize demographic differences in opportunities, including differences based on gender. With \nthis analysis and previous research, especially that done by ADB,3 Key Indicators will suggest \nways in which policies can improve job opportunities and speed up poverty reduction and the \nattainment of inclusive growth in the region. \n \n6.  For Key Indicators to promote ADB\u2019s credibility as a source of factual information about \nthe region and contribute effectively to better-informed policies and projects, the statistics and \nthe special chapter must continuously improve in content and quality. This will require rigorous \nresearch,  the  publication  of  carefully  verified  statistics  on  the  member  countries,  relevant \nbackground papers that will flesh out the special chapter, and wider and effective dissemination. \nAs it has done in the past, ERD will disseminate Key Indicators 2011 in partnership with DER.      \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  TA  will  support  rigorous,  evidence-based  research  and  the  production  of \nhigh-quality statistics on emerging issues that affect the socioeconomic development of the \nDMCs.  This  information  will  shape  policies,  investment  decisions,  and  project  formulation, \nresulting  in  better-informed  policies  and  projects.  Key  Indicators  2011  will  advance  ADB\u2019s \nreputation as an authoritative source of knowledge about the region. Appendix 2 outlines the \nplanned contents of Key Indicators 2011. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The main output of the TA for Key Indicators 2011 will consist of (i) the main book, \nincluding the MDG and regional tables pertaining to the DMCs and the special chapter; (ii) the \nspecial chapter, a stand-alone publication; (iii) highlights; (iv) online links to statistical tables and \nthe special chapter; and (v) background research papers. \n \n9.  The  TA  will  support  the  following  activities:  (i) reviewing  indicators  and  preparing \nquestionnaires; (ii) collecting data from the member countries and from international sources; \n(iii) validating the data; (iv) preparing country, regional, and MDG tables; (v) preparing statistical \ncommentaries; (vi) uploading the Key Indicators content on the web; (vii) updating data in the \nstatistical database system (SDBS); (viii) holding one or more consultative workshops for the \nspecial chapter; (ix) doing research and preparing background papers on various topics for the \nspecial chapter (see para. 5 above); (x) drafting the special chapter; (xi) reviewing and editing \nthe publication; (xii) preparing and laying out materials for publication; and (xiii) disseminating \nthe publication. The TA will also support the preliminary activities for Key Indicators 2012 such \nas background research and workshops on themes of current policy interest; data review, \nsearch, and preparation; and research on statistical practices and methods.  \n \n                                                \n3  Notably J. Felipe and R. Hasan, eds. 2006. Labor Markets in Asia: Issues and Perspectives (Key Indicators 2005). \nManila: ADB / London: Palgrave Macmillan Limited; and J. Felipe. 2009. Inclusive Growth, Full Employment, and \nStructural Change: Implications and Policies for Developing Asia. London: Anthem Press. \n ", "  3 \n10.  The  Key  Indicators  workshops  and  seminars  will  firm  up  the  initial  findings  in  the \nbackground research papers, identify constraints, and discuss the general directions of the \nspecial chapter. They will therefore be central to the development of the chapter. Distinguished \npanelists will be invited to the workshops.  \n \n11.  Accuracy, coherence, and a consistent approach throughout the publication, as well as \nconformity to ADB style and usage guidelines, will require high-quality editing services. National \nand international consultants working closely with the Key Indicators team in the Development \nIndicators  and  Policy  Research  Division  (ERDI)  will  serve  as  economic,  manuscript,  and \ncopyeditors. \n \n12.  The  dissemination  activities,  which  will  include  seminars  and  workshops  within  and \noutside ADB, will be carried out in collaboration with DER. These activities will widen the reach \nof Key Indicators and make the publication more readily useful and effective. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $800,000. The TA will be financed with a grant \nfrom ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 3.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency of the TA, which will be implemented by ERDI from \nFebruary 2011 to June 2012.  \n \n15.    The production of country tables and the MDG and regional tables in Key Indicators \n2011  will  require  6.0  person-months  of  international  and  54  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services. The international consultants will provide overall support and prepare the \nstatistical commentaries for the MDG and various themes for the regional tables, in close \ncoordination with the ERDI international staff in charge of the publication project. The national \nconsultants will assist in data collection from nearly 130 statistical agencies in 48 member \ncountries  and  from  various  international  data  sources;  check  the  data  for  completeness, \naccuracy, and consistency and validate the data, seek clarification from data sources; prepare \nthe country tables; prepare the regional and MDG tables; and upload the final data into the \nSDBS. The consultants will include those recruited for preliminary work, data research, and \nreview of the data series presented in the country, regional and MDG tables for Key Indicators \n2012. In addition to the foregoing, national consultants will provide manuscript editing and \ncopyediting  services  (1 person-month),  and  lay  out  the  text  and  statistical  tables \n(1 person-month).  \n \n16.  The special chapter will require international consulting services for the background \nreports and original research (7.5 person-months), for manuscript editing under the authors\u2019 \ndirection  (1.5  person-months),  and  for  background  research  on  likely  themes  for  the  Key \nIndicators 2012 special chapter (5 person-months). National consultants (20 person-months) will \nprovide specific insights, carry out research on a few selected countries, and assist in data \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \ncleaning, analytical research, and basic analysis related to the  theme of the chapter. The \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nbackground research for the Key Indicators 2012 special chapter will need the services of \nnational consultants as well (10 person-months). For Key Indicators 2011, resource persons \nwith knowledge of the theme of the special chapter may also be hired from ADB member \n ", "4 \ngovernments and local or international organizations to act as discussants during the  Key \nIndicators workshops.  \n \n17.  The terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4. Individual consultants will be \nhired, according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). Disbursements under the TA will conform to ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n18.  The major results of Key Indicators 2011 will be released to the media, policy makers, \nresearchers, member countries, and other data users. The publication will be featured on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. Updated data can be viewed and downloaded from the SDBS. Printed copies (with \naccompanying CD-ROMs) will be distributed worldwide. ERD will coordinate the dissemination \nin partnership with DER to capture broader and more useful client feedback. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n19.
