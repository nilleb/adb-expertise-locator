INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  generate  policy-relevant \nknowledge solutions that harness financial technology (fintech) innovations for stronger regional \ncooperation and integration in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) region. \nIn-depth understanding of fintech, which broadly describes the application of new technologies \nand data to financial services, especially in the context of regional cooperation among financial \nsystems, will facilitate the devising of policy mechanisms that sustain economic and financial \nstability and promote financial inclusion. The goal of the TA is to leverage growth and innovations \nof fintech products in the CAREC region, underscoring the need for a strategic collaboration \napproach among member countries and fostering collective actions within the region to allow \nseamless financial intermediation beyond the banking industry, while mitigating potential cross-\nborder risks associated with fintech innovations. \n \n2.  The TA aligns with the key operational priorities of fostering regional cooperation and \nintegration, and reducing poverty and the gender gap through digital financial inclusion as laid out \nin the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030.1 The TA aids the deepening of the finance \nsector as envisaged in the country partnership strategies of a number of CAREC member \ncountries.2 The TA also supports the CAREC 2030 strategy cluster on economic and financial \nstability, as well as the CAREC Digital Strategy 2030 under formulation, which promotes digital \nconnectivity among CAREC member countries.3 The TA is not included in any country operations \nbusiness plans because it is a regional program.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The CAREC region has made great strides in infrastructure and connectivity and the \npromotion of regional value chains. However, countries in the region should do more to integrate \nother areas, such as money and finance, trade and investment, and institutional frameworks, to \nbe on a par with other subregional initiatives in Asia.5 \n \n4.  Fintech has promising potential to effectively interlink economies and financial systems in \nthe region towards a common development goal. It offers innovative solutions that could mobilize \nfinance for efficient and inclusive intermediation, creating new forms of cross-border financial \nflows as well as introducing new instruments for capital market transactions across borders. By \naddressing information asymmetries through improved matching and pooling of savings and \ninvestments, fintech can change the nature of cross-border capital flows so that together they are \na more diversified and decentralized model of international finance.6   \n \n5.  The growing clamor for digital forms of payment, such as central bank digital currencies \nand \u201cstablecoins\u201d,7 lies in their potential to enable faster and cheaper cross-border transactions, \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

Fintech \nadoption and innovation could improve co-respondent (within and across countries) financial \nmarket  relationships by enabling greater transparency, increasing speed of execution, and \nimproving information tracking. In turn, fintech has great potential to help advance sustained \ndevelopment and financial inclusion after the coronavirus disease pandemic has passed.9 \n \n6.  The level of fintech development and sophistication, however, differs widely across the \nCAREC region\u2014the fintech architecture in the People\u2019s Republic of China is at an advanced \nstage while fintech activities in other member countries remain mostly payments-led, although \nmature credit solutions are emerging, especially in Kazakhstan.10 Consequently, the fintech \nmarket in CAREC (excluding the People\u2019s Republic of China) facilitated only around $325 million \nin transaction volume in 2018, much lower than the $2.2 billion in the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) and $1.9 billion transaction amount in East Asia.11 \n \n7.  The legal and regulatory environment and the capacity to develop relevant and modern \nregulatory frameworks and jurisdictions that are essential for expanding fintech solutions remain \nweak.12  Regional  and  global  dialogues  are  deemed  crucial  to  supporting  effective  data \nframeworks, especially considering the cross-border and global accessibility nature of platforms. \nAn effective regional cooperation mechanism is necessary to build functional and harmonized \nregulatory standards and surveillance systems for fintech to further prevent risks involving drug \ntrafficking,13 money laundering, terrorism financing, cybercrime, fraud, as well as breach of \nintellectual property rights and personal data and privacy.14 \n \n8.  While the majority of the CAREC member countries have rules and regulations for fintech \ndevelopment, mutual recognition agreements are needed to harness the potential of fintech \ntowards deeper regional financial cooperation.  The region also trails benchmark regions in \npromoting regional fintech hubs, which can offer a timely opportunity for regional collaboration \namong regulators and other fintech players alike. Other major challenges that are beyond the \nscope  of  the  TA  include  underdeveloped  information  and  communication  technology \ninfrastructure and low levels of digitization of financial systems.  \n   \n \n8  A.

The TA is aligned with the following impact: economic and financial cooperation and \nintegration in CAREC through fintech innovation and development enhanced (footnote 3). The TA \nwill have the following outcome: strategic collaboration among CAREC member countries towards \nbalancing risks and opportunities from fintech development improved. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Research reports and supporting knowledge products published and \ndisseminated.  In  a  first  report  (Fintech  Indicator  System),  the  TA  will  provide  in-depth \nunderstanding of progress made on fintech by CAREC member countries through an indicator \nsystem based on four major areas: finance, technology, capability (involving regulation and \necosystem), and regional cooperation. Legal issues, institutional arrangement and regulatory \nframeworks, digital adoption strategies including digitalizing trade finance, and potential risks in \nCAREC member countries will be examined. A second report (Fintech for Regional Cooperation: \nLessons from Other Regions) will discuss the kinds of fintech innovation benchmarks that regions \nhave been carrying out in the context of regional cooperation and how they can be effectively \napplied in CAREC-specific circumstances and challenges. The study will highlight fintech-related \nissues, such as cross-border payments and settlements, financial regulatory and supervisory \ndevelopment, as well as private sector development and regional integration and cooperation. \nLastly, a policy report (Fintech and Capital Markets Development and Integration in the CAREC \nRegion)  will  seek  to  identify  the  potential  role  fintech,  including  advances  in  real  asset \ndigitalization  and  tokenization,  plays  in  promoting  regional  cooperation  on  capital  market \ndevelopment and innovation. \n \n11.  Output 2: Roadmap for fintech-led regional financial cooperation in the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation region formulated. The TA will develop a concrete roadmap \nfor  accelerated  progress  of  fintech  in  the  CAREC  region emanating  from deeper  regional \neconomic and financial cooperation.  The roadmap will assess the  feasibility of a financial \ninnovation hub in the region to further develop expertise and drive innovation in the finance sector \nregionally. Knowledge products from output 1 will be instrumental in discussing practical areas \nwhere the CAREC region can implement a programmatic approach and related reforms. The \ndevelopment of the roadmap will involve collaboration and information sharing among experts \nfrom ADB, the CAREC Institute, and public and private partner institutions involved in fintech. The \nroadmap will include suggestions for deepening financial inclusion in the region through fintech \nto especially benefit local communities and female entrepreneurs and borrowers whose access \nto finance is severely constrained.    \n \n12.  Output 3: Fintech-backed Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation capital \nmarkets  forum  operationalized.  The  forum  will  be  a  venue  for  officials,  private  sector \nrepresentatives, and capital market operators from CAREC member countries to discuss and \ndebate measures to strengthen collaboration among their respective capital markets as well as \nhow fintech innovation can influence significant parts of securities transaction processes. Policy \ndiscussions and dialogue generated through the forum can be instrumental in moving the open \nbanking agenda within the region forward, as well as the coordinated ultimate introduction of \ndigital currencies by CAREC central banks. The CAREC secretariat will continue to support the \ncapital markets forum beyond the duration of the TA. \n \n ", "4 \n13.  Output 4: Knowledge sharing and policy dialogues on fintech development within \nthe  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  member  countries  promoted  and \nstrengthened. The TA will coordinate with the CAREC Institute on fintech-related research, \ndissemination,  and  capacity  building  initiatives  and  will  support  knowledge-sharing  among \nCAREC member countries. The private sector will be fully involved in the policy dialogues. A \nspecial  emphasis  will  be  placed  on  including  female  entrepreneurs  in  the  dialogues  and \nknowledge-sharing activities to ensure the emergence of inclusive recommendations for fintech \ndevelopment in the region. The planned physical and virtual region-wide conferences, seminars, \nwebinars, capacity building workshops, and exposure visits will improve the capacity of central \nbanks, capital markets, and finance ministries on fintech issues and support regional cooperation \nby bringing CAREC member countries together to exchange ideas and experiences on fintech-\nrelated matters. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($350,000 from TASF 7 and $400,000 from TASF-other \nsources15). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA. The Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination \nDivision (CWRC) of the Central and West Asia Department will implement the TA in coordination \nwith the CAREC Institute, relevant Central and West Asia Department sector divisions and \nresident missions, and other regional and knowledge departments. ADB will coordinate closely \nwith CAREC member countries in undertaking TA activities. CWRC will select, supervise, and \nevaluate the consultants and provide staff to act as resource persons at knowledge events and \nworkshops, and travel-related costs can be charged to the TA. The TA will be implemented over \n27 months from October 2021 to December 2023.   \n \n16.
