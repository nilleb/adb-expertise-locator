Improving people\u2019s health is one of the strategic priorities of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina  (PRC)  as  outlined  in  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  for  National  Economic  and  Social \nDevelopment  (2006\u20132010)  and  the  Rural  Health  Services  Construction  and  Development \nProgram (RHSCDP) endorsed by the State Council in March 2006. In December 2006, the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  the  assessment  of  the  initial  phase  of  RHSCDP \nimplementation.1 ADB undertook TA fact finding in February 2007 and reached agreements with \nthe Government regarding the TA impact, outcome, outputs, terms of reference for consulting \nservices, cost estimates, financing plan, and institutional and implementation arrangements.2 \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Before the economic reforms initiated in the late 1970s, the PRC was renowned for its \nimpressive  gains  in  public  health,  reflecting  a  commune-based  rural  health  system \ncharacterized by an equitable allocation of public resources and a focus on highly cost-effective \npreventive health services. However, following economic reforms and the dismantling of rural \ncollectives, and despite improvements in some areas, progress in rural health care and health \noutcomes has lagged behind the PRC\u2019s rapid economic growth and urbanization. In recent \nyears  the  Ministry  of  Health  (MOH)  and  other  Government  agencies  have  increasingly \nrecognized that there are problems regarding access to affordable health services.3 Rapid \nincreases in total expenditures on health care have outpaced public expenditure for health, \nwhich declined as a share of total health costs from 40% in 1980 to 17% in 2004. Low levels of \nhealth insurance have led to a sharp increase in out-of-pocket expenses for individuals, which \nreached 54% of total national health expenditures in 2004, compared with 20% in 1980. The \nshare of out-of-pocket health expenditures is even higher in poorer rural areas, where local \ngovernment health-care budgets are most strained and where health insurance coverage is very \nlow. \n \n3.  Since the 1980s the introduction of market reforms and the devolution of public finance \nhas had a serious impact on the quality of rural health services. County and township hospitals \nand village clinics face dwindling public budgets, and are managed like private enterprises \nattempting to maximize revenues. In some cases this is achieved through excessive sales of \nexpensive  drugs  and  supply-induced  demand.  The  rural  health  care  system  increasingly \nresembles a poorly regulated market. Total health care expenditures represented  5.6% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in 2004 and are projected to reach 7% by 2010.4 Limited mechanisms \nfor controlling costs and improving quality mean that this increase will not necessarily improve \nthe quality of care. \n \n                                                 \n1  Following the launch of an initial phase in 2004 in certain localities and endorsement by the State Council in March \n2006, the RHSCDP was formally announced in August 2006 to address key rural health problems. RHSCDP \ninvestments from the central level will end in 2009 and local implementation by 2010. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 15 February 2007. \n3  At the 2005 National Health Working Conference, Health Minister Gao Qiang cited accessibility and affordability as \nkey issues for the health sector. \n4  \u201cUnprecedented urbanization, rural reform and industrialization, and the rapid aging of the PRC's population will all \nadd to the demand for health care. Assuming continued growth of the PRC's economy at an average annual rate of \n7%\u20138% and continued growth of the PRC's total health expenditure at an average annual rate of 12%, total health \nspending will reach 7% of gross domestic product in 2010\u201d (United Nations Health Partners Group in China. 2005. \nA Health Situation Assessment of the PRC. Beijing). \n ", "2   \n4.  Public officials at the highest level have expressed concern about inadequate access to \naffordable and good quality health services and the need to narrow the gap between rural and \nurban areas in terms of access.5 Several major initiatives are underway that are expected to \nhave an important impact on the provision of rural health care services in line with the objectives \nof the 11th Five-Year Plan. Among these is the RHSCDP. Following the launch of an initial \nphase in 2004 in selected localities,6 and endorsement by the State Council in March 2006, the \nRHSCDP was formally announced in August 2006. It is the largest investment program in public \nhealth, and the broadest in scope, since the founding of the PRC in 1949,7 Investment from the \ncentral level will end in 2009 and local implementation will end in 2010.  \n \n5.  Assessment of past performance is critical to identifying key bottlenecks and obstacles, \nand  to  feeding  back  evaluation  results  into  evidence-based  policies.  Building  on  existing \nresearch,8 the TA will support an assessment of the RHSCDP initial phase so work plans can be \nadjusted and policies improved. The TA builds on previous ADB support to the PRC9 in the \nhealth sector, including research that helped to catalyze the Government\u2019s pilot-testing of the \nnew Rural Cooperative Medical System (RCMS), and follow-up work on expanding services \n(especially basic preventive services) and establishing mechanisms for community participation \nto enhance system management and guide implementation at the grassroots level. It also builds \non ADB cooperation with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in public \nnutrition and non-communicable diseases. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact of the TA will be improved access of rural communities to good quality local \nhealth services. The outcome of the TA will be a policy note issued by NDRC on improving \nequity, efficiency, and effectiveness of rural health services, which will form the basis for a \nreview and possible revision of the RHSCDP. \n \n                                                 \n5  The landmark Decision on Major Issues for Establishing a Socialist New Countryside, issued following the Sixth \nPlenary Session of the 16th Communist Party of China Central Committee in October 2006, calls for \u201cSolidifying \nthe public goods nature and quality of public health, deepening medical and health system reform, strengthening \ngovernment responsibilities, strictly supervising management, constructing a primary health care system to cover \nall urban and rural residents, and provide to the population safe, effective, convenient, and affordable public health \nand basic medical services\u201d. \n6  Localities were selected based in part on participation in the Rural Cooperative Medical System (RCMS) and other \nnational health-related programs. \n7  The RHSCDP includes measures to improve infrastructure and equipment of rural health facilities, management \nand operating systems of health facilities, human resources development and deployment, and related policy \nmeasures such as the new RCMS; medical aid for rural areas; aid for rural areas from cities; integration of rural \nhealth resources to optimize efficiency of resources; adjustment of health facility infrastructure, equipment, and \npersonnel to population base and actual utilization; establishment of a rural health network; development of \nmultiple systems of ownership; definition of service packages by level, rational pricing of services, and securing \nresources for rural health, especially for poorer communities. \n8  Includes the Report of the National Health Services Survey of 2003, the findings of the joint WHO\u2014Development \nResearch Center (DRC) project on health, a study on the Progress and Outcomes of the New Cooperative Medical \nScheme implemented by the MOH \u2014 Center for Health Statistics and Information, and the recent findings of the \nChina Rural Health Survey organized by DRC. \n9  ADB. 2000.

The  TA  will  have  three  components,  aimed  at  delivering  three  core \noutputs: (i) a tool for assessing the RHSCDP, (ii) an assessment of the implementation of the \ninitial  phase  of  the  RHSCDP,  and  (iii)  policy  recommendations  for  improved  Government \ninvestment decisions for rural health. \n \n8.  Component  1.  Assessment  Tool  Design  and  Pilot  Testing.  To  develop  an \nassessment  tool  for  the  RHSCDP,  the  TA  will  review  relevant  national  and  international \nexperience of evaluating health systems. The TA will define the objectives and scope of the \nassessment; identify information needs and users of the findings; and determine data collection \nmethods and instruments, quality control measures, data processing and analysis, and reporting \nmethod. The extent to which the RHSCDP addresses the specific needs of the rural poor and \nvulnerable  will  be  assessed.  The  TA  will  pilot-test  the  assessment  tool  and  prepare  an \nimplementation plan of the assessment to be carried out under component 2. The TA team will \nreport  to  the  Policy  Review  Group  (PRG,  see  para.  13)  on  the  results  of  the  review  of \nexperiences, the assessment tool and the pilot-test results, and the assessment implementation \nplan. \n \n9.  Component 2: Assessment of the RHSCDP Initial Phase (2004\u20132006). Following \nfinalization of the implementation plan in component 1, component 2 will support selection and \ntraining of interviewers and other persons who will be engaged to carry out the assessment, \nprepare  the  logistics  of  the  assessment  exercise,  and  implement  the  assessment.  Under \ncomponent 2, the data will be processed and analyzed, and the report of the assessment \nprepared.  \n \n10.  Component 3: Development of Final Policy Recommendations. Component 3 will \nprepare draft policy recommendations and proposals for further central and local government \ninvestments  in  rural  health  based  on  the  findings  of  the  assessment.  The  draft  policy \nrecommendations will be presented to the PRG and discussed during a workshop in association \nwith international partners. Under component 3, the policy recommendations will be finalized \nafter consensus has been reached and circulated by NDRC to the agencies concerned for their \nconsideration.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA will finance consulting services, including \nexternal resource persons for draft reviews and other focused inputs, office equipment and \nsupplies, workshops and training, field trips, and activities related to the implementation of the \nassessment  (e.g.,  the  survey,  focus  groups,  and  reviews).  The  Government\u2019s  contribution, \nestimated at $100,000 equivalent, will be in-kind through the provision of office accommodation \nand  venues  for  meetings,  counterpart  staff  and  allowances,  miscellaneous  administration \nexpenses, and local transportation for field visits. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 15 months from July 2007 to September \n2008,  with  core  policy  recommendations  to  be  identified  by  month  12.  NDRC  will  be  the \nExecuting  Agency  for  the  TA.  The  China  Health  Economics  Institute  (CHEI)  will  be  the \n ", "4   \nImplementing Agency. Under the supervision of NDRC, CHEI will be responsible for day-to-day \noversight of and support for the consultants\u2019 work, including coordinating the development of the \nassessment tool, implementing the assessment of the RHSCDP initial phase, and producing the \nassessment findings and policy recommendations by June 2008. \n \n13.  The PRG will be established to build broad support for the TA across key agencies and \nlocal administration. It will also disseminate major outputs to relevant ministries and agencies for \nconsideration. NDRC will chair PRG meetings and the Ministry of Finance will co-chair. NDRC \nwill invite MOH, State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ministry of Civil Affairs, \nMinistry of Education, Ministry of Personnel, Development and Reform Commission of the State \nCouncil, and other central and local partners to join the meetings. NDRC will be responsible for \nconvening (and CHEI for organizing) three inter-agency meetings of the PRG at (i) inception, \nabout 1 month after the start of the TA, to discuss the objectives, scope, and coordination of the \nwork of CHEI and the consultants; (ii) about 4 months after the start of the TA, to present the \nassessment  tool  and  discuss  its  implementation;  and  (iii)  about  12  months  into  the \nimplementation, to discuss the assessment findings and policy recommendations. \n \n14.  ADB will establish an advance payment facility for NDRC and/or CHEI to support agreed \ncash expenditures, including workshops and the implementation of the assessment in the field. \nCosted activity proposals will be submitted via NDRC to ADB for approval. The amount of \nadvance and eligible expenditures for advance payment will be arranged in line with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Disbursement of Technical Assistance Grants (1992). \n \n15.  In consultation with NDRC, ADB will engage a team of national consultants (20 person-\nmonths) and an international consultant (1.5 person-months), who will report to CHEI and ADB, \nand as requested to NDRC. Also in consultation with NDRC, ADB will recruit the consultants on \nan individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). The national consultants will include a specialist with expertise in \npolicy and evaluation, public health management, health services delivery, human resources \ndevelopment, rural health insurance, and pharmaceuticals. This specialist will act as the overall \nteam  leader  for  the  group  of  national  and  international  consultants.  The  other  national \nconsultants will have experience in health economics and financing, and health infrastructure \nand equipment. Short-term resource persons needed for the design and implementation of the \nassessment will be proposed to ADB and recruited under the team leader as required. The \ninternational consultant will (i) serve as advisor to CHEI and the national consultants; (ii) have \nbroad international expertise in evaluation systems, policy processes and health economics; \nand (iii) review the outputs submitted in English. \n \n16.  The  consultants  will  (i)  review  international  and  national  literature  and  practices  on \nevaluation and health system reform, (ii) contribute to the development of the evaluation tool for \nthe RHSCDP, (iii) organize and participate on-site in the assessment of the initial phase of the \nRHSCDP, (iv) produce the report of the findings of the assessment and help to formulate \nrecommendations for RHSCDP implementation until 2010 and for general health reforms to \nimprove access to affordable and good quality rural health services, (v) carry out field visits, (vi) \nprepare and organize workshops, (vii) liaise with government agencies as needed, and (viii) \ncollaborate closely with CHEI and NDRC. The Terms of Reference (Appendix 3) outline their \ntasks and reporting requirements. Consultants\u2019 reports will be prepared in Chinese and English. \n \n17.  The consultants, through CHEI, will submit to the Government (in Chinese) and ADB (in \nEnglish) four reports, which should include the conclusions of the PRG (except if decided \notherwise by ADB). The reports are as follows: \n ", "  5\n(i)  an inception report within 1 month of commencement of services for discussion \nduring TA launching, proposing a firm implementation plan, the description of the \ndivision of labor among consultants for the execution of the TA, a coordination \nmechanism with CHEI, and an indicative outline of the assessment tool;  \n(ii)  an interim report, to include the review of national and international experience \non evaluation systems, the proposed assessment tool, the result of the pilot \nexercise and the implementation plan;  \n(iii)  a draft final report to include (a) the review of international and national best \npractices in evaluation systems and lessons for the PRC; (b) the assessment tool, \nincluding methodology and implementation process; (c) the assessment report, \nwith findings and policy and operational recommendations; and (d) a separate \n10-page summary, targeting PRC key decision makers, of key findings on rural \nhealth,  lessons  in  assessing  the  RHSCDP,  and  recommendations  for  the \ngovernments to strengthen rural health systems; and   \n(iv)  a final report, which will include the finalized items (a)\u2013(d) above. An outline of \nthe final report is in Appendix 4. \n \n18.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has expressed a strong interest in participating in \nthe assessment process and policy dialogue on rural health within the framework of the TA. \nNDRC and ADB both recognize the value of technical inputs from WHO and welcome its \nparticipation. This will build on WHO\u2019s long-term involvement in the PRC\u2019s health sector, and \nongoing cooperation between ADB and WHO in the PRC and regionally. \n \n19.  In addition to systematic dialogue with CHEI and ADB throughout the TA implementation \nperiod, WHO will provide complementary technical inputs under the guidance of NDRC and \nCHEI. Specifically, WHO will (i) participate in the preparation of the workshops planned under \nthe TA, in coordination with CHEI and the consultants hired under the TA; (ii) provide input to \nthe review of international experience on health evaluation systems as proposed in the TA; and \n(iii) comment on the draft assessment tool and the policy recommendations. \n \nIV.
