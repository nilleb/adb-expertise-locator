In 1997, the Bank provided technical assistance (TA) 1 to the People's Republic of China\n(PRC) to assist the Government's efforts to (i) strengthen the formulation of water tariffs in the\ncontext of the management of the market economy, (ii) promote financial self-sufficiency of\nmunicipal water supply companies (WSCs) and water tariffs affordable to consumers, (iii)\nevaluate goals to be met in setting water tariffs and detailed tariff calculation methodologies,\nand (iv) prepare market-oriented national guidelines on water tariffs (NGVVT). The resulting\nNGWT were promulgated as a decree by the State Development Planning Commission and\nMinistry of Construction (MOC) in October 1998 and will become fully operational nationwide by\n2001. During the 1999 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its request\nfor a follow-on TA to develop the institutional and methodological capacity to implement the\nNG\\NT, set water tariffs, and establish a framework for full cost recovery by WSCs.2 A Bank\nFact-Finding Mission visited the PRC in June 1999 and reached an understanding with the\nGovernment on the objectives, scope, cost, financing plan, and implementation arrangements\nfor the TA. The TA will help (i) develop municipal-level operating guidelines consistent with the\nNGWT for the five case study cities, and (ii) prepare a broad-based capacity building program\nfor replication on a nationwide basis. The TA framework is in Appendix  1.\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Concurrent with the PRC's high economic growth, the country's urban population has\nbeen growing rapidly, increasing from about 190 million in 1980 to almost 400 million, or 30\npercent of the total population, in 1998. Between 1985 and 1997, the number of officially\ndesignated cities more than doubled to 668, 12 had more than 2 million people, and 34 more\nthan 1 million. The growing need for safe water supply and sanitation services (resulting from\nrapid urban growth and industrialization) is increasingly constraining the physical and financial\ncapacity of most cities. The Government has classified more than 300 cities as water-short\ncities, with 60-108 having serious water quality and critical water shortage problems. Because of\nthe seriousness of the situation, increasing attention is being paid to the preparation and\nimplementation of investment plans and sustainability of operations to address the water supply\nshortages.\n3. The Ministry of Water Resources manages the water intake permit system, coordinates\nwater resource utilization, formulates interregional and interprovincial water allocation, and\nprepares long-term water demand projections and supply plans. MOC, through the provincial\nand municipal construction commissions, is responsible for overseeing urban plans for cities,\nincluding plans and investments for urban water supply and wastewater treatment\n4. Most WSCs are experiencing difficulty in maintaining sustainable operations. The\neconomic reforms and resulting economic growth have affected WSCs in a number of ways.\nEconomic growth has been the most important determinant of the growing industrial and\ndomestic demand for urban water supply and the water shortages that many WSCs struggle\nwith. The economic reforms have also created a fiscal cnsis among WSCs, as pressure mounts\nfor all state-owned enterprises to achieve full cost recovery and end their reliance on state\nsubsidies.\n5. When the economy was centrally planned, the provision of water was heavily subsidized\nby the Government. Water tariffs in many cities remained unchanged for several decades. As a\nresult, the WSCs did not have sufficient financial resources to expand, or to operate and\nTA 2773-PRC: Water Supply Tariff Study, for $600,000, approved on 24 March 1997.\n2 \nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in May 1999", "2\nmaintain existing systems in a financially sound manner. Also, consumers had no market-\noriented incentives to conserve water. Beginning in the mid-1980s, the need for tariff\nadjustments was recognized because of rising costs and demand fueled by rapid economic\ngrowth. Historically, on a nationwide basis, prices have generally represented about 60 percent\nof the cost of water. A variety of charges such as construction fees have been used to recover\nother costs. In response to low profits and associated cash flow problems, WSCs rely on short-\nterm borrowing, debt refinancing, subsidies, and deferral of activities like maintenance. None of\nthese responses are sustainable. Central and local governments have supported low water\nrates by providing capital grants and concessional loans for project investment and direct\nbudgetary support for operations.\n6. Under the Government's ongoing market-based reforms, all new water supply projects\nare required to be financially sustainable and capable of full cost recovery. The WSCs are being\nencouraged to corporatize (restructure as corporations) and improve their cost recovery\ncapability and financial sustainability. Between 1986 and 1996, there were major increases in\nwater tariffs, averaging 17-21 percent nationwide. This reflects the Government's commitment\nto bring commercial principles to bear in the water sector. Despite these increases, water tariffs\nin the PRC are still relatively low, and could be increased further in many cities.3\n7. Low rate policies no longer serve the needs of WSCs because they are not able to\nsecure the grant financing that is required for major new investments in water infrastructure.\nPrivate sector participation in infrastructure development will be necessary in many cases but it\nwill not happen unless water tariff policies assure adequate recovery of all material and labor\ncosts, energy costs, and all fees for construction and other services including a reasonable\nreturn on equity. Quotas on water consumption have been imposed in some cities. The\ncombined system of tariffs, quotas, and fines is complex and costly to administer. Effective\ndemand management requires properly structured water tariffs combined with measures that\npromote water saving practices and technologies.\n8. Aggregate revenues for WSCs in 1996 were Y13.7 billion on sales of 22.6 billion cubic\nmeters of water. Overall, the industry experienced a modest profit of Y0.04 billion or 0.1 percent\non net assets. The 1996 survey by the China Water Supply Association revealed that 35\npercent of the 551 WSCs lost money in 1996. The study, which is considered to have somewhat\noverstated the positive performance of WSCs, found that while 359 of the 551 urban WSCs\nreported a profit, the companies that lost money offset the performance of the profitable\ncompanies. Existing financial problems reflect a combination of factors including cost escalation,\na failure to adequately increase tariffs, and accounting problems. 4 The average cost of urban\nwater production increased by 20 percent per annum during the past decade because of\nincreasingly poor raw water quality, higher production standards, and increases in the price of\ninputs. Financial records of the WSCs follow conventional accounting standards, but do not\nalways reflect the true cost of supplying water because capital costs financed by the\nGovernment are not recorded as water supply company costs. Despite significant tariff\nincreases over the past decade, many WSCs are still not recovering the costs that are reported\nin their books and are supported by government subsidies\nConventional parameters used by the Bank and the World Bank for measuring affordability in terms of income\nare 4-5 percent for water. On a nationwide basis, the average cost of water is 1 .2 percent of monthly household\nincome.\nFinancial records of WSCs follow enterprise accounting standards and use a standard system for cost\nclassification. But WSC accounts do not reflect the true cost of water supply since, historically, the capital costs\nof projects financed by the Government may not be reported in the WSC accounts. The new NGWT provides a\nclearer description of allowable WSC costs and further elaboration will be required as the NGWT is implemented.", "3\n9. Fiscal pressure is mounting for WSCs to achieve full cost recovery and end their reliance\non subsidies. Water tariff adjustments combined with cost control are the solutions to this\nproblem. This will require policies that promote full cost recovery. The primary requirements to\nachieve cost recovery are water tariff policies and methods that suit current conditions in the\nPRC. Water pricing is an important tool that can help the WSCs achieve sustainable levels of\nwater consumption. With reasonable water pricing and proper management, the WSCs will be\nable to meet current and future water demands. Reforms have created opportunities for WSCs\nto improve sustainability by entering into joint venture enterprises, creating profitable subsidiary\ncompanies, and seeking private sector partners to provide technical and financial assistance to\nundertake capital projects. Tariff reform will improve the ability of WSCs to take advantage of\nthese opportunities. Water tariffs would be increased in many medium and large cities. Urban\nincomes have been rising and inflation has been largely brought under control.\n10. The Government and MOC have demonstrated a strong commitment towards market\nbased water tariff reforms. A major step in this direction was the promulgation in October 1998\nof the first NGWT, which will contribute to increasing operational efficiency and steady progress\ntoward full cost recovery in the water supply sector. The inputs provided under TA 2773 were\ninstrumental in preparing and finalizing the NGWT. Major TA recommendations reflected in the\nNGWT include (i) selection of a tariff structure based on local conditions; (ii) a two-part tariff with\na volumetric and fixed demand charge; (iii) adoption of full cost recovery as the main objective\nin setting and approving tariff levels; and (iv) adoption of a simplified process for tariff regulation,\nrequiring evaluation and approval at the local level and supported by review and monitoring at\nthe provincial and State level. The NGWT is expected to improve the long-term financial viability\nof the WSCs, and provide for operations and management and service expansion, which in turn\nshould help increase private sector participation in the water sector. The NGWT provides the\nGovernment with a general, comprehensive, and systematic basis to formulate water tariffs in\nthe PRC.\n11. Additional follow-on advisory inputs are needed to help implement the NGWT and build\non the momentum resulting from the success of TA 2773. The proposed TA on water tariff\nimplementation is a logical next step in water tariff reform in the PRC. Additional support for\nNGWT implementation includes (I) assessing the NGWT impact on the existing water tariff\nadministration and regulation system, (ii) assisting the WSCs and selected local governments to\napply the NGWT, and (iii) assisting MOC to establish institutional mechanisms and procedures\nto effectively monitor compliance with NGWT regulations. The operational issues to be\naddressed include (I) setting up local-level water tariff regulations, (ii) establishing tariff-setting\nand approval procedures for WSCs to ensure full cost recovery, and (iii) developing tariff-\ncalculation models and practical implementation programs for local application. In preparing and\nformulating this TA, the Bank has relied substantially on the experience gained in past and\nongoing TAs on water supply tariff policies in the region, and the recent Bank loans for water\nsupply in the PRC.5\nTA 1998-VIE: National Water Tariff Policy Study, for $600,000, approved on 29 November 1993; TA 2501-INO:\nWater Tariff Structure and Financial Policies of Water Enterprises, for $600,000, approved on 22 December\n1995; Loan 1313-PRC: Dalian Water Supply Project, for $160 million, approved on 20 September 1994; Loan\n1636-PRC: Fuzhou Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment Project, for $102 million, approved on 30\nSeptember 1998; and Loan 1544-PRC: Zhejiang Shanxi Water Supply Project (Phase I), for $100 million,\napproved on 27 September 1997.", "4\nIII.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n12. The objective of the TA is to help the Government develop the institutional and\nmethodological capacities to (I) implement the NGVVT, (ii) set water tariffs and improve the\nfinancial capabilities of WSCs, (iii) encourage water efficiency, and (iv) promote an\nenvironmentally sustainable development of water supply.\nB.\t Scope\n13. Under TA 2773, a case study approach involving five cities6 was used to obtain detailed\ninformation on local institutional arrangements, WSC finances, water tariff structures and levels,\ntariff adjustment procedures, and water conservation activities. The new TA will include five\ncase study cities that will be used as test cases for implementing the NGWT.7 The TA activities\nwill be very focused and mainly confined to the five case study cities. Based on the work done in\nthe case study cities on capacity building, institutional strengthening, and implementing the\nNGWT, a program for broad-based capacity building for replication in other WSCs on a\nnationwide basis will be developed. The TA scope will include (I) strengthening the institutional\nand regulatory framework in the water supply sector (including developing a practical\nimplementing methodology) by establishing a model regulation for local water tariffs; (ii)\ndeveloping detailed tariff objectives including full cost recovery requirements, 8 affordability\nbased on income distribution, cost of living, and the value of noncash incomes; (iii) clearly\ndefining allowable costs to include only costs that are required to provide an efficiently operated\nwater supply service; (iv) developing a practical tool for tariff setting and calculation to achieve\nthe multifaceted objectives in the selected case study cities; (v) recommending measures to\nstrengthen the financial management of WSCs in the case study cities, including the reporting of\nall costs associated with water supply in the WSC financial records; (vi) improving the functional\ndetail in the WSC cost accounts to support the detailed tariff calculations and creating more\ninformative management accounting reports; (vii) assessing the pilot testing of the case study\ncities of the two-part tariff structure with a volumetric charge and a demand charge, and\nassessing its impact on tariff revenues and water conservation; (viii) assessing the capacity\nbuilding requirements related to implementing the NGWT and developing a consolidated\nworking paper that will include recommendations on local tariff guidelines, tariff setting and\ncalculation, and WSC cost recovery methodologies; (ix) assessing the impact of the simplified\ntariff approval process as stipulated in the NGWT; (x) assessing the impact of the NGWT on the\nurban poor; and (xi) outlining public information and consultation strategies to facilitate\ndissemination of tariff-related matters to the water users.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n14.\t The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,200,000 equivalent, comprising $624,000 in\nforeign exchange costs and $576,000 equivalent in local currency costs (Appendix 2). The Bank\nThe cities included Chengdu, Fuzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Zhangjiakou were selected from a candidate list\nof 14 cities on the basis of (i) population size, (ii) variety of types of consumers, (iii) location, (iv) ongoing or\nplanned Bank-supported water supply projects in the cities, (v) range of tariff levels, (vi) data availability, and (vii)\nwillingness to participate in the study.\nThe tentative list of cities include Chengdu, Fuzhou, Mudanjiang, Tianjin, and Wenzhou.\nFull cost recovery means the recovery of all financial costs associated with the provision of water including direct\nand indirect operating and maintenance costs, depreciation, taxes, interest on debt, and a reasonable return on\nequity. Subsequent versions of the NGWT are also to specify the maximum cost recovery target as being the full\neconomic price equal to the long run marginal cost.", "5\nwill finance $950,000 equivalent, on a grant basis, to cover the entire foreign exchange cost,\nand $326,000 equivalent of the local currency costs from the Bank funded TA program. The\nGovernment, through MOC, will finance the remaining local currency cost amounting to\n$250,000 equivalent, which covers the provision of counterpart staff, office facilities, local\ntransportation, background reports, studies, logistics, and a portion of the workshop budget.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n15. The TA will be implemented over a 19 month period beginning in November 1999 with\nexpected completion by June 2001. A firm will be engaged to provide a team of international\nand domestic consultants to provide a total of 72 person-months of consulting services\ncomprising 19 person-months of international and 53 person-months of domestic consulting\nservices. The consultants will be engaged by the Bank in accordance with the Bank's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The outline terms of reference for the TA consultants are\nin Appendix 3. The international consultants will include a tariff specialist, a financial and\neconomic analyst, an institutional and regulatory specialist, and an engineering and costing\nspecialist. The domestic consultants will include an institutional analyst, a legal expert, a\nfinancial and economic analyst, a financial management specialist, a socioeconomic analyst, a\ncapacity building specialist, a water supply engineer, a database specialist, and an\nenvironmental specialist. The TA equipment will be procured in accordance with the Bank's\nGuidelines for Procurements and transferred to MOO upon the completion of the TA.\n16. MOO will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will coordinate the liaison work\nrequired with State, provincial, and municipal government authorities concerned. MOO will\ndesignate a senior staff member as the coordinator of the TA and assign two full-time\ncounterpart staff to assist the consultants. MOO will form a steering committee to guide the\nimplementation of the TA. The members of the steering committee will comprise representatives\nfrom relevant government agencies, including State Development Planning Commission, and\nthe Ministry of Finance. The steering committee will be chaired by the Vice Minister, MOC, and\nwill appoint representatives from the case study cities and provinces to ensure that the views of\nthe local governments will be adequately taken into account and needed support will be\nprovided.\n17. In addition to staff participation, MOC will provide a suitably furnished office with utilities\nand telecommunication access, city transport for consultants, materials, maps, data, and\ndocuments required by the TA.\n18. The consultants will submit to the Bank (i) an inception report, within one month of\ncommencement of services; (ii) an interim report, at the end of the eight month; and (iii) a draft\nfinal report, at the end of the sixteenth month after commencement of services. The final report\nwill be submitted to the Bank within one month of the receipt of comments from the Government\nand the Bank.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n19.

Develop detailed\nrequirements for tariff adjustment proposals and make recommendations\nregarding application forms.\n(ii) Assess the impact of the NGWT on WSC cost recovery, water conservation,\naffordability of water, and fairness or equity in the system of paying for water.\nAssess opportunities and time schedules for implementing the NGWT.\nRegarding affordability, assess the impact of the NGWT on the urban poor,\nparticularly in light of the new tariff structure in the NGWT, which has a first block\ncharge that is set at a level that low income households can afford and includes\nwater to meet minimum household needs. In view of the economic distress\ncreated in some sectors by market reforms, affordability and related impacts on\nthe urban poor must be considered as tariffs are adjusted. Affordability should be\nevaluated in an objective manner based on factors such as income distribution,\nthe cost of living, the value of noncash incomes and absolute and relative\nmeasures of poverty. An objective analysis should be used to establish tariff\ndifferentials for affordability. The calculation of tariff differentials should be based\non an explicit guideline regarding an acceptable level of household expenditure\nfor domestic water supply. Tariff differentials that favor all domestic customers\nshould be reduced over time and efforts to achieve affordability should target\nonly households that truly need help Develop options that target poor\nhouseholds, (e.g., lifeline tariff structures and direct assistance programs).\nCollect appropriate, meaningful data and document under urban poverty in the\ncase study cities.\n(iii) Review and assess urban water demand requirements in the People's Republic\nof China (PRC) including water demands prepared by the WSCs.

In 1997, the Bank provided technical assistance (TA) 1 to the People's Republic of China\n(PRC) to assist the Government's efforts to (i) strengthen the formulation of water tariffs in the\ncontext of the management of the market economy, (ii) promote financial self-sufficiency of\nmunicipal water supply companies (WSCs) and water tariffs affordable to consumers, (iii)\nevaluate goals to be met in setting water tariffs and detailed tariff calculation methodologies,\nand (iv) prepare market-oriented national guidelines on water tariffs (NGVVT). The resulting\nNGWT were promulgated as a decree by the State Development Planning Commission and\nMinistry of Construction (MOC) in October 1998 and will become fully operational nationwide by\n2001. During the 1999 Country Programming Mission, the Government reconfirmed its request\nfor a follow-on TA to develop the institutional and methodological capacity to implement the\nNG\\NT, set water tariffs, and establish a framework for full cost recovery by WSCs.2 A Bank\nFact-Finding Mission visited the PRC in June 1999 and reached an understanding with the\nGovernment on the objectives, scope, cost, financing plan, and implementation arrangements\nfor the TA. The TA will help (i) develop municipal-level operating guidelines consistent with the\nNGWT for the five case study cities, and (ii) prepare a broad-based capacity building program\nfor replication on a nationwide basis. The TA framework is in Appendix  1.\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Concurrent with the PRC's high economic growth, the country's urban population has\nbeen growing rapidly, increasing from about 190 million in 1980 to almost 400 million, or 30\npercent of the total population, in 1998. Between 1985 and 1997, the number of officially\ndesignated cities more than doubled to 668, 12 had more than 2 million people, and 34 more\nthan 1 million. The growing need for safe water supply and sanitation services (resulting from\nrapid urban growth and industrialization) is increasingly constraining the physical and financial\ncapacity of most cities. The Government has classified more than 300 cities as water-short\ncities, with 60-108 having serious water quality and critical water shortage problems. Because of\nthe seriousness of the situation, increasing attention is being paid to the preparation and\nimplementation of investment plans and sustainability of operations to address the water supply\nshortages.\n3. The Ministry of Water Resources manages the water intake permit system, coordinates\nwater resource utilization, formulates interregional and interprovincial water allocation, and\nprepares long-term water demand projections and supply plans. MOC, through the provincial\nand municipal construction commissions, is responsible for overseeing urban plans for cities,\nincluding plans and investments for urban water supply and wastewater treatment\n4. Most WSCs are experiencing difficulty in maintaining sustainable operations. The\neconomic reforms and resulting economic growth have affected WSCs in a number of ways.\nEconomic growth has been the most important determinant of the growing industrial and\ndomestic demand for urban water supply and the water shortages that many WSCs struggle\nwith. The economic reforms have also created a fiscal cnsis among WSCs, as pressure mounts\nfor all state-owned enterprises to achieve full cost recovery and end their reliance on state\nsubsidies.\n5. When the economy was centrally planned, the provision of water was heavily subsidized\nby the Government. Water tariffs in many cities remained unchanged for several decades. As a\nresult, the WSCs did not have sufficient financial resources to expand, or to operate and\nTA 2773-PRC: Water Supply Tariff Study, for $600,000, approved on 24 March 1997.\n2 \nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in May 1999", "2\nmaintain existing systems in a financially sound manner. Also, consumers had no market-\noriented incentives to conserve water. Beginning in the mid-1980s, the need for tariff\nadjustments was recognized because of rising costs and demand fueled by rapid economic\ngrowth. Historically, on a nationwide basis, prices have generally represented about 60 percent\nof the cost of water. A variety of charges such as construction fees have been used to recover\nother costs. In response to low profits and associated cash flow problems, WSCs rely on short-\nterm borrowing, debt refinancing, subsidies, and deferral of activities like maintenance. None of\nthese responses are sustainable. Central and local governments have supported low water\nrates by providing capital grants and concessional loans for project investment and direct\nbudgetary support for operations.\n6. Under the Government's ongoing market-based reforms, all new water supply projects\nare required to be financially sustainable and capable of full cost recovery. The WSCs are being\nencouraged to corporatize (restructure as corporations) and improve their cost recovery\ncapability and financial sustainability. Between 1986 and 1996, there were major increases in\nwater tariffs, averaging 17-21 percent nationwide. This reflects the Government's commitment\nto bring commercial principles to bear in the water sector. Despite these increases, water tariffs\nin the PRC are still relatively low, and could be increased further in many cities.3\n7. Low rate policies no longer serve the needs of WSCs because they are not able to\nsecure the grant financing that is required for major new investments in water infrastructure.\nPrivate sector participation in infrastructure development will be necessary in many cases but it\nwill not happen unless water tariff policies assure adequate recovery of all material and labor\ncosts, energy costs, and all fees for construction and other services including a reasonable\nreturn on equity. Quotas on water consumption have been imposed in some cities. The\ncombined system of tariffs, quotas, and fines is complex and costly to administer. Effective\ndemand management requires properly structured water tariffs combined with measures that\npromote water saving practices and technologies.\n8. Aggregate revenues for WSCs in 1996 were Y13.7 billion on sales of 22.6 billion cubic\nmeters of water. Overall, the industry experienced a modest profit of Y0.04 billion or 0.1 percent\non net assets. The 1996 survey by the China Water Supply Association revealed that 35\npercent of the 551 WSCs lost money in 1996. The study, which is considered to have somewhat\noverstated the positive performance of WSCs, found that while 359 of the 551 urban WSCs\nreported a profit, the companies that lost money offset the performance of the profitable\ncompanies. Existing financial problems reflect a combination of factors including cost escalation,\na failure to adequately increase tariffs, and accounting problems. 4 The average cost of urban\nwater production increased by 20 percent per annum during the past decade because of\nincreasingly poor raw water quality, higher production standards, and increases in the price of\ninputs. Financial records of the WSCs follow conventional accounting standards, but do not\nalways reflect the true cost of supplying water because capital costs financed by the\nGovernment are not recorded as water supply company costs. Despite significant tariff\nincreases over the past decade, many WSCs are still not recovering the costs that are reported\nin their books and are supported by government subsidies\nConventional parameters used by the Bank and the World Bank for measuring affordability in terms of income\nare 4-5 percent for water. On a nationwide basis, the average cost of water is 1 .2 percent of monthly household\nincome.\nFinancial records of WSCs follow enterprise accounting standards and use a standard system for cost\nclassification. But WSC accounts do not reflect the true cost of water supply since, historically, the capital costs\nof projects financed by the Government may not be reported in the WSC accounts. The new NGWT provides a\nclearer description of allowable WSC costs and further elaboration will be required as the NGWT is implemented.", "3\n9. Fiscal pressure is mounting for WSCs to achieve full cost recovery and end their reliance\non subsidies. Water tariff adjustments combined with cost control are the solutions to this\nproblem. This will require policies that promote full cost recovery. The primary requirements to\nachieve cost recovery are water tariff policies and methods that suit current conditions in the\nPRC. Water pricing is an important tool that can help the WSCs achieve sustainable levels of\nwater consumption. With reasonable water pricing and proper management, the WSCs will be\nable to meet current and future water demands. Reforms have created opportunities for WSCs\nto improve sustainability by entering into joint venture enterprises, creating profitable subsidiary\ncompanies, and seeking private sector partners to provide technical and financial assistance to\nundertake capital projects. Tariff reform will improve the ability of WSCs to take advantage of\nthese opportunities. Water tariffs would be increased in many medium and large cities. Urban\nincomes have been rising and inflation has been largely brought under control.\n10. The Government and MOC have demonstrated a strong commitment towards market\nbased water tariff reforms. A major step in this direction was the promulgation in October 1998\nof the first NGWT, which will contribute to increasing operational efficiency and steady progress\ntoward full cost recovery in the water supply sector. The inputs provided under TA 2773 were\ninstrumental in preparing and finalizing the NGWT. Major TA recommendations reflected in the\nNGWT include (i) selection of a tariff structure based on local conditions; (ii) a two-part tariff with\na volumetric and fixed demand charge; (iii) adoption of full cost recovery as the main objective\nin setting and approving tariff levels; and (iv) adoption of a simplified process for tariff regulation,\nrequiring evaluation and approval at the local level and supported by review and monitoring at\nthe provincial and State level. The NGWT is expected to improve the long-term financial viability\nof the WSCs, and provide for operations and management and service expansion, which in turn\nshould help increase private sector participation in the water sector. The NGWT provides the\nGovernment with a general, comprehensive, and systematic basis to formulate water tariffs in\nthe PRC.\n11. Additional follow-on advisory inputs are needed to help implement the NGWT and build\non the momentum resulting from the success of TA 2773. The proposed TA on water tariff\nimplementation is a logical next step in water tariff reform in the PRC. Additional support for\nNGWT implementation includes (I) assessing the NGWT impact on the existing water tariff\nadministration and regulation system, (ii) assisting the WSCs and selected local governments to\napply the NGWT, and (iii) assisting MOC to establish institutional mechanisms and procedures\nto effectively monitor compliance with NGWT regulations. The operational issues to be\naddressed include (I) setting up local-level water tariff regulations, (ii) establishing tariff-setting\nand approval procedures for WSCs to ensure full cost recovery, and (iii) developing tariff-\ncalculation models and practical implementation programs for local application. In preparing and\nformulating this TA, the Bank has relied substantially on the experience gained in past and\nongoing TAs on water supply tariff policies in the region, and the recent Bank loans for water\nsupply in the PRC.5\nTA 1998-VIE: National Water Tariff Policy Study, for $600,000, approved on 29 November 1993; TA 2501-INO:\nWater Tariff Structure and Financial Policies of Water Enterprises, for $600,000, approved on 22 December\n1995; Loan 1313-PRC: Dalian Water Supply Project, for $160 million, approved on 20 September 1994; Loan\n1636-PRC: Fuzhou Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment Project, for $102 million, approved on 30\nSeptember 1998; and Loan 1544-PRC: Zhejiang Shanxi Water Supply Project (Phase I), for $100 million,\napproved on 27 September 1997.", "4\nIII.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n12. The objective of the TA is to help the Government develop the institutional and\nmethodological capacities to (I) implement the NGVVT, (ii) set water tariffs and improve the\nfinancial capabilities of WSCs, (iii) encourage water efficiency, and (iv) promote an\nenvironmentally sustainable development of water supply.\nB.\t Scope\n13. Under TA 2773, a case study approach involving five cities6 was used to obtain detailed\ninformation on local institutional arrangements, WSC finances, water tariff structures and levels,\ntariff adjustment procedures, and water conservation activities. The new TA will include five\ncase study cities that will be used as test cases for implementing the NGWT.7 The TA activities\nwill be very focused and mainly confined to the five case study cities. Based on the work done in\nthe case study cities on capacity building, institutional strengthening, and implementing the\nNGWT, a program for broad-based capacity building for replication in other WSCs on a\nnationwide basis will be developed. The TA scope will include (I) strengthening the institutional\nand regulatory framework in the water supply sector (including developing a practical\nimplementing methodology) by establishing a model regulation for local water tariffs; (ii)\ndeveloping detailed tariff objectives including full cost recovery requirements, 8 affordability\nbased on income distribution, cost of living, and the value of noncash incomes; (iii) clearly\ndefining allowable costs to include only costs that are required to provide an efficiently operated\nwater supply service; (iv) developing a practical tool for tariff setting and calculation to achieve\nthe multifaceted objectives in the selected case study cities; (v) recommending measures to\nstrengthen the financial management of WSCs in the case study cities, including the reporting of\nall costs associated with water supply in the WSC financial records; (vi) improving the functional\ndetail in the WSC cost accounts to support the detailed tariff calculations and creating more\ninformative management accounting reports; (vii) assessing the pilot testing of the case study\ncities of the two-part tariff structure with a volumetric charge and a demand charge, and\nassessing its impact on tariff revenues and water conservation; (viii) assessing the capacity\nbuilding requirements related to implementing the NGWT and developing a consolidated\nworking paper that will include recommendations on local tariff guidelines, tariff setting and\ncalculation, and WSC cost recovery methodologies; (ix) assessing the impact of the simplified\ntariff approval process as stipulated in the NGWT; (x) assessing the impact of the NGWT on the\nurban poor; and (xi) outlining public information and consultation strategies to facilitate\ndissemination of tariff-related matters to the water users.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n14.\t The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,200,000 equivalent, comprising $624,000 in\nforeign exchange costs and $576,000 equivalent in local currency costs (Appendix 2). The Bank\nThe cities included Chengdu, Fuzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Zhangjiakou were selected from a candidate list\nof 14 cities on the basis of (i) population size, (ii) variety of types of consumers, (iii) location, (iv) ongoing or\nplanned Bank-supported water supply projects in the cities, (v) range of tariff levels, (vi) data availability, and (vii)\nwillingness to participate in the study.\nThe tentative list of cities include Chengdu, Fuzhou, Mudanjiang, Tianjin, and Wenzhou.\nFull cost recovery means the recovery of all financial costs associated with the provision of water including direct\nand indirect operating and maintenance costs, depreciation, taxes, interest on debt, and a reasonable return on\nequity. Subsequent versions of the NGWT are also to specify the maximum cost recovery target as being the full\neconomic price equal to the long run marginal cost.", "5\nwill finance $950,000 equivalent, on a grant basis, to cover the entire foreign exchange cost,\nand $326,000 equivalent of the local currency costs from the Bank funded TA program. The\nGovernment, through MOC, will finance the remaining local currency cost amounting to\n$250,000 equivalent, which covers the provision of counterpart staff, office facilities, local\ntransportation, background reports, studies, logistics, and a portion of the workshop budget.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n15. The TA will be implemented over a 19 month period beginning in November 1999 with\nexpected completion by June 2001. A firm will be engaged to provide a team of international\nand domestic consultants to provide a total of 72 person-months of consulting services\ncomprising 19 person-months of international and 53 person-months of domestic consulting\nservices. The consultants will be engaged by the Bank in accordance with the Bank's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The outline terms of reference for the TA consultants are\nin Appendix 3. The international consultants will include a tariff specialist, a financial and\neconomic analyst, an institutional and regulatory specialist, and an engineering and costing\nspecialist. The domestic consultants will include an institutional analyst, a legal expert, a\nfinancial and economic analyst, a financial management specialist, a socioeconomic analyst, a\ncapacity building specialist, a water supply engineer, a database specialist, and an\nenvironmental specialist. The TA equipment will be procured in accordance with the Bank's\nGuidelines for Procurements and transferred to MOO upon the completion of the TA.\n16. MOO will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will coordinate the liaison work\nrequired with State, provincial, and municipal government authorities concerned. MOO will\ndesignate a senior staff member as the coordinator of the TA and assign two full-time\ncounterpart staff to assist the consultants. MOO will form a steering committee to guide the\nimplementation of the TA. The members of the steering committee will comprise representatives\nfrom relevant government agencies, including State Development Planning Commission, and\nthe Ministry of Finance. The steering committee will be chaired by the Vice Minister, MOC, and\nwill appoint representatives from the case study cities and provinces to ensure that the views of\nthe local governments will be adequately taken into account and needed support will be\nprovided.\n17. In addition to staff participation, MOC will provide a suitably furnished office with utilities\nand telecommunication access, city transport for consultants, materials, maps, data, and\ndocuments required by the TA.\n18. The consultants will submit to the Bank (i) an inception report, within one month of\ncommencement of services; (ii) an interim report, at the end of the eight month; and (iii) a draft\nfinal report, at the end of the sixteenth month after commencement of services.

In view of the economic distress\ncreated in some sectors by market reforms, affordability and related impacts on\nthe urban poor must be considered as tariffs are adjusted. Affordability should be\nevaluated in an objective manner based on factors such as income distribution,\nthe cost of living, the value of noncash incomes and absolute and relative\nmeasures of poverty. An objective analysis should be used to establish tariff\ndifferentials for affordability. The calculation of tariff differentials should be based\non an explicit guideline regarding an acceptable level of household expenditure\nfor domestic water supply. Tariff differentials that favor all domestic customers\nshould be reduced over time and efforts to achieve affordability should target\nonly households that truly need help Develop options that target poor\nhouseholds, (e.g., lifeline tariff structures and direct assistance programs).\nCollect appropriate, meaningful data and document under urban poverty in the\ncase study cities.\n(iii) Review and assess urban water demand requirements in the People's Republic\nof China (PRC) including water demands prepared by the WSCs.
