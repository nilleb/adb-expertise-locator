The Government of Viet Nam has requested a project preparatory technical assistance \n(PPTA)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  prepare  the  Support  for  Public\u2013Private \nDevelopment of the O Mon Thermal Power Complex Project. This proposed project has two \ncomponents: (i) the construction of the 750 megawatt (MW) O Mon IV thermal power plant by \nElectricity  of  Viet  Nam  (EVN)  using  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resource  financing  in  2007;  and \n(ii) constructing the 750 MW O Mon II thermal power plant by the private sector developer following \ntransparent and competitive tender process.1 The O Mon power complex is planned to have a total \ninstalled generating capacity of 2,800 MW and its construction is planned on the basis of phased \nconstruction of four separate power plants (600 MW O Mon I, 750 MW O Mon II, 750 MW O Mon III \nand 750 MW O Mon IV) at the power complex. O Mon I2 is currently under construction with \nassistance  from  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  while  EVN  will  commence \nconstruction of O Mon III in 2007. All four power plants will ultimately be operated as a combined \ncycle power plant. The O Mon power complex is located 300 kilometers south of Ho Chi Minh City. \n \n2.  The construction of O Mon IV together with O Mon I, II, and III will create demand for \nnatural gas to fuel the power plants at the O Mon power complex. This also provides strong \njustification  to  the  offshore  gas  developer  to  construct  the  gas  pipeline  to  supply  the  power \ncomplex. Once all four power plants are commissioned, the O Mon power complex will provide \nreliable base-load thermal power generation for the Mekong River Delta and reduce dependence \non hydropower imports from north and central Viet Nam. The ADB PPTA Fact-Finding Mission \nvisited  Viet  Nam  from  19  to  26  May  2006  and  had  discussions  with  various  ministries  and \nstakeholders on the proposed PPTA. The Mission reached an understanding with the Government \non the objectives, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the \nPPTA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Viet Nam is facing a growing deficit of electricity supply as a result of the strong economic \ngrowth it has experienced over the last decade. Gross domestic product has grown at an average \nof 7.5% per annum over the last 5 years and is envisaged to grow at about 8% per annum from \n2006  to  2010.  This  has  resulted  in  electricity  demand  growing  14.9%  during  the  2000\u20132005 \nperiod\u2013higher than the base-case scenario forecasted under the 5th Power Development Master \nPlan (PDMP). The draft 6th PDMP4 (2006\u20132020) projects electricity demand to grow at 16% per \nannum in 2006\u20132010, slowing to 11% per annum in 2011\u20132015 and 9% per annum during the \nremainder of the plan. In order to meet the growing demand for electricity, EVN and the Institute of \nEnergy have revised the power demand forecast and the schedule of several new power plants to \nhasten construction of power plants and transmission networks. EVN plans to add 15,000 MW of \nnew generating capacity to the power system from 2006 to 2010 in order to ensure the reliability \nand quality of electricity supply to rural, industrial, commercial, and residential consumers in Viet \nNam. \n4.  Given the envisaged rapid growth in electricity demand, the country's power system will \nexperience low reserves during the dry season,5 when hydropower plants can only operate at \n                                                 \n1  Included in the ADB, 2006.

Country and Strategy Program Update for the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam \n(2005\u20132006). Manila, as Second Power Generation Development.  \n2  O Mon I consists of two phases, phases I (300 MW) and II (300 MW) are scheduled for commissioning in 2008 and \n2009, respectively. O Mon II is scheduled for commissioning in 2011, O Mon III, in 2009 and O Mon IV in 2010.  \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 28 April 2006.  \n4  The PDMP is being updated and will be submitted to the Government for approval in September 2006. \n5  During 2006 to 2010, the average peak load will reach 13,700 MW, while the reserve margin (capacity) is only about \n3.6% of the total installed capacity. A 5\u201310% is desirable depending on the reliability of the power system. \n ", "2   \nabout 40\u201350% of their rated output.6 Hence, during the dry season, there are limited reserve \ncapacities in the system from 2006 to 2010. Over this period, the south, which has gas-powered \npower plants, can supply power to make up for only part of the deficit in northern and central Viet \nNam7 (but at a higher transmission cost). To make up for the shortfall in northern Viet Nam, it will \nbe  necessary  to  import  power  from  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic during the dry season. Viet Nam is already importing electricity from Yunnan \nprovince in the southern People\u2019s Republic of China and will begin importing power from the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic by 2011. By mid-2010, southern Viet Nam will start experiencing a \nshortfall of about 600 MW in generating capacity as power demand in the south is expected to \ngrow by 10% per annum. To meet this growth in electricity demand, O Mon III is being expedited \nby  EVN,  while  EVN  requires  O  Mon  IV  be  commissioned  by  2011  and  that  O  Mon  II  be \ncommissioned by 2012. \n5.  Hydropower plants currently account for about 39% of the total installed power generating \ncapacity.8 If the situation is left unchanged, it will soon be difficult for the country to meet its \ngrowing energy needs. This will lead to power deficits, especially during the dry season. The \nphased construction of the O Mon power complex\u2014in addition to several other thermal power plant \nprojects\u2014is one way to address the imbalance between hydro- and thermal power plants. As a \nresult of these projects, the share of installed hydropower capacity will decrease to 27% by 2020, \nwhile the total installed capacity of thermal power plants will increase from 5,400 MW in 2006 to \n15,000 MW by 2020\u2014making thermal generation a key source of base-load power generation.  \n6.  The estimated natural gas resources are more than 400 billion cubic meters (m3). Annual \ngas production in 2005 was about 6.5 billion m3 and is expected to reach 15 billion m3 by 2010. At \nthe moment, gas production is concentrated in Nam Con Son basin in the southeast coast of Viet \nNam. Almost all of the gas produced is used for power generation in the Ba Ria and Phu My \nthermal power plants. The current reserves of natural gas from the PM3-CAA, Cai Nuoc fields, and \nBlock 46 fields is sufficient only to fuel the Ca Mau I (750 MW) and II (750 MW) combine cycle \npower plants in southern Viet Nam's Mekong Delta, which are currently under construction. The Ca \nMau I plant is planned for commission in 2008, while the Ca Mau II plant is planned for commission \nin 2009. However, the proven reserves of natural gas from blocks B and 52 are sufficient to provide \nthe 4.6 billion m3 per annum of gas required over 20 years to fuel the 2,850 MW O Mon power \ncomplex.  \n7.  The challenge lies in maintaining sufficient investment in new generating capacity and \nexpanding transmission networks to meet the rapid growth in electricity demand. This is critical if \nViet Nam is to maintain the growth, competitiveness, and industrialization of its economy. The draft \n2006 6th PDMP9 estimates the total power sector investment requirement for 2006\u20132020 at $43.5 \nbillion, comprising $29.8 billion for generation and $13.7 billion for transmission and distribution.10 \n                                                 \n6  Most of the large hydropower plants are multipurpose power plants. During the wet season, the priority is to ensure \nflood control and during the dry season, the priority to ensure sufficient water flow for irrigation downstream as well as \nto prevent salt water intrusion.  \n7  During the dry season in this period, on an average, the north will have a power deficit of 1,127 MW, the central \nregions will have a power deficit of 106 MW, and the south will have a power surplus of 532 MW. During the wet \nseason, the north will still have a deficit of 550 MW, but this can be compensated by power transfers from central \n(which will have a surplus of 809 MW).  \n8  Currently (in 2006) the generation mix is: coal\u201313%, oil\u201316%, gas\u201330%, hydro\u201339%, renewables\u20131%, and imports\u2013\n1%; in 2010 the mix is projected to be: coal\u201325%, gas\u201335%, hydro\u201336%, renewables\u20131%, and imports\u20133%; in 2015, \nthe generation mix is projected to be coal\u201322%, gas\u201333%, hydro\u201336%, renewables\u20133%, and imports\u20136%; in 020 the \ngeneration mix is projected to be: coal\u201333%, gas\u201324%, hydro\u201327%, renewables\u20138%, and imports\u20138%. \n9  The Fifth Power Development Master Plan approved in 2002 foresaw 13.4% per annum growth in power demand \nduring 2001\u20132010 to support an economic growth rate of 7.5% per annum. However, power demand grew by 14.9% \nduring 2001\u20132004. EVN revised its development plans upwards in 2003, foreseeing shortfalls in capacity; even so, the \ncountry found itself seriously short of capacity in 2005, with large-scale load shedding required.  \n10  The World Bank is financing the 500-kilovolt transmission line backbone in southern Viet Nam and includes the 500-\nkilovolt double circuit transmission from the O Mon power complex.  \n ", "  3\nEVN generates enough cash internally to provide half of the funding requirements. Therefore, the \nfinancing gap will have to be filled by official development assistance, the private sector, and \ndomestic commercial banks. The operational and financial performance of EVN has improved \nconsistently over the last 5 years, with EVN maintaining its self-financing ratio and debt-service \ncoverage ratio without resorting to explicit fiscal subsidies. \n8.  Taking the above into consideration, ADB will focus its future power sector investments in \nViet Nam on generation. This was confirmed during discussions with the Government in the \ncontext of the 2006 country strategy program.11 The 160 MW Song Bung 4 Hydropower Project \nand the 1,000 MW Mong Duong 1 Thermal Power Project12 will be financed by ADB in 2006, while \nthe Song Bung 2 and 5 (260 MW) Hydropower Project and the 750 MW O Mon IV thermal power \nplant will be financed in 2007. \n9.  It is evident from the financial needs of the power sector that both private and public sector \ninvestments in the power sector are required to maintain the country's economic growth and \nprovide  the  enabling  infrastructure  for  private  investments  in  the  manufacturing  and  service \nindustries. In this context, the Government has adopted a strategy of (i) upgrading and expanding \nexisting  thermal  power  plants;  and  (ii)  developing  large,  2,000\u20134,000  MW  thermal  power \ncomplexes,  consisting  of  several  power  generating  units,  as  public\u2013private  partnerships.  It  is \nexpected that these power complexes and their associated infrastructure will be partially funded by \nthe public sector, with the private sector partially financing the power-generating units. This model \nwas successfully used in the development of the 4,000 MW Phu My Complex, where ADB\u2019s Private \nSector Operations Department has taken part in financing two private sector-funded power plants. \nThe Government also prefers to involve the private sector in natural gas power plants; however, it \nprefers the public sector to handle environmentally sensitive coal-fired power plants and large \nhydropower plants. Therefore, it is both justified and timely to support the Government\u2019s request for \nADB to support EVN's development of the 750 MW O Mon IV thermal power plant, and to support \nthe Government in competitively bidding the 750 MW O Mon II power plant for private sector \nparticipation. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The main impacts of the technical assistance (TA) will be (i) the development of the 750 \nMW O Mon IV thermal power plant by EVN for commissioning by 2010; (ii) the development of the \n750 MW O Mon II thermal power plant by a private sector investor under the build-operate-transfer \n(BOT) framework; (iii) supporting the Ministry of Industry (MOI) in the evaluation of technical and \nfinancial proposals received, and supporting MOI during the negotiation process with the selected \nprivate  developer;  and  (iv)  the  assessment  of  the  gas  resource  master  plan  prepared  by \nPetroVietnam and recommendations for gas pipeline interconnections with other power complexes \nin  south  Viet  Nam.  The  TA  will  comprise  two  components:  Component  I  will  support  the \ndevelopment of O Mon IV by EVN and, along with it, strengthen the performance of the overall O \nMon  power  complex  project  (i.e.,  the  technical,  contractual,  environmental,  and  social \nperformance). Component II will support MOI in undertaking the tender process for O Mon II as a \nbuild-operate-own or build-operate-own-transfer project by an independent power producer. \n11.  For component I, the key outcomes of the TA include (i) confirming that O Mon II, III, and IV \nare the least-cost power generation plants in the 6th PDMP, and their economic and financial \nviability; (ii) agreeing with EVN on technical specifications of the gas turbines that reflect the \n                                                 \n11   A power sector road map was prepared based on the draft 2006 Sixth PDMP. \n12  ADB. 2005.

For component II, the key outcomes of the TA include (i) developing a comprehensive \nrequest  for  proposal  (RFP)  package,  for  designing  transparent  bid  evaluation  criteria,  and \nevaluating bids received; (ii) preparing a set of draft project agreements, such as power purchase \nagreements, an implementation agreement, a gas supply agreement, and a land\u2013lease agreement \nto be used in the tendering of O Mon II on a BOT basis; (iii) training counterpart staff in the process \nof bid evaluations and negotiations; and (iv) establishing a transparent and competitive BOT bid \nframework for independent power producers.. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  A phased approach will be taken in developing, financing, and implementing the O Mon II \nand O Mon IV combined cycle power plants. Component I relates to the construction of O Mon IV. \nThe TA consultants will review the technical studies of O Mon IV and undertake an analysis of the \nproject  to  establish  that  it  is  the  least-cost  generation  option.  The  consultants  will  provide \nassistance as necessary to Power Engineering Consulting Company 3 in preparing the detailed \nengineering  designs  and  bidding  documents.  The  macroeconomic  linkages  of  power  sector \ndemand growth to overall economic growth will be analyzed to predict additional capacity needs \nand determine the potential contribution of these investments to overall economic growth. The \neconomic and financial viability of the proposed Project will be determined and a distribution \nanalysis will be carried out to identify the benefits and costs borne by different stakeholders. The \nfinancial  sustainability  of  the  sector  and  of  EVN  in  the  context  of  increasing  investment \nrequirements will be assessed, and appropriate recommendations made. \n \n14.  Component II\u2014supporting private sector participation in O Mon II\u2014will be undertaken in \nfour phases; phase I: TA consultants will review the technical feasibility study of O Mon II (prepared \nby Power Engineering Consulting Company 2), prepare the prequalification notice, and prepare the \nRFP documents, including assembling the draft project agreements; the consultants will assist MOI \nin prequalification of bidders; phase II: TA consultants will assist MOI in conducting the pre-bid \nmeeting;  during  this  phase,  TA  consultants  will  also  assist  MOI  with  answering  clarification \nquestions and bidder\u2019s comments on the draft project agreements; phase III: TA consultants will \nassist MOI with evaluating technical and financial bids; phase IV: TA consultants will support MOI \nduring  negotiations  with  the  evaluated  first-ranked  bidder.  All  public  bid  openings  will  be \nadministered by MOI with the help of the TA consultants. Once the results have been finalized and \nverified, the TA consultants will assist MOI with receiving final approval to issue the letter of intent. \n15.  An  assessment  of  the  gas  resource  master  plan  prepared  by  PetroVietnam  will  be \nundertaken and consultants will (i) assess the viability of developing a gas pipeline network in the \nsouth of the country to connect with the power plants; (ii) assess the quality of gas from the \ndifferent offshore fields; (iii) assess the technical implications of using gas with high CO  content, \n2\nand changes needed in the igniter systems and combustion chamber; (iv) predict the volume and \nanalyze  the  impact  of  CO   emissions  likely  to  result  from  using  this  gas,  suggest  possible \n2\nmeasures to reduce or capture the CO , and assess the economic viability of such measures; and \n2\n(v) discuss and recommend the optimal size of the gas pipeline to supply gas to the O Mon power \ncomplex, and analyze the possibility of extending the pipeline to supply the Ca Mau power complex \nand other industrial estates. \n ", "  5\n16.  To ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies for involuntary resettlement, \nindigenous and/or ethnic minorities, and gender, the TA will conduct a social analysis to identify the \nlikely social impacts of the proposed project. The consultants will also assess the resettlement \nimpacts likely to arise from construction of the gas pipeline, and will include these impacts and \nremedial measures into the resettlement plan. As required, detailed field surveys will be conducted \nto identify potential social impacts of the proposed construction site. All data and information \ncollected will be gender disaggregated. Suggested mitigation measures, institutional strengthening \nand capacity building requirements, and suitable implementation arrangements will be prepared. \nThe summary initial poverty and social analysis is provided in Appendix 2. \n17.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environment  Assessment \nGuidelines (2003), the consultants will conduct an environmental impact assessment (EIA), and \nprepare  a  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA),  including  an  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP). Public consultation will be carried out twice during the preparation of the \nEIA, including consultation on the draft EIA report. As this is a category A project, the SEIA report \nwill be disclosed 120 days prior to consideration by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. The EIA will also \ninclude an assessment of the gas pipeline construction both onshore and offshore, and the related \nimpacts on the social environment. In addition, the impacts associated with any new access roads, \nnew  resettlement  areas,  and  construction  camps  will  be  assessed.  Mitigation  measures  and \nenvironmental monitoring requirements will be incorporated into the EMP. The EMP will also \nrecommend institutional strengthening components and effective monitoring mechanisms. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.99 million. The Government has requested that \nADB provide $1.7 million to cover most of the TA cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe  Japan Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  Government  will  provide \ncounterpart staff, office space and facilities, technical feasibility studies, environmental reports, and \nsupport services. Detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are provided in Appendix 3. The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  For component I of the TA, the Executing Agency will be EVN and the Implementing \nAgency will be the Thermal Power Project Management Unit 3. For component II, the Executing \nAgency  will  be  MOI  and  the  Implementing  Agency  will  be  MOI's  Department  of  Energy  and \nPetroleum. The PPTA will require assistance of about 42 person\u2013months of international and 15 \nperson-months of national consulting services. Two international consulting firms will be separately \nrecruited for each component, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be  employed  in  recruiting  the  consultants \nthrough a simplified technical proposal. The international consulting firms will be responsible for \nengaging the national consultants and will be responsible to ADB for the entire scope of the PPTA. \nThe PPTA will be implemented over a period of 20 months commencing in November 2006 and \nending in June 2008. The equipment will be procured following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \nThe outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4, while the detailed terms of \nreference are in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n20.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $1.7 million on a grant basis to the Government of Viet Nam for \npreparing the Support for Public\u2013Private Development of the O Mon Thermal Power Complex \nProject. \n  \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact  Increased electricity  Government statistics;  Assumptions \nSatisfaction of Viet  demand met by  financial, industrial, and  \u2022  Ongoing government \nNam\u2019s power demand  efficiently performing  other reports containing  and private sector \nwith reliable electricity  facilities by 2011  the energy sector\u2019s  commitment and \nsupply at least cost,  performance data  resources to invest in \nImproved \ncontributing to  new power generation \nenvironmental and  Environmental and social \nenvironmentally  \u2022  Availability of gas and \nsocial performance of  performance monitoring of \nsustainable and socially  other fuel resources and \nthe energy sector by  the sector \ninclusive economic  feasibility of fuel supply \n2011 \ngrowth  Official reports and  interconnections \n  Benefits to local  feedback from the Ministry   \npopulation and  of Industry (MOI), \n \nindustrial sector  Electricity of Viet Nam \n \n(EVN), private sector \npartners, and power \npurchases \nAsian Development Bank \n(ADB) monitoring of \nbaseline indicators \nOutcome  Absence of blackouts  Consultants\u2019 working  Assumption \nRegional production in  and absence of need  papers and reports  \u2022  Government adopts TA \nthe southern Viet Nam  for power cuts  recommendations and \nADB missions and back to \nand in particular from  proposed procedures in \nReliable supply of  office reports  \nthe O Mon power  the implementation of O \nelectricity meeting \ncomplex is sufficient to  Official reports and  Mon II and IV power \nnational requirement \nmeet the growing  feedback from MOI, EVN   projects, and follows \n(e.g., existence of \nregional electricity  international competitive \nminimum acceptable  Public feedback including \ndemand by 2011  bidding processes and \ncapacity reserve  feedback from affected \nrules \nmargins, stable voltage  persons  \nRisks \nlevel) \n  \u2022  Inability to reach an \n \nagreements with gas \nAbsence of negative \nsupply partners, obtain \npublic opinion in \neconomic gas supply \nregards to project social \nagreements, and \nand environmental \naspects  develop supporting \ninfrastructure in a timely \nmanner \n\u2022  Inability to secure \nreliable power-purchase \nagreements for \nindependent power \nproducers  \n \nOutputs  Assumption \nViability  analysis  of  O  Technical assistance \n1.
