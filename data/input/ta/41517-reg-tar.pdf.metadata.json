The lack of well-developed local currency bond markets was one cause of the maturity \nand currency mismatches that affected borrowers in the region, and that resulted in the 1997 \nAsian financial crisis. At the time, overdependence on bank financing forced borrowers to take \non excessive short-term foreign exchange exposure to finance long-term projects that could \nonly  generate  local  currency  revenues.  This  created  two  \u201cmismatch\u201d  problems:  (i)  loan \nmaturities became too divergent, to the detriment of both local creditors and borrowers; and (ii) \nthe different currencies in which the loans were made became vulnerable to exchange rate \nvolatility. A lack of international confidence in one local currency caused a rapid depreciation \nagainst the US dollar. A payments crisis then ensued, exacerbating the loss in confidence \nacross the region through a \u201ccontagion\u201d effect, and leading to banking and currency crises in \nseveral countries. Recent improvements in global macroeconomic conditions and the structural \nreforms implemented throughout the region have allowed most crisis-affected economies to \nrecover and return to robust growth. However, despite recent growth, bond markets in the \nregion remain largely undeveloped. \n \n2.  With this in mind, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations+3 (ASEAN+3)1 finance \nministers  established  the  Asian  Bond  Markets  Initiative  (ABMI)  in  August  2003  to  boost \ndevelopment of local currency bond markets to help mitigate the double mismatch problem, and \nre-channel Asian savings within the region. Currently, the focus of the ABMI2 is on (i) expanding \nthe number and diversifying the makeup of issuers on local currency bond markets, and (ii) \ndeveloping an environment conducive and attractive to domestic and regional bond market \nparticipants. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported ABMI since its inception, \nparticularly through the provision of technical assistance (TA). The ABMI also complements \nwork done by other regional forums on bond market development, including the Executives\u2019 \nMeeting  of  the  East  Asia-Pacific  Central  Banks  (EMEAP)  and  Asia-Pacific  Economic \nCooperation (APEC).3 \n \n3.  In  2005,  ADB,  at  the  request  of  the  ABMI  working  group  on  foreign  exchange \ntransactions  and  settlement  issues  (WG3),  provided  assistance  through  the  TA  project \nASEAN+3 Regional Settlement Linkage.4 In line with several recommendations of the study, \nADB  was  asked  by  WG3  to  undertake  a  further  study  on  risk  reduction  in  clearing  and \nsettlement, particularly on foreign exchange settlement risk5for cross-border bond transactions. \n \n                                                 \n1  ASEAN+3 includes the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, \nIndonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet \nNam) plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and Republic of Korea. \n2  The ABMI originally comprised six working groups but was reorganized in May 2008 and now comprises four task \nforces\u2014task force 1: promoting issuance of local currency denominated bonds (cochaired by Thailand and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China); task force 2: facilitating demand of local currency denominated bonds (cochaired by \nSingapore and Japan); task force 3: improving regulatory framework (cochaired by Malaysia and Japan); and task \nforce 4: improving related infrastructure for the bond markets (Republic of Korea and the Philippines). The task \nforces will be complemented by the TA coordination team (cochaired by Brunei, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nand Viet Nam). The overall work of the task force will be supervised by the steering committee, an apex body that \noversees overall ABMI progress.  \n3  EMEAP initiatives include enhancing the demand side for bond market development through Asian bond funds 1 \nand  2.  APEC  initiatives  included  the  initiative  on  development  of  securitization  and  credit  guarantee,  and \nharmonization of bond market rules and regulations. \n4   ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for ASEAN+3 Regional Settlement Linkage. Manila (TA 6161-REG, approved on \n19 December). \n5  Foreign exchange settlement risk refers to risk exposure to cash payments and delivery of bonds arising during \nbond settlements on cross-border transactions. \n ", "2   \nThe report\u2014Minimizing Foreign Exchange Settlement Risk in the ASEAN+3 Region,6\u2014was \ncompleted  and  reported  to  the  WG3  meeting  in  November  2007.  At  that  meeting,  WG3 \nmembers agreed that a group of experts (GOE) be established under the ambit of the ABMI to \ndiscuss several key issues outlined in the report, including issues related to cross-border bond \ntransactions and settlement, as well as the feasibility of establishing a regional settlement \nintermediary (RSI). The objective is to improve the current arrangements and framework for \ncross-border bond transactions and settlement. The managing director general approved the TA \nconcept clearance on 28 April 2006, under ADB\u2019s 3-year knowledge products and service work \nplan 2007\u20132009.7 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  A securities settlement system can be broadly defined to include the set of institutional \narrangements  for  confirming,  clearing,  and  settling  securities  trades  and  safekeeping  of \nsecurities. The development of a well-functioning settlement system\u2014in which settlement of \ncross-border bond transactions is executed and completed in a timely, definitive and cost-\nefficient manner\u2014can contribute to more efficient bond markets. Such a settlement system can \nalso minimize settlement risk and bring about greater financial stability. Securities settlement \nsystems are therefore a critical component of bond market infrastructure. \n \n5.  The rapid growth of the ASEAN+3 bond market in recent years has also brought about \nan  urgent  need  for  more  efficient  clearing  and  settlement  systems  for  cross-border  bond \ntransactions. Bond markets have become an increasingly important channel for intermediating \nfund  flows  among  borrowers,  lenders,  and  investors,  because  of  their  increasingly  active \nmanagement of their securities portfolios. There is therefore a need to improve the region\u2019s \nfinancial infrastructure to meet the needs of the growing bond markets.  \n \n6.  Currently,  settlement  of  cross-border  bond  transactions  in  ASEAN+3  is  relatively \ninefficient. Most settlement intermediaries operate from time zones different from the Asian \nmarkets, which can lead to settlement risks, including liquidity and Herstatt risks.8 In addition, \nnot all ASEAN+3 currencies can be settled through the Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) \nBank,9  forcing  them  to  utilize  a  correspondent  (third-party)  CLS  settlement-member  bank, \nthereby increasing risks and costs. For cross-border bond settlement in Asia (particularly for \nnon-eligible CLS currencies), true delivery-versus-payment (DVP) and payment-versus-payment \n(PVP) is therefore seldom possible, resulting in higher costs for cross-border transactions and \ncontributing to financial market instability. \n \n7.  To  address  these  important  issues,  the  report  under  the  TA  Minimizing  Foreign \nExchange Settlement Risk in the ASEAN+3 Region suggested the establishment of an RSI that \nwill provide both DVP and PVP functions. Three options10 for an RSI were identified: (i) an \nAsian international central securities depository, (ii) a pan-Asian central securities depository \n(CSD), and (iii) an Asian payments bank. It recommended that study of the feasibility of these \n                                                 \n6  The report highlighted foreign exchange risk as one of the most important types of risk. (ADB. 2006. Technical \nAssistance for Minimizing Foreign Exchange Settlement Risk in the ASEAN+3 Region. Manila [TA 6338-REG, \napproved on 25 August]). \n7  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 July 2008. \n8  Herstatt risk is the risk that one party to a foreign exchange transaction takes when it pays the currency it sold, but \ndoes not simultaneously receive the currency it bought. \n9  There are currently only four Asian currencies (Hong Kong dollar, Singapore dollar, won, and yen) that are eligible \nfor CLS Bank settlement. \n10 Bank for International Settlements, Clearstream, and Euroclear are institutions that can elaborate on the three \npossible RSI options. ", "  3\noptions be taken forward by market experts. As a result, ASEAN+3 endorsed the establishment \nof the GOE, which will comprise market participants such as custodians and national CSDs with \nexpertise in cross-border bond transactions and settlement, to be nominated by each of the \nTF411 member countries, as well as global players, such as international CSDs and global and \nregional custodian institutions.  \n \n8.  The approaches taken by the European market to promote greater market integration \ncould provide valuable lessons for the ASEAN+3 region regarding harmonizing and coordinating \nthe diverse interests of member countries and financial institutions. For example, the Giovannini \nGroup,  established  in  1996,  comprises  a  group  of  financial  market  participants\u2014including \nrepresentatives  from  the  European  Commission,  banks,  brokers,  exchanges,  central \ncounterparties,  and  CSDs\u2014that  advises  the  European  Commission  in  making  decisions \nregarding the financial market. It specializes in identifying inefficiencies in the European Union \nfinancial markets and proposing practical solutions to enhance cross-border transactions. One \nof the Giovannini Group\u2019s most important contributions is its report on barriers to cross-border \nclearing and settlements in the European Union and the strategies for their removal.12  \n \n9.  The  Giovannini  Group  experience  suggests  that  a  similar  group  of  experts  can  be \nestablished in Asia to provide advice to governments on cross-border clearing and settlement \nissues as part of the region\u2019s bond market development. The issues are complex, with various \napproaches  and  dependence  on  differing  institutional  arrangements,  necessitating  the \npromotion  of  cooperative  efforts  among  the  banking  sector,  regulators,  and  other  relevant \nstakeholders. The GOE will conduct a cost\u2013benefit analysis of establishing an RSI for cross-\nborder bond transactions, and identify problems and propose recommendations on settlement-\nrelated issues. \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  TA  aims  to  assist  bond  market  development  and  to  promote  cross-border \ninvestment in domestic bonds in ASEAN+3. It will facilitate growth of and reduce settlement risk \nin cross-border bond transactions in ASEAN+3 region by supporting GOE activities. The GOE \nwill study key issues related to cross-border bond transactions and settlement, including the \nfeasibility of setting up an RSI to minimize settlement risk13 in cross-border bond transactions. \nThe expected outcome would be for ASEAN+3 officials to make informed decision based on \ndiscussions related to feasible mechanisms for the settlement of cross-border bond transactions. \nThis  will  lead  to  an  increase  in  cross-border  bond  transactions,  making  investing  in  local \ncurrency Asian bond markets more attractive. The TA will cover most ASEAN+3 countries, \nfocusing on People\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet \nNam.  \n  \n11.  The TA supports the regional cooperation and integration strategy of ADB\u2019s Office of \nRegional Economic Integration to foster development of bond markets, build financial resilience, \npromote stability, and facilitate financial integration among countries in the region. \n \n                                                 \n11 WG3 was reorganized in May 2008 and renamed task force 4 on improving related infrastructure for the bond \nmarkets (TF4). See also footnote 2. \n12 The report on cross-border clearing and settlement arrangements in the European Union may be found at \nhttp://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/publication1950_en.pdf. \n13 The scope of risks should be limited to those risks mentioned in the Giovannini report. \n ", "4   \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  Key factors in the study\u2019s success will be (i) the commitment of the GOE; (ii) the depth of \nresearch, including consultations with market participants; (iii) the quality of discussions at GOE \nmeetings; and (iv) the feasibility of the recommendations, driven to a large extent by the views \nand other inputs of the GOE. ADB will support GOE activities by conducting research (with \nsupport from TA consultants) into specific technical areas requested by the GOE, and by \nproviding secretariat and administrative functions for the smooth running of GOE meetings \nincluding information dissemination among members, through the use of websites such as \nasianbondsonline.adb.org,  or  through  the  creation  of  a  specific  GOE  website,  and  media \nrelations. However, ADB will not cover travel and accommodation costs for GOE members.  \n \n13.  The research work of the GOE will proceed in two main strands: (i) evaluation of an RSI; \nand (ii) removal of settlement-related barriers to cross-border bond investment, including a \nreview of laws and regulation for settlement and clearing. The content of each strand is further \nspecified below. \n \n14.  Evaluation of an RSI. The GOE will select one or more RSI options for study from the \nlist  in  the  report  under  the  TA  for  Minimizing  Foreign  Exchange  Settlement  Risk  in  the \nASEAN+3 Region, and possibly others that may be suggested by TF4 or the GOE. It will \ninvestigate the details of the selected options, such as services offered, operations, ownership \nand governance, and likely participants. It will determine the legal, regulatory, operational, and \nother impediments to establishing and operating such an RSI, and review and assess the pros \nand cons. As far as possible, the GOE will quantify the benefits and costs of the selected RSI \noptions, and will determine the likely investment and actions needed and a realistic timescale for \nits establishment. In the light of the foregoing, the GOE will assess the business case for the \nselected RSI options, and advise TF4 as to their overall feasibility.  \n \n15.  The evaluation of the RSI should, in particular, take account of the extent to which it \nprovides DVP and PVP in securities and cash settlements, and the associated benefits to \nmarket participants. The focus will be on improving cross-border settlement for the ASEAN+3 \nbond markets. Where appropriate, in its evaluation of feasibility, the GOE will take into account \nbenefits to the equity markets and foreign exchange markets as well. The GOE will also be \ninvited  to  discuss  other  ideas  for  an  RSI,  such  as  provision  of  a  cross-border  central \ncounterparty service and cross-border collateral management. \n \n16.  Identification of Settlement-Related Barriers to Cross-Border Bond Investment. \nThe GOE will identify the main settlement-related barriers in ASEAN+3, including withholding \ntax and reporting issues, and document the extent to which these barriers exist in each country. \nThese should include, but need not be restricted to, the barriers mentioned in the final report on \nminimizing foreign exchange settlement risk (para.14). It will assess actual inhibition of cross-\nborder bond investment by such barriers, and propose a road map for their elimination. \n \n17.  The GOE will also review laws and regulations relating to the finality of payments and \nsecurities settlements in each country, as relevant to cross-border bond transactions. \n \n18.  The study will also include a review of system capabilities and readiness of infrastructure \nand the supporting institutional arrangements in individual member countries for ASEAN+3 \nlinkages or establishment of an RSI. \n ", "  5\n19.  The study will propose nonbinding recommendations to the GOE, and provide TF4 with \nan appropriate road map for policymakers to remove identified impediments.  \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $850,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Investment  Climate  Facilitation  Fund14  under  the  Regional  Cooperation  and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB. Detailed cost estimates \nand a financing plan are in Appendix 2. Participating ASEAN+3 member countries will finance \nthe costs of individual TF4 activities; GOE members will finance their respective costs relating to \nGOE activities. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  Initial  consultations  with  the  ASEAN+3  governments  were  conducted  within  the \nframework of ABMI Task Force 4, and the TA has been endorsed by them. ADB will be the \nexecuting agency for the TA, which will be administered and implemented by ADB\u2019s Office of \nRegional Economic Integration, in close consultation with the ABMI TF4 member countries, \nparticularly the Republic of Korea and the Philippines (the TF4 cochairs). ADB will supervise the \nwork of the TA consultants.  \n \n22.  Five international consultants and one national consultant will be engaged for a total of \n22  person-months  of  international  consultancy  services  and  12  person-months  of  national \nconsultancy  services.  The  consultants  will  be  hired  and  engaged  by  ADB  as  individual \nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  An  individual  consultancy  arrangement  is  suggested,  as  the  proposed \nexperts will be assigned to different offices and/or locations to undertake research or serve their \nown counterpart(s), and will prepare individual reports and recommendations. The outline terms \nof reference for the consultants is in Appendix 3. \n \n23.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  a  period  of  approximately  12  months  beginning  in \nDecember 2008. A series of GOE meetings will be held over the period to study and discuss the \nissues. The GOE will report regularly to TF4. Consultations with other market participants will be \nheld as required. With these inputs, as well as those from government officials, a series of draft \ninterim reports will be submitted to TF4 starting in February 2009. A final presentation to TF4 is \nexpected in October 2009. The suggested outline of the final report is in Appendix 4. Upon \ncompletion, the report will be disseminated within ADB and on appropriate websites,15 with \n \nexternal publication of the report subject to approval by TF4 members. In addition, a conference \nwill be held to disseminate and share the findings of the GOE interim and final reports with the \nrest of the capital market community.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $850,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility for Minimizing Foreign Exchange Settlement Risk in \nthe ASEAN+3 Region: Support for Group of Experts, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n14  Established by the Government of Japan. \n15  For example, http://asianbondsonline.adb.org. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources  Assumptions  \nSummary  and/or Indicators  and/or  and Risks   \nReporting \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nFacilitate growth of and  Increased issuance of local  Bond market data  Commitment and \nreduced settlement risk in  currency bonds, from $3.7  from Asian bonds  cooperation of ASEAN+3 \ncross-border bond  trillion in 2007 to a minimum  online website  governments and the \ntransactions in ASEAN+3  of $7.4 trillion in 5 years    GOE to address key \nregion       issues related to cross-\n  Increase in foreign currency  Asia Bond Monitor  border bond transactions \n  bonds from ASEAN+3 region    and settlement issues \ncountries as a share of total     \nbonds outstanding in    Capital market conditions \nASEAN+3 countries, from    remain stable in both the  \n2.8% to a minimum of 5.6% in  ASEAN+3 region and the \n5 years  global market \nOutcome      Assumptions \nASEAN+3 officials to make  At least three ASEAN+3  Market  Relative stability of \ninformed decision based on  member countries consider  consultations with  financial and capital \ndiscussions related to  adopting the policy  ASEAN+3 member  market sectors \nfeasible mechanisms for  recommendations by 2009  countries    \nthe settlement of cross- Continued growth in \nborder bond transactions  cross-border bond \ntransactions \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Standardization  and  harmonization  of  regulations  and  trade  practices  in  the \nregion.

Institutionalization of private\u2013public sector dialogue in the region. The GOE was \nthe first region-wide collective action to express their opinion to the governments \nunder the framework of ASEAN+3.
