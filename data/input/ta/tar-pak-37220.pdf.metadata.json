In 2002, the Government of Pakistan requested technical assistance (TA) to prepare a \nproject to provide basic urban services to poor communities in the Province of Sindh. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Country Strategy and Program Update for the Islamic Republic of \nPakistan includes the provision for such TA, proposed for ADB financing in 2004. The ADB \nFact-Finding Mission visited Pakistan during 11\u201319 October 2004, formulated the TA in line with \nthe program of actions formalized in the poverty reduction partnership agreement between the \nGovernment and ADB, and reached preliminary understanding with the Government on the \ngoals, purpose, scope, implementation and financing arrangements, cost and terms of reference \nof the TA.1 A preliminary project framework for the ensuing Project is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Pakistan  ranks  142nd  out  of  175  countries  on  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme human development index (2004). The annual population growth rate of Sindh2 \n(1981\u201398) was 2.8% against the national average of 2.1%. As in most of Pakistan, Sindh\u2019s most \npressing needs over the next quarter century include managing a rapidly increasing population, \nand the provision of basic amenities: food, domestic water supply,3 waste management, and \npower.4 Half of Sindh\u2019s population lives in urban areas, where one third of the population is \npoor,5 living on less than a dollar a day. The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n3.  Urban areas in Sindh are growing rapidly, at a rate of about 3.5% or over 1.4 million per \nannum. Although efforts to stimulate rural development can reduce the rate of in-migration to \nurban areas, 65\u201375% of Pakistan\u2019s urban growth rate is due to natural population increase. \nUrban growth is likely to continue regardless of actions taken in rural areas. Thus, failure to \ninvest in urban areas will result in deteriorating living conditions, particularly for the poor. At \nleast 40% of the increasing urban population is accommodated in unauthorized or informal \nsettlements.6 These are rarely supplied with infrastructure and social services when they are \nfirst inhabited. Unauthorized settlements on publicly owned land, or katchi abadis,7 predominate \nin Sindh, over unregulated subdivisions of privately owned land, which are a more common form \nof informal development in other provinces.  \n \n4.  The Government has accepted the need to provide services to informal areas, however, \nlimited financial, institutional, and human resources; the lack of priority given to the needs of \ninformal areas; the tendency to work in piecemeal manner; and difficulties with operation and \nmaintenance have resulted in inadequate services to informal areas. Levels of urban services \nwithin the province are low and services in most settlements continue to be far from adequate. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 20 January 2004.  \n2  Sindh is one of Pakistan\u2019s four administrative provinces covering 140,900 square kilometers (17.7% of the total \narea) divided into 16 districts and has a population of 32.3 million (22.9% of the country\u2019s population). \n3  More than two thirds of Sindh is in the brackish water or desert zone, while only 17% is in the freshwater zone. \n4  A significant and sustained effort will be required for social sector development in Sindh, considering that infant \nmortality rate is 83 per 1,000 live births, and life expectancy is estimated at 63 years for men and women. \n5  ADB. 2001. Poverty Assessment Report. Manila, estimates poverty incidence in urban areas in Sindh to be 35.2%.  \n6  The rate of growth of katchi abadis is estimated to be approximately 10% per annum. D. Dowall. 1989. Karachi \nLand and Housing Study, KDA-MPD. \n7  Regularization of katchi abadis involved government recognition of a katchi abadis\u2019 right to exist and the need to \nprovide residents with de-facto security of tenure. They can obtain long-term leases on their land in return for \npayment to government based on the size of plot and the appropriate rate of payment for the size of the plot. \nAlthough Government regularized most katchi abadis containing more than 40 houses in 1985, no further \nregularization has taken place since then. \n ", "2  \nThe percentage of urban dwellers in Sindh with piped water on plot increased from 68% in 1990 \nto  an  estimated  80%  in  2001.  Despite  significant  efforts  to  provide  a  continued  gradual \nimprovement in the percentage of people with water connections, figures show that, because of \npopulation increase, the total number of people without adequate water supply is increasing. \nTotal uncovered population projections indicate that water supply shortages will affect 11 million \npeople living in urban areas in 2014, while more than 9 million people will not have drainage \nsystems in the same year.8 Moreover, even where a distribution system is present, the limited \nperiod of supply and low water pressure increase the likelihood of cross-contamination from \nnearby sewers, endangering water quality. Levels of urban services within the urban centers of \nthe province are low, with coverage and service levels varying greatly between talukas. While \nmost of the medium-size towns have a water supply system, only 35\u201345% of households are \nconnected.  \n \n5.  In many informal areas, pour-flush systems are rapidly replacing crude dry toilets. \nSewerage  and  drainage  is  more  problematic.9 Most informal areas are not sewered, and \nexisting sewers are often in poor condition, badly silted, and need frequent maintenance. Very \nfew sewers discharge to adequate treatment facilities.10 Where official sewers are not present, \nmost households discharge sewage to open drains, either directly or through septic tanks. \nStorm-water drainage facilities in cities are generally poor; the nullahs receive little cleaning and \nmaintenance. This situation is made worse in informal areas, due to lack of overall settlement \nplanning,  poor  maintenance,  and  encroachment  on  drainage  channels.  Many  informal \nsettlements located in poorly drained low-lying land can be subject to flooding resulting in ponds \nof stagnant water providing breeding grounds for mosquitoes and waterborne diseases.  \n \n6.  Formal solid waste management services in Pakistan and in Sindh deal with less than \n50% of solid waste produced, affecting worst the informal settlements.11 Waste material is \nburned, dumped in open spaces, used for uncontrolled landfill and land reclamation, or thrown \ninto drains and watercourses. Waste is also collected by scavengers or transferred to potter\u2019s \nsettlements to be used as fuel in kilns. Informal recycling systems12 cover certain types of waste \nand suffer from high inefficiencies, while hazardous pollutants are disposed of in a random and \nunsafe manner. Uncollected waste represents a serious hazard to both public health and the \nenvironment. Little data is available on the overall percentage of paved streets and lanes in \ninformal areas, but these are generally narrow and poorly maintained and usually characterized \nby poor standards of construction. Lack of paving restricts access and circulation, adversely \naffecting the operation of services such as solid waste collection, and tending to increase the \nduration and impact of flooding.   \n \n7.  Under the Sindh Local Government Ordinance, 2001, tehsil municipal authorities (TMAs) \nheaded by the taluka/town nazims are responsible for planning, investment, and control of \nmunicipal services, including water supply, sanitation, and solid waste disposal. Karachi City \n                                                 \n8  Government of Sindh. 2004, Brief Note on Water Supply and Drainage Schemes of Local Government, LGD/ \nPublic Health Engineering Department. \n9  While sanitation services provided to planned areas in Karachi are estimated at 85%, services to Katchi Abadis are \nreported to cover only 12% of the population, Tabulation of AERC Survey, 1989. \n10  Sewage treatment is generally absent throughout Sindh, with the exception of Karachi, where only an estimated \n50% of the city\u2019s municipal sewage is treated. Areas serviced often do not cover poorer informal settlements. \n11  Solid waste generated in Pakistan ranges between 0.283 and 0.612 kilograms per capita per day, with a reported \ngrowth rate of 2.4% per year. Solid waste management services provided to katchi abadis were reported to cover \napproximately 10% of the total area, Tabulation of AERC Survey, 1989.  \n12 These include large-scale waste dealers (1,000 kabaris are reported to operate in Karachi), and original initiatives \nby nongovernment organizations such as Gul Bahao through its  Safai Kamai garbage purchasing bank, the \nPakistan Environment Recycling Program, and Sheri\u2019s solid waste management public awareness activities. ", "  3\nDistrict has 18 TMAs, while the remaining 15 districts of the province in aggregate, have 84. \nSince devolution, the Public Health Engineering Department merged with the Local Government \nDepartment (LGD) and responsibilities for planning and operating schemes were devolved to \nthe TMAs. Partly due to the inherent problems related to lack of funds and capacity to execute \nthese new responsibilities, the TMAs have not properly assumed the responsibilities envisaged \nunder the 2001 ordinance. TMA capacity building, addressed under the Sindh Devolved Social \nServices Program, needs to be continued under other initiatives. Katchi abadi departments were \nset  up  in  Punjab  and  Sindh  in  the  mid  1980s  to  manage  the  process  of  katchi  abadi \nregularization and to channel funds to upgrade schemes in informal areas. The Sindh Katchi \nAbadi Authority, merged with LGD after devolution, is undertaking innovative and constructive \nwork. \n \n8.  Lessons learned from previous ADBs projects in the sector in Sindh and Pakistan \nindicate that (i) urban upgrading should be designed from a plan that integrates all aspects of \nurban  infrastructure  and  involves  the  participation  of  beneficiaries  in  project  design, \nimplementation,  operation,  and  maintenance;  successful  experiences  have  also  shown \nbeneficiaries commitment through component cost-sharing,13 (ii) institutional capacity must be \ndeveloped, (iii) the financial framework must be in place to ensure long-term sustainability, and \n(iv) awareness raising for sanitation and the environment must be undertaken. The TA supports \nPakistan\u2019s Ten-Year Perspective Development Plan (2001\u20132011).14 The TA is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program (2002\u20132006), which emphasizes support for governance \nreform programs and devolution, provision of basic urban services and water, inclusive social \ndevelopment, and sustainable environmental management.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The  goal  of  the  TA  is  to  facilitate  sustainable  urban  development  for  low-income \ncommunities in Sindh. Its objective is to assist the Government in preparing a project to improve \nbasic  urban  infrastructure  and  services  in  a  participatory  manner  in  selected  low-income \ncommunities  in  urban  centers  in  Sindh.  The  TA\u2019s  output  will  consist  of  (i)  a  sector  and \ninstitutional  analysis  review  and  data  collection  study,  (ii)  a  participatory  framework  for \ncommunity participation leading to the formulation of priority infrastructure and institutional \narrangements, and (iii) a feasibility study suitable for ADB financing.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  In  keeping  with  the  Government\u2019s  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper,  the  TA  will \nemphasize targeting assistance to the poorest urban areas in Sindh with the most acute \nshortages of drinking water, sanitation, and solid waste management, while supporting inclusive \nsocial development and devolution of authority, strengthening of local government, and seeking \nopportunities to promote women\u2019s participation. The TA will aim to increase transparency, \ncomplementing  activities  undertaken  locally  or  by  other  assisting  agencies,  and  involving \nstakeholders from early stages of the planning and design process. The TA will be implemented \nin an inclusive manner, ensuring that the design of the ensuing Project has not only an \n                                                 \n13  Cost-sharing and component-sharing initiatives, such as those undertaken in Orangi, have resulted in commitment \nand ownership development among communities, awareness raising, and community empowerment. Proposed \ncost-sharing arrangements for the Project should be consistent with the Government\u2019s cost-sharing policies. \n14 Pakistan\u2019s Ten-Year Perspective Development Plan (2001\u20132011) includes the provision of safe drinking water from \nthe current 63% (83% urban and 53% rural) to 84% (96% urban and 75% rural) of the population by 2011. \n ", "4  \nintegrated approach but also draws all actors and stakeholders into the upgrading process in a \nway that validates and strengthens them.  \n \n11.  The TA will be carried out in three phases over 8 months. Phase I will (i) collect and \nreview basic planning data and processes, capabilities, and resources for urban development in \nsecondary urban centers, with particular emphasis in more deprived areas; (ii) conduct a \nsocioeconomic assessment in the identified target areas; (iii) geographically map and analyze \npoverty data, incidence of waterborne diseases, current and projected assistance, concentration \nof  minority  and  disadvantaged  groups,  and  the  distribution  and  capabilities  of  local \nnongovernment  organizations;  (iv)  undertake  engineering  field  surveys  and  mapping  to \nascertain the condition of basic infrastructure and amenities, including current data on water and \nsanitation and solid waste management coverage; (v) identify priority areas15 based on need for \nimproved coverage; (vi) analyze the policy and institutional setup; and (vii) assess existing \nfinancial arrangements. \n \n12.  Phase II will integrate findings from the phase I analysis with local knowledge through a \nprofessionally  facilitated  participatory  process.  Phase  II  will  develop  the  project  framework \nthrough consensus with the various stakeholders to jointly identify and prioritize needs, options, \nand priorities of various groups of the urban population, especially the poorest sectors. The TA \nwill be informed by the water supply and sanitation and solid waste management policies, \nstrategies, and plans developed under the Capacity Building for Environmental Management in \nSindh TA.16 \n \n13.  Phase  III  will  select  and  refine  project  subsector-specific  investment  components; \ndevelop technical options acceptable to all stakeholders; and conduct economic and financial \nfeasibility studies, environmental and social studies, and other documentation as required by \nADB guidelines. An institutional development and capacity-building program will support the \nprioritized infrastructure development project in selected cities.  In addition to  infrastructure \nupgrading, foreseen to include improvements to water supply, sanitation, sewage treatment, \nsolid waste management, drainage, access roads, and footpaths, subcomponents such as \nhealth and hygiene education will be considered. The TA team will coordinate with the Devolved \nSocial Services Program coordination unit to optimize component selection, coverage, and \nsequencing, and prevent duplication in the allocation of funds.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $995,000 equivalent, comprising $475,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $520,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance \n$795,000 equivalent, which will cover the entire foreign exchange cost, and $320,000 equivalent \nof the local currency costs. The remaining $200,000 equivalent will be contributed by the \nGovernment  and  will  include  office  accommodation,  transportation,  counterpart  staff, \nbackground reports, studies and logistics, and workshop facilities. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 3. The Government has been advised \nthat approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n                                                 \n15  Provision, improvement, and rehabilitation of basic urban services in Karachi and Hyderabad are to be included in \nthe proposed Megacity Project I, for which project preparation is expected to take place in 2005. \n16  ADB. 2004.

LGD,  the  Executing  Agency,  will  appoint  a  TA  unit  coordinator  with  a  supportive, \ncoordinating,  and  facilitating  role;  and  provide  office  space,  furniture,  equipment,  and \nprofessional  and  support  counterpart  staff  for  the  TA  consultants  as  necessary.  Overall \nguidance for TA implementation will be provided by a TA steering committee, headed by the \nadditional chief secretary, Planning and Development Department, comprising senior officials \nfrom provincial government agencies, including LGD, Planning and Development Department, \nFinance Department, and  Sindh  Environmental  Protection  Agency; district government and \nTMAs; aid agencies; nongovernment organizations; and private sector groups active in the \nsector. The steering committee will first meet no later than 5 weeks after the start of the TA to \nfinalize  the  appropriate  coverage  area  selection,  and  then  on  a  quarterly  basis  or  more \nfrequently if required, to review TA progress and provide direction, particularly on policy issues.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 8 months from May 2005 to December 2005. A team of \ninternational and domestic consultants will be selected and recruited through a firm by ADB to \nprovide a total of 63 person-months of consulting services comprising 21 person-months of \ninternational consulting and 42 person-months of domestic consulting, which includes 8 person-\nmonths of unallocated consulting services. The consultants will be selected and engaged by \nADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank \nand Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. The outline terms of reference for TA consultants and indicative scheduling are \npresented in Appendix 4. The international consultants will include experts in water supply and \nsanitation, economics, solid waste management, urban governance, policy and institutions, and \nenvironment.  The  domestic  consultants  will  include  experts  in  social  development  and \ncommunity  mobilization,  gender  and  resettlement,  groundwater  and  hydrology,  financial \nanalysis, sewerage, drainage, and environment. ADB\u2019s full technical proposal approach will be \nused in selecting consultants. Workshops will take place in all three phases of the TA, but \nextended consultations (2\u20133 days per urban center) will be held for consensus building during \nphase II. Office equipment to be financed by the TA will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. \n \n17.  The consultants will submit four major reports: (i) an inception report no later than 4 \nweeks after commencement of services; (ii) a midterm report no later than the end of the fourth \nmonth; (iii) a draft final report at the end of the seventh month and (iv) a final report within 4 \nweeks of receiving comments from the Government and ADB on the draft final report. In \naddition, the consultants will submit short monthly progress notes summarizing project activities, \nissues, constraints, and proposed solutions. Tripartite meetings will be held with ADB, the \nGovernment, and the consultants to review the inception, midterm, and draft final reports and \nverify output-to-purpose accomplishments. Key deliverables from this TA will be translated by \nconsultants to facilitate their review by Government and other stakeholders. LGD will complete a \nTA completion questionnaire to evaluate the TA\u2019s inputs and outputs, identify lessons learned, \nand suggest follow-up actions.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $795,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for preparing the Sindh Basic Urban Services Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators and    and Risks \nTargets   \n \nGoal       \nImprove standard of living  Waterborne diseases, and  National and provincial   \nof urban low-income  infant mortality and  statistics (economic, health   \ncommunities in Sindh.  morbidity significantly  care) \n \n  reduced    \n  United Nations Development \n \n  Programme human \n \n  development reports \n \n   \n  Reports and statistics from \n  funding agencies and \nnongovernment organizations \n \nPurpose       \nImprove inclusive  Water quality data records  United Nations Children\u2019s  Assumptions \nsustainable urban  from surface and  Fund reports on water supply,  Areas for intervention promptly \ndevelopment for low- groundwater improved   sanitation and hygiene  identified and agreed to by all \nincome communities in      stakeholders. \nSindh.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nPakistan faces the twin challenges of reviving economic growth and reducing poverty. The incidence of poverty in \nPakistan has risen slowly but steadily during the 1990s, from 29.3% in 1993\u20131994 to 32.2% in 1998\u20131999. Poverty in \nurban areas is estimated to be 22.4%. Only 63% of the country\u2019s population has access to safe drinking water (83% in \nurban areas, and 53% in rural areas). Proper sanitation facilities are available to only 39% of the population (59% in \nurban areas, and 27% in rural areas). Poor access to water supply and sanitation is often associated with poor health. \nConsolidated (federal and provincial) expenditures on water supply and sanitation have actually decreased over the \npast 5 years, both in nominal terms and as a percentage of gross domestic product. As a result, extension of public \nwater supply and sanitation facilities has not kept pace with the growing needs of the rising population. Poverty \nincidence in urban areas in Sindh affects one third of the population, suffering from a lack of employment, low \nhousehold incomes, and lack of basic services. \n \nThe Poverty Partnership Agreement between the Government of Pakistan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nreflects the Government\u2019s vision for poverty reduction and key priorities of ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program. \nADB\u2019s country strategy for Pakistan emphasizes water supply, sanitation and urban development, and the need to \ntarget the poor to reduce both poverty and inequalities. The Government, in its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, \nbuilds on the notion that poverty reduction requires good governance; allocation for social sectors; and improving \nbasic social services, including water supply and sanitation to enhance human development. The Poverty Partnership \nAgreement also focuses on attainment of the Millennium Development Goals, of which provision of drinking water is of \ngreat relevance. Access to safe drinking water, improved sanitation, and improved environmental quality will reduce \nvulnerability to environmental hazards for the poor communities. Improved quantity and quality of domestic water \nsupply and sanitation facilities will reduce morbidity and mortality, especially for young children. The availability of safe \ndrinking water supplies will reduce water-carrying time, which will benefit mainly women and girls.  \n \n \nB.  Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?   \n \nA multidimensional poverty analysis will be required for the Project. Although a good starting source, national and \nprovincial survey data does not contain detail data at the local level. Data at taluka level on population, illiteracy, water \nand electricity availability, and other human development indexes will be utilized as part of the coverage selection \ncriteria, however this will be refined, as talukas under the devolution process cover both urban and rural areas. A \ndetailed socioeconomic survey will be conducted for selected urban centers and data collected will include income and \nexpenditure, demographic trends, gender issues, health, water and sanitation, child labor, and urban environment. \nThe findings of the socioeconomic baseline survey will be used to improve the access of the poor to existing and \nnewly created infrastructure facilities and urban services. Participatory methods and innovative techniques in poverty \nassessment, such as the Alleppey method, will be considered, for identifying most disadvantaged and vulnerable \ngroups. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nStakeholders to participate in the Project include the urban poor, including women; minorities from various nonlocal \ntribes or other religious groups; all tiers of government, especially taluka, district governments, and various provincial \ngovernment  departments  (Local  Government  Department,  Planning  and  Development  Department,  Finance \nDepartment, Department of Health, Sindh Environmental Protection Agency); aid agencies such as United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund, nongovernment organizations; and, where relevant and appropriate, selected members of the private \nsector). \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \n \n \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe participation strategy for the technical assistance (TA) will focus on putting the urban poor at the center of \ndevelopment, through planning and design of the Project, and at a later stage, at the center of implementation, \nmanagement, and operation and maintenance. The Project will involve the communities from phase I by conducting a \nsocioeconomic analysis to include appreciative enquiry and rapid assessment methods, as well as community \nparticipation in the identification and mapping of current urban infrastructure and services. Phase II will put the \ncommunities and town at the center of the design process, which will be carried through to phase III of the Project. \nWorkshops will be carried out with representatives of all stakeholder groups during all three project phases. The \nparticipatory project mechanism will be built on the self-help tradition while honoring local culture. The existing \nstructure of extended households provide natural groupings that can be mobilized, strengthened, and utilized as a \nnucleus for community-based organizations with whom partnership will be built and to whose demands the Project \ncould respond. The citizen community boards can be an excellent entry point to discuss and establish development \noriented community participation. This will provide for grassroots participatory development. This approach ensures (i) \nfull participation of beneficiaries in project design and implementation leading to greater ownership; (ii) a process \napproach; (iii) decentralized and localized implementation arrangements with capacity support to government and \ncommunity groups in implementation and maintenance; and (iv) use of more widely accepted technology. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  \n \nAn important finding of the Participatory Poverty Assessment carried out for the Pakistan Poverty Reduction Strategy \nPaper showed that women are among the poorest and most vulnerable groups in the country. Women are primary \ncollectors, transporters, users, and managers of domestic water and promoters of home and community-based \nsanitation activities. Yet, in Pakistan, women\u2019s views are not systematically represented in decision-making bodies. \nBetter access to water will give women more time for income-generating activities, their welfare, or the needs of family \nmembers; and it empowers them. It will also free children from the drudgery of water collection and management, \nespecially girls who can then go to school. The Project will specifically address gender issues including participation of \nwomen in planning and design, and identification of constraints and opportunities for women to actively contribute to \nthe implementation of the ensuing Project. A gender action plan for the Project will be prepared. Targeting of women \nrequires a modified approach consistent with local culture and traditions in different parts of Pakistan. To create and \ndevelop acceptance for women\u2019s activities, women organizers may visit selected urban centers to identify interested \nleading women and women organizations may be formed. To facilitate this process, social mobilizers can be recruited \nfrom among the most outspoken and conservative community members after their participation in a training workshop \non rights, responsibilities, development process, and empowerment under traditional and customary practices. In \naddition, facilitation may be carried out through specialized nongovernment organizations and women counselors.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?
