INTRODUCTION\n1. During  the  Asian  Development  Bank's  (ADB)  Country  Programming  Confirmation\nMission in 1999, the Government of Bhutan requested technical assistance (TA) to review the\ncurrent status of, and to define the future strategy for, financial sector development. Advisory TA\nfor review of the sector is included in the Bhutan Country Assistance Plan for 2001-2003. A\nFact-Finding Mission visited Bhutan in March 2001 and reached an understanding with the\nGovernment  on  the  objectives,  scope,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and  implementation\narrangements for the TA. The TA framework is provided in Appendix 1.1\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Since Bhutan\u2019s emergence from virtual isolation in the early 1960s, the economy has\nwitnessed considerable transformation from one based on subsistence agriculture to a growing,\ndiversifying, and modernizing one. Growth in industry and services has outstripped that in\nagriculture. As a result, the share of gross domestic product (GDP) accounted for by agriculture\ndeclined from 53 percent in 1983 to 37 percent in 1999, while that of industry doubled to\n34 percent and that of the services sector remained at about 29 percent. At the same time,\nmajor improvements have occurred in social indicators, governance, and the standard of living.\nNevertheless,  Bhutan  is  still  a  poor  country:  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme\n(UNDP) classifies it as a least developed country, it ranks 142 out of 172 countries on UNDP\u2019s\nhuman development index, and it has a per capita GDP of $618. However, although the low per\ncapita income reflects widespread poverty, welfare support provided by the state mitigates\nmany of its more depressing effects.\n3. The private sector in Bhutan contributes less than 25 percent of GDP. There are roughly\n200  registered  companies,  most  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  engaged  in\nhandicrafts,  handmade  paper,  food  processing,  wood  products,  and  construction  activities.\nHowever, through the Government program of privatizing state-owned firms in such industries\nas cement, ferrous alloys, calcium carbide, food products, and electricity, sector diversification\nhas been deepened and the upgrading of domestic skills has been promoted. The private sector\nis also expected to play a greater role in absorbing the growing number of young and educated\nBhutanese,  as  public  sector  employment  opportunities  are  expected  to  be  limited.\nNotwithstanding the Government\u2019s firm commitment of support, there are major impediments to\nprivate sector development, including a narrow range of products, high dependence on a few\nreadily accessible export markets (India accounts for 90 percent of Bhutan\u2019s export earnings),\npoor domestic transportation, constraints arising from national sensitivities concerning resource\nexploitation (especially for tourism and logging), apprehensions over foreign investment and the\nemployment of foreign labor. A recent survey by the World Bank Group's SME Department\nconcluded that the major constraints facing Bhutanese entrepreneurs include unduly limited\naccess to credit due to unreasonably high requirements for collateral, along with unfairly low\nasset valuations, high interest rates on loans, short maturity of term loans, lack of capacity for\nmarket  analysis  within  local  banks,  and  lack  of  access  to  credit  for  newly  established\nbusinesses.2\n                                                          \n1 The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Version) on 18 December 2000.\n2  Draft  Proposal  to  Establish  the  South  Asian  Program  for  Enterprise  Development,  International  Finance\nCorporation and World Bank, March 2001.", "2\n4. ADB  has  played  an  important  role  in  developing  Bhutan's  financial  system  and\nsupporting private sector development there. In fact, ADB is Bhutan\u2019s principal development\npartner in the financial sector. In addition to the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA), which fulfills\nthe role of a central bank, there are five other financial institutions: two commercial banks\u2013Bank\nof  Bhutan  (BOB)  and  Bhutan  National  Bank  (BNB);  the  Bhutan  Development  Finance\nCorporation (BDFC), a development finance institution; the Royal Insurance Corporation of\nBhutan (RICB); and the Royal Security Exchange of Bhutan (RSEB). BNB and RSEB were\nestablished with ADB assistance.3 The Financial Sector Development Program, adopted by the\nGovernment  in  1997,  was  formulated  under  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Sector  Intermediation  Facility\n(FSIF), comprising a policy loan, a development finance loan, and an equity investment in BNB.4\nThe policy loan promotes an efficient and competitive financial sector by improving resource\nallocation and enhancing institutional capabilities, and supports development of SMEs in the\nprivate sector by removing policy impediments and creating an enabling operational and legal\nenvironment. The development finance loan provides an umbrella credit line to BDFC and BNB\nto finance the long-term foreign exchange requirements of small and medium size private sector\nindustrial,  commercial,  and  agricultural  projects.  The  equity  investment  was  designed  to\ncatalyze private sector participation in BNB to enable it to promote competition, expand sources\nof credit for trade and export activities, and provide a demonstration impact for further reforms.\n5. The FSIF addresses a wide range of policy reforms to remove impediments to private\nsector development, including (i) rationalizing Government control over private sector business\nactivities,  (ii)  liberalizing  the  interest  rate  structure,  (iii)  improving  the  efficiency  and\ncompetitiveness of the financial system, (iv) setting up an enabling legal framework for the\nfinancial  system  and  private  sector  business  activities,  (v)  improving  private  sector\nentrepreneurship and management skills and access to information, and (vi) enhancing human\nresource  development  and  capacity  building  in  financial  institutions.  To  implement  these\nobjectives, the Government committed to reform the policy framework to remove impediments\nto  private  sector  development  and  to  take  necessary  actions  as  policy  conditions.  The\nGovernment  has  made  substantial  progress  in  implementing  the  policy  conditions  of  the\nprogram and is about to meet the compliance criteria of the second tranche release conditions.5\n6. An emerging issue in the financial sector relates to excess liquidity, which has been\ncaused by several factors.6 First are the structural impediments limiting the domestic absorptive\ncapacity  for  investment  such  as  the  country's  landlocked  nature,  small  domestic  market,\nnascent  private  sector,  and  shortage  of  skilled  labor.  The  second  is  the  complexity  of\nGovernment  macroeconomic,  industrial,  trade,  and  foreign  investment  policies  such  as\npersistent balance of payment surplus, prudent fiscal operation, RMA\u2019s limited measures for\n                                                          \n3 TA 2284\u2013BHU: Conversion of the Unit Trust of Bhutan to a Commercial Bank, for $146,500, approved on\n4 January 1995; TA 2532\u2013BHU: Restructuring of the Unit Trust to a Commercial Bank, for $590,000, approved on\n13 February 1996; and TA 1699\u2013BHU: Capital Market and Stock Exchange Center Development, for $224,250,\napproved on 15 May 1992.\n4  Loans 1565/1566 BHU: Financial Sector Intermediation Facility, approved on 23 October1997, comprising: policy\nloan  $4 million; development finance loan, $4 million; and equity investment, $600,000.\n5 These are (i) issuing a set of policies and regulations regarding foreign direct investment; (ii) issuing a set of import\nlicensing regulations; (iii) removing any form of Government subsidy to the Government Employment Provident\nFund; (iv) improving RMA\u2019s prudential guidelines and strengthen the banking supervision function; (v) establishing\nclearing and settlement system outside of Thimphu; (vi) creating a credit information bureau and an interbank\nmarket; and (vii) passing legislation of the Real and Personal Movable and Immovable Act, Bankruptcy Act, the\nNegotiable Instruments Act, and Amendments to the Companies Act. (i) and (ii) have been outstanding but will be\nimplemented soon.\n6 This is evidenced by the build up by the two commercial banks\u2019 reserves at RMA and foreign exchange holdings.\nThe total amount of Nu6,348 million ($149.3 million) accounts for roughly 76 percent of the two commercial banks'\nassets.", "3\nmonetary control, and the case-by-case approach to foreign investment approval. The third is\nthe insufficient capacity of intermediation in the financial sector caused by such things as rigid\nand conservative credit control systems in the financial institutions and the underdeveloped\ncapital market. A major developmental challenge is the use of the liquidity to underpin private\nsector growth through improved financial intermediation.\n7. An important systemic issue\u2013one that Bhutan shares with about 60 other countries\u2013is\nthe small size of its financial system.7 The primary concern is whether financial systems of such\nsmall  size  can  effectively  develop  along  the  lines  of  much  larger  ones,  or  whether  the\ndisadvantages of smallness can be overcome best by openness and integration into larger\nsystems. It will be useful to explore whether there are advantages, in Bhutan\u2019s case, of adopting\na differentiated approach, including importing financial services and expertise.\n8. Bhutan\u2019s  acceleration  of  economic  activity  has  been  accompanied  by  substantial\nexpansion in the financial sector. Over the past 20 years, the sector\u2019s contribution to GDP has\nincreased at a real annual rate of 12 percent, compared with the average annual growth in GDP\nof 6.4 percent. Private sector participation in the economy has also increased in line with an\nimproved  incentive  framework  and  as  some  public  activities  have  been  privatized.  The\nGovernment\u2019s Eighth Five-Year Development Plan (1998-2002) envisions annual GDP growth\nof 6.5 percent. To achieve this, continued development of the financial and private sectors will\nbe essential. The sectors\u2019 development will be necessary to underwrite the envisioned reduction\nin poverty.8 The private sector will be the major source for income and employment generation,\nand an efficient financial sector will provide the necessary financial intermediation by mobilizing\nfunds  from  depositors  for  those  potential  entrepreneurs  who  will  implement  business\ninvestment.\n9. In light of the emerging issues in the financial sector, and its role in supporting the\nachievement of growth and poverty reduction targets, it is important to take stock of the current\nstatus of the sector, to undertake a diagnosis of its strengths and weaknesses, and to map out a\nstrategic vision for its development. This will provide the Government with a framework for\nreviewing sector issues, determining the design of the sector, prioritizing sector developments,\nproperly  sequencing  reforms,  determining  how  best  the  financial  sector  can  support  SME\ndevelopment,  and  determining  how  the  Government  might  enlist  the  assistance  of  its\ndevelopment partners in the most productive way.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n10. The main objectives of the TA are to (i) assist the Government to develop a vision of and\nto prepare a medium- and long-term strategy for financial sector development, especially as this\nrelates to development of the private sector and SMEs; and (ii) assist development partners in\ncoordinating future support over the next several years in the context of the overall financial\nsector strategy.\n11. The TA will adopt a participatory approach for developing the vision and strategy among\nall stakeholders, including policy makers, financial institutions, clients of financial institutions,\n                                                          \n7  Measured in terms of broad money supply (M2), about 60 countries have financial systems less than $1 billion.\n(See Policy for Small Financial Systems, Biagio Bossone, Patrick Honohan, and Millard Long, July 2000).\n8  The draft Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement between the Government and ADB (21 June 2001) provides a\nframework for reducing poverty and includes focus on private sector development.", "4\nand private sector business people, with the goals of building a consensus for reform and\nidentifying a critical mass of competent counterpart personnel for the long term.\nB.  Scope\n12. The  TA  will  review  the  accomplishments  of  the  Government\u2019s  past  programs  and\npolicies, including those supported by TAs and loans provided by aid agencies, to improve the\nfinancial sector with the aim of efficient fund mobilization for development of the private sector,\nespecially SMEs.\n13. The TA will provide further in-depth diagnostic analysis of the existing structure and\nperformance of the financial sector, identifying gaps, constraints, and weaknesses that are\nhindering the efficient mobilization and allocation of funds for the development of the private\nsector.\n14. The Policy Framework: The TA will (i) examine the Government\u2019s macroeconomic\npolicy objectives in the circumstance of excess liquidity in the financial sector without increasing\ncredit to the private sector; (ii) reassess the Government\u2019s policy for enhancing financial sector\nintermediation  and  efficiency;  (iii)  examine  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  for  a  small\nfinancial system like Bhutan's to import financial services; (iv) rationalize Government control\nover  private  sector  SME  business  development;  and  (v) evaluate  the  major  constraints  to\nprivate sector and SME business development in the context of such enterprises being potential\nclients of the financial sector.\n15. Market infrastructure: The TA will examine the market infrastructure in the banking\nsector and the capital markets.\n16. Institutional capacity and human resource development: The TA will (i) examine the\nexisting institutional capacity of policymaking Government agencies for the financial sector and\nRMA;  (ii)  reassess  the  management  system  of  financial  institutions  from  the  viewpoint  of\ncreating innovation and efficiency in extending financial intermediation and functioning of a\nproper incentive system. Identify institutional strengthening measures for RSEB and brokerage\nfirms; and (iii) review the necessary environment for dissemination of information on investment\nopportunities and enhancing entrepreneurial skills.\n17. The  TA  will  also  analyze  the  prospective  role  of  financial  sector  development  in\nsupporting private sector development. The World Bank is also scheduled to begin a private\nsector survey in mid-September 2001, which will be complementary to the TA. The TA will\nassist the Government in drafting a step-by-step plan for implementing the policy reforms\nprogram identifying possible areas for external support. The output of the TA and the World\nBank's survey will be inputs to the Ninth Five-Year Development Plan (2003-2007).\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n18. The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $355,000 equivalent, comprising $290,800 in\nforeign exchange and $64,200 equivalent in local currency (Appendix 2). ADB will provide\n$300,000 equivalent on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA Program to cover the entire\nforeign exchange cost of $290,800 and $9,200 equivalent of the local currency cost. The\nGovernment will finance the remaining $55,000 equivalent of local currency costs through the\nprovision of office space, secretarial services, counterpart staff, report and communications\nfacilities, workshops, and local travel.", "5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n19. RMA will be the executing agency. It will provide one full-time counterpart staff member,\nthe main responsibilities of whom will be to facilitate access of the consultants to relevant\ninformation and to provide assistance during consultations with concerned financial institutions\nand agencies. He or she will have sufficient qualifications and experience in policy, market\ninfrastructure, and human resources development issues in the financial sector in Bhutan. In\naddition, the Government will provide adequate secretarial and clerical support, furnished and\nequipped office accommodation, and domestic transport.\n20. At  the  commencement  of  the  TA,  RMA  will  hold  an  orientation  meeting  with  the\nstakeholders including Government agencies, policy makers, financial institutions, and private\nbusiness people. An interim participatory meeting will be held one and a half months after\ncommencement, and a final participatory meeting will be held after submission of the draft final\nreport.\n21. An international consulting firm will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The consultant team will provide 7.5 person-months of\nservices and will comprise four specialists: (i) financial sector policy specialist (3), (ii) financial\nsector and information technology operations specialist (2), (iii) capital markets specialist (1),\nand (iv) private sector\u2013SME development specialist (1.5).
