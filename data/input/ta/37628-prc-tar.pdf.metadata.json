The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to the Ministry of Railways \n(MOR) for support of railway passenger and freight policy reform. The fact-finding mission \nvisited the PRC in October 2005, and reached an understanding with the Government on the \nTA\u2019s objectives, scope, terms of reference, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation \narrangements. The TA is included in the ADB 2005 country program for the PRC.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Economic growth in the PRC was rapid over the past two decades, reaching 9.4% in \n2004. The rapid economic growth has resulted in a 9% annual growth in passenger transport \nand a 7.4% growth in freight transport from 1978 to 2004. During that period, railway freight \ngrew from 535 billion tons/kilometer (km) to 1,929 billion tons/km, equivalent to an annual \ngrowth rate of 5.1%; and passenger traffic grew at 6.6% annually, increasing from 109 billion \npassenger-km to 522 billion passenger-km. Despite this growth in traffic, the railway lost modal \nshare for both freight and passengers. By the end of 2004, the PRC\u2019s railway system comprised \n74,408 route-km, and carried about a third of the PRC\u2019s freight and passenger traffic.  \n \n3.  The Government\u2019s railway development policy focuses on (i) removing constraints and \nexpanding the railway system, (ii) encouraging construction of joint venture local railways to \npromote the development of local economies, (iii) improving the railway system\u2019s efficiency by \nusing new technology and modern management tools for planning and operations, (iv) reducing \noperating subsidies through appropriate pricing and commercialization of services, (v) initiating \ninstitutional and structural reforms to increase MOR\u2019s autonomy and accountability, and (vi) \nencouraging nongovernment investment in infrastructure and related services.  \n \n4.  The  tenth  5-year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  identifies  transportation,  including  railway \ndevelopment, as a priority. The plan envisages (i) building 6,000 km of new lines to access \npreviously unserved areas, with the network reaching 74,000 km; (ii) providing 3,000 km of \ndouble lines, and electrifying 5,000 km of key lines to increase capacity; and (iii) increasing \noperating speeds on 5,000 km, with the total length of such lines reaching 15,000 km. The plan \nfor the railway sector includes investing CNY350 billion: CNY270 billion for capital construction \nand CNY80 billion for rolling stock. During 2003\u20132007, investments in capital construction are \nexpected  to  reach  CNY450  billion.  To  complement  the  expansion  of  that  capacity,  the \nGovernment has emphasized the need to accelerate reforms in the railway sector. \n  \n5.  In 2004, the State Council approved the new Railway Development Plan covering the \nperiod up to 2020. The plan seeks to expand the railway network from 72,000 km to 85,000 km \nby 2010, and to 100,000 km by 2020. Increasing train speed is identified as a major goal. Train \nspeed will be raised to over 200 km per hour on the trunk network by 2020. Priority will be given \nto the development of railways in unserved areas and regions that lack transport and have \nremained less developed. The route network length will increase by 16,000 km in the western \nregion of the PRC to reach a network length of 40,000 km by 2020. To improve operational \nefficiency,  MOR  has  initiated  action  to  separate  passenger  and  freight  trains  on  key  rail \ncorridors.2  \n \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 2 April 2005. \n2 ADB is financing the first passenger-dedicated corridor under ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Zhengzhou\u2013Xi\u2019an \nRailway Project. Manila (Loan 2182-PRC). \n ", "2   \n6.  ADB's strategy for the railway sector focuses on (i) expanding the railway system by \nconstructing new lines in unserved areas that are less developed and poor; (ii) modernizing and \nincreasing the capacity to improve transport efficiency on key routes of the national railway \nsystem;  (iii)  commercializing  railway  operations  to  sustain  efficient  operations;  and  (iv) \nincreasing railway competitiveness in the transport sector through restructuring and reform.  \n \n7.  Japan is the major source of external financing in the PRC railway sector, followed by \nADB and World Bank. Since 1979, Japan through the Japan Bank for International Cooperation \nhas provided about Y558 billion for 15 railway projects to expand rail transportation capacity. \nSince 1984, the World Bank has provided 10 loans totaling over $2.4 billion for nine national \nrailway  projects  to  expand  capacity  on  high-priority  corridors,  modernize  systemwide \ntechnology, and strengthen institutional capabilities and one local railway project.  \n \n8.  ADB has focused on the development of railways in less developed inland provinces to  \npromote growth and reduce poverty. It has provided 13 loans totaling $2.64 billion to finance the \nconstruction of about 1,931 km of provincial railways operated by joint ventures with MOR, and \n4,604 km of new railway lines under national railway projects. Policy dialogue has been a \nsignificant  component  of  ADB  assistance  to  the  railway  sector  and  has  effectively \ncomplemented the lending operations. Since 2002 there has been active engagement of policy \ndialogue and discussion with MOR, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), \nand Ministry of Finance (MOF). There is broad agreement on reforms as an engine to further \ndevelopment of railways in the transport sector. Since 1989 the PRC railway has received 11 \nTAs for policy reforms, institutional development (local railways), strengthening of commercial \nand business operations, marketing and business development, tariff setting with improved cost \nrecovery,  developing  human  resources,  and  improving  the  financial  management  and \naccounting systems.  \n \n9.  MOR  is  in  a  transition  phase  from  building  transport  capacity  to  institutional \ndevelopment. The Government has broadly defined the framework of railway restructuring to \nseparate government functions from enterprise functions; separate rail from nonrail functions; \nrationalize staff in core transportation, spin-off peripheral operations, and noncore operations; \nand reform the railway investment and financing system. ADB has enhanced its policy dialogue \nwith MOR, NDRC, and MOF. The World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand  Development  (OECD)  have  also  been  engaged  in  dialogues  on  many  policy  issues \nconcerning the PRC railways. OECD3 considered possible approaches to restructuring the PRC \nrailways. The conclusion was that, considering that rail reform takes time, determination of the \nreform path for the PRC railways should start now if the railway sector is to be effective by 2010. \nThere is broad agreement on reforms in the transport sector for further railway development. \nThe new Railway Development Plan (2004) sets major goals and the reform agenda up to 2020. \nThe plan seeks to (i) study and learn from worldwide experience, (ii) clearly identify core \noperations and separate core and noncore transportation businesses, (iii) rationalize and reduce \nstaff, (iv) reform the railway investment and financing system, and (v) establish specialized \ntransportation companies.  \n \n10.  Progress has been achieved as MOR has adopted a structured approach to railway \nreform. A new management concept, the Asset Operating Liability System, was introduced as a \npilot project in 1999. Under this system MOR entered into management contracts with railway \nadministrations  to  improve  profitability.  The  management  contracts  helped  improve  the \noperational and financial performance of the railway administrations. The system has since \n                                                 \n3 Summary and recommendations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and \nDevelopment Research Center seminar on Railway Reform in Beijing on 28\u201329 January 2002.  ", "  3\nbeen extended to all railway administrations. Separation of core and noncore businesses is a \nkey  element  of  MOR\u2019s  restructuring  program.  The  total  number  of  employees  in  the  core \ntransportation business has been reduced from 1.89 million in 1997 to 1.55 million in 2004. In \nthe  noncore  transportation  business,  five  large  companies  employing  616,500  have  been \ndivested. To provide jobs for redundant staff, by the end of 2004 MOR had set up 5,800 \ndiversified businesses (independent of the core transportation business) employing more than \n416,000 people to supply equipment, goods, and services to the railway industry. In 1998, MOR \ninitiated a cost-sharing scheme for health insurance and pensions for railway employees. In \n2004, MOR completed the transfer of 826 educational institutes and 208 hospitals to local \ngovernments. One hundred branch lines comprising 7,800 km of route have been separated to \nimprove productivity and reduce operating losses. \n \n11.  MOR  has  taken  several  measures  to  improve  the  operational  and  management \ninformation systems for the railways, e.g., development and introduction of the Transportation \nManagement Information System; computerized ticketing systems in 700 stations and 7,000 \nticket  sales  points,  accounting  for  95%  of  passengers;  and  use  of  an  interline  revenue \nsettlement system.  MOR is introducing a state-of-the-art dispatch management information \nsystem in all 18 railway administrations and 70 major trunk lines (expected to be completed by \n2005), and will introduce centralized traffic control on several trunk lines by 2007. Consistent \nwith growth in multimodal transport, container transport in the railway sector has grown at three \ntimes the rate of ordinary freight traffic. MOR has set up an independent container company4 \nand plans to build 18 large container terminals by 2007.  \n \n12.  Even though in recent years the PRC railways have made significant progress and \nnotable achievements, they are still unable to meet the increasing demand for passenger and \nfreight transportation. High economic growth rates and increasing urbanization are the two \nmajor causes of the high transport demand. With the gross domestic product (GDP) expected to \ngrow at 7%, and 60% of the rural population expected to move to urban areas (400 million) by \n2020, the challenges for increased transportation capacity and quality of service offered are \nenormous. The PRC railways, which are an integral part of the PRC transport market, face \ntremendous challenges not only for investment requirements but also for creating an enabling \nenvironment to meet the growing demand for transport. Given this background, the Government \nand MOR sought ADB assistance to help the PRC railways review the passenger and freight \ntransport demand structure and assist in preparing a reform plan to meet these challenges.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the proposed TA is an efficient, reliable, and competitive railway transport \nsystem in the PRC.  The outcome of the TA is a policy reform plan for the railway passenger \nand freight transport in line with the Government\u2019s envisaged development goals. The TA will (i) \nassist the Government to review the impacts of the changes in the PRC transport market \ndemand  on  PRC  railway  passenger  and  freight  transport;  (ii)  assess  the  current  level  of \npreparedness of MOR to address these impacts, and (iii) make recommendations on the action \nand policy reform support to enable the PRC railways to adequately meet these challenges. The \nstudy will look at the conflicting roles of meeting social obligations and making profits, increasing \nmodal competition, impacts due to the fast pace of urbanization and economic development, \n                                                 \n4 ADB and MOR agreed on the separation of container businesses as part of the ADB-financed Yichang\u2013Wanzhou \nRailway Project. (ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a \nProposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Yichang\u2013Wanzhou Railway Project. Manila.) \n ", "4   \nand demand for delivery of improved services. The study will also look at the possibility of \ninnovative  passenger  and  freight  transportation  projects  or  products  to  enhance  the \ncompetitiveness of the railway sector and improve customer satisfaction. To achieve these \nobjectives, the study will examine opportunities for diversified financing sources, increased \nprivate sector involvement, and the possibility of public-private sector partnerships. The study \nwill research the existing work done by the PRC railways, make use of experience with similar \nreforms in other railways (international), involve active participation of railway management, and \nhelp in preparing a policy reform plan that MOR can implement. Appendix 1 gives the design \nand monitoring framework. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  International consultants, supported by domestic consultants, will be engaged to help the \nGovernment prepare the policy reform plan. The consultants will (i) undertake an analytical \nreview of the status of the railway sector in the PRC transport market, and prepare a sector \nupdate;  (ii)  review  the  relevant  development  plans  for  railways;  (iii)  identify  long-term \ndevelopment  needs;  and  (iv)  recommend  necessary  policy  reforms,  and  regulatory \nrequirements  for  developing  the  railway  passenger  and  freight  markets  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s envisaged development goals. The TA will be undertaken in close consultation \nwith the Government, MOR, NDRC, and other relevant agencies. The study will build on ADB\u2019s \nongoing policy dialogue and the outputs of the recent TA for policy reform support.5 It will \nconsider  all  previous  studies  by  the  Government,  ADB,  World  Bank,  OECD,  and  other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  agencies.  The  TA  will  involve  analytical  and  innovative  research, \nfieldwork, training, and stakeholder consultations with the Government, private sector, user \ngroups, and international development partners. \n \n15.  Key activities will include a review of existing studies by MOR, the Government, other \nmultilateral institutions; data analysis; and consultation with other stakeholders, including MOF, \nNDRC, and government officials. An international training program with participation from the \nrelevant departments will be organized to learn from experiences of other railways. A workshop \nwill be organized at the interim stage of report preparation to discuss and review the findings of \nthe study, and a seminar will be organized at the final stage to disseminate the findings of the \nTA.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $520,000 equivalent, comprising of $330,000 in \nforeign exchange and $190,000 equivalent in local currency (Appendix 2). ADB will provide \n$400,000 to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $70,000 equivalent of the local currency \ncost. ADB will finance the TA on a grant basis from ADB's TA funding program. MOR will \nprovide the remaining $120,000 equivalent in local currency for counterpart staff, office facilities, \nand support services.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  As the Executing Agency, MOR will be responsible for supervising and monitoring TA \nactivities. A steering committee\u2014comprising representatives of relevant departments of MOR \n(Policy  Reform  and  Regulation  Department,  Passenger  Transportation  Department,  Freight \nTransportation Department, and Planning Department), and chaired by the director general, \n                                                 \n5 ADB. 2004.

In addition, MOR will appoint a project \ncoordinator who will supervise and coordinate day-to-day TA activities, including monitoring of \nprogress,  resolving  problems,  arranging  meetings,  and  liaising  with  concerned  government \nagencies, including MOF and NDRC. To facilitate the work of the consultants and ensure that \nMOR benefits from their experience, MOR will also provide adequate counterpart staff with \nrelevant work experience during TA implementation. MOR and other appropriate ministries will \nprovide policy guidance to the consultants. MOR and concerned ministries will meet to discuss \nthe consultants\u2019 report at inception, interim, and final draft stages. A workshop and a seminar \nwill be held to review the findings at the interim and final stages of report preparation. The \nmeetings will have representatives of MOR, MOF, NDRC, other relevant agencies, ADB, and \nthe consultants. A final report will be published when the TA ends. \n \n18.  An international consulting firm in association with domestic consultants will be engaged \nby ADB using the simplified technical proposal procedures based on the quality- and cost-based \nselection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The TA will require about \n15 person-months of international and about 10 person-months of domestic consulting services \nto carry out the terms of reference (Appendix 3). The international consultants will have prior \nPRC experience and have expertise in the following fields: (i) transport policy and regulation \nissues as related to railways; (ii) transport economics including fiscal, planning, and pricing \nissues;  (iii)  railway  freight  transportation  and  management;  and  (iv)  railway  passenger \ntransportation and management. The international consultants will be encouraged to utilize \ndomestic consultants, with expertise in (i) railway policy and regulation, (ii) transport economics, \n(iii) railway freight transportation, and (iv) railway passenger transportation.  The TA is expected \nto commence in March 2006 and be completed by September 2006. Procurement of equipment, \nsupplies,  and  materials  by  consultants  under  the  TA  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. The equipment will be turned over to MOR after TA completion.  \n \n19.  The  Government  and  MOR  have  agreed  to  provide  assistance  required  for  TA \nimplementation in a timely manner. MOR will make available to the consultants  (i) all relevant \nreports,  including  rules  and  regulations,  studies,  and  information  required  for  TA \nimplementation; (ii) offices and qualified counterpart staff; and (iii) other needed assistance, \nincluding liaison with the Government and local authorities. \n \nIV.
