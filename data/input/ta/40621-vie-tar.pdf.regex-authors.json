The Government of Viet Nam (the Government) requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and other development partners for technical assistance (TA) to undertake a detailed \nreview of the water sector (the Review). The design and scope of the Review have been \ndeveloped  through  a  series  of  meetings  between  the  Government  and  representatives  of \nexternal funding agencies involved in Viet Nam\u2019s water sector from October 2005 to September \n2006. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 ADB was requested by the \nGovernment and its development partners to coordinate the TA. ADB reached an understanding \nwith  the  Government  on  the  TA\u2019s  expected  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost estimates, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting \nservices in December 2006. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Viet Nam has achieved remarkable economic growth2 and reductions in poverty over the \nlast decade, from about 58.1% in 1993, to 23.2% in 2004, and an estimated 22.0% in 2005. \nGross domestic product (GDP) per capita increased from $288 in 1993 to $622 in 2005, with a \nmarginal increase in inequality. Strong economic growth has been accompanied by increasingly \nrapid urbanization and significant increases in wages and quality of life. However, this growth \nhas included some less positive changes, such as high rural\u2013urban migration, and is placing \nheavy pressures on the country\u2019s dilapidated infrastructure and fragile natural resource base.  \n \n3.  Although Viet Nam is a high rainfall country, averaging 1,940 millimeters per year, it is \nnot rich in water. Increasing competition for reliable water resources may constrain economic \ngrowth and the creation of livelihood opportunities. Currently, average annual per capita surface \nwater availability is about 3,840 cubic meters (m3),3 based on water resources generated within \nnational borders. Viet Nam can be considered a water deficient nation and is predicted to face \nincreasingly difficult challenges with water resources in the near future. Allowing for projected \npopulation  growth  and  taking  the  expected  impacts  of  climate  change  into  consideration, \naverage annual per capita surface water availability will be approximately 2,830 m3 by 2025. \nCross-border river flows increase the projected water availability to about 7,660 m3 per capita, \nbut this figure disguises substantial seasonal and spatial disparities. Droughts are frequent and \nprolonged, and nearly two thirds of the surface water inflows from neighboring countries are \nconcentrated in the Mekong River delta.  \n4.  Demands for water resources are growing rapidly, not just for extraction but also to \nincrease hydropower generation to satisfy the expanding economy and growing population. \nGroundwater is increasingly used in both rural areas and major urban centers, but groundwater \nlevels are falling dramatically in some areas, resulting in land subsidence and damage to \ninfrastructure. Some groundwater sources have elevated levels of arsenic.  \n5.  The crucial role of water in the nation\u2019s sustainable development, human health, and life \nhas not always been fully appreciated; its value as a scarce natural resource and economic \ngood has not always been recognized. As a result, the protection and management of water \nresources  has  not  been  given  adequate  attention.  An  earlier  review  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s  water \nresources  in  1995\u20131996  helped  identify  problems  and  the  range  of  options  available  to \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 27 November 2006.  \n2  GDP growth has averaged 7.5% per annum over the past decade. \n3  The International Water Resources Association defines average per capita water availability less than 4,000 m3 per \nyear as inadequate water supply. \n ", "2   \novercome them. The review4 formulated strategies to help guide the Government\u2019s investment \nprograms.  \n6.  The water sector still faces substantial challenges, including (i) increasing competition \nfor  heavily  committed  freshwater  resources;  (ii)  increasing  pollution  of  rivers  by  industrial, \nmunicipal,  and  agricultural  sources;  (iii)  increasingly  severe  and  frequent  natural  disasters \naffecting  a  rising  population  living  in  disaster-prone  areas.  These  challenges  highlight  the \nurgency for the Government to complete sector reforms to separate the tasks of regulation, \ndelivery of services, and policy leadership in the water sector. Groundwater is being extracted at \nunsustainable rates; few water service providers operate in a financially viable way; much of the \nexisting water management infrastructure is in poor repair and needs to be replaced; and most \nsuitable land is already under irrigation with diminishing opportunities for increasing production. \nFurthermore, development of basic water services has not kept pace with economic growth, \nleaving around one third of the population without adequate water supplies and two thirds of the \npopulation without sanitation. Viet Nam is on target to meet Millennium Development Goal \n(MDG) 10 (halving the number of persons without access to safe water and sanitation in urban \nareas) but progress in rural areas remains behind target.5 \n \n7.  The Government has made substantial progress in water sector reforms since 1995. \nSpecific reforms include (i) passage of a water law in 1998;6 (ii) establishment of the Ministry of \nNatural Resources and Environment (MONRE) in 2002;7 (iii) establishment of the National \nWater Resources Council (NWRC), chaired by the deputy prime minister,8 as the water sector \napex body; and (iv) adoption of the sustainability concepts reflected in the (a) National Strategy \nfor  Environmental  Protection;  (b)  Strategic  Orientation  for  Sustainable  Development \n(Agenda 21); (c) National Water Resources Strategy (NWRS);9 (d) Law on Water Resources; \n(e) Law on Environmental Protection; and (f) adoption of a rural water supply and sanitation \nstrategy following the multi-funding agency review of the subsector in 2005. These actions \nsignal an important shift toward recognition of the importance of a sustainable and healthy \nnatural resource base. Such recognition is a critical ingredient in the Government's efforts to \nachieve sustainable socioeconomic development, and is fully consistent with the ADB water \npolicy.10  \n \n8.  In its NWRS, the Government defined the main objectives for the water sector in the \nnext 15 years as the protection, efficient exploitation, and sustainable development of water \nresources  on  the  basis  of  integrated  and  unified  water  resources  management.  The \nGovernment  intends  to  meet  water  demands  for  people\u2019s  living  and  socioeconomic \ndevelopment, while ensuring national defense, national security, and environmental protection \nas the country\u2019s industrialisation and modernisation proceed. The Government is encouraging \nproactive prevention to control and mitigate the adverse impacts of water-related disasters, \nwhile developing multisector industries that utilize water resources. Viet Nam places high priority \non improved international cooperation and the harmonious sharing of water resources.  \n \n                                                 \n4  Report No. 15041-VN Viet Nam Water Sector Review, May 1996.

The TA will help the Government and its development partners review the current state \nof the water sector\u2014including urban, rural, and basin water subsectors11\u2014and adopt integrated \nwater resources management (IWRM) principles in line with its NWRS objectives. The impact of \nthe TA will be increased contribution of water resources management to poverty reduction and \nsustainable  national  development.  Its  outcome  will  be  a  common  framework  to  guide \ndevelopment decisions in the water resources sector in Viet Nam over the coming 10 years. The \nframework will represent a shared vision for cooperation in the sector. The TA will establish a \nfoundation for further strengthening of the policy, regulatory, and institutional framework for \nimproved IWRM planning and implementation at the national and local levels. The framework \nwill represent a consensus on the water sector among different government agencies and \nstakeholders from the external funding agencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and \nthe private sector.  \n \n10.  The TA will generate a better understanding of the potential contribution of the water \nsector  to  the  achievement  of  the  goals  and  targets  of  the  2006\u20132010  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan (SEDP), which aims to ensure balanced poverty reduction, economic growth, \nand environmental sustainability. The TA outputs will (i) clarify the delineation of functions \namong national, provincial, and local agencies; and (ii) strengthen the capacity for IWRM in \nagencies responsible for planning, management, and regulation of water resources. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will adopt a holistic and inclusive approach, encompassing (i) consultation with \nrelevant  stakeholders,  including  government  agencies  at  central  and  provincial  levels, \ninternational development partners, and the NGO community; (ii) compilation of available data, \nanalysis of previous reviews,12 and derivation of water sector characteristics and trends; and \n(iii) workshop discussions. It will draw on the extensive range of existing reviews, databases, \nand  studies  on  different  aspects  of  water  resources  management,  poverty  reduction, \nsustainable development, and environmental management in Viet Nam.  \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented in four phases: \n \n(i)  An inception phase, during which detailed methodology and an implementation \nplan will be prepared. This phase will culminate in an inception report to be \nsubmitted  for  consideration  by  the  task  force13 within  1  month  of  consultant \nmobilization. \n(ii)  An assessment of the sector status, which will analyze the water balance in \nmajor basins and provinces as the basis for a review of current water use and \ntrends in terms of water quantity (river flows and groundwater); water quality; \nsocioeconomic conditions; water demands present and future; international water \nbasin considerations; environmental values and conditions; legal, policy, and \ninstitutional  arrangements  at  all  levels  (including  resources,  systems,  and \ncapacity); water management experiences from previous programs and projects; \n                                                 \n11  For urban, rural, and basin water sector definitions, see: http://www.adb.org/Water/Operations/WFP/default.asp  \n12  Soussan, J., Nguyen Thuy Nha, Kim J.

This assessment will be reviewed in a multi-stakeholder \nworkshop and consolidated into a sector status report. \n(iii)  The  identification  of  key  sector  management  and  development  issues  and \nfeasible options to address them. An issues and options report will set out the \nadvantages and disadvantages of available options. \n(iv)  Consultations on the issues and options report will enable identification of a \nconsolidated set of recommendations that will be reviewed in a multi-stakeholder \nworkshop. The final recommendations will be integrated into the TA final report, \nwhich will include a summary of the outputs from each phase.  \n  \n13.  The TA will include site visits to selected project locations in the provinces and rapid \nappraisal fieldwork to verify data and collect supporting information at key sites. Fieldwork is \nlikely to include an assessment of the role of water management in the livelihoods of poor rural \ncommunities  in  different  parts  of  the  country  and,  subject  to  resource  constraints,  an \nassessment of the effectiveness of irrigation management companies and the potential role of \nthe private sector in water resources management. Thematic studies of key issues, where \nknowledge gaps are identified, will be prepared with the assistance of appropriate national \nresearch and policy development institutions. \n \n14.  The TA\u2019s outputs will be assessments of (i) achievements and present status of the \nwater sector in Viet Nam, including knowledge of water resources and trends in water use, \navailability, sustainability over recent years, and challenges and issues; (ii) diagnostic analysis \nof the policy, regulatory, and institutional framework for water resources management, including \nprogress  toward  achieving  IWRM  and  the  relationship  of  water  resources  management  to \nViet Nam\u2019s wider policy goals; and (iii) options and recommendations for future water sector \ndevelopment,  management,  and  sustainable  financing  including  investment  priorities  and \nsequencing. The findings of (i) and (ii) will be documented in the status report. An issues and \noptions report will be prepared to facilitate consultation for identifying recommendations. The \nfinal report, in English and Vietnamese, will include findings and recommendations of (iii).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.

The  Water  Sector  Review  (the  Review)  aims  to  prepare  a  common  framework  for \nguiding development of the water resources sector in Viet Nam over the coming 5\u201310 year \nperiod. Its scope will include (i) review of the present status of the water sector in Viet Nam, \nincluding trends in water use, availability, and sustainability over recent years; (ii) analysis of the \npolicy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  for  water  resources  management,  including \nprogress  toward  achieving  integrated  water  resources  management  (IWRM);  and  (iii) \ndevelopment  of  options  for  future  management  and  water  sector  development,  including \ninvestment priorities and sequence. The Review will generate a better understanding of the \npotential contribution of the water sector to the achievement of the goals and targets of the \n2006\u20132010 Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP).1 \n \n2.  The National Water Resources Council (NWRC) as implementing agency will create a \ntask force2 to guide the Review, represent the interests of relevant agencies at both national \nand provincial levels, and ensure that the Government\u2019s policies and development strategies \nare accurately reflected in its outcomes. Representatives of the funding agency group and \nnational and international nongovernment organizations (NGOs) will be in the task force.  \n \n3.  The  implementation  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  require  the  services  of  a \nmultidisciplinary team of international and national consultants. A consulting firm, or association \nof firms, will be engaged to provide these services and work closely with the counterpart staff of \nthe TA task force: a total of 84.0 person-months of services from international (14.5 person-\nmonths)  and  national  (69.5  person-months)  consultants  will  be  required.  The  international \nconsultants will have expertise in (i) water policy/institutions and team leadership, (ii) natural \nresource and development economics, and (iii) disaster management. The World Bank has \nselected  and  mobilized  an  international  irrigation  specialist  (5  person-months),  who  has \ncommenced work on the Review and will report directly to the team leader when the consultants \nare fielded. The national consultants will include a deputy team leader with expertise in water \nresources. Other national consultants will have expertise in (i) water resources, (ii) groundwater, \n(iii)  water  quality,  (iv)  rural  sociology,  (v)  disaster  management,  (vi)  industrial  water \nmanagement, (vii) economics, (viii) environment, (ix) energy, (x) river navigation, (xi) water \nsupply and sanitation, (xii) Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and data management, and \n(xii) monitoring and evaluation. \n \n                                                 \n1  The SEDP identifies eight broad tasks: (i) develop human resources, infrastructure, and services for productivity \nand competitiveness; (ii) move strongly toward a market economy, and develop market institutions; (iii) accelerate \ninternational economic integration to boost trade and inflows of capital and technology; (iv) develop science and \ntechnology,  reform  education  and  training,  and  improve  the  management  of  natural  resources  and  the \nenvironment; (v) build cultural foundations and significantly improve people\u2019s health; (vi) ensure social equity, \ncreate jobs and wealth, eliminate hunger, reduce poverty, and provide a social security system; (vii) continue to \nbuild a socialist state ruled by law, and reform public administration to reduce bureaucracy, corruption and waste, \nand harassment of the people; and (viii) strengthen national defense, security, and foreign relations. \n2  Participating  government  institutions  will  include  the  ministries  of  natural  resources  and  the  environment, \nagriculture and rural development, planning and investment, transport, industry, and construction; Institute for \nWater  Resources  Planning;  and  National  Water  Resources  Council.  Development  partners  include  Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement, Asian Development Bank, the embassies of Denmark and Sweden, Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation, Japan International Cooperation Agency, Royal Netherlands Embassy, United Nations \nChildren's  Fund  (UNICEF),  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  United  Nations  Food  and  Agricultural \nOrganization, and World Bank. Various nongovernment organizations will participate. \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n4.  It is expected that the Review will take place over 8 months from April to November \n2007. \n \nB.  Background \n5.  The last water resources sector review for Viet Nam was prepared in 1995. Since then, \nthe environment governing the sector has significantly changed. Of particular relevance are the \n(i) promulgation of the Water Resources Law in 1998; (ii) creation of the Ministry of Natural \nResources and Environment in 2002; (iii) introduction of a range of new laws and decrees on \nissues,  such  as  licensing  and  pollution  control;  and  (iv)  introduction  of  policies  related  to \ndecentralization and grassroots democracy. Over the last 5 years, Viet Nam\u2019s economic growth \nhas averaged more than 7% and overall poverty has been reduced from 58% in 1993 to 24% in \n2004. This has had a large impact on the demands for water and has brought environmental \nsustainability to the forefront of issues affecting water resources management.  \n \n6.  Viet Nam faces a number of challenges in the field of water resources management. In \nthe rural sector, many irrigation systems suffer from low efficiency, and their management by \nirrigation management companies is not cost-effective. Non-irrigation uses of water in rural \nproduction are widely neglected in development programs. Systematic challenges remain in the \nwater supply, sanitation, and health field despite recent reforms. Natural disasters are a concern \nin many parts of Viet Nam, with flash floods, landslides, and coastal erosion common in coastal \nareas.  Water  shortages  occur  frequently  during  the  dry  season,  and  saltwater  intrusion  is \nadvancing into coastal plains and delta areas, limiting opportunities for extraction of water for \nagricultural, domestic, and industrial uses. The high regional, seasonal, and annual variability of \nwater supply is likely to become more extreme because of climate change associated with \nglobal warming. Pollution of surface and groundwater is emerging as a problem in many river \nbasins because of population growth and rapid industrialization. \n \n7.  The water sector in Viet Nam is characterized by a fragmented policy and institutional \nframework, with a wide range of policies affecting the sector and a history of poor coordination \namong ministries such as the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Ministry of Natural \nResources  and  Environment,  Ministry  of  Construction,  and  Ministry  of  Health.  There  are \nparticular concerns over responsibilities for river basin planning and IWRM. Links to wider \nnational  poverty  reduction,  economic  development,  and  institutional  reform  policies  and \nprocesses (including decentralization, Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy, \nsocialization, and 5-year planning system) are also poorly developed, so the full developmental \nimpacts of water management are often not realized. \n \n8.  At the same time, the Government provides substantial investment funds for irrigation, \nflood protection, and hydropower development. National poverty reduction programs, such as \nProgram  135  and  the  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Program,  also  include  large \ninvestments  in  water  services.  There  have  been  a  number  of  reform  initiatives,  including \nestablishing river basin organizations, introduction of participatory irrigation management, and \ndevelopment of province-level water strategies. However, to date, these have been limited in \nscale and impact and are yet to be adopted nationwide. \n \n9.  Sustaining economic growth in Viet Nam will require continuing investment in the water \nsector. One of the central aims of the Review will be to provide systematic and coherent \njustification and direction for such investments. This will be achieved through assessment of \nexperience  and  analysis  of  future  options.  The  relationship  of  such  investments  to  wider \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \ndevelopment processes, and the policy and institutional changes needed to make investments \nmore effective, will also be examined. \n \nC.  Consultant Inputs and Time Planning \n10.  The Review will be implemented in four phases: \n \n(i)  An  inception  phase,  during  which  team  members  are  mobilized,  institutional \narrangements  are  consolidated,  and  a  more  detailed  methodology  and \nimplementation plan is prepared based on detailed consultations with relevant \nstakeholders. This phase will culminate in an inception report. \n(ii)  An assessment of the sector status, which will analyze the water balance in \nmajor basins and provinces as the basis for a review of current water use and \ntrends in terms of water quantity (river flows and groundwater), water quality, \nsocioeconomic conditions; water demands present and future; international water \nbasin considerations; environmental values and conditions; legal, policy, and \ninstitutional  arrangements  at  all  levels  (including  resources,  systems,  and \ncapacity); water management experiences from previous programs and projects; \nand a preliminary analysis of the economic significance of water at household \nand national levels. This assessment will be reviewed in a multi-stakeholder \nworkshop and consolidated into a sector status report. \n(iii)  The identification of key sector management and development issues and the \nconsideration of all feasible options to address these issues will be consolidated \ninto an issues and options report that will set out in a balanced manner the pros \nand cons of all the options considered. \n(iv)  Consultations on the issues and options report will enable identification of a \nconsolidated set of recommendations that will be reviewed in a multi-stakeholder \nworkshop and through direct consultations. The final recommendations will be \nintegrated into the review final report which will include a summary of the outputs \nfrom the earlier phases.
