INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the country program mission in 2010, the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic  (Lao  PDR)  confirmed  its  request for technical  assistance (TA) to  support the  capacity \ndevelopment of urban water supply regulation. On 27 April 2011 the chair of the Water Supply \nRegulatory Committee (WSRC) reaffirmed this request. An Asian Development Bank (ADB) TA fact-\nfinding mission visited Vientiane in the Lao PDR during 19\u201321 September 2011 and reached an \nunderstanding  with  the  government  on  the  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost estimates and financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The TA is in line \nwith  the  Lao  PDR  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  other  municipal  infrastructure  and  services \nassessment, strategy, and road map, and the Water Operational Plan. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.1 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Based on its population distribution, the Lao PDR is predominantly a rural country. In 2005 it \nhad a population of 5.62 million and an estimated population growth rate of 2.1%. By 2020 the \npopulation is expected to reach 7.26 million people.2 About 73% of the population lives in nearly \n12,000 small rural villages, with the remaining 27% in urban centers or towns. About 42% of the urban \npopulation lives in 140 small towns of 2,000\u201320,000 people, and only 10 urban centers have a \npopulation of more than 20,000 people, with an estimated 754,000 people in Vientiane Capital City. \nAccess to piped water supply is estimated at 45% in urban areas and around 21% in small towns. \nThese  urban  areas  are  relatively  small  with  low  population  densities;  hence,  they  have  not \nexperienced the range of problems that are associated with urbanization in other parts of Asia. \nHowever, the situation is changing as urban centers are increasingly linking rural areas to wider \neconomic markets, and improvement in urban centers is central to balanced regional socioeconomic \ndevelopment, poverty alleviation, and tourism development. \n3.  In the Lao PDR the urban water supply sector was decentralized to the provincial level in 1999 \nand consists of 16 provincial nam papas (water supply utilities [PNPs]) and Nam Papa Nakhone \nLuang (NPNL) in Vientiane Capital City.3 The utilities are state-owned water supply enterprises, which \nunder the Enterprise Law are required to perform as corporate entities. In recent times some water \nutilities have taken a number of steps to improve their operational efficiency and financial performance:  \n \n(i)  Out of 17 water utilities, four are implementing approved corporate plans.4  \n(ii)  Some water utilities have implemented a free connection policy during construction of \nwater supply systems to help attract new consumers and eliminate a monetary barrier to \naccess for many households, especially the poor. The average cost per connection is \n$150,  which  may  be  higher  post-construction.  The  connection  cost  is  essentially \namortized through the tariff.  \n(iii)  All 16 PNPs adjusted tariffs in 2008 in accordance with the recommendation of the \nWSRC of 3-year annual adjustments based on full cost-recovery principles.5 \n                                                \n1\n  The TA is listed as firm for 2011 in ADB. 2011.

Manila, and first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 October 2011.  \n2\n  Based on the 2005 population census, the Lao Statistics Bureau estimated a 2010 total population of 6.156 million people \nwith an annual population growth rate of 2.2%. Last accessed information online on 23 September 2011.

Annual Urban Water Sector Performance Report, 2009. Vientiane. \n ", "2   \n(iv)  Some PNPs are working with provincial governments to improve their arrears collection, \nespecially from government agencies. \n(v)  Some  PNPs  have  entered  into  a  memorandum  of  agreement  with  provincial \ngovernments. These concession-type contracts help to regulate the price and supply of \nwater at the local level (e.g., 24-hour continuous supply). \n4.   While water utilities are slowly transforming into profit-making corporatized business entities, \na stronger regulatory body and effective sector regulations are needed to help (i) monitor the price of \nsupplied water and quality of service, and (ii) consult with the public on the rationale for why a water \nenterprise needs to operate as a sustainable and efficient business. In addition, measures such as a \ntelecommunication-linked consumer complaints system can help PNPs manage consumer complaints \nbefore problems are elevated to the national level. Since 2009, the NPNL has established a call-in \nhotline in Vientiane Capital City to which customers can call and report a leak or register a complaint. \nSimilarly, meaningful consultations can help PNPs ensure consumers are fully informed (e.g., prior to \nannual tariff adjustments).  \n5.  Since  1999,  the  government  has  made  considerable  efforts  in  establishing  a  regulatory \nenvironment. In 2008 the WSRC (and its secretariat, the Water Supply Regulatory Office [WASRO]) \nwas established,6 and became operational with its first meeting in March 2009. Since then it has held \nbiannual meetings. The WSRC consists of 10 members (two of them women), including government \nofficials and representatives from industry and consumers. There are 13 WASRO staff (23% of them \nwomen). Prior to 1999, the government prepared key financial, management, technical, and regulatory \naccounting guidelines; facilitated private sector water supply initiatives; carried out 3-year tariff reviews \nin 2004 and 2007; and published regular annual performance reports, which include regulatory reporting \nand  comparisons  over  time  of  public  accountability  performance.  However,  a  number  of  these \nguidelines still remain in draft form and require a review based on the 2009 Water Supply Law and its \nimplementation  decree  (forthcoming).  The  potential  impact  of  these  regulations  on  the  business \nenvironment in the sector in accordance with the 2005 Enterprise Law and 2009 Law on Investment \nPromotion is also not fully understood. Through TA 7612,7 ADB is helping to support regulatory impact \nassessment (RIA)\u2014a systematic appraisal of costs and benefits associated with a proposed new \nregulation and evaluation of the performance of existing regulations.8 \n6.  The current support for state-owned enterprise reform and growing support for private sector \nparticipation in the Lao PDR requires that the interests of both the consumer and operator (public or \nprivate) are protected and managed. The existence of a national regulator and rules for determining \ntariffs is helpful as it promotes predictability and consistency in the investment environment, primarily \nwith regard to tariffs and water quality. In 2008, ADB technical assistance found that informal small \nproviders or cooperatives operate piped water systems with individual house connections in 30% of \nsmall urban centers. These informal systems usually supply untreated water to villages at low pressure \nin areas not serviced by PNPs. In 2010, financing support from the ADB Water Financing Partnership \nFacility helped to complete a rapid assessment on the sector readiness for public\u2013private partnerships \n(PPPs). The assessment found that, while the urban water supply sector in the Lao PDR is not fully \nready to implement PPP projects on a large scale, it has in place the basic framework required for \ninitiating the process of engaging with the private sector. Small-scale PPP projects have been supported \nby Mini-Reseaux d\u2019Eau Potable (MIREP)9 and the United Nations Human Settlements Programme. The \n                                                \n6  Prime Minister's Decree No. 191/PM, dated 1 July 2005 on Regulation of Urban Water Supply Operations, and MPWT \nDecision No. 13265/MPWT, dated 22 October 2008 on the establishment of the WSRC. \n7  ADB. 2010.

The TA will support the government to strengthen its capacity in sector regulation. Water utilities, \nas corporate entities, are beginning to change their corporate structures to operate more efficiently \nunder the Enterprise Law. They are likely to adjust tariffs to match the cost of supplying clean and \ndrinkable water. The WSRC, as an autonomous institution, is new and further awareness raising is still \nneeded. In addition, private sector interest in urban water supply has increased over the past few years, \nwith joint-stock venture groups established in Vientiane and Savannakhet provinces for providing bulk \nwater supply to water utilities and small-scale private operators interested in cooperating with PNPs to \nexpand access to piped water supply. As such, a strong and knowledgeable regulatory body is needed \nwith the capacity to (i) advise water utilities on joint-stock venture contracts for bulk supply and/or \nconcession contracts with small-scale private investors for extension of distribution systems; (ii) monitor \nthe performance of public water utilities and private water operators in urban areas; (iii) ensure urban \nresidents receive quality, reliable, and affordable water supply; and (iv) enforce sector regulations and \nstandards.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The expected impact of the TA will be improved regulation in the urban water supply sector in \nthe Lao PDR. The expected outcome of the TA will be strengthened institutional capacity of agencies \nin urban water supply regulation in the Lao PDR. The proposed TA will complement existing efforts in \nstrengthening the regulatory environment,10 and will take into consideration recommendations from \npast technical assistance and recent reviews.11  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Output 1: Sector regulations for improved water operator performance. The WSRC has \napproved few regulatory documents and guidelines since its establishment in 2008. It approved the \nGuidelines on Service Performance Targets for Water Suppliers and Regulatory Monitoring of Service \nLevels in June 2010. A majority of guidelines covering economic and technical regulation remain in \ndraft. An indicative list of draft regulations and guidelines for review under the TA is provided in \nAppendix 2. The TA will help strengthen the capacity of the WSRC (and WASRO) to appraise draft \nregulations and evaluate approved regulatory documents using the RIA tools. Part of the RIA process \nincludes  seeking  feedback  from  key  stakeholders  who  will  be  affected  (e.g.,  water  utilities  and \ncommunities).  \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2009.

Output  2:  Improved  accountability  of  provincial  nam  papas. Reports on annual sector \nperformance  and  performance  audits  of  water  utilities  help  to  support  greater  accountability  and \ntransparency in the sector. Performance audits will help identify specific areas for improvement of \nPNPs, and these can be incorporated into corporate plans as proposed actions. The government has \ngenerated an annual urban water sector performance report since 2002. Since it was established, the \nWSRC has published reports in 2008 and 2009, with the 2010 report expected in October 2011. The \nfirst performance audit of nine PNPs was also completed in July 2008.12 The TA will assist the WSRC \n(and WASRO) conduct a performance audit of 16 PNPs and will coordinate with other development \npartners on a performance audit for NPNL. The audits will be done in three phases: (i) four PNPs that \nhave engaged in the corporatization process since 2008, of which two (Luang Prabang and Oudomxai) \nwere the subject of the initial exercise in 2008; (ii) the remaining seven of nine PNPs that were subject \nof the initial exercise in 2008; and (iii) the remaining five PNPs that were not included in the initial \nexercise. Simultaneously, WSRC (and WASRO) will also coordinate with other development partners on \nthe performance audit of NPNL. \n11.  Output 3: Enhanced sector regulations for private sector participation. To attract private \ninvestment it is important to identify the private sector needs and translate them into effective sector \nregulation. The TA will review current potential for private sector interest in urban water supply and \nsupport a demonstration pilot to illustrate how a PPP13 can be prepared and implemented. Activities \nunder this output will be implemented with the Department of Housing and Urban Planning (DHUP) in \nthe Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) and coordinated with the ongoing ADB Small \nTowns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project.14 \n12.  Output 4: Improved customer complaints procedures and relations. There is an opportunity \nfor water utilities to work with communities to ensure high-quality service is provided at an affordable \nprice. Local initiatives can support improved consumer and operator relations, thereby keeping the \nnumber of potential consumer complaints low. The TA will help strengthen the customer complaints \nprocedures of water utilities through a pilot demonstration of a telecommunication-linked customer \nservice system. A review of the existing draft procedures, together with the experiences from the pilot, \nwill help in finalizing the WSRC\u2019s guidelines on customer complaints procedures and relations.  \n13.  The  TA  is  based  on  the  following  assumptions:  (i)  the  government  remains  committed  to \nimprovements in governance issues in urban water supply, (ii) data from PNPs are reliable and accurate, \n(iii)  other  development  partners  continue  to  support  the  NPNL  in  corporate  planning,  (iv)  key \nstakeholders remain engaged in TA implementation, and (v) TA implementation will be coordinated with \nongoing ADB water supply projects. The key risk for the TA is if the WSRC is unable to maintain its \nmandate and autonomous status. This risk is being mitigated through the TA itself, which would lead to \ngreater self-awareness, and with its strong links with ADB\u2019s TA for Support for Post-Private Sector and \nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program Partnership Framework, and the Small \nTowns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. The TA will not have any safeguard issues or risks. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The government has requested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent which will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, air-conditioned office and work space (no office \nfurniture), secretarial assistance, local transport to site visits, standard internet access, and workshop \nand training facilities. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n                                                \n12  Attapeu, Bokeo, Champassak, Huaphan, Khammuan, Luang Prabang, Oudomxay, Saravan, and Xiengkhuang. \n13  PPPs are also referred to as public business participation including private sector. \n14 ADB. 2009.

The TA will be implemented for a period of 12 months (1 December 2011 to November 2012). \nThe MPWT\u2014specifically the WSRC\u2014will be the executing agency. The TA will work with the WASRO \nand DHUP, specifically the water supply division and the project coordination unit (PCU) for the Small \nTowns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. The TA will use the project steering committee of \nthe Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project to help coordinate discussions on sector \nregulation. The WASRO, together with the TA consultants, will also share a summary progress report \nwith WSRC members during each biannual meeting in March and October. Other key implementing \npartners  will  include  village  water  supply  and  sanitation  units  and  PNPs.  Participation  in  regional \nmeetings on regulatory aspects and/or exchanges with other regulatory groups in Southeast Asia will \nrequire  prior  approval  from  ADB,  with  endorsement  from  the  WSRC  chair.15 The  location  of  the \ndemonstration pilot activities (outputs 3 and 4) will be agreed upon between ADB and the MPWT during \nTA implementation.  \n16.  ADB will be responsible for the recruitment of consultants, in consultation with the MPWT, and \nfor overall TA management. Consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). TA implementation support will include \nconsulting services of 16 person-months of international consultant services (four consultants) and 12 \nperson-months of national consultant services (one consultant). The consultants will work directly with \nWSRC members, WASRO, and other MPWT staff. They will be engaged as individuals due to the \ndifferent specializations required by the TA. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. TA \nconsultants recruited to help support outputs 1 and 2 will work directly with the WASRO; those for \noutputs 3 and 4 will work with the WASRO, DHUP, and interested PNPs. TA consultants will also assist \nthe MPWT in procuring office equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as \namended from time to time). All equipment procured will be handed over to the MPWT at the end of the \nTA. Goods will be procured using shopping procedure, as packages are expected to be less than \n$100,000 equivalent. TA consultants will also administer the costs for workshops, training, seminars, \nand  surveys.  TA  disbursements  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n17.  The attached design and monitoring framework will be used to monitor the TA. Progress reports \nand knowledge products are part of each consultant\u2019s terms of reference. The TA completion report will \nsummarize the key achievements, and knowledge products will help disseminate good practices and \nlessons. The draft final regulations and final regulations will be translated into both Lao and English. \nRevised guidelines and policies will be applied to the sector.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the provision \nof technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to the Government \nof the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Strengthening Urban Water Supply Regulation, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n15 The WSRC chair will submit the nomination of the person to ADB with the required information (e.g., letter of invitation, \nmeeting or visit agenda, estimated cost details, expected outcome). The participant will be asked to submit a report at the \nend of the visit or meeting to the WSRC chair and ADB. The individual will be asked to make a presentation on the \noutcomes at the next WSRC and project steering committee meeting for the Small Towns Water Supply and Sanitation \nSector Project. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nAssumptions and Risks  \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved regulation in  Public and private opinion  Findings from a pre- and  Government remains \nthe urban water supply  about the sector regulator is  post-technical assistance  committed to \nsector in Lao PDR  improved in the categories of  questionnaire  improvements in \nneutrality, efficiency,  governance issues in \nAnnual urban water sector \naccountability, and  urban water supply  \nperformance reports \ntransparency \nRisk \nWSRC and its secretariat \n(WASRO) are unable to \nremain autonomous  \nOutcome  By 2012:    Assumptions \nStrengthened  Annual urban water sector  Annual urban water sector  Data from provincial nam \ninstitutional capacity of  performance reports show  performance reports from  papas is reliable and \nagencies in urban water  improvements in the sector  2003 to 2011  accurate  \nsupply regulation in Lao \nNumber of consumer  Provincial nam papa (PNP)  Annual urban water supply \nPDR \ncomplaints reported to WSRC  audit reports  performance reports for \n(or WASRO) decreases by  2010 and 2011 will be \nConsumer complaints \n50%   completed by October \nregistrar \n2011 and October 2012 \n \nThere are no safeguard \nrisks \nTA implementation will be \ncoordinated with ongoing \nADB water supply projects \nRisk \nWSRC is unable to \nmaintain its clear mandate \nand autonomous status, \nacquire adequate skills, \nand secure sufficient \nresources for daily \noperations \nOutputs      Assumptions  \n     \n1.
