INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help developing member \ncountries (DMCs) prepare for and respond to disasters by enhancing their understanding of \ndisaster displacement.1 To do so, the TA will (i) generate knowledge on disaster displacement, \nfocusing on characteristics, trends, and cost; and (ii) support selected DMCs to make evidence-\nbased decisions on preparing for, responding to, and managing displacement risks. A greater \nunderstanding of the dynamics of disaster displacement can reduce the socioeconomic impacts \nand long-term consequences disasters can have on development, particularly for the most \nvulnerable. \n \n2.  The TA is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030\u2019s operational \npriorities  on  tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability, and strengthening governance and institutional capacity.2 Under \nStrategy 2030, ADB will ensure a comprehensive approach to building disaster resilience. The \nTA is included in the 2019 and 2020 management-approved results-based work plan of the \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Natural hazards are inevitable. Although disaster risk reduction provides the most effective \napproach to preventing new disaster risks and reducing existing ones, residual risk remains. The \nincreasing  frequency  and  intensity  of  natural  hazards  across  Asia  and  the  Pacific  require \ngovernments and communities to have an evidence-based understanding of the disaster risk \nfaced and its potential implications. \n \n4.  Almost 75% of the world\u2019s disaster displacement in 2018 occurred in Asia and the Pacific. \nA recent modeling published in 2018 estimated that 240 of every 100,000 people across the \nregion  might  be  displaced  during  any  given  year  in  the  future,  not  including  preemptive \nevacuations. Floods will likely displace an estimated average of 11.5 million people each year in \nthe region, 87% of whom will be in urban areas.4 \n \n5.  Since the 1970s, ADB\u2019s DMCs have considerably reduced the mortality associated with \ndisasters, primarily because of improved early warning systems. Nevertheless, a person in Asia \nand the Pacific is still five times more likely to be affected by a disaster than someone living in \nother regions.5 While mortality is decreasing, the number of people adversely affected\u2014including \nby displacement\u2014and the cost of disasters are rising.6 This increasing trend, largely driven by \nthe  growing  concentration  of  people  and  assets  in  hazard-exposed  locations  and  an \n                                                \n1  Disaster displacement is defined by the Platform on Disaster Displacement as \u201csituations where people are forced \nto leave their homes or places of habitual residence as a result of a disaster or in order to avoid the impact of an \nimmediate and foreseeable natural hazard. Such displacement results from the fact that affected persons are (i) \nexposed to (ii) a natural hazard in a situation where (iii) they are too vulnerable and lack the resilience to withstand \nthe impacts of that hazard.\u201d Platform on Disaster Displacement.

The numbers of people displaced or at risk of displacement are generally known at a \nnational level, but gaps remain in understanding the multidimensional impacts of displacement, \nparticularly the gender, socioeconomic, and temporal (temporary, including seasonal, or longer-\nterm) dimensions; the current and expected long-term trends of displacement risk; the key triggers \nand drivers, including climate change, policy approaches, and practices to managing such \ndisplacement; and the financial costs. Displacement impacts development. It affects human and \nsocial capital, economic growth, poverty reduction, and environmental sustainability gains; it \nincreases fragility; and it disrupts lives. It can worsen vulnerabilities and create risks. During the \nresponse and recovery phases, certain groups\u2014such as women, children, older people, people \nwith  disabilities,  and  indigenous  communities\u2014can  face  additional  challenges  that  further \nmarginalize them. \n \n7.  Lack of understanding of the causes, scale, duration, and costs of displacement\u2014as well \nas  trends\u2014impedes  from  designing  and  implementing  appropriate  disaster  risk  reduction \nmeasures, including preparedness and response. Current research shows that sudden-onset \nnatural hazard events (such as flash floods or storms) tend to drive short-term displacement and \nslow-onset events (such as droughts) drive more permanent and longer-range migration; in \naddition, evidence shows that abrupt, short-range population movement\u2014and the demographic \nchanges that implies\u2014can indirectly influence longer-range migration.7 Many DMCs face multiple \ndisplacement triggers and need to enhance understanding to address displacement proactively \nwith improved linkages to spatial development, early warning, social protection, and risk transfer \nmeasures. To address this, preparedness and development planning must account for both \ndisaster and displacement risks, particularly because of projected urban growth and the likelihood \nthat much of this growth will take place in informal settlements, where disaster and displacement \nrisks are concentrated. \n \n8.  To enhance responses to disaster displacement, the international community agreed on \na series of targets and directions in global agendas. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk \nReduction, 2015\u20132030 calls for international and regional organizations to support efforts to build \nresilience and reduce displacement risk (priority 2), and for states to ensure rapid and effective \nresponse to disasters and related displacement (priority 3).8 The 2015 Paris Agreement on \nclimate change established a task force on displacement to provide policy recommendations on \nintegrated approaches to avert, minimize, and address displacement related to the adverse \neffects of climate change.9 A group of seven multilateral development banks, including ADB, \nestablished a platform to enhance and promote collaboration on economic migration and forced \ndisplacement to advance strategic dialogue and operational coordination and to maximize the \nimpact of their growing engagement in these two areas. In addition, the 2030 Agenda for \nSustainable Development (Sustainable Development Goal 10) and the global compacts on \nmigration and refugees all recognize the need for coordinated, cross-sector actions to address \ndiverse and region-specific human mobility challenges in the context of disaster displacement.10 \nTo realize these commitments, countries need further knowledge and analysis to enable informed \nand actionable policies and responses. \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2017.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: disaster resilience strengthened (footnote 8). \nThe TA will have the following outcome: preparedness for disaster displacement enhanced.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Knowledge of disaster displacement in Asia and the Pacific increased. \nBuilding on global analytical work, the TA will undertake research on disaster displacement in \nAsia and the Pacific, including an overview of trends and projections; an assessment of the \ntemporal (temporary, including seasonal, or longer-term) nature of displacement; modeling and \nquantifying the cost of disaster displacement risk; and related gender displacement analysis. The \nTA  will  identify  potential  policy  measures  and  best  practice  to  support  preparedness  and \nmanagement of displacement. \n \n11.  The research will downscale a global model on displacement to cover Asia and the \nPacific.12 This includes (i) supporting the production of time-series data and disaggregation by \ngender, age, disability, and other characteristics; and (ii) using extrapolation and correlation \nanalysis when required. The TA will conduct an economic impact assessment using disaster \ndisplacement data since 2008 and other relevant social and economic indicators to assess the \nrisk of disaster displacement and calibrate the model with historical data. The TA will publish and \nwidely disseminate the research digitally and make about 300 printed copies available at the high-\nlevel launch of the report. \n \n12.  Output 2: Decision-making in developing member countries at high risk of disaster \ndisplacement improved. The TA will develop detailed disaster displacement profiles for up to \nfour DMCs with some of the highest numbers and/or risk of disaster displacement to improve \nevidence-based decision-making, focusing on preparedness and managing displacement risks. \nIn close consultation with ADB\u2019s operational departments and prospective DMCs, the TA will \nselect DMCs within the first quarter of implementation, based on criteria to identify suitability, \nincluding the level of displacement risk and enabling environment factors. \n \n13.  The TA will develop the profiles in consultation with participating DMCs, drawing on \nnational data sets and accounting for country-specific drivers and downscaled global models on \ndisplacement risk. The profiles will (i) further elaborate disaster displacement risks at the country \nlevel by collecting, triangulating, and validating national data on displacement; and (ii) provide up-\nto-date contextual analysis. This will include a review of domestic policies and traditional practices \nand an economic analysis of the cost of displacement to the DMC\u2019s economy. The profiles will \nprovide the basis for national roundtable discussions on possible policy measures to address \ndisplacement costs, outlining further areas for research and/or programmatic responses. The TA \nwill make about 200 printed copies per DMC available to stakeholders. \n \n                                                \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n12 The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) applies a two-step approach based on data gathering and \nmodeling to estimate the number of people displaced by disasters. The methodology is a first step toward estimating \na global stock figure for disaster displacement and can be enhanced with additional and more representative data, \ntesting and validating it against observational data and employing more complex modeling methods. \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.  The  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change \nDepartment will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants, including resource persons; organize \nworkshops; and provide staff to act as resource persons in workshops. \n \n16.

ADB will engage consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or \nstaff instructions.13 ADB will engage the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC), which \nis part of the Norwegian Refugee Council, through single-source selection. IDMC was established \nin 1998 to provide high-quality data, analysis, and expertise on internal displacement to inform \npolicy and operational decisions that can reduce the risk of displacement and improve the lives \nof internally displaced people worldwide. Considered a global authoritative source of data and \nanalysis on internal displacement, IDMC offers rigorous, independent, and trusted services to the \ninternational community through its products and tools, including an annual global report on \ninternal displacement, a probabilistic model on disaster displacement risk metrics, thematic and \ncountry research, and satellite imagery analysis.14 \n \n18.  By engaging IDMC, ADB will harness the benefits of IDMC\u2019s proprietary displacement \nmodels, analysis, and data sets, as well as its recognized expertise and thought leadership in the \nfield.  IDMC\u2019s  experience  and  sustained  engagement  in  displacement  since  1998,  and  the \nresulting data sets and original research, offer an accessible and unique source of intellectual \nproperty. Its engagement represents a natural continuation of its global modeling and research \n(footnote 4), and its downstream regional and national application offers a clear advantage over \nother research institutes engaged in displacement and/or human mobility. \n                                                \n13 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n14 Output-based and/or lump-sum contracts will be considered for consulting services where appropriate, with the \nconcurrence of the Procurement, Portfolio and Financial Management Department. \n ", "5 \n \n19.
