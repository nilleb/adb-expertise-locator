INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program is a partnership of \neight countries and six multilateral institutions to promote development through cooperation. \nThe program focuses on energy, transport, trade facilitation, and trade policy, with work in each \narea led by a sector committee comprising country and multilateral institution representatives. \nThe proposed research and development technical assistance (TA) resulted from a series of \ndialogues in 2009 between the CAREC Energy Sector Coordinating Committee (ESCC), the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), and other multilateral institutions.1  \n2.  The TA was developed to identify national power sector deficiencies and resolve them \nby promoting interregional and intraregional electricity trade, improving energy security and \nenergy efficiency, and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases through optimized, integrated \ntransmission  and  generation  expansion.  The  TA  concept  was  endorsed  at  the  CAREC \nMinisterial Conference in October 2009, and initial concept clearance was approved by ADB in \nNovember 2009. The TA is part of the CAREC 2010 Energy Sector Action Plan.2  \n3.  At the March 2010 ESCC meeting, the country representatives reached, on behalf of \ntheir governments, agreement on TA impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \ncost,  and  financing  arrangements,  as  well  as  the  consultant's  terms  of  reference.  They \nrequested financing from ADB. This report reflects the agreements reached. The TA has been \nreviewed by ADB support departments and sector experts. The agreed design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The  Central  Asian  republics  (CARs)  of  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan enjoy abundant energy resources. However, the resources are \nnot distributed evenly, with Kazakhstan having large oil and coal reserves, Uzbekistan and \nTurkmenistan  sizeable  gas  reserves,  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  significant \nhydropower resources. This uneven distribution of resources means that regional cooperation is \nadvantageous, as each country can import and export the most appropriate energy form at the \nappropriate time to mutual advantage.  \n \n5.  During the Soviet era, the CARs energy system was designed to take advantage of \nregional variations. The CARs were connected to some extent by gas pipelines and to a lesser \nextent by oil pipelines. Through the 500 kilovolt (kV) power system, the thermal electrical power \nsystems of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan were connected with the hydropower \nsystems of Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, allowing Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic to \nexport power during the summer, when their hydropower generation was at a maximum, and \nimport power during the winter, when they were in energy deficit. Water releases in Tajikistan \nand the Kyrgyz Republic were coordinated with the overriding goal of meeting the irrigation \nneeds of downstream countries.  \n \n6.  Since 1990, the CARs have largely pursued energy self-sufficiency, with regional electric \ntrade plunging from 25 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 1990 to 4 GWh in 2008. This has resulted in \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 28 April 2010. \n2  CAREC. 2009. CAREC Energy Action Plan Framework. Endorsed by the 8th Ministerial Conference on Central Asia \nRegional  Economic  Cooperation.  http://www.carecinstitute.org/uploads/events/2009/8th-MC/Energy-Action-Plan-\nFramework.pdf. \n ", "2   \noccasional summer spillage in Tajikistan due to water storage limitations and winter energy \ndeficits in Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic. Low precipitation has caused winter energy \ndeficits to be more pronounced in recent years, especially in 2007 and 2008. That hydropower \nis required mainly in the winter and irrigation mainly in summer poses difficulties for optimum \nreservoir management and exchange of hydropower with fossil fuel power. The result is that \nsome  countries  generate  electricity  using  fossil  fuels  rather  than  import  from  neighboring \ncountries with surplus electricity generated from renewable resources.  \n \n7.  The December 2004 World Bank Regional Electricity Export Potential Study3 assessed \noptions for meeting future electricity demand in the CARs and the potential scope and location \nof  export  markets  outside  the  region.  The  key  findings  of  the  Regional  Electricity  Export \nPotential Study were that (i) annual domestic demand in the CARs can be met in the medium \nterm  through  loss  reduction,  rehabilitation  of  existing  generation  capacity,  and  strategic \ninvestment in new generation and transmission projects; and (ii) efforts should focus first on \ndeveloping intraregional trade, with interregional trade to follow. \n  \n8.  ADB's energy sector lending in the CARs initially focused on Tajikistan but is now \nexpanding  to  include  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Uzbekistan.  Existing  and  planned  projects \ninclude generation and transmission rehabilitation in Tajikistan, new generation in Uzbekistan, \nand  commercial  metering  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  In  Afghanistan,  ADB  is  financing  new \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution projects, with new connections between Afghanistan \nand Uzbekistan now allowing 100 megawatts of power to be delivered to Kabul with export \ncapacity to be increased to 300 megawatts in 2011. ADB is also financing the 300-megawatt \nTajikistan\u2013Afghanistan  connection  project  whereby  surplus  energy  from  Tajikistan  will  be \nexported to Afghanistan during the summer. Past regional initiatives have included the 2002 \nUzbekistan\u2013Tajikistan  transmission  modernization  project  and  the  Central  Asia  South  Asia \n(CASA) Regional Electricity Market initiative including the CASA-1000 Transmission Project to \nlink  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  to  Afghanistan  and  Pakistan.  The  transmission \nmodernization project did not proceed when the countries failed to conclude power purchase \nagreements. ADB's involvement in CASA-1000 was suspended following the 2009 financial \ncrisis, when the countries prioritized alternative emergency assistance. Development partners \nactive in the region include the World Bank, United States Agency for International Development, \nIslamic Development Bank, and European Union.  \n \n9.  Today,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Uzbekistan  continue  to  operate  an \ninterconnected power system with system operation and planning managed by the Coordinating \nDispatch Center (CDC) in Tashkent. Turkmenistan withdrew from the interconnected system in \n2003, but continues to export to CARs from islanded power plants. Afghanistan is in the process \nof joining the system and wishes to meet a portion of its demand with imports from CARs. \nCurrently, Tajikistan is disconnected from the system and operates in island mode. Trade is \ngenerally conducted bilaterally and is restricted by transmission constraints, low generation \ncapacity, and seasonal variation in demand.  \n \n10.  Regional  energy  trade  can  bring  financial  and  economic  benefits  to  participating \ncountries. However, countries must also address the competing need for energy security, which \nthe CARs have largely focused on over the past decade. As this is being addressed, the CARs \nare  now  considering  the  advantages  of  intraregional  and  interregional  trade.  Meanwhile, \nAfghanistan is actively developing regional import projects to help solve its severe generation \ndeficit. As reflected in the CAREC action plan, the four CARs of the Central Asian power system \n                                                 \n3 World Bank. 2004.

Washington, D.C. \n ", "  3\n(Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Tajikistan,  and  Uzbekistan)  and  Afghanistan  have  now \nconfirmed their wish to study the benefits from adopting a regional energy approach.  \n \n11.  The Energy Sector Action Plan agreed at the CAREC 2009 Ministerial Conference is \nstructured around three strategic issues: \n \n(i)  Energy demand and supply balance and infrastructure. This pillar addresses \nthe most efficient use of energy resources across the region to meet the needs of \nits people in a reliable, affordable, financially sustainable, and environmentally- \nsound manner. This approach considers factors such as climate change, the use \nof  renewable  energy  resources,  energy  efficiency  and  demand-side \nmanagement, intraregional and extra-regional trade opportunities, and least-cost \nplanning.  The  strategy  takes  into  consideration  seasonal  supply\u2013demand \nbalances  and  transmission  constraints.  This  theme  focuses  on  infrastructure \ninvestments. \n \n(ii)  Regional dispatch and regulatory development. This pillar addresses sector \nrestructuring, regulation, and contractual arrangements. It covers the policy and \ninstitutional needs to facilitate energy security, trade, and efficient transit across \nthe region. \n \n(iii)  Energy\u2013water  linkages.  Hydropower  brings  a  valuable  dimension  to  the \nregion\u2019s energy assets. The particular distribution of hydropower resources in \nCentral Asia raises complexities of transboundary water management. This pillar \ncalls for a strong analytical base to support the coordinated management of \nenergy and water resources. \n\u00a0\n12.  It was agreed that ADB would provide assistance in the infrastructure pillar, with other \ndevelopment partners providing assistance in the dispatch and energy\u2013water pillars.  \n  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact will be increased energy security and regional electricity trade to support \neconomic growth. Specific performance targets are being developed by the CAREC ESCC but \nwill include \n \n(i)  increased interregional and intraregional trade, \n(ii)  reduced winter electric deficits in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, and \n(iii)  increased exports from CARs to Afghanistan. \n \n14.  The outcome will be to identify a series of regional investment projects justified on \neconomic, financial, safeguard, and technical grounds to provide long-term solutions to balance \nelectricity demand and supply in the region. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA shall be executed over 12 months during which (i) a regional master plan will be \nproduced, and (ii) an analysis of the technical requirements for connecting Afghanistan with the \nCAR  power  system  will  be  prepared.  The  two  activities  will  be  conducted  in  parallel.  TA \n ", "4   \nconsultants will review the extensive series of related reports carried out over the past decade \nand assess the studies and investment projects currently planned or under execution. It will field \nmissions to the five countries to obtain data and meet with utility and government bodies. It will \nassess appropriate planning software and hardware to be procured. The planning software will \nbe installed, populated, and used to produce the master plan, with appropriate training provided. \nInterim and draft final reports will be presented to the working group. Regarding Afghanistan\u2019s \nconnection with the CAR power system, the consultants will work with the CDC, which will \ndefine the requirements for synchronous operation. The key activities are as follows:  \n \n(i)  Identify existing demand and 20-year growth projections for each country. \n(ii)  Assess the condition of existing generation and transmission assets. \n(iii)  Review and assess construction and rehabilitation projects currently planned.  \n(iv)  Identify alternatives including renewable energy options and the efficient use of \npower  including  load  management  and  other  demand-side  management \nmeasures.  Investigate  alternative  generation  scenarios  with  the  objective  of \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions. Define energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy priorities. \n(v)  Assess the adequacy of existing regional generation and transmission planning \nsoftware. Propose new software and hardware as appropriate. Identify, procure, \ninstall, and populate the new planning software. Train staff in its application. \n(vi)  Conduct  optimization  regionally,  considering environmental,  social,  economic, \nfinancial, technical, and security issues. \n(vii)  Assess the technical design of existing CAR system and analyze the technical \nand economic impacts caused by member(s) joining or withdrawing. \n(viii)  Analyze system technical requirements for Afghanistan\u2019s connection to the CAR \nsystem. \n(ix)  Identify the benefits of regionally optimized approach compared with planning on \na national basis. Quantify economic, financial, environmental, and social benefits, \nincluding those that reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.  \n(x)  Assess the adequacy of existing regional energy trading arrangements. Identify \ndeficiencies and propose remedies. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $2.5 million equivalent. It is proposed that ADB \nprovide $2 million on a grant basis, $1.5 million will be provided from the Regional Cooperation \nand  Integration  Fund  (RCIF)4 under  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Financing \nPartnership Facility and $500,000 will be provided from ADB's Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF\u2013IV). The governments will finance the remaining $500,000 equivalent through in-\nkind contributions from the government-owned utilities and the CDC. The TA cost estimates are \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency. An ESCC subcommittee will be created to oversee \nthe project. The subcommittee and ADB will direct, assist, and supervise the TA consultants. \nThe  subcommittee  and  ADB  will  meet  with  the  consultants  as  required  during  project \nimplementation but not fewer than 3 times to review inception, interim, and final reports.  \n \n                                                 \n4 Established by ADB. \n ", "  5\n18.  In each country, the consultants will work primarily with utilities and government bodies \nresponsible for planning.  \n \n19.  Utilities will provide office space and counterpart staff and make available appropriate \ndata and reports. The consultants will work with the CDC, which will also provide counterpart \nstaff and make available appropriate data and reports. \n \n20.  ADB will engage a firm of consultants or a consortium in accordance with its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) using quality- and cost-based \nselection  with  weighted  80:20  technical:financial  and  requiring  a  full  technical  proposal. \nDisbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook.5 Major equipment and software will be purchased in accordance with \nADB Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n21.  The TA will require eight international consultants for 42 person-months, and eight national \nconsultants for 60 person-months in the specialties of energy economics, financial analysis, \nsystem  planning,  power  generation,  power  transmission,  environment,  social  analysis  and \nenergy efficiency. The TA is expected to be completed by end of December 2011.  \n \n22.  The TA will be administered and monitored by ADB as part of the ongoing CAREC \nprogram. The consultants will design a project performance monitoring system and submit \nquarterly progress reports measuring performance against the project performance monitoring \nsystem. Interim and final reports will be presented at ESCC meetings to ensure compliance with \nthe terms of reference and the needs of participating countries. The TA will be evaluated \nthrough ADB's TA completion report procedures. \n \n23.\u00a0 The outputs of the TA will be a regional master plan and a technical study on connecting \nAfghanistan to the Central Asian power system. The master plan will include a set of investment \nprojects that will be an input into further developments of the Energy Sector Action Plan. The \nproposed  investments  will  be  endorsed  by  the  ESCC  as  projects  for  financing  and \nimplementation through the CAREC program. \u00a0\n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n24.

These terms of reference relate to the energy demand\u2013supply balance and infrastructure \npillar, as other technical assistance (TA) projects address the dispatch and energy\u2013water pillars.  \n \nB.  Overview of the Study \n \n3.  The  projects  identified  under  the  master  plan  will  increase  energy  security,  energy \nefficiency and trade by optimizing integrated transmission and generation expansion between \nAfghanistan and the four Central Asian republics (CARs) of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The study will address export opportunities from the five countries to \nneighboring regions. The master plan will study the integrated development of the regional \npower system and identify long-term solutions to balancing demand and supply, taking into \naccount current assets, demand projections, and trade opportunities. The study will address \npolicy measures to promote security and efficiency. It will also analyze technical requirements \nfor connecting Afghanistan with Central Asian power system (CAPS). \n \n4.  The study will be executed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) with Coordinating \nDispatch Center (CDC) as a counterpart agency. The study has been approved by the CAREC \nregional organization and endorsed by the ministers at the CAREC Ministerial Conference in \nOctober 2009. The Energy Sector Coordinating Committee of CAREC will review interim and \nfinal study outputs together with ADB.  \n \nC.  Consultants Tasks \n \n5.  ADB will recruit an international consulting firm or consortium of firms in line with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n \n \n6.  Since the 1900s a number of TA studies have been conducted on the performance of \nthe power sector in the five countries. The studies will be made available to the consultants in \nelectronic format for study and review. A number of these studies are available on the CAREC \nwebsite.  \n \n7.  It  is  planned  that  a  separate  Afghanistan  power  sector  master  plan  study  will  be \nconducted during 2011. The consultants conducting this Afghanistan study will forecast demand; \nassess  the  condition  of  existing  plants;  and  assess  alternatives  to  meet  forecast  demand \nincluding  new  domestic  generation  and  transmission  plants,  new  import  projects,  and  the \npossibility of export projects. The outputs of the Afghanistan master plan study will be an input \nto the regional master plan study. The consultants for the regional master plan will be required \nto coordinate with the consultants for the Afghanistan master plan.  \n \n8.  The consultants will be required to perform the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Identify existing demand, including unmet demand, and produce 20-year growth \ncountry projections for high, low, and base case growth scenarios. \n(ii)  Assess the condition of existing generation and transmission assets. Identify \nwhen they will reach the end of their economic life and need to be rehabilitated or \nretired.  \n(iii)  Review and assess construction and rehabilitation projects planned for individual \ncountries  and  regionally.  Confirm  the  need  for  these  projects  and  their \njustification  on  technical,  financial,  economic,  and  safeguard  grounds  while \nconsidering current and planned electric imports and exports. \n(iv)  Identify alternatives including renewable energy options and the efficient use of \npower  including  load  management  and  other  demand-side  management \nmeasures.  Investigate  alternative  generation  scenarios  with  the  objective  of \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions. Define energy efficiency and renewable \nenergy priorities. \n(v)  Assess  the  adequacy  of  existing  CDC  regional  generation  and  transmission \nplanning software. Propose new software and hardware as appropriate. Identify, \nprocure, install, and populate the new planning software. Train CDC staff in its \napplication. Run regional planning scenarios. \n(vi)  Review and assess planned country and regional projects. Propose new projects \nas  appropriate.  Prepare  a  regional  power  sector  master  plan  considering \nenvironmental, social, economic, financial, technical, and country security issues.  \n(vii)  Identify the benefits of a regional power sector plan compared with planning on a \nnational basis. Quantify economic, financial, environmental, and social benefits, \nincluding those resulting in reduced emission of greenhouse gases. Prepare a \n10-year investment plan for justified projects.  \n(viii)  Assess the adequacy of existing regional energy trading arrangements. Identify \ndeficiencies and propose remedies. \n(ix)  Assess the technical design of existing CAPS system. Analyze the technical and \neconomic impact caused by member(s) joining or withdrawing. \n(x)  Analyze system technical requirements for connecting Afghanistan to CAPS. \nConsider that Uzbekistan currently supplies islanded portions of the Afghanistan \nsystem  but  that  by  2012  the  Tajikistan  connection  with  Afghanistan  will  be \ncompleted, thereby potentially completing a parallel 220 kilovolt (kV) connection \nbetween Uzbekistan and Tajikistan through Afghanistan. Define technical actions \nrequired for Afghanistan to operate synchronously with CAPS. \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \n \nD.  Consultant Team \n9.  A team of eight international consultants is envisaged providing 42 person-months of \nservices. It will be assisted by eight national consultants providing 60 person-months.

Implementation Arrangements  \n10.  ADB will be the implementing agency. A working group of members from each country \nwill be created to oversee the project. The working group and the ADB project officer will direct, \nassist, and supervise the TA consultants. The working group and ADB project officer will meet \nwith the consultants as required during project implementation but no fewer than three times to \nreview inception, interim, and final reports.  \n \n11.  In  each  country  the  consultants  will  work  primarily  with  the  government  ministry \nresponsible for planning. The consultants will also work with the appropriate power utilities. The \ntransmission utilities (where unbundling has occurred) and vertically integrated utilities are in \nAfghanistan by Da Afhganistan Breshna Sherkat, Kazakhstan by Kazakhstan Electricity Grid \nOperating Company, Kyrgyz Republic by National Electric Grid of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan by \nBarki Tajik and Uzbekistan by Uzbekenergo. \n \n12.  The utility will provide office space and counterpart staff, as well as make available \nappropriate data and reports. The consultants will also work with the CDC, which will provide \ncounterpart staff and make available appropriate data and reports. \n \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \n \n13.  The consulting team will procure equipment to be financed under the TA in accordance \nwith ADB Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under \nthe TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.1 \nAll equipment purchased under the TA will be turned over to the CDC at the end of the TA.  \n \nF.
