THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nIndia for the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program (CARES Program), \nunder the countercyclical support facility COVID-19 pandemic response option (CPRO).1 The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Building Capacity for Improved \nImplementation of Government's COVID-19 Response and Pro-poor Economic Package, and if \nthe Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the TA. \n \n2.  Coronavirus  disease  2019  infection  is  increasing  rapidly  in  India.  The  first \ncoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case in India was reported on 30 January 2020 in Kerala. \nThe number remained low until mid-March but has increased rapidly since then. By 19 April 2020, \nIndia had reported 16,115 confirmed cases, 2,301 cured and discharged cases, and 519 deaths \nacross India.2 India faces serious shortage in medical staff and necessary facilities and equipment. \nAssuming the worst-case scenario of 2.2 million infected people, the existing intensive care unit \ncapacity of 57,000 beds will need to be doubled and all of them will have to be equipped with \nventilators.  \n \n3.  The large poor and vulnerable segment is facing high risk of infection and loss of \nincome. About 270 million people are living under the national poverty line and about 81 million \npeople live in densely populated urban areas, with limited access to health services and hygiene, \ncongested housing, and poor health-seeking behaviors.3 They face high risk of community \ntransmission. At the same time, the quarantine and social distancing measures have left many \nwithout a source of income. This would lead to as large a population as 104 million who are above \ninternational poverty line ($3.2/day) falling into poverty if consumption decreased by 10% due to \nCOVID-19 restrictions (para. 11). \n \n4.  India bracing for economic and fiscal shocks. International Monetary Fund (IMF) has \nslashed the FY2021 economic growth forecast for India to 1.9%, down by around 3.9 percentage \npoints over its January 2020 forecast.4 Depressed economic activity will disrupt the revenue \ntargets of Government of India. On the other hand, the government\u2019s COVID-19 response plan \nand other measures entail much higher public spending. Fiscal deficit is therefore likely to \nincrease significantly. The domestic borrowing plan is already significantly enhanced, which has \nraised  pressure  on  bond  yields.  High  domestic  borrowing  will  not  only  crowd  out  private \ninvestment, which is critical to post-pandemic recovery, but also increase future interest payments \non  public  debt.  Timely  and  low-cost  financial  assistances  in  convertible  currencies  from \ndevelopment partners will help alleviate the pressure on domestic financial conditions and support \nthe rupee as foreign capital flows out. \n \n5.  The proposed CARES Program. The government has identified COVID-19 containment, \nprevention and cure, and mitigating its adverse socio-economic consequences on the poor and \nvulnerable as the immediate priority. The CARES Program, under the CPRO of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), will provide critically needed support to help the government mitigate \nthe severe health, social, and economic impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is timely, relevant, \nand well-aligned with the government\u2019s phased approach. \n \n6.  India meets all of the access criteria of ADB\u2019s CPRO under the Countercyclical Support \nFacility,  which  include  adverse  impact  of  exogenous  shock,  countercyclical  development \nexpenditures, robust macroeconomic management, undertaking of key structural reforms, public \n \ndebt levels maintained at sustainable levels, and coordination with IMF (Table 1).5 The CARES \nProgram is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, including operational priorities on addressing \nremaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities,  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality, \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity, and fostering regional cooperation and \nintegration.6  \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria for COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option \nCPRO Access Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n1. Adverse impact of  IMF has slashed the FY2021 economic growth forecast to 1.9%, down by 3.9 \nexogenous shocks   percentage points from 5.8% in the January 2020 forecast. Recent ADB \nestimates  show  that  the  GDP  growth  could  fall  to  1.4%  under  longer \ncontainment with a projected 104 million people at risk to fall below $3.2/day \npoverty.7 Correspondingly, India\u2019s fiscal position is under stress. The gross \nfinancing  requirement  has  significantly  increased  due  to  the  crisis.  The \ngovernment\u2019s large domestic borrowing plan has already raised the yields on \ngovernment bonds and is likely to crowd out the private sector. The financial \nsector stress will also be pronounced against the backdrop of recent episodes \nof stressed balance sheets across some banks and non-banking financial \ninstitutions and given the cash flow problems faced by liquidity constrained \nMSMEs.  \n \n2. Countercyclical  The government\u2019s COVID-19 response program includes (i) a $2 billion health \ndevelopment  sector project to rapidly ramp up test-track-treatment capacity; and (ii) a $23 \nexpenditures  billion pro-poor relief package under PMGKY which will provide (a) additional \nsocial protection measures targeting the poor, vulnerable population, and \ndisadvantaged groups including women and (b) insurance coverage for all \ntypes of health workers engaged in the COVID-19 response. Significantly, \n65% of this package is in the form of direct social assistance and protection \nto the poor and vulnerable, including women. \n \nIn addition to this central government program, various state governments \nhave also initiated countercyclical measures. \n \n3. Pre-shock record  The fundamentals of the economy were strong pre-shock. India was the \nof generally sound  world\u2019s fastest growing large economy during 2014\u20132018 supported by sound \nmacroeconomic  macroeconomic management and economic development policies that have \nmanagement  contributed to substantial reduction in poverty.8 Public debt-to-GDP ratio has \ndeclined over the past decade while the government is putting serious efforts \non  fiscal  consolidation  under  the  Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Budget \nManagement Act, 2003, as amended in 2018.

The  government  has  rolled  out  a  series  of  structural  reforms, \nincluding introduction of goods and services tax, and lowering of corporate \ntaxes to boost investment and income tax reforms. India has adopted inflation \ntargeting in February 2015, which led consumer price index-based inflation to \nfall from a high of 12.3% in FY2010 to 4.8% in FY2020, within the inflation \ntargeting range of 2%-6%. 9 The pro-poor relief package is conducted within \na sound budgetary framework.   \n \n4. Structural reforms  The government has acted swiftly to contain the spread of COVID-19 and \nmitigate economic, social, and health impacts. The government has set up 11 \nEmpowered Groups to identify problem areas and ensure proper planning and \ncoordination across ministries for time-bound implementation of COVID-19 \nprograms.10 Further, a COVID-19 Economic Response Task Force has been \nset up under the leadership of the Finance Minister to undertake fiscal and \nmonetary measures in coordination with the RBI.  \n \n5. Debt sustainability  IMF Article IV consultations held in December 2019 assessed India\u2019s debt as \nlikely sustainable due to a favorable growth-interest rate differential (footnote \n9). The public debt to GDP ratio was 69.9% in FY2019 and 72.2% in FY2020.11 \nVarious stress tests to the ADB baseline show that the risks to India\u2019s debt \nsustainability remain contained. The additional borrowing under the ADB\u2019s \nCARES Program, proposed MSME finance project loan, and infrastructure \nfinance  project  loan  ($2  billion  combined),  the  World  Bank\u2019s  COVID-19 \nassistance ($2 billion combined), and $500 million each from AIIB and NDB \nwill increase the public debt to GDP ratio by about 0.2 percentage points from \nthe ADB baseline (77.2%) in the first two years, peaking in FY2022, and \ngradually converge to the baseline to be 0.1 percentage points higher by \nFY2025 as amortization increases.  \n \n6.

Rolling Updates on Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) (accessed on 29 March 2020). \n \n ", "4 \n2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, the People\u2019s Republic of China, the number of cases outside of \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China has grown exponentially from beginning of March 2020. The \nCOVID-19  infection  has  spread  to  213  countries,  areas,  or  territories,  reaching  2,074,529 \nconfirmed cases and 139,378 deaths within three months.13 \n \n8.  Rapid increase of COVID-19 in India. While the number of confirmed cases is increasing \nrapidly, India is still at the stage of clusters of cases where several occur in close proximity in \nterms of both time and geography.14 Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, \nand Tamil Nadu have more than 1,000 confirmed cases each while 20 states or union territories \nhave less than 50 cases. Like most countries around the world, India has been trying to contain \nCOVID-19 as much as possible to protect lives and avoid health system collapse by implementing \nsocial distancing, community quarantine, and testing and tracking. From the perspective of social \ndeterminants of health, a huge number of poor people living in urban slums are vulnerable to \nCOVID-19 in India (para. 3). India has more than 140 million inter- and intra-state migrant workers \nwho have been particularly affected. A great number of vulnerable people are at high risk of large \ncommunity transmission.   \n \n9.  Health system. While the government is committed to universal health coverage and has \nimplemented key health sector interventions such as the National Health Mission for the poor and \nvulnerable, public health expenditure in India remains at about 1% of gross domestic product \n(GDP). India continues to face persistent risk with communicable diseases accounting for 27.5% \nof all deaths.15 It also has a serious shortage of medical staff and necessary facilities and \nequipment, with 0.8 physician and 0.7 hospital bed per 1,000 people.16 It is estimated that a \nmaximum 57,000 beds in intensive care units are available, less than half of which (25,000) have \nventilators.17 Assuming the worst-case scenario of 2.2 million infected people,18 India would need \n110,000 intensive care units equipped with ventilators. The protection of health workers is equally \nimportant in the fight against COVID-19. Personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators \nalone would cost about $898 million according to the government\u2019s estimation of requirements.19  \n \n10.  Economic impact of the lockdown. Given the extremely high risks of the pandemic, \nparticularly for the lower income segment of the population, the Prime Minister on 24 March 2020 \nannounced a 21-day nationwide lockdown, which was later extended until 3 May 2020.20 While \nthe lockdown was necessary to curtail widespread transmission and to simultaneously address \nexisting  health  sector  weaknesses,  it  has  severely  depressed  economic  activity.

The national \nestimates show that 21.2% of the population lived below the national poverty line in FY2012.23 \nRecent estimates in 2018 shows that about 40.2% of the population or 544 million poor are living \nbelow international poverty line of $3.2/day and are vulnerable to sudden and prolonged income \nshocks that may drive them back into extreme poverty.24 Depending upon the length of the crisis \nand the severity of economic and social impacts, poverty simulations show that the number of \n$3.2/day poor could increase by up to 104 million compared with the scenario without COVID-19. \nWomen would be more impacted by the pandemic as they have a higher probability of exposure \nto COVID-19, being the primary caregivers to the family and taking up high proportion of frontline \nhealth workers (para. 43).  \n \n12.  Unemployment in the formal and informal sectors. About 68.4% of the workers are \nengaged in non-agricultural informal sector, and 54.8% of informal workers are women.25 With \nbusinesses disrupted, these are the first to lose their jobs which could easily push households \n \n22  The personal services under '\"Business, Trade, Personal, and Public Services\" pertain mostly to health care and \nsocial work activities while other personal services under \"Hotel and restaurants and other personal services\" relate \nto wellness and other services (e.g. haircut, laundry). \n23  Estimates are based on the national poverty line.

Among the regular wage or salaried employees in the non-agriculture \nsector, about 71.1% do not have a written job contract and 54.2% are not eligible for paid leave. \nNearly half of the employed workers are self-employed, 22.8% earn a regular wage or salary and \nthe remaining 24.9% are casual workers. A prolonged widespread lockdown and disruption to \neconomic activities make these people particularly vulnerable to the loss of jobs and livelihoods. \n \n13.  Elevated financial and corporate sector stress. Since the pandemic\u2019s international and \ndomestic spread, India\u2019s domestic financial conditions have tightened significantly with both stock \nprices  and  Indian  rupee  falling  sharply.  The  Bombay  Stock  Exchange\u2019s  main  index  (BSE \nSENSEX) has declined by 23.0% from 28 February to 31 March 2020, erasing more than \u20b933.4 \ntrillion ($445 billion) in market capitalization (Figure 1).26 Data from the National Securities \nDepository Limited show that foreign institutional investors pulled out more than \u20b91.2 trillion ($16 \nbillion) in March alone.27 The Indian rupee has depreciated by 5.9% from early January. Since \nearly March, yields on 10-year government bonds have risen by about 40 basis points (bps), \ndespite a reduction of 75 bps in the Repo Rate by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the central \nbank). As a result, the yield curve of government securities has steepened with the yield spread \nwidening by about 100 bps, indicating much tighter liquidity conditions (Figure 2). The rapid onset \nof the crisis makes it too early to accurately gauge increases in nonperforming loans against a \nbackdrop of recent episodes of stressed balance sheets across some banks and nonbanking \nfinancial companies. Based on a review of the aggregate loan portfolio composition of the entire \nbanking system, the banking sector reported lending concentrations in industry (31.3% of total \nloans), transport, tourism and hospitality (2.1%), wholesale and retail trade (6%), and commercial \nreal estate activities (2.6%) as at the end of February 2020.28 These exposures total \u20b937.5 trillion \n($500 billion) and represent 42% of total loans and about twice the systems\u2019 consolidated \ncapital\u2014a significant exposure. The corporate segment is also exposed to substantial risk.

Significant fiscal pressure. Before the pandemic struck, the central government had \ncommitted to a moderate path of fiscal consolidation in its FY2021 budget, lowering the fiscal \ndeficit from 3.8% of GDP in FY2020 to 3.5% of GDP in FY2021, and gradually to 3.1% in FY2023. \nThe gross tax to GDP ratio was projected to be stable at about 10.8% in FY2021, and 10.7% \nduring FY2022 and FY2023. The government\u2019s gross tax revenue was targeted to grow by 12.0% \nin  FY2021. 30  Disruptions  to  economic  activities  will  undermine  this  effort.  In  addition, \ndisinvestment targets may not be achieved in the difficult market environment. On the other hand, \nthe government\u2019s COVID-19 response plan and other measures entail increased public spending \non healthcare, social protection, and economic support. Fiscal stimulus may also be required \nduring FY2021 to support economic revival, further increasing the fiscal pressure.  \n \n15.  Phased approach. The government has taken pre-emptive, proactive and multisector \nmeasures to fight COVID-19 and mitigate its economic, social, and health impacts. It has adopted \na sequential approach to prioritize the containment, prevention and cure of COVID-19, while \nmitigating its adverse socioeconomic consequences on the poor and vulnerable. It will follow this \nup with other measures for economic revival as the lockdown is selectively lifted. The plan for \ngradual relaxation from lockdown includes minimum enforcement guidelines for opening up \nagricultural activities, manufacturing, logistics, and ecommerce.  \n \n16.  Declaration of COVID-19 as \u201cnotified disaster\u201d. On 14 March 2020, invoking powers \nunder the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, the disease was declared a notified disaster as the initial \nadministrative  step  to  enhance  preparedness  for  and  containment  of  the  virus\u2014including \nscreening  at  the  points  of  entry,  contact  tracing,  and  follow-up  of  confirmed  cases. 31 \nSimultaneously, state governments started taking response measures. The National Centre for \nDisease Control activated the Strategic Health Operations Centre to provide command and \ncontrol functions and opened a helpline to answer public queries. On 24 March 2020, the Ministry \nof Home Affairs issued an order under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, directing all central \nand state level to take effective measures for ensuring social distancing. The government \nconstituted 11 Empowered Groups of officers to identify problem areas and ensure proper \nplanning and time-bound implementation of the COVID-19 response. These intersectoral groups \nhave been active in resolving issues with critical supplies such as PPE by engaging  with \nmanufacturers and suppliers. India has been spearheading a joint South Asian Association for \nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) COVID-19 response strategy, under which India has pledged \n$10 million to a SAARC emergency fund. The plan also calls for India to work with its neighbors \nto implement joint surveillance measures.  \n \n17.  The Reserve Bank of India\u2019s quick response. In early March when financial markets \nbecame volatile due to the pandemic, RBI injected liquidity of \u20b92.8 trillion ($37 billion, 1.4% of \nGDP) through various instruments. On 27 March 2020, the RBI announced liquidity measures to \nthe tune of \u20b93.7 trillion (1.8% of GDP) across three measures in response to the pandemic: long-\nterm repo operations, a cash reserve ratio cut of 100 bps, and an increase in the marginal standing \nfacility to 3% of the statutory liquidity ratio. It cut its policy rate by 75 basis points to 4.4%, the \nlowest ever. All lending institutions will allow a 3-month moratorium on term loans and defer \ninterest payments on working capital (footnote 4). In March 2020, when Indian financial markets \njoined a global sell-off in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the RBI undertook open market \noperations and United States (US) dollar\u2013rupee swaps to ensure adequate Indian rupee and US \n \n30  Government of India. 2020.

On 17 April 2020, the RBI again announced a number of measures such as \nreduction in the reverse repo rate by 25 bps to 3.75%, refinancing facilities for All India Financial \nInstitutions,32 and targeted long-term repo operations for investments in nonbanking financial \ncompanies. \n \n18.  Public health response measures. The central technical agencies under the Ministry of \nHealth and Family Welfare (MOHFW), with the support of the World Health Organization (WHO) \nand other development partners, have issued guidelines on surveillance, testing, case tracking, \nquarantine, case management, health personnel, use of PPE, and management of dead bodies.33 \nThe  testing  regime  has  been  updated  thrice  and  more  testing  laboratories  are  becoming \naccredited (including private sector laboratories) incorporating the latest WHO advisory. The \ngovernment procured 1 million testing kits, and testing capacity rapidly increased to 18,000 by 6 \nApril 2020, through a network of 136 government and 56 private laboratories.34 The virus test will \nbe augmented by a rapid antibody-based blood test for COVID-19 as a strategy for areas reporting \ncluster infection and in large migration gatherings and evacuees centers.35 The states are \nimplementing the public health response to the pandemic under the National Health Mission, \nwhich has well established implementation arrangements. Critical trainings for health workers are \nbeing conducted. The government aims to add 100,000 isolation wards. About 20,000 train \ncoaches were converted to isolation wards and several stadiums are being converted to large \nscale isolation facilities in preparation for a case surge. More than 600 hospitals have been \ndesignated as dedicated COVID-19 care centers. The MOHFW has already disbursed \u20b9411 \nmillion to states and union territories for emergency response.36 Risk communications, such as \nmass texting advisories, have been carried out in conjunction with telecom providers to reach as \nwide a population as possible.  \n \n2.  The Government\u2019s COVID-19 Response Program  \n \n19.  Among the wide range of the government measures to address the pandemic impact, the \nCARES Program will focus on addressing the immediate needs of vulnerable groups for 3 months \nwhile stepping up the health sector response. The scope of the government\u2019s COVID-19 response \nprogram is summarized below, and detailed breakdown is in the linked documents.37  \n \n20.  A $2 billion COVID-19 containment plan. The Prime Minister announced the COVID-19 \nResponse and Health Systems Preparedness Project on 24 March. It includes a \u20b9150 billion ($2 \nbillion, or about 0.1% of GDP) package to (i) carry out emergency responses through the provision \nof PPE, enhanced surveillance, improved health facilities, training of health workers, testing and \ntracking for the containment of COVID-19; (ii) strengthen the national and state health systems to \nsupport prevention and preparedness; (iii) strengthen pandemic research; and (iv) enhance risk \n \n32  All India Financial Institutions include National Bank for Agriculture and Development, Small Industries Development \nBank of India, and the National Housing Bank. \n33  The technical agencies include National Centre for Disease Control, the Indian Council of Medical Research, and \nthe All India Institute of Medical Science. \n34  The government is using Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction for infection detection as advised by \nWHO.  \n35  Indian Council for Medical Research.

In addition to the urgent activities undertaken (para. 18), several actions have been \ncompleted to ensure effective implementation of the project (footnote 37). Key actions include: (i) \nthe Containment Plan for Large Outbreaks of COVID-19; (ii) Micro Plan for Containing Local \nTransmission of COVID-19; (iii) guidance for states on social distancing issued by MOHFW; (iv) \nguidelines for healthcare providers for safe and effective response to COVID-19; (v) guidelines or \nadvisories  for  states  on  migrant  worker  quarantines,  psychosocial  support,  and  grievance \nredressal while responding to COVID-19; and (vi) a dedicated page for COVID-19 related \ncategories on the government\u2019 e-Marketplace for faster procurement of COVID-19 related items.  \n \n22.  A $23 billion pro-poor economic relief package. The Finance Minister announced the \nPrime Minister\u2019s Welfare Scheme for the Poor (PMGKY) on 26 March 2020, which includes a \n\u20b91.7 trillion ($23 billion or about 0.8% of GDP) package to provide immediate social security \nbenefits to the poor, vulnerable and disadvantaged groups including women affected due to the \nlockdown. It consists of (i) providing free health insurance for all levels of health workers and \nproviding funds for health-related expenditures (estimated at $3.3 billion); (ii) measures to provide \nsocial assistance for compensating economic loss to vulnerable populations, including cash \ntransfers to farmers, women, senior citizens, and people with disabilities, and free food and gas \ndistribution for the poor (estimated at $15.0 billion);39 and (iii) social security measures for affected \nworkers in both the formal and informal sectors, including the government\u2019s contribution to the \nemployers\u2019 share of contributions to the Employees\u2019 Provident Fund for 3 months benefiting small \nbusinesses, and allowing employees to withdraw up to 75% of their Employees\u2019 Provident Fund \nbalance or 3-month salary whichever is less (estimated at $4.8 billion).  \n \n3.  Macroeconomic Management and Debt Sustainability  \n \n23.  Sound macroeconomic management. India\u2019s macroeconomic framework is broadly \nstrong with robust performance before the shock. India\u2019 annual GDP growth averaged 7.0% over \nFY2010\u2013FY2019. It was the world\u2019s fastest growing large economy during 2014-2018 supported \nby  sound  macroeconomic  management  and  economic  development  policies  that  have \ncontributed to substantial reduction in poverty. Significant reforms have been undertaken for \nimproved accountability and transparency, public service delivery, social and financial inclusion, \n100%  rural  electrification,  ambitious  infrastructure  development,  and  improving  business \nenvironment. India\u2019s place in the World Bank\u2019s ease of doing business ranking has improved from \n \n38  The World Bank will support this project with $1 billion under its COVID-19 Strategic Preparedness and Response \nProject approved in April 2020.  \n39  The pro-poor program will provide additional benefits to existing beneficiaries which are registered under each sub-\nprogram. These are categorized as the economically weakest section of the population and are most affected. The \nprogram will provide additional amount on top of the existing benefits. The attached TA will support the government \nin identifying COVID-19 induced new beneficiaries which comprises of economically vulnerable section of the \npopulation. \n \n ", "10 \n130 in 2016 to 63 in 2019.  Savings and investment rates have been strong, and inflation has \nbeen declining. Consumer price index-based inflation decreased from 12% in FY2010 to 4.7% in \nFY2020 and was within the RBI\u2019s target range of 2% to 6% during FY2015-FY2020.40 India\u2019s \nmedium-term fiscal framework, the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM), \nhas been in place since 2003 and was amended in 2018 to set the central government target of \na fiscal deficit of 3.0% of GDP by FY2020 and a debt to-GDP ratio of 40% by FY2024.41 Apart \nfrom  some  weaknesses  in  the  financial  sector  from  impaired  balance  sheets  and  recent \nweakening of the Indian rupee, the macroeconomic outlook before the pandemic shock was \npositive. \n \n24.  Debt sustainability. IMF Article IV consultations held in December 2019 assessed India\u2019s \ndebt as likely sustainable due a favorable growth-interest rate differential. The public debt to GDP \nratio was 72.2% in FY2020. ADB\u2019s own assessment indicates that the public debt-to-GDP ratio \nwill remain elevated at 77.2% in FY2021 and 77.4% in FY2022 but will fall gradually to 73.5% by \nFY2025. The debt path under the ADB baseline is about 8 percentage points above the IMF \nprojections from the Article IV report, because of not only the adverse impact of COVID-19 on \ngrowth and the general government primary balance but also the revisions to national account \ndata released in January 2020. Various stress tests to the ADB baseline show that the risks to \nIndia\u2019s debt sustainability remain contained. The additional borrowing under the ADB\u2019s CARES \nProgram, proposed MSME finance project loan, and infrastructure finance project loan ($2 billion \ncombined), the World Bank\u2019s COVID-19 assistance ($2 billion combined), and $500 million each \nfrom the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and New Development Bank (NDB) will \nincrease the public debt to GDP ratio by about 0.2 percentage points from the ADB baseline in \nthe first two years, peaking at 77.5% in FY2022, and gradually converge to the baseline to be 0.1 \npercentage points higher by FY2025 as amortization increases. \n \n25.  Coordination with the International Monetary Fund and other development partners. \nADB has closely coordinated with IMF to obtain its assessment of the macroeconomic situation \nand COVID-19 impact on the Indian economy, which has been received on 16 April 2020. ADB \nis in close contact with other development financing agencies, both bilateral and multilateral, to \ncoordinate and collaborate on respective pandemic crisis responses. ADB has consulted with the \nWorld Bank to align the attached TA with its under-process $1 billion PMGKY support program. \nADB has also consulted with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement (AFD), German development cooperation through KfW, and Japan International \nCooperation Agency (JICA) for complementing efforts (para. 35) The United States Center for \nDisease  Control  provided  grant  assistance  for  COVID-19  response.

The program will provide a fiscal stimulus and protect the \ngovernment's spending and poverty alleviation programs and objectives, and help the country \ncontinue with its longer-term development objectives. The outputs are: (i) COVID-19 response \nand  health  system  measures  implemented;  (ii)  measures  to  provide  social  assistance  for \ncompensating  the  economic  loss  to  vulnerable  groups  enhanced;  and  (iii)  social  security \nmeasures enhanced for affected workers in both the formal and informal sectors, such as \nconstruction workers. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB has been actively involved in policy dialogue on the economic \nimpact of and response to COVID-19 by joining meetings chaired by Department of Economic \nAffairs (DEA) and providing recommendations that enhanced the government response actions \nand leading to the specific request for ADB\u2019s Countercyclical Support Facility and other programs \nbeing prepared. As an immediate support to India, ADB has provided $500,000 grant for thermal \nscanners from its regional TA and supported successful e-learning modules for COVID-19 \ntrainings for health workers. 43,44  \n \n28.  During the policy dialogue and through consultations with relevant agencies and think-\ntanks, ADB has also identified areas to further strengthen the outreach and effectiveness of \nexisting programs under the health sector response and PMGKY (footnote 37). These will be \nexplored for further support under the attached TA during implementation (para. 38). More \nspecifically for the PMGKY, the TA will support the government in developing the operational \nframework  and  strengthening  the  efficiency  of  the  targeting,  delivery  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation of the health sector interventions and select schemes under the PMGKY. The TA will \nalso aim at building and/or strengthening monitoring and evaluation systems for the PMGKY at \nthe central level and technology platforms and/or digital systems for select sub-schemes, for \nefficient targeting of the existing beneficiaries and COVID-19 induced new beneficiaries. ADB \nmonitoring  will  include  enhanced focus  of the  program  on  poor  and  vulnerable  population \nincluding women, by ensuring that program results are disaggregated by gender equality and \nsocial inclusion indicators as agreed by the government. The TA will provide valuable insights \nand structured inputs to the program implementation, identify areas for improvement, and facilitate \nfurther policy dialogues with the government, helping other development partners who are \nproviding financing to PMGKY. Another ongoing ADB TA will support MOHFW in COVID-19 \nresponse and ensure lessons learned from COVID-19 response are incorporated in the upcoming \nhealth sector interventions.45  An existing regional TA will also support measures against COVID-\n19 in South Asian countries including India.46 The regional TA on COVID-19 will support high level \npolicy dialogues and possible operations focusing on preparedness of health systems against \nCOVID-19 and emerging infectious diseases in Asia and the Pacific, including India (footnote 43).  \n \n43  ADB. 2020.

Food, gas, and cash for the affected \nand vulnerable beneficiaries will help them endure the shocks induced by the lockdown. Support \nin these areas will help a quicker economic recovery when the lockdown is eased. Any further \nfiscal stimulus will be sub-optimal if these urgent concerns are not addressed. The numbers of \nbeneficiaries are detailed in the government\u2019s COVID-19 Response Program (footnote 37). \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n34.  As growth falters because of the impact of COVID-19, the government\u2019s fiscal position will \nworsen in FY2021 from the budgeted 3.5% of GDP. The financing requirement of the central \ngovernment is expected to reach $133.1 billion, with the financing gap caused by COVID-19 \nestimated at $25.9 billion.52 Like other countries, India may extend the lockdown to flatten the \ncurve.  This  will  create  tremendous  pressure  on  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  space  to  mitigate \nsocioeconomic fallout. The financing requirement is expected to increase drastically from April to \nSeptember 2020, while government revenues will decline (para. 14). The longer the lockdown, \nthe more difficult the recovery process. Therefore, the current financing requirement is deemed \nconservative. \n \n35.  The central government aims to borrow \u20b94.88 trillion ($65 billion) over the first 6 months \nof FY2021 (April to September) through dated domestic securities\u2014nearly 63% of its pre-COVID-\n19 annual borrowing plan.53 Since early March, yields on 10-year government bonds have risen \nwhile the yield spread between 10-year government bonds and 3-month treasury bills has \nwidened, indicating much tighter liquidity conditions (para. 13). Additional government borrowing \nwill put further pressure on long-term interest rates. This will not only crowd out private investment, \nwhich is critical to post-pandemic recovery, but also increase future interest payments on public \ndebt, which is more than 70% of GDP. Timely and low-cost financial assistance in convertible \ncurrencies from development partners will help alleviate the pressure on domestic financial \nconditions and support the Indian rupee, as foreign capital flows out. In recognition of these \nchallenges and the need for an immediate response to COVID-19 with a strong monitoring \nframework, the World Bank has sanctioned $1.0 billion while additional financing for around $4.0 \nbillion is under consideration by the World Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, New \nDevelopment Bank, and including  (i) ADB CARES Program, and (ii) ADB\u2019s additional support \nMSMEs\u2019  and  infrastructure  financing  (Table  3).  The  government  is  considering  additional \nfinancing from JICA, AFD, and KfW to ease pressure on the domestic markets. \n \nTable 3:  Urgent Financing Needs and Support for Fiscal Year 2021 ($ Billion) \nFinancing Requirement and Source  FY2021   FY2021  \n(before COVID-19)  (adjusted for COVID-19) \n \n52  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n53  NDTV Profit. 2020.

The government has requested two loans comprising (i) $500 million loan; and (ii) $1 \nbillion loan, both from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, to help finance the anticipated deficit from \nthe pandemic response and countercyclical support expenditure needs. The first loan will have a \n10-year term, including a grace period of 3 years and second loan will have a 5-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; both with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement.  For the first \nloan of $500 million, the average loan maturity using annuity method based on 30% discount \nfactor, is 7.82 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. For the second loan of $1 \nbillion, the average loan maturity using annuity method based on 30% discount factor, is 4.34 \nyears, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n37.  The DEA, under the Ministry of Finance, will be the executing agency for the CARES \nProgram. The implementing agencies include (i) Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public \nDistribution; (ii) Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer\u2019s Welfare; (iii) Ministry of Rural Development; \n(iv) Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas; (v) Ministry of Labour and Employment; (vi) MOHFW; \n(vii) Department of Financial Services; (viii) Department of Expenditure; and other line ministries \nand agencies as may become necessary to be included. The empowered interministerial group \nestablished under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 on economic and welfare measures, \nchaired  by  Secretary,  DEA  and  including  MOHFW,  will  oversee  the  CARES  Program \nimplementation, under the guidance of the COVID-19 Economic Response Task Force headed \nby the Finance Minister. Director (ADB), DEA will act as the program director. The DEA will submit \nto ADB monthly reports for the first 3 months and quarterly reports thereafter on expenditures \nmade from the central government budget to support the countercyclical measures.54 The DEA \nwill also provide quarterly progress reports on the health intervention indicators, with the inputs \nfrom MOHFW and other relevant agencies. The program implementation period is April 2020 to \nJune 2021. The full amount of $1.5 billion will be disbursed upon the loan effectiveness. The \nproceeds  of  the  CARES  Program  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed agreements between \nADB and the Borrower.  \n \n54  List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "15 \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n38.  To  support  the  effective  implementation  of  the  government\u2019s  COVID-19  Response \nProgram, ADB will provide grant-based transaction TA.55 The TA will support the government in \nmonitoring and evaluation, and in building the capacity of selected implementing agencies. Since \nthe government\u2019s pro-poor package is very large with a wide range of schemes implemented by \nmultiple implementing agencies, ADB\u2019s focus will be on specific schemes that are considered \nmost effective in reaching out to the poor and vulnerable to leverage the limited ADB resources. \nThe DEA will be the executing agency for the TA. The implementing agencies will be MOHFW \n(for output 4) and the Department of Financial Services, MOF and relevant agencies involved with \nPMGKY pro-poor programs implementation (for the rest of the outputs). The TA is estimated to \ncost $2 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF-Others). The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart \nstaff, office, administrative and logistics support and other in-kind contributions. The TA will be \nimplemented from April 2020 to April 2022. The TA outputs are (i) capacity and tools for the \nPMGKY pro-poor programs\u2019 efficient targeting and implementation developed; (ii) the capacity \nand systems of selected PMGKY implementing agencies in program monitoring and evaluation \nincreased;  (iii)  reforms  for  strengthening  economic  resilience  identified,  including  follow-on \nmacroeconomic  measures;  and  (iv)  the  health  system\u2019s  capacity  for  COVID-19  response \nstrengthened.  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n39.  Governance. The PFM system in India has (i) a well-organized and systematic approach \nto budget formulation; (ii) a high level of fiscal transparency; (iii) comprehensive recording and \nmanagement of cash balances, debt, and guarantees by the government; and (iv) timely external \naudits by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India.56 However, the 2010 Public Expenditure \nand Financial Accountability (PEFA) report as well as other assessments carried out for recent \nADB operations noted that strengthening is still required in some areas such as: (i) effectiveness \nof internal controls for non-salary expenditures, (ii) effectiveness of internal audit; and (iii) scope, \nnature and follow-up of and legislative scrutiny of external audit reports.57 Despite the mostly \nrobust country PFM systems and practices, ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2018\u2013\n2022, states that the project implementing entities\u2019 capacity to handle multidisciplinary tasks on \ninterdepartmental coordination and governance, in terms of compliance and enforcement in \nproject operations, are matters of potential concern.58 \n40.  To strengthen the PFM systems, the government has undertaken several reforms recently, \nincluding (i) rolling out a comprehensive PFM system for digitally monitoring fund flows to states \nand executing agencies; (ii) implementing direct benefit transfers and digitization of government \naccounts; (iii) implementing an expenditure management system; (iv) creating a Public Debt \nManagement Cell, to delink debt and cash management from monetary policy management; and \n \n55  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n56  According to the most recent available PEFA assessment conducted in 2010, India has relatively strong PFM \nsystems in place. The overall score for India (2.75) with a medium fiduciary risk, was relatively high in an \ninternational context, given that the worldwide average PEFA overall score for 57 countries was 2.33 and the \naverage for lower-middle-income economies was 2.41 in 2019. \n57  ADB. 2014.

A wide range of measures \nhave been undertaken for improving transparency. These include (i) Right to Information Act 2005, \n(ii) use of Jan Dhan\u2013Aadhaar\u2013Mobile trinity strategy, wherein Jan Dhan bank accounts, Aadhaar \ncards (biometric identification cards), and mobile numbers have been linked to provide direct \nbenefit  transfers  to  beneficiaries;  (iii)  digitization  of  a  wide  range  of  public  services;  (iv) \nstrengthening systems for allocating scarce resources through competitive auctions; (v) adoption \nof e-procurement system; and (vi) mandating the use of the government e-marketplace. The \nPrevention of Corruption Act 1988 (amended in 2013), the Benami Transactions (Prohibitions) \nAct, 1988 (amended in 2016), and the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act 2013 (amended in 2016), have \nbeen amended for more effective corruption control. \n \n41.  Given the constraints in internal controls in line ministries and state governments on \nexpenditure management, lack of effective internal audit units, and limited capacity to conduct \nemergency procurement in certain states and/or union territories, the program pre-mitigation \nfiduciary risks are considered moderate. As mitigating measures, (i) a strong daily monitoring \nsystem has been established under the PMGKY, (ii) the finance minister-led task force will \nundertake overall monitoring, and (iii) financial assistance will go through budgetary channels. \nOther development partners supporting the PMGKY will also provide monitoring and evaluation \noversight. Moreover, the Jan Dhan bank accounts opened for the poor and unbanked, and linked \nwith  biometric  identification,  will  be  used  under  the  program  for  direct  benefit  transfer  to \nbeneficiary  bank  accounts.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was \nexplained to and discussed with the government.  \n \n42.  Poverty and social. Although India\u2019s poverty rate declined significantly, from 45.3% in \nFY1994 to 21.9% in FY2012, poverty remains a concern (para. 11). In addition to the high \nvulnerability of the poor to public health risks such as COVID-19, the pandemic is likely to have \nfar-reaching impacts on labor market outcomes and working poverty in India (para. 12). India has \nmany workers in the informal sector, and inter- and intra-state migrant workers. Most do not have \naccess to pensions, sick leave, paid leave, or any kind of insurance. Many do not have bank \naccounts and rely on daily cash wages to meet their needs. Current lockdown measures in India, \nwhich are at the high end of the University of Oxford\u2019s COVID-19 Government Response \nStringency Index, have impacted these workers significantly\u2014leaving large numbers with no \nviable means of income and forcing many to return to rural areas.59 The program will reach out to \nmore than 800 million people for meeting essential needs, and minimize the adverse effects of \nthe COVID-19 crisis on the poor, especially those working in the informal economy, more than \nhalf of whom are women.  \n \n43.  Gender. The program is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. Pandemics are \nknown to worsen all inequalities. Despite progress in some areas since 2012, gender inequalities \nremain pervasive in India in terms of access to health, lower labor force participation, and time \npoverty because of dependency on traditional biomass fuel for cooking.60 Female health workers \nconstitute almost half of the qualified health workforce, accounting for 88.9% of nurses and \nmidwives.61 The government has also deployed accredited social health activists (ASHAs) for \ncommunity surveillance and monitoring of COVID-19. ASHAs are women from the community \nwho are trained to work as an interface between the community and the public health system. \n \n59  University of Oxford.

Safeguards. Following an assessment of outputs, the CARES Program is not expected \nto have adverse environmental or social safeguards impacts and will not trigger ADB\u2019s safeguards \npolicies. It is category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. No \ncategory A or B activities are envisaged.

Adverse impact  While the International Monetary Fund  (IMF) has slashed the fiscal year (FY)2021 \nof exogenous  economic growth forecast for India to 1.9%\u2013 down by more than 3.9 percentage \nshocks   points over its January 2020 forecast, recent ADB estimates show that the gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth could fall to 1.4% under longer containment with \na projected 104 million at risk to fall below $3.2/day poverty.1 Gross financing \nrequirement has significantly increased due to the crisis. Government\u2019s large \ndomestic borrowing is likely to crowd out the private sector and raise interest \ncosts. The financial sector stress will also be pronounced against the backdrop of \nrecent episodes of stressed balance sheets across some banks and non-banking \nfinancial  institutions  and  given  the  cash  flow  problems  faced  by  liquidity \nconstrained micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).  \n2. Countercyclical  The  government\u2019s coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) response program \ndevelopment  includes (i) a $23 billion pro-poor relief package under the Prime Minister\u2019s \nexpenditures  Welfare Scheme for the Poor (PMGKY) that includes social protection measures \ntargeting the poor, vulnerable population and disadvantaged groups including \nwomen. Significantly, 65% of this package is in the form of direct social assistance \nand protection to the poor, and vulnerable, including women; and (ii) a $2 billion \nhealth sector expenditure program has also been launched. \n \nIn addition to this, various state governments have also initiated countercyclical \nmeasures. \n3. Pre-shock record  The fundamentals of the economy have remained strong. India was among the \nof generally sound  fastest growing economies of the world with an average annual GDP growth rate \nmacroeconomic  of 7.0% during FY2010\u2013FY2019. Public debt to GDP ratio has declined over the \nmanagement  past decade while the government is putting serious efforts on fiscal deficit \ntargeting under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act 2003 \n(amended in 2018).  The government has rolled out a series of structural reforms, \nincluding introduction of goods and services tax, and lowering of corporate taxes \nto boost investment. Although issues related to stressed banking sector balance \nsheets remain, prompt action by the central bank has lowered macro-financial \nrisks from the banking sector. Government has consolidated public sector banks \nand injected substantial capital for their strengthening. Consumer price index \n(CPI)-based inflation has been within the target range of 4% to 6% during \nFY2015\u2013FY2020. Foreign exchange reserves are enough to finance about 12 \nmonths of imports. India\u2019s external position is largely consistent with fundamentals \nand desirable policy setting.2 The pro-poor relief package is conducted within a \nsound budgetary framework.  The other reforms undertaken are as follows: \n1.  Accountability and Transparency \na.  Right to Information Act, 2005 \nb.  Performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  to  monitor  the \nperformance of all government schemes \nc.  E-procurement reforms \n2.  Doing Business \na.

Structural reforms  The government has acted swiftly to contain the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate \neconomic, social, and health impact. The government has set up 11 Empowered \nGroups to identify problem areas and ensure proper planning and coordination \nacross ministries for time-bound implementation of COVID-19 programs.3 Further, \na  COVID-19  Economic  Response  Task  Force  has  been  set  up  under  the \nleadership of the Finance Minister to undertake fiscal and monetary measures in \ncoordination with the Reserve Bank of India. \n5. Debt sustainability  IMF Article IV consultations held in December 2019 assessed India\u2019s debt as likely \nsustainable  due  to  a  favorable  growth-interest  rate  differential.  ADB\u2019s  own \nassessment indicates that the public debt to GDP ratio will increase from 72.2% \nin FY2020 to 77.2% in FY2021, and further to 77.4% in FY2022 but will fall \ngradually to 73.5% by FY2025. The debt path under the ADB baseline is about 8 \npercentage points above the IMF projections from the Article IV report, because \nof  not  only  the  adverse  impact  of  COVID-19  on  growth  and  the  general \ngovernment primary balance but also the revisions to national account data \nreleased in January 2020. Various stress tests to the ADB baseline show that the \nrisks to India\u2019s debt sustainability remain contained. The additional borrowing \nunder the ADB\u2019s CARES Program, MSME finance project loan, and infrastructure \nfinance project loan ($2 billion), the World Bank\u2019s COVID-19 assistance ($2 billion \ncombined), and $500 million each from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank \nand New Development Bank will increase the public debt to GDP ratio by about \n0.2 percentage points from the ADB baseline in the first two years, peaking at \n77.5% in FY2022, and gradually converge to the baseline to be 0.1 percentage \npoints higher by FY2025 as amortization increases. \n \n6.
