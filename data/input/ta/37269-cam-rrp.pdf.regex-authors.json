The  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  permanent \nAssessment  adverse environmental impacts. Impacts during construction and \noperation  will  be  managed  through  the  environmental \nmanagement  plan.  The  summary  initial  environmental \nexamination is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  will  (i) rehabilitate  594  kilometers  (km)  of  existing \nrailway track and associated structures, passing loops, and spur \nlines; (ii) reconstruct 48 km of destroyed railway line to Thailand; \n(iii) construct direct railway access to the container terminal in the \nport  of  Sihanoukville;  (iv) restructure  the  railway  subsector; \n(v) assist  employees  made  redundant  because  of  the \nrestructuring; and (vi) provide consulting services and training for \nproject monitoring, engineering design, and supervision of civil \nworks. \n   \nRationale  The  railway  is  owned  and  operated  by  Royal  Railways  of \nCambodia (RRC), a state-owned enterprise that falls under the \nMinistry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT).  The  railway \nconsists of two lines: the Southern Line (254 km), which links the \ncapital,  Phnom  Penh,  with  the  country\u2019s  main  seaport  in \nSihanoukville, and the Northern Line (388 km), which links Phnom \nPenh with Battambang in northwestern Cambodia and Poipet on \nthe border with Thailand. At the border, the railway connects with \nthe railway in Thailand and from there continues to Malaysia and \nSingapore. The two railway lines run roughly parallel to two of the \ncountry\u2019s primary roads: National Roads 3 and 4 to Sihanoukville \nand National Road 5 to Poipet.  \n \nCambodia\u2019s  road  transport  system  is  inefficient  because  of \ninsufficient modal and route competition. Improving the sector\u2019s \nefficiency  requires  increasing  the  diversity  of  transport  so  that \nshippers  and  passengers  have  realistic  alternatives  to  existing \nroutes and modes of transport. Rail would be a highly competitive \noption, because its cost structure differs substantially from that of \ntransport by road and sea. The differences in cost structure would \nmake it difficult to establish and maintain cross-modal collusion \nbetween  road  and  rail  transport  operators. Geographically,  rail \nwould also be an efficient competitor because the railway runs \nparallel to the country\u2019s busiest highways, national roads 3, 4 and ", "iii   \n5, and serves two international connection points at the port of \nSihanoukville  and  at  Poipet  on  the  border  with  Thailand.  The \nrailway is also connected to the Mekong River via the port in \nPhnom Penh. These links would enable multimodal integration \nthat  could  form  the  basis  for  efficient  distribution  of  bulk \ncommodities  to  northeastern  and northwestern  Cambodia.  The \nscope  for  railway  traffic  is  substantial,  as  reflected  in  the \nrestructuring study\u2019s traffic forecast, which predicts that demand \nfor  railway  freight  traffic  will  grow  by  about  7%  per  year, \nsignificantly more than the expected economic growth of some \n5.5% per year. \n \nThe railway is in poor physical condition because of war damage \nand decades of neglect. The last 48 km of track toward the border \nwith Thailand were destroyed during the war. Railway traffic is \ndeclining because of the poor condition of track and equipment, \nwhich  renders  the  railway  increasingly  unreliable  and  slow, \nwhereas  the  competing  road  network  has  been  improved \nsubstantially over the past decade. The RRC\u2019s staff are underpaid \nand professional skills and staffing levels are deteriorating. As a \nresult, the railway is operating at a deficit. Neither the RRC nor the \nGovernment of Cambodia (the Government) have the resources \nrequired  to  turn  the  railway  around.  Without  the  Project,  the \nrailway could cease to operate within a decade. \n \nAccess to efficient railway services would substantially improve \nthe efficiency of Cambodia\u2019s transport system by enabling efficient \nand safe railway transport for heavy, bulky, and hazardous cargo, \nsuch as cement, containers, and fuel, which are currently carried \nby more expensive and less safe road haulage. The main benefits \nwould be (i) reduced cost of transport for heavy and bulky freight, \n(ii) reduced  road  maintenance  because  of  the  reduced  heavy \ntruck traffic, (iii) reduced road hazards because of the decrease in \nheavy traffic and the diversion of hazardous materials away from \ncrowded roads that pass through numerous densely populated \ntowns and villages, and (iv) efficient access to import and export \nmarkets via the Thai border in Poipet. \n \nAchieving  these  benefits  requires  rehabilitating  the  railway\u2019s \ninfrastructure,  reconstructing  the  destroyed  track  leading  to \nThailand,  and  restructuring  the  railway  by  establishing  a  new \npublic\u2013private partnership (PPP) railway operator to take over the \noperation and maintenance of the railway on a commercial basis. \nRestructuring  of  the  railway  and  the  provision  of  transaction \nadvisory services to establish the new PPP railway operator is \nongoing  with  advisory  technical  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). Selection of a PPP railway operator is \na condition for loan effectiveness. \n \nThe  Government  gives  high  priority  to  rehabilitating  and \nrestructuring  the  railway  as  a  way  to  (i) improve  Cambodia\u2019s ", "  iii\ninternational  connectivity  and  competitiveness,  and  (ii) reduce \nlosses in the public sector. \n \nCambodia\u2019s railway is a strategic element of the Greater Mekong \nSubregion  transport  sector  strategy\u2019s  southern  corridor,  which \nconnects Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The Project would \npave the way for the proposed construction of a new railway line \nbetween  Phnom  Penh  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  City  in  Viet  Nam.  If \nconstructed, this new line, together with the project line, would \ncomplete the Singapore\u2013Kunming railway link, which is a long-\nterm development priority for the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  Project  would  support  Cambodia\u2019s  economic  development \nand strengthen subregional integration by enabling cost-effective \nand  efficient  railway  transport  within  Cambodia  and  between \nCambodia and Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore. \n \nThe Project involves rehabilitating or reconstructing the railway \nand  reestablishing  the  railway  connection  with  Thailand.  The \nrailway is also being restructured and the rehabilitated railway will \nbe operated by a new, commercial railway operator. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The estimated project cost is $73.0 million equivalent, including \ntaxes and duties of $7.4 million equivalent.  \n   \nFinancing Plan   ($ million) \nSource  Total  %\nAsian Development Bank  42.0  57\nOPEC Fund for   \nInternational Developmenta  13.0  18\nGovernment of Malaysia (grant in kind) 2.8  4\nGovernment of Cambodia  15.2  21\n          Total  73.0  100\naAdministered by ADB. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n      \nLoan Amount and  A  loan  of  $42  million  equivalent  will  be  provided  from  ADB\u2019s \nLending Terms  Special  Funds  resources.

Once \nrehabilitation starts the RRC will be divested of operations and \nmaintenance responsibilities for the railway. In the absence of a \nspecialized agency to implement the Project, the MPWT will be \nthe implementing agency through a project implementation team \nthat has been set up within the MPWT to implement the project \npreparatory technical assistance for rehabilitation. The team is \nheaded by a project director and staffed with technical staff drawn \nfrom the RRC and the MPWT. The team will be expanded with \nadditional  technical  staff  as  required  to  undertake  project \nprocurement and implementation. ADB will provide the necessary \ntraining to the team\u2019s technical staff in relation to procurement and \nimplementation.  The  National  Committee  for  the  Singapore\u2013\nKunming Railway Project, which is a high-level committee whose \naim is to facilitate realization of the Singapore\u2013Kunming railway \nlink and is chaired by the deputy prime minister, will act as the \nsteering committee for the Project. \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services financed by the ADB and OFID loans will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines using \ninternational competitive bidding. The Government has requested \nthe use of advance action and retroactive financing to permit the \nexecution of preliminary works. \n   \nConsulting Services  The ADB loan will finance consulting services for construction \nsupervision,  quality  assurance,  environmental  supervision  and \nmonitoring, monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement plan, \nsocioeconomic  impact  assessment,  and  project  performance \nmonitoring.  The  international  and  national  consultants  will  be \nrecruited through a firm in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consulting Services. The Government has requested \nthe use of advance action and retroactive financing to permit early \nrecruitment of the supervision consultant. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The traffic forecast is based on projected economic growth using \nBeneficiaries  a  scenario  in  which  Cambodia  maintains  its  recent  pace  of \neconomic reform and modernization. The main sources of project \nbenefits  are  savings  from  the  diversion  of  heavy  freight  and \ncontainer  traffic  from  road  transport  to  more  economical  rail \ntransport, which include reduced costs of road maintenance and \nlowered costs of road accidents. In turn, these savings will reduce \nthe costs of providing imported inputs such as cement and fuel \nand  will  support  the  creation  of  new  jobs  and  other  income-\ngenerating opportunities in export industries, which will become \nmore competitive as a result of reduced transport costs.  \n \n ", "  v\nThe  Project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  is  estimated  at \n24.9% and the financial internal rate of return is estimated at \n10.2%,  higher  than  the  4.1%  real  weighted  average  cost  of \ncapital. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  is  not  expected  to  be  subject  to  any  significant \ntechnical, environmental, or social risks. The MPWT has proven \nexperience  and  has  performed  satisfactorily  in  implementing \ninternationally financed projects. The Project has been formulated \nto  reduce  potential  economic,  financial,  and  social  risks.  The \nfinancial and economic risks are associated with operation of the \nrailway, which will depend on the future level of traffic, the costs of \nconstruction, and the efficiency of future railway operations. The \neconomic risks are minimized by the establishment of a new PPP \nrailway operator that will realize the Project\u2019s benefits by providing \nrailway services on a commercial basis. To mitigate the financial \nrisks,  the  Government  will  establish  a  professionally  managed \ncommercial  property  developer  entity  to  mobilize  revenue  by \ndeveloping  railway  land  that  is  no  longer  needed  for  railway \noperations.  The  net  revenues  from  property  development  will \npreferentially  be  used  to  finance  the  railway\u2019s  public  service \nobligations, such as maintaining passenger traffic and developing \nthe railway. The social risks include resettlement, the possible \nspread of HIV/AIDS infection during construction, the possibility of \nhuman trafficking after project completion, and the retrenchment \nof  redundant  railway  staff  in  connection  with  restructuring. \nAppropriate mitigation measures are in place in the resettlement \nplan and the social safety protection program. \n ", "vii   ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Rehabilitation of \nthe  Railway  in  Cambodia  Project,  and  (ii)  the  proposed  administration  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  of  a  loan  to  be  provided  by  the  OPEC  Fund  for  International \nDevelopment (OFID) for the Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Cambodia\u2019s  transport  sector  comprises  road,  railway,  and  inland  water  transport; \ninternational sea traffic through the ports in Sihanoukville and Phnom Penh; and domestic and \ninternational air traffic centered on Cambodia\u2019s two international airports in Phnom Penh and \nSiem  Reap.  Much  of  the  country\u2019s  transport  infrastructure  was  destroyed  or  substantially \ndegraded during the war. Reestablishing the transport infrastructure has been a primary goal of \nthe Government for the past 15 years and has focused on (i) reconstructing the primary road \nnetwork,  which  has  now  been  substantially  completed;  (ii) modernizing  and  upgrading  the \ninternational airports in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, which has been largely undertaken by the \nprivate  sector;  and  (iii) rehabilitating  and  modernizing  the  ports  in  Phnom  Penh  and \nSihanoukville.  Railway  and  inland  water  transport  have  received  somewhat  less  attention. \nInland water transport is developing slowly, driven by the private sector, but operations are \nhampered by the lack of navigational aids and shore facilities. The railway has been declining \nbecause of insufficient maintenance and investment. Transport operations are run by the private \nsector except for the railway, which is owned and operated by Royal Railways of Cambodia \n(RRC), a state-owned enterprise that falls under the Ministry of Public Works and Transport \n(MPWT). Transport is relatively expensive because of (i) fuel taxes, which are a major source of \nGovernment  revenues;  (ii) poor  infrastructure,  which  increases  vehicle  operating  costs  and \nconstrains  access;  and  (iii) inefficiencies  and  market  failure.  The  sector  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 2. \n3.  Cambodia's transport system remains inefficient despite improved roads, ports, and \nairports, because the choice of routes and modes of transport is limited, which constrains the \nscope for optimizing logistics and enables the formation of cartels by transport providers and \ntransport infrastructure owners to exploit natural monopolies. The enabling environment for \nthese  market  failures  is  the  existence  of  physical  and  regulatory  barriers  that  reduce  the \ndiversity of routes and modes, often to a single realistic choice. This locks transport buyers into \npossibly inefficient or overpriced services1 because of the lack of an alternative. As a result, the \nstaple  commodities  on  which  the  poor  rely  are  typically  significantly  more  expensive  in \nCambodia than in neighboring countries and Cambodia\u2019s nascent export industries, primarily \ngarments and tourism, which are the prime generators of new jobs and foreign currency, are \nthreatened because their international competitiveness is being undermined by high transaction \ncosts. This constitutes a major constraint to economic growth and diminishes the scope for the \neconomy to diversify into new sectors such as agro and assembly industry. \n                                                 \n1  As an example of constrained choice, consider the movement of a 20-foot container from Bangkok to Phnom Penh. \nCurrently, ship transport through the port of Sihanoukville is the only realistic route. This costs $983 and the \njourney time is 11 days because no direct container route exists between Bangkok and Sihanoukville. The cost of \nsimilar transport by rail\u2014were this possible\u2014would be about $320 and the journey time would be about 13 hours \n(Canarail Consultants, Inc.. 2006. Restructuring the Railway in Cambodia: Traffic Forecast and Financial Analysis \nReport. Montreal, Canada. [p. 28]. ", "2 \n4.  Breaking down the barriers that hinder competition and efficiency requires increasing the \ndiversity of transport so that shippers have effective and realistic alternatives to existing routes \nand modes. Railway could be a highly competitive operator, because its cost structure differs \nsubstantially from that of road and sea transport. The differences in cost structure makes it \ndifficult to establish and maintain cross-modal collusion between road and railway transport \noperators. Geographically, Cambodia offers excellent scope for rail competition because (i) the \nrailway runs parallel to the country\u2019s busiest highways, national roads 3, 4 and 5; (ii) it has two \ninternational connection points, at the port of Sihanoukville and at Poipet on the border with \nThailand; and (iii) the railway is connected to the port in Phnom Penh, which would enable \nmultimodal integration of rail and inland water transport to allow for the efficient distribution of \nbulk commodities to northeastern and northwestern Cambodia. The scope for railway traffic is \nreflected in the restructuring study,2 which projects that demand for railway freight traffic will \ngrow by about 6.5% per year, which is well above expected economic growth of 5.0\u20135.5% per \nyear. \n5.  Cambodia\u2019s  railway  is  a  strategic  element  of  the  GMS  transport  sector  strategy\u2019s \nsouthern corridor,3 which links Cambodia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Construction of a proposed \nrailway line to Viet Nam is one of the Government\u2019s strategic goals, and the Project would help \npave the way for the proposed railway line between Phnom Penh and Ho Chi Minh City in Viet \nNam. If constructed, this new line, together with the Project line, would complete the railway \ncomponent of the GMS southern corridor, and at the same time would complete the Singapore\u2013\nKunming railway link (SKRL), a long-term development priority for the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations. \n6.  Efficient railway transport would improve subregional traffic and significantly reduce the \ncost of transport by offering cheaper alternatives and by providing competition to existing modes \nand  routes.  Railway  transport  would  also  reduce  road  maintenance  requirements  and  the \nincidence and severity of traffic accidents by diverting heavy and hazardous road haulage to the \nrailway, which is inherently safer. Finally, efficient rail operations would directly improve the \nGovernment\u2019s finances by reducing the railway\u2019s deficits. The Government recognizes these \nbenefits and gives high priority to rehabilitating and restructuring the railway as a means of \n(i) improving Cambodia\u2019s international connectivity and competitiveness, and (ii) reducing losses \nin the public sector. However, neither the RRC nor the Government has the resources required \nto implement such rehabilitation and restructuring. \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  The railway was severely damaged during the war, when temporary repairs kept it \nrunning.  Since  then,  little  has  been  expended  on  investment  and  maintenance.  ADB  has \nsupported emergency repairs on two occasions: repair of critically damaged railway sections \nand bridges and of 35 wagons under the Special Rehabilitation Assistance Project4 and repair \nof flood-damaged bridges and railway embankments under the Emergency Flood Rehabilitation \nProject.5 The World Bank has also supported the acquisition of wagons and the Government of \n                                                 \n2  Canarail Consultants, Inc., 2006.

Details  on  external \nassistance are in Appendix 3. The combined impact of war damage and more than three \ndecades of little or no maintenance and minimal investment have led to severe deterioration of \nthe railway. Maximum train speed is now 15 kilometers (km) per hour, compared with a design \nspeed of 70 km per hour on the Southern Line and 90 km per hour on the Northern Line. \nCurrent traffic is about 6 or 7 trains per day, compared with 37 trains in around 1969-1970. Even \nwith this modest level of traffic, there is an average of one derailment per week. Technical \nreview of the railway\u2019s infrastructure indicates that many bridges are in danger of collapse and \nindicates that collapse of bridges will make railway operations impossible within the current \ndecade. \n8.  In the 1990s, railway traffic grew rapidly, partly in response to improving security and \neconomic  growth,  and  partly  because  of  a  lack  of  viable  alternatives  to  railway  transport. \nRailway freight traffic peaked in 2002 at about 560,000 tons, but then fell to about 270,000 tons \nin 2005. Passenger traffic peaked in 1992, when the railway transported about 1.4 million \npassengers. Today, passenger traffic on the Southern Line has ceased and on the Northern \nLine  is  minimal,  serving  about  40,000  passengers  annually  by  means  of  a  single  weekly \ndeparture in each direction between Phnom Penh and Battambang. The decline in traffic is due \nto the combined impact of progressing physical deterioration of the railway, which renders it \nincreasingly unreliable and slow, and to increasing competition from road transporters operating \non an expanding network of good highways. The loss of freight traffic results in mounting \noperational losses for the railway that are absorbed by the Government. The passenger service \non the Northern Line is used primarily by passengers to and from isolated communities along a \nsection of the Northern Line that does not have reliable road access, and is therefore dependent \non the railway for transport. The Project foresees that minimal passenger services will continue \nas a public service obligation. \n9.  The issues and opportunities facing the railway were first identified in Loan 1824-CAM,6 \nwhich concluded (i) that access to efficient railway transport would be economically beneficial \nfor Cambodia, and (ii) that the railway could become commercially viable if rehabilitated. The \nreport recommended that the Government should quickly decide either to restore or to close the \nrailway to minimize its losses. Closure of the railway is, however, not an appealing option. \nPotential future benefits derived from railway operations would be irretrievably lost unless a new \nrailway  were  constructed  in  the  future,  which  would  be  extremely  costly  compared  with \nrehabilitating the existing railway, and would probably not be viable. Two small-scale technical \nassistance (TA) studies were launched (i) to assess the likely future demand for railway traffic \n(the transport study7), and (ii) to examine the possibilities for establishing commercially viable \nrailway operations (the business opportunity study8). The transport study confirmed sufficient \nfuture demand for railway transport to make rehabilitation of the railway economically and \nfinancially viable. The business opportunity study showed that future losses to the Government \ncould be eliminated if the railway were operated commercially. It also indicated that operation of \nthe railway and investment in rolling stock and terminals could be viable for the private sector if \nthe railway\u2019s infrastructure were rehabilitated using concessionary funds, as this could  not be \nfinanced by the private sector under commercial conditions, nor by the Government, nor by the \nrailway, because of the lack of resources. Thus the study recommended that private sector \ninvestment and management resources be mobilized by spinning off railway operations into a \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2002.

A major portion of external assistance to the Cambodian transport sector has come from \nADB, the governments of France and Japan, and the World Bank. ADB's assistance to the \nsector began in 1993 with the Special Rehabilitation Assistance Project (footnote 4), which \nincluded  rehabilitation  of  national  highways,  sections  of  the  railway  track,  and  the  port  of \nSihanoukville. In 2000, ADB provided a loan for the Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project \n(footnote 5), which rehabilitated sections of the national highway network that were damaged by \nthe 2000 floods, along with critical sections of track and embankments. France has provided \ngrant financing for new bridges, rehabilitation of railway tracks, and spare parts for locomotives. \nJapan's assistance has been for bridge reconstruction and road rehabilitation. The World Bank \nhas provided loans for rehabilitating roads and widening bridges and culverts. It has also \nprovided  TA  for  transport  sector  policy  and  strategy,  institutional  strengthening,  and  road \nmaintenance.  The  People's  Republic  of  China  has  provided  assistance  for  procuring  10 \nlocomotives.  Other  bilateral  sources  of  assistance  to  the  transport  sector  include  the \ngovernments  of  Australia,  Sweden,  and  Thailand.  Appendix  3  lists  ADB-financed  TA  and \nassistance by other development partners. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n11.  The proposed Project will restore the railway\u2019s infrastructure by rehabilitating its existing \ntrack and reestablishing Cambodia\u2019s rail connection with Thailand. This will be initiated in 2007 \nfor completion in 2009. The railway\u2019s operations will be improved through restructuring, which is \nongoing and will be completed in 2007 with the award to a private railway operator of a \nconcession  to  operate  the  railway  commercially  for  a  period  of  33  years  under  a  PPP \narrangement. Restructuring is being implemented through an advisory TA that advises the \nGovernment on the future structure of the railway subsector and is advising on the selection of \nthe  PPP  railway  operator.  The  PPP  railway  operator  will  be  selected  after  competitive \ninternational  bidding  for  the  concession.  The  rehabilitation  investment  and  the  associated \nrestructuring will together set the stage for efficient rail services, which in turn will realize the \nProject's  objectives,  namely:  improving  the  transport  sector's  efficiency  by  increasing  the \ndiversity of transport modes and routes and resurrecting the railway on a sustainable basis. \n12.  The governments of Malaysia and Thailand have discussed with the Government of \nCambodia support and cooperation to reconstruct the destroyed link between Sisophon and \nPoipet and to reconnect the railways in Cambodia and Thailand. Malaysia has confirmed the \nprovision of reclaimed rails for reconstruction of the destroyed link on a grant basis. Thailand \nhas expressed its intent to undertake the necessary works in Thailand to reconnect the two \nrailways, and negotiations between Cambodia and Thailand on renewing the railway cross-\nborder agreement between the two countries and reestablishing the physical link between the \ntwo railways are ongoing. \n13.  The railway consists of two lines: (i) the Northern Line, which was built in the 1930s and \nconnects Phnom Penh to Poipet on the border with Thailand, where it links with the railway in \nThailand; and (ii) the Southern Line, which was build in the late 1960s and connects Phnom \n                                                 \n9  ADB.  2005.

The Northern Line is 388 km long, of \nwhich the last 48 km to the border with Thailand were destroyed during the war. The Southern \nLine branches off the Northern Line about 9 km from the station in Phnom Penh. The Southern \nLine is about 254 km long from where it branches off. The total distance by rail between Phnom \nPenh and Sihanoukville is 263 km. The railway is meter gauge, as are the railway networks in \nneighboring countries. \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The outcome of the proposed Project would be a rehabilitated and restructured railway \nthat  would  (i) increase  the  efficiency  of  the  overall  transport  sector  by  increasing  the \ncompetitiveness of the railway, (ii) secure the long-term sustainability of the railway subsector \nthrough  improved  productivity  and  efficiency  and  adoption  of  a  market  based  tariff,  and \n(iii) reduce road damage and road traffic risks associated with the movement of heavy and \ndangerous  goods.  The  Project  would  also  (i) facilitate  economic  growth  in  Cambodia  by \nproviding  cost-effective  and  efficient  railway  transport,  (ii) facilitate  subregional  trade  and \neconomic growth in Thailand, (iii) pave the way for proposed future construction of a new \nrailway line between Cambodia and Viet Nam, (iv) reduce wear and tear from heavy cargo \nhaulage  on  Cambodia\u2019s  road  network,  (v) improve  road  safety  by  diverting  heavy  and \nhazardous cargo from the roads to inherently safer railway transport, and (vi) reduce public \nsector  losses.  The  Project  assumes  that  the  railway  subsector  has  been  successfully \nrestructured and that a commercial PPP railway operator is in place. \nB.  Outputs \n15.  The  output  of  the  proposed  Project  would  be  about  650  km  of  rehabilitated  or \nreconstructed railway line with associated stations and terminals; train traveling at speeds of 50 \nkm per hour; and a maximum axle load of 15 tons on the Northern Line, which is consistent with \nthe axle load standard in Thailand, and 20 tons on the Southern Line, which is consistent with \nthe original design axle load for that line and would be required to operate bulk cement trains \nand other heavy loads to and from Sihanoukville. The railway would connect with the railway in \nThailand and with water transport in Sihanoukville and Phnom Penh. \n16.  The Project will undertake the following: \n(i)  Rehabilitate  the  Southern  Line.  This  will  involve  (a) rehabilitation  of  the \nSouthern  Line  from  Phnom  Penh  to  Sihanoukville  (approximately  254  km), \nincluding  making  major  repairs  to  embankments,  replacing  worn  out  and \nunserviceable sleepers, fittings and ballasting; (b) rehabilitating or reconstructing \nstructures inclusing bridges, culverts, buildings and drains; (c) constructing a new \npassing loop; (d) tamping track to restore an operational speed of 50 km per \nhour; (e) rehabilitating the rail link to the port in Sihanoukville and extending it to \nthe container port (a schematic outline is in Appendix 4); and (f) undertaking \nancillary works at level crossings. \n(ii)  Rehabilitate the Northern Line. This will involve (a) rehabilitating the Northern \nLine from Phnom Penh to Sisophon (approximately 340 km), including making \nmajor repairs to embankments, ballasting, and installation of missing fittings; \n(b)   rehabilitating  or  reconstructing  structures  including  bridges,  culverts, \nbuildings and drains; (c) tamping track to restore an operational speed of 50 km \nper hour; (d) rehabilitating an existing rail link to the port at Phnom Penh on the \nMekong River and (e) undertaking ancillary works at level crossings. \n ", "6 \n(iii)  Reconstruct  the  destroyed  rail  link. This will include (a) reconstructing the \ndestroyed rail link from Sisophon to Poipet (48 km) and reestablishing the railway \nconnection across the border, including making major repairs to embankments, \npreparing  track  bed  and  ballasting,  rehabilitating  or  reconstructing  structures \nincluding bridges, culverts, buildings and drains, and laying track; (b) constructing \nancillary facilities at level crossings; and (c) building passing loops and a station \nat Poipet with facilities for border crossing (a schematic outline is in Appendix 4). \n(iv)  Mitigate  the  adverse  impact  of  restructuring.  Restructuring will affect the \ncurrent approximately 1,100 railway employees. The impact will be mitigated \nthrough  (a) providing  compensation  for  future  income  losses  for  redundant \nrailway employees, (b) providing compensation for lost pension rights for railway \nemployees  whether  made  redundant  or  rehired  by  the  future  PPP  railway \noperator, and (c) counseling and retraining railway employees. \n \n17.  Lessons.  The  MPWT's  capacity  to  handle  ADB-financed  projects  has  improved \nconsiderably  in  recent  years.  Overall,  project  implementation  is  generally  satisfactory,  but \ncertain aspects need improvement. Earlier loans, both closed and ongoing loans, encountered \ndelays  in  relation  to  procurement,  resettlement  and  compensation,  and  counterpart  fund \npayments. The key lessons from these loans were that there was a need to ensure that (i) \nprocurement approval is delegated to the project management unit; (ii) processes for approving \nbid documents and awarding contracts that are applicable to ADB-financed contracts under a \nloan are clarified at the outset; (iii) satisfactory resettlement plans and frameworks are in place \nbefore loans are approved; (iv) specific environmental requirements, including documentation \nand reporting requirements, are included in loan covenant and bidding documents; and (v) \nagreement on the release of counterpart funds is reached with the Ministry of Economy and \nFinance (MEF). The MPWT's capacity in relation to social and environmental safeguards will be \nfurther strengthened under the Project, and discussions with MEF have been held to streamline \nthe disbursement of counterpart funds. The MPWT's dependence on consultants was high \nunder earlier loans, especially with respect to procurement, social and environmental studies, \nand project performance monitoring. Enhancing the MPWT\u2019s capacity will be built into this loan \nby involving MPWT staff in all stages of project implementation. \nC.  Special Features \n1.  Regional Cooperation \n18.  Cambodia\u2019s  railway  is  a  strategic  element  of  the  GMS  transport  sector  strategy\u2019s \nsouthern corridor (footnote 3), which connects Cambodia, Thailand, and southern Viet Nam. \nThe corridor encompasses three road links and one railway link. The road links are the southern \nlink from Bangkok in Thailand, along the coast via Kampot in Cambodia, to Nam Can in Viet \nNam; and the central and northern links are from Bangkok to Sisophon in Cambodia, where \nthey split, with the northern link continuing via Siem Reap, Stung Treng, and Ratanakiri to Quy \nNhon in Viet Nam and the central route continuing via Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City and the \nport of Vung Tau in Viet Nam. The railway link generally follows the central road route from \nBangkok to Phnom Penh, where it ends. The governments of Cambodia and Viet Nam are \nconsidering developing a new railway line from Phnom Penh via Kampong Cham in Cambodia \nand Loc Nech in Viet Nam to Ho Chi Minh City. The section in Viet Nam is included in the \n ", "7 \nVietnamese  Government\u2019s  master  plan  for  railway  infrastructure  development, 11  with \nconstruction planned during 2011\u20132020 to support the development of mining resources around \nLoc Ninh. In Cambodia, the Interministerial SKRL Committee, chaired by the deputy prime \nminister, has been established to develop and coordinate the proposed new railway section in \nCambodia and is currently preparing a technical feasibility study. Implementation of the Project \nand subsequent construction of the proposed railway line between Phnom Penh and Ho Chi \nMinh City in Viet Nam would complete the railway component of the GMS southern corridor and \nat the same time would complete the SKRL, which is a long-term development priority for the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations. \n2.  Restructuring the Railway \n19.  The Government has previously invited private sector participation in the provision of \ntransport  infrastructure  and  services.  Successful  examples  are  the  toll-financed  road \nmaintenance concession for National Road 4 and the concession for developing and operating \nthe  country's  two  international  airports  in  Phnom  Penh  and  Siem  Reap.  The  ongoing \nrestructuring TA emphasizes transparency at all stages of the process of granting concessions \nby  establishing  an  adequate  regulatory  and  contractual  framework  for  the  concession, \nemploying  transparent  and  competitive  bidding  procedures  to  appoint  the  concessionaire, \nimplementing proper staff retention and replacement mechanisms, and providing adequate and \ntimely information on the process to the public. The restructuring process is intended to serve as \na model of best practice for future concessions in the country. \n20.  The  key  activities  of  the  ongoing  restructuring  TA  (footnote  10)  are  to  (i) plan  and \nprepare  restructuring  of  the  railway  subsector;  (ii) provide  advisory  services  to  assist  the \nGovernment with the formation of a PPP railway operator using internationally recognized best \npractices  for  international  competitive  bidding  among  interested  private  sector  consortia; \n(iii) advise  the  Government  on  the  choice  of  a  depository  authority  for  the  Government's \nholdings of railway land and infrastructure; (iv) advise the Government on the best approach for \nestablishing regulatory oversight of the railway subsector in terms of the regulatory regime, the \nscope  of  regulation,  and  the  structure  of  the  regulator;  (v) provide  TA  in  relation  to  the \nestablishment  of  the  transport  regulator  and  the  depository  authority;  (vi) advise  the \nGovernment on how best to handle staff retrenchment in a transparent and fair manner; and \n(vii) document the process in sufficient detail to allow for future replication. The restructuring TA \nwas initiated in January 2006 for completion in July 2007. \n21.  The Government approved the strategy and plan for restructuring developed under the \nrestructuring TA on 30 June 2006. In summary, it outlines the following main principles for \nrestructuring and future operation of the railway: \n(i)  The Government will (a) rehabilitate the railway\u2019s infrastructure with support from \nADB and others, and (b) restructure the railway subsector. \n(ii)  A new railway operating company will be established that is owned and operated \nby a private concessionaire. The railway operator will be granted exclusive rights \nto provide railway services under a concession agreement that will be protected \nby law. The Government will award the concession after international competitive \nbidding. The railway operator will operate commercially and will be free to set \nprices  and  service  levels.  If  the  Government  decides  that  non-commercial \npassenger services are required for social reasons on part or all of the railway \ninfrastructure, the concession agreement shall provide how this public service \n                                                 \n11 Government of Viet Nam. 2002.

The railway operator will pay a \nconcession fee to the Government for use of the railway\u2019s infrastructure. \n(iii)  The Government will (a) prepare and present a railway reform law for approval \nby  Parliament;  (b) encourage  fair  modal  competition  by  enforcing  existing \nrestrictions on road vehicle load limits; (c) negotiate a new cross-border railway \ntransport agreement with Thailand; (d) create and maintain a dedicated railway \nreform  Internet  web  site  to  promote  and  create  public  awareness  about  the \nrailway reform law, the railway operator concession, and the process of granting \nconcessions; (e) establish a concession management unit within the MPWT to \nmanage the railway operator concession; and (f) undertake to monitor the PPP \nrailway  operator\u2019s  compliance  with  health,  safety,  labor,  and  environmental \nrequirements. \n(iv)  The Government will establish a property development entity and make available \nto it the right to rent and develop designated parcels of the RRC\u2019s land assets to \nensure that funds are available to meet the Government\u2019s expenses towards \nfinancing of the railway and its future expansion. Such land shall not be required \nfor  railway  operations  and  will  not  be  alienated  from  state  ownership.  The \nproperty development entity shall be structured in accordance with principles of \ngood  governance,  transparency,  and  accountability,  and  will  preferentially \ndedicate its net revenues to provide funding for public service obligations, such \nas noncommercial passenger traffic, and for future capital works for the railway. \n22.  The principles of the strategy and plan for restructuring are summarized in a policy letter \nfrom the Government to ADB\u2019s President, dated 17 July 2006 (Appendix 5). \n23.  The shortlisting of potential bidders to undertake the railway operator concession was \napproved in November 2006, and bids, bid evaluations, and concession contract negotiations \nare scheduled to be completed by late March 2007. Award of the concession is a condition for \nloan effectiveness. \n3.  Staff Redundancy \n24.  As of February 2006, the RRC had 1,102 permanent staff. Restructuring will affect these \nstaff in varying ways, namely: \n(i)  The property holding entity that will manage railway land and infrastructure after \nthe  privatization  of  railway  operations  is  expected  to  require  about  30  RRC \nemployees  for  its  operations.  Their  service-related  benefits  are  expected  to \ncontinue without interruption.  \n(ii)  The new PPP railway operator is expected to hire about 630 RRC staff as new \nemployees. These employees will continue to enjoy employment income, but will \nlose  their  accumulated  service  benefits,  principally  those  associated  with \nemployment termination notices, indemnification payments, retirement pensions, \nand annual leave. \n(iii)  Of the remaining staff, about 27 are expected to retire before the restructuring \nbecomes  effective,  leaving  about  375  redundant  staff  who  will  have  to  be \ntransferred  to  other  Government  employment,  find  new  employment  in  the \nprivate sector, or take early retirement. \n \n25.  A mitigation plan for railway staff affected by the restructuring of the railway subsector \nhas been prepared and was approved by the Government on 30 June 2006 (footnote 10). The \nmitigation plan provides for compensation, counseling and retraining of redundant staff, and \n ", "9 \ncompensation for loss of pension rights. The plan will be implemented under the proposed \nProject. \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n26.  The Project investment cost is estimated at $73.0 million (Table 1). The detailed cost \nestimates are in Appendix 6. The cost estimates include taxes and duties amounting to $7.4 \nmillion. \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \nAmounta \nItem   \n($ million) \nA.

Financing Plan \n27.  The Project\u2019s financing plan is shown in Table 2 and details are in Appendix 6. ADB will \nprovide a loan of $42 million equivalent (57% of the total cost) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources.  Interest  financing  charges  during  implementation  will  be  capitalized.  OFID  will \nprovide a loan of $13 million to jointly finance the civil works component with ADB. The OFID \nloan will be administered by ADB.12 The Government of Malaysia will provide a grant in kind of \nreclaimed rail valued at about $2.8 million equivalent (4%) and the Government will finance \n$15.2 million equivalent (21%), comprising all costs of Project administration, taxes, clearance \nof unexploded ordnance, compensation of railway staff in connection with restructuring, and \nresettlement and land acquisition, but not the cost of associated consultants, which will be \nfinanced by ADB. The ADB loan will have a 32-year maturity, including, an 8-year grace period. \nInterest will be at 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year over the remaining \nterm of the loan. The OFID loan will be repayable over 20-years, including a 5-year grace \nperiod, with a fixed interest rate of 1% per year and a 1% fixed service charge per year. The \nBorrower will be the Kingdom of Cambodia.  \n                                                 \n12 OFID acknowledged the Government\u2019s request for cofinancing of $13 million in April 2006. \n ", "10 \nTable 2: Project Financing Plan \nTotal  Percentage of Total \nSource  ($ million)  Project Costs \nAsian Development Bank  42.0  57 \nOPEC Fund for International Development     \n(administered by the Asian Development Bank)  13.0  18 \nGovernment of Malaysia (grant in kind)  2.8  4 \nGovernment of Cambodia  15.2  21 \n  Total  73.0  100 \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n28.  The  MPWT  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  Project.  Special  implementation \narrangements have been developed for the Project that take into account the fact that physical \nimplementation  of  the  rehabilitation  works  will  take  place  while  the  RRC,  which  has  the \nknowledge and experience for undertaking the envisaged rehabilitation works, is being divested \nof the functions of railway operation and maintenance in favor of a new PPP railway operator.13 \nA project implementation team that was set up within the MPWT to implement the project \npreparatory TA will be expanded with additional qualified technical, financial, and support staff \nfor  project  management  and  implementation.  The  team  will  be  responsible  for  Project \nimplementation, including handling procurement, withdrawing loan proceeds, and reporting to \nADB. \n29.  The National Committee for the Singapore\u2013Kunming Railway Project, which is a high-\nlevel committee to facilitate realization of the SKRL in Cambodia and is chaired by the deputy \nprime minister, will act as the steering committee for the Project. Representatives of relevant \nlocal governments and the PPP railway operator will be invited to committee meetings as \nnecessary. \n2.  Implementation \n30.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  3  years  for  completion  in  December  2009. \nExceptional floods in 2006 damaged parts of the Southern and Northern lines to the extent that \ntransportation of materials and equipment for the Project\u2019s civil works could be affected and \nProject implementation could be delayed. To ensure timely project implementation, the Project\u2019s \ncivil works contract will require the contractor to complete urgent repairs required to keep the \nrailway operational within the first 3 months of contract mobilization. The Government has \nrequested, and ADB has approved, the use of retroactive financing up to $1.5 million and \nadvance procurement to enable accelerated recruitment and mobilization of the supervision \nconsultant  prior  to  the  declaration  of  loan  effectiveness  in  March  or  April  2007  and  early \nselection and mobilization of civil works contractors. The Government has agreed to ensure that \nthe concession agreement with the PPP railway operator allows for temporary adjustment of the \ntrain timetable and train speed limitations as required to ensure that civil works under the \n                                                 \n13  For the same reason, during the selection of the railway operator, bidders will be advised of the procedure for \nimplementing track rehabilitation and rebuilding bridges, including phasing, requirements for track possessions  \nand temporary slowdowns to facilitate the civil works. The procedures for implementation of the works have been \nincorporated into the preparatory documents for bidding of the concession. \n ", "11 \nProject can be completed in accordance with the implementation schedule. The implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 7. \n3.  Procurement \n31.  The Procurement financed from the ADB and OFID loans will be done in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Civil works contracts will be procured through international \ncompetitive bidding. Contracts for supply and works with an estimated value of less than $1 \nmillion will be procured through national competitive bidding using the Government\u2019s standard \noperating procedures and procurement manual, which are acceptable to ADB. Supply and small \nworks contracts will use shopping for contracts with an estimated value of less than $100,000. \nThe procurement plan is in Appendix 8. \n4.  Consulting Services \n32.  The Project will require 104 person-months of international and 176 person-months of \nnational  consultant  inputs.  The  MPWT  will  engage  an  international  consulting  firm  for \nconstruction  supervision,  quality  assurance,  environmental  supervision  and  monitoring, \nresettlement  supervision  and  monitoring,  socioeconomic  impact  assessment,  and  project \nperformance monitoring. All recruitment will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof Consulting Services using the quality- and cost-based selection procedure and simplified \ntechnical  proposals.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  supervision  consulting  services  are  in \nAppendix 9. \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n33.  The Government has agreed that relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy14 \nwill be included in the Loan Agreement and in all bidding and contract documents for the \nProject. The Government has also agreed that this policy will apply to the selection of the \nrailway operator and the implementation of the concession agreement. All contracts financed by \nADB and OFID in connection with the Project will include provisions specifying ADB\u2019s right to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the MPWT and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. The Government has \nagreed to establish a web site for procurement under the Project to enhance transparency by \npresenting detailed information on the procurement process, bidders, and contract awards in \nEnglish and Khmer. This information will also be published on public notice boards at commune \ncenters and other public buildings in the project area. \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n34.  All disbursements under the ADB and OFID loans will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2001). \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n35.  The MPWT will maintain separate accounts for the Project, including assets, and will \nhave such accounts and related financial statements audited annually by an external auditor in \naccordance with auditing standards acceptable to ADB. The MPWT will, within 6 months of the \nend  of  each  fiscal  year,  submit  certified  copies  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 1998. Anticorruption Policy. Manila. \n ", "12 \nstatements and the auditor's reports, in English, to ADB. The audit of the financial statements \nwill include (i) an assessment of the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems with \nrespect  to  project  expenditures  and  other  financial  transactions,  (ii)  an  assessment  of \ncompliance with loan covenants and ADB\u2019s project management requirements, and (iii) an \nopinion on the use of the statement of expenditures procedure. \n36.  The MPWT will make satisfactory arrangements for reporting the progress of project \nimplementation by submitting quarterly progress reports, the form and content of which will be \nagreed  with  ADB.  The  MPWT  will  monitor  project  implementation  in  accordance  with  the \nimplementation schedule and will keep ADB informed of any significant deviations from the \nschedule. The quarterly report will include basic data on utilization of funds, achievement of \nimmediate development objectives, compliance with covenants, implementation progress, land \nacquisition, resettlement progress, and major issues and problems. Within 3 months of physical \ncompletion, the MPWT will submit a project completion report to ADB that will provide a detailed \nevaluation of the project design, costs, contractors\u2019 and consultants\u2019 performance, social and \neconomic impact, economic rate of return, and other details as may be requested by ADB. \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n37.  The MPWT has agreed to a set of indicators for evaluating Project performance in \nrelation to its impacts, outcomes, outputs, and conditions. Sample indicators, to be reviewed at \nthe  start  of  project  implementation,  are  in  Appendix  10.  At  the  beginning  of  project \nimplementation, the MPWT will establish baseline and target values for the indicators. The \nindicators will be measured at project inception, project completion, and 3 years after Project \ncompletion and compared with the baseline. Where relevant, indicators will be disaggregated by \ngender. Support for monitoring and evaluation to help establish the monitoring and evaluation \nsystem will be provided as part of supervision consulting services. The main sources of data will \ninclude (i) secondary data from the Borrower\u2019s sources, (ii) traffic counts, (iii) railway statistics, \n(iv) shipper  and  passenger  surveys,  (v) traffic  accident  database,  (vi) producer  and  price \nsurveys,  and  (vii) trade  and  customs  statistics.  The  MPWT  shall  submit  a  report  to  ADB \nsummarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, project completion, and 3 years after \nproject completion. \n9.  Project Review \n38.  In addition to regular annual reviews by ADB staff, the Government and ADB will jointly \nundertake  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project  in  about  mid-2008  to  assess  (i)  the  status  of \nimplementation, (ii) the design and construction standards, (iii) the performance of consultants \nand contractors, (iv) the impacts of the Project, (v) the progress of sector reform, (vi) the status \nof compliance with the covenants stipulated in the Loan Agreement, and (vii) the need for any \nchanges in the project scope or schedule to achieve the project\u2019s impact and objectives. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n39.  The Project\u2019s benefits and impacts were assessed along with potential risks associated \nwith the assumptions made in the project design. The combined benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs, given the likelihood of the risks occurring. \n ", "13 \nA.  Policy \n40.  Successful restructuring of the railway subsector would transform the railway into a \ncommercially-oriented transport operator, which is required to realize the Project\u2019s benefits in \nfull. Successful restructuring is a condition for loan effectiveness and has been agreed with the \nGovernment. International railway operators have expressed interest in bidding for the railway \noperator concession. This significantly decreases the risk that private sector participation will not \nproceed as intended. \nB.  Social \n41.  The social and gender strategy set out in the summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy  (Appendix  11)  includes  strategies  for  participatory  resettlement  activities,  social \nprotection  measures  for  affected  railway  employees,  Project-related  gender  issues  and \nHIV/AIDS prevention. The socioeconomic survey indicates that the Project is not expected to \nhave any specific impact on ethnic minority groups that differs from the impact on the majority \nKhmers. ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) is not triggered. The gender strategy \nincludes capacity building for the MPWT, other relevant agencies, and leaders of those affected. \nIncreased  capacity  on  the  part  of  the  MPWT  and  those  affected  will  enable  effective \nimplementation  of  resettlement  and  livelihood  activities.  Capacity  building  during  the \nconstruction phase will include an HIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness program and will \ninvolve women leaders and youth from affected households in squatter settlements, district \nwomen officials, and women health workers.  \n42.  The Project is formulated to minimize potential risks relating to involuntary resettlement; \nhowever, compensation, resettlement, and income restoration measures might not be delivered \nas agreed, thereby impoverishing those affected and delaying the start of civil works. The \nreestablishment of railway traffic does not affect the transportation of goods across the border \nwith Thailand by pushcart and motorcycle, and therefore does not adversely impact the income \nof pushcart pullers and motorcycle drivers in Poipet. At the same time, increased transportation \nof goods in the border area would improve commerce and the general economy in the area, \nwhich would generate new income-earning opportunities in the services sector and in informal \nsector  economic  activities.  Restructuring  of  the  railway  could  impoverish  laid-off  railway \nemployees, and the Project includes a mitigation program to address this. The MPWT will help \nprepare and implement the mitigation program with assistance from international and national \nconsultants recruited under the Project. \nC.  Resettlement \n43.  The Project will permanently clear a 7-meter wide corridor of impact centered on the \nmiddle of the railway track. The corridor of impact is narrower than the railway\u2019s right-of-way to \nminimize immediate resettlement impacts. Estimates indicate that about 2,630 households15 will \nbe  affected  by  the  Project,  of  which  about  965  households  (about  4,150  people)  will  be \ndisplaced and about 1,660 households (about 7,140 people) will experience minor impacts \ncaused by the loss of secondary structures (wells, fences, etc.) and trees. Four large structures \n(three  privately  owned  buildings  and  one  publicly  owned  building)  will  be  fully  or  partially \naffected. Displaced households and businesses face the risk of losing access to their sources of \n                                                 \n15 The number of households is equivalent to the number of project-affected people as defined in ADB\u2019s resettlement \npolicy, where it is the number of affected household heads. The term household is used here to distinguish from \nthe total number of persons affected, which is the total number of people living and working in the affected \nhouseholds.  \n ", "14 \nincome if they are moved too far away from their current residence, thus resettlement sites have \nbeen identified close to current places of occupancy. Resettlement is most significant in Poipet, \non the border with Thailand, where large numbers of people have settled on the railway\u2019s \ncurrently unused land. About 635 households (about 2,730 people) will be displaced in Poipet, \nequivalent to 66% of total displacement. The area required for reconstructing the Poipet station \nhas been reduced from 6 hectares to 3 hectares to minimize displacement. \n44.  In  addition  to  clearing  structures  within  the  right-of-way,  bamboo  rail  transport \noperators16 are currently transporting people and goods along the railway and will lose their \nlivelihoods once the railway has been rehabilitated. Some villages along the railway lack road \naccess, thus the bamboo railway service is villagers\u2019 only means of access. In such places, the \nProject will compensate for the loss of bamboo railway services by establishing road access for \nlight (motorcycle) traffic using the railway\u2019s right-of-way. A census of bamboo rail transport \noperators identified a total of 189 operators, 12 of whom were women. For more than half of \nthese operators (102 men and 3 women), providing bamboo rail transport services is their main \nsource of income. The Project will provide the bamboo rail transport operators with funds to \nenable them to switch from rail to road transport providers. \n45.  The summary resettlement plan is in Appendix 12. The resettlement plan ensures that all \nthose  affected,  irrespective  of  their  tenure  status,  will  be  able  to  restore  or  improve  their \nsocioeconomic conditions. The resettlement plan has been disclosed to affected persons by \nmeans of a public information booklet and they will be further consulted on resettlement site \noptions.  Following  detailed  project  design,  the  MWPT  will  update  and  implement  the \nresettlement plan with guidance from the Interministerial Resettlement Committee under MEF \nand assistance from international and national consultants recruited under the Project. \n46.  The Government has agreed that in the event that all or parts of the right-of-way outside \nthe corridor of impact would need to be cleared in the future, the resulting resettlement would be \nperformed according to the same standards as under the Project. \nD.  Financial \n47.  The financial analysis indicates that the Project will have a financial internal rate of return \nof about 10.2%, well above the real weighted average cost of capital of 4.1%. The Government \nwill establish a property development entity to monetize the railway\u2019s landholdings that are no \nlonger needed for railway operations. The net revenues of the property development entity will \nunderwrite  the  Government\u2019s  public  service  obligation  expenditures  associated  with \nnoncommercial  passenger  traffic;  and  future  capital  expenditures  for  development  of  the \nrailway, notably, the possible future construction of a railway line to Viet Nam. The concession \nagreement will require the railway operator to submit annual audited accounts and operating \nstatistics that include performance indicators for monitoring by the Government and ADB for 5 \nyears following Project completion. The financial analysis is in Appendix 13. \n                                                 \n16  Bamboo railway services are provided by means of small, motorized trolleys constructed and operated by small-\nscale private operators. The Project includes full mitigation for the operators as part of the resettlement plan and \nwill also establish access for light traffic along sections of the Northern Line, where bamboo railway services are \ncurrently the only means of motorized access to some isolated communities without road access. Where needed, \nthe contractor\u2019s construction roads will be left in place after construction has been completed. \n ", "15 \nE.  Economic \n48.  The main sources of benefits are associated with savings from the diversion of heavy \nfreight and container traffic from road transport to more economical rail transport that include \nreduced costs in relation to road maintenance and accidents. The traffic forecast is based on \nprojected future economic growth in Cambodia and assumes that the railway will capture a \nsignificant share of the traffic generated by three new cement plants that are currently being \nplanned and constructed and of future container traffic to and from Sihanoukville. Projections of \ncontainer traffic on the Southern Line assume that the railway has direct access to the container \nport\u2019s  stacking  area  for  loading  and  offloading  containers.  Under  these  assumptions,  and \nassuming in the base case that economic growth is in line with Cambodia\u2019s recent performance, \nthe economic analysis indicates that the Project will have an economic internal rate of return of \nabout 24.9%. The economic analysis is in Appendix 14. \nF.  Environmental \n49.  The railway alignment is outside environmentally sensitive areas such as national parks \nand  other  protected  areas  and  their  buffer  zones  and  the  proposed  Project  falls  into \nenvironmental category B. The MPWT will submit the initial environmental examination report to \nthe Ministry of Environment for its review and approval. The Project\u2019s environmental impacts \ncan be mitigated by proper engineering and environmental management measures, which have \nbeen included in the Project\u2019s environment management plan and will be implemented by the \nMPWT with support from international and national consultants. The Supplementary Appendix \npresents the summary initial environmental examination. \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n50.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and the MPWT have given the \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n1.  Draft Railway Reform Law \n(i)  The  Government  will  undertake  to  present  a  draft  railway  reform  law  or \nequivalent legislation to the National Assembly. The draft law will follow the \nprinciples outlined in the Government\u2019s Policy Letter issued to ADB and dated 17 \nJuly 2006. The Government will use its best efforts to facilitate passage of the \ndraft law before the end March 2007, by which time a concession agreement is \nanticipated  to  have  been  negotiated  for  private  sector  operation  of  the \nrestructured railway. \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that prior to enactment of the railway reform law (or \nequivalent legislation), it will not take any actions that would be inconsistent with \nthe principles described in the Policy Letter. \n(iii)  The  Government  will  establish  a  commercially  operated  railway  property \ndevelopment  entity.  This  entity\u2019s  net  revenues  will  ipreferentially  be  used  to \nsubsidize  public  service  obligation  railway  traffic,  such  as  noncommercial \npassenger  traffic,  and  for  development  of  the  railway  system,  such  as  the \npossible future construction of a new line to Viet Nam. \n2.  Safeguards \n(iv)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  civil  works  contracts  under  the  Project \nincorporate  provisions  to  ensure  that  contractors  (a) comply  with  the \n ", "16 \nGovernment\u2019s  environmental  regulations,  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  (2002), \nthe environmental management plan for the Project, and the initial environmental \nexamination; (b) comply with all applicable laws and regulations of Cambodia, \nincluding ratified international treaty obligations; (c) do not employ child labor and \nprovide safe working conditions for male and female workers; (d) do not provide \nmale and female workers with different wages or benefits for work of equal value; \n(e) implement the provisions set forth in the gender action plan, to be prepared \nfor  the  Project  to  operationalize  its  gender  strategy,  to  the  extent  that  it  is \napplicable to contractors; and (f) carry out training programs and awareness \ncampaigns on HIV/AIDS and human trafficking at campsites and in communities \nalong  the  railway  lines.  The  MPWT  will  monitor  compliance  through  an \nindependent monitor. \n3.  Resettlement \n(v)  The Government will ensure that the MPWT updates the resettlement plan after \ndetailed  project  design  based  on  a  detailed  measurement  survey  of  losses \nfollowing the recruitment and mobilization of an independent monitoring agency \nand of the resettlement supervision consultants. The update will be prepared in \nfull consultation with affected persons and will be disclosed to them. The updated \nresettlement plan for any section of the railway will be submitted to ADB for \nreview  and  approval  before  commencement  of  any  land  acquisition  and \nrelocation activities for that section. The MPWT will implement the approved, \nupdated  resettlement  plan  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  laws, \nregulations,  and  procedures  and  ADB's  policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement \n(1995).  In  the  case  of  discrepancies  between  the  Government\u2019s  laws, \nregulations, and procedures and ADB's policy, ADB's policy will prevail. \n(vi)  Where  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  cannot  be  avoided,  civil  works \ncontractors will not be issued a notice of possession of the pertinent section of \nrailway  until  (a) the  satisfactory  completion  of  compensation  payments  and \nrelocation to new sites for that particular section, (b) the agreed rehabilitation \nassistance  is  in  place,  and  (c)  the  particular  section  is  free  from  all \nencumbrances. \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that if people in the remaining right-of-way beyond \nthe corridor of impact are resettled in the future, the resettlement will be carried \nout in accordance with the standards established for this Project. \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that only land owned by the RRC as of the date of \nloan  effectiveness  will  be  considered  for  development  by  the  property \ndevelopment entity. The Government will also ensure that people residing on \nsuch land who would need to be resettled to enable development are resettled \nusing the standards of this Project.  \n(ix)  The  Government  will  ensure  the  timely  provision  of  counterpart  funds  for \nresettlement to meet any unforeseen obligations in excess of the resettlement \nbudget estimates to satisfy resettlement requirements and objectives. \n4.  Anticorruption Policy \n(x)  The Government will comply with, and will cause the MPWT to comply with, \nADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  (footnote  14).  The  Government  (a) acknowledges \nADB\u2019s right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project; and (b) agrees \nto cooperate fully with, and to cause the MPWT to cooperate fully with, any such \ninvestigation and to extend all necessary assistance, including providing access \n ", "17 \nto all relevant accounts and records, as may be necessary for the satisfactory \ncompletion of any such investigation. \n(xi)  Without limiting the generality of the preceding paragraph, the Government will \n(a) ensure that the MPWT conducts periodic inspections of contractors\u2019 activities \nrelated  to  fund  withdrawals  and  settlements;  and  (b) ensure  and  cause  the \nMPWT  to  ensure  that  all  contracts  financed  by  ADB  in  connection  with  the \nProject  include  provisions  specifying  ADB\u2019s  right  to  audit  and  examine  the \nrecords and accounts of all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders as they relate to the Project. \n(xii)  In addition to these requirements, to deter corruption and increase transparency, \nthe  Government  will  set  up  a  web  site  to  disclose  information  about \nprocurements related to the Project. For each contract, the web site shall include \na list of participating bidders, the name of the winning bidder, the basic details of \nthe bidding procedures adopted, the amount of the contract awarded, and the list \nof goods and/or services procured. In addition to the web-based disclosure, the \npublic shall be provided with detailed information about procurement on public \nnotice boards (for example, at commune council facilities) in the Project area. \n(xiii)  The  Government  will  ensure  (a) that  the  process  for  selecting  the  railway \noperator  and  execution  of  the  concession  agreement  are  subject  to  ADB\u2019s \nanticorruption  policy  (footnote  14),  specifically  including  ADB\u2019s  right  to \ninvestigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  selection  process  or  to  the \nimplementation  of  the  concession  agreement;  and  (b) that  the  concession \nagreement includes provisions that no corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices will be tolerated in connection with the agreement and that all parties to \nthe agreement will fully cooperate with any investigation into any alleged corrupt, \nfraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  and  shall  extend  all  necessary \nassistance, including providing access to all relevant accounts  and records as \nmay be necessary for the satisfactory completion of any such investigation. \n5.  Gender Strategy  \n(xiv)  The Government will ensure that women, in particular, those who belong to \nwomen-headed households and ethnic minority groups, participate to an extent \nsatisfactory to ADB in (a) public consultation meetings on resettlement planning; \n(b) detailed measurement of losses; (c) capacity-building programs relating to \nresettlement;  and  (d)  relocation,  compensation,  and  livelihood  improvement \nactivities to be undertaken under the Project. \n(xv)  The Government will ensure that (a) any land rights granted to affected people \nwill be issued in the names of both husband and wife; (b) women railway staff \naffected by restructuring are included in counseling and retraining programs for \nsecuring  employment  opportunities;  and  (c) gender  sensitization  training  is \nundertaken, particularly in the context of resettlement, for pertinent MPWT staff \nand district resettlement committees, district officials, and commune leaders. \n6.  Project Monitoring \n(xvi)  At the beginning of Project implementation, the MPWT will establish baseline and \ntarget values for the indicators before the start of works. The indicators shall \ninclude,  at  a  minimum,  information  on  railway  passenger  and  freight  traffic; \neffective average train speed; container traffic; traffic accidents; railway, road, \nand sea transport costs; heavy traffic on the railway versus roads; and producer \nprices as a share of the value of exports. The indicators shall be measured at \n ", "18 \nproject inception, project completion, and 3 years after project completion and \ncompared with baseline values. Support to help establish the monitoring and \nevaluation system shall be provided as part of supervision consulting services. \nThe main sources of data shall include (a) secondary data from the Borrower\u2019s \nsources,  (b) traffic  counts,  (c) railway  statistics,  (d) shipper  and  passenger \nsurveys,  (e) traffic  accident  database,  (f) producer  and  price  surveys,  and \n(g) trade  and  customs  statistics.  The  MPWT  shall  submit  a  report  to  ADB \nsummarizing the key findings of monitoring at inception, project completion, and \n3 years after project completion. \n7.  Cofinancing \n(xvii)  Within 6 months of the effective date of the loan, or at a later date as agreed with \nADB, the Borrower shall have obtained the OFID loan or shall have made other \narrangements acceptable to ADB to fund the amount to be provided by the OFID \nloan. \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n51.  Loan effectiveness is conditional on the selection of the railway operator through an \ninternational competitive bidding process and signing of a concession agreement, acceptable to \nADB, between the Government and the selected PPP railway operator that vests responsibility \nfor railway operations and maintenance with the PPP railway operator for the duration of the \nconcession. \n \nC.  Condition for Loan Signing \n \n52.  Signing  of  the  Loan  Agreement  will  be  conditional  upon  receipt  by  ADB  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s confirmation that rolling stock and other operating assets of the RRC that are \ncurrently  being  allocated  to  private  parties  will  be  duly  returned  to  RRC  free  of  all \nencumbrances, so they can be available for the new PPP Railway Operator as required on the \ndate of effectiveness of the Railway Operator Concession. \nVI.   RECOMMENDATION \n53.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve (i) the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 28,277,000 to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the \nRehabilitation of the Railway in Cambodia Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board, and (ii) the administration by ADB of a loan not exceeding $13,000,000 \nto the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Rehabilitation of the Railway in Cambodia Project to be \nprovided by the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) under the terms of a Letter of \nAdministration to be entered into between ADB and OFID.  \n \n \n                   \n                  Haruhiko Kuroda \n                                      President \n \n20 November 2006\n ", "  Appendix 1  19 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData \nDesign  Performance  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \n1.

Background and Issues \n1.  For  more  than  a  decade  the  Government\u2019s  emphasis  has  been  on  rehabilitating \nCambodia's core transport infrastructure to restore national cohesion and create the foundations \nfor economic growth. The two international airports (Phnom Penh and Siem Reap), the two \nmain ports (Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville), and the primary highway network will soon be fully \nrehabilitated and have adequate capacity. The railway is run down and needs to be rehabilitated \nand restructured to become an efficient alternative. Restructuring is ongoing and rehabilitation is \nexpected to start in 2007. \n2.  Nevertheless,  much  remains  to  be  done:  (i) most  provincial  and  rural  roads  are \nseasonally impassable to motorized traffic and await rehabilitation; (ii) inland water transport has \nprogressed slowly driven by the private sector, but such infrastructure as river ports needs to be \nupgraded and modernized to effectively support multimodal transport; (iii) domestic airports \nrequire repair and an assured financial basis to provide safe operations; (iv) traffic regulation \nand enforcement is weak or nonexistent and lack a sound legal basis, although a draft road law \nhas been prepared with support from the World Bank; (v) infrastructure development is mostly \ndonor financed, but shortages of funds and a lack of efficient and transparent mechanisms for \nmaintenance  planning,  disbursement,  and  execution  hinder  its  subsequent  operation  and \nmaintenance; and (vii) transport services are inefficient, partly because of poor infrastructure \nand partly because of market failure and rent seeking. Solving these problems is a prerequisite \nfor continued economic and social development. \n3.  The constraints to implementing infrastructure development activities are (i) a shortage \nof qualified and experienced professional staff that is only slowly abating, and (ii) a shortage of \nGovernment funding for infrastructure operation and maintenance. There is scope for further \ninvolving  the  private  sector  as  a source  of  financing  and  management  capacity  in  certain \ninfrastructure areas, notably, the railway and the sea and river ports and new terminal facilities \nsuch as container depots. In other areas, such as road infrastructure, private sector involvement \nis not currently feasible because traffic levels are generally too low to support toll-financed \ninvestment  and  maintenance.  Widespread  private  sector  involvement  in  road  infrastructure \nprovision and maintenance will probably not be viable for at least a decade.1  \n4.  The  execution  of  safeguard  policies,  especially  resettlement,  compensation,  and \nrehabilitation of those adversely impacted, has improved significantly in recent years, but there \nis still room for further improvement, especially the establishment of a firm legal basis for \nresettlement, compensation, and rehabilitation and of consistent implementation. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) is providing technical assistance in this regard.2 \n5.  Infrastructure  projects  have  had  little  induced  development  impact  in  terms  of  the \nemergence of national contractors, consulting engineers, and other service providers. \n                                                 \n1  The complex and interlinked issues of road maintenance funding, planning, disbursement, and execution are \ndiscussed  extensively  in:  ADB.  2002.

Manila (TA 4490 CAM). \n ", "22  Appendix 2 \nB.  Government Strategy \n6.  The primary tools of the Government's strategy since 1994 have been (i) to focus road \ninvestments on rehabilitating national highways and selected provincial, rural, and urban roads; \n(ii) to  undertake  comprehensive  privatization  of  transport  provision;  (iii)  to  selectively  relax \nrestrictive regulations, such as most restrictions on importing motor vehicles and all restrictions \non  access  by  foreign  airlines;  and  (iv) to  franchise  the  operation,  maintenance,  and \ndevelopment of National Road 4, the two international airports in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap, \nand air traffic control to the private sector. The Government's strategy has proven successful in \nrestoring a core transport system that connects the country\u2019s main centers and has significantly \ncontributed to integrating the national economy with the regional and global economies. \n7.  The Government has initiated a process of decentralization and reforms whereby, for \nexample,  the  delivery  of  transport  infrastructure  services,  which  was  previously  centrally \nmanaged by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT), is now delegated to the \nprovincial  level.  The  MPWT  itself  is  in  the  process  of  shifting  its  focus  away  from  direct \nmanagement  of  transport  infrastructure  toward  planning  and  oversight  of  the  sector.  The \nprocess is moving forward with significant support from ADB, the World Bank, and the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, but is encumbered by shortages of the skills and resources \nrequired to undertake these new roles both in the provinces and centrally. The reform process is \nnecessary, but given the lack of capacity, is fraught with difficulty in the short term. An example \nis road maintenance, for which disbursement is now directly to the provinces, which, however, \nlack the ability to produce credible road maintenance plans and adequately justified budgets. As \na result, road maintenance is generally poor even though uncommitted funds are available. \n8.  The  MPWT  is  currently  preparing  a  revised  strategy  for  future  development  of  the \ntransport sector based on the Cambodia Transport Sector Strategy Study (footnote 3), financed \nby ADB and completed in December 2002. In terms of transport sector development and \noperation, the draft strategy is likely to emphasize the following objectives and goals: \n(i)  Support  sustained  economic  growth  and  promote  external  trade  and \nforeign direct investment. Transport is an integral part of the production of \nnearly all goods and services. Good transport infrastructure and cost-effective \ntransport  is  a  precondition  for  Cambodia's  export  drive  and  for  successful \ndevelopment of its tourism potential, and is also a major factor in containing the \ncost of living and improving rural livelihoods. Increased diversity in transport \nsupply and improved transport logistics using multimodal transport chains are \nneeded  to  improve  Cambodia's  international  competitiveness  and  its \nattractiveness to direct foreign investors. \n(ii)  Support poverty reduction and integration of the country. By enabling new \nproductive  activities  in  areas  not  previously  open  to  economic  exchange, \ntransport  creates  the  foundations  for  more  inclusive  and  pro-poor  economic \ngrowth. Transport achieves this by providing cost-effective and reliable access to \neconomic  opportunities  and  social  services,  thereby  enabling  the  poor  to \nparticipate more fully in society. Accessible and dependable transport networks, \nespecially provincial roads, are needed to link the provinces and to integrate rural \nareas into the mainstream economy. \n(iii)  Streamline  and  focus  sector  institutions  and  expand  private  sector \ninvolvement  in  infrastructure  provision.  The  Government  emphasizes \nstrengthening sector institutions, especially the creation of clear mandates for \ntheir  activities,  as  the  basis  for  institutional  reform  and  strengthening.  The \nGovernment  recognizes  that  given  the  human  resources  constraint,  reform \n ", "  Appendix 2  23 \nrequires flexibility in implementation with the focus on efficiency, transparency, \nand\u2014whenever  efficient\u2014reliance  on  the  private  sector.  In  the  past,  the \nGovernment has shown a readiness to involve foreign and domestic investors in \nthe financing, development, and management of transport infrastructure. The \nGovernment intends to pursue this avenue further, and also strongly supports the \ndevelopment of national contractors to undertake infrastructure construction and \nmaintenance services. \n(iv)  Secure  the  sustainability  of  transport. Fuel taxation is a major source of \nrevenue for the Government, and charging for the use of infrastructure has been \nintroduced in most subsectors, but with a few exceptions, the scope for charging \nfull user costs is limited by low traffic loads. As the scope for direct Government \nfunding is equally limited, meeting the funding requirements for infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  maintenance  in  the  short  to  medium  term  will  require \nsupplementary funding from the private sector and development partners. \n(v)  Improve  safety  and  enforcement. The Government is aware of the rapidly \ngrowing social and economic costs of poor traffic safety and recognizes that \ninefficient  enforcement  because  of  a  weak  legal  foundation,  inadequate \nresources, and corrupt practices is a root cause of the problem. \n \n ", "24  Appendix 3 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE \n \nTable A3.1: Externally Funded Capital Projects in the Transport Sector in Cambodia \n \nADB  Com-\nLoan  Start  pletion  Value \nNo.  Project Type  Scope  Source  Year  Year  ($ million) \n  Road Rehabilitation  NR 5  Thailand  1992  1993  6.4\n  Emergency Repair  NR 5  UNDP  1992  1993  0.4\n  Bridge Reconstruction  NRs 5, 6  AusAid  1992  1996  9.0\n1199  Road Rehabilitationa  NRs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 11  ADB  1993  1997  67.7\n  Road Rehabilitation  Various  Sida  1993  1997  5.0\n  Road Reconstruction  NR 4  USAID  1994  1996  30.6\n  Road Reconstruction  NRs 6, 7  Japan  1994  1999  109.0\n  Ferry Rehabilitation  NRs 1, 6, 7  Danida  1995  1999  2.5\n1503  Airport Improvement  Siem Reap  ADB  1997  2003  15.0\n  Bridge Construction  NR 7  Japan  1998  2001  53.2\n1659  Road Improvement  NR 1  ADB  1999  2003  50.5\n1824  Emergency Flood Repaira  NRs 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 11,  ADB  2000  2002  65.0\n21, 41 \n1697  Road Rehabilitation  NRs 5, 6, 7  ADB  2000  2003  74.8\n  Read Improvement  NR 6  Japan  2001  2002  10.4\n  Bridge Reconstruction  NR 6  Japan  2001  2002  11.3\n  Road Improvement  NR 7  Japan  2001  2003  15.4\n  Port Modernization  Sihanoukville  Japan  2001  2007  \u2014\n  Emergency Flood Repaira  NR 11  ADB  2002  2003  14.0\n  Road Rehabilitation  NR 51  Japan  2002  2003  5.0\n  Road Rehabilitation  NR 2  Japan  2002  2003  10.0\n  Emergency Flood Repaira  Various  World  2002  2003  50.0\nBank \n  Road Reconstruction  NR 48  Thailand  2002  2004  7.6\n  Road Rehabilitation  NR 3, 6  World  2002  2004  45.0\nBank \n  Road Rehabilitation  NR 51  World  2002  2004  5.0\nBank \n  Road Improvement  NR 1  Japan  2003  2005  31.2\n  Road Reconstruction  NR 48  Thailand  2006  2008  \u2014\n1945  Road Rehabilitation  NRs 5, 6, 56, 68  ADB  2006  2008  60.0\n  Bridge Construction  NR 1  Japan  2007  2009  \u2014\n  Road Maintenance  NRs 33, 56, 68, 72  ADB  2008  2011  \u2014\n\u2014 = not available, ADB = Asian Development Bank, AusAid = Australian Government Overseas Aid Program, Danida \n= Danish Government International Development Aid Programme, NR = national road, Sida = Swedish International \nDevelopment Cooperation Agency, UNDP = United Nations Development Programme. \na These projects included small railway components.

In the medium term, the increased modal diversity would \n(i) provide  competition  to  existing  road  and  sea  transport  that  would  help  increase  their \nefficiency and reduce fares; (ii) reduce wear and tear on the highways, especially national roads \n3, 4, and 5, which run roughly parallel to the railway; and (iii) reduce the incidence of road \naccidents.  In  the  long  term,  reduced  costs  of  transport  would  improve  overall  economic \nefficiency and reduce the cost of living, which would promote increased economic activity, \nleading to additional income and jobs. The monitoring framework and monitoring indicators to \nmeasure these benefits are in Table A10.1. \nTable A10.1: Monitoring Framework: Indicators and Mechanisms \n \nTiming of Benefits or \nOutcomes  Monitoring Indicators  Monitoring Mechanism \nImmediate     \nRailway passenger and freight \nImproved railway transport  traffic \nEffective average train speed  Railway statistics \nNew railway transport services  Railway container traffic \nNew railway transport routes  Railway traffic to Thailand \n \n   \nShort Term (1\u20133 years) \nRoad transport charges on NRs \nShipper surveys \n3, 4, and 5 \nPassenger surveys \nReduced transport costs  Port charges in Sihanoukville \nPublished port tariff for \nSea transport charges between \nSihanoukville \nBangkok and Cambodia \nReduced road maintenance  Share of heavy traffic on NRs 3, \nMPWT traffic counts \nrequirements  4, and 5 \nShare of traffic casualties \nImproved road safety  MPWT accident database \nattributed to NRs 3, 4, and 5 \n \n   \nLong Term (more than 3 years) \nProducer prices as a share of the \nImproved economic efficiency \nvalue of exports   Producer surveys \nProducer or import prices  Price surveys \nReduced cost of living  (including Cambodian taxes) as a  Trade and customs statistics \nshare of domestic market prices \nMPWT = Ministry of Public Works and Transport, NR = national road. \n2.  Monitoring of long-term benefits will focus on products moved by the railway, which are \nexpected to include fuel, cement, and containerized cargoes (especially textiles and apparel). \nMonitoring will be implemented by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT). To the \nextent available, baseline values for the indicators are in Table A10.2, and will be further \nupdated by the MPWT, where necessary. The MPWT will measure the indicators for project \nevaluation at project inception, completion, and annually for 5 years after completion. The \nMPWT will hire an independent, qualified institute for surveys, analysis, and reporting. The \npreliminary estimate for the cost of monitoring is $70,000.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national   Yes  Is the sector identified as a   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?    national priority in country poverty   \n   No  partnership agreement?    No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \n \nThe total population of Cambodia is approximately 13 million, of whom about one third live in poverty. \nMuch of the country\u2019s infrastructure was destroyed during decades of civil war and conflict, and its \nsocioeconomic indicators are relatively low. Poverty is overwhelmingly rural: 40\u201345% of people in rural \nareas are poor, compared with 10\u201315% in Phnom Penh. The incidence of poverty has declined only \nmodestly in recent years for a number of reasons, including a shortage of sources of growth and exclusion \nof the poor from the mainstream economy. \n \nImproving  Cambodia\u2019s  basic  infrastructure  is  critical  for  the  country\u2019s  economic  development,  and \nCambodia has started a process of infrastructure rehabilitation with support from its development partners. \nThe Government-owned railway is in poor physical condition because of war damage and decades of \ninsufficient maintenance and investment and rail traffic is declining because of the poor condition of the \ntracks. As a result, the railway is generating operational deficits. The purpose of the Project is to restore \nefficient rail traffic by rehabilitating the existing railway line, reestablishing Cambodia\u2019s rail connection with \nThailand by replacing a section to the border that was destroyed, and restructuring the railway subsector. \nRehabilitation of the railway will foster efficient rail freight service. It is expected that the proposed Project \nwill facilitate economic growth by providing a cost-effective and efficient means of transporting goods, as \nan efficient transport system would increase trade and employment opportunities. The Project will also \nfacilitate subregional trade and economic growth in Cambodia and Thailand.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nFollowing the Asian Development Bank\u2019s enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy (1999), projects classified \nas general interventions no longer require project-level poverty assessments. The resettlement plan \nincludes compensation, resettlement, and livelihood restoration for households affected by land acquisition \nand displacement to restore and improve their incomes and living standards. Poverty in the vicinity of the \nproject could give rise to human trafficking, and an established network for human trafficking is known to \nexist in Poipet and on the Thai side of the border. Migrants into Poipet come primarily from Battambang, \nBanteay, Kampong Tom, Kandal, Meanchey, Prey Veng, and Siem Reap, and those who cannot find jobs \nbecome easy prey for the human traffickers. Thus the Project will include an awareness program on \nhuman trafficking and safe migration. The social assessment indicates that the community in the Poipet \narea has identified drug use as a problem. An HIV/AIDS awareness campaign will address the potential \nrisk of infection during the construction phase for both workers and communities. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes\n   No\n \nDuring preparation of the proposed Project, meetings were held with various stakeholders, government \nofficials,  and  member  of  affected communities.  Rapid social appraisal  was conducted  with  affected \ncommunities  to  discuss  Project-related  resettlement  issues.  In-depth  stakeholder  analysis  will  be \nconducted with members of affected households, business owners, and government officials during \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plan.  The  stakeholders\u2019  workshop  will  cover  issues  related  to \nresettlement site selection, compensation, relocation, land acquisition, etc. \n \n ", "44   Appendix 11 \nIs there a participation strategy?   Yes\n   No \n \nThe resettlement plan will include a number of steps to ensure involvement by affected households, \nbusiness owners, and government officials in resettlement committees at the district and commune levels. \nThe consultation process for resettlement site selection and land acquisition will include a participatory \nstrategy for active participation by affected households and business owners. Capacity-building programs \nfor affected households will raise their awareness of resettlement issues and compensation so that those \naffected can negotiate fair compensation for losses of property, assets, businesses, etc. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  \n \nThe Project\u2019s gender analysis includes households affected by land acquisition, displacement, loss of \nbusiness, and railway subsector restructuring. The acquisition of land in Poipet on the Cambodia\u2013Thai \nborder to reconstruct destroyed track will require the displacement of a large number of squatters living on \nrailway land. In addition, land acquisition will be required for the Southern and Northern lines. Squatter \nhouseholds living on railway land, including women, are engaged in various informal sector economic \nactivities. The men are mainly engaged in push cart pulling to transport goods and in providing motorbike \ntransportation for people traveling across the border. Men also work as a wage laborers. The women are \nengaged in petty trading, running small restaurants and other small enterprises (such as beauty salons, \ngrocery shops, and tailoring establishments), and piece rate work for garment factories and provide a \nsignificant portion of their households\u2019 income. As a result, in 90% of squatter households, women control \nthe households\u2019 incomes and expenditures. Half of squatter households belong to poor and vulnerable \ngroups, and their relocation will have a significant impact on their livelihood activities. Poor female-headed \nhouseholds account for 22.3% of affected households. In addition, the restructuring of the railway will \naffect the job security of the railway\u2019s employees. As part of the restructuring, women railways employees \nmight lose their jobs. \n \nCommunities in the project sites could face an increased risk of HIV/AIDS because of the influx of \nconstruction workers. The trafficking of girls across the border is a recognized issue in Poipet. An \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness program for the affected communities will be developed and \nimplemented  during  project  implementation.  Construction  contracts  will  include  community-based \nprevention programs for their workers.  \n \nIn the squatter settlements and in the affected communes and villages, separate consultation workshops \non resettlement planning related to resettlement sites, compensation, and improvement of livelihoods will \nbe  conducted  for  men  and  women  from  affected  households.  These  workshops  will  emphasize \nparticipation by women from female-headed households and ethnic minority groups (Vietnamese and \nChinese ethnic groups each account for 0.4% of those affected) to identify specific issues related to \nwomen\u2019s income-earning activities that will be affected by relocation and land acquisition. \n \nBoth  men  and  women  from  affected  households  will  participate  in  discussions  of  the  detailed \nmeasurement  survey  of  losses,  the  district  resettlement  working  groups  will  include  district  women \nofficials,  and  the  commune-level  resettlement  committees  will  include  women  representatives  from \naffected households. \n \nDuring the inception phase of the Project, a capacity-building program on resettlement activities will be \ndesigned for women and men from affected households. Emphasis will be given to including trainees from \nfemale-headed households and ethnic minority households. The training will include commune- and \ndistrict-level women officials and district and commune resettlement committee members. The objective of \nthe training is to provide detailed information about resettlement activities, such as proposed sites, \nentitlements, livelihood strategies for income restoration or improvement, grievance procedures, etc. \n \nThe relocation of squatters in the resettlement sites will take into account women\u2019s work in the informal \n ", "    Appendix 11  45 \nsector. The compensation plan and livelihood restoration or improvement strategies will ensure that \nwomen can maintain their current income-earning activities and access to markets.  \n \nIn relation to relocation, compensation, and livelihood improvement activities, special consideration will be \ngiven to poor female-headed households and ethnic minority households.  \n \nThe resettlement plan will include joint registration of land rights in the names of both husbands and wives \nfor replacement land. \n \nWomen railway staff affected by the railway restructuring will be included in counseling and retraining \nprograms, vocational training, and so on as necessary for securing employment opportunities. \n \nSpecific attention will be paid to complaints and grievances by women, ethnic minorities, and poor \nhouseholds.  \n \nThe HIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness program will include women leaders and youth from the \naffected households from squatter settlements, district women officials, and women health workers. The \nprogram will be coordinated with established nongovernment organization programs in the Poipet and \nNorthern and Southern line areas of the Project. \n \nIn  line  with  the  Labor  Code  (1997),  all  employment  for  the  Project  will  conform  to    Government \ncommitments to gender equity, including the provision of equal pay and benefits for work of equal value. In \naddition, no child labor or trafficked labor will be used. \n \nMonitoring indicators disaggregated by gender and ethnic group will be developed to monitor resettlement \nactivities. \n \nGender  sensitization  training  will  be  provided  for  relevant  staff  from  the  executing  agency,  district \nresettlement working groups, and district women officials and commune leaders. \n \nA social development and gender specialist (national consultant) will be recruited for 8 months to prepare \na gender action plan to operationalize the gender strategy. The gender specialist will coordinate with the \nresettlement specialist to prepare the action plan. \n \nHas an output been prepared?   Yes \n   No \n \n ", "46   Appendix 11 \n \n \nE.

Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n1.  To minimize the impacts of resettlement, the corridor of impact1 established for the \nrehabilitation of the entire railway line is 3.5 meters on either side of the track centerline.2 In \naddition, the area required for the station in Poipet has been reduced from 6 hectares to 3 \nhectares. \n \n2.  About 2,629 people will be affected by the railway rehabilitation as follows: (i) 965 \nhouseholds whose structures will be affected, of which 822 households will be severely affected \nand 143 households will be marginally affected and all of whom may be physically displaced \nbecause of impacts on their houses and/or shops; (ii) 1,660 households who will experience \nminor impacts from the loss of secondary structures (wells, fences, etc.) and trees, and whose \nmain place of residence or business will not be affected; (iii) 3 privately-owned permanent \nbusinesses structures and one public owned building will be disrupted because of impacts on \nstructures and may require relocation. \n3.  In addition, bamboo rail transport operators will lose their source of livelihood once the \nrailway lines have been rehabilitated. Currently 189 operators are operating along the entire \nline.  \nB.  Policy Framework, Principles, and Entitlements \n4.  The legal and policy framework for compensation and resettlement under the Project is \ndefined by the relevant laws and regulations of the Government of Cambodia and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) policies on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), Indigenous Peoples \n(1998),  Gender  and  Development  (2006),  Accountability  Mechanism  (2003),  and  Public \nCommunications  (2005).  In  the  case  of  discrepancies  between  the  Government\u2019s  laws, \nregulations,  and  procedures  and  ADB's  policies  and  requirements,  ADB's  policies  and \nrequirements will prevail. \n5.  As none of the affected persons identified within the railway corridor of impact and living \ninside railway stations have legal documents to indicate rights to occupancy, the Government \nviews them as illegal settlers or squatters, and they cannot be compensated for the land they \nare currently occupying. However, their lack of legal status does not bar them from receiving \nproject entitlements, and the Project will ensure that all affected persons, irrespective of their \ntenure status, will be assisted to restore or improve their preproject socioeconomic conditions. \n1.  Income Restoration and Resettlement Strategy \n6.  The relocation of people away from the railway would affect their incomes if they have to \nmove away from their current sources of livelihood, thus relocation will be minimized. Affected \npersons  that  have  to  relocate  will  participate  in  identifying  and  selecting  options  with \nGovernment assistance (i) to reorganize themselves within the remaining right-of-way so that \nthey can continue their businesses or employment for at least the next 5 years; (ii) to move \noutside the right-of-way to either group or individual relocation sites close to (5 kilometers or \nless) their current locations so that their incomes will not be affected; or (iii) to receive cash \n                                                 \n1  This is the area within the right-of-way that will be permanently cleared for the Project. \n2   Government Order No. 6, dated 27 September 1999, sets the right-of-way for railway lines to 20 meters each side \nof the centerline of the track in densely populated areas, 30 meters each side of the centerline outside cities, and \n100 meters each side of the centerline for mountainous areas where there are rock falls or tall forests. \n ", "48   Appendix 12 \nassistance for the loss of land use and make their own arrangements for relocation. Community \nmeetings held in June 2006 indicate that a number of affected persons are open to being \nrelocated off-site for an opportunity to own land of their own. Possible suitable replacement sites \n(privately-owned open land) were identified during the planning process. These sites will be \nfurther explored and finalized during project planning in consultation with the affected persons. \nBamboo rail transport operators will have to give up their operations upon the commencement \nof  railway  civil  works,  but  will  be  helped  to  develop  other  means  of  transport  for  making \ncomparable incomes. Thus income levels will generally be maintained or restored. \n2.  Participation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n7.  Consultations, public meetings, and village discussions with affected persons and local \nofficials were carried out during the resettlement planning process. These activities will continue \nduring updating of the Resettlement Plan  and implementation and will follow the Project\u2019s \nparticipatory approach. A public information booklet has been finalized and translated into \nKhmer and will be distributed to affected persons and posted in commune offices before the \nADB Staff Review Committee meeting. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) will \nbe responsible for disclosing the draft and final resettlement plans to the affected persons. ADB \nwill include the draft and final resettlement plans on its resettlement web site. A grievance \nmechanism has been designed to ensure that affected persons\u2019 concerns and grievances are \naddressed and resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner. Affected persons will be made fully \naware of their rights verbally and in writing during consultation. ADB\u2019s Accountability Mechanism \n(2003) Policy field guide has been translated into Khmer and will be distributed to affected \npersons together with the public information booklet. \n3.  Ethnic Minorities and Gender Strategy \n8.  The Project does not expect to have specific impacts on ethnic minority groups and does \nnot require the preparation of an ethnic minority development plan. However, the resettlement \nplan  and  the  gender  strategy  do  include specific  actions  to  mitigate  adverse  impacts  and \nenhance the ability of the few ethnic minorities (Chinese and Vietnamese) and other vulnerable \ngroups  to  benefit  from  the  project  interventions.  A  gender  strategy  is  included  in  the \nresettlement  plan  to  enhance  opportunities  for  women\u2019s  participation  in  all  aspects  of  the \nProject, from planning to implementation; participate in the decision-making process; and take \nadvantage of new employment and income-generating opportunities. The project supervision \nconsultants and the independent monitoring organization will ensure that they or members of \ntheir teams have experience in preparing and implementing gender and development programs \nin Cambodia, the necessary gender perspective and experience to deal with vulnerable groups, \nand female staff. \nC.  Institutional Arrangements and Implementation Schedule \n9.  The MPWT, under the guidance of the Interministerial Resettlement Committee of the \nMinistry of Economy and Finance, will be responsible for updating, implementing, and internal \nmonitoring  of  resettlement  activities  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  requirements. \nConsultants will be engaged for the purposes of both supervision and capacity building to \nensure  the  effective  updating  and  implementation  of  resettlement  activities.  The  project \nsupervision consultants will consist of one international resettlement specialist, one national \nresettlement specialist, and one national gender specialist. \n10.  The resettlement plan will be updated on a section-by-section basis following detailed \ndesign. It will be disclosed to affected persons prior to submission to ADB for review and \n ", "    Appendix 12  49 \napproval. In instances where no land acquisition and resettlement is called for, the civil works \ncontractors will be issued a notice of possession of sites only after the project implementation \nteam, together with the Project\u2019s resettlement consultants, has confirmed that the area will not \ncause any resettlement impacts and that the land is free of any encumbrances, disputes, or \ncontroversies. Where resettlement impacts cannot be avoided, civil works contractors will be \nissued a notice of possession only after (i) the compensation payment and relocation to new \nsites have been satisfactorily completed in that particular section of railway, (ii) the agreed \nrehabilitation assistance is in place, and (iii) the particular section is free from all encumbrances. \nLand acquisition, compensation, and relocation of affected persons cannot commence until ADB \nhas  approved  the  updated  resettlement  plan.  To  ensure  that  temporary  impacts  during \nconstruction will be minimized if they cannot be avoided, the civil works contracts will have the \nfollowing requirements: (i) the contractor will pay rent for any land required for construction \nworking space, (ii) the contractor will employ unused land for working space to the extent \npossible  to  avoid  disruptions  to  households  and  business  establishments  and  the  use  of \nresidential land will not require any impacts on houses and structures and will not disrupt \nhouseholds\u2019 access, and (iii) the land that has been used temporarily will be restored to its \npreproject condition or improved. \n1.  Monitoring \n11.  The MPWT will be responsible for internal monitoring of resettlement activities. Progress \nreports will be submitted to ADB on a quarterly basis. An independent monitoring agency will be \nidentified, recruited, and mobilized before the commencement of any resettlement activities, \nincluding the detailed measurement survey of losses. The agency will be required to submit \nperiodic reports on the progress of implementation and make any necessary recommendations \nregarding issues identified. \n2.  Cost Estimates \n12.  On-site relocation is estimated to cost $2.8 million and off-site relocation is estimated to \ncost $3.8 million. This includes compensation and allowances to affected persons, development \nof resettlement sites, income restoration programs, operational and administration expenses, \ninternal and external monitoring, and contingencies. The costs are estimates and may change \nupon  completion  of  the  detailed  measurement  survey  to  determine  actual  impacts.  The \nGovernment will ensure timely provision of counterpart funds for resettlement and will meet any \nunforeseen  obligations  in  excess  of  the  resettlement  plan  budget  estimates  to  satisfy \nresettlement objectives. \n \n ", "50   Appendix 13 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n1.  The financial statements for the Project were prepared in current terms for a period of 30 \nyears. Rehabilitation of the railways will be completed in December 2009. The foreign and \ndomestic inflation rates are assumed to be 2% and 4%, respectively, during the projection \nperiod. \n \n2.  Railway traffic was forecast within the context of a medium economic growth scenario of \n3.5% per year from 2006 to 2020 and 5.0% per year from 2020. The forecasting methodology \nincluded a review of historical patterns of container and freight traffic (particularly of cement and \npetroleum products), with distinctions made between the Northern and Southern lines, and a \nreview of competition from improving road conditions (such as completion of the rehabilitation of \nNational Road 5). \n \n3.  Some of the enabling conditions for increased rail traffic are assumed as follows: (i) the \nrehabilitation of both the Northern and Southern lines and the reconstruction of the Poipet \ndestroyed  link  are  completed  in  2009;  (ii)  a  commercial  public\u2013private  partnership  railway \noperator will be in position to offer reliable and efficient services; (iii) the new cement factory in \nKampot province will start operations in 2009 at the latest, initiating local cement production to \nbe  distributed  in  the  domestic  market,  and  thereby  modifying  the  transportation pattern  of \ncement in Cambodia;  and (iv) the cross-border agreement between Thailand and Cambodia is \nsigned and in effect when the railway in Cambodia is reconnected to that in Thailand. \n \n4.  The underlying assumptions considered in relation to the development of new freight \nrates are (i) when trucking and railway services are in competition, total transport costs using \nrailway services should be 20% cheaper (i.e., rail tariff rates are 80% of the alternative cost of \nusing roads); and (ii) freight rates along the Northern Line should be close to the rates charged \nby the State Railway of Thailand.

Twenty-one  percent  of  the  Project\u2019s  costs  will  be  funded  by  the  Government  of \nCambodia, 4% by a grant for rails (in kind) from the Government of Malaysia, and the balance of \n75% through concessionary foreign-denominated loans from the Asian Development Bank and \nthe OPEC Fund for International Development. The Asian Development Bank loan will have a \n32-year maturity, including, an 8-year grace period. Interest will be at 1.0% per year during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per year over the remaining term of the loan. The OPEC Fund for \nInternational Development loan will be repayable over a 20-year maturity tenor, including a 5-\nyear grace period, a fixed interest rate of 1.0%, and a 1.0% fixed service charge. \n \n6.  All financial analysis calculations are in real terms, based on mid-2006 prices, and cover \nthe period 2007\u20132036. Capital costs include all incremental capital expenditures related to the \n ", "    Appendix 13  51 \nrehabilitation of the railway, but exclude price contingencies and interest during construction. \nThe analysis and financial projections were carried out on an incremental consolidated basis. \n \n7.  The estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the Project, after taxes in \nreal terms, was calculated using the respective weighted cost of funds. The cost of debt has \nbeen adjusted to reflect the impact of the corporate profit tax of 20%. The nominal cost of \nfunding is converted to the real cost by applying domestic and international average inflation \nrates for local currency and foreign currency funding, respectively. \n \n8.  The analysis shows that the Project is financially viable. The real after-tax financial \ninternal rate of return (FIRR) is 10.2 %. The FIRR compares favorably to the real after-tax \nWACC of 4.1%. The estimated net present value of the net cash flows using the WACC as the \nhurdle rate is $65.7 million. Sensitivity analysis shows that the Project remains robust when run-\non scenarios, such as a 1-year delay in commencing operations, a 10% increase in investment \ncosts, and a 10% increase in operating costs, are applied. The FIRR calculation was most \nsensitive to a 10% increase in operating costs, which resulted in an estimated FIRR of 6.5%. \nEven  if  the  foregoing  sensitivity  scenarios  are  all  combined,  the  FIRR  remains  at  5.4%, \nremaining above the WACC of 4.1%.

Objectives and Scope  \n1.  The  economic  analysis  establishes  the  net  benefits  flowing  from  the  Project  by \ncomparing cost and benefits with and without rehabilitation of the existing railway network and \nrestoration of the railway connection with Thailand. The analysis is based on the demand \nforecast  and  economic  analysis  developed  by  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \n(footnote  9)  and  assumes  that  the  railway  is  restructured.  The  Project  has  three  main \ncomponents:  rehabilitation  of  the  Southern  Line  between  Phnom  Penh  and  Sihanoukville, \nrehabilitation of the currently operating section of the Northern Line between Phnom Penh and \nSisophon, and reconstruction of the currently nonoperating destroyed link of the Northern Line \nbetween Sisophon and Poipet on the border with Thailand. The two sections of the Northern \nLine are treated as one in the economic analysis, as neither would be viable without the other. \n2.  Shadow prices have been applied at border prices1 for all tradable items, such as rolling \nstock,  track,  construction  materials,  and  maintenance  equipment,  and  at  resource  cost  for \nnontradable items, such as labor. All prices are fixed at their 2006 levels. The without project \ncase  against  which  the  Project\u2019s  benefits  and  costs  are  measured  is  defined  as  the  no \ninvestment  case  and  involves  the  gradual  rundown  of  the  railway\u2019s  infrastructure  and  the \nimposition of increasingly more severe speed restrictions. This would lead to an accelerated \ndiversion of traffic to road transport and to the eventual inoperability of the railway. Specifically, \nit is forecast that freight services on the Northern Line would cease by 2015 and on the \nSouthern Line by 2020. The remaining passenger service is expected to decline much more \nrapidly, given that railway passenger volumes have been falling at an average rate of nearly \n27%  per  year  since  1998.  Accordingly,  it  is  assumed  that  without  the  Project,  passenger \nservices would cease by the end of 2010. \nB.  Traffic Demand Forecast \n3.  The forecasts for future railway traffic are in Table A14.1, which provides independent \nforecasts  for  principal  freight  types  and  for  passengers  distributed  by  railway  line.  Two \nalternative growth scenarios are considered: the without project case, for which negative growth \nis expected, reflecting progressive deterioration of the railway, and the with project case, which \nassumes moderate (3.5\u20145.0%) economic growth. The  with project scenario assumes that \nfuture economic growth in Cambodia will be at a level comparable to that experienced in recent \nyears. The with project traffic forecasts take into account (i) container traffic diverting to the \nrailway from road and sea transport; and (ii) changes in the transport patterns for cement when \nthree new cement plants in Kampot province (one planned and two under construction) become \noperational, which is expected to occur in 2008 or 2009. \n                                                 \n1  Consisting of cargo value, insurance during transport, and cost of freight transport to the Cambodian border, \nreferred to as the cargo, insurance, and freight price. \n ", "54   Appendix 14 \nTable A14.1  Traffic Forecast , Selected Years \n(million ton-km or passenger-km)  \n \nRailway  Cur-\nConstruction Period  Benefit Period \nLine and  Type of  rent \nCase  Traffic  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2015  2020  2030 \nSouthern  Cement  10.8  9.2  6.7  4.9  1.5  1.5  0.9  0.0 \nLine without  Petroleum  18.5  19.2  20.0  20.8  19.7  23.9  32.7  0.0 \nProject  Containers  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0 \nTotal freight  29.3  28.5  26.7  25.7  21.2  25.4  33.6  0.0 \nPassengers  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0 \nSouthern  Cementa  10.8  41.6  165.4  316.4  393.4  541.5  699.1  874.2 \nLine with  Petroleum  18.5  19.2  25.3  39.6  50.4  63.2  98.2  119.5 \nProject  Containers  0  0  0  0  52.9  133.2  155.7  244.5 \nTotal freight  29.3  60.8  190.7  355.9  496.7  737.9  953.0  1238.2 \nPassengers  0  0  0  0  6.2  21.3  37.3  97.6 \nNorthern  Cement  88.3  83.4  74.4  63.7  51.1  0.0  0.0  0.0 \nLine without  Petroleum  2.8  2.9  3.1  3.2  3.3  3.5  0.0  0.0 \nProject  Containers  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0 \nTotal freight  91.2  86.4  77.4  66.9  54.4  3.5  0.0  0.0 \nPassengers  3.5  2.3  1.4  0.8  0.5  0.0  0.0  0.0 \nNorthern  Cement  88.3  75.84  9.96  2.14  1.97  2.28  14.82  51.18 \nLine with  Petroleum  2.8  2.9  3.1  3.2  8.4  11.6  15.9  19.4 \nProject  Containers  0.0  0.0  0.0  0.0  72.2  115.5  184.8  301.0 \nTotal freight  91.2  78.7  13.1  5.3  82.6  129.4  215.5  371.6 \nPassengers  3.5  2.3  1.4  0.8  12.1  55.4  92.2  236.0 \na  Also includes coal, gypsum, and other imported inputs for cement production that are transported by rail. \nSource: JARTS, Nippon Koei Co.

The financial project investment cost estimate includes import duties (at a rate of 25% \nfor cement and structural steel) and value-added tax at the rate of 10%. Wages are considered \nto be market determined, and so do not require shadow price adjustment. Similarly, the costs of \nresettlement and compensation are assumed to represent fair market value and are not shadow \nprice adjusted. Based on the split between materials and labor costs in the detailed construction \ncost  estimate,  weighted  shadow  pricing  factors  have  been  estimated  for  each  project \ncomponent as follows: the Southern Line, 0.77; the Northern Line not including the destroyed \nlink, 0.85; and the destroyed link, 0.79.

In the with project case, continued operation of the railway and growing future traffic \nrequire future investment in additional locomotives and wagons. The estimated economic prices \nof acquiring and maintaining rolling stock are shown in Table A17.3. Investments requirements \nfor locomotives and rolling stock are estimated explicitly by forecasting fleet requirements from \nforecast traffic volumes. Independent forecasts were prepared for the Southern and Northern \nlines based on the assumed annual traffic capability per wagon, which reflects the payload of \nthe  equipment  and  its  average  cycle  times  on  the  respective  railway  lines.  Improved \nmanagement practices are assumed to improve future equipment utilization rates compared \nwith the current situation. Existing operable rolling stock has been deducted from gross fleet \nrequirements to arrive at net investment requirements. The acquisition of locomotives and \nwagons is phased in line with traffic growth. Asset lives are assumed to be 25 years for \nlocomotives and 20 years for wagons.  \n \nTable A14.3:  Acquisition and Annual Maintenance Costs  \nfor Locomotives and Rolling Stock  \n(economic cost in $/unit) \n \nCargo, Insurance, and Freight \nItem  Border Price  Annual Maintenance Costs \nLocomotive  1,000,000   24,000 \nPassenger Coach   350,000   7,000 \nContainer Flat Wagon   40,000   800 \nCement Hopper   40,000   800 \nPetroleum Tanker Wagon   60,000   1,200 \nSource: JARTS, Nippon Koei Co.

Variable railway operating and maintenance costs encompass train crews, fuel, rolling \nstock maintenance, track maintenance, and station staffing. The economic price of diesel fuel is \nestimated using the price for Brent crude as of 3 May 2006 ($75.68 per barrel or $566.47 per \nton), with the addition of refining and transportation costs of $78 per ton, giving a border price of \n$644.46 per ton or $0.542 per liter. Track maintenance costs consist of materials, which have \nbeen shadow price adjusted to reflect border prices, and labor costs, which are assumed to be \nmarket  determined.  The  resulting  economic  cost  estimates  are  in  Table  A14.4.

Transport cost savings resulting from the diversion of traffic to the railway are calculated \nas the long-term marginal costs of transport by road and by sea, as applicable, including the \ndepreciation costs of vehicles and vessels. The calculated unit costs of road and sea transport \nfor relevant routes and types of traffic are shown in Table A14.5. Road vehicle cost estimates \nare based on a recent survey of motor vehicle dealers in Phnom Penh conducted by the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency as part of its feasibility study for the Second Mekong Bridge \nProject. Including fuel savings, the net savings in road and sea transport costs account for about \n91% of measured total project benefits. \n ", "    Appendix 14  57 \nTable A14.5: Long-Term Marginal Operating Costs for  \nRoad and Sea Transport, Excluding Fuel Costs \n \nCosts \nTraffic and Main Directiona  Road  Sea \nExisting  Passengers:  Phnom Penh to Battambang ($ per passenger-km)  0.0147   \nRailway  Cement: Sisophon to Phnom Penh ($ per ton-km)  0.0147   \nTraffic  Petroleum: Sihanoukville to Phnom Penh ($ per ton-km)  0.0176   \nFuture  Containers: Sihanoukville to Phnom Penh ($ per ton-km)  0.0252   \nTraffic  Containers: Laem Chabang to Phnom Penh ($ per ton-km)    0.0067 \nDiverted  Cement: Kampot to Phnom Penh ($ per ton-km)  0.0201   \nfrom Road  Cement: Thailand to Battambang ($ per ton-km)  0.0138   \nand Sea  Cement: Sisophon to Phnom Penh ($ per ton-km)  0.0147   \nPetroleum: Sihanoukville to Phnom Penh ($ per ton-km)  0.0176   \nPetroleum: Phnom Penh to Battambang ($ per ton-km)  0.0173   \nPassengers: Phnom Penh to Poipet ($ per passenger-km)  0.0104   \nSource: JARTS, Nippon Koei Co.

Other benefits arising from the diversion of heavy traffic from road to rail that have been \nevaluated are (i) reduced fuel consumption, because railway traffic is more fuel-efficient than \nroad traffic, resulting in savings in carbon dioxide emissions (the value of reduced emissions \nhas been estimated from the prevailing price of carbon certificates in the world market and the \nbenefits from Project-related emissions savings account for about 3% of total project benefits); \n(ii) reduced costs of future road maintenance, which account for about 4% of total project \nbenefits; and (iii) reduced incidence of road accidents, 2 which accounts for about 3% of total \nproject benefits. Offsetting increases in railway accident costs resulting from increased railway \ntraffic are considered negligible and were not estimated. \n9.  Savings  in  travel  times  and  inventory  costs  are  ignored  for  the  following  reasons: \n(i) current railway users would experience a significant improvement in speed, but their share of \ntotal transport is marginal, and the corresponding savings are therefore negligible; (ii) new \nrailway users switching from road transport would not experience an improvement in speed, \nbecause the rehabilitated railway will offer travel speeds that are generally slower, or at best \nequal to, road speeds; and (iii) existing road users who continue to use road transport following \nrehabilitation of the railway will not experience a major improvement in speed, because road \ntraffic generally is light in Cambodia, thus a reduction in road traffic resulting from a diversion of \ntraffic to the railway will have little or no impact on average road travel speeds. \nE.  Results \n10.  Summary  results  of  the  economic  analysis  are  in  Table  A14.6.  Two  cases  are \nconsidered: with and without future passenger services. The estimated economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) for the Project is 25.8% without passenger services and slightly lower, 24.9%, \nwith passenger services. These results reflect that passenger services are economically viable \non the Northern Line only. The EIRR for the Southern Line is higher than total project returns \nwhile the EIRR for the Northern Line is lower but still well above the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \ncutoff rate of 12%.

The sensitivity of the  Project\u2019s EIRR to assumptions and forecasts was assessed by \nvarying selected sensitivity parameters to reasonable alternative values and by calculating their \nswitching values, which is the percentage change of the variable that makes the project just viable. \nThe sensitivity test parameters were chosen to reflect the identified uncertainties in the project: \n(i) possible  failure  to  reconnect  with  the  railway  in  Thailand;  (ii) forecast  demand  for  railway \ntransport,  especially  the  schedule  for  bringing  the  planned  new  cement  factories  in  Kampot \nProvince into operation; (iii) the efficiency of the future railway operator; (iv) the future price for oil \nwhich has been volatile in recent years and (v) possible higher Project implementation cost if yet \nunidentified weaknesses in the existing railway infrastructure are identified during detailed design. \nThe results are in Table A14.7 \nTable A14.8: Sensitivity Tests \n \nSensitivity \nEIRR  Switching Value \nItem  (%)  (% change) \nInvestment  Project Investment Cost increased by 20%  23.0  311% \nProject completion delayed by one year  24.3 \n9-10 years \nProject completion delayed by two years  22.9 \nRailway  Operating cost increased by 50%  20.2  128% \nOperations \nBrent Crude prices reduced to $50 per barrel (-30%)  20.5  -83% \nCost \nOperations with Thailand  not reestablished  19.7  \u2014 \nBenefits  Transport benefits reduced by 15%  20.7  -43% \nTraffic demand reduced by 20%  21.0  -47% \n\u2014 = not applicable; EIRR = economic internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and JARTS, Nippon Koei Co.

The Project has been subjected to risk analysis involving all the variables tested in the \nsensitivity analysis. The risk analysis shows about 96% probability that the project will achieve an \nEIRR of 12% or more. \n13.  Measures to avoid or limit loss of potential economic benefits are integral to the project \ndesign and the implementation schedule: (i) restructuring of the railway and introduction of a \ncommercial, private sector railway operator to ensure efficiency in operation and minimize the risk \nof  not  realizing  economic  benefits  that  are  commercially  viable;  (ii) introduction  of  explicit \nGovernment  subsidies  for  public  service  obligation  passenger  traffic  to  enable  realization  of \neconomically  viable  but  commercially  unviable  passenger  traffic;  (iii) scheduling  of  project \nimplementation to ensure that sections with high economic and financial potential are rehabilitated \nfirst  and  (iv) assurances  by  the  Government  that  negotiations  with  Thailand  concerning \nreestablishing the railway border crossing and reconnecting to the railway in Thailand have started \nand are expected to be concluded prior to loan effectiveness. \nG.  Distribution of Project Benefits \n14.  One third of Cambodians fall below the poverty line and 90% of the poor live in rural areas. \nThe flow of project benefits to the poor includes (i) direct benefits from reduced personal transport \ncosts, (ii) indirect benefits from lower costs of transport for staple commodities, and (iii) induced \neconomic activity that could create additional income generation and employment opportunities. \n ", "    Appendix 14  61 \n \nThe bulk of benefits to the poor would be reductions in the costs of transporting people and staple \ncommodities, which has a direct impact on the cost of living, and increased trade that would \ncontribute to faster economic growth, which is a strong catalyst for overall poverty reduction. \nH.  Subsidy Requirements for Passenger Services \n15.  The economic analysis shows that passenger railway services are economically viable but, \nas discussed later, maintaining passenger services in the future will require a significant subsidy \nfrom the Government. \n16.  Between 1998 and 2005, the number of passengers carried by rail declined at an average \nrate of about 27% per year. The decline was fastest on the Southern Line, where passenger \nservices effectively ceased in late 2003, and shortly thereafter, the frequency of passenger trains \non the Northern Line was reduced to one train in each direction per week. By 2005, the number of \npassengers carried had declined to 48,000. The bulk of remaining passenger trips are on the \nsection between Phnom Penh and Pursat, where the railway serves small communities that are \nremote from the primary road system. The fall in passenger trips coincides with (i) progressive \nimprovement of national roads 3, 4, and 5, which run roughly parallel to the railway; (ii) rapid \ndevelopment  of  frequent,  reliable,  and  increasingly  comfortable  public  transport  services  that \nrange  from  relatively  expensive  air-conditioned  buses  to  relatively  cheap  minibuses;  and \n(iii) progressively reduced travel speeds and service levels on the railway. The railway\u2019s loss of \npassengers has occurred even though railway fares are considerably cheaper than competing \nminibus services, which suggests that travel time and frequency of service may be more important \nthan price in influencing passengers\u2019 modal choice. \n17.  The subsidy requirements for maintaining railway passenger traffic in the future have been \nanalyzed  under  the  following  key  assumptions:  (i) future  passenger  services  will  provide  a \nminimum of one train departure per day in each direction on both lines; (ii) departure frequency will \nincrease  when  future  passenger  demand  justifies  it;  and  (iii) railway  passenger  fares  will  be \ncompetitive with road transport. The results are shown in Table A14.9 and indicate that ticket \nrevenues from competitively priced passenger traffic could cover about 50% of operating and \ncapital costs attributable to passenger traffic, resulting in an annual revenue shortfall of $0.6 \nmillion in the first year of operation, increasing to $3.1 million in 2030. Projected deficits accelerate \nafter 2020, when increasing passenger demand leads to increased train frequencies, first on the \nNorthern Line and later on the Southern Line. \n ", "62  Appendix 14 \nTable A14.9: Projected Revenues and Expenses from  \nTable A14.9: Railway Passenger Operations \n(Market Prices, Selected Years) \n \nLine  Item  2010  2015  2020  2025  2030 \nSouthern  Passengers (\u2019000)  47.0  120.0  205.0  356.0  507.0 \nPassenger-km (millions)  6.2  21.3  37.3  67.5  97.6 \nRevenues ($ million)  0.1  0.2  0.4  0.7  1.0 \nExpenditures ($ million)  0.3  0.4  0.7  1.1  1.8 \nDeficit ($ million)  0.2  0.2  0.3  0.4  0.8 \nNorthern  Passengers (\u2019000)  92.0  296.0  456.0  769.0  1,081.0 \nPassenger-km (millions)  12.1  55.4  92.2  164.1  236.0 \nRevenues ($ million)  0.1  0.6  0.9  1.6  2.2 \nExpenditures ($ million)  0.5  1.3  1.7  3.2  4.5 \nDeficit ($ million)  0.4  0.7  0.8  1.6  2.3 \nTotal  Passengers (\u2019000)  140.0  416.0  661.0  1,125.0  1,588.0 \nPassenger-km (millions)  18.3  76.7  129.5  231.6  333.7 \nRevenues ($ million)  0.2  0.8  1.3  2.3  3.2 \nExpenditures ($ million)  0.8  1.8  2.4  4.3  6.3 \nDeficit ($ million)  0.6  1.0  1.1  2.0  3.1 \nSource:  JARTS,  Nippon  Koei  Co.
