Justification \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to assist the Shanxi Provincial Government (SPG) in preparing the \nShanxi Inclusive Agricultural Value Chain Development Project, which is included in ADB\u2019s \nlending program for 2018. Although the SPG has experience with ADB\u2019s project preparation, it \nis necessary to provide a project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) to help the SPG \nprepare the project in compliance with ADB\u2019s requirements and with international practices in \nthe design. \n2.  To strengthen the project design and cater for the SPG\u2019s request, in addition to the \nPPTA, ADB will provide technical assistance support for inclusive business (IB) approach1 \n(para. 3) to select the project agribusiness companies (PACs) and cooperatives; and for value \nchain analysis (para. 4) to design project investment to strengthen the PACs and cooperatives \nchains, and their supply chains; and promote mutually beneficial cooperation between the PACs \nand farmers.2 This will be the first ADB project for the PRC to adopt value chain analysis to \ndesign a project and the first sovereign project to adopt the IB approach in the PRC. \n3.  Selecting project agribusiness companies with the inclusive business criteria.3 \nPrior to the PPTA, the project will help the Shanxi Poverty Alleviation and Development Office \n(SPADO) (i) define the IB criteria, which is a composite rating tool to assess potential PACs \nregarding their financial viability, social impact, and innovative features; and (ii) apply the IB \ncriteria to select and engage the PACs that are financially viable and has the potential to make \nsocial impact through job creation, particularly for the poor and low-income population.4 The \nsocial impact assessment tool will include women empowerment criteria; and as part of the \nPPTA, the IB arrangements (i.e., cooperation mechanisms between the IB-qualifying PACs and \ntheir farmer  suppliers  such  as  contract farming,  share-holding,  or  other  modes  of  benefit-\nsharing) will be examined and incorporated in relevant subproject investment plans. During \nproject implementation, the performance of the IB-qualifying PACs will be evaluated; and the \nresults will be used to enhance their poverty and social impact. \n4.  Designing the project based on value chain analysis. After the selection of the PACs \nand cooperatives, the project will (i) analyze the value chain of each PAC to prepare the \nsubproject investment plan, which will map out the investment for project output 1; and possible \ncooperation arrangements with relevant private sector services and government programs for \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance Report for Inclusive Business Support (Cofinanced by the Government of \nSweden and Credit Suisse AG). Manila (TA 8550-REG). The technical assistance (TA), administered by the Social \nDevelopment  Thematic  Group  (SDTC-SOC)  under  the  Thematic  Advisory  Service  Cluster  (SDTC)  ADB\u2019s \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC) will provide support for the inclusive business \n(IB) approach. \n2  ADB. 2015. Technical Assistance Report for Building Sustainable Food and Nutrition Security in Asia and the \nPacific (Phase 1). Manila (TA 9057-REG). The TA, administered by the Agriculture, Rural Development, and Food \nSecurity Unit (SDCC-AR) of SDCC, will provide support for value chain analysis. \n3  ADB defines inclusive business (IB) as commercially viable companies whose core business models create a \nscaled-up, systemic, and innovative solution to the relevant problems of the poor and low-income population. \nPromoting the IB approach is important to the PRC government which currently chairs the G20 discussions where \nthe IB is one of the topics. In addition, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is also considering the IB \npromotion as a new area of focus. ADB is currently doing a market-scoping study on the IB approach in the PRC. \n4  Due to the preliminary appraisal, not all the PACs will qualify the IB selection criteria. ", "2  Appendix 3 \nproject output 2; (ii) prepare a value chain analysis manual; and (iii) train the SPADO, its lower \nadministrative bureaus, and the project agricultural value chain participants on value chain \nanalysis.5 The value chain analysis will examine if the PACs and cooperatives have stable \ncooperation with farmers, and if the cooperation is beneficial for the farmers; and propose forms \nof cooperation that will ensure benefits for those farmers, as needed. The value chain analysis \nwill also assess financial viability of the PACs and cooperatives, and their value chains; identify \ngovernment policies or programs that hinder the development of the agriculture-based industry \nin the province; and explore climate change adaptation and mitigation opportunities.  \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n5.  The PPTA will (i) assess the project\u2019s technical, economic, and financial feasibility; (ii) \nassess  safeguards  requirements;  (iii)  conduct  social  survey  and  consultations  for  poverty, \nsocial, and gender analyses; (iv) prepare project documents according to ADB\u2019s requirements; \n(v) assist the SPG in revising domestic feasibility studies and improving safeguard documents in \nline with ADB\u2019s and the government\u2019s requirements; and (vi) conduct training and capacity \ndevelopment.

It comprises (i) identifying participants to the value chain (e.g., primary producers, processors, traders, \nand service providers), and determining the chain governance or leadership that will facilitate the chain formation \nand strengthening; (ii) identifying value-adding activities in the chain, and assigning costs and added value to each \nof those activities; and (iii) identifying opportunities for investment, capacity building, and other measures by \nbridging the chain with public and private services, and government programs that are external, yet critical, to the \nchain.
