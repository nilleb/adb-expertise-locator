The  country  strategies  and  programs  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \nBangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal emphasize the importance of sustainable economic \ngrowth for poverty reduction and recognize the role of the private sector as a catalyst in \neconomic development. Support for private sector development is an integral part of ADB\u2019s \noperational strategies for these countries, with emphasis on developing the policy, institutional, \nand regulatory frameworks to create an enabling environment for private sector participation in \neconomic development. In industry, trade, and finance, ADB\u2019s assistance programs give priority \nto projects that enhance economic opportunities with the involvement of the private sector and \nhelp reduce poverty. In such operations, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have a \nsignificant role to play. \n \n2.  In  ADB\u2019s  assistance  program  for  Bangladesh  for  2003\u20132005,  private  sector-led \noperations in industry and trade are anchored on SME development and export diversification \nand expansion. The Government of India is keen to develop the backward and isolated states of \nNortheast  India1  and  improve  their  connectivity  to  the  rest  of  the  country.  In  Nepal,  the \nGovernment seeks greater private sector involvement in agroprocessing and trade areas to \naccelerate agricultural diversification and growth and develop private agribusiness and SMEs in \nthe rural areas. The Government\u2019s strategy for private sector development includes improving \nrural  infrastructure  to  stimulate  rural  small-scale  private  initiatives  and  human  resource \ndevelopment to address the widespread shortage of business, commercial, and technical skills. \nADB has provided a rural microfinance loan for onlending to rural borrowers (mainly women), \ntraining women in occupational skills, and capacity building of microfinance institutions. In \nBhutan, ADB has provided a financial intermediation facility to improve access to credit by the \nprivate sector and create a supportive policy environment and enabling legal framework for \nprivate sector business. Nepal and Bhutan, both landlocked, seek assistance and cooperation \nto expand the road network to link them to neighboring countries and promote multimodal \ntransport  and  communication,  cross-border  trade,  and  regional  electricity  exchange.  The \ngovernments of all four countries support subregional cooperation under the ADB-assisted \nSouth  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC),  which  is  developing  an  action \nprogram of priority subregional projects in energy; transport; tourism; environment protection; \nand trade, investment, and private sector cooperation. \n \n3.  Since mid-2001, ADB has been discussing with the International Finance Corporation \n(IFC) as well as some of the funding agencies such as the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for \nInternational Development (DFID) ADB\u2019s participation in the Southasia Enterprise Development \nFacility (SEDF) (Appendix 1), which seeks to address constraints in SME development in the \nBangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Northeast India (BBNNI) subregion. SEDF, with headquarters \nin  Dhaka,  Bangladesh,  also  promotes  cross-border  trade,  thus  complementing  SASEC\u2019s \ninitiative in trade and investment. Initially, IFC requested ADB to contribute to the trust fund set \nup to finance SEDF activities. After further discussions, ADB proposed to participate by means \nof a regional technical assistance (RETA) in a way similar to ADB\u2019s involvement in the South \nPacific Project Development Facility and the Mekong Project Development Facility. A fact-\nfinding mission visited Dhaka in September 2002, and reached an understanding with the IFC \non the RETA\u2019s objectives, scope, cost, and implementation arrangements.2 \n                                                 \n1  Northeast India comprises Assam, Arunachal Pradesh,  Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim, and \nTripura. \n2  The RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in October 2002. ", "2  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  SMEs in South Asia are not contributing to sustainable growth and job creation, which \nare essential to offset deep, persistent poverty. BBNNI has few SMEs, and their contribution to \nthe economy is very limited.  Bhutan has roughly 200 registered companies, almost all very \nsmall;  many  medium-sized  companies  are  in  tourism,  construction,  forestry  products,  and \nagribusiness. Nepal  has approximately 4,000 registered enterprises that employ 10 or more \nworkers,  mostly  at  the  small  end;  firms  catering  to  tourists  abound. Northeast India has \napproximately 180 medium-sized and large enterprises with assets larger than $450,000, and \n47,000 small enterprises with assets smaller than $450,000 (mostly on the smaller end). The \nnumber of larger registered companies in Bangladesh is also very small given its population of \nover 130 million people. A government survey shows that the country has 27,000 enterprises \nwith assets larger than $600,000, and 150,000 enterprises with assets of less than $600,000. \nSMEs in Bangladesh\u2014representing roughly 82% of the total industrial labor force and 23% of \nthe total labor force\u2014contribute half of the country\u2019s industrial output. However, SME activities \nin Bangladesh are narrowly focused on a small number of industries (garments and food \nprocessing), most of which are low value-added activities with simple technology using low-cost \nlabor. \n \n5.  Historical and geographical factors have constrained SME growth in many parts of the \nregion. Trade and communication links have been impeded by the formidable mountainous \nterrain in Bhutan, Nepal, and Northeast India. Tension at border areas, and ethnic heterogeneity \ncontribute to the perception of political instability and high business risk. In BBNNI, historical \ngovernance  structures  have  allowed  the  few  well  connected  to  garner  most  economic \nresources, and restricted access for most people. Transfer of ownership and control of most \nproductive, nonfarm resources from government to the private sector has been slow. SME \ndevelopment is constrained by fragmented policy and regulatory frameworks; inefficient physical \ninfrastructure;  underdeveloped  core  market  support  institutions;  restricted  access  to  credit \nservices from banks; and immature business development services (information, training, and \nconsulting services).  Most SMEs are family owned and have failed to develop professional \nmiddle management and a system of delegation required for business expansion. Transaction \ncosts are high throughout the economy and place SMEs at a competitive disadvantage. The \nlack of effective governance and poor application of the rule of law increase business risks. In \nthe  formal  sector,  the  administrative  burden  imposed  by  regulations  and  the  bureaucracy \nhinders expansion, particularly of small enterprises. Most SME interventions are government-\nled,  channeled  through  government  structures  and  parastatals,  and  have  not  been  very \neffective.  \n \n6.  While each of the countries in BBNNI has unique problems in SME development, the \nconstraints are similar and fall into three categories: lack of access to credit and financial \nservices, lack of access to quality business development services, and high cost of doing \nbusiness and weaknesses in the enabling environment. SEDF will focus its assistance to \novercome them. In light of the overall issues, constraints, opportunities, and population sizes, \nSEDF will primarily focus on Bangladesh, with smaller focused outreach programs in Bhutan, \nNepal, and Northeast India. \n \n7.  SEDF was established in April 2002 and is managed on behalf of the contributing \ndonors by the Small and Medium Enterprises Department of the World Bank Group, a joint \ndepartment of IFC and the World Bank. The 5-year budget for the facility is $29.7 million \nand  an  additional  $2.3  million  for  the  SME  Knowledge  Development  Center.  IFC\u2019s \ncontribution is $5 million over 5 years. DFID has made a firm commitment to contribute $5 ", "  3 \nmillion over 5 years. The Government of the Netherlands committed to contribute the \nequivalent  of  \u20ac  (\u0192)1 million (about $1.2 million) for 2003, and will approve subsequent \ncontributions  annually.  Discussions  on  funding  contributions  are  underway  with  the \nEuropean  Commission  ($10  million),  Government  of  Norway  (about  $5  million),  and \nCanadian  International Development Agency (about $3 million). Depending on how the \nprogram develops, small suboffices may subsequently be opened in Bhutan, Nepal, and \nNortheast India. During the first 2 years, 50\u201380% of the SEDF facility budget (Appendix 1) \nwill be for expenditures in Bangladesh. The share of expenditures for SME programs in \nBhutan,  Nepal,  and  Northeast  India,  and  for  intraregional  trade  promotion  is  likely  to \nsignificantly increase beginning in the second year. \n \n8.  In Bangladesh, SEDF will target the \u201cunderserved middle,\u201d comprising enterprises that \nare  larger  than  microenterprises.  Unlike  microenterprises,  these  SMEs  do  not  receive \nassistance through nongovernment organizations. Many SMEs are owned by women. SMEs \ngenerate new jobs  for low-income groups and benefit microenterprises by purchasing SME \ngoods and services and by supplying SMEs with skills and technology. Some SMEs export their \nproducts or provide parts and services to larger firms selling to foreign markets. To operate \neffectively, SMEs need a supportive and fairly administered regulatory framework, and well-\nfunctioning markets for finance and business services.  \n \n9.  The purpose of the SEDF program is to address constraints on SMEs by increasing \ntheir access to finance and business development and support services, and improving the \nregulatory environment. SEDF will help SMEs with a mix of programs (see the budget for \nprogram details), working in conjunction with local financial institutions, training institutions, \nconsultants,  and  government  agencies.  SEDF  will  help  increase  the  operational \ncompetence  of  SMEs,  improve  their  management,  and  raise  their  productivity,  thus \nenhancing the number, growth rate, and competitiveness of SMEs, and thereby contributing \nto  broad-based  and  sustainable  growth  resulting  in  poverty  reduction.  The  three \ncomponents of the SEDF program are in Appendix 1. \n \n10.  SEDF staff consist of 15 persons, including the general manager, who is deputed by the \nWorld  Bank/IFC  SME  Department.  The  total  staff  strength  in  Dhaka  is  budgeted  at  35, \ncomprising 4 expatriate, 3 regional, and about 28 local staff (Appendix 1). The program \nmanager, financial market specialist, and enterprise support specialist will each manage \none of the three components. The budget estimates provide for support from the  World \nBank/IFC  SME  Department  head  office,  especially  to  develop  and  adapt  successful \nbusiness support and training products.  \n \n11.  Governance arrangements for SEDF include the Donor Oversight Committee (DOC) and \nan advisory panel. The DOC will comprise representatives of all donors that have financed \nSEDF. Meetings will be held at least twice a year in Dhaka, at times agreed on by DOC \nmembers, and preferably to coincide with key implementation milestones. Meetings will consider \nthe annual work plan and budget, and a midyear review of progress. The DOC will  review \nSEDF\u2019s forward work plans; strategies; targets and budgets; and performance relative to \nagreed objectives, plans, and budgets. The DOC will also (i) approve new appointments \nand changes in key personnel; (ii) advise the World Bank/IFC SME Department and SEDF \nmanagement  on  implementation;  (iii)  approve  the  terms  of  reference  for  a  midterm \nevaluation of SEDF, and review the evaluation study; and (iv) facilitate coordination of \nrelated SME programs. DOC decisions will be by consensus. The advisory panel will advise ", "4  \nSEDF management on strategies, priorities, and work plans from a client perspective. Panel \nmembership, subject to review by the DOC, will be drawn from local business associations, \ninternational  research  institutes,  financial  institutions,  nongovernment  organizations, \naccounting and auditing bodies, and business schools.  \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s agenda to facilitate SME growth and development in BBNNI is to (i) improve the \nbusiness environment for SMEs; (ii) improve SMEs\u2019 access to financing through assistance to \nfinancial institutions to raise the efficiency of SMEs and expand their products/ services; (iii) \nincrease the competence of SMEs through sustainable market-driven capacity building, training, \nand business services; (iv) increase SME exports; and (v) actively support the development of \nwomen entrepreneurs. This agenda is consistent with the SEDF strategy paper presented at the \nfirst  DOC  meeting  in  October  2002,  attended  by  ADB,  and  is  reflected  in  the  technical \nassistance (TA) project framework (Appendix 2). \n \n13.  In Bangladesh, ADB has a project preparatory technical assistance to prepare a sector \ndevelopment program for SME development and export expansion (SMEDEEP) to foster the \ngrowth and competitiveness of SMEs. The TA will help formulate a program, with focus on \nSMEs, for export expansion, including trade finance and export credit insurance schemes and \nidentification of a reform agenda to promote and develop a dynamic SME sector. SEDF will \ncomplement SMEDEEP in increasing SME access to funds and facilities of financial institutions \naccredited by SMEDEEP; helping providers of business development and support services that \nbenefit  SMEs  (particularly  those  SMEs  availing  of  financing  from  SMEDEEP);  supporting \nindependent  and  sustainable  business  chambers  that  represent  SMEs  and  promote  their \ngrowth, particularly in subsectors with comparative advantage; and easing the regulatory burden \non the creation and operation of SMEs. The main linkages between SEDF and SMEDEEP will \nbe the joint formulation of project development approaches, adoption of a user-friendly rating \nsystem for potential SME borrowers, preparation and sharing of information needed for funding \napplication  for  SME  projects  with  SMEDEEP-accredited  financial  institutions,  establishing \neligibility for subprojects to be financed, and building a pipeline of subprojects for financial \ninstitutions participating under SMEDEEP.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n14.  To pursue ADB\u2019s  overarching  goal  of  reducing  poverty  in  the  developing  member \ncountries  in  South  Asia,  the  RETA  aims  to  enhance  the  growth  of  commercially  viable, \nsustainable, and competitive SMEs in the private sector in BBNNI. Using the network of \nfinancial institutions and business service providers and the organizational and governance \nstructure of SEDF, the RETA will help improve access of SMEs to finance and financial \nservices, provide better business development and support services for SMEs, and create an \nenabling environment conducive to the growth and development of SMEs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The RETA will help meet the cost of consultants recruited by SEDF for its program to (i) \nundertake project-related activities to evaluate and prepare SME projects for financing, (ii) \nstrengthen local providers of business development and support services targeted at developing \nprojects and programs for SMEs in selected sectors, and (iii) carry out studies and provide \nadvice  on  issues  and  reform  areas  of  direct  concern  to  SMEs  to  improve  the  enabling ", "  5 \nenvironment. Consultants\u2019 work will be carried out in or related to projects in BBNNI. RETA-\nfunded projects will have a demonstrative positive impact in promoting private sector SME \ndevelopment. The RETA will support reform measures and improvements in the regulatory \nprocesses to remove impediments to SME growth and development.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n16.  The RETA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent (Appendix 3) and will finance part of the \nconsulting expenditures of SEDF over 2 years ending 31 December 2004 (totaling about $3.5 \nmillion [Appendix 1]). Of the RETA amount, $720,000 will be utilized to pay consultants\u2019 fees, \nairfares, daily subsistence payments, travel-related miscellaneous fees, and report preparation \ncosts of consulting assignments. About $30,000 will be budgeted to help defray the cost of \nproject-related workshops. The RETA will be financed by ADB on grant basis from the ADB-\nfunded TA program.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  SEDF will be the Executing Agency for the RETA. SEDF will undertake all matters \nrelated to the objective, scope, and approach of each consulting assignment; preparation of the \nterms  of  reference  and  work  schedule;  selection  and  recruitment  of  the  consultants;  and \nadministration of the assignment. ADB will be a member the DOC and have a proactive role in \nsetting the strategic directions of SEDF and formulating its overall program of activities. This will \nenable  close  collaboration  between  the  SEDF  program  and  ADB\u2019s  programs,  particularly \nSMEDEEP, as well as those of other donors. SEDF will submit to ADB the terms of reference of \nprojects to be funded by the RETA and regular status reports on these projects. SEDF offices in \nthe four countries will meet regularly with ADB resident missions to discuss TA-funded projects \nto ensure coordination at the operational level, allowing input for dialogue on reforms with the \nconcerned governments.  \n \n18.  The RETA will be implemented over 2 years. Scheduled to commence in January 2003, \nit will fund about 12 consulting assignments for approximately 40 person-months of international \nand local consulting firms or individual consultants. The RETA will also partly finance workshops \nwhere the outputs and reports of some consulting assignments will be presented and discussed. \nSEDF  follows  IFC  consultant  selection  procedures.  Accordingly,  IFC  consultant  selection \nprocedures consistent with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants will be used in selecting \nconsultants financed under the  RETA. IFC\u2019s guidelines for payment of consultant fees and \nallowances will apply.  SEDF will seek reimbursement from ADB for contracted consulting \nservices on the basis of quarterly claims for eligible expenditures. A formal agreement will be \nmade between ADB and IFC on procedures to ensure that the RETA funds are applied only to \nmeet costs relating to consultants recruited from ADB member countries. Viable and suitable \nprojects developed using RETA funds will be referred to ADB for financing under its credit or \nguarantee facility and/or its country or regional equity funds. The eligibility criteria and operating \nprocedures for use of RETA funds are in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nSmall- and Medium-Sized Enterprise Growth and Development in the South Asia Region, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nSOUTHASIA ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT FACILITY  \n \nA.  Constraints and Assistance Programs \n1.  Bangladesh \n \n1.  A survey of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) commissioned by the World \nBank in 2000 cited the main constraints on their development: (i) lack of access to institutional \ncredit and high interest rates for loans; (ii) poor infrastructure, including power, gas, and port \nfacilities; (iii) government policies that allow too many imports, frequently devalue the currency, \nand keep tariffs high on intermediate inputs; (iv) government bureaucracy, corruption, and red \ntape; and (v) underdeveloped business management skills. The study pointed more concerns: \n(i) the urgent need to sort out Bangladeshi firms\u2019 comparative advantage in the garment industry \nas well as to diversify exports in light of the coming phase-out of critical Multifibre Agreement \nquotas, (ii) high tariff and nontariff trade barriers that hamper regional export growth, (iii) the \ndetrimental effects on business of low basic and technical education levels in Bangladesh; and \n(iv) the need for  Government to simplify its business regulations and withdraw as business \nservice provider and become creator and guardian of the business environment.  \n \n2.  Several efforts are ongoing, supported by donors, to address these constraints. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) has a project preparatory technical assistance (TA) to prepare \na sector development program for SME development and export expansion (SMEDEEP) to \nfoster the growth and competitiveness of SMEs. SMEDEEP will benefit from the results of an \nannual  survey  by  Southasia  Enterprise  Development  Facility  (SEDF)  of  some  200  SMEs \nincluded in the sample of 1,200 private sector companies in Bangladesh covered by the World \nBank\u2019s ongoing Investment Climate Assessment Study (scheduled to be finished in May 2003) \non policy distortions; regulatory constraints (licensing, customs, tax, labor); and costs of doing \nbusiness. SMEDEEP will also get baseline data on business development services from the \nnational survey funded by the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development \n(DFID) of the characteristics (employment, assets, etc.) of private enterprises, their problems \nwith, use of, and attitudes to business development services. This survey\u2014Growth and Equity \nthrough Microenterprise Investments and Institutions (GEMINI)\u2014is part of DFID\u2019s Developing \nBusiness Services Markets (DBSM), designed to facilitate the development of effective markets \nfor business development services, targeting SMEs. DBSM has complementarities with SEDF \n(in which DFID is a main contributor) and SMEDEEP. \n \n2.  Bhutan  \n \n3.  The top constraints cited by Bhutanese entrepreneurs in the capital included (i) unduly \nlimited access to credit funds due to banks\u2019 unreasonably high requirements for collateral (1.5 \ntimes the loan amount) along with unfairly low asset valuations, high interest rates on loans \n(13%\u201314% for term loans, 15% for working capital, 16% for overdrafts), short maturity of term \nloans at a maximum of 5 years; lack of capacity in market analysis within local banks; and lack \nof access to credit for newly established businesses; (ii) lack of access to land for business use \ndue to government zoning and to a shortage of government funds to develop additional land; (iii) \nsevere shortages of technically skilled Bhutanese labor, in part due to ad hoc, nonstandardized \ntechnical training and to restrictions on importing foreign skilled labor along with the high cost of \nBhutanese labor relative to Indian labor; (iv) lack of business experience and the need for \ngreater  professionalism  of  business  practices;  and  (v)  lack  of  knowledge  of  how  to  use \ncomputers to increase business efficiencies.  \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \n4.  Factors that limit the entry and growth of SMEs include (i) a dearth of bankable SME \nprojects, due mainly to an inability to put together business plans and a lack of equity capital; (ii) \nthe difficulties that local SMEs face in competing with their Indian neighbors, particularly as \nregards consumer goods for local markets; (iii) lack of an agency to implement new accounting \nstandards  as  Bhutan  has  not  more  than  five  chartered  accountants;  (iv)  severely \nunderdeveloped tourism infrastructure and an urgent need to expand training services for \ntourism professionals; and (v) severe shortages of technical workers needed by the private \nsector. \n \n5.  Ongoing donor-supported programs to promote SMEs include (i) the  United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP)-funded Entrepreneurship Development Center at the Ministry \nof Trade and Industry, which offers basic skills training and computer courses; (ii) training \nprovided by the Government of the Netherlands to private firms to be contractors in road works, \npower transmission lines, and minihydro; and (iii) Danish International Development Assistance \n(DANIDA) support to develop private sector media and Internet-based information kiosks in the \nprovinces. Under a financial sector intermediation facility,  ADB provided credit to over 250 \nsubborrowers  through  Bhutan  Development  Financing  Corporation,  improved  the  industrial \nlicensing system, and issued import licensing and banking prudential regulations. \n \n3.  Nepal \n \n6.  The most binding constraints faced by private sector firms in Nepal are (i) poor business \nenvironment, characterized by distorted policies and regulations, and poor implementation, \neconomic depression, and inadequate infrastructure; (ii) limited access to capital; (iii) weak links \nto markets outside the small domestic market; and (iv) a high level of political instability. \nInformation technology (IT) development needs a regulatory framework, training standards in \ncomputer training, and rationalized tariff regime for computer hardware and software.  \n \n7.  SME development initiatives include the Agro-business Center and SME program under \nthe Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industries, the World Bank-supported \nNepal  Trade  Diagnostic  Study,  and  the  small-enterprise  program  operated  by  Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ). Under the ADB rural microfinance project, \nrural women were trained in group formation, leadership, and occupational skills. ADB has a \ntechnical assistance loan to improve corporate and financial governance to address the problem \nof high transaction cost of business and poor financial intermediation. \n \nNortheast India \n \n8.  The private sector in the northeastern states of India faces similar constraints and \nissues, including inefficient physical infrastructure, weak market support institutions, restricted \naccess to credit, and undeveloped business development and support services, which all \ncontribute to the high cost of doing business. ADB does not have a program specifically for \nSMEs in Northeast India. \n \nB.  Southasia Enterprise Development Facility Program Components \n9.  SEDF prepared a strategic plan covering Bangladesh and presented it to the Donor \nOversight Committee in October 2002. SEDF plans to finalize its strategy for Bhutan and \nNortheast India in the first quarter of 2003, but has delayed scoping the assistance program \nfor Nepal because of the volatile political situation and threat from the rebels. \n ", "8  Appendix 1 \n10.  The largest component (50%) of the SEDF program will be improving access to \nfinancial services. The facility will work with private banks and nonbank financial institutions \nto improve their overall efficiency as well as make them more efficient and effective in \nproviding financial services to SMEs, and increase their capacity to expand deal flows. In \nBangladesh, SEDF will enter into partnership agreements with each of 10 or more  local \nfinancial institutions meeting its eligibility requirements to implement a plan of action agreed \nupon after a diagnostic exercise.1 The likely partner banks are Arab Bangladesh Bank, BRAC \nBank, Dhaka Bank, Dutch-Bangla Bank, Islamic Bank, NCC Bank, Prime Bank, and Southeast \nBank. SEDF is also likely to have as partners the two leading leasing companies\u2014Industrial \nDevelopment Leasing Company, where IFC has an equity investment; and United Leasing \nCompany, where ADB has a 20% stake. In Bhutan, SEDF will work with the Bank of Bhutan and \nBhutan National Bank (which received support from ADB as a participating financial institution \nunder  ADB\u2019s  financial  intermediation  facility)  to  develop  their  capacity  and  introduce  new \nproducts. SEDF will focus on tourism, construction, and agribusiness and will help strengthen \nbusiness associations. In Nepal, possible candidate partner banks are the Nepal Arab Bank and \nNepal Bangla Bank. In Northeast India, SEDF has signed a memorandum of understanding with \nthe Small Industries Development Bank of India to train its officers and jointly work to identify \nand develop subsectors to be identified when the SEDF strategy is prepared in the first quarter \nof 2003. In agribusiness, discussions have been held with the Tea Board to help smallholder tea \ngrowers. SEDF is planning to sign a memorandum of understanding with the North East \nDevelopment Financing Institution.  \n \n11.  SEDF will provide consulting assistance and training related to SME lending on a cost-\nsharing basis (normally 50:50), and based upon financial, economic, social, and environmental \nscreening of potential lending projects. SEDF will assess the effective demand for new SME \nfinancing  products,  determine  their  feasibility,  and  collaborate  with  domestic  financial \nagencies, including the central bank, financial service providers, and donors to develop and \nimplement the products as  commercial investment opportunities. SEDF will also provide \nbusiness  diagnostics  and  technical  and  financial  services  directly  to  selected  firms  in \ntargeted  subsectors.  To  make  this  activity  sustainable,  SEDF  will  aim  to  recover  an \nincreasing level of its  costs, and involve local consultants as partners to develop their \ncapacity. In Bhutan, SEDF plans to introduce management training products aimed at smaller \ncompanies than those to be offered in Bangladesh. A study will be conducted to ascertain \nmarket segment and type of training.  \n \n12.  To improve business development and support services (33% of the budget), SEDF will \nhelp selected training institutions, including business schools, with a track record in working with \nSMEs, to develop and deliver high-quality, commercially viable management training courses. \nSEDF will also establish a number of internationally recognized local International Organization \nfor Standardization (ISO) certification organizations. SEDF will harness the multimedia learning \ntools to train entrepreneurs and service providers and use web-based mentorship. SEDF will \nsupport Internet and  IT initiatives, including working with selected Internet service providers in \ndeveloping new products and services that are useful to SMEs, especially in rural areas, and \noffering commercial services such as electronic access to government regulations and \nforms and information on opportunities for business-to-business Internet trade.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The first criterion is the financial institution\u2019s willingness to collaborate on a 50-50 cost-sharing basis in SEDF \nprograms to achieve certain agreed-on target objectives with respect to increasing the SME portfolio on an annual \nbasis. The other important criteria are (i) belonging to the private sector (with majority private ownership); (ii) sound \nfinancial structure in terms of capital adequacy, level of nonperforming assets, etc.; (iii) wide coverage of branch \nnetwork; and (iv) willingness to undergo diagnostic analysis. ", "  Appendix 1  9 \n13.  Under the enabling environment component (17% of budget), SEDF seeks to increase \nthe voice of the private sector to improve the business environment.  SEDF will work with \nselected business membership organizations (BMOs) representing private sector SMEs that \nhave the commitment and potential to research and advocate improvements in the enabling \nenvironment. SEDF will undertake targeted business surveys (such as the ongoing Investment \nClimate Assessment Study) and focused studies, and facilitate dialogue with key government \nofficials and business leaders on reforms emerging from consultations with SMEs, BMOs, and \ndonors. SEDF will help companies implement good corporate governance practices. The \nfacility will work mainly through business and trade associations, but also directly with firms \nor groups of firms to create awareness about the benefits of adhering to good corporate, as \nwell as socially and environmentally responsible, business practices. SEDF will work with \nBMOs to organize regional seminars to identify and discuss issues of direct concern to \nSMEs such as cross-border trade and sourcing of raw materials, trade, and investment \nopportunities and areas of regional and subregional cooperation. SEDF will also pilot the \ndevelopment of supply chain linkages between SMEs and large corporations. A special \nproject of SEDF will be the establishment and management of an SME Knowledge Center \nusing IT and Internet-based tools and resources to provide in \u201cone stop shop\u201d information \nand support for SMEs, business training and support service providers, and donors and \nothers interested in SME development.  \n \n14.  In interregional trade, SEDF is helping the Chittagong Chamber of Commerce and \nIndustry and Tripura State identify potential opportunities for and constraints on trade. A \ndirect assistance project is helping a Bangladeshi firm buy pineapples from Tripura for \nprocessing in Chittagong and export to Europe. This will have demonstration value of \nopportunities that can be identified and developed. \n \nC.   Terms of Reference \n \n15.  SEDF could undertake projects/studies that are of particular interest to ADB, to address \npolicy issues concerning SMEs and export development or to undertake activities such as \nfinancial and operational audit preparatory to reengineering an enterprise to respond to new \nchallenges and remain viable, for which financing will be needed from credit line/guarantee \nfacility  of  the  ADB  sector  development  program.  Terms  of  reference  prepared  for  such \nprojects/studies will be reviewed by ADB. \n \n16.  Possible uses of ADB regional technical assistance funds include training to be provided \nto local banks and nonbank financial institutions on credit assessment, technical assistance to \nbanks on market segmentation and credit scoring, development of a project proposal for an \nSME referred to by a partner financial institution, development of IT projects such as software \ndevelopment, productivity improvement of the garment sector, among others. Details of all \nassignments involving the regional technical assistance will be provided to ADB along with the \nterms of reference and deliverables. Below are sample terms of reference. \n \n1.  Shop Floor Productivity Improvement Diagnostics \n17.  SEDF  will  select  eight  companies  with  the  help  of  the  Bangladesh  Garment \nManufacturers and Exporters Association to conduct a shop floor productivity improvement \ndiagnostics program. The consulting firm to be recruited will serve as SEDF\u2019s \u201cknowledge \npartner\u201d to do the necessary analysis, work material, tool development, and workshop content, \nwhile SEDF will facilitate, and help the consultant in, data collection. ", "10  Appendix 1 \n18.  The terms of reference of the consultant include the following tasks: \n \n(i)  Comprehensively audit the manufacturing processes of the eight companies, \nanalyzing their levels of operations. \n(ii)  Establish performance levels at the factory against appropriate \u201cbest practice\u201d \nbenchmarks. \n(iii)  Quantify  improvement  potential  in  productivity,  quality,  and  technology  and \nsystems (preproduction and production); identify gaps; and discuss issues with \nmanagement of each unit in the company. \n(iv)  Provide short- and long-term recommendations to improve productivity, quality, \nand technology and systems (preproduction and production). \n(v)  Submit a final report detailing the findings and the recommendations for a viable \nperformance development program (reengineering, etc.) for discussion with each \nparticipating company. \n(vi)  Submit a final report to SEDF giving an overall analysis of all participating \ncompanies,  benchmarking  their  performance  against  \u201cbest  practices\u201d  in  the \nregion. \n \n19.  The diagnostics for each facility will be delivered in three steps: \n \nStep 1. A joint briefing with the team members (2\u20133 people) from each participating \ncompany will be held. The consulting team will make a presentation to elaborate on the \nprocess of the \u201cgap analysis.\u201d A questionnaire to collect the relevant data will be given to \neach team. The information required by the consultant should be collected in preparation \nfor the on-site work. \n \nStep 2. The consulting team will spend 3 days at each factory on site to analyze the \noperations. This will involve detailed discussion with people on the shop floor and also \nthe  supervisors  and  line  managers  in  each  section.  On  the  third  afternoon,  a \npresentation  detailing  all  gaps  and  perspective  improvement  opportunities  will  be \nhighlighted to the concerned facility management via a report. \n \nStep 3. A final report detailing the findings and the recommendations made by the \nconsultant will be submitted to each participating company. The outputs of the \u201cgap \nanalysis\u201d/assessment will lead to the development of a viable performance development \nprogram. A summary report of the overall analysis of all participating companies will be \nsubmitted after the entire exercise to SEDF.  \n \n20.  The entire exercise will take 5 weeks. The final reports to be submitted to SEDF should \nbe delivered within 30 days from the end of the exercise.  \n \nD.

Regional  technical  assistance  (RETA)  funds  may  be  used  to  meet  the  costs  of \nconsultants recruited by the Southasia Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF) for specific \nproject assignments as detailed here. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and International \nFinance Corporation (IFC) will enter into an agreement on mutually acceptable terms and \nconditions, incorporating the following eligibility criteria and operating procedures: \n \n(i)  Consultants  will  work  on  specific  assignments  undertaken  by  SEDF  in \naccordance  with  its  objective  of  promoting  viable  private  sector  small-  and \nmedium-sized enterprise (SME) projects, thereby contributing to self-sustaining \neconomic growth in the South Asia subregion, comprising Bangladesh, Bhutan, \nNepal, and Northeast India (BBNNI). \n \n(ii)  Viable and suitable projects developed using technical assistance (TA) funds will \nbe referred to ADB for potential financing under its credit or guarantee facility \nand/or its country or regional equity funds. \n \n(iii)  Each consultant will be selected and engaged in accordance with IFC consultant \nrecruitment procedures that are consistent with ADB Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. In particular, SEDF will ensure that qualified candidates from all \nADB member countries are eligible for consideration for any assignment to be \nfinanced by the RETA. \n \n(iv)  Eligible expenses under the RETA are fees, airfares, and subsistence payments \nto consultants and for project-related workshops determined in accordance with \nIFC standard procedures and guidelines. \n \n(v)  Work undertaken by the consultants will be carried out in, or related to, projects \nin BBNNI. \n \n(vi)  Consultants may be individuals or firms. Individual consultants, whether recruited \ndirectly  or  through  a  firm,  will  be  nationals  of  ADB  member  countries.  A \nconsulting firm, whether directly engaged, or providing an individual consultant, \nwill be from an ADB member country. \n \n(vii)  Except  as  ADB  may  otherwise  agree,  RETA  funds  will  not  be  applied  to \nassignments for privatization of public sector enterprises, or for projects involving \nenterprises that have a majority government ownership. \n \n(viii)  Except as ADB may otherwise agree, RETA funds will not be applied  to any \nsingle consulting assignment with a total cost exceeding $200,000 equivalent. \n \n(ix)  SEDF will submit quarterly claims to ADB for reimbursement of eligible expenses \nunder the RETA.
