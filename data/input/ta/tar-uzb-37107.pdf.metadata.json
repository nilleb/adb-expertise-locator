During the country programming mission of the  Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nUzbekistan in 2002, the Government requested ADB assistance for promoting sustainable \ndevelopment for the energy sector.1 The ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Uzbekistan from 8 to \n12 March 2003. An understanding was reached with the Government on the goals, purpose, \nscope, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference of the technical assistance (TA). The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Uzbekistan has substantial energy resources. The total reserve of hydrocarbon fuel in \nUzbekistan is estimated at over 7 billion tons of oil equivalent, natural gas at 1.88 trillion cubic \nmeters, oil at 600 million barrels, and coal at approximately 4 billion tons. Natural gas is the \npredominant energy source in Uzbekistan. It produces about 62 billion cubic meters of natural \ngas per year, most of which is consumed domestically for power generation and production of \npetrochemicals.  \n \n3.  Uzbekistan  produces  approximately  48,000  gigawatt  hours  of  electricity  annually. \nElectricity is derived primarily from conventional thermal power generation, with 77% of plants \npowered by natural gas, 7% by fuel oil, and 3.5% by coal. The remaining 12.5% of the electricity \ncomes from hydropower. There are 11 large thermal power plants (9,870 megawatt [MW] of \ninstalled  capacity)  and  31  hydropower  stations  (1,700  MW  of  installed  capacity),  with  a \ncumulative installed capacity of 11,570 MW. Almost all of these plants are very old, the average \nage being more than 30 years, and in need of substantial rehabilitation. According to recent \nestimates, up to $1.15 billion worth of investments will be required for rehabilitating thermal \npower generation plants alone in the next 3\u20135 years. The reliability of plant and equipment is \nvery poor. At the same time the demand is increasing, particularly during peak periods both in \nsummer and winter, and the system is unable to meet the increasing demand. According to \nrecent data, the peak period deficit is about 800\u2013900 MW in winter. \n \n4.  Power generation in Uzbekistan has been decreasing since the country\u2019s independence. \nAlthough the installed capacity for electricity generation has increased from 1992 to 1999 the \nelectricity output dropped by 11%. Since 1996, Uzbekistan has been a net electricity importer. \nProduction of liquid hydrocarbons (crude oil and gas condensate) has also declined, from 8.1 \nmillion tons in 1999 to 7.2 million tons in 2002. Such declines may be permanent because the \nproducing reservoirs are experiencing drops in pressure and increased water influx. Major gas \nfields are going into decline, and new reserves have not been replaced.  \n \n5.  A major part of electricity is consumed by industries (40%), followed by agriculture \n(30%), and residential consumers (16%); the remaining 14% is consumed by transport (6%) and \ncommunal services (8%). The overall system losses have been estimated at 22%. Per capita \nenergy consumption in Uzbekistan is 1.5\u20132 times higher than in other developing countries. In \n2000, Uzbekistan\u2019s energy intensity was about 4 times higher than the energy intensity of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. Current levels of energy consumption could be reduced by up to \n40\u201350% with no major impact on the present level of development.  \n \n6.  According to estimates, with the current system of energy production and consumption, \nthe 2010 demand in primary energy may exceed the projected power production by about 10%. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 24 February 2003. ", "2  \nIn this context the Government signed the European Energy Charter Treaty and Energy Charter \nProtocol on energy efficiency and relevant environmental aspects.2 This protocol requires each \nparty to prepare a strategy for energy conservation. Therefore, in accordance with the Law on \nRational Use of Energy, Uzbekistan\u2019s Cabinet of Ministers adopted an energy-saving program \non  14  February  2002.  The  main  objectives  of  the  program  are  to  (i) prioritize  energy \nconservation issues and develop appropriate policies to address them, (ii) improve the efficiency \nof using energy resources and promote energy conservation, (iii) reduce energy intensities in \nthe industry sector, (iv) prepare the legislation that will promote energy efficiency intensities in \nthe industry sector, and (v) promote the development of a market-oriented energy sector. \n \n7.  In rural areas, where 62% of the country\u2019s population reside, the supply of electricity is \nunstable. This instability primarily impedes the operation of irrigating systems, which increases \nthe risk of crop failure.3 The instability of available electricity and the absence of local generating \ncapacity increases reliance on mobile diesel pumping stations. Currently, there are 15,000 \nportable  diesel-pumping  stations  burning  about  15,000  tons  of  diesel  fuel  annually.  The \nenvironmental costs of such operations are large due to the emission of air pollutants. The lack \nof electricity in rural areas also results in lower levels of higher-value agricultural processing. It \nis estimated that about 30% of the fruit and vegetable crops is wasted from a lack of storage or \nprocessing facilities. This provides a rationale for local decentralized electricity sources, which \nwould also avoid losses from distribution currently estimated to be about 15% of total power \ngeneration. \n \n8.  In off-grid areas, the cost of providing electricity through a grid could be substantial.4 \nFurther, a considerable portion of existing power lines and substation equipment in Uzbekistan \nwill require reconstruction. Outdated machinery creates problems in operating the power grid. \nMuch capital investment is required for system modernization. So, the potential is good for \nrenewable energy to commercially compete with other conventional form of energies. \n \n9.  Uzbekistan  has  good  potential  for  developing  renewable  energy,  particularly \nhydropower. The hydropower potential from natural water flows in Uzbekistan is about 20,000 \nMW, about 30% from small hydropower sources. Only 30% of the small-scale hydropower \npotential is used. If the potential for hydropower stations is optimized, the electricity generated \nwill be sufficient for all pumping stations, and the water transportation systems under the \njurisdiction of the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR). \n \n10.  The use of solar energy could benefit 900 remote villages and 4,500 sheep farms in \nUzbekistan\u2014where energy and water supply by conventional methods is difficult or impossible. \nFurther, the potential for harnessing wind energy, geothermal resources, and biomass can be \nsubstantial in some regions outside the national capital of Tashkent. \n                                                 \n2  Signed on 17 December 1994, the main objective of the treaty is to establish a legal framework to promote long-\n  term cooperation in the energy sector in accordance with the principles of the European Energy Charter. The \n  important aspects of the treaty are investment protection, trade in energy materials and products, transit, and \n  dispute settlement.  \n3  About 30% of total electricity  generation in Uzbekistan is used by agriculture and half of that is consumed by \n  pumping stations.  \n4  Assuming a 40% load factor, the cost of generation (assuming combined cycle gas), transmission, and distribution \n  are $0.10, $0.30, and $0.02 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), respectively. This brings the total cost of grid generation to \n  $0.42/kWh. Transmission costs assume: a capital cost of $35 million supplying 22 megawatt hours (420 kilovolt \n  (kV) alternating current (AC) line with 3 conductors per phase at around $350,000/kilometer (km), 100 km \n  carrying 5 MW and running at 50% load factor, and 245kV AC line single conductor at around $65,000/km), \n  and 5% operations and maintenance cost, 5% depreciation, and 7% weighted average cost of capital. \n \n ", "  3\n11.  The Government recognizes the importance of renewable energy development in rural \nareas, particularly in off-grid locations. The development of small-scale hydropower is a priority \nin the country\u2019s investment policy as embodied in the 1995 State Program of Small Hydropower \nDevelopment. The program  highlights  the  importance  of  regulating  energy  usage,  nature \nconservation,  and  environmental  protection  along  with  the  development  of  small-scale \nhydropower in the country. Its purpose is to effectively use the hydropower potential of rivers, \nimprove technical aspects, and increase power supply in rural areas. Studies show the technical \nfeasibility of constructing 43 small hydropower plants under the existing water reservoirs, and 98 \non irrigation canals and collectors. The twin use of water for power generation and irrigation \naugurs  well  for  sustainable  development.  In  2000,  the  Program  on  Development  and \nReconstruction of Generating Facilities in Energy Sector in Uzbekistan was developed. The \nprogram envisages the expansion of alternative energy usage such as solar and wind power \ninstallation, and installation of stand-alone power supply systems in regions that are remote and \ndifficult access. \n \n12.  The optimization of energy production and consumption in off-grid rural areas requires \nthe use of renewable energy sources. A wider application of renewable energy generation, \nparticularly solar energy and hydropower, will ensure sustainable development for isolated \nremote areas. The cost of photovoltaic energy is $0.40\u20130.50/kilowatt-hour (kWh) at 20% load \nfactor with one day's worth of battery backup. The experience from run-of-the river hydropower \ngeneration shows costs of $0.06/kWh (Kyrgyz Republic) and  $0.04/kWh (Gansu, People\u2019s \nRepublic of China), which is as little as one tenth of grid generation. \n \n13.  To review the potential to use energy efficiency technologies, various types of energy \nneeds, and possible technology options, ADB approved a TA in December 2002.5 The TA will \nalso  support  basic  reforms  in  the  energy  sector  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  for \nUzbekistan. However, a more focused approach is needed to address off-grid renewable energy \noptions in rural areas and small towns in Uzbekistan. Use of efficient appliances will ensure that \nconsumers in remote rural areas receive maximum value from the limited supply. Increased \ngeneral awareness will also reduce wastage of national energy resources and put them to better \nuse. Increased use of renewable energy will provide a more stable energy supply in the rural \nareas. Rural households will benefit from increased agricultural income from improved irrigation, \ndecreased time spent on livelihood chores, increased alternative income sources, and more \nincome savings due to the increased use of cheap and more energy efficient appliances. \nRenewable energy sources are often environmentally friendly, reducing harmful environmental \npollution at the local level and bringing large amounts of global environmental benefits. Such \nsources are cost effective, especially in remote areas, compared with grid connected high cost \noptions.  \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n14.  The TA will undertake a comprehensive assessment of the potential for renewable \nenergy options in small towns and rural areas in Uzbekistan. The TA also aims to develop a \nviable pilot scheme of renewable energy options in selected off-grid areas. The expected \noutputs include (i) a review and assessment of the potential for renewable energy development, \n(ii) an action plan to improve renewable energy, (iii) designs of pilot projects for the most \nappropriate renewable energy options; (iv) detailed feasibility assessment for the increase of \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002.

The TA will have the following key activities:  \n \n(i)  analyze potential sources for renewable energy development in off-grid rural \nareas and  small towns; the analysis should cover the experience with similar \ninitiatives in other countries in the region; \n  \n(ii)  analyze the potential for development  of all other forms of energy in off-grid \nareas, and compare their relative merits; \n \n(iii)  list the demand management programs that could be used by the domestic and \nindustrial  sectors  while  strengthening  the  sustainability  of  renewable  energy \noptions;  \n \n(iv)  perform a detailed cost-benefit analysis for identified renewable energy options, \nincluding with and without options of demand management programs; \n \n(v)  prepare a detailed action plan (time-bound and incentive-based) to promote high \npriority renewable energy options, including appropriate demand management \nprograms; \n \n(vi)  within the action plan, prepare pilot schemes for five prioritized renewable options \nand two demand management options;  \n \n(vii)  assess the pilot schemes, identifying merits of technical, social, environmental, \nfinancial, and other decisive variables; \n \n(viii)  examine  the  institutional  mechanism,  in  particular  the  policy and regulatory \nframework, for promoting renewable energy options in off-grid rural areas and \nsmall towns;  \n \n(ix)  examine the feasibility of increasing pilot activities for renewable energy, with and \nwithout  demand  management  options,  including  innovative  financing \nmechanisms; \n \n(x)  prepare  a  report  assessing  renewable  energy  subsector  and  highlighting \n(a) means and ways of removing barriers, and (b) summarizing pre-feasibility \nstudy results indicating investment requirements for sector development; and  \n \n(xi)  disseminate the main results of the TA \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent with a foreign exchange \ncost of $305,000 and a local currency cost of $195,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $305,000 in foreign exchange cost and $45,000 equivalent in local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed by the Government of Denmark on a grant basis and to \n ", "  5\nbe administered by ADB. The Government will finance the remaining $150,000 equivalent in \nlocal currency cost. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are presented in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  MAWR is responsible for developing small-scale hydropower in Uzbekistan. MAWR will \nbe the Executing Agency for the TA.  The Department for External Economic Relations and \nForeign Investments of the Cabinet of Ministers (DEERFI) will provide an overall coordinating \nand advisory role to the TA. DEERFI, in consultation with ADB, will (i) assign a TA leader and \ncounterpart staff to work on the TA; and (ii) identify and establish a TA steering committee to \ncomprise representatives from relevant government agencies, nongovernment organizations, \nand other stakeholders. The steering committee will be headed by DEERFI official. Local-level \nparticipation when necessary will be assured through appointing appropriate local government \nrepresentatives to undertake appropriate tasks. \n \n18.  The TA will be carried out over a 6 month period by internationally recognized consulting \nfirms  or  institutes  in  association  with  domestic  consultants.  The  TA  will  commence  on \n30 October 2003 and will be completed by 30 April 2004. The total input of international and \ndomestic consultants will be about 8 and 10 person-months, respectively. The consultants will \nprocure and rent the equipment required for TA implementation, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. The international consultants for the TA will be recruited by ADB on \nthe basis of submission of simplified technical proposals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants  and using the quality and cost based selection procedure.  The \ndomestic consultants will also be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB and DEERFI for the engagement of \ndomestic  consultants.  ADB  will  finance  the  attendance  of  Government  observer(s)  at  the \ncontract negotiations, which will be held at ADB headquarters in Manila. The consulting firm will \nbe  required  to  have  the  following  consulting  positions:  (i)  renewable  energy  specialist, \n(ii) environmental specialist, (iii) economist, (iv) financial analyst, and (v) social development \nspecialist.
