THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed \nemergency assistance loans (EALs) to the Republic of Indonesia for the Emergency Assistance \nfor  Rehabilitation  and  Reconstruction  (EARR).  The  EARR  will  rehabilitate  and  reconstruct \neducation, water supply, and water resources infrastructure; ports and an airport.  \n \n2.  In line with the Master Plan for Recovery and Reconstruction for Central Sulawesi (the \nMaster Plan),1 the EARR will support the Government of Indonesia in building back better2 critical \ninfrastructure damaged by the devastating disasters in Central Sulawesi Province in September \n2018, where a 7.4-magnitude earthquake triggered a near-field tsunami, landslides, and major \nliquefaction. The proposed EALs respond to the government\u2019s formal request to the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) made on 3 May 2019, for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of critical \ninfrastructure in Central Sulawesi. \n \nII.  THE EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  Disaster Risk, Recent Disasters, and Damage and Losses \n \n3.  Disaster risk in Indonesia. Indonesia is exposed to a wide range of natural hazards\u2014\nearthquake, liquefaction,3 tsunami, volcanic eruptions, landslides, floods, and droughts. Disasters \ntriggered by natural hazards cause significant loss of life and destruction to physical assets. \nBetween 2005 and 2017, these disasters affected the lives of more than 11 million people. \nDisaster risk modeling estimates show that, over a longer period, Indonesia experiences an \naverage annual loss of about $9.2 billion as a consequence of natural hazards, mostly from floods, \nvolcanic eruptions, and earthquakes.4 These numbers are expected to increase as a result of \nclimate change and rapid uncontrolled development which will likely intensify the exposure of \nassets to hazards. \n \n4.  Recent disasters. On 28 September 2018, a 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck Central \nSulawesi Province in Indonesia.5 The earthquake triggered a series of cascading events: (i) a \nnear-field tsunami, which struck parts of the coasts in the city of Palu and the districts of Sigi, \nDonggala,  and  Parigu  Moutong;  (ii)  landslides;  and  (iii)  major  liquefaction,  which  affected \n1.4 million people. A total of 2,081 people died, 1,309 were missing, 4,438 injured, and more than \n200,000 people displaced.6 \n                                                 \n1  National Development Planning Ministry (BAPPENAS). 2018.

Geneva. \n5   On 5 August 2018, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake hit Lombok in West Nusa Tenggara Province which resulted in 515 \ndeaths, over 7,700 injuries, and displacement of over 430,000 people. As government resources are used for \nreconstruction of Lombok, the EARR will cover rehabilitation and reconstruction of Central Sulawesi Province only.  \n6  ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management. 2018. Situation Update No.15. \nJakarta. \n \n ", "2 \n5.  Damages and losses. The National Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB) identified severe \ndamage to housing, infrastructure, and livelihoods. Government estimates show that the damage \nand losses from the Central Sulawesi disasters reached Rp24.11 trillion ($1.70 billion equivalent); \nthe heaviest damage was to housing, water supply, irrigation, roads, bridges, airport, and ports. \nTable 1 summarizes the damage, losses, and needs for public and private assets.7 The damage \nis higher than the losses, highlighting the physical destruction of assets and the need for \nrehabilitation and reconstruction. \n \nTable 1: Damage, Losses, and Needs (Central Sulawesi, 2018) \n(Rp million) \nSector  Damage  Losses  Total  Needs \nSettlements  7,162,479  1,659,407  8,821,886   7,621,751 \nInfrastructure  5,399,822  1,194,287  6,594,108  18,386,649 \nSocial  1,972,702  84,572  2,057,274  4,848,030 \nEconomic  4,354,117  1,900,059  6,254,175  3,860,825 \nCrosscutting  361,845  17,840  379,685  1,514,258 \n   Total  19,250,965  4,856,165  24,107,128  36,231,513 \nSources: Government of Indonesia, National Disaster Mitigation Agency \n(BNPB), and United Nations Development Programme. \n \n2.  Impact on Economy, Poverty, and Gender \n \n6.  Macroeconomic impact. The gross regional domestic product for Central Sulawesi is \nexpected to fall by 4.5% and the economy is not likely to recover to pre-disaster levels until 2021.8 \nADB estimates suggest a potential negative impact on the national growth rate as high as 0.1% \nof gross regional domestic product for 2019, representing losses of Rp16.2 trillion ($1.1 billion \nequivalent). \n \n7.  Impact on poverty. In March 2018, before the disasters, the percentage of the population \nliving below the poverty line was 14.0% in Central Sulawesi\u2014high compared with the national \naverage of 9.82%.9 The poverty gap is also substantially higher than the national average. This \nsuggests that the poor are likely to be pushed deeper into poverty because of the disasters. ADB \nestimates suggest an increase in the poverty incidence from 14.0% before to 16.6% after the \ndisasters in Central Sulawesi. \n \n8.  Gender impact. The impact of the disasters is particularly acute for women and girls. The \nInternational Organization for Migration estimated that more than half of the Central Sulawesi \ninhabitants internally displaced because of the disasters are women. Of the 1.4 million people \naffected by the disasters, more than 350,000 are women of reproductive age at increased risk of \nsexual and gender-based violence; and 45,300 were pregnant during the time of the disasters. \nFollowing the disasters, the burden of work on women and the time spent on household and \ncaring responsibilities are likely to have increased. If women are involved in leading the recovery \nand reconstruction, they can become important agents of change. \n \n                                                 \n7  Damage is the replacement costs of physical assets and infrastructure totally or partially destructed in the affected \nareas; losses are changes in economic flows arising from the disaster which continue until the achievement of full \nrecovery and reconstruction; and needs is the amount of finance required to reconstruct the damaged infrastructure \nand physical assets to higher standards of resilience.

Human settlements and associated infrastructure. The disasters damaged public \nbuildings (government buildings, schools, hospitals, and health centers); private housing; and \nurban infrastructure facilities (water supply and sanitation system): \n(i)  About 68,200 houses were partially damaged or destroyed across Palu, Donggala, \nSigi, and Parigu Moutong, leading to significant displacement. Since reconstruction \nis impossible in the liquefaction-affected areas, new sites need to be identified for \nthe relocation of affected households. \n(ii)  About 1,500 educational institutions were damaged, of which 318 were severely \ndamaged. The damages in educational institutions resulted in losses, including \ndisruption in the academic calendar because of school closures and arrangements \nfor temporary schools. \n(iii)  67 health centers and 17 hospitals were damaged in Central Sulawesi, hampering \nhealth service delivery and the response to the expected outbreak of diseases, such \nas dengue and malaria. \n(iv)  Prior to the disasters, about 23,000 households in Palu city were connected to a \npiped water system. As a result of damage to water intakes, water treatment plants, \nand the water supply network, it is estimated that currently, only about 10,000 \nhouseholds  are  connected  to  a  piped  water  system,  resulting  in  increased \ndependence on groundwater sources that could be contaminated by the corpses of \nvictims buried in liquefaction sites. \n \n10.  Water  resources  and  associated  infrastructure.  About  42  km  of  the  Palu\u2013Sigi\u2013\nDonggala (PASIGALA) raw water transmission was damaged, compromising water supply to all \nthree centers. In addition, the Gumbasa irrigation system, supplying a command area of 8,180 \nhectares, was destroyed, leaving 5,000 farmers without access to irrigation water for the 2019 \nplanting season. The farmers lost their 2018 harvest and harvests for the next two seasons are \ncompromised, with an estimated yield loss of 48,000 tons per harvest. The damages to 16 km of \nriver ways and 20 km of coastal protection exposed about 30,000 households to flood risks.  \n \n11.  Connectivity and transport infrastructure. The disasters damaged at least 100 km of \nroad network and 11 bridges in Central Sulawesi. The 2,500-meter runway at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri \nAirport, the main airport in Central Sulawesi, suffered significant damage along its entire length, \nleaving only a 2,250-meter section of runway available for aircraft operations. The airport\u2019s \nterminal building, warehouse, control tower, and other structures suffered serious damage and \nnow pose safety risks to occupants. Damage to marine facilities, backup and storage areas, and \nbuildings significantly reduced operations at the ports of Pantoloan, Donggala, and Wani. The \ndamaged transportation infrastructure severely limits rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. \n \n4.  Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Strategy \n \n12.  Government\u2019s rehabilitation and reconstruction strategy. The government finalized \nthe Master Plan in December 2018; the National Development Planning Ministry (BAPPENAS) \nled the process in coordination with other line agencies, including the Ministry of Public Works \nand Housing (MPWH), the Ministry of Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning, the Ministry of Energy \nand Mineral Resources, BNPB, and the Geospatial Information Agency. Recognizing that the \nliquefaction-prone areas in Central Sulawesi are not suitable for reconstruction, the Master Plan \nidentifies the relocation sites for planning by the MPWH. \n \n ", "4 \n13.  Development partner coordination. While an early recovery cluster led by the BNPB \nand  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  supported  the  provincial  government  in \nassessing the post-disaster and recovery needs, BAPPENAS took the lead in coordinating with \nthe main development partners\u2014including ADB, the Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA), German development cooperation through KfW, and the World Bank\u2014to finance the \nlarger rehabilitation and reconstruction needs. Development partners closely coordinate efforts \nboth in Jakarta and in Central Sulawesi. The World Bank\u2019s proposed support covers housing and \nassociated infrastructure and social sectors; JICA\u2019s proposed support covers master planning, \nroads, bridges and water resources infrastructure. 10 \n \n14.  ADB support for response and recovery. ADB\u2019s immediate support to the government \nwas comprehensive and comprised: \n(i)  an emergency grant from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund, approved in \nOctober 2018 and utilized by BNPB for provision of support to victims of the \ndisasters;11 and \n(ii)  a quick-disbursing loan for Emergency Assistance for Recovery and Rehabilitation \nfrom Recent Disasters,12 approved in November 2018 and fully disbursed in \nJanuary 2019 to support the immediate and near-term financing requirements for \nrecovery in Lombok and Central Sulawesi, such as temporary schools, cash \ntransfer for victims, livelihood assistance, and training and skills development; ADB \nis currently supporting the government in monitoring and evaluation including \nfinancial reporting of the above activities.  \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s  support  for  reconstruction.  ADB  continued  to  support  the  government  in \npreparing for the reconstruction of critical infrastructure through various resources that comprised: \n(i)  technical  assistance  (TA)  grants  from  various  sources  that  supported  the \ngovernment in undertaking the post-disaster needs assessment, and preparing the \nMaster Plan and a framework for monitoring the Master Plan\u2019s implementation;13 \n(ii)  funds from two ongoing loans\u2014Accelerating Infrastructure Delivery through Better \nEngineering Services Project14 and Flood Management in Selected River Basins \nSector Project15\u2014to prepare detailed engineering designs for water resources and \nurban infrastructure facilities under the EARR; and \n(iii)  inputs from ADB\u2019s knowledge partners16 and ADB staff to assist government \nagencies in planning and preparing reconstruction works. \n                                                 \n10 Emergency Assistance Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) provides more \ninformation on coordination and division of tasks among development partners. \n11 ADB. 2018.

The European Space Agency provided mapping services that supported the formulation of the Master \nPlan.  The  Asian  Institute  of  Technology,  Bangkok  helped  interpret  satellite  images  and  supported  needs \nassessments. \n \n ", "5 \n \n16.  Extended emergency phase. The government extended the emergency phase twice, \nand the transition to the reconstruction phase did not occur until 24 April 2019. The extensions \nwere justified by the complexity of the disaster impacts including complications from liquefaction, \nrequiring coordination between central and local government agencies on exposure to future \nnatural disasters, damage assessments, response options, and alignment of the Master Plan for \nreconstruction; and coordination and consolidation of the assistance packages proposed by the \ndevelopment financing agencies involved.  \n \n17.  Modality. The proposed EALs use the sector lending approach, which is considered most \nappropriate because it (i) will support the government in implementing the sector priorities of the \nMaster Plan; (ii) is designed to provide assistance to ease the transition from recovery to normal \ndevelopment through quick support for reconstruction; and (iii) will allow a quick response and \nmaximum flexibility in selecting multiple priority subprojects within the agreed criteria.17  \n \n5.  Strategic Alignment and Value Addition \n \n18.  Lessons from post-disaster reconstruction. A review of ADB-wide experience with \nemergency assistance indicates the following lessons: (i) projects must be prepared in line with \nthe government\u2019s reconstruction planning process and timeline, and should focus on priority \ninfrastructure; (ii) as implementation places a heavy burden on executing and implementing \nagencies, strong consulting support and ADB supervision are needed during implementation; (iii) \nthe criteria for subproject selection should permit simple prioritization of subprojects and demand \nshort implementation periods; and (iv) reconstruction should feature build-back-better principles. \n \n19.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s strategy. The EARR contributes to the objectives of ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for Indonesia, 2016\u20132019.18 It is consistent with the operational \npriorities  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030\u2014poverty  alleviation,  gender  equality,  climate  change \nadaptation, disaster resilience and environmental sustainability, and promoting rural development \nand food security.19 The EARR also promotes a stronger, faster, and integrated response based \non prior experience and knowledge of disaster response approaches, and is delivered through a \nOne ADB team.20 \n \n20.  Value addition of ADB\u2019s engagement.

Impact and Outcome \n \n22.  The  EARR  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  socioeconomic  impact  of  disasters \nreduced.22 The EARR will have the following outcome: access for affected people, including \nwomen and children, to resilient and inclusive infrastructure restored.23 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n23.  The EARR has two components covering critical infrastructure investments. The selection \nof outputs was determined by (i) the extent of damage suffered by different sectors, and (ii) close \nconsultation with government and development partners to ensure minimal overlap in the overall \nsupport. In line with the sector lending approach, potential subprojects to be financed under the \nEARR  will need to comply with the applicable selection criteria as included in the project \nadministration manuals (PAMs).24 \n \n24.  Component 1: Public works infrastructure: \n(i)  Output 1: Human settlement infrastructure constructed, rehabilitated, and \nupgraded. The output will construct, rehabilitate, and/or upgrade (a) education \nfacilities,25  and  (b)  water  supply  (treatment  and  distribution  facilities)  \niinfrastructure. The facilities will be built back better to higher standards of disaster \nresilience, which will ensure that risks from future hazards are reduced through \nstructural design features. At the same time, nonstructural measures such as \ndisaster preparedness plans will also be implemented. The output will ensure that \nsustainability plans are in place and the capacity of agencies is strengthened to \nbetter manage water supply services. \n(ii)  Output  2:  Water  resource  infrastructure  constructed,  rehabilitated,  and \nupgraded. The output will (a) reconstruct the Gumbasa irrigation system, (b) \nreconstruct  and  upgrade  the  PASIGALA  raw  water  supply  system,  and  (c) \nconstruct coastal protection to prevent erosion and tidal flooding. Where possible, \nnature-based solutions will be promoted. The river basin organization will be \nstrengthened to better design resilient infrastructure, improve the O&M of assets, \nand stay equipped with hydrometeorological instruments for managing water flows \nacross the river basin. \n                                                 \n21 Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction is a possible funding source subject to the approval of the Government of Japan. \n22 Government of Indonesia.

A national steering committee comprising the Ministry of Finance, \nBAPPENAS, the MPWH, the Ministry of Transportation (MOT), and the Ministry of Religious \nAffairs will guide the EARR implementation. A provincial coordinating committee comprising the \ngovernor, district and city heads, and related sector agencies will support EARR implementation. \nBoth committees will also ensure coordination with other ministries and development partners, \nand communication with stakeholders. \n \n31.  Executing agencies and implementing agencies. The MPWH will be the executing \nagency for component 1, and MOT for component 2. The MPWH\u2019s Directorate General of Human \nSettlements will be the implementing agency for output 1. The Directorate General of Water \nResources, MPWH, will be the implementing agency for output 2. Two project implementation \nunits (PIUs) will be established in Palu: the Central Sulawesi Settlement Infrastructure Agency of \nthe Directorate General of Human Settlements, and the River Basin Organization (Balai Wilayah \nSungai) Sulawesi III of the Directorate General of Water Resources.

Central project management units will \nbe established in the MPWH and MOT.  \n \n32.  Consultant support. The MPWH will recruit a project management consultant using the \nproposed EAL proceeds for EARR management. MOT\u2019s project management capability will be \nsupplemented by consultants funded by EARR and ADB\u2019s technical assistance resources.28 \nP P\nEngineering and management consultants at MPWH implementing agencies and consulting firms \nat MOT implementing agencies will support the implementation of safeguard measures and the \ngender  action  plan  (GAP),  support  financial  management,  and  undertake  construction \nsupervision. \n \n33.

Procurement of goods, works, and consulting services will be carried out in a manner \nconsistent with the simplified and expedient procedures of ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency \nAssistance Policy (2004), ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time), and \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n35.  Civil works and goods contracts will be awarded through open competitive bidding using \nthe national or international advertisement method as applicable. The national electronic public \nprocurement system may be used, provided the system accommodates necessary modifications \nto comply with ADB requirements. Post review (sampling) will be applied for most procurement \npackages. All procurement packages under MOT and all contract packages above $40 million \nand all first packages under the MPWH will follow ADB prior review. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n36.  EARR  will  consider  disaster  risk,  climate  hazards,  build-back-better  principles,  and \ngender-sensitive and inclusive features. Development control regulations and building codes will \nconsider flooding, tsunami, and seismic hazards. Disaster preparedness plans will be developed \nin consultation with the respective stakeholders. Subproject selection will follow the agreed \nselection criteria (footnote 17), and the design will (i) consider technical alternatives and select \noptions based on least lifecycle cost and economic viability; (ii) maximize support to communities \nand minimize adverse environmental and social impacts; and (iii) optimize implementation period. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n37.  The EARR is likely to generate significant social and economic benefits to the affected \npopulation by restoring access to education facilities, water supply services, irrigation, ports, and \nthe airport. However, because of the short time between receiving the financing request from the \ngovernment and processing the EARR, it was not possible to collect data and undertake full \neconomic  due  diligence  prior  to  seeking  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  approval.  Therefore, \neconomic due diligence will be conducted on all subprojects during EARR implementation in line \nwith ADB guidelines on economic analysis to ensure that the subprojects are economically viable. \n \n38.  EARR-restored infrastructure will be maintained using the respective ministries\u2019 recurrent \nbudget. The EARR will ensure that O&M processes and capacity are in place to optimize \ninvestment sustainability. Financial due diligence, including detailed cost estimates, financing \nplan, and financial analysis (recurrent cost analysis for nonrevenue-generating subprojects), will \nbe conducted for each subproject as per the requirements listed in the PAMs. \n \n \n \n ", "11 \nC.  Governance \n \n39.  The  EARR  implementation  and  financial  management  will  be  aligned  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s standard operating procedures. The overall procurement classification for the \n \nEARR is medium risk (category medium). The premitigated financial management risk level for \nthe  EARR  is  high  because  of  the  complex  implementation  arrangements  and  the  limited \nexperience of some implementing agencies with management of ADB projects. \n \n40.  Following a financial management assessment, risks were identified and are addressed \nthrough mitigation measures in the Financial Management, Internal Control, Risk Assessment \nand Mitigating Action Plan,30 which will be closely monitored during EARR implementation. \nF P\nOverall, EARR has a high risk of not applying adequate financial management systems and \ncontrols because of its focus on quick implementation. The executing agencies will assign a \nfinancial management specialist to provide support and oversight during implementation and to \nensure that risks and mitigation activities are identified and executed in a timely fashion. \n \n41.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and ADB's Integrity Principles \n \nand Guidelines were explained to and discussed with the government.31 The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAMs (footnote 29). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n42.  By restoring access to critical infrastructure, the EARR is expected to help mitigate the \nadverse poverty, social and gender impacts of the disasters on the affected population. While \noutputs under component 1 will help restore livelihoods and address food security and health, \noutputs under component 2 will help rehabilitate key infrastructure to support access to markets \nand facilitate trade.  \n \n43.  The EARR is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming at entry, and its GAP32 will: \n(i)  promote  local  consultations  with  women  (45%  women\u2019s  participation)  in  the \nrehabilitation and reconstruction process; \n(ii)  integrate gender-responsive and inclusive physical design features and/or safety \nmeasures for women, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities in the \nrehabilitated or reconstructed infrastructure; and \n(iii)  develop  safety  standards  for  disaster-resilient  infrastructure  and/or  disaster \npreparedness and response plans. \n \n44.  The GAP was prepared to support BNPB Regulation No. 13 Year 2014 on Gender \nMainstreaming  in  Disaster  Management,  which  mandates  gender-responsive  planning  and \nbudgeting during rehabilitation and reconstruction. \n   \n                                                 \n30 Included in the Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 ADB. 2015.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the EARR\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are detailed below.33 The EARR follows a sector lending approach, and safeguards \nplanning  documents  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  agreed  frameworks.  Subprojects \nclassified as category A for environment, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous people are not \neligible for financing by the proposed EALs.34 \n \n46.  Environment  (category  B).  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework \n(EARF)35 was prepared and disclosed on 29 May 2019, following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement as well as government laws and regulations. Subprojects in protected areas, including \nthose either legally protected or officially proposed for protection, will not be considered.36 Initial \nenvironmental examinations and environmental management plans will be prepared consistent \nwith the EARF, and will be incorporated in contract documents to be implemented by contractors \nand monitored by the implementing agencies. \n \n47.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). A Resettlement and Customary Communities \nDevelopment Framework (RCCDF)37 that combines the involuntary resettlement framework with \nthe indigenous people\u2019s development framework was prepared and disclosed on 29 May 2019 \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  as  well  as  government  laws  and  regulations. \nResettlement plans and indigenous people\u2019s development plans will be prepared consistent with \nthe RCCDF. The start of civil works and/or restrictions to the use of land resources will not be \nallowed unless customary communities are fully compensated, and all entitlements provided.38 \n \n48.  Indigenous people (category B). The EARR will ensure that indigenous people affected \nby the disasters will receive culturally appropriate social and economic benefits, participate \nactively in the EARR, and not suffer adverse impacts as a result of the EARR.39 \n \n49.  The EARR consultants will include environment and resettlement specialists to support \nsafeguard screening, preparation, and implementation of safeguard plans consistent with the \nEARF and the RCCDF. Consultants supporting the PIUs will collate and submit semiannual \nmonitoring reports (one for the environment and one for involuntary resettlement) that describe \nprogress of safeguard implementation, compliance issues, and corrective actions. Reports will be \nposted on the executing agencies\u2019 websites and made accessible to affected people. The \nexecuting agencies will establish a grievance redress mechanism to facilitate the resolution of \ncomplaints relating to safeguards. \n \n                                                 \n33 ADB.
