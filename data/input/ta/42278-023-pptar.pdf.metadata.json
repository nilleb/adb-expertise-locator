The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  project  preparatory  technical \nassistance (PPTA) in the amount of $500,000 to prepare the project. The PPTA will assist the \ngovernment to prepare a project eligible for ADB financing in line with government policy and \nstrategies and ADB requirements in terms of technical, financial, economic, institutional, sector \npolicy, and safeguard dimensions, and to provide capacity development and other support to \nensure a rapid start-up of the implementation. The PPTA design will support the Ministry of \nEducation and Sports (MOES) to establish a format for the school development plans (SDP) to \nbe  prepared  by  school  management  in  close  collaboration  with  companies  or  community \nmembers, and procedures for the stipend scheme to support students from low income families. \nGiven  the  range  of  interventions  proposed,  the  project  will  also  require  considerable \nconsultation with MOES and stakeholder groups such as employers, business associations, and \ncommunities to ensure that investments will be in line with the current and future demand for \ntechnical and vocational skills. Lessons learned from the ongoing technical and vocational \neducation  and  training  (TVET)  project1 will  inform  the  design  work  and  implementation \narrangements.   \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.
