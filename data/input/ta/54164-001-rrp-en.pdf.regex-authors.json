THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed senior \nsecured debt financing of up to $58,000,000 (in Indian rupee equivalent) to IIFL Home Finance \nLimited (IIFLHF) for the IIFLHF Supporting Access to Affordable Green Housing for Women \nProject in India. The report also describes the proposed administration of a loan of up to \n$10,000,000 in Indian rupee equivalent to IIFLHF to be provided by the Canadian Climate Fund \nfor the Private Sector in Asia (CFPS) for the IIFLHF Supporting Access to Affordable Green \nHousing for Women Project, and if the Board approves the proposed senior secured debt \nfinancing, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration \nof the loan.1 \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) longer-tenor debt financing will help IIFLHF to \nprovide housing loans to women borrowers in economically weaker sections (EWSs) and low-\nincome groups (LIGs),2 of which 20% will be toward financing green-certified homes3 in Tier 2 \nand Tier 3 cities.4 Concessional financing from the CFPS of up to $10,000,000 in Indian rupee \nequivalent will be onlent to qualified developers for the construction of green-certified, climate-\nresilient affordable housing5 through blended finance in a ratio of up to 40:60 (CFPS:IIFLHF\u2019s own \nfunds). \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Affordable housing and housing finance. Limited housing supply adversely affects the \nliving conditions of lower-income households, especially in large cities characterized by low \nbuilding standards. The shortage of housing units in India is estimated at 18.7 million in urban \nareas and 43.7 million in rural areas.6 More than 90% of this deficit is projected to be in the lower-\nincome segment. The Government of India launched the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) \ninitiative in 2015, with a target of building 20 million affordable homes for the urban poor by 2022.7 \nTo date, about 11.3 million homes have been sanctioned.8 Under the PMAY, the government \noffers interest rate subsidies of 3.0%\u20136.5%, depending on the loan amount and the income \n \n1  The CFPS, a fund supported by the Government of Canada and administered by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), aims to support private sector participation in climate change mitigation and adaptation in low and lower \nmiddle-income countries and upper middle-income small island developing states in Asia and the Pacific. \n2  Government of India, Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (MOHUA). 2017. Pradhan Mantri Awas \nYojana (PMAY). New Delhi. An EWS household is defined as having a family income of less than \u20b90.3 million per \nannum, an LIG household as having a family income of \u20b90.3 million\u2013\u20b90.6 million per annum, and a middle-income \ngroup household as having a family income of up to \u20b91.8 million per annum. For this report and recommendation of \nthe President, lower-income households refer to EWSs and LIGs. \n3  Certifications eligible for the project are either the Green Rating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA) at a \nminimum four-star level or the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) at a minimum gold (affordable) level.

Banks  dominate  the  finance  sector,  with  the  assets  of \ncommercial banks totaling more than 64% of financial system assets.9 Public sector banks hold \nnearly 60% of all banking assets. Nonbank financial companies (NBFCs) comprised about 20% \nof overall systemic credit as of FY2020 in India, serving segments that typically are underserved \nor not catered to by banks.10 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had 9,484 NBFCs registered as of \n31 May 2021. Despite the size of the banking industry, poor access to financial services remains \na key issue in India, with 20.1% of people unbanked.11 Access to credit is even more limited, with \nless than 6.6% of the population accessing credit via formal channels.12 Asset quality varies, with \nhigher gross nonperforming assets (NPAs) for public sector banks at 9.5% as compared with \n4.6% for private sector banks as of 31 March 2021. Asset quality improved, in part because of a \nloan moratorium extended by the RBI and restructuring of certain accounts, with gross NPAs for \nthe banks decreasing from 9.3% in fiscal year (FY) 2019 to 7.5% as of FY2021. The NPAs of \nNBFCs improved from 6.6% in FY2019 to 6.4% in FY2021. \n \n5.  Housing finance sector. Given borrowers\u2019 constrained access to credit and the limited \navailability of long-term funds for financial institutions offering home loans, mortgage penetration \nin India was 11.6% as of FY2021, much lower than in other emerging markets such as the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (27.9%), Malaysia (35.4%) and Thailand (23.9%).13 The total volume \nof outstanding housing credit in India was about \u20b922.8 trillion as of FY2021.14 Most commercial \nbanks provide mortgage lending, but the affordable housing segment has not been a primary \ntarget as banks have concentrated on salaried employees in urban areas. Regulated by the RBI, \nthe 91 housing finance companies (HFCs) are solely mandated to fund housing. HFCs are a \nsignificant player in mortgage financing, but their share declined from 38% in FY2018 to 33.0% \nas of FY 2021, because of the continued liquidity stress facing the nonbank sector, competition \nfrom banks, and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.15 The asset quality (NPAs) \namong the HFCs deteriorated to 2.9% in FY2021 from 2.4% in FY2020, and is expected to \ndeteriorate further in light of the pandemic, potentially rising by 30\u201360 basis points in FY2022. \n \n6.  Underserved  home  loan  borrower  segments.  Lower-income  households  are \nparticularly constrained in obtaining mortgages because of the lack of formal documents to prove \ntheir income source, high credit evaluation costs, perceived higher credit risk, lack of proximity to \na bank branch, and high origination costs because of the relatively small loan size. As a result, \nsuch households typically fund their homes through savings, borrowings from family and friends, \nor loans from local moneylenders at usurious interest rates. Women find it particularly difficult to \nobtain mortgage loans to meet their housing needs, as men dominate land and home ownership. \nA survey of land ownership carried out in 2016 by ADB in northern and eastern India indicated \nthat women owned only 3.6% of plots, men owned 85.9%, and the remaining 10.5% were \n \n9  India Brand Equity Foundation. 2021.

", "3 \nuntitled.16 Lack of property ownership directly contributes to the low social status of women, \nvulnerability to poverty, and low bargaining power within households.17 Recognizing the issues \nrelated to low levels of women\u2019s property ownership, several states in India have provided tax \nincentives for women holding property titles. Female access to finance in India is also extremely \nlow, with only 5.0% of women reported to have borrowed from a formal financial institution and \nonly 3.0% having an outstanding housing loan (footnote 12). \n \n7.  Green housing and climate risks. In addition to the affordable housing deficit and \nchallenges faced by LIGs to access mortgage credit, another key development concern is the \nneed to construct environmentally sustainable (green) and resilient buildings. Buildings and \nconstruction account for an average of 39% of carbon emissions; reducing these emissions is \ntherefore crucial to achieve India\u2019s ambitious emission reduction targets of 33%\u201335% by 2030.18 \nIn addition, India faces high climate risks, including risks from extreme weather events, which \nresult in many fatalities and absolute economic loss ($37.8 billion in 2018).19 Environmental \nconcerns are exacerbated by the fact that more than 60 million people live in dwellings unfit for \nhuman habitation, which lack basic services, are vulnerable to climate risks (floods, storms, and \nheat stress), and are a significant driver of pollution given uncontrolled dumping of waste, open \nsewage, cooking fuel practices, and groundwater pollution. While India\u2019s green building market is \ngrowing (from fewer than 100 registered projects in 2009 to more than 6,781 projects in 2021),20 \n98% of the existing green building stock is for commercial use.21 This is primarily because (i) \nhomebuyers focus on the higher construction costs (of up to 8%), particularly in the affordable \nsegment, and are not aware of the long-term operational savings (of up to 37%) of green buildings; \nand (ii) housing developers lack (a) the experience and knowledge to develop climate-resilient \nbuildings as well as (b) adequate finance to undertake more expensive green construction \nmethods. The combination of these two factors has led to a low supply of green affordable \nhousing. \n \n8.  India has developed its own green building rating and certification systems: the Green \nRating for Integrated Habitat Assessment (GRIHA), which also includes a specific certification for \naffordable green housing, and the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) rating systems (footnote \n3), both of which grant credit for the implementation of climate mitigation and adaptation measures \nin construction design, such as criteria for site selection and building design and materials, \nreduction in energy and water consumption, and other features that enhance resilience to climate \nchange and reduce carbon emissions. These rating systems have been reviewed by an external \nexpert to confirm that the proposed certification standards are deemed to be consistent with \nclimate  adaptation  and  resilience  outcomes.22 In  addition,  ADB  has  reviewed  the  climate \nmitigation aspects of the green-certified construction to ensure compliance with greenhouse gas-\nreducing construction methods. \n \n \n16 H.

To address the need to improve affordable housing finance, particularly for \nwomen and lower-income households, ADB has identified HFC partners with demonstrated ability \nto reach such households on a sustainable basis. ADB has provided funding to HFCs in India in \nthe past,23 and this project addresses lessons learned from the portfolio to target 100% women \nborrowers in the EWS and LIG segments. As such, IIFLHF encourages women to be borrowers \nor co-borrowers for housing finance and is one of the top facilitators in India of the government\u2019s \nCredit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) program, which mandates that at least one female family \nmember be registered as the owner of the property for which the loan is secured. More than 35% \nof IIFLHF\u2019s portfolio are CLSS beneficiaries.24  Further, through the proposed CFPS funding, the \nproject promotes the supply of green-certified affordable housing to improve climate mitigation \nand adaptation in residential construction. IIFLHF is one of the pioneering HFCs focused on \nsustainable housing, with a strategy to finance loans for green-certified homes in the affordable \nhousing segment. IIFLHF is supported by an established and reputable promoter group, IIFL \nFinance Limited (IIFL), which has an extensive NBFC branch network of 2,563 branches in 25 \nstates and in-depth market knowledge across retail segments. About 70% of IIFLHF\u2019s loans are \nto low-income households, and 95% of its loans have women as co-borrowers. \n \n10.  Through the proposed CFPS tranche, the project will support the growth of IIFLHF\u2019s green \naffordable  housing  portfolio,  and  funding  will  be  provided  only  to  developers  with  GRIHA \n(minimum four-star level) or IGBC (minimum gold [affordable] level) certification (footnote 3). \nBased on the external expert review (footnote 22), up to 45% of the criteria points for green-\ncertified affordable housing at the GRIHA four-star level or better or the IGBC gold level or better \ncontribute to climate adaptation. The climate adaptation for the project is estimated to be 25% of \ngreen building construction cost associated with certification, and consequently $8.9 million of the \nCFPS finance is to be tagged as climate adaptation. A further ADB review of the GRIHA \ncertification methods also noted the elements that are consistent with climate mitigation, including \nenergy optimization, adapted waste management treatment, and use of sustainable building \nmaterials. Consequently, the remaining $1.1 million of the project cost funded by ADB from the \nCFPS is to be tagged as climate mitigation. The funding support to be provided by ADB will \nincrease the supply of green-certified affordable housing units, and the share of IIFLHF\u2019s portfolio \nin  developer  loans  for  affordable,  green-certified  housing.  The  increase  in  green-certified \naffordable housing supply and ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources loan will also contribute to \nIIFLHF\u2019s ability to increase the share of its green-certified affordable mortgage portfolio \n \nB.

IIFL is a diversified retail finance NBFC with \u20b9447 billion in assets under management \n(AUM) as of FY 2021 and has a granular book spread across gold loans, home loans, business \nloans, and microfinance. IIFLHF is a retail HFC that primarily lends to customers in the affordable \nhousing segment. Housing loans contribute 69.7% to its AUM, and another 26.0% consists of \nsecured loans to small, and medium-sized enterprises backed by property (loans against property \n(LAPs). In addition, IIFLHF offers builder loans, which form 4.2% of its AUM. Mortgage loans have \nan average loan size of \u20b91.7 million and a maximum tenor of 19 years whereas LAPs have an \naverage loan size of \u20b92.8 million with a maximum tenor of 11 years. The average loan-to-value \n(LTV) ratio of home loans is about 71% whereas that for LAPs is 47%. The builder loans, on the \nother hand, are typically given for 4\u20135 years and the average loan amount size is \u20b9270 million. \n \n12.  Business strategy. IIFLHF had total AUM of \u20b9206.9 billion as of FY2021 (growth of 11.9% \nfrom FY2020). It operates out of 125 branches across 18 states, mainly in peri-urban and urban \nareas. IIFLHF had 1,434 full time employees as of FY 2021. The largest contribution to its portfolio \nis from Delhi (28.4%), followed by Maharashtra (21.6%), and Gujarat (9.8%). More than 70.0% of \nits loans (by number of clients, 56.0% by volume) are to EWS and LIG customers.

IIFLHF  will  embed  gender-inclusive  design  concepts  into  the  awareness  raising \ncampaign about sustainable development in the affordable housing sector.26 As of March 2021, \n1.7% of IIFLHF\u2019s housing loan AUM were for green affordable homes and 4.6% of its construction \nloan AUM were to developers for the construction of certified green affordable housing. While the \nsize of its green housing portfolio is small, IIFLHF seeks to use the Kutumb network to build \nawareness about the need for and benefits of building and buying green-certified affordable \nhomes to mitigate climate risks and maximize savings of energy and other vital resources. ADB \nwill be supporting IIFLHF\u2019s capacity to promote green-certified affordable housing construction \nthrough the technical assistance (TA) funded by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund \n(UCCRTF) and the concessional finance application from the CFPS, structured in parallel to the \nADB loan (para. 32). \n \nC.

The Assistance \n \n22.  The ADB assistance consists of a senior secured debt financing of up to $58 million in \nIndian rupee equivalent with a tenor of up to 8 years and a senior secured debt financing of up to \n$10 million in Indian rupee equivalent with a tenor of up to 9 years funded by the CFPS. The ADB \nfinancing will be in the form of two separate issuances of nonconvertible debentures with a legal \ncharge on the security provided on a pari passu basis with other lenders.29 Both the ordinary \ncapital resources and the CFPS funds will be disbursed in full. ADB may enter risk transfers with \neligible counterparties for a portion of the exposure. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  Use of proceeds. IIFLHF will use the proceeds of ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nfinancing to provide housing finance to EWS and LIG households. The entire ADB loan amount \nwill be onlent to women as primary borrowers or as co-borrowers in the EWS and LIG segments, \nand 20% of the loan amount will be toward financing mortgages for green-certified homes. \nFunding from the CFPS will be onlent to developers exclusively for the construction of green-\ncertified affordable housing units. \n \n24.  Reporting arrangements. ADB will monitor the project throughout its duration.30 IIFLHF \nwill report regularly with (i) quarterly unaudited financial statements, (ii) annual audited financial \nstatements, (iii) quarterly loan portfolio and covenant reports, (iv) annual development indicators \nagreed  between  ADB  and  IIFLHF, (v) annual  reports  on  safeguards  and  social  protection \ncompliance,  (vi) annual progress reports on the implementation of the gender action plan (GAP) \nand (vii) a subloan report detailing the use of proceeds of the ADB loan. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n25.  Access to housing for underserved segments and women. India\u2019s mortgage markets \nare still underdeveloped, and lower-income segments lack access to mortgage finance. Housing \nis also a strong contributor to employment. According to an ADB study, \u20b910 million invested in \nconstruction creates 22,000 unskilled, 23,000 skilled and semiskilled, and 9,000 managerial and \ntechnical  person  workdays  in  India.31 As  up  to  40%  of  Indian  homes  in  urban  areas  are \nnonpermanent, this loan targets extending access to affordable permanent quality housing to \nlower-income segments, representing an inclusive business model. As a result of the project, the \nmarket for housing loans will be also extended toward women in the EWS and LIG segments. \nADB will also help IIFLHF enhance the development of women-friendly amenities in its project \nsites and implement gender sensitivity considerations into affordable housing finance. \n \n \n29 A nonconvertible debenture is a debt security with a fixed rate of interest and specified tenor, which is not convertible \nto equity. The security includes eligible receivables that meet the following criteria: receivables that (i) are in the \n\u201cstandard\u201d  or  equivalent  category  under  the  borrower\u2019s  asset  classification  system  and  (ii)  have  not  been \nrestructured. \n30 Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 J.

Access  to  climate-resilient  green  affordable  housing.  Despite  ongoing  efforts  to \npromote green-certified buildings, only 5% of buildings in India are green, 98% of which are for \ncommercial use. Low uptake of green-certified residential buildings is primarily driven by the \nstrong focus of homebuyers and developers on up-front construction cost, which is higher for \ngreen-certified buildings. The proposed CFPS concessional loan will address this issue through \nenabling IIFLHF to provide construction loans at a commercially viable interest rate. In addition, \nCFPS funds will be earmarked for the use of onlending for the construction of affordable homes \nfor EWS and LIG customers, where the housing deficit is greatest. To overcome some of the \nchallenges associated with promoting the increased supply of and demand for green-certified \naffordable housing, ADB is administering a $1 million parallel TA project funded by the Urban \nClimate Change Resilience Trust Fund to undertake several green affordable housing ecosystem \nbuilding activities.32  \n \n27.  Access to longer-tenor local currency debt. IIFLHF has an ongoing need for long-term \ndebt to fund high demand for mortgages targeting low-income households. IIFLHF\u2019s assets have \na legal maturity of 19 years, requiring long-tenor debt. IIFLHF is able to obtain longer-tenor debt \n(7\u201310 years) from the NHB. However, this comprises only 15% of its borrowings. Loans from \nbanks, the largest funding source (39% of borrowings), have a tenor ranging from 3 to 5 years, \nwhich results in asset and liability mismatches. HFCs must also diversify funding to maintain \nadequate liquidity, particularly given the tight liquidity conditions in the NBFC market. The long-\nterm local currency transaction will support the management of IIFLHF\u2019s asset liability profile. \n \nD.  CONFINDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impacts, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n28.  Impacts. The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) access to housing finance \nfor women lower-income borrowers increased and (ii) supply of climate-resilient green affordable \nhousing for EWS and LIG categories in India increased (footnote 2). \n \n29.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: availability of housing increased \nfor the EWS and LIG categories and for women borrowers, a portion of which will be climate-\nresilient and green-certified housing.33 \n \n30.  Outputs. The project\u2019s outputs will be (i) supply of climate-resilient and gender-responsive \ngreen affordable housing units for the EWS and LIG increased (ii) financial capacity to service \nEWS, LIG and women borrowers in accessing green housing units enhanced, (iii) access to \nclimate-resilient gender-responsive green-certified housing units for the EWS and LIG categories \nincreased, (iv) climate adaptation and increase in green-certified construction for housing in the \nEWS and LIG improved and (v) gender equality in IIFLHF\u2019s work environment improved. \n   \n \n32 ADB. 2020.

The project contributes to the following operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) \naddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironment sustainability; and (iv) making cities more livable.34 According to ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022, ADB\u2019s private sector operations will continue to support \nthe finance sector.35 The project also aligns with ADB\u2019s Climate Change Operational Framework, \n2017\u20132030, and with lessons learned from ADB\u2019s prior project experience in the affordable HFC \nsegment in India.36  \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n32.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category FI), involuntary resettlement (category FI \ntreated as C), and indigenous peoples (category FI treated as C). \n \n33.  ADB has assessed the loan\u2019s potential environmental and social (E&S) impacts, the risks \nassociated with the borrower\u2019s existing and/or likely future portfolio, and its commitment and \ncapacity for E&S management. During due diligence, ADB has identified the following actions to \nenhance IIFLHF\u2019s existing environmental and social management system (ESMS): (i) improve \nthe E&S screening and evaluation processes, (ii) implement E&S monitoring and reporting to \nADB, and (iii) prepare and implement an E&S training plan. IIFLHF will (i) apply ADB's prohibited \ninvestment  activities  list, (ii)  ensure that  investments  using  ADB  funds  comply  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement and abide by applicable national laws and regulations, and (iii) \nimplement and maintain an appropriate ESMS satisfactory to ADB before disbursement.37 The \nESMS will set out requirements, as applicable, for compliance with national labor laws with the \ninternationally recognized core labor standards, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.38 \nThe  ESMS  will  also  contain  requirements,  as  applicable,  for  information  disclosure  and \nconsultation with affected people in accordance with ADB requirements. IIFLHF will exclude \nactivities with category A environmental impacts and categories A and B involuntary resettlement \nand indigenous peoples impacts. It is therefore considered that IIFLHF\u2019s business activities have \nminimal site-specific environmental impacts. Housing projects siting and design shall take into \nconsideration impacts from climate change such as severe weather and flooding. No involuntary \nland  acquisition,  physical,  or  economic  displacement,  or  impact  on  indigenous  peoples\u2019 \ncommunities are expected. Borrowers, including developers or those in construction finance, will \npurchase land via commercial land transactions. IIFLHF screens loans against environmental \nrisks, resettlement, presence of easement, and involvement of properties in places that may \ndisrupt or displace indigenous peoples. \n \n \n34 ADB. 2018.

Gender equity theme. The project is classified as gender equity theme. Recognizing the \nrelevance of women\u2019s participation in IIFLHF\u2019s portfolio and within the company, IIFLHF commits \nto implementing measures to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in its business \nactivities following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998). Key features of the GAP \nplan are (i) increase of loan portfolio to low-income women borrowers and the number of gender-\nresponsive green affordable housing units; (ii) increase of mortgage and of green-certified loans \nfor women borrowers; (iii) ensure equal participation of women in the trainings to suppliers and \nbuilders on gender mainstreaming in green infrastructure development, and in the training to \nborrowers on the use of improved gender-responsive urban services; (iv) develop  strategies \nfocusing on attracting and hiring women; and (v) establish branches with a majority of women  \nstaff. IIFLHF will submit periodic reports on the progress of its GAP to ADB.39 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n36.  IIFLHF was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.
