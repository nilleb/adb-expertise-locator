INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Findings  from  a  recent  German  development  cooperation  through  Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) Human Resource Development for a \nMarket Economy Enterprise Survey highlighted the need for strengthening access to finance for \nmicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR).1  A series of consultative meetings with a wide range of stakeholders engaged in \nMSME  sector  development,  including  government  stakeholders;  civil  society;  MSMEs  in \nChampasak, Luang Prabang, and Vientiane provinces; and other key development partners \nconfirmed this need.2 Government and key development partners agreed that targeted efforts to \ndevelop specific subsectors could be used as a model for increasing access to finance in other \nsubsectors where MSMEs are actively engaged.3 Potential subsectors for consideration include \ntea, silk, and smallholder farming due to their linkages with ongoing interventions by the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),4 government  priorities,5 and  the  high  concentration  of  women \nentrepreneurs and cultural importance to the country (tea and silk).6  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  A landlocked, mountainous country in the heart of Southeast Asia, the Lao PDR has a \npopulation of 6.66 million people, 26% of whom live below the national poverty line.7 In 1986, \nthe  Government  of  the  Lao  PDR  began  decentralizing  control  and  encouraging  private \nenterprise development. Since then, MSMEs have played an increasingly important role in the \ndevelopment of the local economy. Of all registered enterprises in the Lao PDR, 99% are \nMSMEs, which are widely considered to be the backbone of the Lao economy. According to the \nGIZ Human Resource Development for a Market Economy Enterprise Survey 2013, from 2005 \nto 2013, MSMEs\u2019 \u201c\u2018lack of capital\u2019 has consistently been the most frequently cited \u2018big\u2019 or \u2018very \nbig\u2019 constraint\u2019\u201d due to complex application procedures, high collateral requirements, and high \nlending rates (footnote 1).8 More than 60.0% of enterprises require external financing in order to \nexpand their businesses and to increase output and turnover. However, the smallest proportions \nof those who utilize external financing are that of micro (26.6%) and small (42.0%) enterprises \ncompared to medium (60.7%) and large firms (72.7%). Micro firms had the largest percentage \nof respondents (23.7%) who do not have a bank account at all. It is clear that the smaller the \nenterprise, the more difficult it is to access finance. The majority of MSMEs rely on internal \nfinancing, as they are unable to access to the formal credit market in the country. \n \n3.  On the supply side, major constraints for micro and small entrepreneurs include lack of \ninformation on credit providers and products and the lack of collateral to secure bank loans. The \n                                                \n1   GIZ. 2014. Human Resource Development for a Market Economy Enterprise Survey 2013 for Lao PDR.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan for Additional \nFinancing to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Smallholder Development Project. Manila. \n5  Indigenous food crop sector will also be included in the potential subsector. \n6  ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loan \nand Technical Assistance Loan to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Second Private Sector and Small \nand Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program (Subprogram 2). Manila. The TA loan of the Second \nPSSMEDP has five outputs: (i) enterprise registry enhanced; (ii) regulatory impact assessments institutionalized; \n(iii) geographical indication system established (tea and silk to be considered); (iv) SME e-commerce and export \ndevelopment project established; and (v) project management unit established.  \n7  ADB. 2014. Basic Statistics 2014. Manila. \n8  In the GIZ Enterprise Survey, microenterprises are defined as comprising 0\u20132 employees, small enterprises 3\u201319 \nemployees, and medium-sized enterprises 20\u201399 employees. The average commercial lending rate in the Lao \nPDR is 23.2%. \n ", "2   \nsurvey states that, \u201cit is likely that strict borrowing regulations and high collateral requirements \nhave prompted entrepreneurs to borrow from family members instead\u201d (footnote 1). On the \ndemand side, enterprises who have indicated lack of capital as a constraint are characterized by \nlack  of  capacity  including  during  difficulties  faced  at  the  very  inception  of  setting  up  and \nregistering the enterprise and for some, not even having an investment and financial plan for the \nbusiness.9      \n   \n4.  Since 2007, ADB has been supporting the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) \nsector  through  the  Private  Sector  and  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises  Development \nProgram (PSME) and the Second Private Sector and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises \nDevelopment Program (PSME2).10 Under PSME, the government implemented measures to \nstrengthen the macroeconomic policy framework and to improve (i) SME policy development \nand coordination across agencies, (ii) the investment climate, and (iii) trade policy and capacity \ndevelopment. The PSME2 approved in October 2011 was built on the achievements of the \nPSME, including implementation of SME policy and access to services (including finance) and \npromotion of regulatory efficiency.11 ADB\u2019s involvement in improving access to finance was \nthrough policy dialogue with the credit information bureau and with Ministry of Justice in the \ndrafting of the secured transaction decree and its implementing regulations. In addition, with \nbudget support from the loan, the government set up the $2 million SME Promotion Fund \n(SMEPF) through its internal budget process approved by the National Assembly. To date, all \nthe  funds  have  been  disbursed.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  has  indicated  that  prior  to  any \nrecapitalization of the fund, there needs to be an impact assessment on fund performance and \nmanagement of the fund. Through the technical assistance (TA), ADB has an opportunity to \nsupport this assessment of the fund and help strengthen its outreach. Both the SMEPF and a \nproposed technology fund could be used to support the subsector selected as part of this TA. \nThe technology fund would be directly linked to the SMEPF and would allow qualified MSMEs in \nthe target subsector to apply for a grant for equipment needed to improve their business \nprocesses. This will enable ADB to directly support MSMEs to overcome the constraint on \naccess to finance. \n \n5.  In line with the country partnership strategy12 objective of promoting a stronger private \nsector enabling environment, this TA aims to complement and support ongoing activities in the \nMSME  sector  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners. 13  The  TA  will  also  take  up \nrecommendations  to  strengthen  access  to  finance  through  demand-  and  supply-side \ninterventions. Activities under the TA will help MSMEs overcome barriers to accessing finance \nthrough (i) traditional channels (e.g., business development services), (ii) the innovative use of \nseed capital (e.g., the SMEPF and technology fund), and (iii) leveraging new opportunities (e.g., \n                                                \n9  Annex 2, Analysis of Internal and External Problems (ES2013), GIZ Enterprise Survey.  \n10  ADB. 2007.

The country \npartnership strategy defines ADB's strategic approach in the Lao People's Democratic Republic for 2012\u20132016, \naligned with Strategy 2020 (ADB. 2008.

Manila),  the  country's  own  development  strategy,  and  ADB's  comparative \nstrengths, and complement efforts by its development partners. \n13 In June 2014, the World Bank approved a $20 million operation grant and credit to the Department of Small and \nMedium Enterprise Promotion to support access to finance for SMEs. A $3 million revolving loan fund for the SME \nsector is being provided by German development cooperation through KfW. \n ", "  3 \nthe secured transaction registry)14 in the design and utilization of a wider range of financial \nproducts that can better meet the needs of MSMEs at a reasonable level of risk. These TA \nactivities,  along  with  an  active  policy  dialogue  regarding  MSME  sector  coordination  and \nstrategic planning, can contribute to a possible future MSME development program or broader \naccess to finance initiative. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n6.  The TA will focus on both the demand for and the supply of financial services. The TA \nwill (i) help grow businesses through skills development to improve their ability to access \nexternal finance; and (ii) help financial service providers offer better and more suitable products \nand services, capitalizing on the newly launched secured transaction registry.  An additional \nfocus of this TA will be addressing the particular constraints for women entrepreneurs, who \noften have relatively little education or business skills, and are less likely to take out a loan due \nto less favorable borrowing terms. The executing agency and the implementing agency support \nthe impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing, and outline terms \nof reference. Closely linked to the TA loan of the PSME2, this TA will help bridge the end of the \nADB Rural Financial Sector Program and the PSME2. The TA continues ADB MSME sector \nengagement to create a facilitating environment  and a forward-looking approach that links \nMSME strengthening with better access to finance and overall private sector development. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact will be higher income of MSMEs in the targeted subsector as determined by \nbaseline assessment and regular monitoring and evaluation. The outcome of the TA will be \nincreased quality lending to MSMEs in targeted subsector, which will be measured by at least \n75% approval of loan applications made by MSMEs in target subsector.15 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  To  strengthen  access  to  finance  through  supply-  and  demand-side  interventions,  a \nseries of activities will be carried out as follows: \n \n(i)  Output  1:  Strengthened  capacity  of  micro,  small,  and  medium-sized \nenterprises to access finance. This output comprises two components: \n \n(a)  Component  1  involves  a  needs  assessment  of  MSMEs  in  selected \nsubsectors (e.g., silk, tea, smallholder farming), with a focus on the need \nand ability of these MSMEs to access formal financial services. While the \nGIZ  Enterprise  Survey  (footnote  1)  identifies  constraints  for  MSMEs \nthroughout the country, there may be additional constraints particular to \neach  subsector.  A  project  steering  committee,  established  by  the \nconsultant team, will contribute to developing the needs assessment. The \nassessment  will  include  an  analysis  of  differentiated  needs  and \nconstraints of MSMEs owned by men and women, and the assessment \nreport will contain recommendations that specify additional measures to \nbe provided for MSMEs owned by women to account for constraints that \n                                                \n14 The secured transaction registry will enable MSMEs to obtain loans using moveable assets. Banks can lodge \nsecurities over moveable assets of the MSMEs and submit them to the registry, which protects the creditors\u2019 rights. \nThis should stimulate SME lending and help overcome the problem of not having fixed collateral to obtain loans  \n15 Special focus will be made to include MSMEs which have failed to have a loan approved. \n ", "4   \ndo not necessarily affect male-owned MSMEs (e.g., cultural restrictions, \nhigh demands on time, and lower self-esteem). Within each subsector, \npilot production group organizations that can benefit most from targeted \nsupport and are interested in participating will be identified. Interviews will \nalso  be  conducted  with  financial  service  providers  operating  in  the \nselected subsector regions to assess their current MSME portfolios and \nconstraints, or their interest in lending to the targeted businesses. 16 \n(b)  Component 2 is capacity development of MSMEs to develop practices \nnecessary  to  improve  access  to  formal  financial  services.  Working \nthrough the branches and local government offices of the Lao National \nChamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  this  output  will  provide  tailored \nbusiness development services to MSMEs (at least half  of which are \nowned by women), including management skills development, business \nplanning,  financial  education,  and  increased  awareness  of  available \nfinancial services and how to access them. \n \n(ii)  Output  2:  Improved  financial  services  available  to  micro,  small,  and \nmedium-sized enterprises. This output comprises three components: \n \n(a)  Component 1 involves advising financial service providers on suitable \nproducts  and  services  for  MSMEs.  An  international  MSME  financial \nservices product design advisor will collaborate with a local counterpart to \nwork  with  interested  financial  service  providers  to  develop  a  broader \nrange of products and services that can meet the existing and growing \nneeds  of  MSMEs  in  the  target  subsector,  capitalizing  on  the  newly \nlaunched secured transaction registry. This will include collaborating with \nInternational  Finance  Corporation  for  wider  roll  out  of  the  secured \ntransaction registry. \n(b)  Component 2 involves conducting an impact assessment and promoting \nsound financial management of the SMEPF. This output will assess how \nthe SMEPF is being utilized; evaluate the impact to date; and identify \nways to build capacity of the fund to increase utilization, particularly by \nwomen-owned enterprises. \n(c)  Component 3 supports the establishment of a pilot technology fund to \nhelp MSMEs. Based on a similar matching grant fund included under \nSME sector development project in Cambodia, this pilot fund would be \ndirectly linked to the SMEPF and would allow qualified MSMEs in the \ntarget subsector to apply for a grant for equipment needed to improve \ntheir business processes.17 A framework and a set of criteria for the fund \nwill be developed that ensures transparency and effective monitoring and \nevaluation  of  the  usage  of  the  funds.  Criteria  will  be  included  to \nspecifically promote participation by women-owned enterprises. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.56 million, of which $1.50 million will be financed on a \n                                                \n16 For example, under the smallholder development project financed by ADB in the Lao PDR, farmer production \ngroups have strong negotiation power and their capacity is improved in managing the groups including finance and \naccounting, production plan, marketing, and accessing to finance. \n17 ADB. 2008.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  The  executing  agency  will  be  the  Department  of  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise \nPromotion, which has worked with ADB on SME sector development activities in the Lao PDR \nsince 2006. It will be the main point of contact for TA activities and will lead the project steering \ncommittee.  The  Lao  National  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  which  will  be  the \nimplementing  agency,  and  its  provincial  branches  will  serve  as  a  hub  for  the  business \ndevelopment services offered to MSMEs in the selected subsectors. The TA will be monitored \nthrough regular TA review missions as well as regular reporting by consultants on the progress \nof the capacity development support provided. An international and national monitoring and \nevaluation specialist will be engaged to assist in monitoring the program, gathering key lessons, \nmonitoring effective implementation, and replicating the approach for possible future use. TA \nproceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n11.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  as  individuals  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The TA will require \na total of 66 person-months for international and national consultants. ADB will recruit the \nfollowing  experts:  business  development  advisors,  SME  financial  services  product  design \nadvisors, monitoring and evaluation specialists, and a gender specialist.  \n \n12.  Any procurement under the TA for equipment will be in line with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and will be turned over to the executing \nagency upon completion of TA activities. The TA is expected to commence on 1 January 2015 \nand end on 31 December 2016. \n \n13.  Findings from the TA will be shared among key government agencies and key donor \norganizations active in MSME sector development. Good practices and case studies can be \ndisseminated through the ADB website and also through the SME Finance Forum.19 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,500,000  to  the \nGovernment of the Lao People's Democratic Republic to be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Strengthening Access to Finance for Micro, Small, and \nMedium-Sized Enterprises, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n18 Funding from the Government of Japan was approved on 28 October 2014. \n19 Managed by the International Finance Corporation, the SME Finance Forum brings together financial institutions, \ntechnology companies, and development finance institutions to share knowledge, spur innovation, and promote the \ngrowth of SMEs. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By end of 2018:     Assumption \nHigher income  of  Average income of  Subsector needs  Removing identified \nMSMEs in the  MSMEs in target subsector  assessment report  barriers to accessing \ntargeted subsector  increased (2015 baseline    finance will increase \nand percentage increase:  ADB review mission   utilization \nto be determined during     \nneeds assessment)   Monitoring and  Risk \n  evaluation reports  MSMEs in selected \nIncrease in the number of    subsectors affected by \nemployees employed by    other risk factors not \nMSMEs (2015 baseline    related to access to \nand appropriate increase:  finance \nto be determined during \nneeds assessment)  \nOutcome      Assumption \nIncreased quality  By end of 2016:  SME products and  MSMEs actively make \nlending to MSMEs in  At least 75% of loan  services advisor TA  use of assistance \ntargeted subsector  applications made by  report (determined  provided \nMSMEs in target subsector  through interviews with   \napproved (baseline to be  financial service  Risk \ndetermined during needs  providers)  MSMEs unable to \nassessment)    implement capacity \n  ADB review mission   development sufficiently \n50% of approved   \napplications are for  Monitoring and \nwomen-owned businesses  evaluation reports \nOutputs      Assumption  \n1.
