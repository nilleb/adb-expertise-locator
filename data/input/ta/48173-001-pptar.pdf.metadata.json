The  Government  has  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  a  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  prepare  the  Metro  Manila  Water  and  Sanitation \nDevelopment Project (formerly Metro Manila Wastewater Improvement Project which itself was \nformerly Metro Manila Sanitation Improvement Project), which is suitable for ADB financing. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The TA will (i) prioritize and identify infrastructure components for the ensuing loan project; (ii) \ndetermine the feasibility of such investments; and (iii) support the Metropolitan Waterworks and \nSewerage System (MWSS) through a comprehensive review of  its capacity for (a) regulatory \noversight (including a review of: the regulatory framework to strengthen it to ensure adequate \nconsumer  protection,  strong  utility  performance,  and  incentives  for  current  and  future \nconcessionaires to improve efficiency; the possible decoupling of the regulatory office; and the \nlearnings  from  various  rate-rebasing  exercises);  (b)  financial  management  and  planning \n(including understanding how funding sources impact tariffs, MWSS\u2019 projected debt service \ncapacity, and available financing options, e.g. cofinancing with multilateral/bilateral donors and \nother innovative structures); and (c) asset and water security management to assess and \naddress potential impacts due to climate change and natural disasters (especially earthquakes). \nThe TA will also relatively quickly evaluate the suitability of a multitranche financing facility (MFF) \nfor  MWSS\u2019  financing  requirements,  and  once  the  government  requests  for  an  MFF,  will \nundertake the due diligence needed for an MFF, and prepare the project administration manual \n(PAM) that includes all the information and schedules describing project implementation.  \n \n3.
