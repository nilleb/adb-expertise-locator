INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2014 country programming mission, the Government of Mongolia requested \ncapacity development technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nimplement a rapid assessment study, build capacity, and identify national priority actions for \npeatlands management in Mongolia.1 The TA has been included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan, 2014\u20132016.2 In June 2014, an ADB mission visited Mongolia and reached an \nunderstanding with the Ministry of Environment and Green Development (MEGD) and other \nstakeholders on the TA project\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, cost estimates and financing plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Peatlands  provide  many  important  ecosystem  services,  including  water  regulation, \nbiodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration and storage; and maintain productive pasture \nland for livestock grazing.3  Peatlands and organic soils contain 30% of the world\u2019s soil carbon \nbut only cover 3% of the earth\u2019s land area. To date, 15% of global peatlands are estimated to \nhave been drained and converted to other uses, including for agricultural development, peat \nmining, and forestry, especially for bioenergy plantations. Including emissions from peat fires, \nthese drained peatlands emit almost 6% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions \n2\nglobally. This represents almost 25% of emissions from the entire land use, land use change, \nand forestry sector.    \n \n3.  In Mongolia, peatlands constitute the last wet habitats in a major part of the country. The \npeatlands maintain wet habitats and pastures, feed rivers, prevent soil erosion, maintain levels \nof groundwater necessary for forest and crop growth, and keep wells full of water. During dry \nperiods, which may continue for years, the moisture preserved in peatlands is a source of life \nand a barrier to desertification.4 \n \n4.  Preliminary research findings indicate that almost 27,000 square kilometers (or almost 2% \nof Mongolia) are covered by peat. Peatlands are mainly used for grazing and sometimes as \narable land, and belong to the most productive pasture areas in the country. Private cattle \nhusbandry and the consequent overgrazing since the late 1990s are threatening peatlands. For \nexample, overgrazing and human-induced fires, combined with recent climate change, have led \nto the loss of thousands of hectares of peatlands in the Orkhon and Ider valleys and the Darkhat \nintermontane basin. The hydrological and climate mitigation functions of these critical peatlands \nin Mongolia are being compromised for two reasons: (i) the expansion of pastures in peatland \nareas,  which  has  been  a  consequence  of  long-term  drought;  and  (ii)  the  development  of \nextractive industries (gold, wolfram, and molybdenum). \n \n5.  Information regarding the distribution, natural functions, threats, and status of peatlands \nin Mongolia is insufficient and poor. This contributes to the lack of attention to peatlands in \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 October 2014.  \n2  ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n3  Peatlands are wetlands with a thick water-logged organic soil layer (peat) made up of dead and decaying plant \nmaterial.  Peatlands  include  moors,  bogs,  mires,  peat  swamp  forests,  and  permafrost  tundra  (Wetlands \nInternational. http://www.wetlands.org). In Mongolia, peatlands are one of the most productive pasture areas \n(International Mire Conservation Group. http://www.imcg.net). \n4   Minayeva et al. 2005. Mongolian Mires: From Taiga to Desert. Stapfia 85. Catalog of Upper Austria National \nMuseum. New Series 35. 335-352. http://www.landesmuseum.at/pdf_frei_remote/STAPFIA_0085_0335-0352.pdf. \n ", "2   \nnational development plans. Consequences of peatland degradation in Mongolia are not only \nloss of biodiversity and carbon stores, but also the loss of important and sometimes the last \nsource of water in the middle range mountains. These peatlands protect permafrost lenses, \nwhich fulfill the role of glacial water reserves in high mountains. Highland peatlands accumulate \na lot of precipitation, serving as water storage basins. This hydrological role of peatlands has \nnot been addressed in land use planning to date in Mongolia. Recognizing the urgent need to \naddress  this  issue  and  build  capacity  for  peatland  management  in  a  systematic  way,  the \ngovernment requested this TA.  \n \n6.  In 2006, Mongolia\u2019s total net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were reported as only \n15.6 million tons of CO  equivalent.5 The report stated that the fastest growth in emissions in the \n2\nfuture will be from the energy sector at 12.0% per annum over 2006\u20132030, as opposed to 0.2% \nfor the agriculture sector. In 2008, estimated emissions of up to 45 million tons per annum put \nMongolia as the seventh largest global emitter of CO  from degrading peatlands.6 These figures \n2\nshow that the enormous amount of emissions from degrading peatlands in Mongolia has not yet \nbeen fully estimated and reported. In addition, the policy framework in place is inadequate to \nprevent further deterioration and facilitate restoration. An up-to-date overview of the distribution \nand status of peatlands in Mongolia is urgently needed to improve estimation of GHG emissions \nand formulate priority actions. \n \n7.  From a global perspective, better insight into peatlands emissions is necessary because \nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has started discussions on the \nposition of land use in post-2020 GHG accounting, within the new global climate treaty. Better \ndata on the distribution and status of peatlands are necessary for this. Countries are also being \nurged to consider the inclusion of peatlands in their nationally appropriate mitigation actions.   \n \n8.  In  2003,  Mongolia  participated  in  the  Global  Peatland  Initiative  financed  by  the \nNetherlands. In 2007, an additional expedition to cover the eastern part of Mongolia (Onon river \nbasin) took place and included field surveys and paleoecological studies. Preliminary work on \nthe distribution of peatlands in Mongolia was conducted during these scientific surveys, but \nalmost no other work has been done on peatlands in Mongolia. This TA builds on this work in \nMongolia and current global and national initiatives in peatland management, restoration, and \nsustainable use.  \n \n9.  The TA supports the interim country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132016 for Mongolia as \npart of the core sector on agriculture, natural resources, and rural development.7 To prevent \nnatural resource degradation and environmental pollution, the interim strategy indicates that \nADB will support sustainable management of natural resources (i.e., water, land, forests, and \npeatlands); water security and information management; and protected area management. The \nTA directly responds to  the priorities identified in the National Action Program on Climate \nChange  (ratified  by  Parliament  in  2010)  in  Mongolia.  It  responds  to  the  action  program\u2019s \nstrategic objective 1, on supporting the establishment of the institutional framework on climate \nchange;  strategic  objective  2,  on  strengthening  national  adaptation  capacity;  strategic \nobjective 4, on capacity building related to climate change monitoring; and strategic objective 5, \non  community  participation  and  livelihood  support  in relation to  climate  change.  Measures \noutlined in the action program that this TA will support include the need to (i) develop action \n                                                \n5   Government  of  Mongolia,  Ministry  of  Nature,  Environment  and  Tourism.  2010.

The \nproposed TA also supports Mongolia\u2019s commitments to the Convention on Biological Diversity \nand the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be improved management of peatlands in Mongolia. It is expected that \nby 2020, MEGD will achieve its targets for improved management of peatlands and associated \nwater resources as set out in the approved strategic plan, in accordance with the prescribed \ntimelines.  \n \n11.  The outcome will be increased capacity of key stakeholders and an improved planning \nand implementation framework for peatland restoration and management in Mongolia. The TA \nwill  contribute  to  improved  environmental  management  and  sustainable  development  in \nMongolia by supporting the government\u2019s efforts in developing a strategic plan for peatland \nrestoration  and  management.  Through  capacity  building  and  development  of  priorities  for \npeatland management and restoration, the TA will address climate change, ecosystem, and \nwater management issues; and develop opportunities for improved livelihoods for communities \ndependent or associated with peatlands. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA aims to achieve the outcome through the following outputs and associated \nactivities.   \n \n13.  Output 1: A review and assessment of the distribution and status of peatlands in \nMongolia. This output will provide a better understanding of the distribution, status, diversity, \nfunctional characteristics, uses, and threats to peatlands based on literature reviews and gap-\nfilling activities. The assessment will include a brief analysis of the social, economic, legal, and \ninstitutional  aspects  related to  peatland  management  in  Mongolia.  Activities  will  include  (i) \nliterature review  and field  surveys,  including  preparation  and  analysis of  additional  remote \nsensing  information;  (ii)  stakeholder  and  expert  group  meetings  and  capacity  building  on \npeatlands during information gathering; (iii) gap analysis and risk analysis for peatlands, and the \necosystem services it provides; (iv) estimation of emissions from peatlands; and (v) preparation \nof an assessment report on peatlands in Mongolia.8 The TA is discussing cooperation and input \nfrom the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency on additional remote sensing data to help with \nthe gap-filling exercise. \n \n14.  Output 2: Enhanced awareness and capacity of key stakeholders at the national \nand  local  levels  in  relation  to  sustainable  management  of  peatlands. This output will \nemphasize the development and initial implementation of a communication and stakeholder \nengagement strategy to build the awareness and capacity of key stakeholders regarding the \n                                                \n8  In addition to new sites, for comparison purposes, it is proposed that the field survey sites include the sites where \npast preliminary peatland surveys were conducted. These include those sites located in Hovsgol, Arkhangai, \nKhentil and Selenge aimags.  \n ", "4   \nrole of peatlands in the ecosystem, and linkages to climate change and livelihoods. Activities will \ninclude (i) preparation of information material on peatlands in Mongolia, in the most appropriate \nformat; (ii) capacity building and awareness programs targeting key sectors and communities in \nrelation to peatland management and sustainable use; and (iii) preparation of a knowledge \nproduct (policy brief) on peatland management in Mongolia. Capacity building activities will be \nincorporated into the key consultation meetings and workshops planned under the TA.  \n \n15.  Output 3: A draft action plan with priorities for sustainable peatland management \nin  Mongolia  prepared.  The  action  plan  for  peatlands  will  include  recommendations  for \nmanagement  and  restoration  actions  needed,  and  the  financial  resource  requirements  for \nimplementation of these activities. The role of local communities and the private sector in \npeatland management and restoration (e.g., the mining industry) will also be explored, along \nwith  other  innovative  financing  mechanisms  for  peatland  management  and  restoration. \nRecommendations on the possible development of nationally appropriate mitigation actions \nassociated with peatlands will also be explored. Anticipated activities include (i) establishment of \na working group for development of the action plan; (ii) stakeholder consultation workshops; \n(iii) preparation of a draft action plan and priorities for peatland management in Mongolia, \nincluding recommendations for peatland-related mitigation actions; and (iv) recommendations \nfor  peatland  management  and  livelihood  improvement  activities  of  the  reindeer  herders  of \nnorthwestern Mongolia.9  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. Complementary \nassistance  will  be  provided  by  the  Knowledge  and  Innovation  Support  for  ADB\u2019s  Water \nFinancing  Program  through  the  engagement  of  one  international  expert  under  the  ADB-\nUNESCO-IHE  Institute  for  Water  Education  knowledge  partnership.10 The  government  will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff  time,  logistical  support,  office \nfacilities, cofinancing of workshops, and other in-kind contributions. The TA will be disbursed in \naccordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented from 1 January 2015 to 30 June 2016. MEGD will be the \nexecuting agency. A TA management office will be established in MEGD and will be responsible \nfor  day-to-day  operations  with  ADB,  consultants,  and  related  government  agencies.  The \nchairperson of the climate change coordination office at MEGD will be the executive director of \nthe TA management office. Advance payment facility will be set up within the TA management \noffice,  subject  to  the  capacity  of  MEGD  to  complete  the  activities  and  liquidate  advance \npayments according to ADB\u2019s procedures. The project officer of the climate change coordination \noffice  at  MEGD  will  serve  as  the  overall  manager  of  the  TA  and  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordination among ADB, consultants, and related government agencies.       \n \n                                                \n9  The Ministry of Environment and Green Development had also requested that the TA organize an international \nworkshop or conference on peatlands. This will be discussed during the inception phase, and options for financing \nthis international workshop will be explored during the TA inception phase.  \n10  ADB. 2008.

It is estimated that the TA will require 7 person-months of international and 15 person-\nmonths of national consulting services. Two international consultants (peatland management \nand restoration specialist and team leader, and remote sensing specialist) and four national \nconsultants  (ecosystem  management  and  peatland  specialist  and  deputy  team  leader, \ngeographic information system specialist, communications and capacity building specialist, and \nsocial development specialist) will be required for TA implementation. A consulting firm will be \nengaged by ADB following its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time) using the quality- and cost-based selection method, with a quality\u2013cost weighing \nratio  of  80:20.  The  simplified  technical  proposal  method  will  be  used.  Equipment  will  be \nprocured following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and \nwill be handed over to MEGD upon completion of the proposed TA. Operational expenses for \ntranslation, printing, and organizing of TA-related workshops will be included in the consultant\u2019s \ncontract. The draft outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. To support the \nfield surveys (including geographic information systems and mapping work), it is expected that \nMongolian technical institutes will be subcontracted by the main consulting firm during the \ninception phase of the TA.  \n \n19.  A  TA  steering  committee  will  be  established  to  provide  guidance  on  project \nimplementation  issues  and  to  ensure  intra-  and  inter-departmental  coordination.  The  vice \nminister for environment and green development will chair the committee, which will consist of \nmembers  from  relevant  sectors,  research  institutes,  and  civil  society  organizations.  It  is \nproposed that the following organizations and departments be represented on the TA steering \ncommittee\u2014MEGD (including the focal points of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the \nRamsar Convention on Wetlands, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange), the Division of Forest Conservation and Reforestation Management, MEGD, Ministry \nof  Industry  and  Agriculture,  National  Emergency  Management  Agency,  Institute  of  Botany, \nInstitute  of  Meteorology  and  Hydrology,  School  of  Power  Engineering  at  the  Mongolian \nUniversity of Science and Technology, Institute of Hydrology and Meteorology, and Mongolian \nEnvironmental Civil Council. A separate technical working group will provide technical input to \nthe draft peatland action plan developed by the consultants\u2019 team. The composition of the \ntechnical working group will be discussed at the TA inception workshop. MEGD will chair this \ntechnical working group.  \n \n20.  Inception, interim, and final review missions will be fielded; and tripartite meetings will be \nheld  during  the  missions  to  review  the  consultants\u2019  performance,  and  TA  implementation \nprogress and deliverables, based on the design and monitoring framework and the consultants\u2019 \nwork  plan.  The  missions  will  also  monitor  the  government\u2019s  inputs  and  contributions  as \ndocumented  in  the  final  TA  report.  The  performance  of  the  TA,  including  its  outputs  and \noutcomes, will be evaluated during the final review mission based on the design and monitoring \nframework. Good practices and lessons will be disseminated through workshops, conferences, \nand publications.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n21.
