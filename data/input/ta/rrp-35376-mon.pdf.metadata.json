The Governance Reform \nProgram (GRP)1 led to the formulation of a 10-year reform roadmap to \nbe implemented over 1999\u20132009. GRP also helped implement critical \nadministrative and financial management reforms on a pilot basis in \nselected  budgetary  agencies  over  1999-2002.  A  milestone \nachievement  of  GRP  was  the  adoption  of  the  Public  Sector \nManagement and Finance Law (PSMFL), which provides a sound legal \nframework  to  guide  budget,  output,  performance,  and  financial \nmanagement reforms. \n \nWhile its processes have been strengthened through GRP, the public \nsector continues to face significant challenges and constraints. It is \nlarge  and  inefficient,  and  significantly  risks  fiscal  instability  unless \nconcerted  reforms  as  provided  by  PSMFL  are  undertaken.  The \nGovernment\u2019s forward-looking approach, formulated with support from \nADB  and  other  funding  agencies,  aims  to  (i)  improve  public \nexpenditure management and enhance the quality of public services to \nreduce poverty; (ii) implement PSMFL systematically through learning \nby doing, given the capacity constraints; (iii) infuse sound financial \nmanagement  practices  to  enhance  fiscal  responsibility  at  all \ngovernment  levels;  (iv)  strengthen  the  civil  service;  (v)  address \nmedium-term issues of administrative  consolidation at the regional, \nprovincial (aimag), and district (soum) levels, to enhance economies of \nscale  and  achieve  efficiency  in  delivery  of  public  services;  and \n(vi) mainstream governance reforms in key institutions, including state-\nowned enterprises and the judiciary, among others. \n \nThe proposed program cluster forms an integral part of the governance \nreform roadmap and will help further the reforms through capacity \nbuilding as well as mainstreaming measures. \n   \nObjective and Scope  The goal of GRP-II is to enhance accountability and efficiency of the \npublic sector, to be measured by fiscal sustainability and tangible \nimprovements in delivery of key public services. The purpose of GRP-\nII, following the measures adopted under GRP on a pilot basis, is to \nsupport the gradual implementation of public sector administrative \n                                                 \n1 Loan 1713-MON: Governance Reform Program.  ", "iii \n \nand financial management reforms. GRP-II will adopt a three-pronged \napproach to the following:  \n \n(i)  Enhance institutional capacity. \n \n(a)  Support implementation of PSMFL-related measures \non strategic planning and output-based budgeting, with \nfocus  on  health,  education,  and  social  welfare  and \nlabor. \n(b)  Strengthen  the  institutional  and  implementation \narrangements for financial governance norms in the \npublic sector. \n  \n(ii)  Improve fiscal sustainability. \n(a)  Initiate pension reforms to alleviate fiscal pressures on \nthe budget stemming from the public pension system. \n(b)  Initiate administrative consolidation to reduce multiple \nlayers of control that impede efficiency and lead to \nwaste of scarce resources. \n \n(iii)       Mainstream governance reforms.  \n(a)  Enhance  the  enforcement  capacity  of  the  State \nService  Council  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  civil \nservice. \n(b)  Enhance confidence in key public institutions. \n   \nPoverty Classification  Other \n   \nThematic  Good governance, economic growth \nClassification \n   \nEnvironmental  Category  C.  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed,  and  no \nAssessment  significant adverse environmental impacts identified. \n   \nThe Program Loan   \n  Loan   Amount  GRP-II adopts a cluster approach comprising subprograms 1 and 2. A \n  and Terms  loan of SDR9.699 million (equivalent to $13.5 million) from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources will be provided for subprogram 1. The loan \nwill have a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and \nan interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per year for the remaining period. A loan of $10 million is \nenvisaged for subprogram 2, to be designed and proposed separately \nfor  ADB\u2019s  consideration  upon  satisfactory  implementation  of \nsubprogram 1. \n \nProgram  Subprogram 1 will be implemented from October 2003 to December \nPeriod and Tranching  2005,  while  the  program  framework  also  includes  a  number  of \nprogram measures have been implemented since September 2002, \nwhen GRP was completed. Subprogram 2 will be prepared after the \nmidterm review of subprogram 1. The loan for subprogram 2 will be \npresented  for  ADB\u2019s  consideration,  based  on  progress  in \n ", "iv   \npresented  for  ADB\u2019s  consideration,  based  on  progress  in \nimplementing in subprogram 1.  \n \nThe  resources  of  SDR9.699  million  under  subprogram  1  will  be \ndivided into two tranches: the first, for subprogram 1, for SDR3.592 \nmillion (equivalent to $5.000 million), will be released upon approval \nof  GRP-II  by  ADB  and  loan  effectivity.  Subject  to  satisfactory \nfulfillment of all the second-tranche release conditions in the policy \nmatrix and the other program conditions that can be monitored, the \nsecond tranche of SDR6.107 million (equivalent to $8.500 million) is \nexpected to be released by July 2005. \n   \n  Executing  The Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE) will be the executing \n  Agency  agency  for  GRP-II  and  responsible  for  implementing  all  PSMFL-\nrelated measures, public sector financial management reforms, and \nsocial  security  reforms.  The  Cabinet  Secretariat  (CS)  will  be  the \nimplementing agency for all the local government reform issues, civil \nservice  reforms,  and  the  anticorruption  component.  CS  will  also \nensure  Cabinet-level  coordination  to  implement  GRP-II efficiently. \nThe Government has established a GRP program implementation \nunit (PIU) under MOFE.  \n \nGiven the coverage of a number of cross-sectoral issues and the \ncomplexity  of  the  reforms,  the  Government  will  form  a  steering \ncommittee and an operational working group to advise and support \nMOFE and CS. The steering committee will be led by the chief of CS \nand comprise the minister of finance and economy, minister of social \nwelfare and labor, economic advisor to the prime minister, and two \nrepresentatives  from  the  Parliamentary  Working  Group  on \nGovernance. The operational working group will be led by the deputy \nminister of finance and economy, and comprise deputy chief of the \nCS in charge of local government reforms, the heads of fiscal policy \nand accounting departments of MOFE, and head of administration of \nthe National Audit Office (NAO). \n   \n  Procurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs \nof items produced and procured in ADB member countries (other than \nitems specified in the negative list and imports financed by other \nbilateral and multilateral agencies). The Government will certify that \nthe value of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB's projected \ndisbursements under the loan for the given period. ADB reserves the \nright to audit the use of the loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of \nthe Government's certification. \n   \n  Counterpart  The Program includes specific components that bear distinct costs of \n  Funds  structural adjustments. The counterpart funds to be generated out of \nthe loan proceeds will be used to finance the cost of such structural \nadjustments and high-priority development projects. \nThe Technical   \nAssistance Loan \n  Loan  The proposed TA loan for CBGR will help the Government enhance \n  Description  its  overall  capacity  to  implement  the  key  governance-related ", "v \n \n  Description  its  overall  capacity  to  implement  the  key  governance-related \nmeasures under GRP-II, including on-the-job training programs for \ngovernment accountants and auditors. The scope of CBGR will cover \nthe following: \n \n(i)  financial management reforms in public sector accounting, \nauditing, and asset valuation; \n(ii) support  for  strategic  planning  in  relation  to  PSMFL \nimplementation; and  \n(iii) software  and  limited  hardware  support  to  efficiently \nundertake financial statement and performance audits and \noutput costing. \n \n  Loan   Amount  A TA loan of SDR1.437 million ($2 million equivalent) for CBGR is \n  and Terms  proposed to be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with a \nterm of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years. The TA loan will \ncarry an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per year for the remaining period. \n   \n  Executing  MOFE  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA  loan.  The  PIU \n  Agency  established for GRP-II will also coordinate all the activities under \nCBGR. CS will support interministerial coordination. \n   \n  Procurement  The TA loan for CBGR will involve the use of 53 person-months of \ninternational consulting services, comprising the following: (i) advisor \nto the accountant general for 18 person-months; (ii) PSMFL strategic \nplanning advisor for 13 person-months; (iii) advisory services to the \nNAO  for  18  person-months  through  a  team  of  two  international \nauditors,  who  will  work  with  six  NAO  auditors  to  implement  the \nrelevant  GRP-II  conditions;  (iv)  an  asset  valuation  expert  for  2 \nperson-months; (v) a management information systems (MIS) expert \nto design a software package for audits and provide training for 2 \nperson-months.  About  120  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nsupport will also be procured in the above areas, including project \nmanagement.  All  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be \nrecruited  individually  in  accordance  with  quality-  and  cost-based \nprocedures, ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and other \narrangements satisfactory to the ADB for engagement of domestic \nconsultants. \n   \nRisks and Safeguards  Institutional reforms, particularly in the public sector, are subject to \nrisks. As GRP has set the overall  direction of reforms, GRP-II has \nfewer risks. However, subprograms 1 and 2 are likely to face four \nspecific types of risk, for which the program has sufficient safeguards:  \n \n(i) PSMFL implementation may falter due to capacity constraints. The \nGovernment has thus adopted a gradual, learning-by-doing approach. \nADB emphasizes that implementation should allow for mid-course \ncorrections. Ongoing TAs and the proposed TA loan for CBGR will \nprovide  significant  capacity-building  support  to  alleviate  capacity \nconstraints and to assuage the concerns of the civil servants. \n ", "vi   \nconstraints and to assuage the concerns of the civil servants. \n \n(ii) Pension reform anywhere is complex as it involves difficult policy \nchoices, including elimination of early retirement privileges, which \nmay affect laborers in certain industries. However, the Government \nrecognizes that the pension system will have serious problems unless \nits generous provisions are changed. Significant advisory support has \nbeen provided to analyze various options, guided by sound actuarial \nmodeling.  The  Government  has  drafted  guidelines  to  gradually \nreduce early retirement privileges. GRP-II will support wide public \nconsultations, education, and consensus building for reforms in this \narea. \n \n(iii) Administrative consolidation measures carry considerable risks. \nThe  Government  has  undertaken  preliminary  analysis  and \nstakeholder  consultations.  However,  the  degree  of  acceptance  or \nresistance  to  reform  can  be  gauged  only  when  the  Government \nfinalizes  its  concept  paper  and  engages  in  well-structured \nconsultations with the local citizens\u2019 representative assemblies. The \nGovernment  is  optimistic  that  the  much-needed  reforms  can  be \nfacilitated if consolidation measures are designed gradually with local \ninputs. \n \n(iv) Some political risks are associated with a program of this nature. \nIn particular, as Mongolia will hold parliamentary elections in mid-\n2004,  serious  reforms  may  not  be  carried  through.  Short-term \nconcerns  of  local  governments  with  regard  to  difficulties  in \nimplementing PSMFL, opposition to pension reforms, and resistance \nto administrative or structural changes may prevail over the need for \nreforms. Two factors could cushion reform against the political risk. \nFirst, the Government and Parliament have been fully committed to \npublic sector reforms. Despite a major change in the Government in \n2000,  reforms  were  implemented  smoothly.  Given  the  significant \npolitical capital and financial resources invested, it is also in the \nGovernment\u2019s and Parliament\u2019s best interest to ensure that PSMFL-\nrelated reforms are irreversible. Second, the cluster program modality \ngives the Government greater flexibility than otherwise possible by \nproviding the overall program framework and a longer implementation \nperiod. ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster concept for the Second Phase of the Governance Reform Program in Mongolia \n(GRP-II), (ii) proposed loan to Mongolia for subprogram 1 of GRP-II, and (iii) proposed technical \nassistance (TA) loan for capacity building for governance reforms (CBGR) to support the \nimplementation of subprogram 1. \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n \n2.  Unlike other transition economies in East and Central Asia, Mongolia managed its \ntransition well until the mid-1990s. Output decline in the early years of the transition was \nreversed in only 4 years, and real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 1% in 1994, and 6% in \n1995. Inflation declined significantly and fiscal deficit was brought down from 13% of GDP in \n1990 to 7% by 1995. However, the initial gains were not sustained due to various constraints, \nprimarily  lack  of  economic  diversification,  with  heavy  reliance  on  livestock  and  copper \nproduction. Central and local fiscal discipline was also lacking, which led to a build up of on- and \noff-budget expenditures. Economic performance thus deteriorated in the second half of the \n1990s, with GDP growth declining from 4% in 1997 to just over 1% in 2000 and 2001. The fiscal \ndeficit increased to 8% of GDP in 1996 and further to 14% of GDP in 1998.  \n \n3.  Fiscal profligacy in the mid-1990s was exacerbated by a variety of factors, including \n(i) weak budget management, reporting, and control frameworks, resulting in inadequate checks \nand balances; (ii) full devolution of expenditure responsibilities to lower tiers of government \nwithout  adequate  accountability;  (iii)  weak  revenue  administration;  (iv)  inadequate  treasury \ncontrols;  (v) weak  political  will  and  bureaucratic  commitment  to  maintaining  overall  fiscal \ndiscipline; and (vi) weak operational and financial practices adopted by budgetary bodies and \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs). \n \n4.  Against this background, in 1998 the Government sought ADB\u2019s support through the \nGovernance Reform Program (GRP)2 to strengthen public sector administration and financial \nmanagement. As part of GRP, a 10-year governance reform roadmap was formulated to guide \ngovernance reforms in 1999-2009, with initial implementation support provided on a pilot basis \nunder the program in 1999-2002. GRP aimed to facilitate the transition to a new structure by \nestablishing systems for sound public sector financial management and accountability and \ntransparent  data  and  for  information  dissemination.  GRP  thus  focused  on  (i)  improving \naggregate fiscal discipline, (ii) strengthening public sector budget formulation and execution, \n(iii) enhancing operational efficiency within the public sector, (iv) addressing the social impact \nand financing needs of sector reforms, and (v) preparing the groundwork for continuation of \nreforms. The enactment of the Public Sector Management Finance Law (PSMFL) in June 2002, \nafter extensive consultations in 1997-2002, was the most important milestone of GRP as a \nprogram-end condition. PSMFL3 has placed Mongolia ahead of the other countries that have \nintroduced new public sector management approaches but in the absence of a sound legal \nframework. \n \n5.  GRP introduced reforms in strategic planning, output specification, and performance \nmanagement, first in five major public service agencies (bunch-1 entities): General Department \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1999.

Manila. \n3  Supplementary Appendix 1 outlines PSMFL\u2019s basic features. ", "2 \n \nof National Taxation (GDNT), Customs General Administration (CGA), National Audit Office \n(NAO),4 State Service Council (SSC), and National Statistics Office (NSO). Based on a review \nof government progress in the bunch-1 agencies, GRP also phased in basic reform measures in \n11 ministries and agencies and two provinces5 with ADB TA support.6 As GRP was envisaged \nas a pilot program, the Government did not aim for any structural changes in central or local \npublic administration in the first phase.  \n \n6.  While  GRP  has  laid  a  sound  foundation  to  guide  public  sector  administration  and \nfinancial management reforms in Mongolia, a formidable reform agenda remains to be fulfilled. \nIn particular, effective implementation of PSMFL is highly critical to ensure that reforms do not \nfail. The public sector remains large and inefficient, and risks significant fiscal instability. While the \nconstitutional and political structure have conferred significant administrative autonomy to the \nlocal governments, most local governments, except for three provinces, have relied heavily on \ntransfers from the central Government for more than 60% of their revenue needs. However, \nPSMFL gives local governments the flexibility to make expenditure decisions. Effective from 1 \nJanuary 2003, PSMFL calls for fiscal responsibility, accountability, and transparency at all levels\u2014\noutcomes that require time and persistent reforms. \n \n7.  A 10-year reform roadmap has been adopted in recognition of the complexity of budget, \noutput, and performance management reforms. While the introduction of output and performance \nmanagement  reforms  was  relatively  easier  for  bunch-1  agencies  due  to  their  well-defined \nfunctions and outputs, reforms in line ministries and other budgetary agencies have yet to gain \nmomentum.  The  line  ministries  have  to  implement  PSMFL  in  their  agreements  with  local \ngovernments to deliver public services. The central Government should link policy priorities with \nmeasurable outputs. Line ministries should strengthen their planning, internal control, and \nmonitoring functions so that local authorities\u2019 outputs can be evaluated. Local authorities, in \nturn,  should  clearly  articulate  their  local  development  needs  and  ensure  that  they  are \nadequately reflected in national priorities through output agreements. \n \n8.  The proposed program cluster builds on GRP reforms and the lessons learned.7 PSMFL-\nrelated measures must be mainstreamed gradually at all levels of the public sector in appropriate \nsequence: (i) PSMFL has clarified the relative functions, roles, and responsibilities of governments \nat different levels; (ii) capacity constraints need to be addressed; (iii) the implementation process \nshould recognize such constraints and adopt a learning-by-doing approach; (iv) civil service \nreforms need to be launched; and (v) structural constraints, including multiple levels of public \nadministration,  need  to  be  removed  gradually.  The  program  cluster  aims  to  support  the \nGovernment through the second phase of reforms, building on lessons learned from the design \nand implementation of the initial phase of reforms under GRP.  \n \n                                                 \n4  NAO used to be the State Audit and Inspection Committee. \n5  These include Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE); Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor (MSWL); Ministry of \nJustice and Home Affairs; Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science (MOSTEC); Ministry of Health (MOH); \nMinistry  of  Environment;  State  Financial  Inspection  Department;  Environmental  Protection  Agency;  Land \nAdministrative Authority; State Meteorological Agency; and Clinical Hospital No.1. GRP also focused on two pilot \nprovinces, Arhangi and Selenge; and on Nalaikh District Administration, a jurisdiction within Ulaanbaatar City, to \npilot-test provincial and subprovincial administrative reforms. \n6  Appendix 1 presents information on TA support. Under TA 3316-MON: Initial Phase of Public Administration \nReforms, a team of domestic experts was trained by the international consultants in international best practices in \npublic sector resource management. Since then, the team has been implementing reforms.  \n7  Section IV, subsection B, outlines of lessons learned from GRP. The program completion report for GRP \n(December 2002) presents additional details. ", "3 \nIII.  RECENT MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS \n \n9.  In accordance with the GRP, and in line with the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility \n(PRGF) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the budgets for 1999 and 2000 aimed to \nreduce deficit levels. The budget deficit declined from 12.2% of GDP in 1999 to 6.8% in 2000 \nand 5.3% in 2001, which is impressive given the expenditure overruns due to the dzud (dry \nsummer followed by harsh winter) in those years. Improved collection of tax and non-tax \nrevenues and a 2.0% increase in value-added taxes and import taxes on energy inputs helped \nraise the revenue-GDP ratio from 27.2% in 1999 to 38.0% in 2001. The recovery in international \ngold prices also helped compensate for expenditure overruns. \n \n10.  Economic prospects improved in 2002 after 2 years of stagnation. Despite the continuing \nlow world prices for copper and cashmere, Mongolia\u2019s key exports, real GDP registered 3.9% \ngrowth in 2002. Inflation slowed considerably to 1.6% in 2002, against 8.0% in 2001. However, \nthe Government, in line with the promises made in 2000 to increase civil service wages and \npensions, announced a 20% rise in wages and pensions effective 1 October 2002, which \npushed current expenditure up by as much as 1% of GDP. The Government and IMF had \nestimated that this measure would increase the fiscal deficit to 7.0\u20138.0% significantly above the \n6.5% target under PRGF. With World Bank support, the Government then embarked on social \nsector privatization and civil service reforms. To stay within the established expenditure and \nrevenue targets, an extraordinary session of Parliament revised the budget in August 2002. \nThese efforts, combined with higher-than-expected revenue collection attributable to the sale of \nthe Trade and Development Bank, helped contain the fiscal deficit at 5.6% of GDP. The deficit is \nforecast at 6.1% for 2003, also below the PRGF target. \n \n11.  Since the early 1990s poverty reduction has been the single most complex challenge \nfacing Mongolia. The collapse of the command system led to a general deterioration in access \nto as well as quality of public services. The latest poverty figures are from the 1998 living \nstandards measurement survey. While income inequality widened over 1995-1998, poverty \nincidence changed marginally from 36.3% in 1995 to 35.6% in 1998. Urban poverty is more \nsevere, with poverty incidence measured at 39.4% in 1998. Environmental factors, including \nfrequent harsh winters, overgrazing of pastures, and weak natural resource management, have \nalso increased household vulnerability to economic shocks.  \n \n12.  IMF approved the ongoing 3-year PRGF in September 2001 for SDR29 million. The first \nannual review, scheduled for 2002, was not conclusive due to fiscal concerns with regard to the \nincrease in civil service wages. Following the budgetary amendments in August 2002, IMF and \nthe Government reached an understanding on the fiscal issues in December 2002. However, \nslippage in monetary targets coupled with the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) extending two loan \nguarantees to private sector entities has delayed the PRGF release. IMF has formulated a \nnumber of corrective measures that BOM is implementing: (i) a clear policy relinquishing any \nBOM loan guarantees to the private sector, (ii) completion of a special audit of BOM\u2019s net \ninternational reserves at the end of 2002, and (iii) amendments to the Law on the Central Bank \nto  improve  governance  in  BOM.  Subject  to  satisfactory  progress  on  these  fronts,  IMF  is \nexpected to release the pending tranches in the third quarter of 2003. \n \n \n ", "4 \n \nIV.  THE PUBLIC SECTOR8 \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n \n1.  Overall Public Sector\u2014Public Administration and Key Fiscal Pressures \n \n13.  Mongolia is one of the least densely populated countries in the world, with 2.45 million \npeople living across 1.6 million square kilometers. The country is divided into 21 provinces and \nthe Ulaanbaataar capital city administration. The 21 provinces are subdivided into 331 districts; \nUlaanbaataar is subdivided into 9 districts. The districts, in turn, are organized as 1,634 villages, \nwhich provide services at the lowest tiers of government. At the central level, 11 ministries, 17 \nregulatory agencies, and 30 implementing agencies formulate policy and administer central \nfunctions.9 Five agencies report directly to Parliament: NAO, SSC, NSO, BOM, and Securities \nand Exchange Commission. There are close to 6,000 budgetary bodies, including schools and \nhospitals. There are 110 SOEs, with 51% or more of state ownership, which also come under \nthe purview of PSMFL. \n \n14.  Measured by expenditure, the government sector is larger than in other comparable \ntransition economies. Consolidated government expenditure as a share of GDP has averaged \nat around 39% per year in 1993-2000.10 Current expenditures dominate, rising from 57% of total \ngovernment expenditures in early 1990s to around 70% in 2000. In particular, the public sector \nwage bill as a share of GDP, at 8.2% in 2000, is among the highest in region,11 amounting to \n20% of total expenditures. Tax administration reforms over the last few years have led to a \nsurge in overall government revenue from 25.6% of GDP in 1995 to 38.0% in 2001. However, \ntax rates are high: corporate and personal income tax rates can go up to 40%. As a result, tax \nrevenue as a share of GDP stands at 29%, much higher than in comparable Asian economies. \n \n15.  At the end of 2000 the public sector had 166,700 employees, of whom 135,400 were \nbudgeted positions in the state budgetary bodies, while actual employment was 116,400, \nindicating a vacancy rate of about 16%. Government service is political (including members of \nParliament, heads of governments at different levels, and heads and staff in foreign missions); \nadministrative; special (heads of courts, senior officers of the armed forces, and heads of \nagencies reporting to Parliament, etc.); and support (education, health, and other government-\naffiliated  organizations).  In  2001  political  service  accounted  for  1.9%  of  all  government \npositions; administrative service, 5.6%; special service, 21.3%; and support service, 71.2%.  \n \n16.  The public administration system faces a number of challenges. Simply stated, the \npublic sector is unviable. Constraints range from organizational problems resulting in lack of \ntransparency and poor accountability, to the terrain, which imposes unique constraints on public \nservice delivery. The lack of fiscal responsibility and budgetary discipline is mainly due to the \nlarge  public  sector.  There  is  one  public  sector  agency  for  every  350  people.  While  the \n                                                 \n8  More information on the sector and its key issues and challenges is in ADB. 2003. Governance: Progress and \nChallenges in Mongolia. (Draft). \n9 Of the 11 ministries, 3 (finance and economy, foreign affairs, and  justice and home affairs) perform central \nmanagement functions. The rest are line ministries: MOSTEC, MOH, MSWL, environment, defense, infrastructure, \ntrade and industry, and food and agriculture. \n10 Uzbekistan has had a higher share over the same period, while Kazakhstan, Bulgaria, Latvia, and Romania, \namong others, have had lower shares. \n11 For instance, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan have had ratios of less than 5%, and the average for a \nset of comparable transition economies stood at just over 6%. ", "5 \nGovernment adopted various decentralization measures in 1995 to improve public service \ndelivery,  the  public  sector\u2019s  size  has  curtailed  the  benefits  of  decentralization, given the \nmultiplicity of agencies performing similar tasks. Besides administrative weaknesses, lack of \ntechnical skills has been a recurring concern. With regard to the new budget and output-based \nmanagement reforms, a key weakness is the lack of understanding and ability to define and \ncost outputs, and to link sector policies with specific measurable outputs and outcomes that can \nbe monitored. This may be a key constraint impeding the formulation of sectoral budgetary \nappropriations on output basis, which is a requirement under PSMFL. \n \n17.  Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations. Fiscal relations between the central and local \ngovernments have gone through significant changes over the last decade. In 1990 the share of \nlocal expenditures to general government expenditures stood at 49.4%, before declining to \n24.4% in 1994. In the mid-1990s the central Government allowed local governments to exercise \nincreasing responsibilities to focus on attaining overall macroeconomic stability. As a result, the \nshare of local in general government expenditures increased to 35.8% in 1995, but later \ndeclined to 29.3% in 2001. Over the same period, the share of local government revenue to \ngeneral government revenue has also declined, from 43.5% in 1990 to 18.4% in 2001. In \nnominal terms, local public sector wage and salary costs increased 10-fold from MNT6.5 million \nin 1993 to MNT66.0 million in 2000, while expenditures on goods and services grew 5-fold from \nMNT13 million to MNT61 million. Overall, local government expenditures have grown from 9.7% \nof GDP in 1995 to 13.0% in 2000, although they are expected to come down to 10.9% in 2002. \n \n18.  Expenditures and revenue collections vary greatly across the provinces: per capita \nrevenue collections ranged from MNT21,000 ($19.00) in Bayanulgii to MNT70,028 ($63.80) in \nOrkhon in 2002, or a ratio of almost 4 to 1, although it reflects an improvement over 1999 when \nthe ratio was 8 to 1. Per capita expenditures ranged from MNT51,947 ($47.20) in Uvurkhangai \nto MNT104,626 ($95.10) in Gobisumber, a ratio of 2 to 1. The extent of provinces\u2019 dependence \non the center is evident from ratios of local government expenditure to revenue. In 2002 the \nratio stood at 1.64 for all provinces, and at 2.20, excluding Ulaanbaataar. Only two provinces \n(Ulaanbaataar administration and Orkhon province) were net providers of revenue to the center, \nwhile all the others relied on net transfers and subsidies for more than 60% of their public \nexpenditures. Education and health have historically been the most decentralized sectors, \nwhere local governments have spent 70% and 63%, respectively, of the total expenditure.  \n \n19.  Until the end of 2002, provincial  governors negotiated their budgets directly with Ministry \nof Finance and Economy (MOFE) to secure the release of funds. District governors dealt with \nthe provincial governors for budgetary transfers. Under PSMFL, the line ministers will enter into \noutput purchase agreements with province governors for all service delivery, including health \nand education, and the budgetary allocations will be determined on the basis of output costs. \nHowever, entity capacity constraints on performance contracting are more prevalent at lower \ngovernment levels. These constraints need to be placed in the broader context of a number of \nother structural impediments at the provincial and subprovincial levels, including the following: \n(i)  continuing  tension  between  the  center  and  provinces  arising  from  disparities  between \nexpenditure responsibilities and limited decision-making authority devolved to the lower levels, \nand the resulting conflicts between self-governance and state control from the center; (ii) limited \nprovincial and district revenue-raising capacities; and (iii) multiplicity of administrative layers at \nprovincial,  district,  and  bagh  levels,  which  add  to  significant  public  administration  costs, \nincreased bureaucracy, as well as weak accountability. \n \n20.  Civil Service. Capacity constraints on performance and output-based management are \nexacerbated by fundamental problems faced by the civil service: (i) capacity constraints within \n ", "6 \n \nSSC  to  formulate  and  enforce  sound  guidelines  on  recruitment  and  performance-based \nmanagement; (ii) lack of transparency in hiring or firing civil servants; (iii) lack of a civil service \nculture, wherein a permanent, merit-based, career-track civil service system has not been \nestablished yet; (iv) frequent staff turnover, particularly at senior levels, caused by past frequent \nchanges in the Government; (v) lack of political neutrality of the civil service; (vi) widespread \nviolations of merit principles in recruitment or career progression; and (vii) lack of sound dispute \nresolution or administrative grievance settlement processes.  Meritocracy is a difficult goal to \nachieve under the current circumstances. \n \n21.  The largeness of the public sector has led to wage compression in the civil service and \nfrequently put significant pressure on the budget despite lower average wages than in the \nprivate sector. The monthly per capita wage in the public sector was $52 in 2001, as against the \nnational average of $67. A comprehensive functional review of the core and non-core functions \nof the public sector needs to be launched to guide future reforms. While the Government has \nformulated some short-run measures, including the social sector privatization program announced \nin July 2002, to corporatize and privatize or restructure 56 selected educational institutions and \nhospital facilities to contain public expenditures, the impact of such measures in isolation of other \nmedium- to long-term qualitative improvements is likely to be small. \n \n22.  Fiscal Pressures from the Pension System. The public pension system is a major \nsource of fiscal pressure. Pension expenditure as a share of GDP increased from 0.5% in 1990 to \n5.9%  in  2001,  which  is  much  higher  than  in  the  regional  average.12  In  view  of  the  fiscal \nsustainability  problems  faced  in  all  transition  economies  with  pay-as-you-go  pension \narrangements,  Mongolia  adopted  a  legal  framework  in  1999  based  entirely  on  individual \ncontributions, applying only to those born after 1960, and to become effective from 2010. Given \nthe  transition  costs  involved,  notional  balances  are  recorded  in  individuals\u2019  accounts.  The \nGovernment\u2019s plan is to convert a portion of the notional accounts into funded privately managed \naccounts, on the assumption that the pension system will begin to run a surplus by 2005. \nHowever, the overall system is in deficit, estimated at 1.6% of GDP.  \n \n23.  The pension system is fairly generous. A retiree gets 45.0% of the highest 5 years of \nwages, in addition to a 1.5% additional credit for each year of service over 20 years. The \naverage replacement rate stands at 65% of average wage, which represents almost a 100% \nreplacement rate as pension benefits are not taxed. However, until the mid-1990s, the real \nvalue of wages and pensions remained low because of significantly high inflation. There is no \ngood mechanism for indexation. For instance, pensions were not adjusted for inflation in 2000, \nbut were increased by about 10% in 2001. \n \n24.   While the retirement age is 60 for men and 55 for women, the actual average retirement \nages are 57 and 50, respectively. Only a quarter of the pensioners are 60 when they begin to \nreceive pension benefits. The ratio of pensioners to population above 60 years is close to 2, \nindicating significant early retirements. Life expectancy at the actual average retirement ages is \n20 years for women and 14 years for men. With the generous early retirement provisions, \nretirees do remain economically active yet receive pensions. An indication of these negative \npressures on the pension system is the forecast financial position of the pension fund. Without \nany transfers from the budget and any reform measures to increase the average retirement age, \nthe pension fund will be in deficit to the tune of about 9.0% of GDP by 2005, rising to 16.4% by \n2010, and 34.4% by 2020.  \n                                                 \n12 For example, the ratio is less than 1.5% of GDP in Kazakhstan and 2.6% in the People\u2019s Republic of China. ", "7 \n \n2.  Framework for Financial Management and Governance \n \n25.  The  Law  on  Accounting,  amended  in  2002,  is  based  on  international  accounting \nstandards (IAS) and covers private sector as well as public sector entities, including budgetary \nbodies. The law provides for an accounting standards committee to set private and public sector \naccounting standards and monitor their implementation. As per the law, the minister of finance \nand economy must provide implementation directions to the accounting profession. MOFE is \nresponsible for the final reconciliation and consolidation of all public sector budget  accounts, \nincluding those of central and local governments. The state property committee consolidates the \naccounts of SOEs separately, outside the budget. \n \n26.  With regard to public sector accounting, the budget classification system is broadly \nconsistent with internationally accepted government finance statistics principles. The budget \nsummarizes the financial position of the Government on a cash basis. With World Bank support, \na  new  chart  of  accounts  has  been  developed  for  the  Government,  based  on  accounting \nstandards  that  are  conducive  to  cash  and  accrual  bases.  GRP  helped  five  bunch-1  pilot \nagencies\u2014GDNT, CGA, SSC, NSO, and NAO\u2014convert to accrual accounting. This process \nneeds to be expanded across the public sector. \n \n27.  The State Audit Law, amended in 2003, provides the basic legal framework for financial \nand performance audit of all budgetary bodies. NAO, the supreme audit institution, implements \nthe law. Parliament appoints the chair of NAO, who, in turn, appoints the heads of NAO\u2019s 22 \nprovincial boards. The chair and heads report to and are directly accountable to the local \nassemblies. As per PSMFL, NAO, which has 275 staff at central and local levels, conducts \ncertification audits of the annual financial statements of all budgetary bodies and majority SOEs. \nThe Law on State Inspection, amended in 2003, guides the activities of the State Professional \nInspection Agency (SPIA), which was established under the Prime Minister\u2019s Office in early \n2003 by merging all the inspection agencies in  various line ministries. In particular, financial \ninspection of budgetary bodies is the core of SPIA\u2019s activities, a task previously carried out by \nthe State Financial Inspection Agency, which operated under MOFE. SPIA\u2019s finance and control \ndivision, which PSMFL entrusts with internal financial inspection of the Government, has 250 \ninspectors. \n \n28.  Three key organizations are involved in private sector accounting and auditing and have \noverlapping  roles  and  responsibilities:  Accounting  Policy,  Methodology,  and  Auditing \nDepartment  of  MOFE;  Mongolian  Institute  of  Certified  Public  Accountants  (MICPA);  and \nMongolian Professional Accounting Council (MPAC). MPAC was established by the Law on \nAccounting to license accounting firms and strengthen and regulate the accounting profession \nby performing the following functions: (i) recommend standards for accounting and auditing; (ii) \nreview the curricula for the certified public accountant (CPA) examinations, and provide courses \nfor candidates preparing for the exams; (iii) formulate and conduct CPA exams, and grant and \nrecord CPA certificates; (iv) process and review auditing licenses and make recommendations \nto the minister; (v) maintain a database on auditing companies; and (vi) formulate and ensure \nconformity with codes of professional ethics. \n \n29.  Under  PSMFL,  all  budget  entities  are  required  to  generate  accrual-based  financial \nstatements that are prepared in line with the international public sector accounting standards by \nthe end of 2003. PSMFL also  requires MOFE to consolidate these financial statements to \nprepare overall financial statements for the Government. Budget entities are responsible for \naccounting and financial reporting as well as financial management of their budget funds. \n ", "8 \n \nCentralized accounting systems and uniform chart of accounts are absent, and reports prepared \nby budget entities are in a multi-sheet form submitted to MOFE monthly and quarterly. These \nreports are not required to reconcile changes between the beginning and ending balances of a \nspecific period. Treasury consolidates these reports to produce government-wide reports, which \nmay not be accurate. \n \n30.  PSMFL provides for an independent role for budget entities by promoting entity-based \nfinancial  management.  Under  this  structure, internal control is important. However, neither \nMOFE nor the line ministries nor other budgetary bodies have any internal audit function to \ncarry out these responsibilities. The usefulness of internal audit functions is not well understood. \nWhile financial inspectors act as internal auditors of central budget governors at budget entities, \nthe scope of work of these inspectors is limited to inspection of certain documents. Central \nbudget governors generally appoint financial inspectors, and each central budget governor has \none or two financial inspectors on their payroll. Each line ministry also has its own inspection, \nmonitoring,  and  evaluation  division,  which  monitors  compliance  with  sector  laws  and \nregulations. However, most divisions have no qualified finance specialist or accountant, since \ntheir role is primarily to undertake compliance inspections for the ministries. \n \n31.  Duplication of functions, weak auditing and accounting procedures, and overall poor \ncapacity in MOFE, line ministries, budgetary bodies, SPIA, and NAO are some of the problems \nin implementing PSMFL, which requires effective and credible rules along with well-functioning \ninformation systems to improve weak financial management. Almost all private and public sector \naccounting is done on a cash basis. While budgetary bodies present accounting information that \nis relevant for accrual accounting, including data on inventory, fixed assets, accounts payables \nand receivables, etc., all such information is lumped together without any analysis by separate \nasset classes. For fixed assets, data are maintained for information purposes only by recording \nthem at their historical cost. There are no standards for asset revaluation to reflect their present \nvalue on the financial statements required by PSMFL.  \n \n32.  Despite the adoption of the Law on Accounting, which mandates IAS, progress has been \nseverely constrained due to lack of skills and capacity. In most cases, old systems are in place \nand  entries  are  simply  transposed  onto  the  new  IAS-compliant  financial  statements.  In \nparticular, asset valuation, expense recognition, and accounting for equity have significant \nproblems. While all enterprises have made some changes from the uniform accounting system, \nonly a few accountants have a reasonable understanding of IAS and how to apply them. \nAlthough accounting specialists of MOFE are to oversee the quality of accounting in private \nenterprises in various provinces and districts, such specialists only verify that financial reports \nhave been filed in the correct format, and do not examine the source material for correct \ntreatment. \n \nB.  Lessons Learned \n \n33.  In  formulating  the  proposed  program  cluster,  specific  attention  has  been  paid  to \nincorporating lessons learned from GRP and related TAs as well as ADB\u2019s evaluation on \nprogram lending. The GRP-II design is based on the following lessons: \n \n(i)  Performance-based  management  reforms  have  generally  not  been \nsuccessful. A key lesson from the evaluation of ADB\u2019s support for public sector \nreforms in the Pacific countries is that performance-based management has not \nsucceeded. While this has been due to the complexity of such reforms, Mongolia ", "9 \nhas the advantage of having PSMFL and a history of acute fiscal problems \nrequiring change. The Government and Parliament have demonstrated strong \ncommitment in designing the overall program. Significant support from funding \nagencies is envisaged for capacity building and policy reforms. \n(ii)  Proper sequencing of reforms is critical. GRP-II will adopt a gradual, learning-\nby-doing approach. The program cluster envisages implementation over 6 years, \nfrom 2003 to 2009. GRP-II will (a) focus on PSMFL-related training, (b) help \ninstitutionalize financial management reforms, (c) initiate measures to increase \nfiscal stability, and (d) mainstream reforms in key public institutions. GRP-II will \ntarget full integration of PSMFL-related measures in education, health and social \nwelfare, and labor, which together constitute close to 75% of the overall budget. \n(iii)  Stakeholder  participation  is  vital.  The  success  in  adopting  PSMFL  and \nimplementing the pilot phase has demonstrated the need for close and significant \nstakeholder involvement. GRP-II will build on this to introduce forward-looking \nreforms  based  on  stakeholder  consultations  in  social  security  reforms, \nadministrative consolidation, and anticorruption work. \n(iv)  Local  government  autonomy  and  public  sector  efficiency  should  be \nbalanced. The learning-by-doing approach and the cluster modality are intended \nto suggest mid-course corrections. The implementation of subprogram 1 will \nguide the level of flexibility between the central and local budgetary bodies. \n \nC.  Issues and Opportunities \n  \n34.  Although GRP was implemented as a pilot phase, the adoption of PSMFL and support by \nthe  Government  and  Parliament  for  a  comprehensive  fiscal  responsibility  system  are  good \nindicators of their commitment to long-term reforms. ADB and other aid agencies must coordinate \ntheir support for the reform momentum established under GRP to ensure that reforms stay on \ncourse and that good governance norms are fully mainstreamed through capacity building and \nstructural reforms. \n \n35.  Rationale and Links with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Country Strategy and \nProgram.  Governance  reform  in  general  and strengthening  of  public  sector  governance  in \nparticular are a key pillar of ADB\u2019s country operational strategy. It calls for (i) strengthening of \nfiscal discipline and strategic planning in the public sector; (ii) introduction of performance-based \nmanagement at central and local levels; (iii) infusion of transparent and efficient practices to guide \nintergovernmental  fiscal  and  administrative  relations;  (iv)  support  for  SOE  reforms;  and \n(v) formulation of effective interlinkages between public sector governance reforms and ADB\u2019s \nother  sector-specific  interventions,  which,  in  turn,  will  lead  to  enhanced  accountability  and \ntransparency in those sectors. \n \n36.  ADB has provided significant TA support over the last 5 years to formulate and implement \npublic sector  governance  reforms.  A  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  overall  governance \nframework, issues, challenges, and opportunities is being finalized. ADB has been the lead donor \nfor health, education, and social security reforms. Appendix 1 presents a list of ADB TAs and \nloans for broad public sector reforms. The Government has sought continuing ADB support for \nGRP-II. The program cluster builds on the reform initiatives launched under GRP to ensure the \nstability and sustainability of PSMFL-related measures.  \n \n ", "10 \n \nD.  External Assistance to the Sector and Donor Coordination \n \n37.  While GRP was the first program of support from an international financial institution for \ngovernance reforms, IMF, World Bank, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and \nbilateral agencies have supported public sector management reforms (Appendix 1). IMF has \nfocused on overall macroeconomic stability to ensure fiscal sustainability, advising on treasury, \nbudget management, tax, and customs reforms. The treasury single account system has been \nestablished with IMF\u2019s support. \n \n38.  World Bank\u2019s support for public administration reforms was initiated through the fiscal TA \nproject, approved in 1998 for $5 million, to support debt management, tax administration, and \ntreasury  reforms.  The  project  also  supported  a  major  public  expenditure  and  financial \nmanagement  review  in  2001,  which  was  finalized  in  July  2002.  The  review,  undertaken \nconcurrently by the Government with the formulation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper \n(PRSP), identified a number of constraints on, and weaknesses faced by, the public sector. \nBased on the review, and to support PRSP implementation, the World Bank plans to formulate \nthree poverty reduction strategy credits (PRSCs) in 2003-2007. The PRSCs\u2019 objective is to \ndevelop and implement policies and structural reforms consistent with and supportive of the \noverall economic development strategy in a sequenced and phased manner. PRSC1 is being \nproposed for $15 million, likely to be approved by October 2003. The sequence of PRSCs will \nbe as follows: (i) PRSC1 will support public sector reforms to achieve macro-fiscal stability; \n(ii) PRSC2 will focus on private and real sector reform and help create an environment for \nfavorable growth; and (iii) PRSC3 will support social sector reforms and improve access to, and \nthe quality and cost of providing, public services.  \n \n39.  The  World  Bank  has  also  designed  the  Economic  Capacity-Building  Technical \nAssistance Credit (ECTAC), for $8 million, to support PRSC implementation. ECTAC will focus \non  public  expenditure  management  reforms,  including  budget  formulation,  execution,  and \nreporting; measures to enhance accountability; and policy evaluation. ECTAC will also help \nSSC build its capacity in wage management and establish internal controls in the civil service. \nUNDP has provided advisory support under the Good Governance for Human Security (GGHS) \nProgram  and  also  led  coordination  of  donor  support  for  the  Government\u2019s  anticorruption \nmeasures through the National Council on Anticorruption, headed by the prime minister. The \nGovernment of Sweden is advising the Government on local government capacity building to \nstrengthen  organizational  management.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (USAID) has supported court system reforms. \n \n40.  GRP implementation and the consultative process leading to the adoption of PSMFL \nhave proved as useful windows for coordination between ADB and other funding agencies. The \ndivision of labor, as it has evolved with the World Bank and IMF, entails ADB coordinating \nPSMFL implementation. The PRSCs and PRGF will help formulate and adopt MTEF and \nstreamline  budget  processes.  PRSC1  will  aim  at  short-run  civil  service  reform  measures, \nincluding design of a database of civil  servants and adoption of a coherent system of civil \nservice processes. ADB will help ensure that the Government adopts a career-track civil service \nsystem at the end of GRP-II. It will help implement PSMFL-related provisions on accounting, \nand financial and performance auditing reforms, building on earlier ADB TA and World Bank \nsupport.  ADB  will  coordinate  closely  with  UNDP  to  enhance  public  confidence  in  the \nGovernment. \n ", "11 \nV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n41.  GRP-II aims to enhance public sector accountability and efficiency, to be measured by \nfiscal  sustainability  and  tangible  improvements  in  delivery  of  key  public  services.  GRP-II\u2019s \npurpose, following measures adopted under GRP on a pilot basis, is to help implement public \nsector administrative and financial management reforms. GRP-II will adopt a three-pronged \napproach: \n \n(i)   Enhance institutional capacity. \n \n(a)  Support  implementation  of  PSMFL-related  measures  on  strategic \nplanning and output-based budgeting, with focus on health, education, \nand social welfare and labor portfolios. \n(b)  Strengthen the institutional and implementation arrangements for financial \ngovernance norms in the public sector. \n \n(ii)  Improve fiscal sustainability.  \n \n(a)  Initiate  pension  reforms  to  alleviate  fiscal  pressures  on  the  budget \nstemming from the public pension system. \n(b)  Initiate administrative consolidation to reduce multiple layers of control \nthat impede efficiency and lead to waste of scarce resources. \n \n(iii)  Mainstream governance reforms.  \n \n(a)  Enhance the enforcement capacity of SSC to improve the quality of the \ncivil service. \n(b)  Enhance confidence in key public institutions. \n \nB.

GRP-II will undertake the following to enable reform: \n \n(i)  Mainstream governance reforms, centered on output and financial management \nmeasures in the public sector, which eventually will trickle down to the entire \neconomy through well-functioning government at all levels. \n(ii)  Design  the  cluster  program  to  facilitate  learning  by  doing,  by  gradually \nimplementing reforms in 2003-2009.13 This approach will (a) allow considerable \nflexibility and enable ADB to remain engaged in governance reforms, address \ncapacity constraints, and enable stakeholder consultations over a longer period \nof  time  than  otherwise  possible;  and  (b)  mitigate  the  risks  associated  with \nformulating and implementing a complex reform agenda in the run-up to, and \nimmediately after, parliamentary elections. \n(iii)  Support medium- to long-term administrative consolidation measures, which will \nhelp the Government achieve economies of scale in administration and delivery \nof public services. The cluster design will also enable extensive stakeholder \n                                                 \n13 Two TAs are included in the 2004-2005 program to help support broad policy analysis of some of the components \nof subprogram 1 and program preparation for subprogram 2. \n ", "12 \n \nconsultation and facilitate consensus building on optimal approaches to merge \nprovincial and district  administrations or consolidate the delivery of  essential \npublic services. \n(iv)  Target education, health, and social welfare and labor portfolios to complement \nand  leverage  reforms  supported  by  ADB  through  past  and  ongoing  sector-\nspecific interventions. \n \nC.  Policy Framework and Actions \n \n43.  The policy matrix in Appendix 2 outlines the measures supported under subprogram 1. It \nwill  support  a  number  of  mainstreaming  measures.  Subprogram  2,  as  outlined  under  the \nmilestones in Appendix 3, will support a series of critical follow-up measures to complete the \nenvisaged reforms, and ensure sufficient stakeholder consultations. Appendix 4 presents the \ndevelopment policy letter. The program logical framework is in Appendix 5. \n \n44.  The policy matrix is organized on the basis of the three main components. While GRP \nimplementation was completed in December 2002, GRP-II has adopted a seamless approach of \ntracking government reforms since enactment of PSMFL in June 2002. The principal aim of the \nGovernment since then has been to increase awareness of the law among the public officials to \nfacilitate its implementation. Subprogram 1 has 35 actions across the three components, and 1 \naction to ensure sufficient budget for a social safety net. As the program is proposed in \ncontinuity of GRP, the Government has complied with six important conditions before loan \nnegotiations. Of the remaining 29, 10 are indicated as core second-tranche release conditions, \nand 19 will be monitored throughout the program. \n \n1.  Enhance Institutional Capacity \n \n  a.  Implement PSMFL-Related Reforms \n \n45.  Adopt  an  Implementation  Framework.  To  continue  GRP,  the  Government  has \nundertaken  a  number  of  measures  since  adoption  of  PSMFL.  As  part  of  GRP-II,  the \nGovernment approved a PSMFL implementation plan in September 2002. It envisages a 3-year \ntime frame, 2003-2005, consisting of the following: (i) preparatory stage, July 2002-December \n2002, to undertake initial work on planning and budgeting, the new accounting and reporting \nsystem, performance and expenditure management systems, establishment of ex post audits, \nand transition to a centralized treasury management system; (ii) second stage, January 2003-\nDecember  2005,  to  introduce  an  output-based  management  system;  and  (iii)  third  stage, \nJanuary 2004 onward, to gradually devolve input delegation to lower-level entities. While a 3-\nyear time-bound plan has been adopted, the Government is acutely aware of the complexities of \nthe transition, particularly in light of the capacity constraints. Hence, the implementation plan will \nbe treated as a guide that may be amended as appropriate. \n  \n46.  Adopt Guidelines and Consequential Amendments to Legislation. The Government, \nwith ADB TA support, has published a detailed explanation guide in Mongolian on public sector \nfinance and management reforms and disseminated over 1,500 copies for use by portfolio \nministers, general managers, and key staff of the main agencies. The Government also drafted \nconsequential  amendments  to  75  laws,  necessitated  by  the  adoption  of  PSMFL,  which \nParliament enacted in January 2003. Of particular importance are amendments to the laws on \nbudget, civil service, government, and state audit, which clarify and reconcile their provisions \nwith PSMFL. The Government has also issued rules and regulations requiring line ministries ", "13 \nand budgetary bodies to present their budget estimates in a portfolio appropriation format, in \nline with the PSMFL requirements, on a trial basis in 2003, leading to full adoption of the new \nformat in 2005-2006. The approved budget for 2003 is presented on a portfolio basis. \n \n47.  Launch  Capacity-Building  Initiatives.  To  enhance  awareness  of  PSMFL,  the \nGovernment  has  formulated  a  capacity-building  program,  to  be  initially  funded  through \ncounterpart funds generated under GRP. All state secretaries in the line ministries (who are also \nthe ministries\u2019 general managers) and the general managers of all central budgetary bodies \nhave undergone an intensive training program on the basics of PSMFL. A training-of-trainers \nprogram  was  completed,  following  which  three  academic-cum-training institutions provided \nbasic training sessions on PSMFL implementation for central and local government officials in \nMay-July 2003. The Government will evaluate the outcomes and design the follow-up training \nphase. \n \n48.  Strengthen Strategic Planning and Output-Based Budgeting. As part of GRP, all the \n5 bunch-1 agencies formulated their strategic business plans (SBPs), while the 12 bunch-2 \nministries  and  agencies  started  to  do  so.  A  key  difficulty  for  central  ministries  has  been \nredefining their roles in the post-PSMFL environment, given the transition from focusing on \npolicy formulation and coordination, to undertaking overall sector management. Although the \nPSMFL  provides  for  considerable  flexibility  and  autonomy  to  provincial  and  district \nadministrations to define their strategic priorities, the law has simultaneously expanded the \nscope of oversight activities covered by the line ministries. Based on earlier SBPs produced by \na limited number of entities, the Government will monitor progress on revisions to the SBPs, \nwhich will be done continuously by all ministries and budgetary bodies. ADB TA support has \nbeen provided to Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science (MOSTEC), Ministry of Health \n(MOH),  and  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare  and  Labor  (MSWL)  in  preparing  for  PSMFL \nimplementation. In compliance with a second-tranche condition, these ministries will finalize \ntheir SBPs for 2004-2006, to ADB\u2019s satisfaction, by December 2003. By November 2003 \nMOSTEC,  MOH,  and  MSWL  will  also finalize the following: (i) output specification in the \neducation and health sectors, and standardized methodology and dissemination of the methods \nand formats for reporting; and (ii) sector-specific output-costing guidelines and instructions. By \nMarch 2004 the ministries will agree on quantitative norms on output costs against which their \nportfolio outcomes can be benchmarked. Advisory support under CBGR and other sector TAs \nwill focus on strengthening sector medium-term planning, which, in turn, will feed into improving \nSBPs by evaluating current service delivery performance in the key sectors.  \n \n49.  The output specification and costing process needs to be strengthened at all levels before \nthe budgetary bodies can comply with PSMFL provisions on finalizing portfolio appropriation \nestimates on the basis of outputs. In the interim MOFE will liaise with the line ministries to \nensure that the transition to output-based estimation is well managed. As part of GRP-II, in May \n2003 MOFE submitted to Parliament the fiscal framework statement for 2004-2006 and a draft \nMTEF. By October 2003 MOFE will also (i) formulate and issue the methodology for medium-\nterm expenditure planning on an accrual basis to all line ministries and budgetary bodies, and \n(ii) formulate guidelines and issue them to all line ministries and budgetary bodies to enable \nthem to finalize their portfolio appropriation estimates in line with PSMFL provisions. \n \n50.  Introduce Measures for Expenditure Discipline. The Government, through MOFE\u2019s \ncoordination with MOH, MOSTEC, and MSWL, will start assessing public sector administrative \nexpenditures incurred to fulfill the above portfolio responsibilities, and, by March 2004, set a \nceiling  on  such  expenditures.  The  Government  will  control  expenditures  and  encourage \ncoordinating agencies to conserve administrative resources and utilize the savings to provide \n ", "14 \n \nincentives to staff or upgrade infrastructure. The Government will also simultaneously prepare \nand submit a comprehensive report to ADB annually every October over 2003-2006, focusing \non (i) the quasi-fiscal activities and liabilities resulting from noneconomic state sector activities; \n(ii) contingent liabilities incurred by the Government; and (iii) arrears on taxes and payments to \nthe state budget, categorized by the defaulters\u2019 ownership structure. \n \nb.  Strengthen Financial Governance Norms in the Public and Private \nSectors \n \n51.  Establish Sound Oversight for Public Sector Accounting. Other than the Accounting \nPolicy, Methodology, and Auditing Department of MOFE, which is a policy and standards-setting \nbody, no coordinating department or official oversees actual public sector financial accounting. \nWhile all budgetary bodies are required to have an in-house chief accountant, most do not. \nThose  that  do,  have  accountants  who  lack  qualification  and  skills.  To  modernize  the \nGovernment\u2019s financial management system and establish practices leading to sound financial \nreporting to the Government and Parliament, government accounts must be under centralized \nleadership and controllership. By January 2004 the Government will establish a new accountant \ngeneral (AG) position at MOFE, with CPA qualifications, to be responsible for all ex ante \nfinancial  planning  and  ex  post  financial  reporting,  and  overall  government  accounting \nresponsibilities. Following ADB\u2019s approval of the proposed TA loan for CBGR, the Government \nwill (i) appoint an international senior advisor to the AG with support under CBGR, (ii) ensure \nthat a qualified incumbent staff is nominated as chief accountant in each portfolio ministry and \nprovince, and (iii) establish a hierarchical link between the AG and chief accountants of portfolio \nministries and provinces.  \n \n52.  The AG, who will have sound knowledge of accrual accounting and government financial \nmanagement  and  reporting,  will  direct  financial  management  systems  as  well  as  ensure \naccurate financial reporting by doing the following: (i) set accounting procedures, establish \nfinancial management policies, and monitor implementation of these regulations; (ii) develop \naccounting manuals to improve the quality of financial reporting; (iii) implement a uniform and \nintegrated chart of accounts for accounting, budgeting, and reporting for all government entities; \n(iv)  implement  international  public  sector  accounting  standards  (IPSAS);  (v)  approve  the \nappointment of chief accountants in portfolio ministries and budget entities, and monitor their \nwork plan and performance; (vi) assess the skills of all government accountants and establish \nbenchmarks for quality improvement; and (vii) certify government accountants, based on a well-\ndesigned examination and evaluation process. \n \n53.  Establish  Sound  Internal  Audit  Arrangements. A strong overall internal audit and \ncontrol environment is needed to promote sound financial management in portfolio ministries \nand  budget  entities  and  enable  them  to  respond  appropriately  to  significant  operational, \nfinancial, compliance, and other risks, including inappropriate use of assets or their loss from \nfraud. Liabilities must be identified and managed. Good internal and external reporting requires \nmaintenance of proper records, and processes that generate a flow of timely, relevant, and \nreliable  information  from  within  and  outside  budget  entities,  and  which  can  be  increased \nsignificantly through internal control. Internal audit also expedites compliance with applicable \nlaws and regulations, and also with internal audit policies. Accordingly, by January 2004, the \nGovernment will (i) establish internal control functions under the AG\u2019s Office, accountable to the \nAG,  led  by  the  head  of  internal  audit  (HIA);  (ii)  coordinate  the  nomination  of  a  qualified \nincumbent staff as an internal auditor in the portfolio ministries, including MOFE and provinces, \nreporting to the respective state secretaries and provincial governors; (iii) set up a hierarchical ", "15 \nlink between the HIA and internal auditors of portfolio ministries and provinces; (iv) ensure that \nthe AG formally defines the terms of reference of internal audits in line with the operational \nstandards issued by the Institute of the Internal Auditor; (v) ensure that the HIA obtains a \ngovernment  internal  audit  certificate  by  meeting  all  the  institute\u2019s  requirements;  and \n(vi) establish continued professional education requirements for internal auditors. \n \n54.  The following institutional structure for the AG and internal audit arrangements will be \nestablished (see Appendix 6 for more detail):  \n \n(i)  the  AG,  responsible  for  consolidating  the  financial  report  for  the  whole \nGovernment, will be located within MOFE (but different from the chief accountant \nin the Treasury or the Accounting Policy and Methodology Department) and \nreport to the state secretary of MOFE;  \n(ii)  heads of the accounting department in all portfolio ministries, including MOFE, \nand provincial administrations, will be nominated as chief accountant of the \nrespective entities;  \n(iii)  the chief accountant for MOFE will be outside the Treasury or accounting policy \nand methodology and auditing departments  to segregate the Treasury (including \ncash management) as well as accounting auditing policy-setting functions from \nfinancial accounting and reporting, and the MOFE chief accountant will perform \nthe same functions as the chief accountants in other portfolio ministries;  \n(iv)  an internal controller in each portfolio ministry (including MOFE) and provincial \nadministration, will be reporting to the state secretaries or general managers as \nappropriate; and  \n(v)  the HIA will initially be located within MOFE, and all the internal auditors will \nreport to the HIA, who, in turn, will report to the AG. \n \n55.  Enhance  Compliance  with  Internationally  Accepted  Norms  for  Public  Sector \nAccounting. The Government is in the process of officially recognizing IPSAS issued by the \nPublic Sector Committee of the International Federation of Accountants. Under GRP-II, by May \n2004 MOFE will draft and submit to Parliament amendments to the Law on Accounting to \nestablish a certified government accountant structure for the 3,180 public accountants at the \ncentral and local ministries, governors\u2019 offices, and various budgetary bodies. The amendments \nwill also provide for entry and qualification criteria to take effect on a time-bound basis, and for \njob classifications and categories. By May 2004 MOFE will also have designed an examination \nstructure and review courses to prepare candidates for the exams, and developed continued \nprofessional education requirements to certify government accountants. By November 2004 the \nGovernment will have conducted the first exam for government accountants. \n \n56.  Introduce Sound Asset Valuation Standards. To strengthen the rudimentary norms \nand practices used for asset valuation, by June 2005, with support from CBGR, the Government \nwill draft and adopt asset valuation standards on movable, immovable, and nonmaterial assets \n(e.g., trademarks, copyrights, etc.) that are comparable to international standards. \n \n57.  Make the Transition to Accrual Accounting. In line with PSMFL, the Government will \nofficially adopt the new chart of accounts (developed under the World Bank\u2019s fiscal TA project) \ndesigned to operate on cash and accrual bases. To guide the transition, under subprogram 1 \nand with support from CBGR, by June 2005 the Government will have implemented a pilot \nprogram for education and health to develop (i) an initial set of accrual-based accounts that will \nrecognize the receivables and payables at the end of each fiscal year, and (ii) asset registers for \nthe pilot sectors.  \n ", "16 \n \n58.  Enhance  Transparency  through  Financial  and  Performance  Auditing.  PSMFL \nentrusts NAO with financial and performance audits of public sector agencies. Under GRP-II, \nwith advisory support under CBGR, by May 2005 NAO will have conducted financial statement \naudits of (i) MOSTEC, MOH, and MSWL; and (ii) one province14 (to be undertaken through the \nconcerned state audit office) on a pilot basis, to be selected in consultation with ADB. By May \n2005 NAO will also have undertaken performance audits of selected functions and outcomes of \nCGA, GDNT, MOSTEC, MOH, and MSWL, and publish a summary of the audits in major \nnewspapers.  \n \n59.  Undertake  Forward-Looking  Measures  to  Improve  Financial  Management.  The \nGovernment  will  undertake  a  host  of  financial  management  reforms.  By  May  2005  the \nGovernment will have reviewed the functions of SPIA, particularly in financial inspection, and \nrestructure SPIA to ADB\u2019s satisfaction. The review objective will be to ensure that the internal \ncontrol functions are strengthened in each budgetary agency. By June 2004 the Government \nwill also have undertaken measures to improve the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework \nfor private sector accounting, and (i) separate MICPA from MOFE, (ii) abolish the Mongolian \nProfessional Accounting Council, (iii) translate international accounting and auditing standards \ninto Mongolian and adopt them verbatim, and (iv) draft amendments to the Law on Auditing to \nstreamline the CPA examination and certification process. \n \n2.  Improve Fiscal Sustainability \n \n  a.  Strengthen  the  Social  Security  System  to  Enhance  Fiscal \nSustainability \n \n60.  The Government, based on advisory support provided under earlier ADB TAs,15 will \nundertake some critical measures to enhance the fiscal sustainability of the social security \nsystem.  By  July  2004  MSWL  will  have  drafted  a  white  paper  on  pension  system  reform, \nfocusing on the need to increase retirement ages (by eliminating early retirement privileges and \nequalizing retirement ages of men and women), revamp the notional defined contributory \nsystem, and properly index pensions. By March 2005 MSWL will have disseminated the white \npaper for stakeholder consultations and finalized the reform measures to ADB\u2019s satisfaction. \nSubprogram 2 will pursue implementation of the reforms. \n \n  b.  Initiate  Central  and  Local  Administrative  Consolidation  to \nStrengthen Public Sector Resource Management \n \n61.  The Government has embarked on a plan to develop five regional centers to redress \nregional imbalances and evenly distribute the population. While the Government\u2019s objective is to \nachieve equity in growth across the country, any development of regional clusters may lead to \nadditional  layers  of  public  administration.  CS  and  MOFE  have,  therefore,  submitted  to \nParliament a draft law on the regional management providing that regional development will not \ncreate such additional layers or additional expenditure outlays. \n                                                 \n14 The Government has requested that the Ulaanbaatar city administration or some of its districts be chosen for this \npurpose, as the city accounts for close to 50% of revenues collected and 40% of public expenditures countrywide. \nAs the city administration is focusing on a number of anticorruption measures, financial and performance audits \nwould facilitate the administration\u2019s reform agenda. The advisors under CBGR will assess the needs and advise \nthe Government. \n15 ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Financial Sector Development. Manila; ADB. 1997. Technical \nAssistance on Social Safety Net. Manila.   ", "17 \n \n62.  The Government and public increasingly recognize that low population density in certain \nprovinces  will  threaten  local  fiscal  stability.  The  Government  has  devoted  attention  to \naggregation of localities, and is formulating a three-pronged approach: (i) explore the potential \nfor interprovincial consolidation, by considering the aggregation of Selenge and Darkhan in the \nnorth,  Gobi-sumber  and  Dornogobi  in  the  south,  and  Orkhon  and  Bulgaan  in  the  west; \n(ii) consolidate districts within several provinces; and (iii) establish inter- and subprovincial links \nto  consolidate  public  service  delivery,  including  health,  education,  taxation,  and  other \ncomponents of public administration.  \n \n63.  GRP-II will support intra- and interprovincial consolidation. As part of subprogram 1, by \nMarch 2004 the Government will have drafted a concept paper on administrative consolidation \nto improve public expenditure management and achieve economies of scale in service delivery, \nconsisting of a framework to consolidate the following: (i) selected contiguous provinces; (ii) \nselected  districts  within  the  same  or  other  provinces;  and  (iii)  selected  public  sector \nadministrative units, agencies and institutions, and service delivery functions in the selected \nprovinces and districts Such measures should not disrupt the quality of, or access to, public \nservices. The plan will include safeguards and social safety nets to provide for the short-run \ntransition costs as well as to mitigate adverse impacts of such measures. \n \n64.  As part of subprogram 2, the Government will establish consensus through consultations \nwith all the local stakeholders, including the public, local government officials, and provincial \ncitizens\u2019 representative assemblies. The Government will finalize the concept paper based on \nlocal  inputs,  and  start  to  formulate  a  legal  framework,  including  amendments  to  relevant \nlegislation, to achieve intra- and interprovincial consolidation. Subprogram 2 will also help the \nGovernment achieve such consolidation to enhance fiscal responsibility and achieve economies \nof scale and efficiency in public sector administration. The Government envisages the following: \n(i) four districts will be consolidated together to the satisfaction of stakeholders and ADB through \nconsultations, including by merging administrative jurisdictions and jointly providing services \nacross districts; and (ii) six provincial administrations will be consolidated into three. \n \n3.  Mainstream Governance Reforms \n \na.  Enhance Confidence in Public Institutions \n \n65.  Enhance Civil Service Culture. GRP-II will support several measures to strengthen \nSSC, supplementing advisory support from the World Bank, to establish a sound information \nsystem on civil servants and their working conditions. As part of GRP-II, SSC, with advisory \nsupport from ADB TA,16 will develop the criteria and a code of conduct on ethics for civil \nservants, which the Government will adopt by May 2004. SSC will (i) by May 2004 have \nadopted an enforcement mechanism to implement Parliament\u2019s rules on selecting candidates \nfor senior civil servant positions, and a grievance and dispute settlement mechanism for civil \nservants; and (ii) as  part of the regular annual report from SSC to Parliament, submit an \nassessment of the enforcement outcomes. \n \n66.  SSC will also (i) determine if the performance evaluation reports from selected ministries \nand provincial administrations are in line with SSC\u2019s evaluation requirements, and (ii) submit to \nParliament  an  overall  performance  evaluation  report  and  make  it  publicly  available.  This \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2002.  Technical Assistance for Strengthening Public Sector Administration and  Financial Management. \nSeptember. Manila. \n ", "18 \n \nexercise  will  be  repeated  for  all  ministries  and  provincial  administrations  for  reporting  on \noutcomes in FY2004. \n \n67.  Enhance  Transparency  and  Accountability  in  Key  Public  Institutions.  The \nGovernment has recently taken a number of commendable steps in this direction, including \nestablishment of the National Council on Anticorruption (NCAC), headed by the prime minister, \nwith  support  from  UNDP  under  the  GGHS  program.  However,  public  confidence  in  key \ninstitutions,  including  CGA  and  GDNT,  continues  to  be  low,  and  public  service  delivery \nmechanisms and utilization of budgetary funds in health and education sectors. In March 2003 \nNCAC adopted the Action Plan on Anticorruption, which focuses on improving confidence in \npublic institutions.  \n \n68.  Under GRP-II, in line with item 2 of the action plan and with support from UNDP and \nADB, CS will (i) coordinate the establishment of an NCAC subgroup to comprehensively assess \nthe  role,  performance,  and  efficacy  of  GDNT,  CGA,  and  service  delivery  mechanisms  in \neducation and health, with participation from civil society, academia, and Parliament, and limited \ngovernment representation; and (ii) formulate the subgroup\u2019s terms of reference to undertake \nthe  performance  assessments  and  design  remedial  measures.  This  subcomponent  will \ncomplement the financial and performance audit measures in para. 66. By June 2004 CS and \nthe NCAC subgroup, with support from UNDP and ADB, will have submitted a comprehensive \nassessment report and made it publicly available. The Government will start implementing the \nremedial measures outlined in the report by December 2004.  \n \n69.  Under GRP, a sample of SOEs finalized SBPs and concluded performance agreements \nwith MOFE. Under subprogram 2 the Government will improve SOE corporate governance and \ncomplete privatization after cleaning up any budgetary arrears and debts (Appendix 3). \n \n3.    Formulate Effective Social Safety Net Measures and Allocate Budgetary  \n  Resources \n \n70.  The forward-looking thrust of GRP-II will have an overall positive economic and social \nimpact by conserving public financial resources. None of the subprogram 1 measures are likely \nto have an adverse impact on the poor or vulnerable. However, to address social safety net \nneeds arising from the 2003\u20132009 overall reform program, the Government will allocate at least \n$500,000 each year in the annual budgets in 2004-2006. The Government has also agreed that \nthe formulation of specific measures under subprogram 2 will take into account the need for a \nsocial safety net arising from their implementation. \n \nD.  Financial Implications of the Reform Program \n \n71.  GRP-II  is  a  time  slice  of  the  10-year  governance  reform  roadmap.  Subprogram \nimplementation  will  cost  an  estimated  $34.1  million  equivalent  over  6  years  (Table  1)  to \nstrengthen  financial  management  systems,  implement  other  PSMFL-related  provisions, \nundertake structural reforms for administrative consolidation, pay for the social impact of the \nreform measures, and pay the net costs of infusing budgetary discipline into SOEs. While some \ncosts such as establishment of public service delivery facilities in regional centers to prepare for \nconsolidation are derived from the Government\u2019s draft MTEF, its full adoption will lead to \nperiodic reevaluation of the financing gaps and costs of reform programs and clarify the impact \nof structural adjustments. \n ", "19 \n72.  Public sector modernization has other costs that cannot be quantified yet. In particular, \nsubprogram 1 will support PSMFL implementation on a pilot basis while the Government \npursues reform of the entire public sector. To build consensus and support for reform, the \nGovernment will also have to enhance social capital, which is not quantified or included here. \nHence, the overall cost of the reform process is likely to be considerably higher than the \nsubprogram costs. \n \nFinancial Implications of the Governance Reform Program, Phase II (2003-2009) \n \nCost  \nReform Elements   ($ million equivalent) \n  Subprogram 1  Subprogram 2  Total \nStrengthening Financial Management Systems  7.0  3.0  10.0 \nNet Costs of Introducing Other PSMFL Provisions  5.0  2.0  7.0 \nRestructuring Costs Arising from Functional Review of    3.0  3.0 \nthe Public Sector \nEnsuring Service Delivery through Inter-provincial and  5.0  10.0  15.0 \nInter-district  Facilities  as  Part  of  Administrative \nConsolidation \nSocial Safety Net Needs   1.5  4.0  5.5 \nNet  Costs  of  Infusing  Budgetary  Discipline  through    10.0  10.0 \nClearing SOE Arrears before Privatization \nSavings from Pension Reform Measures    (16.4)  (16.4) \n      Total  18.5  15.6  34.1 \nPSMFL = Public Sector Management and Finance Law, SOE = state-owned enterprise. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n73.  A program loan of SDR9,699,000 ($13.5 million equivalent) is proposed to be provided \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources to support subprogram 1. The program loan will have a \nterm of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years. The interest charge  will be 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period of 8 years, and 1.5% per year for the remaining period. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Program Management \n \n74.  MOFE will be the executing agency for GRP-II and responsible for implementing all \nPSMFL-related measures, and reforms relating to public sector financial management and the \nsocial security system. CS will be the implementing agency for all the local government reform \nissues  and  the  civil  service  reform  component.  CS  will  also  ensure  that  all  cabinet-level \ncoordination needed to smoothly implement GRP-II is efficient. \n \n75.  Given the coverage of a number of cross-sectoral issues and the complexity of the \nreform measures agreed upon, GRP-II will follow the steering committee model adopted under \nGRP. A steering committee and an operational working group will assist MOFE and CS. The \nsteering committee will comprise the chief of CS (as head of the committee), minister of finance \nand economy, minister of social welfare and labor, economic advisor to the prime minister, and \ntwo representatives from the parliamentary working group on governance. The operational \nworking group will be led by the deputy minister of MOFE and comprise the deputy chief of CS \nin charge of local government reforms, head of MOFE\u2019s Fiscal Policy Department, head of \n ", "20 \n \nMOFE\u2019s  Accounting  Policy  Department,  head  of  MSWL\u2019s  pension  department,  head  of  a \nrelevant department of SSC, and head of administration of NAO. \n \n76.  The Government will establish a GRP-II program implementation unit (PIU) in MOFE \nbefore loan negotiations with support from domestic and international consultants under ADB \nTA  grants  and  the  TA  loan  for  CBGR.  The  PIU  will  comprise  at  least  three  counterpart \nsupporting staff, with one nominated from CS and the others from MOFE. The PIU will report to \nthe state secretary of MOFE and shall coordinate with the operational working group monthly to \nreport on progress. The PIU will coordinate quarterly progress reports to ADB on GRP-II and \nCBGR implementation and submit a program completion report after the Government complies \nwith all the tranche-release conditions that can be monitored. The deputy minister of MOFE and \ndeputy chief of CS will inform the steering committee monthly of all key aspects of GRP-II. \n \n2.  Period of Implementation \n \n77.  Subprogram 1 will be implemented beginning from board approval to December 2005. \nDepending subprogram 1\u2019s progress, the subprogram 2 proposal may be presented to the \nBoard for consideration in the first quarter of 2006 and implemented until mid-2009. ADB will \nprepare an interim program completion report, outlining the progress under subprogram 1, along \nwith a finalized policy matrix to guide subprogram 2 based on milestones. A program completion \nreport for the whole cluster will be prepared within 12-18 months after completion of subprogram \n2. \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement \n \n78.  The proceeds of the program loan under subprogram 1 will be withdrawn in accordance \nwith ADB's standard disbursement procedures. Before submitting the first application to ADB for \nwithdrawal from the loan account, the MOFE will open a deposit account at BOM, into which all \nwithdrawals will be deposited. The deposit account will be established, managed, and liquidated \nin accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001). ADB reserves the \nright to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the validity of the certification issued by \nthe governments with each withdrawal application. \n \n79.  In accordance with the simplified disbursement and procurement procedure for program \nloans, the loan proceeds may be utilized to procure goods and services (excluding local duties \nand taxes) produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member countries, other than those specified \nin the list of ineligible items (Appendix 7) and those financed by other multilateral and bilateral \n \nofficial sources, and imports from non-ADB member countries. All procurements under the loan \nwill be done through normal commercial practices for the private sector or the Government\u2019s \nprescribed  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB,  with  due  consideration  given  to \neconomy and efficiency. No supporting import documentation will be required if, during each \nyear in which the loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of the Government\u2019s \ntotal imports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed \nunder  other  official  development  assistance  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  loan  amount \nexpected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will, however, certify with each \nwithdrawal request its compliance with this formula. Otherwise, import documentation under \nexisting procedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds \nand verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification.  ", "21 \n \n4.  Monitoring and Tranching \n \n80.  A cluster program modality comprising subprograms 1 and 2 is proposed. Subprogram 1 \nwill have two tranches. Periodic reviews of implementation progress under subprogram 1 will \nlead in seamlessly to formulating the full reform agenda under subprogram 2, developed on the \nbasis of the milestones in Appendix 3. The first tranche of subprogram 1, of SDR3.592 million \n($5.000  million  equivalent),  will  be  released  upon  approval  of  GRP-II  by  ADB  and  loan \neffectivity.  Subject  to  satisfactory  fulfillment  of  all  the  second-tranche  release  conditions \nappearing in bold in the policy matrix, and other program conditions that can be monitored, the \nsecond tranche of SDR6.107 million ($8.500 million equivalent) is expected to be released by \nJuly 2005.  \n \n81.  To finance subprogram 2\u2019s adjustment costs, ADB\u2019s lending program for 2006 has \nallocated $10 million equivalent based on the forecast indicative planning figures and availability \nof Special Funds resources. ADB\u2019s support will depend on the final scope of subprogram 2 as \nwell as the availability of Special Funds resources. Subprogram 2 will also be divided into two \ntranches, and the amounts disbursed will be decided during design of subprogram 2. \n \n5.  Program Review \n \n82.  Given the reforms\u2019 complexity, ADB will adopt an analytical approach to monitoring \nprogram implementation and the reform outcomes. At least three reviews are planned every \nyear during program implementation and progress of policy reforms. The Mongolia Resident \nMission will help coordinate the addressing of emerging issues and needs. The governance \nreform TAs proposed for 2004-2005 will include evaluation of the costs and benefits of policy \nmeasures, and assessment of overall PSMFL implementation, integrity of MTEF in key sectors, \nand stakeholder views on consolidation and other measures. These steps in turn, will help the \nGovernment comply with subprogram 1, and feed into the formulation of subprogram 2. The \nanalytical approach will also help the Government formulate mid-course corrections in the \noverall reform exercise. \n \nVI.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN \n \nA.  Objective and Scope \n \n83.  The  TA  loan  for  CBGR  will  help  the  Government  enhance  its  overall  capacity to \nimplement the key GRP-II governance-related measures through interim management, on-the-\njob training programs, and technical support. CBGR will cover the following: \n \n(i)  financial management reforms in public sector accounting, auditing, and asset \nvaluation; \n(ii)  support for strategic planning of PSMFL implementation; and \n(iii)  software and limited hardware support to efficiently undertake output costing, and \nfinancial statement and performance audits. \n \nB.  Components \n \n84.  CBGR will provide for long-term advisors who will (i) help senior management in MOFE \nand other selected ministries implement PSMFL; (ii) provide on-the-job guidance and training to \nthe staff of ministries; (iii) identify areas that need improvement; and (iv) undertake system \n ", "22 \n \ndesign for financial and performance audits, and install hardware and software, based on the \ntechnical assessments. In total, the TA will provide international consulting services for 53 \nperson-months and domestic consulting inputs for 120 person-months. Appendix 9 presents the \nterms of reference for the positions. \n \n85.  Establish Sound Oversight for Public Sector Accounting and International Audit \nArrangements. To modernize the Government\u2019s financial management system and establish \npractices leading to sound financial reporting to the Government and Parliament, CBGR will \nprovide 18 person-months of international advisory assistance to the AG, intermittently, over 36 \nmonths. The resident advisor will be a CPA with government accounting and financial reporting \nexperience in market economies and preferably with experience in transition economies as well. \nThe resident advisor will help the AG direct financial management systems as well as build up \naccurate financial reporting for the Government. In line with their terms of reference (Appendix \n8), the AG and resident advisor will be jointly implement the policy matrix to establish oversight \nfor public accounting and internal control arrangements. The resident advisor will also review \nfunctions of financial inspectors in budget entities and portfolio ministries to see if their job \nresponsibilities can be converted into internal audit functions through training to develop and \nstrengthen their internal audit capacity. This review will serve as a foundation for the proposed \ncentral  internal  audit  unit  under  the  AG\u2019s  Office,  and  internal  audit  units  in  the  portfolio \nministries, provinces, and budgetary entities. \n \n86.  Undertake financial statement and performance audits. CBGR envisages advisory \nsupport for 18 person-months intermittently over 36 months to help NAO conduct financial \nstatement and performance audit. This support will be provided through on-the-job training for \nNAO staff assigned to financial statement and performance audits. In consultation with NAO\u2019s \nsenior management, the audit advisors will identify special needs of NAO staff and arrange for \nshort-term classroom training programs. A team of two international auditors will be mobilized to \nwork with 18 auditors of NAO to conduct financial statement and performance audits. Financial \nstatement audits will be undertaken for MOSTEC, MSWL, and MOH, and for one province on a \npilot basis, to be selected in consultation with ADB. Performance audits will first be undertaken \nfor functions and outcomes, to be selected in consultation with ADB, of MOSTEC, MSWL, MOH, \nCGA, and GDNT, and a summary of the audits published in major newspapers.  \n \n87.  Develop Asset Valuation Standards. MOFE will be assisted with 2 person-months of \ninternational consulting services in drafting asset valuation standards in line with international \nstandards, and in preparing a user\u2019s manual to apply them.  \n \n88.  Support Strategic Planning Processes to Implement PSMFL. This component, with \n13 person-months of international advisory inputs, will provide overall strategic planning, output \nspecification, and costing support, in line with PSMFL requirements, to MOH, MOSTEC, MSWL, \nMinistry of Infrastructure, and two other ministries to be selected in consultation with MOFE, \ndepending on the  level of preparedness and a needs assessment. This process will entail a \ncomprehensive  assessment  of  the  strategic  focus,  policy  orientation,  output  planning, \ninterministerial and interagency coordination, and progress in PSMFL implementation within the \nselected portfolios. Based on these assessments, time-bound strategic plans with measurable \nbenchmarks will be formulated to guide process-oriented as well as structural reforms. The \nadvisory component will also help NCAC implement the subcomponent to enhance confidence \nin public institutions.  \n \n ", "23 \n89.  Modernize Financial Management. This component will have two modules. The first \nwill help NAO develop a software package for financial statement and performance audits, by \nusing system-based computerized methods. The second module will help modernize the output-\ncosting processes in all portfolios. A needs assessment will evaluate the hardware and software \nat central and local budgetary bodies. The module will help MOFE procure a modern output-\ncosting program with full licensing rights for use by a large number of budgetary entities. \nHardware and basic software support will be provided selectively. The output-costing software \nand associated training are anticipated to be provided to about 3,000 accountants. To support \nthe software and hardware assessments and design, an international management information \nsystems expert will be recruited for 2 person-months. \n \nC.  Cost, Financing Plan, and Implementation Arrangements \n \n90.  The total cost of the capacity-building activities is estimated at $2.4 million, of which it is \nproposed that ADB provide $2 million equivalent (SDR1.437 million) from its Special Funds \nresources. The Government will provide $400,000 equivalent in counterpart facilities. The TA \nloan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and carry an interest \ncharge of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per year for the remaining period. \n \n91.  All international and domestic consultants will be recruited on an individual basis by the \nPIU through competitive selection. All consultants will be recruited in accordance with the ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to the ADB for the \nselection and engagement of domestic consultants. CBGR will be implemented over 3 years, \nfrom October 2003 to September 2006. MOFE will be the executing agency, with coordination \nand implementation support provided by CS for strategic planning. The PIU, directly working \nunder and reporting to state secretary of the ministry of finance and economy, will be in charge \nof day-to-day implementation. The PIU will submit quarterly progress reports to ADB on CBGR \nimplementation until all TA loan activities are successfully completed.  \n \n92.  Procurement of goods and services from ADB loan funds will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  procurement  of  hardware  and  software  for  the \nmanagement  information  systems  component  will  be  based  on  international  shopping \nprocedures. The PIU will establish one imprest account in foreign currency at a commercial \nbank acceptable to ADB, to disburse funds to procure equipment and fund operating costs. The \naccount will receive an initial deposit upon loan effectiveness of $150,000 for the first 6 months \nof  implementation,  including  for  payment  to  domestic  consultants  and  procurement  of \nequipment and materials. Eligible operating expenditures under CBGR will be reimbursed or \ndrawn from the imprest account advance against satisfactory statements of expenditure subject \nto a maximum for any single payment of $50,000, in accordance with procedures acceptable to \nADB, and in accordance with the Loan Disbursement Handbook.  \n \n93.  MOFE  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting \nprinciples, with sufficient detail to identify all goods and services financed under CBGR and to \nindicate  the  use  to  which  they  were  put.  The  accounts  (including  financial  statements, \nstatements  of  expenditure,  and  imprest  accounts  records)  will  be  audited  annually  by \nindependent external auditors acceptable to ADB. Separate records will be maintained for the \nimprest account. ADB reserves the right to audit these accounts at any time. Costs for annual \naudits throughout CBGR implementation have been included in TA loan costs. MOFE will \nsubmit certified copies of the audited accounts and the auditor\u2019s report to ADB within six months \nof completion of each fiscal year. MOFE will also provide ADB with any reasonable additional \n ", "24 \n \ninformation concerning the TA loan accounts and financing that ADB may request from time to \ntime.  \n \nVII.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits \n \n94.  Overall Benefits. GRP-II will have institutional, fiscal, and public service-user benefits. \nBy mainstreaming modern management reforms in line with PSMFL, the program will help \nincrease  public  sector  capacity.  Enhanced  efficiency  will  lead  to  lower  administrative \nexpenditures as well as improved service delivery. The program will directly help reduce the \npressures on the budget through pension reforms and administrative consolidation. \n \n95.  Administrative  and  Financial  Management  Reforms.  By  instituting  measures  for \nsound strategic planning on output delivery, GRP-II will help define the role of each public sector \nagency, and cost the outputs so that entity budgets can be formulated accurately. While \nprovinces have derived most of their revenues through resource transfers from the center, \ndetailed ex ante or ex post financial reports have not been required. PSMFL requires all entities \nto  prioritize  and  formulate  their  medium-term  financial  needs,  unlike  before  when  ad  hoc \ndemands were placed on the center, and to submit complete financial statements at the end of \nthe budget cycle, presenting all relevant information on revenues and expenditures. GRP-II will \nprovide  extensive  policy  and  capacity-building  support  for  PSMFL\u2019s  financial  management \nreforms. GRP-II will institutionalize oversight arrangements at the highest level by establishing \nthe AG\u2019s office at MOFE, and at the level of the spending units by setting up internal control \nunits. These and the financial and performance audits will help enhance transparency and \naccountability, besides cutting expenditures through improved internal controls. As GRP-II will \nprimarily focus on health, education, and social welfare and labor, the reforms will release \nscarce resources to improve the quality and quantity of public services in these sectors. \n \n96.  Enhancing Fiscal Sustainability. GRP-II aims to enhance fiscal sustainability. While \nPSMFL requires strategic planning, output, performance, and financial management reforms, \nequally critical are policy reforms in certain key areas such as social security. GRP-II measures \nwill strengthen the pension system by gradually eliminating early retirement privileges and ad \nhoc increases in pensions, and by equalizing the retirement ages for men and women. These \nmeasures will benefit the central budget in the long run and help enhance fiscal sustainability. \nLocal  administrative  consolidation  measures  will  enhance  economies  of  scale  in  service \ndelivery.  \n \nB.  Impacts \n \n97.  Poverty Impact. Appendix 9 presents the poverty impact assessment. Subprogram 1 is \nnot expected to have any adverse social impact or negative consequences for the poor. By \ntargeting public sector administration and financial management reforms in education, health, \nand social welfare, GRP-II will ensure that the scare resources are utilized well. Subprogram 2 \nadministrative consolidation measures may have a short-term adverse impact on the poor and \nother vulnerable groups run, particularly in education, health, or other social service delivery. \nWhile the Government aims to consolidate provision of such facilities and not eliminate them, \nthe location of certain segments of the population may reduce their access to essential social \nservices. The Government has agreed to formulate appropriate measures to mitigate any \nnegative impact of such reforms on the poor. ", "25 \n \n98.  The Government signed a poverty partnership agreement with the ADB in March 2000. \nTwo annual reviews have been undertaken. Over The Government has undertaken several \nmeasures to promote the mainstreaming of poverty reduction in all development activities.  \n \n99.  Other Social Impact. Subprogram  1  will  not  lead  to  any  other  social  impact.  The \nadministrative consolidation measures under subprogram 2, depending on their nature and \nscope, may lead to changes in the configuration and provision of public services. If areas \ntargeted by subprogram 2 suffer decreased access to facilities, the Government will institute \nmeasures to mitigate such outcome. \n \n100.  Environmental Impact. None of the GRP-II measures are likely to have any adverse \nimpact on the environment. \n \nC.  Potential Risks \n \n101.  Institutional reforms, particularly in the public sector, are subject to various risks. In GRP, \nthe adoption of PSMFL was delayed due to several political risk factors. Subprogram 1 entails \nfewer risks as the policy and legal framework has already been adopted. In particular, since the \nGovernment has effectively campaigned on the need for the public sector management reforms, \nthe follow-up measures formulated under GRP-II are sufficiently credible. However, some of the \nmeasures in subprograms 1 and 2 are likely to face risks. \n \n102.  First, the implementation of PSMFL has to be efficiently managed. The law requires \nmajor changes in entity-level management practices. For instance, performance management \nreforms  need  detailed  contractual  agreements  between  portfolio  ministries  and  local \ngovernments, and budgetary bodies. ADB has emphasized gradual implementation, guided by \nlearning by doing, to ensure that capacity constraints within the civil service do not lead to \nfatigue. Yet, a whole range of  performance or output delivery contracts has been drawn up. \nCentral  and  local  civil  servants,  while  recognizing  the  need  for  reforms,  have  expressed \nreservations that PSMFL has led to considerably more \u201cpaper work.\u201d Ongoing TAs as well as \nthe proposed TA loan for CBGR will provide significant capacity-building support to alleviate \ncapacity constraints, and assuage the concerns of civil servants. \n \n103.  Second, pension reform anywhere is complex as it involves difficult policy choices, \nincluding  elimination  of  early  retirement  privileges,  which  may  affect  laborers  in  certain \nindustries. However, the Government recognizes that the pension system will face serious \nfinancing problems unless its generous provisions are changed. Significant advisory support \nhas been provided to analyze various options, guided by sound actuarial modeling. Based on \nthis, MSWL has drafted guidelines on social security reforms. Subject to cabinet endorsement of \nthese guidelines, the Government will initiate the drafting of necessary legal amendments. \n \n104.  Third, measures relating to administrative consolidation do carry considerable risks. The \nGovernment has conducted a preliminary analysis of this area. Some stakeholders have been \nconsulted, although their acceptance of or resistance to the reform measures can be gauged \nonly when the Government finalizes its concept paper and holds well-structured consultations \nwith local citizens\u2019 representative assemblies. The Government is confident that the much-\nneeded reforms can be facilitated if consolidation measures are designed gradually with local \ninputs. \n \n ", "26 \n \n105.  Fourth, political risks are associated with any program of this nature. In particular, \nMongolia will go for parliamentary elections in mid-2004. The present Government may not want \nto undertake any serious reforms just before or after the elections. Short-term concerns of local \ngovernments with regard to implementing PSMFL and their resistance to administrative or \nstructural changes may prevail over any long-term need for public sector reforms. Two factors \nmay cushion overall political risks. First, the Government and the Parliament have been fully \ncommitted to public sector reforms. Despite a major change in the Government in 2000, reforms \nwere implemented in a fairly smooth manner. It is also in the Government\u2019s and Parliament\u2019s \nbest interest to ensure that the PSMFL-related follow-up measures are implemented well. \nSecond, the cluster program modality gives the Government greater flexibility than otherwise \npossible. While it defines the broad policy framework, the Government can formulate the \nspecific  reform  measures  over  a  period,  based  on  the  outcomes  of  subprogram  1 \nimplementation. \n \nVIII.  ASSURANCES \n \n106.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which will also be incorporated in the legal documents, that it will do the following: \n \n(i)  Fulfill all the conditions specified in the policy matrix to release the tranches of \nthe program loan and will furnish ADB with copies of all documents evidencing \ncompliance with such conditions. \n(ii)  Ensure  that  all  the  policies  adopted  and  actions  taken  as  described  in  the \nprogram framework and the development policy letter continue in effect during \nand after program implementation. \n(iii)  Keep  ADB  informed  of,  and  exchange  views  with  ADB  on,  the  progress, \nproblems, and constraints encountered during GRP-II implementation and on \ndesirable changes to overcome or mitigate such problems and constraints. \n(iv)  Keep ADB informed of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral aid \nagencies that have implications for GRP-II implementation, provide ADB with the \nopportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals, and ensure that ADB\u2019s \nviews are considered before such proposals are finalized. \n(v)  Establish a steering committee for GRP-II within one month of loan effectiveness. \n(vi)  Implement  the  TA  loan  on  time  and  efficiently  so  that  the  program  loan \nrequirements will be met as stipulated. \n(vii)  Use  the  counterpart  funds  to  finance  the  adjustment  costs  of  implementing \nreforms as envisaged under GRP-II, except as ADB may otherwise agree. \n \nIX.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n107.  I am satisfied that the proposed program cluster concept, program loan and technical \nassistance loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB and recommend that the \nBoard approve \n \n(i)  the program cluster concept of $25,500,000 equivalent for the Second Phase of \nthe Governance Reform Program in Mongolia; \n \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 9,699,000 to \nMongolia for subprogram 1 of the Second Phase of the Governance Reform \nProgram, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate ", "27 \nof 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term \nof 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \nLoan Agreement presented to the Board; and \n \n(iii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 1,437,000 to \nMongolia for technical assistance for capacity building for governance reforms, \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1% \nper annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Technical \nAssistance Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n \n \n8 September 2003 \n ", "Appendix 1  28\n \nSUPPORT FROM FUNDING AGENCIES FOR GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC SECTOR \nREFORMS IN MONGOLIA \n \n1.

Mongolia  is  a  large  and  geographically  diverse  country.  Its  landlocked  location,  in\nbetween  much larger countries,  poses it with a lot of opportunities  as well as challenges.  Among\nthe  transition  economies,  Mongolia  achieved  impressive  performance  in the  first  half  of the\n1990s,  immediately  following  the dismantling  of the ,command system.  The decline  in economic\nfall  was  reversed  in  a  span  of  4  years  (GDP  grew  by  2.3%  and  6.3%  in  1994  and  1995\nrespectively).  However,  the  large  size  of  the  country  has  meant  that  the  resource  needs  in\ncountry'  economy  have  also been  significant.  The  second  half of the  1990s  saw a building  up\nexpenditures  stemming  from lack of fiscal  discipline  at various  levels. As a result,  we recorded\nlarge fiscal  deficits  until 1999, at 12.5% of gross domestic  product  (GDP) in 1998 and  10.6%  of\nGDP in 1999.\nA. The Governance Reform Program\n2.  In order  to  enhance  fiscal sustainability,  Mongolia  has  pursued  public  sector  reforms\nactively  since  the  mid-1990s,  with  support  from  multilateral  and  bilateral  donors,  including  the\nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  World  Bank,  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  United\nNations  Development  Program,  USAID, and Government  of Japan,  among others.  We began  to\nfocus  on  governance  reforms  in  1996,  with  a series  of  technical  assistance  (T A)  from  the\ndonors.  Our  initial  attempts  were  centered  on short-term  measures  on fiscal  management  In\n1998,  we  sought  ADB's  support  in  undertaking  a  comprehensive  program  of  governance\nreforms.  Subsequently,  a  10-year  Governance  Reform  Program  (GRP)  was  formulated  and\nstarted  to implement  by the  Government  and ADB  in 1999 to reform  the  dysfunctional  public\nsector  in  Mongolia,  which  had  contributed  to  large  fiscal  deficits,  led  to  misallocation  of\nbudgetary  resources,  adversely  affected  operational  efficiency  and effectiveness  of government\nservices,  and  undermined  public  and  private  sector  investments  and  growth,  and  efforts  to\nreduce  poverty.\n3.  While the GRP was fonnulateda nd approvedd uringt he previousG  overnment'st enure,\nmuch of its main mandatew  as implementeda fter the present Governmentc ame to power in\nmid-2000. The implementation of  GRP has achieved several significant milestones: the", "Appendix4   40\nforemost being the enactment of the Public Sector Management and Finance Law (PSMFL),\nwhich places Mongolia ahead of the other countries that have adopted similar public sector\nreforn1 measures. The extensive consultative  process leading to the enactment of PSMFL is\nevidence in favor of stakeholder participation, a key indicator in itself of good governance.\n4.  GRP  also  supported the  introduction  of  budget,  output  and financial  management\nreforms on a pilot basis in 2 sets of agencies. The primary focus was on showcasing the actual\nprocess through  implementation of the  reform measures in Custom General Administration\n(CGA), General  Department of  National Taxa~5eIf1)~ational  Statistical Organization\n- \n(NSO), State Audit Board (subsequently renamed as Nationa~A  udit Office  NAO) and State\nService Council (SSC).  This was replicated on a selective basis in a set of \"bunch 2\" agencies,\nincluding Ministry of  Finance and  Economy  (MOFE); Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor;\nMinistry of Justice and Home Affairs,  Ministry of Education, Culture, and Science; Ministry of\nHealth;  Ministry  of  Environment;  State  Financial  Inspection  Department;  Environmental\nProtection Agency; Land Administrative Authority;  State Meteorological Agency; and Clinical\nHospital No.1. In addition, GRP also focused on two pilot aimags, Arhangi and Selenge, and the\nNalaikh District Administration, a jurisdiction within Ulaanbaatar City, to pilot test administrative\nreforms at the provincial and sub-provincial levels.\n5.  Mr. President, let me highlight some of the key achievements under GRP, to place the\ncurrent reform agenda in context. To improve fiscal management and provide coherence in\nexpenditure  planning,  the  Govemment  formulated  and  adopted  a  basic fiscal  framework\nstatement  (FFS)  FFS  for  2001-2003.  The  FFS  aims to develop  sustainable fiscal  deficit\nforecasts over the medium term by ensuring consistency with the strategic growth priorities and\nprojections, and external and domestic borrowing capacity. The Government also prepared\nguidelines for incorporating contingent liabilities in annual budgets and estimated accumulation\nof liabilities at the aggregate level and within the five bunch 1 agencies.\n6.  To bring about budgetaryd iscipline,t he GRP's focus was on process-orientedre  forms\non a pilot basis for a limited numbero f budgetaryb odies. Fuller applicationo f the medium-term\nexpendituref ramework( MTEF),w ork on which has been launched,a nd output-basedb udgeting\nmeasuresw  ill graduallyr esult in integratings trategicp  rioritiesw  ith overall expenditurep lanning\nat all levels of the Government.A lso, recourse to off-budgetaryf unds and ad hoc transactions\nfrom the central to local governmentso r between budgetaryb odies on a barter basis is being\nreduced. These and the other measuresb eing adopted by the Governmenta s part of the GRP\nin line with the financial and personnel managementp  rovisions of the PSMFL are likely to\nfacilitate expenditured isciplinea s well as revenue enhanceme~ti n the mediumt erm.\n7.  As a part of the GRP, the Government  with  support  of IMF took initiatives  to establish  a\nnew treasury  single  account  (TSA)  system.  Under  Government  Decree  132 of 2001,  TSA was\nintroduced  on a pilot basis in 11 public  sector  agencies.  The TSA system  involves  transference\nof the government  deposits  in the banking  system  into a single account  at BOM to centralize  all\ndisbursement  and  accounting  responsibilities  at MOFE.  The  Government  has  closed  all  off.\nbudget  bank  accounts  held  by the  ministries  and  public  sector  agencies.  A comprehensive\nsurvey  of all extra budgetary  funds  has been  undertaken  to facilitate  proper accounting.  Based\non  the  successful  outcomes  in  the  pilot  agencies,  effective  July  2002  the  TSA  has  been\nextended  to cover the entire budgetary  bodies.\n8.  To  provide  a strategic  focus  to the  process  of budget  formulation  and  execution,  the\nGovernment  developed  the Development  Vision  for 2003-2005  and the Economic  and  Social\nDevelopment  Guidelines  for 2002. These  documents,  in combination  with the Action  Plan of the", "Appendi4x   41\nGovernment  of  Mongolia for  2000-2004,  establish  the  strategic priorities to  guide  budget\nformulation over the medium term. To better implement these priorities, a 3-year  rolling PIP\nframework  has  been formulated  as  an  integral  part of  the  MTEF. The  PIP framework  is\nintegrated with recurrent budgets to ensure adequate maintenance of the capital investments\nundertaken. The PIP is being presented to external assistance agencies and finalized annually\nbased on confirmed commitments.\n9.  Under the GRP, the Government  has further  adopted  the framework  for a rolling output-\nbased  MTEF,  including  the  development  of  a  system  of  forward  estimates,  to  impr~~\n~\nlinkages  between  planning  and budgeting.  This process  first established  a system for integrating\nthe requirements  of the line agencies  into the MTEF, which was initially piloted  in the five bunch\n1 agencies.  The  actual  process  of  deciding  on the  top-down  and  bottom-up  elements  of the\nMTEF has involved  a number  of steps, including:  (i) national  articulation  of fiscal  objectives  and\nstrategies;  (ii) macroeconomic  forecasting  and assessment  of resource  availability;  (iii) issuance\nof indicative  sector budgetary  ceilings  approved  by COM;  (iv) determination  of subprograms  by\nministries  and agencies;  (v) negoti~tions  between  MOFE and line ministries  over the programs\nand subprograms;  (vi) integration  of forward  estimates  and basic formulation  of the MTEF; and\n(vii) submission  for  Parliamentary  approval.  These  procedures  have  been  consolidated  in the\nPublic  Expenditure  Management  Operational  Guidelines,  issued  for  use  by  MOFE,  line\nministries,  and other budgetary  bodies.\n10.  To complement  the TSA,  the  Government  has taken  steps  to introduce  a modem  and\nintegrated  treasury  financial  management  information  system,  which  aims  to  integrate  (I)\nelaboration  and control  of budget  accounting  and reporting;  (ii) administration  of the treasury's\nbanking  transactions;  (iii)  execution  of  core  financial  management  functions,  including\nmonitoring  of accounts  payables  and receivables,  asset management,  and inventory  control and\nmanagement  reporting.  To  ensure  effective  control  of  risks,  procedures  and  corresponding\nprotocols  are being developed  for public borrowings  and for investment  management  functions.\n11.  Moving  to  the  implementation  of  entity-level  reforms  as  part  of  the  pilot  program\nsupported  under  GRP  for  bunch  1 agencies,  we  have  catalyzed  ADB  T A  support  to  these\nagencies  to build capacity  through  a number  of workshops  as well as hands-on  training  in the\nformulation  of  their  strategic  business  plans  (SBPs);  preparation  of  financial  statements;\nspecification  of the  outputs  produced  by each  agency  including  description,  quantity,  quality,\nand cost;  preparation  of output-based  forward  estimates;  and formulation  of and adherence  to\nperformance  contracts.\n12.  Ex-post  financial  statements  were  prepared  for all bunch  1 entities  for the years  ending\nDecember  1998 and December  1999, and audited  by NAO. A key step in this process  was the\nshift  in emphasis  in financial  accounting  from  a cash  basis  to accrual  basis.  With  T A support,\nAudit Victoria  (the Auditor  General's  Office  of the State of Victoria,  Australia)  has helped  assess\nthe statements  for all bunch  1 entities  and verified  their quality  as well as that of the underlying\nfinancial  control  systems.  All the  agencies  were  trained  in improved  public  sector  accounting\npolicies,  and familiarized  with the format  and content  of revised financial  statements  and output-\ncosting  methodologies.\n13.  The entire bunch 1 and some of the key bunch 2 agencies and ministries also prepared\nforecast financial statements, in accordance with IAS. A typical forecast financial statement\nincludes a statement of responsibility from the general manager of the agency; a statement of\nthe accounting policies adopted and the forecasting assumptions employed; a balance sheet\ncovering a 3-year planning horizon; a statement of the changes in the net-worth position of the", "Appendi4x   42\nagency over this period; and a statement of cash flows. Formulated in this manner, the medium-\nterm forecasts for assets and liabilities will improve strategic budget planning.\n14.  saps  were also prepared for all bunch 1 agencies  (for 2001-2003 and 2002-2004) and\na rough format for  11 bunch 2 (for 2002-2004) agencies. A typical sap  includes an overall\nvision statement, the strategic priorities, outputs planned for the period, forward appropriation\nestimates and forecast financial statements, and a linkage between the functions of the agency\nand the  overall strategic priorities of the  Government. The saps  provide strategic planning\ndirections and priorities to the budgeta~~~an.d  fully integrate the output requirem.ents and\nthe projections for budget appropriation estimates..\"1n-termso f implementation, however, a key\nconstraint has been the difficulty involved in clearly aefining the output to be produced at the\nentity level, particularly in agencies responsible for policy formulation and execution, where\noutputs  may not be tangible or immediately evident as in the case of public sector entities\nresponsible for production of physical outputs.\nB. Setting the Stage for the Second Phase of Reforms\n15.  Governance reforms are complex, and generally involve a long-drawn process. Having\ndescribed the achievements thus far, let me turn to the forward-looking agenda, which is quite\nchallenging. The Government considers GRP essentially as a pilot program. It has helped to\nenhance  awareness  of the need for  modernizing public sector administration and financial\nmanagement. Its implementation has prepared the groundwork for continuation of reforms.\n16.  The PSMFL is effective from January  1, 2003 and the Government has formulated a\nsound plan to implement the new law in a phased manner in next four years. The  PSMFL\napplies to all levels of government including SOEs and provides an effective framework to\nregulate all relations of responsibility and authority between the government organizations and\nindividuals with regards to the preparation, approval, implementation and reporting of budgets,\noperational  and personnel management in budgetary bodies, and budget control and other\nresponsibility systems. The objective is to integrate strategic planning at all levels with budget\nmaking and execution, decentralize decision making through sound personnel management\npractices and enhanced budget control, accountability and transparency mechanisms.\n17.  The adoption of the legal framework gives a sound footing to move forward. Based on\nthe  lessons  learnt from the Government's  initiatives through  GRP and support from  other\ndonors, let me outline a list of the priority areas for the Government:\n.\nContinuous  capacity  enhancement  at all levels ot the Government,  to ensure that\nthe momentum  is maintained  to implement  PSMFL  in a well-sequenced  manner.\nMore  importantly,  it is essential  that  a \"hand-holding\"  process  is necessary  at\nsome  levels  to ensure  that  the  reform  objectives,  directives  and  measures  are\nclearly  understood.  In this  regard,  the Government  recognizes  that  we  need  to\nadopt  a leaming-by-doing  approach  to reforms,  so that lessons  learnt  along  the\nway  can  be incorporated  into the  PSMFL  implementation  plan,  and  appropriate\nmid-course  corrections  can be allowed.\n. An  integral  part  of such  capacity  building  is support  for  financial  management\nreforms.  Based on the emphasis  on improving  fiscal and financial  transparency  in\nPSMFL,  it  is  of  critical  importance  that  financial  management  systems  are\nupgraded  within  the Government  and the larger  public  sector. A key component\nin this  regard  is to establish  good  internal  control  and  audit  systems  within  the", "Appendix4   43\nline  ministries  and  budgetary  agencies.  Equally  significant  is  the  need  for\nensuring  that  the  financial  and  performance  audit  requirements  outlined  in\nPSMFL are effectively implemented.\n. Fiscal sustainability is of paramount importance. This is the guiding concern\nbehind: (i) the whole govemancer eforma  genda; (ii) the Government'sin  itiatives\nfor national economicd  evelopment;( iii) its formulationo  f the PovertyR  eduction\nStrategy Paper (PRSP),w  hich has been effectivelyc oordinatedw  ith all donors,\nand (iv) the Government's efforts aimed at reforms in sever\"IMy=idtfediens\nunder the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) being implemented\nwith support from the InternationalM  onetaryF und (IMF).  !\n.\nSpecific attention is needed in some areast o help pave the way for medium-a nd\nlong-term fiscal sustainability.W  e have identified 3 critical areas on which this\nGovernmentw  ould like to initiate reforms: (i) alleviating the fiscal pressureso n\nthe budget stemming from the pension system; (ii) the need for reducing the\nmultiplel ayers of administrativec ontrolsa t the lower tiers of governments,a t the\naimag and souml evels;a nd (iii) strengtheninogf  the civils ervice.\n.\nThe present Government has launched significant reforms in the above 3 areas\naimed at enhancing fiscal sustainability. With ADS TA support, the Government\nhas drafted  Social Security  Reform Guidelines, which  incorporate the much-\nneeded reforms to increase retirement ages on a gradual basis.\n.\nThe PSMFL  is our launch-pad  to initiate and accelerate  civil service refonT1s, and\nthe Government has been working closely with IMF World Bank and ADB in this\nI \narea.  Our  goal  is to eventually  have  in place:  (i) sound  wage  and  employment\npolicies,  with  transparency,  equity  and  efficiency  considerations  -  a  key\ningredient  for this is a sound  human  resource  management  infonT1ation system;\nand  (ii) a career-track,  perfonT1ance-oriented  civil service  system  that utilizes tax\npayers'  contributions  in an efficient  manner to deliver  public  services at low costs.\n.\nAdministrative  consolidation  measures  are sensitive  and  complex.  Efforts  have\nbeen  underway  for sometime  to explore  various  avenues  for consolidating  aimag\nand  soum  jurisdictions,  given  the  geographic  spread  of  Mongolia  and  the  high\ncosts  of delivering  services.  However,  this Government  wants  to go through  this\nprocess  with  a  lot  of  care  and  caution.  While  we  recognize  that  some\nfundamental  reforms  may  be  needed,  at  the  same  time,  we  want  to  have\nextensive  stakeholder  consultations  and undertake  in-depth  assessments  on the\neconomic,  social  and political  viability  of such consolidation  measures.\n.\nGovernance  reforms  need  to  be  mainsueamed  in  certain  other  key  areas,\nparticularly  in the  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE)  sector  and  in order to enhance\npublic  confidence  in some  of the  key public  institutions.  On  SOE  reforms,  this\nGovernment  has made significant  advances.  For example,  our efforts  have led to\nsome of the largest  privatizations  in Mongolian  history,  with  the sale of the Trade\nand Development  Bank and Agriculture  Bank of Mongolia.  Yet, it is essential  that\ngovernance  measures  are well  integrated  in SOEs,  to ensure  that their viability\ncan be enhanced  and value  increased.", "44 .\nAppendix4 \nThe Government has undertaken significant efforts with the support of UNDP\nthrough the Good Governancef or Human Security Program.A   key initiative has\nbeen the establishmento f the National Council on Anti-Corruption,w  hich I am\nprivilegedt o chair. The Governmentw  ishes to use this vehicle to launch further\ndeeper reforms in this area, aimed at enhancingt he confidence of the general\npublic in institutions.\n18.  The  Policy  Matrix  that  the  Government  has agreed to for the proposed  GRP-II  outlines\nadequately  these  priority  areas  for public  sector  governance  reforms.  EJections are an integral\npart  of  a well-functioning  deMeGratJe SQCjety. While  this  Government  wants  to  initiate  and\nexpedite  reforms  in certain  critical  areas  that we believe  in, we  also wish  to bear  in mind  the\npolitical  sensitivities  of  some  of  the  reform  measures.  As  I have  outlined  earlier,  a cautious\napproach  needs  to  be  taken  to  address  stakeholder  concerns  on  consolidation  and  other\nforward-looking  measures.  Hence,  this  Government  wants  to  adopt  a  flexible  approach  in\nimplementing  GRP-II.  The  proposed  Program  Cluster  Modality  offers  us  with  such  an\nopportunity  to be specific  about the course  of reforms,  yet remaining  flexible  with regard to exact\nmeasures  in certain  areas.  The  milestones  attached  to the  Policy  Matrix  provide  an outline  of\nthe intended  outcomes  at the end of GRP-II,  in 2009.\n19.  Mr.  President,  finally  let  me  assure  you  of  my  Governmenfs  fullest  commitment  in\nmoving  forward  to  implement  the  second  phase  of  the  governance  reform  roadmap  that\nMongolia and ADB have agreed upon. Specifically  I assure you of our commitment to fulfill all\nt \nthe requirements  and  responsibilities  that  are within  the jurisdiction  of the  Executive  Branch  of\nthe State with regard to: (i) the policy measures  outlined  in Subprogram  1; (ii) measures  needed\nto achieve  the milestones  outlined  for Subprogram  2; (iii) the proposed  technical  assistance  loan\nfor capacity  building  for governance  reforms;  and (iv) overall  GRP-II  implementation.\n20.  Let me thank you and the Asian Development Bank, on behalf of the Govemment of\nMongolia, for your commitment and support for over a decade to develop Mongolia into a more\nvibrant and stronger economy.

Yes  partnership agreement? Yes \n   \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Mongolia: \n \nLack of fiscal responsibility has been a primary factor in large public expenditures and low public sector efficiency. The \nproposed program cluster aims to introduce a number of measures to improve public expenditure management; \nincrease fiscal and financial transparency; and enhance the quality of service delivery in health, education, and social \nwelfare sectors. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification: Good    \n    governance; growth \n \nAnalysis: \n  \n1.  Good governance is an integral part of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy to reduce poverty and is \nessential for efficient management of a developing country's scarce public resources. The Second Phase of the \nGovernance Reform Program (GRP-II) seeks to advance the reform initiatives for public sector management, i.e., \nbring in strategic focus, efficiency and effectiveness, transparency and predictability, accountability, and participation, \nwhich GRP began. GRP-II aims to enhance the capacity of public sector institutions to enable them to generate \nrevenues for public services, and provide a sound regulatory environment to promote public interest, competition, and \noverall governance. The program will directly benefit the poor by improving delivery of social and other services. \nIndirectly in the longer term, the program will help achieve macro stability, improve governance, supplement private \nsector development, and, hence, help boost economic growth and control inflation. GRP-II thus has strong linkages to \npoverty reduction. \n \n2.  The Government remains committed, and is designing a strategy, to reduce poverty on the basis of \nevaluation of current economic and social conditions. Since 2000 Mongolia has been implementing the national \nprogram on good governance for human security (GGHS). Consensus among policymakers and stakeholders is now \nessential. GGHS facilitates policy focus, coherence, and sustainability  for poverty reduction programs by enlisting \nsupport from all stakeholders, state administration, related organizations, media and press, private sector, and civil \nsociety. \n \n3.  The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) states that the Government is committed to formulating \nmacroeconomic policies in the context of a medium-term framework to support rapid, private sector-led growth and \npoverty reduction. The Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility, being implemented with support of the International \nMonetary Fund (IMF), aims to create a stable macroeconomic environment conducive to high private investment and \ngradually raising gross domestic product (GDP) growth to 4\u20136% per annum with a single-digit inflation rate. The \nGovernment's structural reform program will be guided by the need to strengthen the institutions of macroeconomic \nmanagement. In the fiscal area, the highest priority has been given to reforms to improve transparency, accountability, \nand enforcement mechanisms in budget implementation and to ensure more efficient allocations of public expenditure. \nBanking sector reforms will aim to consolidate the shift to a market-oriented system of indirect monetary management, \nstrengthen bank supervision, and accelerate privatization of state-owned banks. Efforts will be stepped up to \nrestructure and privatize nonfinancial public enterprises, establish a sound legal and regulatory framework, and \nmaintain an open trade and investment regime. These measures are expected to enhance opportunities and \nincentives for private participation, including by foreign investors. \n \n4.  Thus, in line with the PRSP, the Government considers the next 10 years as the phase to improve its \nstrategic focus, make delivery of public services more effective and efficient, and the social security system more \nviable;  and  to  establish  better  accountability  and  transparency  mechanisms.  More  effective  and  accountable \ninstitutions will make sound economic policies and raise public confidence, promote investment and economic \ndevelopment, and increase living standards. The Government successfully implemented GRP over 1999\u20132002 with \nADB\u2019s support, and has requested for a follow-up second phase to further the reforms to develop nascent institutions ", "Appendix 9  59 \nADB\u2019s support, and has requested for a follow-up second phase to further the reforms to develop nascent institutions \nand strengthen public sector management to improve efficiency and accountability. GRP-II supports the Government\u2019s \npoverty reduction strategy and is in line with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. The Government is also formulating a \nseries of poverty reduction strategy credits (PRSCs) with World Bank support to help implement the PRSP. \n \n5.  GRP-II is likely to benefit the poor and socially vulnerable through direct as well as indirect channels. Benefits \nwill be enhanced transparency and less public expenditure, which will improve service delivery and access and reduce \nprices. While some measures may have short-term adverse effects, these are likely to be more than compensated for \nby the significant medium- and long-term overall benefits. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \n6.          Stakeholder analysis? Yes. The proposed program cluster forms a part of the 10-year governance reform road \nmap developed under GRP. As part of GRP, Parliament adopted the Public Sector Management and Finance Law \n(PSMFL) following 5 years of extensive stakeholder consultations. The proposal allows for continued significant \nstakeholder involvement. \n \nParticipation strategy? Yes. The program allows for a participatory approach to formulating the specific measures with \nregard to pension reforms and administrative consolidation. \n \nD. Gender and Development \n  \n7.      Strategy to maximize impacts on women: As part of its PRSCs, the World Bank is formulating a gender \ndevelopment strategy in Mongolia. Given that the PRSCs\u2019 focus is on improving public expenditure management, it is \nproposed that the strategy paper be reviewed by ADB, gender-linkages to the overall thrust of PSMFL identified, and \nmeasures formulated as part of subprogram 2 if needed. \n \n8.        Gender plan prepared? No. The proposed measures under the program cluster will not have any differential \neffects between men and women. \n \n \nE.

Poverty Impact Assessment  \n \n1.   Social and Economic Situation  \n \n1.  Poverty is widespread in Mongolia, although trends have been mixed. Poverty increased \nduring the last decade of transition as a result of sudden withdrawal from the socialist system in \nthe  face  of  weak  alternative  public  institutions  and  policies  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  the \ntransition. As economic growth declined, public access to basic education, health services, and \nsocial conditions deteriorated, particularly in early part of the transition. The Government thus \nlaunched reforms such as trade and price liberalization, a floating exchange rate, privatization of \npublic sector assets, and tight monetary and fiscal policies. Growth in gross domestic product \n(GDP) recovered to 2.3% in 1994 and has remained positive since then. Hyperinflation declined \nto 66.3% in 1994, averaged 27 percent in 1995\u20131999 and further declined to 8.1 percent by \n2000. Unemployment has also gradually decreased since 1996. \n \n2.  The 1998 living standards measurement survey showed that about 36 percent of the \nMongolian population was poor. While poverty appeared to have stabilized over 1995-2000, the \ndepth and severity of poverty increased and inequality worsened. Various surveys indicated \nconcentration of poverty in four population categories: single-parent households with many \nchildren; households with less than 100  heads of livestock; the uneducated; and vulnerable \ngroups (elderly, disabled, street children, and orphans). The survey confirms a direct correlation \nbetween poverty and unemployment, and indicates that cost for education and health services \nis a heavy burden on the poor. Migration to urban areas has been substantial since 1996, \nconcentrating poverty in urban areas. \n \n3.  The economy has slowed down in recent years due to several reasons. Several external \nfactors adversely affected the economy: harsh weather (dzuds, severe winters followed by dry \nsummers); onslaught of the foot-and-mouth disease;1 and sharp fall in prices of main export \nearners (copper, cashmere, and gold). Acute shortage of management skills has inhibited \nprivate sector development. Privatization caused a large number of plant closures, job losses, \nand disruptions in production and supply, resulting in revenue shortfalls, which, combined with \ninefficient and rising public expenditures, led to large reinforcing deficits and deteriorating public \nservice delivery. The recent economic slowdown in 2000-01 appears to have exacerbated \npoverty.  \n \n4.  In summary, while Mongolia has made substantial progress in the transition to a market \neconomy over the last 10 years, serious challenges remain to be overcome to raise living \nstandards  and  reduce  poverty.  The  economy  has  recorded  a  positive  growth  for  seven \nconsecutive years, and inflation has been brought down to single digits. The economy is now \nmore open, citizens have the right and opportunity to set and pursue their economic goals, and \na regulatory base for a free and competitive environment for private enterprise has been \ncreated. Yet, the country\u2019s economic base is narrow and highly vulnerable to external shocks. \nFinancial intermediation remains fragile. Given the relatively small market, the Government and \nstate-owned  enterprises  wield  a  lot  of  influence.  These  factors  weaken  private  sector \nconfidence, especially of foreign investors. The public sector is not well managed, which, \ncombined with excessive government controls, has led to deteriorating access and quality of \nbasic  services,  such  as  education,  health,  etc.  Reforms  in  governance  and  public  sector \nmanagement are thus the key to development and poverty reduction. \n \n                                                 \n1  Animal husbandry is the leading industry, and the disease killed a large number of cattle in the last couple of years. ", "Appendix 9  61 \n2.   Policy Actions and their Impact on Poverty and Other Social Dimensions \n \n5.  The first component of the Second Phase of the Governance Reform Program (GRP-\nII)\u2014to  formulate  a  sound  implementation  framework  to  guide  public  sector  governance \nreforms\u2014seeks  to  widen  and  deepen  the  reforms  initiated  as  part  of  the  Public  Sector \nManagement and Finance Law (PSMFL) to the whole Government. These reforms relate to \nrevamping  planning,  budget,  and  expenditures;  introducing  a  performance  management \nsystem; adopting accounting and auditing systems in line with international standards; and \nbringing in more transparent reporting systems. The framework proposes to adopt PSMFL-\nrelated guidelines and legislation, launch process-related capacity-building initiatives, institute \nexpenditure control measures, and set up accountable institutional structures. These reforms \nhave obvious links to good governance and poverty reduction and will directly benefit the poor \nby giving them improved access to quality public services. Indirect long-term benefits are also \nsignificant. Transparent use of public funds and effective delivery of key services will improve \npublic  participation,  boost  private  sector  development,  accelerate  economic  growth,  and \nincrease jobs. Good growth and employment prospects will have a favorable impact on public \nsector finances and help reinforce growth, control inflation, and reduce poverty (Table 1).  \n \n6.  Other than the impacts identified below, GRP-II is not likely to have any other social \nimpact, including on indigenous people or any other vulnerable groups. \n \nTable A9.1: Poverty Impact of Public Sector Governance Reforms \n \nType of Effect \nChannel   Direct Effect  Indirect Effect  Macro Effect  Effect on the \nNonpoor \nLabor  In general,  If public sector  Transparent use of  Efficiency will be \nimprovements in  efficiency  public funds to  improved. \nadministrative  translates into  deliver key services \nprocesses will make  wage increases,  will improve public \npublic sector human  it may encourage  participation, boost \nresources more  migration to cities  private sector \nefficient.  and raise private  development, and \nRationalization of  sector wages,  lead to better \nemployment is likely in  thereby adding to  economic growth \nsome entities following  urban  and more jobs. \na close scrutiny of  unemployment \nexpenditures under  and social \nthe newly developed  security budgets \nstrategic business  in the short term. \nplans, output \ncontracts, and \nperformance \nmanagement \nagreements.

The second component to improve fiscal sustainability has two aims. The first is to make \nthe social security system more sustainable. Overall social security payments, particularly \npensions, have been rising fast because of early retirements and generous benefits.

GRP-II aims to consolidate central and local administration to streamline public sector \nadministration and strengthen resource management. Public expenditures have risen rapidly \ndue to administrative proliferation at different government levels. The proposed consolidation \nmeasures under GRP-II aim to achieve economies of scale and strengthen public sector \nresource management.
