In support of gender and development (GAD) in Cambodia, the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  provided  technical  assistance1  (TA)  to  help  formulate  the  National  Policy  for \nWomen (issued in 1996) and establish the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs (in 1998, the ministry \nwas expanded to include veterans\u2019 affairs and was renamed the Ministry of Women\u2019s and \nVeterans\u2019  Affairs  [MOWVA]  in  1999).  MOWVA  plays  a  catalytic  role  within  the  Royal \nGovernment of Cambodia (the Government) to mainstream gender in the mandates, policies, \nand programs of line ministries, local governments, public institutions, civil society, and private \nsector.  MOWVA  also  collaborates  with  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  through  the \nWomen\u2019s Forum and coordinates all external assistance for GAD. \n \n2.  A second TA2 provided capacity-building support to enable MOWVA to influence and \nguide the line ministries and lower level administration units to mainstream gender concerns. \nImplementation of the TA commenced in May 2000 and was completed in October 2001. The \nTA completion report rates the activity successful. The Government requested a follow-up TA to \nbring the newly acquired expertise to the grassroots level in the rural areas and initiate activities \nfor the economic empowerment of women. The current TA is included in ADB\u2019s country strategy \nand program (CSP) for 2002. It supports poverty reduction interventions for disadvantaged \nwomen, one of the priorities for cooperation between the Government and ADB as formalized in \nthe poverty reduction partnership agreement signed on 29 July 2002. A TA fact-finding mission \nvisited Cambodia in March 2002 and reached an understanding with the Government on the \nobjectives, scope, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, and consulting services for the \nTA.3 The logical framework for the TA is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Cambodia\u2019s gross domestic product per capita is estimated at only 257 (US) dollars in \n2000,  among  the  lowest  in  the  region.  The  incidence  of  poverty  is  high,  with  36.1%  of \nhouseholds living below the poverty line. Cambodia has one of the highest female labor force \nparticipation rates in the region, at 73.5% of women over the age of 15 years. Women comprise \n54% of skilled workers in agriculture, 75% of the primary labor force in wholesale and retail, and \n67% of the labor force in manufacturing. The adult literacy rate is 61% (vs. 83% for males), and \nonly 12% of women over 25 years have more than a primary school education. The total fertility \nrate at 4.1 and maternal mortality ratio at 473 per 100,000 live births (2000) are the highest in \nthe region. Cambodia has become a sending, receiving, and transit country for trafficking of \nwomen and children. The Second Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2001-2005, estimates that \n88,000 Cambodian women are in Thailand, with 40\u201360% of sex workers saying they were \nforced or tricked into the business. As of 2000, 31% of commercial sex workers and 2.3% of \nwomen attending antenatal clinics were infected with HIV/AIDS.4 Poverty, social upheaval, \nunderdeveloped legal infrastructure, and weak law enforcement contribute to the exploitation of \nwomen. \n \n4.  While MOWVA has improved its technical and managerial capacity considerably over \nrecent years, much is still to be desired to fortify its role as advocate, catalyst, and facilitator of \ngender mainstreaming and awareness of gender concerns. Staff in MOWVA\u2019s central offices \nhave been upgraded, but staff at the provincial, district, and commune levels, who number over \n1,000 and comprise the bulk of the ministry\u2019s human resources, have gone largely untrained. \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 1994.

", "2   \nMOWVA\u2019s middle management is inadequate. MOWVA does not have adequate resources to \nsupport gender focal points in the line ministries, and coordination is still unsatisfactory and \nineffective.  Findings  in  many  impact  evaluation  studies  of  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Evaluation \nDepartment show that to ensure sustained development, a series of overlapping projects with \nconsistent core objectives, aiming over a decade or more, is needed to make an impact on key \nindicators while strengthening government management capacity. \n \n5.  The participating line ministries need strengthened capacity to (i) gather information and \nanalyze  gender  concerns  in  employment  directed  at  influencing  policy  formulation  and \nintegration of gender concerns, especially as they affect the poor into sector policies and \nprograms; (ii) identify and respond to gender concerns in their areas of responsibility; and (iii) \nestablish systems and procedures within the ministry for sectorwide management of women\u2019s \neconomic  empowerment  activities.  The  participating  line  ministries  are  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture, Fisheries and Forestry; Ministry of Commerce; Ministry of Education, Youth and \nSports (MOEYS); Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy; Ministry of Rural Development; and \nMinistry of Social Affairs, Labor, Vocational Training and Youth Rehabilitation (MOSALVY). All \nare directly involved in employment generation. A memorandum of understanding will be drawn \nup between MOWVA and these line ministries for the TA. \n \n6.  Close cooperation and coordination among aid agencies and executing agencies of \nprojects and programs will be critical. Several capacity building projects with MOWVA are \nongoing. Notable among these are the International Labor Organization (ILO) and Japan Asian \nRegional  Project,  the  Expansion  of  Employment  Opportunities  for  Women  (EEOW);  the \nPartnership for Gender Equity (formerly Partnership for Building Together) financed by the \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the Government of the Netherlands; \nSEILA5 financed by UNDP, Department for International Development (United Kingdom), and \nSwedish  International  Development  Cooperating  Agency;  and  the  Integrated  Economic \nEmpowerment, Entrepreneurship and Employment for Women (NEEEW) in Cambodia assisted \nby Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ). The TA will build on the \nachievements  of  these  projects  and  complement  the  gender  training  being  conducted  for \nMOWVA with training for staff in the participating line ministries.  \n \n7.  The Government has well-defined policy and strategic plans in (i) the National Policy for \nWomen (1996); Neary Rattanak, \u201cWomen are Precious Gems\u201d (1999), and in the Second Socio-\nEconomic  Development  Plan  (2001\u20132005).  Capacity  building  must  be  considered  within \nMOWVA  and  line  ministries  must  be  initiated  into  mainstreaming  gender  and  women \nempowerment into their activities. The TA is the first phase of a recommended program to \naddress the economic empowerment of women in Cambodia. The second phase will be the \napplication of the knowledge built in the line ministries to actual programs for employment \npromotion among women on a pilot scheme.  \n \n8.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s CSP update (2003-2005). The TA is necessary and \ntimely  and  will  contribute  to  the  overall  goal  of  reducing  poverty  through  the  economic \nempowerment of women, especially the poor, widows, single parents, migrants, working women \nand those at risk.  \n \n9.  In the design of the TA, a number of issues has been considered: (i) sociocultural \nconstraints that continue to subordinate women, manifested in their limited occupational choices \nand in the gender gap in literacy and levels of educational attainment; (ii) very low levels of \nliteracy in rural areas, so that programs directed at expanding employment opportunities for \nwomen should include training in functional literacy; (iii) growing pressures on agriculture that \n                                                 \n5\n   Seila is the khmer word for \u201cfoundation stone\u201d. ", "  3\nare increasing pressure on poor rural families to seek alternative sources of livelihood, pointing \nto  the  need  for  more  emphasis  on  developing  and  strengthening  alternative  livelihood \nopportunities  in  rural  areas  to  absorb  the  rapidly  growing  labor  force;  (iv)  the  need  for \nstrengthening opportunities in secondary occupations for the rural work force; (v) retail trade, \nthe  most  important  industry  for  women  outside  of  agriculture,  requires  addressing  gender \nconcerns in the market place; and (vi) increased mobility that is changing the nature of the \nfamily unit and contributing to high-risk behavior and increased vulnerability to exploitation.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  In support of the Government\u2019s goal of reducing poverty, the goal of the TA is to \ncontribute to the economic empowerment of disadvantaged women in the rural areas, especially \nthe poor, widows, single parents, working women, and migrants. The TA will strengthen the \ncapacity of MOWVA to manage its mandate of gender mainstreaming at the provincial and \ncommune  levels  (through  the  provincial  departments  of  women\u2019s  and  veterans\u2019  affairs \n[PDWVA]). It will also strengthen the capacity of the six participating line ministries to generally \nmanage gender mainstreaming and activities in their sectors, and specifically to implement \nemployment generation schemes under the TA. It will build on the achievements of the previous \nTA and align capacity-building efforts along the decentralized system6 being implemented. It will \ncover to the extent possible, organizations and agencies that are involved in such work, e.g., the \nCambodian Union Federation, Employers\u2019 Federation, Cambodian National Council for Women, \nand NGOs.  \n \n11.  Key outputs will include (i) a situation analysis of the existing management system and \ncapacity to mainstream gender at the provincial offices of MOWVA and at the six line ministries; \n(ii) action plans for supporting strategic planning, monitoring, and evaluation; (iii) a labor market \ninformation  database;  (iv)  training  materials  on  entrepreneurship  development  and \nmicroenterprise  development;  (v)  market  research  methodologies  and  tools;  (vi)  strategic \nframework for micro and small enterprise development and support; and (vii) ministry strategies \nin support of economic empowerment of women.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will cover geographical areas and activities in 8 provinces not already covered \nby projects of other aid agencies. Activities will be centered in the line ministries (central and \nprovincial/commune levels) with oversight by MOWVA and the consultants. The TA will have \nthree major components: (i) strengthening capacity in advocacy for employment promotion in \nMOWVA  and  the  six  line  ministries  through  training;  (ii)  development  of  approaches  and \nmaterials  for  strengthening  women\u2019s  employment  opportunities  (labor  market  information, \nentrepreneurship  development  and  microenterprise  management,  training  programs,  and \nproduct marketing); and, (iii) strengthening capacity in policy formulation and networking (micro \nand small enterprise development, models and best practices, and networking).  \n \n13.  Advocacy  for  Economic  Empowerment  of  Women.  Activities  will  include \n(i) information  and  data  gathering  about  and  analyses  of  gender  concerns  in  employment, \ndirected at influencing policy formulation and integration of gender concerns into national and \nsectoral policies and programs; (ii) identification of gender-specific concerns in employment \npromotion for women through the PDWVAs and local governments in the selected provinces; \n                                                 \n6   A project in support of the Government\u2019s decentralization, the Commune Council Development Project (formerly \nthe Decentralization Support Program), in the amount of $17 million, is in the Cambodia CSPU (2003-2005). ", "4   \nand (iii) strengthening of systems and procedures within MOWVA for sectorwide management \nof women\u2019s economic empowerment activities, such as aid coordination, external aid sourcing, \nand  interministerial  networking;  work  planning,  monitoring,  evaluation,  and  feedback;  and \nimproving communication (English), management, and computing skills. \n \n14.  Development of Approaches and Materials. Activities include (i) establishment of a \ndatabase for labor market information in collaboration with the National Institute of Statistics,  \nwith particular emphasis on the informal sector: data are to be segregated by gender, age, \neducational qualification, rural-urban setting, and province; (ii) development of methodologies \nand tools for identifying local products with market potential, and analyzing opportunities and \nconstraints to developing these products from a gender perspective; (iii) development and field-\ntesting  of  teaching  and  learning  materials  on  women  entrepreneurship  development  and \nmicroenterprise management in collaboration with relevant line ministries and aid agencies; and \n(iv) support for development and testing of microenterprise and entrepreneurial training, training \nof trainers, employment services, and job counseling (in cooperation with MOEYS, MOSALVY, \nand women in development centers).  \n \n15.  Policy Formulation and Networking. Activities include (i) formulating the micro and \nsmall  enterprise  development7  framework  for  MOWVA\u2019s  strategic  plan;  (ii)  supporting  the \nestablishment  of  a  framework  and  identifying  models  and  best  practices  to  support  the \nimplementation of the National Policy for Women across the line ministries; (iii) assisting line \nministries to formulate their strategies to support the economic empowerment of women; and \n(iv) developing networks with other ministries, aid agencies, NGOs, and other projects, among \nprovinces and with other countries. \n \n16.  The anticipated outcomes from the TA will include (i) strengthened MOWVA\u2019s capacity \nas  advocate,  catalyst,  and  facilitator  of  gender  mainstreaming  and  awareness  of  gender \nconcerns among the line ministries, including planning, implementation, monitoring, evaluation, \nand feedback; (ii) improved MOWVA aid coordination, external aid sourcing, and interministerial \nnetworking; (iii) strengthened interdepartmental coordination mechanisms between MOWVA \nand PDWVAs; (iv) strengthened capacity of the line ministries to formulate policy and integrate  \ngender concerns into their sector policies and programs; and (v) improved capability of MOWVA \nand line ministries at provincial, district, commune, and institutional levels for program planning, \nmonitoring, and reporting, including technical and financial aspects. \n \n17.  For the TA, MOWVA must manage (i) a multiplicity of government implementing agencies \n(PDWVAs),  other  ministries  and  their  provincial  departments;  and  (ii)  complex  coordinating \nrequirements between central and local governments, and with NGOs, projects/programs of aid \nagencies. ADB experience shows that such complex management requirements have resulted in \nproblems in the sequencing and synchronizing activities and have strained interoffice relations. \nThus, close supervision and monitoring of activities will be required. There is also a risk that \nadequate social capital may not be built. Key stakeholders, and their interests and power, needs \nand  demands,  and  willingness  to  participate  must  be  identified.  The  local  organizational \ncapacity must be built through participatory processes to enhance people\u2019s ability to work \ntogether, trust each other, mobilize resources, resolve conflicts, and network. Stakeholders \nmust be provided with opportunities to make choices and options on the type of projects they \nwant and given the authority to manage such projects. \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $470,000 equivalent, comprising $300,000 in \n                                                 \n7   Linkages will be made with the proposed SME Sector Development Project (in the CSPU for a loan of $15 million \nin 2004), a project preparatory TA for $500,000 in 2003, and an advisory TA for $500,000 in 2004. ", "  5\nforeign exchange and $170,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $400,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost, and $100,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis, from the Poverty \nReduction Cooperation Fund. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency \ncost, equivalent to $70,000, through the provision of counterpart staff and training, workshops, \nadministrative and support services, and office accommodation. The Government assured ADB \nof the availability of counterpart services, facilities, and funds. The detailed cost estimates and \nproposed financing arrangements are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  MOWVA will be the Executing Agency and will coordinate activities closely with the six \nline ministries, agencies, and NGOs. The undersecretary of state will be the TA director and will \nhave overall responsibility for the TA. Quarterly and annual reports summarizing the outcome of \nTA  activities  will  be  prepared.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  during  18  months  in  close \ncoordination and collaboration with ILO (EEOW), NEEEW, UNDP\u2019s Partnership for Gender \nEquity and SEILA, and GAD projects of other aid agencies. The TA will work in collaboration \nwith  the  project  steering  committee  already  set  up  for  EEOW.  The  steering  committee  is \ncomprised  of  11  full  members  and  11  back-up  members  representing  (i)  MOWVA;  (ii) \nMOSALVY; (iii) MOEYS; (iv) Ministries of Industry, Mining and Energy; (v) Ministry of Rural \nDevelopment; (vi) Ministry of Commerce; (vii) Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery; (viii) \nthe  Cambodian  Union  Federation;  and  (ix)  the  Employers\u2019  Federation.  The  committee  will \nestablish guidelines for the training and seminar programs and will meet every 6 months to \nreview progress and resolve issues. \n20.  The  TA  will  require  a  total  of  30  person-months  of  consulting  services,  including \n12 person-months for an international consultant (institution development and management \nexpert), and 18 person-months for a domestic consultant (human resource development and \ntraining  expert).  The  services  will  be  spread  over  the  project  implementation  period  of \n18 months  starting  in  November  2002  and  ending  in  April  2004.  The  two  experts  will  be \nengaged on an individual basis by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants.  Office  equipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n21.  The Government will provide a suitably qualified counterpart team of six staff to work \nwith the consultants, as well as office accommodation for the project management team. Under \nthe supervision of MOWVA, the team will implement the planned activities and outputs. The \nconsultants will facilitate the functioning of the team, and provide intensive, on-the-job capacity \nbuilding support. The consultants will also help develop training programs and conduct training \nworkshops to be organized in accordance with arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to the Government \nof Cambodia to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for the \npurpose of Sustainable Employment Promotion for Poor Women, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board.
