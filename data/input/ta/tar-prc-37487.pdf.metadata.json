The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (the PRC) requested technical \nassistance  (TA)  to  prepare  the  proposed  Xi'an-Zhengzhou  Railway  Project  for  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  financing.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  the  project  area in \nFebruary-March  2004,  carried  out  an  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  and  a  rapid \nenvironmental  assessment,  and  discussed  technical  and  socioeconomic  issues  with \nrepresentatives  of  the  Government,  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR),  and  provincial  and  local \ngovernments. This paper is based on the understanding reached by the Government and the \nMission on the objectives, scope, terms of reference, cost estimates and financing plan, and \nimplementation arrangements for the TA. The TA is included in ADB's country assistance \nprogram for 2004.1 \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  From  1978,  when  economic  reforms  were  introduced,  through  to  2002,  the  PRC \nexperienced  sustained  rapid  economic  growth.  PRC's  exceptional  economic  performance \ncontinued in 2003 with economic growth rates of 9.1%. Rapid economic growth resulted in a \nrapid increase in demand for transportation. The annual growth of passenger transport was \n9.2% and freight transport grew at 7.1% during the 1978-2002 period. In 2002, road traffic \naccounted for 55.3% of total passenger-kilometers (km) followed by railways with 35.2%, civil \naviation with 8.9%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.6%. The modal split for freight ton-\nkm was 54.4% for coastal and inland waterways, 30.7% for railways, 13.4% for roads, 1.4% for \npipelines, and 0.1% for civil aviation.  \n \n3.  Rapid economic growth has led to a high demand for railway transportation, which is the \nprimary mode of transport for long distance and bulk transport.  Between 1978 and 2002, \nrailway freight grew from  535 billion ton-km to 1,552 billion ton-km, equivalent to an annual \ngrowth rate of 4.5%; while passenger traffic grew at 6.5% annually, increasing from 109 billion \npassenger-km  to  497  billion  passenger-km.  At  the  end  of  2003,  PRC\u2019s  railway  system \ncomprised  73,000  route-km.  Despite  such  growth  rates,  the  railway  capacity  lags  behind \ndemand, and bottlenecks in the railway system pose a major constraint to efficient economic \ngrowth in the PRC. Given the railway's important role, the Government adopted an aggressive \nplan to improve the railways and planned network development to remove these bottlenecks.  \n \n4.  The Government\u2019s policy on railway development is focused on (i) removing constraints \nand expanding the system, (ii) encouraging joint venture with local railways to promote the \ndevelopment of local economies, (iii) improving efficiency by using new technology and modern \nmanagement  tools  in  planning  and  operation,  (iv)  reducing  operating  subsidies  through \nappropriate pricing and commercialization of services, (v) instituting institutional and structural \nreforms to increase MOR\u2019s autonomy and accountability, and (vi) encouraging nongovernment \ninvestment in infrastructure and related services.  \n \n5.  The  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  identifies  transportation,  including  railway \ndevelopment, as a priority. The Plan envisages (i) constructing 6,000 km of new lines to provide \naccess to unserved areas, with the network length reaching a total of 75,000 route-km by 2005; \n(ii) constructing 3,000 km  of double lines and electrifying 5,000 km of key lines to increase \ncapacity; and (iii) increasing operating speeds on 5,000 km, with high speed on the total length \nof 15,000 km. The Plan envisages a total investment of CNY350 billion, including CNY270 \nbillion for capital construction and CNY80 billion for rolling stock acquisition for the railway \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) on 13 January 2004. ", "2 \nsector. During 2003\u20132007, the investments for capital construction for the railway station are \nexpected  to  reach  CNY450  billion.  In  2004,  the  State  Council  approved  a  new  railway \ndevelopment plan, which seeks to expand the railway network from the present 73,000 km to \n100,000 km by 2020 and identifies the need to have separate passenger and freight-dedicated \nlines on the busy trunk routes. The route length of the passenger-dedicated network will reach \n5,000 km by 2010 and 12,000 km by 2020. Increasing train speed is identified as a major goal. \nTrain speed will be raised to over 200 km per hour from the present 120 km per hour on the \ntrunk network by 2020. Development of railways will receive priority in unserved areas and \nregions that have remained less developed, and the route network length will reach 16,000 km \nin the western region of the PRC by 2020. \n \n6.  Japan is the major source of external financing in the PRC railway sector, followed by \nthe World Bank and ADB. Since 1979, Japan has provided about  Y558 billion for 15 railway \nprojects to expand rail transportation capacity. Since 1984, the World Bank has provided nine \nloans totaling over $2.2 billion for (i) eight national railway projects to expand railway capacity \non  high-priority  corridors,  modernize  system-wide  technology,  and  strengthen  institutional \ncapabilities; and (ii) one local railway project. ADB has focused on the development of railways \nin less developed inland provinces to promote growth and reduce poverty. ADB has provided 11 \nloans totaling $2.06 billion to finance the construction of about 1,737 km of provincial railways \noperated by joint ventures with MOR, and 4,138 km of new railway lines under four national \nrailway projects. \n \n7.  ADB 's operational strategy in the PRC focuses on (i) expanding the railway system in \nunserved less developed and poor areas, (ii) modernizing and increasing the capacity on key \nroutes of the national railway system to improve transport efficiency, (iii) commercializing railway \noperations to sustain efficient operations, and (iv) increasing railway competitiveness in the \ntransport sector through restructuring and by policy reform. The strategy will continue to focus \non railways development in underserved areas in poor interior provinces to link lower income \nregions with growth centers so as to facilitate pro-poor growth, a prerequisite to reducing \npoverty. The policy issues addressed in the railway sector include corporatization, marketing \nand business development, and tariff setting with improved cost recovery. ADB has enhanced \npolicy dialogue with MOR and is providing technical assistance support for policy reforms to \nMOR.2 This consultation will continue to further the reforms in the sector.  \n \n8.  The proposed project envisages the construction of 455 km of double-track Class I \npassenger-dedicated electrified railway line suitable for speeds of over 200 km per hour and of \n10 new railway stations. The railway will traverse 16 counties of Henan and Shaanxi provinces \nand is the middle segment of the passenger-dedicated Xuzhou-Lanzhou (east-west) main trunk \nline starting from Zhengzhou city in the east, running westward through the cities of Luoyang, \nSanmenxia, and Weinan and reaching its west end at Xi\u2019an in  northwest PRC. The project \nimpact area includes 16 counties and cities (including 5 poverty counties) with a total population \nof about 31.7 million in Luoyang, Sanmenxia, Xi\u2019an, Weinan and Zhengzhou. About 2.6 million \npeople live on incomes below the national or provincial poverty line. The total rural population \nexceeds 14 million and there are over 3,300 poverty villages in the project impact area. A large \nnumber of the population in Luoyang, Sanmenxia, Weinan, and Xian that do not have access to \nhighways, electricity, telephones and good drinking water; 890 villages do not have highway \naccess; 241 villages do not have electricity; 373 villages do not have telephones; and 3,299 \nvillages do not have access to good drinking water. The ensuing project will directly benefit a \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2004.

It is projected to create indirect benefits in a much larger area, including most \ncities, counties, townships, and villages of Luoyang, Sanmaxian, Weinan, Xi\u2019an and Zhengzhou, \nbecause the proposed railway will serve as link to the tourist areas, and allow transport of the \nagricultural and local products of the region.  \n \n9.  The  rationale  for  the  project  reflects  (i)  railway  network  development;  (ii)  capacity \nenhancement; (iii) meeting the needs of the new railway development plan, and the western \nregion development strategy, and (iv) promoting pro-poor economic growth along the line and in \nthe region, thereby reducing poverty. The proposed alignment for the Xi\u2019an-Zhengzhou Railway \nis 50 km shorter than the existing Longhai railway line. The proposed railway line will traverse \nHenan and Shaanxi  provinces and connect with Beijing-Guangzhou, Shanghai-Xuzhou and \nBeijing-Wuhan main lines on the east and Xi\u2019an-Baoji-Lanzhou, Xi\u2019an-Baoji-Chengdu, Xi\u2019an-\nAnkang, and Xi\u2019an-Yan\u2019an3 main lines on the west.  The proposed line  extends eastward to \nShanghai and Xuzhou, connecting itself with Jing-Jiu4 and Jing-Hu routes; and westward to \nBaoji and Lanzhou, connecting with the Jing-Lan routes and Lan-Xin line. This is the main east-\nwest corridor linking Beijing, Shanghai, other major cities and ports in the east, and Xi\u2019an, Baoji, \nLanzhou, Urumqi, Chengdu, Chongqing in the west.  \n \n10.  The current capacity on the existing line is fully used. In 2002, with a design capacity of \n46 million tons of freight and 52 pairs of passenger trains per day, 67 million tons of freight and \n49 pairs of passenger trains were operated. By the year 2020 and 2030, transportation capacity \nis expected to increase to 88.5 million tons and 143 pairs of passenger trains, and 97.1 million \ntons of freight and 198 pairs of passenger trains, respectively. Presently both freight and \npassengers are transported on the same line. This practice limits speed and restricts the flow of \ntraffic. MOR\u2019s railway development plan proposes separating freight and passenger movement \non the highly trafficked trunk routes by developing separate networks for moving passengers \nand cargo and increasing speed. The ensuing Project is the first of the eight passenger-\ndedicated railway lines that will use advanced technology and equipment and have substantial \nmanagerial and financial autonomy, including tariffs higher than those of the national network.  \n \n11.  The project area has abundant natural reserves of coal, zinc, and other nonferrous \nmaterials; and a large manufacturing industry and tourist sites. The project will be the main \npassenger transportation link between the prosperous east-west and the poorer western region. \nThe proposed railway will pass through an alignment that is largely in a mountainous area and \nhas remained cut off from mainstream development due to lack of transportation and remote \nlocation. The people living in the site, particularly the remote mountainous areas have remained \nlargely poor. Many leave their towns and villages to find jobs. Economic growth necessary to \nreduce rural poverty has not been achieved because of inadequate transport. The provincial \nand local governments, and people living in the project area see the railway as a key investment \nnecessary to create employment and income-generating activities for the people in the region \nand as a necessary prerequisite to reduce poverty.  \n \n12.  The project will help develop the railroad network and enhance economic growth. The \nproject is included in MOR\u2019s updated Tenth Five-Year Plan as well as the railway development \nplan and  will support the Government\u2019s western region development strategy. The proposed \nrailway will facilitate economic development and integration of the poor western region and is \nexpected  to  stimulate  industrial  and  natural  resources  development,  tourism,  and  related \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1994.

The railway will increase local people\u2019s access to market and social services and \ngive them an opportunity to improve their standard of living.  Completed and ongoing ADB-\nfinanced railway projects  show that such projects create jobs in construction, loading and \nunloading operations, other income-generating activities such as material and food supply, and \nsmall  services  around  the  construction  sites.5  The  lower  transportation  costs  after  project \ncompletion will make goods and services available at more economic prices to the people living \nin the area, including the poor, and provide them opportunities to sell their produce to broader \nmarkets. The railway will offer them more affordable, reliable, and punctual transport than is \ncurrently available.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country operational strategy and will \nsupport the Government\u2019s strategic policy objective of greater developmental emphasis on poor \ninterior and underserved areas of the PRC by improving transportation linkage with growth \ncenters. \n \n13.  The  project  envisages  the  construction  of  a  passenger-dedicated railway line with \nsubgrades, bridges, and tunnels. Because of the topography along the Xi\u2019an-Zhengzhou railway \nroute, tunnels and bridges will comprise 50% of the route length. \n \n14.  The project is a national project and will be implemented by MOR. A feasibility study is \nbeing prepared with cost estimates that reflect the current prices of materials and construction \nand traffic forecasts. MOR advised ADB that the project proposal is expected to be approved by \nthe  National  Development  Reforms  Commission  by  May  2004.  The  feasibility  study,  the \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA), and the draft resettlement plan will be submitted to \nADB at the same time. The local governments of Luoyang, Sanmexian, Weinan, Xi\u2019an and \nZhengzhou  prefectures  confirmed  that  all  the  counties  affected  have  implemented  many \nprojects involving resettlement. Resettlement under the project will be implemented as per the \nnational laws and provincial regulations, and ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy. \n                                                 \n5  In the ADB-financed Daxian-Waxian Railway Project, the average net income along the proposed alignment of the \nrailway increased by 25% in real terms during the construction period. The average real increase in Chongqing \nmunicipality for the same period was approximately 10%. Education is often the first spending priority for families. \nBecause of an improved cash position, some poor people are reportedly no longer indebted for school tuition for \nthe next generation.

Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $650,000 equivalent, comprising of $372,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $278,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs  (Appendix  3).  The \nGovernment has requested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign \nexchange cost and $128,000 equivalent of local currency costs. ADB will finance the TA on a \ngrant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  MOR  will  provide  the  remaining  $150,000 \nequivalent in local currency cost for the counterpart staff, office facilities, local communications, \nand support services. The Government and MOR were advised that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to financing any ensuing project. ", "6 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The TA will require about 39 person-months of consulting services (15 international and \nabout 24 domestic) spread over 5 months, including fieldwork.  For implementing the TA, a \nteam of international consultants assisted by domestic consultants will be selected and engaged \nin accordance with ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. A consulting firm will be \nselected and engaged following the quality and cost-based selection method and simplified \ntechnical  proposals  will  be  required.  The  international  consultants  will  have  expertise  in \ntransport  economics  and  traffic  forecasting,  financial  analysis  and  financial  management, \nrailway engineering and operation, environmental sciences, institution building, and resettlement \nand social and poverty analysis. Expertise required from domestic consultants will be in the \nfields of transport economics, railway engineering and operation, environmental engineering, \nresettlement and socioeconomics.

Review the \ndemand for transport of goods by the railway based on origin-destination data, \nand traffic forecast by commodity. Review the demand for passenger traffic \nbased on an origin and destination survey. Develop a passenger profile for the \nrailway. Subdivide the forecast of freight and passengers into categories to show \nthe  source  of  the  traffic  so  as  to  enable  the  benefits  of  the  railway  to  be \nestimated. Subdivide the forecast into traffic diverted from road, traffic diverted \nfrom other modes, and generated traffic. The traffic forecast should cover 25 \nyears from the start of project operation, under two scenarios (a) a base-case \nscenario, and (b) a low scenario that considers the experience gained and \nlessons learned with similar projects in the past, in which the actual traffic was \nless  than  the  forecasts  due  to  delays  in  implementing  the  envisaged \ndevelopmental projects that were expected to provide traffic for the project, as \nwell as any other reasons. \n(iv)  Identify  all  project  costs  and  benefits,  comparing  with-  and  without-project \nsituations.  Estimate the economic internal rate of return and net present value \non the basis of nonincremental and incremental economic benefits and economic \ncosts (including economic capital, operation, and maintenance costs) in constant \neconomic prices. In economic analysis, evaluate the environmental aspects, and \nanalyse poverty reduction benefits envisaged under the project. During project \noperation, include in the economic analysis the effects on poverty reduction of \naffordable goods due to cheaper rail transportation, increased prices of goods \nreceived by rural producers at the markets in urban areas, and less costly \npersonal travel.  Also include the incremental tourism benefits related to the \nproject. \n(v)  Undertake a sensitivity analysis to assess the effects of adverse changes in key \nassumptions that underline the economic analysis, including, but not limited to, \nproject  costs,  traffic,  and  implementation  delay.    Express  the  results  as  a \nsensitivity indicator and a switching value. If the project is sensitive to the value \nof  a  key  variable,  recommend  measures  to  minimize  the  risk.  Carry  out  a \nquantitative risk analysis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook for Integrating Risk \nAnalysis in the Economic Analysis of Projects. \n \n(vi)  Together  with  item  (i),  for  project  monitoring  develop  a  set  of  verifiable \nmonitorable  performance  indicators,  including  operations,  financial, \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \nenvironmental,  socioeconomic,  and  poverty  reduction  parameters.
