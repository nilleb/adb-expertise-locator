The  Government  of  Bangladesh  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \nprovide  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  preparing  the  proposed  Padma  Multipurpose  Bridge \nProject for possible ADB financing. A Fact-Finding Mission visited Bangladesh from 27 February \nto 7 March 2005 and met with responsible officials of the agencies concerned including the \nEconomic  Relations  Division,  Ministry  of  Finance  (ERD);  the  Ministry  of  Communications \n(MOC);  and  the  Jamuna  Multipurpose  Bridge  Authority  (JMBA)1  of  the  Government  of \nBangladesh. This TA was developed on the basis of the understanding reached during the \nMission  on  the  goals,  purpose,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Bangladesh is a riverine country and the major rivers flowing through the country are the \nGanges,  the  Jamuna,  the  Meghna,  and  the  Padma.  The  Padma  River  is  formed  by  the \nconfluence  of  the  Ganges  and  the  Jamuna  rivers.  Historically,  this  river  system  has  split \nBangladesh into several sections, i.e., (i) the northwest zone bordered by the Ganges and the \nJamuna rivers; (ii) the east zone, which is east of the Jamuna River where the capital, Dhaka, \nand the major port, Chittagong, are situated; and (iii) the southwest zone, isolated by the Padma \nand the Ganges rivers. With the completion of the Jamuna Bridge in June 1998, transport \nconnectivity of the northwest zone to the economically important east zone has improved, thus \naccelerating the socioeconomic development of the northwest zone. The completion of the \nPakshey  Bridge  in  April  2004  provides  connectivity  between  the  northwest  zone  and  the \nsouthwest zone. The construction of a bridge over the Padma River will mean that the last \nremaining major bridge necessary to provide comprehensive connectivity between all the major \nregions of the country will have been completed.  \n \n3.  The feasibility study for the proposed bridge is being carried out by consultants financed \nby the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The findings of the study show that \nbridging  this  gap  in  the  domestic  road  infrastructure  network  is  important  for  the  overall \nsocioeconomic  development  of  Bangladesh  because  road  transport  plays  an  increasingly \nimportant role in the country. Between 1971 and 2001, transport demand by all modes in \nBangladesh increased at about 6% per annum for passenger traffic and 5% per annum for \nfreight traffic. The modal share of roads increased from 54% in 1971 to 73% in 2001. The \nprovision of a bridge across the Padma River is also important for intermodal connection as it \nwill immediately provide better road access to Mongla Port, which is the country\u2019s second \nlargest port. The bridge will also provide the potential for a rail link to the port if a road-cum-rail \nbridge option is found feasible. From the subregional perspective, it can provide a second \naccess  for  transit  of  goods  between  the  South  Asian  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation \n(SASEC) countries. The proposed project components are (i) a 5,580-meter-long bridge with \nprovision for future rail tracks; (ii) a 12\u2013kilometer (km)-long 2-lane dual carriage approach road; \nand (iii) 16.3 km-long bank protection works along the river. \n \n4.  The Padma multipurpose bridge is expected to generate substantial impacts not only on \nthe transport of goods and people but also on the larger areas of the national and regional \neconomy, thereby facilitating an increase in economic production, employment, and income and \n                                                 \n1  The Jamuna Multipurpose Bridge Authority will be renamed as the Bangladesh Bridge Authority pursuant to a \nrecent decision of the Cabinet.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 15 February 2005.   \n ", "2   \nultimately poverty reduction. The feasibility study carried out by JICA indicates that construction \nof the Padma bridge will increase the growth rate of the national gross domestic product by \n1.2%, raise value-added factor income by 1.4%, and provide 743,000 person-years of new \nemployment opportunities in total. The southwest zone will receive the biggest impacts from the \nPadma multipurpose bridge and its regional economic development will be accelerated by the \nimproved access to/from Dhaka, which is the largest market in the country. The bridge will also \nallow greater mobility for surplus labor force members to go to other regions; and will encourage \nthe setting up of new industrial units, thus generating employment opportunities in the impact \nzone. Increased employment opportunities and increased labor mobility will also result in higher \nwage rates for workers in traditional occupations within the impact zone. Hence, the proposed \nPadma Bridge project can potentially play a very significant poverty reduction role for the \nsouthwest zone. The Government will be funding a study for preparing the land acquisition plan \n(LAP), the resettlement action plan (RAP), and the environmental management plan (EMP). The \ngovernment-funded study is expected to start in May 2005 and will be completed by October \n2005.  \n \n5.  The Jamuna Bridge impact study also pointed to several factors that can improve the \nproject design:  (i) the environmental assessment and the social assessment recommendations \nwill enhance poverty reduction impacts are actually implemented; (ii) there is need for social and \npoverty impact analysis prior to project implementation; and (iii) the fact that the toll rate was \nimposed without considering the impact on the poor. The shortcomings pointed out were noted \nwhen preparing the terms of reference for this TA. The TA will also consider the macroeconomic \nand fiscal impacts of proceeding with the proposed project as well as public\u2013private participation \noptions that could potentially reduce the Government\u2019s financial burden and/or increase the \nefficiency of the implementation, and operation and maintenance (O&M) of the proposed bridge. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The  economic  development  and  poverty  reduction  potential  of  the  bridge  can  be \nenhanced  through  systematic  project  design  incorporating  environmental  assessment  and \nsocial assessment recommendations to enhance the poverty reduction impacts. The toll rate \noptions will also be studied, keeping in mind the need to attract private sector investment, if \npossible, while ensuring that the poor are not unduly adversely impacted. The TA will build on \nboth the JICA feasibility study and the government-funded study on social and environmental \nsafeguards. It will, therefore, review and carry out due diligence on the technical, economic, \nfinancial,  social,  and  environmental  analyses.  The  TA  will  also  consider  public-private \npartnership (PPP) options that can potentially reduce the Government\u2019s financial burden and/or \nincrease the efficiency of the implementation, O&M of the proposed Padma bridge. The design \nand monitoring framework is shown in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  Engineering and Project Management Analysis. The TA will review the engineering \naspects of the preliminary study and design prepared by the JICA feasibility study consultants. \nThe TA consultant will ensure that the studies are based on uniform design methodologies and \ndesign standards, with allowable variations on account of specific site conditions. Sites will be \nvisited as necessary. Topographic surveys, hydrological risks of changing river morphology, \ndesign  standards,  traffic  studies,  proposed  improvements  and  alignment,  soil  and  material \ninvestigations,  pavement  options,  toll  plaza  and  wayside  amenities,  drainage  and  bridge \n ", "  3\nstructures, road safety measures, contract packaging, and cost estimates will be reviewed. The \nTA will carry out institutional assessment of JMBA, focusing on the suitability of the current staff \nstrength and expertise, authority inherent in JMBA for successful project management, and its \ncurrent reporting arrangements. In the institutional assessment, the consultant will take into \ncognizance institutional arrangements that have proved successful in implementing other major \ninfrastructure projects in Bangladesh, including the Jamuna multipurpose bridge, and make \nrecommendations on the institutional arrangements and powers that need to be granted to \nJMBA to ensure successful implementation of the proposed Padma multipurpose bridge. \n \n8.  Economic  Analysis.  Assistance  will  be  provided  to  supplement  JMBA  efforts  in \nensuring that the economic analysis is in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic \nAnalysis of Projects. The TA will review and improve as necessary (i) the feasibility study, \nconsultants\u2019 economic analysis of the proposed Padma Multipurpose Bridge project; and (ii) the \ntraffic forecast, cost estimates, and benefits. Additional surveys will be carried out as necessary. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) will then be recalculated. Sensitivity analyses will be \ncarried out with the project\u2019s risk assessment.  The TA will analyze the poverty reduction impact \nof  subproject  roads  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  for  Integrating  Poverty  Impact \nAssessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects. The TA will conduct additional surveys as \nnecessary, prepare the benefits distribution analysis, and estimate the poverty impact ratio of \nthe proposed project. In addition, the TA will look into the fiscal implications of the financing, \nsustainability,  and  foreign  exchange  components  of  the  Government  taking  loans  for  the \nimplementation  of  the  Project  and  identify  how  the  Government  can  raise  the  revenue \nnecessary to finance its portion of the total cost. The TA will do a comparative economic \nassessment of the project vis-a-vis other proposed mega projects.  \n \n9.  Financial Analysis. The TA will carry out financial analysis of the proposed project in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Governance  of \nInvestment Projects. The TA will review project cost estimates and propose financing plan, and \nprepare financial projections as well as the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and compare it \nwith  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital.  Sensitivity  analysis  will be  carried  out  with  the \nproject\u2019s risk assessment. The TA will assess financial management by JMBA.  \n \n10.  Public-Private  Partnership  Scheme  Development.  The  TA  will  design  a  PPP \ninvestment package, including financial evaluation in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nFinancial Governance and Management of Investment Projects. Financial models and PPP \noptions will be developed taking into account the current PPP policy, preference to transfer the \ncommercial  and  revenue  risks  to  the  private  sector  as  much  as  possible,  and  best  PPP \npractices in Bangladesh and regional projects. Financial and sensitivity analyses will be carried \nout, investment packages will be designed, and a framework of concession arrangements \ncovering construction and O&M will be developed. This will also include analysis of affordability \nand  willingness-to-pay  surveys.  If  PPP  is  found  feasible,  the  consultant  will  also  develop \nconcession  agreements  and  criteria  for  selection  of  bidders,  and  may  assist  in  evaluating \nproposals and selecting successful bidders.  \n \n11.  Environmental  Impact  Study.  The  TA  will  assist  JMBA  in  complying  with  ADB's \nenvironmental safeguard policies, by ensuring that environmental assessments are prepared in \naccordance  with  the  Government's  environmental  requirements  and  ADB's  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003). The consultant will review, verify, and recommend any revision \nnecessary  to  the  environmental  management  plan  prepared  by  the  government-funded \nconsultants and prepare environmental impact assessment (EIA) and summary EIA (SEIA) \nreports including an environmental management and monitoring plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s \n ", "4   \nenvironmental policy, taking into account Bangladesh\u2019s Environmental Preservation Act and \nRules, 1997.  \n \n12.  Social Impact Study. The TA will assist JMBA in complying with ADB's social safeguard \npolicies, by ensuring that social analyses are carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \nfor the Incorporation of Social Dimensions. The summary initial poverty and social analysis is in \nAppendix 2. The consultant will review, verify, and revise (as necessary) the LAP and RAP \nprepared by the government-funded consultants. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1 million equivalent comprising $480,000 in \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $520,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  The  details  are  in \nAppendix 3. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The Government will finance $200,000 equivalent by providing office \naccommodation, support facilities, counterpart staff, local transportation, maps, reports, and \nother logistical support. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  JMBA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  JMBA  will  set  up  a  project \nimplementation  unit  headed  by  a  project  director,  who  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nimplementation of the TA, including coordinating with concerned line ministries, agencies, and \nexternal  funding  agencies.  The  Government  has  assured  the  Mission  that  all  required \ncounterpart staff, office space, furniture, equipment, support facilities for surveys, maps, reports, \nand other support services will be made available to the consultants in a timely manner. All \nequipment for the TA will be procured according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and will \nbe turned over to JMBA upon TA completion. \n \n15.  An international consultant firm that can supply a team with expertise in the areas of (i) \nroad and bridge engineering, (ii) macro and transport economic analysis, (iii) financial analysis \nof transport projects, and (iv) structuring PPP schemes in roads and bridge projects, will be \nrecruited for the TA. Domestic consultants in these fields will be engaged by the international \nconsultant  firm,  which  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  the  TA  components.  Individual \nconsultants will be recruited to carry out (i) social analysis, poverty impact, and resettlement \nstudies; and (ii) environmental assessment of the proposed project. It is anticipated that a total \nof 16 person-months international and 34 person-months domestic consulting services will be \nrequired. All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements for the engagement of domestic consultants satisfactory to \nADB. The consultant firm will be selected according to quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) \nprocedures and a simplified technical proposal will be requested from shortlisted firms. The TA \nis expected to start in November 2005 and will be completed by May 2006. The outline terms of \nreference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  4.  Seminars  and  workshops  will  be  held  to \ndisseminate the output of the TA.  \n \n ", "5\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.

One major reason for that is the \npoor transport connectivity between that zone and the eastern zone where the major centers of economic \nactivities are concentrated. Improving transport connectivity by linking the southwest zone with the east \nzone will allow for spillover economic activities to be established in the southwest zone, thus contributing \nto income generation. Economic activities can be complemented by the establishment of road transport \nservices to improve the attractiveness of the zone. Better transport links will also allow for greater labor \nmobility, thus creating more employment opportunities for residents of the area. The result will be a \npotential upward pressure on wages even for labor force participants who remain in the southwest zone. \nThese consequences can result in a significant impact on poverty rates. \n \n \n \nB.
