INTRODUCTION \n1.  Intra-regional trade within East Asia has grown faster than trade with world markets. \nProspects for future growth in trade will, however, depend on investment in infrastructure. In the \narchipelagic Southeast Asia (aSEA) subregion,1 infrastructure investments have failed to keep \npace with growth in trade. With constrained government fiscal capacities in the region, the \ninfrastructure gaps can only be filled by fostering new approaches, modalities, and sources of \ninvestment. \n \n2.    Through regional cooperation in aSEA, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will support \nactivities  covering  multicountry  participation,  including  cross-border  infrastructure  and \nsubregional initiatives. These activities will encompass (i) the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-\nMalaysia-Philippines-East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) initiative established in 1994; and \n(ii) the more recent Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand-Growth Triangle (IMT-GT) grouping. The main \nchallenge for both groupings is to connect island populations, thereby enabling economic and \nsocial development through improved connectivity and cooperation. \n    \n3.  To develop ADB\u2019s proposed support, several stakeholder consultations were held, which \nculminated in a fact-finding mission in June 2007 to agree with aSEA governments the goals, \nscope, approach, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements for a regional technical \nassistance (RETA) project.2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The region contains countries at varying levels of development, and with substantially \ndifferent rates of economic growth. Overall, however, growth is around 4-5% per annum. For \nthis to increase, or even be maintained, will require investments in basic economic infrastructure \n\u2013 energy and transport in particular \u2013 to be around 5-6% of gross domestic product (GDP), \nrather than the 2-3% that is presently typical, particularly in Indonesia and the Philippines. The \ngovernments alone will not be able to mobilize the substantial additional funding required. The \nprivate sector and multilateral and bilateral development partners must also be involved. The \nproposed  RETA  will  provide  a  basis  for  identifying  programs  and  projects  that  support \ninfrastructure  development,  in  the  energy  and  transport  sectors  within  the  aSEA  country \ngrouping, with an emphasis on those that have regional characteristics. \n \nA.  Energy Sector \n5.  The energy sector is at different stages of development in the region. For example, in \nMindanao, the Philippines, about 800 megawatts (MW) of additional generation capacity will be \nneeded over 2010\u20132014 to meet demand growing at 6.5% per year. Yet other areas have \npower surpluses that could be traded across borders if the transmission infrastructure was \navailable. An example is Sarawak in Malaysia, which has large hydropower-based and hence \nrelatively low cost power generation, while neighboring West Kalimantan in Indonesia relies on \nvery  expensive  diesel  generation.  Linking  these  two  areas  by  an  interconnected  power \ntransmission system will not only improve reliability and overall economic efficiency but will \nallow electricity to be delivered to customers in Kalimantan at a much lower cost than is \npresently the case.   \n \n                                                 \n1  Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Singapore. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 18 May 2007. \n ", "2   \n6.  The aSEA governments are also examining alternative energy options such as small \nhydropower, solar, wind, and biomass, and demand-side options (energy efficiency), to meet \ngrowing energy demand. This focus on alternatives has increased of late, due to the rapidly \nincreasing cost of traditional petroleum-based energy sources. Despite the significant potential \nthroughout  the  region  for  renewable  energy  and  opportunities  for  saving  energy  through \nefficiency improvements, typically at the national level, only a fraction of this potential is being \ndeveloped. This situation exists at least in part because the countries are approaching the issue \nin a piecemeal manner. This comment applies within the countries themselves, but even more \nso regionally, where there has been to date very little coordination and exchange of information. \nThe proposed RETA will address this by establishing linkages among the countries to assist \nthem  with  sharing  information  and  developing  approaches  to  increasing  the  proportion  of \nalternative  energy  and  energy  efficiency  in  their  power  sector  planning.  While  the  bulk  of \ninvestments that will arise from this initiative will likely be national, there will be a substantial \nbenefit gained from developing common approaches to what are in essence common issues, \nnot least because the power sector and natural resource bases of the aSEA countries, on which \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency programs will be built, are themselves very similar. \n \n7.  Overall, the proposed RETA will address all these issues for the energy sector in aSEA \nby assessing regional demand, undertaking pre-feasibility studies for potential investments, and \npreparing a list of conventional, renewable energy, and energy efficiency projects that could be \nsuitable for subsequent detailed development and financing.  \n \nB.  Transport Sector  \n8.  As for energy, investment in the region\u2019s transport sector is not keeping pace with \ndemand,  and  transport  bottlenecks  are  restricting  investment  and  curtailing  growth.  Again \nassuming an overall economic growth rate of 4-5%, transport demand is growing at between 6 \nand 10% per annum. Infrastructure investment of about 2-3% of GDP per annum, as noted \nabove, is not adequate to meet this future growth, and even less so given the lack of past \ninvestment in providing and maintaining adequate and efficient transport infrastructure. This \napplies to all infrastructure sectors but, given the archipelagic nature of the region, particularly to \nland and sea transport, and the linkages between them. Reflecting this reality, transport has \nbeen identified by the aSEA governments as a priority sector, within the framework of the \noverall  development  of  economic  corridors  throughout  the  region.  The  BIMP-EAGA \nGovernments have requested ADB to carry out a study for two BIMP-EAGA corridors: the \nWestern Borneo Economic Corridor (land-based) and the Greater Sulu Sulawesi Economic \nCorridor (maritime). For IMT-GT, there is an urgent requirement for a master plan for transport \ninfrastructure in Sumatra, a critical component of the IMT-GT subregion, as part of an economic \ncorridor that encompasses Sumatra, Peninsular Malaysia, and southern Thailand. \n \n9.  Again reflecting the archipelagic nature of the region, improved port connectivity across \nthe Strait of Malacca between Indonesia\u2019s Sumatra Island and Peninsular Malaysia/Southern \nThailand requires particular attention. For example, Sumatra\u2019s Aceh province is planning to \ndevelop its ports to improve linkages with South Asia, and with Malaysia and Thailand. The \ntransport component of the RETA will address each of these aspects of regional transport \ndevelopment. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n10.  The principal objective of the RETA is to promote higher and sustainable growth in aSEA \nby  increasing  investment  in  transport  and  energy  infrastructure.  This  will  be  achieved  by ", "3 \npreparing a list of subprojects and completing pre-feasibility studies for the highest priority of \nthem, to a stage suitable for further development as actual investments.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The RETA\u2019s impact will be improvement in access to power and transport infrastructure \nfor people in aSEA. Reliable and cheaper power will be accessible to a larger population, a \nframework  for  bilateral  power  trade  between  utilities  in  Malaysia  and  Indonesia  will  be \nformulated, and priority investments in selected economic corridors will be identified.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The activities will build on previous work in the area in close coordination with the \nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  Secretariat,  the  BIMP-EAGA  facilitation \ncenter,  and  the  governments.  The  activities  will  be  grouped  into  energy  and  transport \ncomponents. Both components will ensure appropriate environmental and social planning and \nassessment is done.3 \n \n1.  Energy Sector \n13.  The  main  output  of  the  energy  sector  component  of  the  RETA  will  be  several \nimplementable and financially viable subprojects covering conventional and renewable energy, \nand energy efficiency. The following three subcomponents have been identified as priorities \nwithin the energy sector.  \n \na.  West Kalimantan\u2013Sarawak Transmission Line  \n14.  This transmission line project is an essential building block for a power grid on the island \nof Borneo. The RETA will study the financial, economic, and technical viability of the proposed \ntransmission line by reviewing past technical studies and establishing medium-term demand \nand supply forecast on the Indonesian and Malaysian power systems.  \n \nb.  Study of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Projects \n15.  This  component  of  the  RETA  will  work  with  the  aSEA  Governments  to  develop  a \ncommon  approach  to  renewable  (biomass,  biofuels,  micro-hydro,  solar)  energy-based \ngeneration projects and energy efficiency projects for meeting energy demand. It will (i) identify \nseveral  energy  generation  and  energy  efficiency  subprojects  through  consultation  with  the \ngovernments, utilities, and large industries (for cogeneration and energy efficiency options); (ii) \nidentify one or more subprojects with high economic and financial viability, through appropriate \nscreening  criteria;  and  (iii)  develop  prefeasibility  studies  for  them.  The  initial  longlist  of \nsubprojects will include the projects identified by the road map4 for BIMP-EAGA, prepared with \nADB assistance.  \n \n16.  The  RETA  will  also  examine  innovative  financing  mechanisms,  instruments,  or \nmodalities to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency investments, and for financing \nsmall-scale projects. This could lead to a subsequent project to finance some of these projects \n                                                 \n3  With appropriate reference to work to be done under the proposed ADB-financed RETA for Strengthening Sound \nEnvironmental Management in aSEA. \n4  ADB. 2007. Road Map for the Development of the Energy Sector in the BIMP-EAGA Region. Manila.  \n ", "4   \non a pilot basis through, for example, infrastructure funds, credit facilities, guarantees). The \nstudy will also assess the benefits of carbon credits under the clean development mechanism.  \n \nc.  Study of Conventional Energy Projects  \n17.  This  component  will  study  conventional  energy  projects  identified  by  the  aSEA \ngovernments, some of which need financial support to complete analyses of technical, financial, \nand economic viability. The initial long list of projects will include the projects identified by the \nBIMP-EAGA road map (footnote 4). This component will also develop prefeasibility studies for \nthe highest priority subprojects to a stage suitable for detailed study and subsequent financing. \n \n2.  Transport Sector  \n18.  The transport component will develop (i) a master plan for the IMT-GT connectivity \ncorridors in  Sumatra,  including  a detailed  assessment  for  improving  port connectivity  from \nSumatra to Malaysia and Thailand, and road transport within Sumatra; and (ii) a study in BIMP-\nEAGA to identify viable projects in the Western Borneo and Greater Sulu Sulawesi Economic \nCorridors.  \n \na.  IMT-GT Connectivity Corridors \n19.  The IMT-GT connectivity corridors include (i) the Eastern Sumatra national highways \nfrom north to south, (ii)  two corridors across the Strait of Malacca; (iii) the highway along the \nwestern coast of southern Thailand and Peninsular Malaysia from Trang to Malacca; and (iv)  \nthe Aceh-Phuket-Runong corridor. Ports in Sumatra also require rehabilitation and expansion. \nThe largest port in Sumatra, Medan, is operating far beyond its design capacity. Southern \nThailand  also  lacks  deepwater  ports,  and  is  thus  dependent  on  shipping  exports  through \nMalaysia or Singapore. The northernmost province of Sumatra, Aceh, is also exploring options \nfor  developing  its  ports.  Improved  port  connectivity  across  the  Strait  of  Malacca  would \nsubstantially improve IMT-GT subregional cooperation.  \n \nb.  BIMP-EAGA Connectivity Corridors \n20.  For BIMP-EAGA, the study for the two corridors (para. 8) will analyze the constraints to \neconomic integration. The analysis will include physical linkages such as roads, waterways, and \nair and sea transport. The analysis of trade integration will examine the volume, value, and flow \nof commodities being traded; and the potential for expanded trade between the corridors. The \ninvestment analysis will look at the comparative and competitive advantages of BIMP-EAGA, \nand  at  mechanisms  for  promoting  foreign  and  domestic  investments.  Tourism  is  a  major \nproductive sector in BIMP-EAGA, and the potential of this sector to promote pro-poor growth is \nwell known.  \n \n3.  Program Coordination and Additional Study  \n21.  Under  this  component,  ADB  will  coordinate  the  overall  program  for  aSEA.  This \ncoordination  will include  (i)  developing  a  repository  of  energy  and  transport  sector  related \ndocuments and policy papers relevant for the region; (ii) coordinating the RETA consultants\u2019 \nwork and advising ADB and the governments on key strategic policy issues; (iii) maintaining \nADB\u2019s presence in working group meetings; (iv) identifying and alerting ADB to key strategic \nevents and trends in the regional policy setting; and (v) developing a database for transport and \nenergy stakeholders in the regional power and transport agencies and companies.    ", "5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The total cost of the proposed RETA is estimated at $2.75 million. It will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program ($1.25 million) and the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration  Fund  ($1.5  million)  under  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Financing \nPartnership Facility. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  RETA  and  will  oversee  its  overall \nadministration.5 Local counterparts will vary according to the country, sector, and whether the \nidentified projects are public or private. \n \n24.  The TA will require 212 person-months of consulting services: 86 from international \nconsultants and 126 from national experts. The consultants for the energy component will have, \namong others, experience in (i) legal and regulatory frameworks, (ii) environmental and social \nimpact  assessment,  (iii)  power  transmission,  (iv)  renewable  energy  development,  and  (v) \ndemand-side management and energy efficiency. The consultants for the transport component \nwill  have  experience  in  (i)  transport  planning,  (ii)  highway  engineering,  (iii) financial  and \neconomic analysis, (iv) social and environmental impact assessment, and (v) road safety. The \nconsultants  for  the  program  coordination  component  will  include  international  and  national \nspecialists with relevant experience.  \n \n25.  Two  consulting  firms  will  be  engaged,  one  each  for  the  energy  and  transport \ncomponents, by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  ADB  will  select  consultants  using  its  quality  and  cost-based \nselection methodology (80:20) with full technical proposals. In addition, individual consultants \nwill be recruited for the program coordination component. The major reports required from the \nconsultants  for  each  component  will  be  (i)  an  inception  report  describing  a  detailed  work \nprogram (3 weeks after the start of the RETA), (ii) progress reports each quarter, (iii) a draft final \nreport, and (iv) a final report. Both groups of consultants will arrange workshops and seminars \nas required throughout the duration of the RETA. Outline terms of reference for the consultants \nfor each component are in Appendix 3. \n \n26.  The RETA will be implemented over about 2 years, ending in March 2010. All equipment \nwill be purchased according to ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and will be transferred to the respective regional bodies after completion of the RETA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n27.  The President recommends that the Board approve (i) ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 to be financed on a grant basis \nby  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Fund  under  the  Regional  Cooperation  and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the \nequivalent of $1,250,000 for the Efficiency Improvement and Connectivity Strengthening in \nArchipelagic Southeast Asia Project. \n                                                 \n5  Activities funded by this RETA may only commence within a particular DMC after ADB has received written \nconfirmation of no objection from the particular DMC. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \n    Data   \nDesign  Performance  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nImprovement in access  Increased investments  Industry publications and  \u2022  Regional \nto power and transport  by governments and  journals  governments \ninfrastructure for people  the private sector    establish and \nin archipelagic    National development  maintain an \nSoutheast Asia (aSEA)  plans  effective \ncooperation \nframework.  \nOutcome      Assumptions \nCheaper imported  Import from Sarawak of  Periodic government  \u2022  Benefits from \nelectricity in West  about 80 MW capacity  publications   energy efficiency \nKalimantan  during peak times and    recognized by \n  overall about 350 GWh    key decision \n  each year by West    makers \n  Kalimantan     \n      \u2022  Consumers\u2019 \nIncreased indigenous  Renewable, indigenous  Reports published by the  ability to pay for \nelectricity generation  power generation  System Control Division  connection to and \nand reduced GHG  source identified and  of PLN and SESCO  consumption of \nemissions  implemented    electricity \n       \nEconomic corridors and  Government policy  Government statistics,  Risk \ninvestments within the  statements  International Energy  \u2022  Actual demand \ncorridors identified   Agency publications  for electricity \nlower than \nforecast \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
