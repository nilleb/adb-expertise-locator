I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $40,000,000 in Everbridge Partners Fund I, L.P. (Everbridge I).1  \n \n2.  The proposed investment in Everbridge I will provide growth capital to about ten middle-\nmarket companies operating primarily in the health care, business services, and consumer \nsectors, in India, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, \nthe Philippines, and Thailand).2 These companies often lack access to affordable capital because \nequity financing is generally limited and traditional bank financing is difficult to source without hard \nassets that can be pledged as collateral. Furthermore, many companies in emerging Asia need \nimproved professional management to scale up their operations. The proposed investment by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) in Everbridge I would help deepen capital markets and support \nAsia\u2019s growing private sector.3 \n \n3.  Everbridge I will be established as a Cayman Islands limited partnership, which will invest, \nvia Everbridge Partners Master Fund I Private Limited, the Singapore master fund (together: the \nfund), in companies with substantial operations in Asia.4 Everbridge Partners Private Limited \n(together with its affiliates: Everbridge), a Singapore company, will be the fund manager. The \nfund\u2019s target capitalization is $750 million.  \n \nII.  THE FUND \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n4.  Description. Everbridge is a newly formed investment management firm spun out of a \nleading private equity firm, Capital Group Private Markets (CGPM). CGPM is part of Capital \nGroup, a financial services company with its headquarters in the United States, specializing in \nmutual funds, private equity, and investment services (7,500 employees, $1.8 trillion of assets \nunder management). Everbridge was founded by the ex-managing partner of CGPM Asia, \nLeonard Kim, who now leads a team of ex-CGPM employees.5 Everbridge is headquartered in \nSingapore and has an additional office in Beijing. The Everbridge team (through CGPM) has a \n20-year history (since 1998) investing across multiple market and economic cycles in Asia.

[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \n \n1  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n2  A climate change target amount cannot be specified as this is an investment into a fund (as opposed to an investment \ninto a company) and the composition of the underlying investee companies is not yet known. \n3  Everbridge I\u2019s investments could also help companies scale up exports of their products and technology so that \nbenefits could flow to other countries in the region. \n4  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n5  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n6  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n ", "2 \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].7,8 \n \n6.  Investment  identification.  Through  the  market  mapping  of  Asia\u2019s  private  equity \nlandscape, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) first met the Everbridge team \nin September 2018 and has been in regular contact with Leonard Kim and his team since then. \nPSOD  has  identified  Everbridge\u2019s  profile  to  be  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  private  equity  fund \ninvestment guidelines: \n(i)  it is one of the more experienced fund management teams in Asia with an \nextensive 20-year track record (through CGPM); \n(ii)  through its management of four similar funds, the team has demonstrated its ability \nto add value to investee companies; and \n(iii)  the fund is expected to provide attractive co-investment opportunities in PSOD\u2019s \ntargeted sectors and countries. \n \n7.  Everbridge\u2019s  proposed  investment  mandate  supports  ADB\u2019s  development  focus  as \nevidenced by the Everbridge team\u2019s prior investments (while at CGPM) in a range of health care \nand education initiatives, including the largest privately owned maternity hospital chain in the PRC \nby number of births (Jinxin Maternity), India\u2019s fourth largest pharmaceutical company by domestic \nsales of chronic medicines (Intas), and an innovative education service platform for distance \nlearning and vocational training in India (Manipal Global Education Services).9 Everbridge\u2019s \nstrategy also focuses on tech-enabled businesses. The rapid increase in smartphone and mobile \nbroadband penetration throughout emerging Asia has driven the widespread adoption of tech-\nenabled products and services. Innovative solutions are increasingly enabling companies to reach \nunderserved populations in remote areas and low-income groups, and the Everbridge team has \nstrategically focused on investing in businesses that benefit from this trend. Given ADB\u2019s focus \non promoting innovative technology and digital transformation, its relationship with Everbridge \ncan provide ADB an opportunity to increase its exposure to and build domain knowledge in this \nimpactful space.10 \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n8.  Everbridge I will target about 10 investments in the range of $50 million to $150 million \neach, and it is expected that such investments will primarily be in segments relating to health care, \nbusiness  services,  and  consumer  products.  The  fund  manager  will  also  actively  seek  co-\ninvestments for transactions requiring larger equity commitments. Everbridge I expects to make \nmainly influential minority investments (ownership stake above 5% and below 50%) with a typical \nfour to five year holding period for each investment.11 Everbridge seeks to invest in opportunities \nthat exhibit some of the following characteristics: \n(i)  Strong, secular growth. Everbridge targets businesses that enjoy high growth \nrates with structural drivers. The fund manager will avoid businesses that are \nheavily exposed to general macroeconomic cycles, commodity cycles, and credit \ncycles. \n \n7  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n8  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n9  The technology and products of Everbridge\u2019s future portfolio companies have the potential to benefit countries across \nAsia. \n10 ADB. 2018.

", "3 \n(ii)  High-quality management teams. Everbridge invests in management teams that \nstrive to be best-in-class operators, create significant value for shareholders, and \nwant to establish strong governance standards. \n(iii)  Innovation  and  technology.  Technologies  such  as  mobile  broadband  are \nreshaping economies in emerging Asia. Everbridge seeks to invest in businesses \nthat leverage innovation and technology to create new market demand. \n(iv)  Potential to add value. Everbridge focuses on investment targets with significant \nvalue-creation potential. Everbridge spends time with portfolio companies, typically \nvia holding board seats, to strengthen management, financial controls, strategy, \ngovernance,  and  operating  processes  to  help  these  businesses  successfully \nscale.12 \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n9.

[This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].15,16  \n \n11.  Management. Everbridge currently consists of 16 employees, including 10 investment \nprofessionals, 1 compliance director, and 5 support staff, who are based either in Singapore or in \nBeijing. Everbridge anticipates hiring six additional investment professionals to support the fund\u2019s \noperations after its initial close. In addition, Everbridge leverages a network of six operating \npartners who will support the investment team for origination, due diligence, and post-investment \nvalue-creation activities. \n \n12.  Governance structure. Everbridge\u2019s investment process is organized in five stages and \nincludes two investment committee meetings. \n(i)  Thematic screening. The Everbridge team develops investment themes within its \ntargeted sectors and identifies the most promising companies in each industry.  \n(ii)  Pipeline development. During the pipeline development stage, an initial deal \nteam,  typically  consisting  of  one  senior  professional  and  one  or  two  junior \nprofessionals, will be formed to research the key thesis and risk factors. This stage \nmay  entail  several  on-site  meetings  and  numerous  follow-up  information \nexchanges with the target company. \n(iii)  Initial investment committee review. When the relevant information is available, \npromising investment opportunities are escalated to a formal initial investment \ncommittee  review  session.  This  discussion  is  solely  focused  on  the  specific \ninvestment opportunity. If three members of the investment committee, including \nLeonard Kim, preliminarily support the opportunity, a due diligence plan and \n \n12 [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n13 [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n14 [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n15 [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n16 [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s Access to Information \nPolicy, para. 17.2.(v)]. \n ", "4 \nbudget will be approved.  \n(iv)  Investment  committee  workshop.  During  the  weeks  that  follow  the  initial \ninvestment committee review, the deal team will spend a significant amount of time \nengaging with the company\u2019s management, customers, and suppliers, and will \nwork  with  Capital  Group  colleagues  and  third-party  advisors  to  thoroughly \nunderstand  all  aspects of the  investment.  The  deal team typically  organizes \nmultiple deep-dive workshops into various high-priority aspects of the investment \nopportunity  for  the  investment  committee.  Investment  committee  members \ntypically give feedback after each workshop. \n(v)  Final investment committee discussion. If an investment progresses to an \nadvanced stage, a final investment committee discussion will be organized. At this \nfinal discussion, a complete investment proposal and a compliance checklist are \ncirculated. After all aspects of the investment are discussed, the  investment \ncommittee  will  take  a  final  vote  on  whether  to  undertake  the  investment.  A \nproposed investment must receive four affirmative votes, including that of Leonard \nKim, to be formally approved by the investment committee. \n \n13.  Once capital is disbursed, the Everbridge team will actively engage with the investee \ncompany based on the agreed road map to improve the business. The tailored plans identify and \nfocus on key critical areas where Everbridge can add value and drive immediate changes. \nMoreover, Everbridge reaches out to its panel of industry experts and strategic advisors to provide \nrelevant advice and inputs to the investee company. Everbridge holds regular review meetings \nwith the key management team of the portfolio companies and participates in board meetings. \n \n14.  Advisory committee. The fund will establish an advisory committee consisting of at least \nthree  limited  partner  members  independent  of  Everbridge.  The  advisory  committee\u2019s  remit \nincludes advising on conflicts of interest, related party transactions, and valuation matters. \nEverbridge has agreed to reserve ADB a seat on the advisory committee. \n \nD.

THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n16.  ADB will provide an equity investment of up to $40,000,000 in Everbridge I. ADB\u2019s \nproposed investment will not exceed 25% (and is not expected to exceed 10%) of the fund\u2019s \naggregate committed capital and will not result in ADB being the single largest investor in the \nfund. \n \nB.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  Exit strategy. The fund will have a 10-year term from initial closing.17 The anticipated exit \nstrategies for the fund\u2019s investments include public offerings, trade sales of portfolio companies \nto local and foreign strategic buyers, and secondary sales to other private equity funds. \n \n19.  Reporting arrangements. Everbridge will be required to provide ADB with (i) quarterly \nreports; and (ii) audited annual financial statements, an overview of the portfolio with brief \ninformation on each portfolio company\u2019s performance, an annual development effectiveness \nmonitoring report, and an annual environmental and social monitoring report. ADB will review this \ninformation and follow up with the fund manager if more information or clarification is needed. If \nthe information received from the fund manager raises issues that could impair the value of ADB\u2019s \ninvestment in the fund, ADB can place the fund on a watch list for more frequent review and closer \nmonitoring. \n \n20.  Everbridge will be required to report annually on environmental and social safeguard \nissues in compliance with its environmental and social management system (ESMS). ADB will \nmonitor the timing and quality of the safeguards reports and offer guidance if the fund manager \nrequires clarification on ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements. \n \nD.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n21.  Capital mobilization and strategy validation. ADB\u2019s participation as an initial investor \nwill help anchor the fund and attract additional institutional capital to enable the fund to reach its \ntarget size. ADB\u2019s investment in the fund will allow Everbridge to achieve a diversified, well-\nbalanced institutional investor base for the fund. In addition, ADB\u2019s participation will provide \nvalidation of the fund\u2019s strategy, and its commercial and developmental attributes. \n \n22.  Setting standards. ADB will require Everbridge to implement an ESMS acceptable to \nADB that requires it to oblige its portfolio companies to comply with ADB\u2019s environmental and \nsocial safeguard requirements and report to ADB on development indicators. ADB will support \nEverbridge in its environmental and social risk appraisal of proposed portfolio companies. \n \n23.  Gender  equality.  ADB\u2019s  participation  will  promote  gender  equality  in  the  fund  and \ninvestee companies of the fund. Everbridge will work with ADB throughout the investment period \nin the design and implementation of an overarching gender policy to guide its efforts in achieving \ngender equality in its business and its investees companies, and that Everbridge will screen its \npotential investees using a gender equality scorecard developed in collaboration with ADB to \nassess their inclusiveness and diversity status and responsiveness to women\u2019s empowerment in \nthe workplace. Everbridge will be required to report annually to ADB using sex-disaggregated \ndata its efforts in appraisal and management of Everbridge I portfolio companies. \n \n24.  Governance oversight. As a member of Everbridge I\u2019s advisory committee, ADB can \nprovide oversight on governance and issues relating to conflicts of interest. \n \nE.  Risks \n \n25.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n32.  Impact.  The  equity  investment  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  development \naccelerated in targeted developing member countries (DMCs) through (i) promotion of innovative \ntech-enabled businesses primarily in the health care, business services, and consumer sectors; \nand (ii) strengthened capacity of private equity markets with respect to funding volume and \ndiversity of sector-specific business models. \n \n33.  Outcome. The equity investment will have the following outcome: financial sustainability \nand operational value addition of private equity investments demonstrated to benefit DMCs across \nAsia. \n \n34.  Outputs.  The  equity  investment  will  have  the  following  outputs:  (i)  Everbridge  I  is \nestablished, (ii) capital is invested, and (iii) Everbridge adopts a gender-inclusive approach. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n35.  Consistency  with  ADB  strategy.  The  proposed  investment  in  Everbridge  I  aligns \nstrongly with two operational priorities outlined in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (footnote 10). These \ninclude (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities by generating quality jobs, \nimproving education, and achieving better health for all; and (ii) fostering regional cooperation \nand integration by enhancing connectivity and strengthening finance sector cooperation. ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 also aims to expand private sector operations to support its operational priorities \nby (i) expanding regional reach through private equity funds, (ii) strengthening the finance sector \nand capital markets, and (iii) widening geographic coverage. Given its track record with CGPM, \nEverbridge is uniquely positioned to deliver on ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 themes through investments \nsuch as Go-Jek, which promotes regional cooperation and integration, and Innovent Biologics \nand Mankind Pharma, which deliver high-quality health care products and services. \n ", "7 \n36.  Consistency with country strategies. The investment in Everbridge I is aligned with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020, which promotes finance sector \ninfrastructure and supports commercially viable business models to assist in the continued \ndomestic rebalancing from industry to services.18 The investment in the fund is also consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2018\u22122022, which includes support for the \nhealth sector as a strategic priority and focuses on the importance of gender equality.19 The \ninvestment  in  Everbridge  I  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy  for \nIndonesia, 2016\u20132019, which prioritizes inclusive growth by improving job creation, deepening \ncapital markets, and investing in financial infrastructure.20 \n \n37.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  proposed \ninvestment in Everbridge I is consistent with ADB\u2019s plan for finance sector operations and its \nsubsequent review in 2017, which prioritize improved access to capital markets and regional \ncooperation  and  integration.21 The  investment  in  the  fund  is  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \noperational plan for health, 2015\u20132020, which strongly supports private sector approaches to \naddress quality, efficiency, and financing issues in the health sector.22 The Everbridge team\u2019s \nexperience in the health care industry and its ability to drive growth and create value in companies \nwithin the industry are reflected in CGPM\u2019s investments in Jinxin Maternity and Intas (para. 7). \n \n38.  [This information has been removed as it falls under the exception to disclosure in ADB\u2019s \nAccess to Information Policy, para. 17.2.(v)].23  \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n39.  Category FI. The project is classified category FI for impacts on environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous people in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). ADB has assessed the fund\u2019s potential environmental and social impacts, the risks \nassociated  with  the  existing  and  future  portfolio,  and  its  commitment  and  capacity  for \nenvironmental and social management as part of the safeguards due diligence process. \n \n40.  Based on review of available information (in relation to CGPM Fund IV), no past or future \nportfolio companies exhibit indicators of significant impacts or risks that would be classified as \ncategory  A  against  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  for  environmental,  involuntary \nresettlement, or indigenous people requirements. At the time of appraisal, Everbridge does not \nhave an ESMS in place that would satisfy ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement environmental and \nsocial policy requirements for financial intermediaries. Everbridge will engage an independent \nexternal expert to develop an ESMS prior to first disbursement by ADB. The external expert will \nfurther support Everbridge with training.

Some  gender  elements.  This  investment  is  categorized  as  having  some  gender \nelements. Everbridge recognizes the importance of gender equality in its operations and those of \nits investees, and has confirmed its willingness to implement measures to promote gender \nequality and/or women\u2019s empowerment following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development.24 \nEverbridge has indicated that it will work with ADB to implement gender inclusion and diversity \nactions, including developing and implementing a gender policy and a gender equality scorecard \nto screen all potential investees for their status and responsiveness to women\u2019s empowerment in \nthe workplace. Everbridge will be required to submit periodic reports to ADB on its efforts to \nimplement gender measures including sex-disaggregated data that will include, but not be limited \nto, the number of women working at different levels in portfolio companies, and their recruitment \nand retention rates. The ESMS will set out requirements for compliance with national labor laws. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n42.  Everbridge was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice \nrelating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.
