The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  hosted  a  meeting  of  the  Central  Asia  electricity \nregulators forum in Manila in March 2004 to assist members to build the capacity to implement \nregulatory and structural reforms in their power sectors.1 Delegates at the meeting requested regular \nmeetings to continue the structured consultation among similar member countries. In consideration \nof this suggestion, ADB proposed at the CAREC Senior Officials Meeting (SOM) in Almaty, on                    \n13\u201314 September 2004 a timeline for establishing the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC) Members Electricity Regulators Forum (CMERF).2 The timeline was endorsed by SOM \ndelegates  and  again  at  the  Third  CAREC  Ministerial  Conference  (MC)  held  in  Astana  on                    \n1  November  2004.  This  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  help  implement  the  proposal \nendorsed by the SOM and MC. Countries participating in the TA are Azerbaijan (AZE), People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC),  Kazakhstan  (KAZ),  Kyrgyz  Republic  (KGZ),  Mongolia  (MON),  and \nTajikistan (TAJ).3 \n \n2.  Under this timeline, the following activities have already been undertaken: (i) Public\u2013Private \nInfrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) support has been secured for preparing a diagnostic review \nof  regulatory  approaches  and  challenges  (DRRAC),  for  holding  the  July  2005  meeting,  and, \ntentatively, for two regional studies to be undertaken during 2005\u20132006. (ii) The DRRAC report, \nbased on an ADB study tour of all seven CAREC member countries, has been prepared and is \nexpected to be published by ADB in November 2005. It documents and assesses the baseline \nposition of each CAREC country with respect to electricity regulation and industry structure, and \nhelps  focus  CMERF's  agenda.  (iii)  A  CMERF  meeting  was  held  on  4\u20136  July 2005  in  Beijing, \ncohosted by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission of the PRC and ADB. (iv) A memorandum \nof  understanding  (MOU)  establishing  CMERF  was  drafted.  Comments  from  CAREC  member \ngovernments have been incorporated, and delegates at the Beijing meeting agreed to forward the \nMOU to the CAREC SOM to be considered for signing at the Fourth CAREC MC in November 2005. \n(v) Delegates at the Beijing meeting short-listed five study topics for program year 2005\u20132006. \nThree of the studies will be funded under this regional TA. PPIAF funding for the two other studies \nhas been tentatively approved, pending approval of the specific topics chosen. \n \n3.  The TA's impact and output, methodology and key activities, cost estimates and financing \nplan, and implementation arrangements are presented in this paper.4 The TA design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  CAREC members possess significant complementary energy resource endowments. KAZ, \nKGZ,  TAJ,  and  UZB  also  possess  the  common  gas  and  electricity  transmission  infrastructure \nnecessary to exploit these complementarities, but the poor condition of such infrastructure is an \nimpediment to trade. Currently, most energy trade in the region is on an exchange basis, and \nexternal power sources are used only when domestic producers are constrained. Deeper and more \neconomically rational trade will considerably reduce the economic (including environmental) cost of \nmeeting member countries' energy needs. This trade is vital, given the cold winters in all CAREC \nmember countries, the high energy intensities of most members' economies, and the increased \nindustrialization  envisioned  by  their  governments.  Establishment  of  transparent  power  trading \namong member countries will reduce the perceived political risk associated with investments in large \nprojects that could be implemented for export of energy to neighboring countries. \n                                                 \n1 This meeting was funded by the Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility, a multidonor technical assistance facility, \naimed at helping developing countries improve the quality of their infrastructure through private sector involvement. \n2  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Members  are:  Azerbaijan,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China, \nKazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \n3  Uzbekistan has not yet confirmed its no objection to inclusion, and will be included when it does so. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 8 April 2005. \n ", "2   \n \n5.  Ensuring that these opportunities can be properly utilized will require further improvements in \nthe structure and regulation of individual countries' domestic power sectors, as well as harmonized \nregulations for cross-border energy trade, transmission, and investment. The economic returns to \nimprovements in cross-border infrastructure will also depend on a resolution of regulatory and \nstructural issues. \n \n6.  Almost every CAREC country electricity sector, until recently, was a vertically integrated, \npublicly owned monopoly.5,6 This arrangement has proven inefficient and imposed serious regulatory \nchallenges.  There  is  evidence  of  gathering  regional  momentum  to  tackle  the  inefficiencies \nassociated with the inherited sector structures. All member countries, except TAJ and UZB, have \nvertically unbundled their sectors into generation, transmission, and distribution components.7 This \npermits nonperforming companies to be targeted for improvements. AZE, KAZ, and MON have \ntargeted their distribution companies, privatizing management of some of them. KAZ has privatized \nmost of its power generation facilities, and has a competitive electricity wholesale market. The PRC \nis developing a wholesale market in the northeast region. Some sector officials in other CAREC \ncountries wish to emulate KAZ in developing wholesale markets. Initial reforms in TAJ and UZB took \nthe form of preparatory legal work, which cannot yield benefits without further economic changes. \n \n7.  A key problem in most CAREC countries is the high commercial losses and poor billing and \ncollection rates of distribution companies.8 In combination with low regulated tariffs, the problem has \nundermined cash flow in the power sector and crippled many utilities financially. This in turn limits \ntheir attractiveness as trading partners and has led to a deterioration of existing infrastructure and \ninability to finance new infrastructure. The quality of service has suffered, especially in rural and poor \nurban areas. Dilapidated transmission infrastructure also reduces the benefits of trade. \n \n8.  The weak commercial performance of the sector has seriously undermined the regulators. \nMost CAREC member countries are yet to achieve universal electricity consumption metering. Poor \nmetering,  billing,  and  collection  mean  that  regulated  tariffs  have  lost  considerable  traction  in \nallocating sector resources, as they are not relevant to consumers who are unmetered, improperly \nbilled, or do not pay their bills. Further, the inadequate cash flows in several members\u2019 power \nsectors are distributed between sector companies or subsidiaries in subjective and unpredictable \nways.  As  a  result,  tariffs  do  not  provide  relevant  economic  signals  to  producers  or  potential \ninvestors. While enforcement of proper commercial standards is a responsibility of the utilities' \nshareholders, the lack of such enforcement presents significant challenges to the regulator. \n \n9.  Rigid  industry  structures  and  the  entrenched  monopolies  they  sustain  are  stifling  the \ndevelopment of competition, both from domestic and international sources. Regional trade is a form \nof competition, and ADB and member countries have experienced significant setbacks in facilitating \npower trade when vertically integrated monopoly utilities are involved. Restructuring of these sectors \nis crucial for deeper regional trade. \n \n10.  Even where tariffs do retain traction, institutional weaknesses distort the price of domestically \nproduced energy away from its true economic cost, obscuring the true benefits of energy trade and \nconservation. In general, the relative price of domestic to imported energy is kept considerably \nbelow its true economic value, discouraging power trade. Energy prices are generally maintained at \nlevels too low to support financial cost recovery or optimal deployment of nonrenewable energy \n                                                 \n5 The following description of issues is drawn from information collected for the diagnostic review of regulatory approaches \nand challenges (DRRAC) report. \n6  The exception is the People\u2019s Republic of China, which began restructuring its power sector in the 1980s. \n7  Azerbaijan is somewhat exceptional, having kept transmission and generation in one publicly owned company. \n8 The DRRAC report found that 30\u201360 % of power is paid for at regulated prices in most CAREC countries. ", "3 \nresources over time.9 Distortionary cross subsidies between different consumer classes are also \ncommon.  Seasonal  prices  also  do  not  vary  adequately  to  permit  management  of  seasonal \nconstraints. The distortions demonstrate the need for regulatory improvement.  \n \n11.  Regulators in the region are committed to tariff rationalization. However, attempts to reform \ntariffs have been severely constrained by concerns regarding affordability of power. A clear and \nopen debate on the quality of service that the government is willing to support through explicit,      \nnondistortionary  subsidies  to  marginal  consumers  is  required  because  raising  tariffs  to  permit \nfinancial  cost  recovery  or  reflect  marginal  economic  costs  would  cause  significant  economic \nhardship  for  poorer  consumers,  especially  during  winter.  This  debate  will  require  inputs  from            \nwell-informed and articulate regulators, committed to balancing the needs of consumers and likely \nfuture investors. ADB supports a flexible approach to setting multipart tariffs that can facilitate tariff \nreforms while meeting social goals,10 which will underpin ADB\u2019s advice under CMERF. \n \n12.  Member regulators, utilities, and governments are eager to learn from the experiences of \ntheir neighbors in the region as they attempt to devise approaches that are suited to their own \neconomic and technical conditions, and objectives. Each approach involves regulatory issues and \nroles  that  must  be  considered  carefully  by  the  regulators  in  light  of  international  and  regional \nexperience.  \n \n13.  Finally, as each of these changes improves the financial position and economic signals \noperating in the sectors, regional trade will emerge as a least-cost solution to meeting electricity \ndemand, and returns to infrastructure investments will rise. Regulators will be required to facilitate \nsuch trade by harmonizing regulations, particularly those regarding use of the regional power grid. \n \n14.  ADB  has  included  a  loan  and  grant-funded  technical  assistance  for  power  sector \nrestructuring,11  billing,12  and  account  information  management13  in  TAJ;  assisted  with  the \nestablishment  of  the  State  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  in  the  PRC;14  and  has  included \nconditionalities regarding tariff reform and receivables in MON15 and TAJ.16 ADB has also attempted \nto stimulate regional power trade through the inclusion of a Power Trade Regional Agreement as a \ncondition  on  a  loan  to  TAJ  and  UZB,17  the  UZB  portion  of  which  was  recently  terminated. \nExperiences involving power trade suggest that domestic structural, commercial, and pricing reforms \nwill be crucial for catalyzing a genuine regional power market.18 \n \n15.  The DRRAC report finds that the degree of regulatory independence\u2014defined by the tenure \narrangements for regulators, funding for regulatory organizations, mandate to require information \nfrom utilities, and freedom to implement regulatory decisions\u2014varies across the region. So does the \n                                                 \n9  For information on tariff levels, see the DRRAC report. For information on tariff adequacy: World Bank. 2004.

Regulators that are required \nto serve the least objectives and have the most independence are generally found to be the most \nsuccessful in rationalizing tariffs.19 \n \n16.  There are three regional regulatory forums to which Asian countries belong: the South Asia \nForum for Infrastructure Regulation, an East Asian electricity regulators forum being established by \nthe  World  Bank,  and  the  Energy  Regulators  Regional  Association  (ERRA).  ERRA  has  been \ninstrumental in building regulatory capacity for sector reforms in East and Central Europe. Four \nCAREC  countries  (AZE,  KAZ,  KGZ,  and  MON)  attend  ERRA  meetings.  ERRA  facilitates \nharmonization  with  the  European  electricity  markets  and  caters  to  countries  with  established \nregulators. In the long term, as CAREC members establish independent regulators and undertake \nmajor reforms, CMERF's capacity-building role could be efficiently handled by ERRA. CMERF would \nbecome a coordinating council for developing regional power markets. Within CAREC, CMERF will \nreport to the SOM and serve as a regulatory focal point, permitting other funding agencies to pool \ninputs by attending CMERF meetings and advising on studies.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The intended impact of the regional TA is improved power sector regulation and regulatory \nsupport to sector reforms and power trade. The intended outcome is improved regulatory capacity in \nthe selected focus areas, reflecting a better understanding of the economic incentives created by \nregulatory decisions. The key outputs will be analyses of regionally relevant regulatory issues, \nagreement on principles for coordination on electricity regulation, capacity building, and a website. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n18.  A comparison of experiences among member countries and frequent consultation between \nregulators will enable capacity building. Given the similar circumstances a decade ago in most \nCAREC electricity sectors, and the diverse reforms undertaken since, proper comparative studies of \nthese reform efforts, interpreted in light of international best practice, offer a tremendous learning \nexperience for regulators. Because governments are actively debating important policy changes to \nbe implemented over the next few years, the scope for such information to stimulate and influence \nreforms is substantial. Activities under this TA will include preparation of the three regulatory studies, \ndevelopment of the CMERF website, and holding of CMERF\u2019s 2006 annual meeting. \n \n19.  There are two key assumptions for achieving the desired outcome: (i) governments nominate \nregulators or policy makers, not utility officials (who are the regulated entities), to participate in \nCMERF activities; and (ii) regulators have the interest and capacity to expand their strong technical \nknowledge base to learn about moderately complex economic issues. \n \n20.  At the 2005 CMERF meeting, regulators chose five study topics they wish to undertake for \nthe next year, and decided which countries would participate in each study. Three of the studies will \nbe funded by this TA, specifically: designing multipurpose tariff structures (TAJ), privatizing power \ndistribution companies (MON and KGZ), and creating a regional database of power utility costs (all \ncountries  participating  in  the  TA).  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  three  studies  are  in           \nAppendix 2. \n \n21.  The quality of the studies will depend on the provision of necessary information by member \nregulators, and the capacity of the study teams to translate international best practice and academic \n                                                 \n19 Kazakhstan\u2019s regulator is the most independent, and claims only one objective\u2500the promotion of competition. Its energy \npricing appears to be the most efficient in the region. ", "5 \nexpertise to the context of the region. The MOU establishing CMERF was approved by participating \nregulators in Beijing, endorsed by the CAREC SOM in October 2005, and will be signed by the \nCAREC MC in November 2005. Key risks in this regard include international tensions, and the \npossible perception by countries with more developed sectors that CMERF serves those who have \npursued reforms less vigorously. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $600,000  equivalent,  of  which  ADB  will  fund \n$500,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB's  TA  funding  program  (Appendix  3).  The  governments \nparticipating in the TA will provide office space, counterpart staff time, data, and other miscellaneous \nexpenses equivalent to $100,000. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  ADB will be the Executing Agency of the TA. The national regulatory agency from each \nmember  country  will  participate  in  (i)  selecting  relevant  study  topics,  (ii)  assisting  domestic \nconsultants with data gathering, (iii) obtaining data from utilities, (iv) discussing and doing analytical \nwork with study authors, and (v) presenting and discussing study findings. \n \n24.  Consulting requirements will include a total of 47 person-months of domestic consultant time \nto collect and verify numerical data and facts; and 12 person-months of international consultant time \nto supervise domestic consultants, analyze data in the context of international best practice in \neconomic regulation, and prepare the reports. Detailed time and expertise requirements are in \nAppendix 2. Individual consultants, including academics with expertise in power sector economics \nand engineering, will be utilized to ensure high levels of knowledge for the studies on tariffs and \nprivatization of distribution. A firm will be engaged to create the utility database. ADB staff will study \nmaterials recommended by the consultants, and monitor the draft study reports. The consultants will \nbe  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n \n25.  Outputs will be disseminated via the CMERF website, and shared directly with relevant \ngovernment  personnel  and  development  partners.  Quality  will  be  assessed  primarily  through \nmember and peer review. The outcome will be observed through the interactions with regulators \nduring and after study preparation, and the quality of regulatory decisions in its wake. \n \n26.  Implementation will start immediately after the MOU is signed at the Fourth CAREC MC in \nNovember 2005. Studies will be completed for the CMERF meeting in August 2006, and the TA will \nbe concluded in November 2006.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n27.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for the \nEstablishment of the CAREC Members Electricity Regulators Forum, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved power sector  Progress on some of the  \u2022  Sector monitoring by  \u2022  Study recommendations \nregulation and necessary  following:  resident missions  are implemented. \nregulatory support for  \u2022  New private  \u2022  ADB missions  \u2022  Current level of regulatory \nsector reforms and power  investment in member  \u2022  Reports from ADB  independence is at least \ntrade  power sectors  consultants in the field  maintained. \n  \u2022  Progress with vertical  \u2022  Information from   \nand horizontal  development partners   Risks \nunbundling  and discussions at  \u2022  Policy makers avoid \n\u2022  Greater choice of  CAREC meetings  structural changes. \nsuppliers\u2013domestic  \u2022  Reports by sector   \nand international  officials at CMERF \n\u2022  Reductions in the \nmost distortionary \nsubsidies \n\u2022  Real tariff increases \ntoward economically \nand/or financially \njustifiable levels \n\u2022  Cross-country \nharmonization of \nsector regulations \n \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nImproved regulatory  \u2022  Greater emphasis on  \u2022  Government decrees,    \u2022  Regulators show active \ncapacity in the selected  performance-based  ongoing interactions  with  interest in learning about \nfocus areas, due to better  regulation and other  sector officials, ADB  technical economic issues. \nunderstanding of the  incentive schemes to  missions, reports from   \neconomic incentives  allocate cash,  ADB consultants in the  Risks \ncreated by regulatory  approve tariffs, and  field, iInformation from   \ndecisions  encourage metering  development partners  \u2022  Governments nominate \n      utility representatives \n\u2022  Near-consensus in  \u2022  Ongoing interactions with  instead of regulators to join \nmost countries on the  regulators, ADB  CMERF. \nright regulatory  missions, reports from   \nprinciples for power  ADB consultants in the   \ntrade and foreign  field \ninvestment \n \nOutputs      Assumptions and Risks \n       \n1.

Outline terms of reference for three studies to be funded under this regional technical \nassistance are presented here: \n \nA.  Designing and Approving Efficient and Adequate Tariff Structures Appropriate to \nDifferent  Consumer  Categories,  and  Involving  Lifelines,  Reliability  Premiums, \nDiscounts for Prepayment, and/or Wattage Limitations \n  participating country: Tajikistan \n \n2.  Background. Three essential features of electricity markets can be usefully considered \ntogether  when  designing  regulations.  First,  consumers  have  different  capacities to  pay  for \nelectricity. Second, the electricity and heat systems are unable to meet demand during peak \ndemand periods. Third, consumers also differ with respect to their power system requirements, \nand tendency to pay their power bills. The first point means that regulators are required to \ndesign tariff structures that keep electricity affordable to the poor, while still allowing the system \nto recover its costs. The second means capacity constraints must be allocated in an orderly \nfashion for the system to function efficiently.   \n \n3.  The third feature permits flexible tariff structures to be applied cheaply, while improving \nefficiency. Specifically, different types of consumers can be offered different contracts, some of \nwhich will involve limitations on the wattage or energy they can draw, include clauses allowing \nthem to be cut off more frequently, or may require prepayment for electricity. In return for \naccepting such restrictions on the quality of supply, consumers could receive discounts or \nlifeline tariffs. Tajikistan is constrained with respect to the total electrical energy available during \nwinter, resulting in frequent load-shedding. This load-shedding is generally visited upon the \nsame  communities,  without  warning  or  compensation.  Regularizing  load-shedding,  and \npermitting  residential  neighborhoods  to  opt  for  cheaper  interruptible  power  schemes  could \ntherefore improve circumstances considerably. Similarly, significant problems in rectifying the \nbilling and collection system suggest that prepaid metering, which would largely eliminate the \nneed for billing and collections, might be an attractive option. Leaving aside the engineering \ndetails, this study will look at what tariff structures will need to be designed with these schemes. \n \n4.  For any scheme to work, that requires consumers to voluntarily sort themselves into \nconsumer groups, the scheme must be simple, and there must be a robust way of ensuring that \nthose who receive cheap electricity actually bear the quality restrictions. The best way to ensure \nthis is to design incentive-compatible contracts, wherein wealthier consumers would not wish to \nreceive the quality of power service on offer through the cheaper contract. The objective of this \nstudy  is  to  design  incentive-compatible  power  contracts  that  will  meet  social  goals,  while \npermitting recovery of some defined level of financial cost and offering consumers incentives to \nconserve power and electrical energy. \n \n5.  Discussions with the World Bank are under way, as the World Bank is undertaking a \nsimilar study in Mongolia, and useful comparisons can be drawn. \n \n6.  Outcome and Impact. The outcome of the study will be a learning experience that will \nteach member regulators how to segment markets to efficiently and affordably allocate scarce \nelectrical capacity and energy. The impact will be improved capacity to design and review such \npricing and market segmentation schemes. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \n \n7.  Consulting  Inputs.  This  study  has  the  following  consulting  requirements                   \n(person-months are in parentheses): international energy economist (3), domestic Tajikistan \npower sector specialist (5), domestic survey design expert (1), and 4 domestic enumerators for             \n1 month each (4). The international consultant will have a firm grasp of power system planning, \nexperience in developing countries, especially with working with primary data from developing \ncountries. The domestic power sector specialist will have a clear understanding of relations \nbetween Tajikistan\u2019s electricity supply companies and consumers, the constraints faced by \nconsumers in utilizing and paying for power, and consumer behavior given these constraints. \nThe  domestic  survey  design  expert  will  have  experience  in  collecting  survey  information \nregarding public utilities, and consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for services. An advanced degree in \nstatistics, survey research, applied economics, or a related field is required. The enumerators \nwill be fully capable of carrying out completed survey designs, and resolving problems directly \nwith the survey design expert. The consultants will be hired as individuals. \n \n8.  Scope. The study will examine the possibility of such schemes in Tajikistan. It will \nproceed in six stages: \n \n(i)  An international consultant, with the assistance of the regulators and domestic \nconsultants,  will  identify  from  existing  reports  the  constraints  on  the  power \nsystem  that  need  rationing  (load,  energy,  credit).  Attention  to  temporal  and \nspatial variation will be crucial. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is currently \nundertaking a staff study to assess the long-run marginal cost of power supply in \nTajikistan. Its findings will serve as the basis of discussions for designing Tajik \ntariffs in this study. \n(ii)  The regulators will provide inputs regarding their priorities in terms of social \nprotection, assist the consultants in evaluating alternative schemes and indicate \nthe costs that must be recovered. \n(iii)  The  domestic  survey  design  expert,  in  consultation  with  the  international \nconsultant,  will  design  a  survey  instrument  to  assess  different  types  of \nconsumers'  service  needs,  and  economic  willingness  to  accept  service \nrestrictions. The consultants will also identify candidate enumerators. The team \nof domestic consultants will then design a survey. \n(iv)  The domestic consultants will implement the survey. \n(v)  The international consultant will produce a report giving practical suggestions for \nproviding tariff support to the poor, while allocating constraints equitably. \n(vi)  The international expert will present the findings and recommendations at the \n2006  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Members \nElectricity Regulators Forum (CMERF) conference, followed by a dissemination \nworkshop in Tajikistan. \n \nB.  Possibilities and Pitfalls in Privatizing Distribution Company Management, \nparticipating countries: Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Mongolia, with assistance from \nKazakhstan \n \n9.  Background. State-owned distribution companies (DISCOs) in most CAREC countries \nare performing poorly. Auctioning of contracts for the private management of DISCOs has been \nidentified as a potential solution to the problem. Azerbaijan has awarded concessions on all four \nof  its  DISCOs  to  two  private  companies.  Kazakhstan  has  privatized  most  of  its  DISCOs. \nMongolia  has  privatized  one  DISCO,  and  is  considering  further  privatizations.  The  Kyrgyz \nRepublic is also considering privatizing some DISCOs. \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n \n10.  Any  contracting  arrangement  will  have  to  balance  the  needs  to  (i)  ensure  proper \npayment  of  generators  and  the  transmission  company,  (ii)  reduce  the  risk  to  investors  of \nregulatory inconsistencies, (iii) obtain a good price for the management contract, (iv) prevent \ncommercial  risks  being  passed  on  to  consumers  and  the  government,  (v)  leverage \nimprovements in reliability and service quality, (vi) ensure adequate transparency in the auction \nand contracting procedure, and (vii) predictably manage any necessary tariff adjustments. \n \n11.  Outcome and Impact. The study will build the capacity to help design and supervise the \nprivatization of DISCOs in the Kyrgyz Republic and Mongolia, drawing on the experience of \nAzerbaijan and Kazakhstan. Analysis of international experience will also facilitate capacity \nbuilding in Azerbaijan as it continues to work with its concessionaires to improve service quality \nand financial responsiveness.   \n \n12.  Consulting  Inputs.  This  study  has  the  following  consulting  requirements                 \n(person-months  are  in  parentheses):  team  leader\u2013international  economist/regulatory/        \npublic-utilities specialist (4), international legal expert (1), domestic Kyrgyz Republic power                        \nsector specialist (5), domestic Mongolia power sector specialist (5), domestic Azerbaijan power \nsector specialist (2); domestic Kazakhstan power sector specialist (2). The domestic consultants \nwill have extensive knowledge of institutional, business, and policy arrangements for power \nsector management in their respective countries. The two international experts will each have \nconsiderable  experience  designing  and/or  supervising  the  privatization  of  monopoly  public \nutilities, including those for energy. The services will be offered by a consulting firm. \n \n13.  Scope. This study will involve one DISCO in the Kyrgyz Republic and one publicly \nowned DISCO in Mongolia. It will proceed in five stages. \n \n(i)  An  assessment  of  the  commercial  performance,  management  practices,  and \ncorporate governance of the selected Kyrgyz and Mongolian DISCOs will be \nprepared by the regulator and the two respective domestic consultants, with \ninputs from the DISCO management and the international economist. With the \nassistance  of  the  domestic  consultants,  the  international  legal  expert  will \nappraise the legal basis for privatization. Case studies will be prepared covering \nfour or five privatizations of comparable DISCOs, focusing on the regulatory and \ncontractual frameworks utilized. Country studies will include those of Azerbaijan \nand Kazakhstan, and the respective domestic consultants will obtain necessary \ninformation in conjunction with the Azerbaijan Ministry of Energy and Industry, \nand the Kazakh regulator. The four domestic consultants will also plan study \ntours for the Kyrgyz and Mongolian regulators. \n(ii)  Two regulators each from the Kyrgyz Republic and Mongolia (four persons in \ntotal) will undertake a back-to-back study tour to Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, \naccompanied by the economist. A session will be held in Azerbaijan at which the \neconomist will highlight lessons learned from international case studies that have \nimplications for Azerbaijan\u2019s current problems with its DISCOs. Following the \ntour, the economist will visit the Kyrgyz Republic and Mongolia, and will hold \ndiscussions  with  regulators  and  other  officials  to  clarify  the  scope  of  their \nprivatization plans. \n(iii)  In consultation with the Kyrgyz and Mongolian regulators, the economist will draft \na sample road map for privatizing the participating DISCOs. The economist will \ndraft white papers laying out the principles that each privatization will have to \nfollow to balance the considerations listed in para. 10. The white paper should be \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \nsuitable for turning over to lawyers who could utilize them to craft actual requests \nfor tenders. The legal expert will advise on the preparation of the white papers to \nensure that they are suitable for that purpose. The economist will also write a \nfinal report. This report will include the sample road maps, white papers, case \nstudies,  and  chapters  outlining  the  background,  rationale,  scope,  regulatory \narrangements, legal requirements, and economic analysis of privatization plans \nfor the selected DISCOs in the Kyrgyz Republic and Mongolia. \n(iv)  The  domestic  consultants  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Mongolia  will  each \norganize  dissemination  workshops  in  the  city  where  the  targeted  DISCO  is \nlocated.  \n(v)  The  economist  will  hold  back-to-back  visits  to  each  country  to  hold  these \nworkshops. The economist will attend the CMERF conference in summer 2006 to \npresent and discuss study findings. \n \nC.  Costs and Input Requirements of Power Utilities across Member Countries \n14.  Background. Regulators that approve tariffs on reported costs must reach decisions on \nwhich costs submitted by the utility are reasonable. It is widely recognized that information \nasymmetry exists, and utilities do not always report costs accurately. It is also well accepted that \npublicly managed utilities do not always seek to minimize their costs. It is therefore vital for \nregulators to have a clear perception of just how much it costs to run a utility, and what kind of \nfuel  consumption,  other  technical  parameters,  and  electricity  losses  are  reasonable.  While \nconsumers should not pay for the inefficiency of utilities, any unreasonable expectation would \ndelay decisions related to tariff increases. Regional comparisons of operating norms at utilities \nare therefore extremely useful. \n \n15.  Introducing the notion of disclosure in most CAREC country power sectors is itself of \nvalue. \n \n16.  Outcome and Impact. This study will provide regulators with vital information that they \ncould use to ensure that utilities are given incentives to reduce costs to reasonable levels. The \noutput will be a searchable database in English and Russian posted on the CMERF website \nwith information relevant to making comparisons of allowable costs. In addition to the numbers, \nthe database will provide detailed information on the specific source of the data; the definitions \nand methods for calculating each piece of information; and information not disclosed, together \nwith reasons for nondisclosure where possible (e.g.: commercially privileged, national security \ninterest, data unmeasured). \n \n17.  Consulting Inputs. One international consultant working for 4 person-months will be \nrequired.  This  individual  consultant  will  be  a  power  engineer  with  experience  in  power \ngeneration, transmission and distribution, and supervising data collection. Experience in Central \nAsia  will  be  required.  Domestic  consultants  in  each  member  country  each  working  for                  \n3 person-months (21 person-months total) will be required to collect data. Each will have prior \nknowledge of the power sectors, a strong engineering background, and English proficiency. One \nRussian- and English-speaking domestic consultant, with sufficient capabilities in information \ntechnology (IT), will be required for an additional 2 months to prepare the database and launch \nit on the internet. The international consultant will be responsible for recruiting the domestic \nconsultants. \n \n18.  Scope. This activity will involve all six countries participating in the technical assistance. \nIt will include the assimilation of data on the national transmission grid, three DISCOs, and the \n ", "12  Appendix 2 \n10 most important generators in each country. In the People\u2019s Republic of China, information \ncan be limited to one regional market only. The study will proceed in four phases:  \n \n(i)  From existing documents and studies, the international consultant will familiarize \nhimself/herself with member countries\u2019 power sectors. In consultation with the \nregulators, the consultant will produce a list of measures required to assess \nreasonable power generation, transmission, and distribution costs. The list will \ninclude  specific  definitions,  as  well  as  detailed  instructions  for  domestic \nconsultants,  on  how  to  calculate  measures  and  record  data.  To  recruit  the \ndomestic consultants, the international consultant will hold telephone interviews \nto identify, in conjunction with the ADB project officer, suitable candidates. \n(ii)  The international consultant will visit the region to hold organizational meetings \nwith  the  domestic  consultants,  and  assess  the  scope  of  the  Project.  The \ndomestic consultants will then begin collecting data, referring all discrepancies \nand problems back to the international consultant, who will vet the data and \nensure that it is consistent and well documented. \n(iii)  The international consultant will supervise the local IT expert who will prepare the \ndatabase. The consultant will also prepare a brief report presenting the findings \nregarding  the  availability  and  reliability  of  data,  the  extent  and  nature  of \nexceptions to disclosure, and highlighting any comparisons across countries that \nthey, the regulators, or ADB project staff consider noteworthy. \n(iv)  The international consultant will attend the  2006 CMERF meeting to  present the \nstudy findings.\n ", "  Appendix 3  13 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n  Total \nItem  Cost \nA.
