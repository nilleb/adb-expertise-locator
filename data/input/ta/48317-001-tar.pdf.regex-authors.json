INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF) aims to scale up investments \nin urban climate change resilience (UCCR), especially for the urban poor, across 25 secondary \ncities in Asia.1 It prioritizes six developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB)\u2014Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Viet Nam2.  \n   \n2.  The proposed cluster regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) will make \nUCCRTF  resources  available  to  ADB\u2019s  operations  departments  to  provide  planning  and \ncapacity-building support as well as pilot activities for project development either before or \nduring project preparatory TA and at the initial stage of project implementation. The TA will \nsupport a range of activities to help lay the groundwork for UCCR planning processes, project \npipeline, and knowledge and capacity development. A concept paper prepared for the TA was \napproved by the Vice-President (knowledge management and sustainable development) on 16 \nDecember 2014.3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n3.  The  TA  will  contribute  to  the  strengthening  of  UCCR  in  selected  highly  vulnerable \nmedium-sized cities in the region and thereby foster ADB\u2019s 3E-approach.4 It is in line with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2020; ADB\u2019s Midterm Review Action Plan; the Urban Operational Plan; Environment \nOperations  Directions,  2013\u20132020;  and  the  Operational  Plan  for  Integrated  Disaster  Risk \nManagement, 2014\u20132020.5 Consultations have been held with eligible country governments \nincluding Bangladesh and Pakistan, and other relevant partners.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES   \n4.  Cities in Asia and the Pacific are particularly vulnerable to climate change, as people \nand economic assets are highly concentrated in hazard-prone locations. The 238 million Asian \nurban poor are expected to be hit first and hardest by the effects of climate change. Disasters \ncaused by natural hazards erase 1%\u20135% of gross domestic product each year.7 \n \n5.  More than 60% of the projected increase in urban population from 2010 to 2050 will take \nplace in Asia, and half of that growth will occur in medium-sized cities.8 These cities will make \nsignificant  decisions  on  planning,  land  use,  and  major  investment  projects  in  the  coming \ndecades to support economic growth and to generate livelihoods for growing populations. \n \n6.  Urban areas that are most susceptible to climate-related shocks and stresses have \nfragile  systems,  including  fragile  natural  ecosystems  and  large  socially  or  economically \n                                                \n1  Urban resilience is the capacity of cities to function, so that the people living and working in cities, particularly the \npoor and the vulnerable, survive and thrive no matter what stresses or shocks they encounter. \n2  Additional countries will be considered in consultation with UCCRTF fund donors and operations department.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 February 2015. \n4  Integrated environmental (green), equity (inclusive), and economic (competitive) approach. \n5  ADB. 2008.

Yet, the complexity of today\u2019s cities\u2014rapidly growing and evolving in \nresponse to community and business demands\u2014makes system failure difficult to predict.9 \n \n7.  As well as physical and spatial challenges, important policy and institutional challenges \nare presented by agencies working across sectors, administrative boundaries, and multisector \ndecision  making.  These  are  more  daunting  because  of  weaknesses  in  local  government \nunderstanding and awareness of climate-induced impacts, and interface with urban environment \nplanning. Governance and institutional capability are critical to addressing these challenges. \n  \n8.  The uncertainty of what future cities will look like, and how urban systems will perform in \nthe face of disruption, has created demand for a new approach that includes hard and soft \ninfrastructure, policies, institutions, and ecosystems. Moving beyond efforts to make single \npieces of infrastructure more durable in the face of changing climate risk, UCCR considers the \nability of urban systems to withstand the impacts and maintain function in the face of climate-\ninduced  disruption.  Urban  resilience  focuses  on  seven  qualities:  flexibility,  robustness, \nredundancy, reflectiveness, resourcefulness, integration, and inclusiveness.10 \n \n9.  Key  drivers  to  strengthen  UCCR  are  (i)  the  ability  of  urban  systems,  including  key \ninfrastructure, to maintain function in the face of climate-induced disruption; (ii) enabling peer \nlearning  within  cities  and  across  countries  by  engaging  decision  makers  and  vulnerable \npopulations in how to manage changes in climate, and sharing experiences to identify critical key \nareas of planning, investment, and management;11 (iii) involvement of multiple stakeholder and \nchampions less subject to political cycles\u2014research institutions, think tanks, civil society, and \nlocal businesses;12 (iv) considering the roles that women can play in resilience planning and the \ndifferent extents to which households and communities are vulnerable to natural hazards and \nsystem failure; and (v) alignment and coalition of efforts among donors and financing partners.13 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n10.  The TA will support capacity development in preparing and responding to climate change-\ninduced shocks and stresses in secondary cities. It will support policy dialogues, capacity building, \nand institutional strengthening to improve planning and other mechanisms to strengthen UCCR, \nand  support  national  and  regional  partnerships.  Activities  are  expected  to  influence  country \npartnership strategies and urban development projects to adopt UCCR principles and approaches. \n \n11.  The TA will draw lessons from RETA 6293 Managing the Cities in Asia and RETA 7918 \nSupport to Urban Infrastructure Development and Financing, both supporting urban infrastructure, \nincluding low carbon, climate resilient infrastructure as key areas of urban development. \n \n12.  A regional approach is justified because (i) cities in ADB\u2019s DMCs often face common \nchallenges or limitations that either require cooperation to resolve them or they can more efficiently \nbe addressed through pooling of resources and sharing of knowledge; (ii) programs to strengthen \nurban resilience can provide shared benefits, as good spillovers exist in terms of how to address \n                                                \n9  J. da Silva, S.

Regional cooperation initiatives can help address UCCR at a regional scale, complementing \nthe focus of the TA on resilient city systems. \n  \n13.  The  cluster  approach  is  proposed  because  (i)  subprojects  are  closely  related,  with \ncommon objectives and significant potential synergies; (ii) subprojects will operate collectively \nas a pilot for strengthening resilient urban development; and (iii) a cluster modality will maximize \nTA coherence and coordination better than an individual TA approach. This will allow ADB\u2019s \noperations departments to be more responsive to the timing of DMCs\u2019 planning cycles and \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategies for these DMCs, while reducing costs otherwise devoted to \nprocessing individual subprojects as stand-alone TA projects. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact will be that urban populations, especially the urban poor in selected DMC \ncities, are less vulnerable to the direct and indirect impacts of climate change. The outcome will \nbe increased application of UCCR principles in selected DMC cities. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The cluster TA will build on a range of ADB experience, particularly that of ADB\u2019s \noperations departments, in supporting capacity development for climate change responses as \nwell as green, inclusive, and competitive cities. It will support urban climate risk, vulnerability, \nand system assessments to guide policy makers and communities in strengthening UCCR. It \nwill  assist  governments  and  civil  society  with  better  scientific  and  economic  data  at  the \nsubnational level to assist decision making and provide support for project development and \npilot activities. Participating governments and cities will be able to identify UCCR strategies, \nbuild  related  institutional  capacity,  and  enable  multi-stakeholder  engagement  to  implement \nUCCR initiatives and to assess the local impacts of climate change. \n \n16.  Based on the UCCRTF implementation criteria and operations department consultation, \nBangladesh, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Viet Nam have been \nidentified for inclusion in the subprojects. The process of city selection, to be finalized during TA \nimplementation, includes the following criteria: (i) vulnerability of urban poor and urban system, \n(ii)  government  buy  in,  (iii)  local  capacity  and  ownership,  (iv)  operations  department \ncommitment, and (v) synergies through partnerships. Selection criteria for cities and activities \nare in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n17.  The TA will have three subprojects, to be carried out in close coordination with ADB\u2019s \noperations departments: \n(i)  Subproject 1: Integrated urban development plans are developed in selected \ndeveloping  member  country  cities  incorporating  urban  climate  change \nresilience principles. Subproject 1 will support ADB\u2019s operations departments to \nintegrate UCCR planning principles into the ADB project cycle. A guideline for the \nintegration of UCCR into integrated urban development plans will be developed. \nUCCR experts will join project teams in the early stage to prepare UCCR inputs to \nintegrated  urban  development  plans,  which  (a)  include  assessments  of \nsocioeconomic  vulnerability,  climate  risk,  and  urban  systems;  (b) provide  an \noverview of UCCR issues and their relevance in the urban context; (c) develop \naction plans that respond to climate risks on critical urban systems; and (d) identify \nfeasible soft and hard infrastructure projects to build UCCR. \n ", "4  \n(ii)  Subproject 2: Targeted cities network to share knowledge and build capacity \nthrough peer learning and joint training activities. Subproject 2 will strengthen \nparticipating  DMCs\u2019  and  development  practitioners\u2019  capacity  to  apply  UCCR \nknowledge to development planning. To address gaps in UCCR knowledge and \nidentify existing centers of excellence where new knowledge can be exchanged, it will \n(a) conduct an institutional analysis at the national and local government levels for \nparticipating DMCs and cities to understand capabilities, and address institutional \ngaps; (b) assess the state of knowledge and practice, and address knowledge gaps \nto enhance UCCR at the project level; (c) identify replicable practices; and (d) identify \nopportunities for cross-regional exchange, including training and workshops to share \nknowledge, city exchange activities to enable peer learning, and the production and \ndissemination of knowledge outputs to advance UCCR.14 To strengthen UCCRTF \nmonitoring, the subproject will (a) establish an annual monitoring regime that collects \nand collates data from cities, pilot activities, projects, and knowledge activities; and \n(b) develop annual reports that measure progress against the overall baseline in \nUCCRTF-supported cities. \n(iii)  Subproject  3:  Development  of  pilot  activities  and  project  development \nsupport.  Subproject  3 will  provide  resources for pilot  interventions  and  project \ndevelopment, which will help integrate UCCR into projects that are at risk from \nclimate change, and seek to build more resilient urban systems. These funds will \nenable a diverse range of city stakeholders, including government and civil society \norganizations,  to  build  their  capacity  and  participate  in  the  design  of  inclusive, \nintegrated,  and  iterative  approaches  to  project  development  as  well  as  action \nresearch which tests new approaches to building UCCR. In consultation with ADB\u2019s \noperations departments, the subproject will identify opportunities for pilot projects to \nsupport  planning  and  investment  activities  being  implemented  by  operations \ndepartments. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $15 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nUrban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund15 under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility \nand administered by ADB.16 A possible TA amount increase through additional allocation from \nthe UCCRTF may be considered in the future subject to resource availability, implementation \nprogress, and UCCRTF approval. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB's Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD) will be the executing \nagency of the TA. Upon TA approval, the subproject proposals will be submitted for approval to \nthe director general, RSDD, in accordance with ADB guidelines on cluster TA processing. RSDD's \nSector Advisory Services Division, through the Urban Sector Group, will be managing the TA. The \nimplementing agencies for the TA will comprise the urban sector divisions of ADB\u2019s regional \ndepartments\u2014Central and West Asia Department, South Asia Department, and Southeast Asia \nDepartment. The TA will finance consulting services; workshops and training, including resource \npersons; pilot activities; report preparation and communications; miscellaneous administration and \nsupport costs; and equipment and surveys. Confirmation of no objection will be obtained from \n                                                \n14 Knowledge products will be focused on methodologies for measuring resilience and avoided loss, may be based on \ncase studies and learn from decisions on planning, accountability, governance, construction standards, etc. \n15 Financing partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States. \n16 The UCCRTF was formally approved on 3 December 2013. Fund allocation was secured on 17 November 2014. \n ", "  5\nparticipating DMCs before any activities financed by the TA commence in those DMCs. The TA \nand its subprojects are expected to be implemented from April 2015 to December 2021. \n \n20.  The TA will coordinate its activities with other ongoing ADB projects through existing \ninstitutional  arrangements  such  as  the  Climate  Change  Coordination  and  Disaster  Risk \nManagement Unit, other sector groups, and the Cities Development Initiative for Asia. Under the \nTA, knowledge partnerships with centers of excellence will be established to improve project \ndesign and delivery, and to ensure that knowledge emerging from the UCCRTF is shared with \nkey  stakeholders  in  the  region.17 All  subprojects  will  be  supported  by  ADB\u2019s  operations \ndepartments, and activities will be closely coordinated with them. \n \n21.  The input of 401 person-months of international consultants and 364 person-months of \nnational consultants is envisaged. Resource persons will be engaged on an individual basis. \nDifferent methods of consultant selection will apply, depending on the size and nature of the \ncontracts. Consultants may be engaged via consulting firm(s) or individually. The consultants will \nbe engaged using procurement modalities: quality- and -cost-based selection using a technical\u2013\nfinancial ratio of 90:10, quality-based selection, consultant qualification selection, or fixed budget \nselection,  as  appropriate.  All  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Annual audit reports \nwill  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  UCCRTF  implementation  guidelines.  An  indicative \nprocurement plan is in Supplementary Appendix B. The outline terms of reference for consultants \nfor subprojects are in Appendix 3. \n \n22.  All procurement under the TA will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time).All equipment procured for pilot and project \n \ndevelopment in countries and cities will be turned over to the respective government partners at \nthe  end  of  each  project.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nE.  Governance \n23.  Due diligence and capacity assessment has been done under the UCCRTF selection of \nits six priority countries. The core TA implementation team will consist of dedicated staff, technical \nstaff,  secondees18,  and  consultants  with  UCCR  expertise.  The  core  team  will  regularly \ncommunicate with subproject teams, ADB\u2019s operations departments, and UCCRTF financing \npartners; organize meetings; and prepare reports required for ADB and partners. The TA will be \nmonitored through assessment of quality and timely delivery of outputs. Overall TA results will be \ndisseminated through regional forums, the Urban Sector Group, and UCCRTF donor meetings. A \nclear road map of activities will be developed, monitored, and evaluated to achieve the outputs. \nThe TA fund flow arrangement is in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \nIV.
