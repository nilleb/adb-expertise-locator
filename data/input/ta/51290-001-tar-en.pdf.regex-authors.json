The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the  proposed \nRevitalization of Informal Settlements and their Environments using a Water-Sensitive Approach \n(RISE) Projects will be undertaken in Makassar city, Indonesia and in the Greater Suva Area \n(GSA),  Fiji.1 The  TA  will  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  a  water-sensitive  approach  for \nwastewater  treatment,  flood  risk  reduction,  and  urban  environment  improvement  using \ndecentralized  green  infrastructure  to  biologically  treat  contaminated  and  polluted  water. \nExperiences and lessons from the project activities undertaken through the TA are expected to \ninform the technical design, implementation arrangements, and cost estimates for larger-scale \ninterventions that may be undertaken by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) through investment \nprojects. The TA will build on the preparatory work undertaken through the knowledge partnership \nwith the Cooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities.2 \n \n2.  The RISE3 program is a 5-year research project with five components that work together \nto achieve the program\u2019s objectives: design and engagements, ecology and environment, human \nhealth, well-being, and policy and investment. Support to RISE was identified through ADB\u2019s TA \nfor Establishing the Future Cities Program in the Asia and Pacific Region,4 which included the \npreparation of an urban diagnostic report for Suva and support to the Neighborhood Upgrading \nand Shelter Project in Makassar. The TA is included in the 2018\u20132019 work plan of the ADB \nUrban Sector Group.5 The TA complements work undertaken within the framework of the RISE \nprogram that will build demonstration sites. More specifically, the TA will provide the design and \ndocument results of civil works that will be implemented by host governments through alternative \nfunding sources.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Asia and the Pacific is the most rapidly urbanizing region in the world. As cities provide \nmore economic opportunities, a growing proportion of urban populations are forced to live in \ninformal settlements with inadequate infrastructure and limited or no access to basic services. \nThe conventional approach of large-scale centralized trunk infrastructure typically fails to service \nlower-income and informal areas, which often have insecure land tenure. \n \n4.  In Indonesia, 22% of the urban population live in informal settlements. Makassar, the \nadministrative capital of South Sulawesi province and the country\u2019s fifth largest city with a \npopulation of 1.8 million, has 58,268 households living in informal settlements.6 The population \n                                                \n1  The GSA comprises Suva city and three municipal towns: Lami, Nasinu, and Nausori. \n2  The Cooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities, established in July 2012, is registered as a charity and \nis funded by the Government of Australia and industry partners. Its purpose is to help change the way cities and \ntowns are designed, built, and managed by valuing the contribution water makes to economic development and \ngrowth, quality of life, and the ecosystems of which cities are a part. \n3 RISE is an action research program working at the intersections of health, environment, water, and sanitation. \nhttps://www.rise-program.org/.The program was granted \u00a310m from the Wellcome Trust a UK based philanthropic \norganization \n4  ADB. 2015.

Cities and Climate Change Initiative: Climate Change \nVulnerability  Assessment.  Makassar.  http://www.fukuoka.unhabitat.org/programmes/ccci/pdf/Climate_Change_ \nVulnerability_Assessment.pdf. \n \n ", "2 \ndensity of Makassar is about 8,200 persons per square kilometer but is significantly higher in \ninformal settlements.7 With a low-lying and flat topography and a high-water table, groundwater \nis accessible but susceptible to contamination. Inland and coastal flooding occurs in many parts \nof Makassar and the city is vulnerable to climate change impacts. Lack of formal tenure constrains \nextension of services to these areas. The TA will complement an ongoing ADB project that is \nhelping 20 large and medium-sized towns (including Makassar) in Indonesia to upgrade basic \nfacilities and services in poor neighborhoods and establish new settlements for poor families \nthrough public\u2013private partnerships.8 \n \n5.  About 72% of Makassar has access to water from the Indonesian regional water utility \ncompany, Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum, but most residents, industry, and commerce also use \ngroundwater as a supplementary water source. Lack of adequate distribution infrastructure and \nabout 30% leakage in the existing distribution network restrict the availability and quality of water \nreaching end users. There have also been reports of salinization of groundwater in coastal areas, \nwhich may indicate potential over extraction.9 \n \n6.  Sanitation is estimated to cover 85% of Makassar\u2019s area. The sanitation system in \nMakassar consists of black water (toilet water) discharged to septic tanks and pits on individual \nproperties, and grey water (wastewater from bathrooms, kitchens, and laundries) discharged to a \nnetwork of open storm water drains. In many cases, septic tank effluent is also discharged into \nstorm water drains.10 The households in the target sites use untreated contaminated groundwater \nfor water supply. The area suffers from poor drainage and frequent flooding, which increases the \nvulnerability of the local population, especially children, to waterborne diseases. \n \n7.  An estimated 29% of Fiji\u2019s national population of approximately 256,000 people reside \nwithin the GSA, and around 44,000 of these people live in 86 informal settlements. In 2013, only \n36% of the GSA\u2019s urban population was covered by its existing sewerage infrastructure.11 Most \ninformal settlements within the GSA are not yet connected to the network because of the high \ncapital cost.12 Informal settlements are often characterized by poor management of wastewater \nand poor drainage, while tidal inundation and flooding are of concern. Fiji is vulnerable to health \nimpacts of climate change because of its small geographical size, exposure to extreme climate \nevents, and a small economy that depends largely on natural resources. Constrained land \navailability in the GSA and in Fiji are complex and have impacted the pace of urban development \nand provision of core services such as water supply and sanitation to informal settlement areas. \nThe households in the project site in Fiji have access to city water that is clean and reliable, but \nthey use rudimentary septic tanks. The area has very poor drainage. \n \n8.  The water-sensitive approach is an alternative solution to network infrastructure, which \nwill enable vulnerable communities to leapfrog traditional trunk connections and gain earlier \naccess to essential water-related services, while achieving improved environmental conditions \n                                                \n7  Government of Indonesia.

", "  3 \nand public health, greater climate resilience, and strengthened community capacity to manage \ntheir own infrastructure. The target projects in Makassar and the GSA will showcase the water-\nsensitive approach for wastewater treatment and urban environment improvement.  \n \n9.  The target sites in each of the cities were selected through a multicriteria analysis carried \nout by the governments in consultation with ADB. The following parameters were included: (i) the \ninformal settlement is recognized and prioritized by the city government, (ii) households hold proof \ndocuments indicating tenure, (iii) the settlement is vulnerable to climate change impacts, (iv) \nhouseholds are willing to participate in the project, (v) the geophysical layout of the settlement is \nsuitable  for  the  proposed  water-sensitive  approach  for  wastewater  treatment  and  urban \nenvironment improvement, and (vi) there is no resettlement involved. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: climate resilience, social, economic, and \npublic health conditions in informal settlements improved.13 The TA will have the following \noutcome:  access  to  essential  water-related  service  provisions  in  selected  informal  site \nsettlements in Makassar and GSA improved.14  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Appropriate water-sensitive design generated. Using participatory design \ninvolving members of the two project site communities in Makassar and the GSA, the TA will \ndesign specific water infrastructure: rainwater harvesting; wastewater treatment and recycling; \nnontrunk community-based sanitation; nature-based water treatment; and drainage, flood, and \ntidal inundation controls. \n \n12.  Output 2: Capacity for operation and maintenance of water-sensitive infrastructure \ndeveloped. The water-sensitive infrastructure will be installed, operated, and maintained in target \nsite households in Makassar and the GSA through parallel funding by other RISE partners. The \nTA will facilitate the participation of members of the community and other stakeholders at all \nstages of the project. To ensure the sustainability and establish the replicability of the projects, \nthe TA will provide capacity building on operation and maintenance of the installed water-sensitive \ncommunity infrastructure to the beneficiary communities, governments, and other stakeholders in \nMakassar and the GSA. \n \n13.  Output 3: Knowledge to inform the scaling up of the projects generated. The TA \napproach will allow the testing of innovative solutions in Makassar and the GSA. The results from \nthis  project  will  be  captured  in  a  report  that  will  inform  technical  design,  implementation \narrangements, and cost estimates for potential similar interventions undertaken by ADB in its \nlending operations. \n \n                                                \n13 Government  of  Indonesia.  2014.

Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $525,000, of which (i) $196,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund,15 and (ii) $329,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Urban Environmental Infrastructure Fund,16 both under the Urban \nFinancing Partnership Facility administered by ADB. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.  The  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change \nDepartment will implement the TA through coordination with ADB\u2019s Indonesia Resident Mission \nand Pacific Subregional Office in Suva. The main activities will be carried out by the Monash \nSustainable Development Institute (MSDI).17 The implementation arrangements are summarized \nin the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  October 2018\u2013December 2020 \nperiod \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank \nImplementing agencies  Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department \nPacific Department through Pacific Subregional Office in Suva and \nSoutheast Asia Department through Indonesia Resident Mission \nConsultants   To be selected and engaged by ADB \nSingle source selection   MSDI to be recruited  $500,000 \nby ADB as design \nand implementation \nmanagement \nconsultant \nIndividual consultants  As required   $25,000 \n(recruited by ADB,    \n5 person-months)  \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, amended from time to \ntime). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MSDI = Monash Sustainable Development Institute, TA = technical assistance, \nUCCRTF = Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund, UEIF = Urban Environmental Infrastructure Fund. \nNote: The TA is funded by two funding sources (the UCCRTF and UEIF), and these are clearly differentiated given that \nall activities (consulting services and procurement) in Makassar will be funded by the UCCRTF and all activities in the \nGreater Suva Area will be funded by the UEIF. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n                                                \n15 Financing partners are the Rockefeller Foundation and the Governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \nApplication to use funds under the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund and the Urban Environmental \nInfrastructure Fund for the TA was approved in December 2017. \n16 Financing partner is the Government of Sweden. \n17 The MSDI is part of Monash University and transacts business under the legal institutional structure of Monash \nUniversity, registered as an Australian charity and nonprofit organization. ", "  5 \n16.  Consulting  services.  ADB  will  engage  the  MSDI  as  design  and  implementation \nmanagement consultant using single source selection method because  \n(i)  the MSDI leads the RISE program within Monash University with which this TA is \naligned;  \n(ii)  the MSDI hosts the program management team, overseen by the RISE leadership \nand  executive  teams,  who  is  essential  to  the  cohesion,  governance,  and \nimplementation of the project;  \n(iii)  the MSDI brought together 20 partner institutions specifically in relation to their \nexpertise in this field, including Melbourne Water, South-East Water, Water Aid, \nand Oxfam (these partners are contributing their skills and experience to deliver \nthe project or assignment);  \n(iv)  the MSDI has strong in-country teams in Suva and Makassar, which include 30 \nFijian and Indonesian national staff employed as architects, engineers, planners, \ncommunity fieldworkers, and gender specialists under the MSDI; and  \n(v)  since August 2017, the MSDI has led community engagement activities, formed \nstrong community partnerships, and facilitated the establishment of community \nengagement committees in both target sites.18  \n \n17.  Overall, the MSDI has unique expertise, knowledge, and experience of this emerging and \ninnovative area of water-sensitive designs and is ideally suited to work with ADB under the TA. \nThe overall objective of the consulting services will be to provide management support in the \ndesign, implementation, operation, and maintenance of the water-sensitive infrastructure to be \ndeveloped in the two cities. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions \nand/or staff instructions.19 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) administering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent \nof $196,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund \nunder the Urban Financing Partnership Facility to the Government of Indonesia, and (ii) ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $329,000 to be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Urban  Environmental  Infrastructure  Fund  under  the  Urban  Financing \nPartnership Facility to the Government of Fiji for the Revitalization of Informal Settlements and \ntheir Environments using a Water-Sensitive Approach, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n                                                \n18 RISE. 2017.
