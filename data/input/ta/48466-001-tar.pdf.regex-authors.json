INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) aims to support the Government of Indonesia in \nenhancing the regulatory framework for financial sector development and its oversight at the \nnewly established Financial Sector Agency (OJK) and at the Ministry of Finance (MOF).1 The \noversight of the financial sector in Indonesia entered a new phase with the establishment of the \nOJK in 2011, which is now responsible for regulating the financial sector; the MOF has taken on \na new role as the policy maker for financial sector development. The TA will support the \ngovernment  in  the  implementation  of  Subprogram  2  triggers  of  the  Financial  Market \nDevelopment and Inclusion Program (FMDIP).2 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the \ngovernment  agreed  on  the  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference for consultants. The design and \nmonitoring framework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Indonesia\u2019s financial sector remains small compared with its regional peers. In \n2013, the financial sector assets (bank credit, market capitalization, and bonds) represented \n103% of gross domestic product compared with about 194% for the Philippines and over 300% \nfor Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. Moreover, the ratio of financial sector assets to gross \ndomestic product has remained relatively constant in Indonesia since 2010, indicating that \nfinancial  sector  deepening,  especially  the  creation  of  a  more  liquid  and  lower-cost  capital \nmarket, has remained a challenge since the end of the global financial crisis. In addition to being \nunderdeveloped, Indonesia\u2019s financial sector is not inclusive, and thus poses a development \nproblem. In 2014, only 21.9% of the poorest 40% of the Indonesian population had savings at a \nfinancial institution and over 40% of the population did not borrow, with only 13.1% having \nborrowed from a financial institution.3 Among those who did not borrow, 60% said they were not \nconsidered creditworthy, which suggests that the financial services provided may not be suitable \nfor all segments of society. In addition, while a sizable percentage of those who did not save \ncited lack of resources and employment as contributing factors, 7% said they either do not \nunderstand financial services or see a benefit from them. Promoting financial inclusion and \nfinancial literacy can address this challenge, as increasing basic savings and investments\u2014\nespecially among the poorest population\u2014could raise income levels and reduce gaps in income \ndistribution. \n3.  Capacity development of OJK, as the new financial regulator, is needed. The OJK \nlaw, which was approved in 2011, established the OJK as the unified financial regulator. In its \nnew role, OJK needs to develop the technical and regulatory capacity for an independent and \nunified regulator to (i) strengthen the regulatory structure for financial stability, (ii) deepen the \nfinancial market, and (iii) enhance access to financial services. More specifically, on financial \nsector stability, there needs to be an effective coordination between the government and OJK. \nAn effective coordination will improve information sharing, which can help to address financial \nstability issues in a timely and coordinated manner. In deepening the financial market, OJK will \nneed to support an enabling environment that is conducive to financial sector development. \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the website of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \non 25 September 2015. \n2  ADB. 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loan \nfor Subprogram 1 to the Republic of Indonesia for the Financial Market Development and Inclusion Program. \nManila. \n3  Statistics are based on the 2014 Global Financial Inclusion Database, which can be compared over a time series. \nOther databases may contain different statistics depending on the methodology adopted. \n ", "2 \n \nSuch OJK\u2019s support can be the adoption of international standards. For increasing financial \ninclusion, OJK can improve access to financial services by improving financial literacy and \nstrengthening consumer protection. \n4.  Adoption of international standards will strengthen OJK\u2019s regulatory capacity. \nThese include standards recommended by the Financial Stability Board country peer review.4 In \n2014, OJK signed the Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Consultation and \nCooperation and the Exchange of Information, thus becoming a full member of the International \nOrganization of Securities Commissions.  OJK is also committed to coordinate with and build \ncapacities of nonfinancial sector authorities such as the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, \nwhich is responsible for company registration. OJK also joined the Islamic Financial Services \nBoard\u2014the  international  standard-setting  body  for  Islamic  banking,  capital  market,  and \ninsurance based on Islamic finance principles.  \n5.  Ministry of Finance established a new Center on Financial Sector Policy under \nMOF\u2019s Fiscal Policy Agency (BKF). Their functions are to (i) develop policies for the financial \nsector, and (ii) coordinate financial sector development across the government and OJK. The \ngovernment\u2019s coordination function is particularly important for reforms that involve multiple \nstakeholders, such as (i) financial inclusion; and (ii) development of Islamic finance and capital \nmarket  products,  including  policies  regarding  tax  treatment  of  these  instruments.  The \ngovernment  also  set  up  the  Financial  Sector  Stability  Forum  (FKSSK)  to  promote  better \ncoordination and information sharing during normal times and times of distress or crisis, and to \nimplement  crisis  management  protocol.  Each  member  of  the  FKSSK  is  responsible  for \ndeveloping a standard operating procedure, which will support the FKSSK\u2019s crisis management \nprotocol  system.  BKF, as  the  secretariat  of the  FKSSK,  needs to  strengthen  its capacity, \nparticularly with regard to coordinating implementation of the standard operating procedures for \nmembers of the FKSSK. The TA will support the government in these areas.  \n6.  Financial inclusion is a priority for the government and OJK. Enhancing access to \nfinancial services will require the government and the OJK to improve the financial inclusion \nregulatory framework  and  educate  different segments  of  society  on  the  importance  of  the \nfinancial  system.  The  TA  will  implement  some  financial  inclusion  initiatives  related  to  the \nimplementation  of  the  FMDIP  Subprogram  2  policy  triggers.  These  initiatives  include  the \nfollowing: (i) improvement in the regulatory framework for financial inclusion; (ii) improvement of \nthe methodology of the OJK\u2019s financial literacy surveys and development of a database for \nfinancial  literacy;  (iii)  establishment  of  a  system  that  can  monitor  and  supervise  500,000 \nmicrofinance institutions across Indonesia; (iv) improvement in branchless banking initiatives by \nexpanding geographical coverage and the number of services provided; and (v) establishment \nof a knowledge sharing platform for better coordination and promotion of knowledge sharing, \nparticularly among microfinance institutions in Indonesia as well as other countries. Moving \nforward,  both  the  government  and  OJK  need  to  implement  Indonesia\u2019s  National  Financial \nInclusion Strategy and improve the effectiveness of some of the country\u2019s financial inclusion \nprograms. A follow-up TA project will be prepared for dedicated financial inclusion work to \npromote engagement on financial inclusion in FMDIP Subprogram 3 and beyond. \n \n7.  ADB has been a developing partner on Indonesia\u2019s financial sector development. \nADB has undertaken six major financial sector operations in Indonesia since 1998 aimed at \naddressing banking, capital markets, contractual savings, and reform of regulatory structure and \noversight. One of the most significant financial sector reforms was the creation of the OJK as a \n                                                \n4  Financial Stability Board. 2014. Peer Review of Indonesia: Review Report. Basel. \n ", "3 \n \nunified and independent regulator. The establishment of the OJK can be traced to 1999 when, \nfollowing policy dialogue between the government and ADB, Parliament passed the Banking \nLaw  to  insulate  the  financial  sector  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework  from  political \ninterference. In 2000, the government asked ADB to support the development of a blueprint for \nan  integrated  financial  services  supervisory  institution.  ADB  responded  with  the  Financial \nGovernance and Social Security Reform Program of 2002, supporting the implementation of \nnonbank  financial  sector  reform,  establishing  the  OJK,  and  amending  relevant  laws  and \nregulations.5 Due to the 1997\u20131999 Asian financial crisis and concerns about the transition from \nseveral regulators into one, the People\u2019s Consultative Assembly postponed the establishment of \nthe OJK from  2002  to 2010. This  postponement  enabled  ADB  to  continue  supporting  the \ngovernment with policy advice and capacity building through a series of programs and TA \nprojects, including a capital market development program and TA grant in 2007, the FMDIP, and \nassociated TA projects which focused on the capital market and nonbank financial institutions.6 \n \n8.  Lessons from ADB\u2019s previous operations include: (i) financial market development is \ncomplex  and  involves  major  changes  to  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  institutional \narrangements, and human capacity; it should therefore be guided through a medium- to long-\nterm strategy; (ii) financial sector supervision requires strong coordination between the regulator \nand the government and is best achieved through consensus building and an agreed financial \nsector  master  plan;  (iii)  capital  market  development  needs  to  be  coupled  with  reforms  to \nincrease access to financial services, including through services such as branchless banking, to \nimprove financial inclusion for the poor; and (iv) donor coordination is important to avoid any \noverlapping activities. On the last lesson, ADB has coordinated well with other development \npartners,  including  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  the  World  Bank,  and  Australia\u2019s \nDepartment of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be improved resiliency and stability of Indonesia\u2019s financial system, and \nexpanded access to financial services for all. The impact is aligned with the government priority \nas reflected in the National Medium Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019. The outcome will be \na regulatory system for integrated supervision, adoption of international standards, and a more \ninclusive financial sector created. The government and OJK will introduce a number of policies \nto deepen the financial sector and increase financial inclusion.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will continue to deepen the reforms under the FMDIP. ADB will provide support \nto the government (through the BKF) and OJK through clearly segregated funding that will be \nadministered by each entity. Support for the BKF will increase the agency\u2019s capacity to (i) serve \nas a cross-governmental financial sector development coordination body; (ii) improve its policy-\nmaking capacity on financial sector development with a focus on nonbank financial institutions, \nIslamic finance, and financial inclusion; and (iii) provide vital support to the MOF as a member of \nthe FKSSK. These efforts will deepen the government\u2019s ability to address more difficult, cross-\n                                                \n5  ADB. 2002.

The TA  will  support  the OJK  to  strengthen  its regulatory  structure  and \nintegrated supervision framework, deepen the financial market, and enhance access to financial \nservices. Priorities include strategic planning, ICT infrastructure, and the ongoing introduction of \nselect capital market instruments and initiatives related to microfinance and financial literacy. \n \n11.  Output  1:  Government\u2019s  policy  making  and  coordination  of  Financial  Sector \nStability Forum improved. The TA will (i) assist the BKF in coordinating implementation of the \nstandard operating procedures of FKSSK members; (ii) assist the center to coordinate financial \ninclusion activities between relevant ministries of the government, OJK, and Bank Indonesia; \nand (iii) produce a policy paper that will show the importance of tax neutrality for Islamic finance \nand selected capital market products, such as Global Master Repo Agreement. In addition to \nbuilding capacities, the TA will also procure equipment and ICT hardware for the center.   \n \n12.  Output 2: Financial Sector Agency\u2019s supervisory capacity and related information \nand communication technology framework developed. The TA will support (i) the OJK to \ndisseminate, implement, and monitor the consolidated financial sector master plan (para. 3); \nand (ii) key ICT projects, including an integrated e-licensing system, that will help the OJK in its \nrole  as  an  integrated  supervisor.  A  diagnosis  may  be  required  to  identify  prerequisites  of \nintegrated licensing.   \n \n13.  Output  3:  International  standards  in  conventional  and  Islamic  finance \nimplemented.  The  TA  will  support  the  OJK  in  adopting  and  implementing  international \nstandards, including those recommended by the Financial Stability Board country peer review, \nFinancial Sector Assessment Program, and Islamic Financial Services Board. The TA will also \nassist  the  OJK  to  implement  the  International  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions\u2019 \nmultilateral  memorandum  of  understanding  by  coordinating  with  and  building  capacities  of \nnonfinancial sector authorities. \n \n14.  Output 4: Financial inclusion regulatory framework strengthened with focus on \nmicrofinance, branchless banking, consumer protection, and financial literacy surveys. \nThe TA will assist the OJK in broadening financial inclusion and literacy initiatives, including \nthrough expanding branchless banking, setting up a microfinance center, and improving the \nmethodology of its financial literacy surveys.  \n \n15.  The TA assumes a favorable global financial market. Risks stem from a sudden change \nin OJK\u2019s management, insufficient technical capacity of the OJK and BKF to support reforms, \nfailure  to  enhance  coordination  of  financial  sector  reform,  and  resistance  to  implementing \ninternational standards from vested interest groups. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,575,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years, and is expected to commence in January \n2016 and end in January 2018. The Fiscal Policy Agency in the Ministry of Finance (MOF) is the \nexecuting agency while OJK is the implementing agency. Approval through no objection of TA \n ", "5 \n \nactivities including consultant engagement will be based on each agency\u2019s internal process. \n \n18.  The TA will engage 188 person-months of consulting services (29 person-months of \ninternational and 159 person-months of national services) through a mix of individuals and firms. \nThree types of consultants will be selected by ADB: (i) a team comprising six international and \nthree national financial sector development advisors that will be selected using quality- and \ncost-based selection at a ratio of 80:20, and a full technical proposal; (ii) one specialized firm for \nthe ICT system, which will use consultants\u2019 qualification selection; and (iii)  one short-term \nindividual advisor in financial inclusion policy.  \n \n19.  The  consultants\u2019  activity  will  be  conducted  under  two  teams:  financial  sector \ndevelopment  advisory  team  and  ICT  consultant  team.  The  financial  sector  development \nadvisory team will be led by a team leader who will work with teams from the BKF and the OJK \nin monitoring the progress of the FMDIP. The key activities will include (i) strengthening the \ncapacity of government (through the BKF\u2019s role as the secretariat of the FKSSK) to enable \nbetter  coordination;  (ii)  improving  Indonesia\u2019s  financial  inclusion  regulatory  framework;  (iii) \nstrengthening BKF\u2019s capacity to lead and coordinate the national financial inclusion agenda; \nand (iv) implementing international standards in conventional and Islamic finance in OJK. The \nICT consultant team will work with the OJK to develop an integrated supervisory and ICT \nframework. The TA will also finance a capacity-building program and procurement of ICT \nhardware for the center. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).7 Any procurement \nwill be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time \nto  time).  Disbursement  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nE.  Governance  \n \n19.  The MOF\u2019s financial management and procurement capacity to carry out the project is \nadequate. In June 2014, the MOF implemented an integrated financial management system that \naims to make the budgeting and budget execution process more efficient, economical, effective, \ntransparent,  and  accountable. 8  ADB  has  also  provided  support  to  the  National  Public \nProcurement Agency to improve regulatory framework and introduce e-procurement. As a result \nof  the  government\u2019s  continuing  commitment  to  reducing  corruption,  the  capacity  of  the \nCorruption Eradication Commission has improved markedly.9 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Indonesia for Enhancing the Regulatory Framework of Financial Sector \nDevelopment and Oversight, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n7  To improve the effectiveness of ADB\u2019s limited staff resources and to streamline TA administration, the user unit will \nexplore the use of lump-sum, fixed-cost, out-of-pocket expense contracts. \n8  The prevailing regulation on the integrated financial management system is the Ministry of Finance Regulation No. \n154/PMK.05/2014. \n9 From  2003  to  2012,  the  Corruption  Eradication  Commission  handled  223  high-profile  cases  involving  top \ngovernment officials; of these, 169 cases have been processed in court. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact of the TA is aligned with the National M  edium Term Development Plan, 2015\u20132019a for \nimproved resiliency and stability of Indonesia\u2019s financial system, and expanded access to financial \nservices for all. \n \nProject Results  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nChain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting   Risks \nOutcome  By 2018     \nA regulatory system  a.
