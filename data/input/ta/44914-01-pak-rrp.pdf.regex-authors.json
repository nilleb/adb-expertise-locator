THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Star Hydro Power Limited (SHPL) for the Patrind Hydropower Project. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1 and the summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Appendix 2. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Project Identification and Selection \n2.  As in most developing countries, energy deficits have been one of the major constraints \nand bottlenecks for efficient economic growth in Pakistan. To ensure a sustainable supply of \nenergy,  the  Government  of  Pakistan  launched  an  initiative  for  promotion  of  private  sector \nparticipation in the country\u2019s infrastructure, including the power sector. As a part of these efforts, \nthe  Power  Policy  1994  and  the  Hydel  Policy  1995  were  introduced,  both  of  which  were \nconsolidated in the Power Policy 2002. \n \n3.  The project is one of the long-gestated independent power producer (IPP) projects \nwhose site has been investigated extensively in the past. It was envisaged as one of the first \nseven prospective IPPs advertised by the Private Power Infrastructure Board (PPIB) in April \n2005 for private sector investment. \n \n4.  In October 2005, based on the technical and financial criteria, the PPIB issued a letter of \ninterest to the Emirates Trading Agency and TransAsia Gas International, both subsidiaries of \nthe Al-Ghurair Group from the United Arab Emirates, requesting them to undertake a feasibility \nstudy of the project. Subsequently, SHPL was incorporated by the Emirates Trading Agency \nand TransAsia Gas International in April 2006, and the PPIB approved the project\u2019s feasibility \nstudy in July 2007. \n \n5.  Given the experience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in advising and financing \nPakistan\u2019s first hydro IPP, the New Bong Escape Hydropower Project,1 the relatively large size \nof the project\u2019s debt financing requirement, and the fact that the private banking market has \nbeen hesitant in providing limited recourse financing to projects in Pakistan, SHPL approached \nADB in early 2008 for financing of the project. \n \n6.  In 2009, the consortium of the Korea Water Resources Corporation (K-water), Daewoo \nEngineering  and  Construction  Company  Limited  (Daewoo  E&C),  and  Sambu  Construction \nCompany Limited (Sambu) acquired SHPL fully through their special purpose vehicle, the KDS \nHydro Private Limited (KDS). On 27 August 2009, the PPIB issued a no-objection letter to the \nproposed change of SHPL\u2019s ownership. \n \nB.  Sector Background \n1.  Demand and Supply Gap of Electricity \n7.  Addition  of  power  generation  capacity  in  Pakistan  is  a  matter  of  utmost  urgency. \nPakistan\u2019s power industry faces a major supply deficit that is constraining the country\u2019s already \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to Laraib \nEnergy Limited for the New Bong Escape Hydropower Project in Pakistan. Manila. \n ", "2  \nfragile economic growth. As compared with 18,926 megawatts (MW) peak demand in mid-2010, \nthe country had only 14,723 MW firm supply, resulting in a shortfall of 4,203 MW (or 22.2% of \nthe  country\u2019s  peak  electricity  demand).2 As  of  June  2010,  the  country\u2019s  installed  power \ngeneration  capacity  was  20,375  MW,  of  which  about  55%  was  owned  and  operated  by \ngovernment entities and 45% by IPPs and/or majority private operators. Appendix 3 provides \nmore details on Pakistan\u2019s power sector. \n \n8.  Although electricity sales and demand have risen by more than 40% from FY2004 to \nFY2009, investment in new generation capacity has lagged behind expectation. The resultant \npower shortage has led to ever-increasing incidents of brownouts and blackouts in all major \nurban centers. Measures to ration consumption are already being taken. The blackouts in rural \nareas are worse where some areas suffered 22 hours without electricity last summer. Even with \nthe economic slowdown and dislocations caused by the flooding in 2010, power demand is \nexpected to continue to increase, and latent demand is considered substantial. Left unattended, \nthe country\u2019s power deficit will continue to worsen and will impact Pakistan\u2019s economy even \nmore adversely.  \n \n2.  Primary Energy and Fuel Mix  \n9.  Pakistan urgently needs to develop indigenous energy resources. The power industry in \nPakistan is a mix of thermal, hydro, and nuclear power plants. Thermal power plants, which use \nimported fuel oil to meet almost 52% of their fuel needs (the balance is based on gas), account \nfor 67.6% of installed capacity; hydro plants account for 30.3%, and nuclear plants provide the \nremaining 2%. Coal-fired thermal plants account for only 0.1%. Originally, the ratio of hydro to \nthermal installed generation capacity in the country was about 2:1 (in 1985). Over time, more \nthermal generation capacity was installed, leaving the country heavily dependent on imported oil \nfor its primary fuel requirements. Rising oil imports have caused the country\u2019s current account \ndeficit to increase. They have also caused considerable price escalation and volatility. High \nelectricity tariffs are eroding the viability and affordability of the sector. \n  \n3.  Financial Position \n10.  The \u201ccircular debt problem\u201d impedes the progress of power generation expansion and \nsours the mood of existing and potential investors in Pakistan\u2019s power industry. Circular debt is \ncaused by nonpayment of subsidies by the Government of Pakistan to cover a shortfall that \nresults from their notifying tariff charged to customers below the cost levels determined by the \nregulator. Distribution companies are not able to charge the full cost-recovery tariff determined \nby the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). The government has insulated \npower consumers by providing subsidies to distribution companies, but there have been delays \nin government payments. This has resulted in revenue shortfalls for distribution companies and \ntemporary deferment of payments to nearly all power plants in the system. Power generation \ncompanies have seen their receivables rise, and generation companies have been forced to \nstop, delay, or reduce payments to their fuel suppliers to balance their cash flows. This has \ncaused delays in fuel supply to power generators and negatively impacted generation capacity. \nThis issue is not new and has been partially mitigated in the past. However, it is once again \nbecoming a growing problem that must be resolved if the potential of the private sector to \naddress Pakistan\u2019s power deficit is to be unleashed. Measures are under way, but challenges \nremain. \n \n                                                 \n2  Private Power and Infrastructure Board. http://www.ppib.gov.pk/SupplyDemand.html \n ", "  3 \n4.  Response by the Government of Pakistan \n11.  To address the energy shortage and growing power crisis, the government has decided \nto implement several energy expansion initiatives, with an emphasis on developing indigenous \nresources. These initiatives include expanding thermal and hydropower generation capacity by \nIPPs under the government\u2019s Power Policy 2002, procuring power from rental power plants \nunder short-term agreements, securing electricity and gas imports from regional projects, and \ntapping into the huge potential of renewable energy sources. The government is also exploring \nthe possibility of using its domestic coal reserves, which are among the largest in the world \n(albeit low quality and remotely located). However, the time horizon for domestic coal-fired \npower generation is relatively long term. In the short to medium term, both conventional (i.e., \nthermal)  and  renewable  energy\u2014predominantly  hydro  and  wind\u2014are  expected  to  be  the \nmainstays  of  Pakistan\u2019s  electricity  supply.  Simultaneously,  improving  transmission  and \ndistribution efficiency is a key area of focus, and ADB has been assisting the government\u2019s \nprogram through its public sector operations.3 \n \n12.  The government has started efforts to resolve the circular debt problem by increasing \nconsumer tariffs and by transferring the debt in the system to a newly established company \noutside of the energy sector. ADB continues to support the government\u2019s sector reform program \nunder the Accelerating Economic Transformation Program.4 \n \n13.  The reform and restructuring of the sector has been supported by major development \npartners such as ADB and the World Bank, but progress has been slow and protracted and \nmany areas have lagged behind expectations.5 The appointment of independent boards of \ndirectors is critical for autonomy and commercial discipline, and recently the new boards of eight \ndistribution companies were appointed. An important measure required to move toward full \ncommercialization of the power industry is to make the Central Power Purchasing Authority \neffective  as  an  autonomous  body  to  ensure  financial  transparency  and  accountability. \nInsufficient reform of end-consumer tariffs, delinquent customer accounts, and other institutional \nfactors are major hurdles to reforming and improving the poor financial health of the sector. \n \n5.  Private Sector Investment in Pakistan \n14.  Pakistan has undertaken wide-ranging reforms in the energy sector with the assistance \nof ADB and the World Bank. In the early 1990s, the government, recognizing that the required \ninvestment in the sector could not be provided by the public sector alone, restructured and \nopened Pakistan\u2019s energy sector to private investment. Since then, Pakistan has had a long \nhistory of private sector involvement in the energy sector, and IPPs provide about a third of \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2006.

Under the Power Policy 2002, 11 IPPs representing almost 2,200 MW of installed \ncapacity have been commissioned or under construction. \n \n15.  ADB has taken the lead in supporting the government\u2019s initiative to attract private capital \ninto  the  energy  sector  and  has  been  instrumental  in  many  pioneering  transactions.  ADB \nfinanced  the  first  private  hydropower  project,  the  New  Bong  Escape  Hydropower  Project \n(footnote 1). This transaction set the precedent for many follow-on private hydropower projects \nin Pakistan including this project. ADB has also provided equity and a partial credit guarantee \nfor a gas-fired combined cycle power project, the Daharki Power Project, using indigenous gas.6 \nTo encourage investment in the energy sector, the government has taken steps to privatize \nstate-owned power companies\u2014both generation plants and distribution networks. ADB helped \nthe government privatize the Karachi Electric Supply Company, and provided a loan in 2007 for \nthe privatized entity to expand its generation, transmission, and distribution infrastructure.7 In \n2010, ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved a loan to support the Zorlu Enerji Power Project, \nwhich is the first wind power project to be undertaken by the private sector;8 and a loan and \npolitical risk guarantee to support the Uch-II Power Project,9 which uses a gas-fired combined \ncycle technology and indigenous gas.  \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n16.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which emphasizes investment in \ninfrastructure to achieve high sustainable economic progress, connect the poor to markets, and \nincrease  their  access  to  basic  productive  assets,  as  part  of  ADB\u2019s  support  for  achieving \ninclusive growth.10 Strategy 2020 puts particular emphasis on expanding energy supplies and \npromoting energy efficiency through supply-side measures. Strategy 2020 also emphasizes, \namong five drivers of change: (i) private sector development and private sector operations, and \n(ii) partnerships. The proposed assistance will promote a larger role for the private sector in \ndeveloping  infrastructure  through  partnerships  with  multilateral  development  banks  and  a \nbilateral financing agency. \n \n2.  Consistency with the Country Strategy \n17.  ADB\u2019s support for the project is in line with the country partnership strategy for Pakistan, \n2009\u20132013, which emphasizes the importance of energy sector development, private sector \nparticipation in infrastructure development, and expansion of ADB\u2019s private sector operations in \nthe energy sector.11 The project is a logical continuation of ADB\u2019s development and reform \nefforts in Pakistan\u2019s energy sector, which have been designed to promote a well-regulated, \nmarket-oriented power industry. Energy infrastructure has featured prominently in ADB\u2019s private \nsector operations in Pakistan. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2007.

The project is in line with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, and is particularly consistent with one of \nthe three pillars of that policy\u2014maximizing access to energy for all.12 Access to modern and \nreliable energy services fosters sustainable human development, economic growth, a higher \nquality of life, and improved delivery of social services. The project will add generation capacity \nand increase the reliability of electricity supplies in a country facing a severe power shortage. It \nwill promote the use of indigenous water resources. Electricity supplied by the project will be \nmore  affordable  than  existing  supplies,  and  will  not  be  affected  by  the  volatility  of  the \ninternational fuel market. By promoting the use of indigenous resources, the project will also \ncontribute to the country\u2019s energy security. The project will be more environmentally friendly \nthan conventional power plants that use fossil fuels, and will help ADB to meet its commitment \nto undertake clean energy investments of $1 billion per year. It is also expected that the project \nwill benefit from ADB\u2019s carbon market initiative for delivery of certified emission reductions. \n \nIII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Description \n1.

The project involves construction and operation of a 147 MW run-of-river hydroelectric \npower generation facility between the Kunhar and Jhelum Rivers near Muzaffarabad, on a build-\nown-operate-transfer basis. The concession period is 30 years from the commercial operations \ndate. The physical layout of the project extends from the location of the weir near Patrind village \non the Kunhar River, through a 2.2 kilometers (km) headrace tunnel to the location of the power \nhouse  on  the  Jhelum  River  at  Lower  Chattar  in  Muzaffarabad.  The  total  catchment  area \nmeasured at the weir site is 2,429 square kilometers. \n \n23.  The key components of the project include the weir, head pond, power intake, sand trap \nbasin, headrace tunnel, and power house. The weir on the Kunhar River will divert flows from \nthe Kunhar River to the Jhelum River through a system of power intake, sand trap, power shaft, \nand headrace tunnel. The project envisages the use of about net head of 108.1 meters between \nthe water intake on the Kunhar River and the power house, accommodating three vertical \nFrancis units, each of 50 MW capacity, to be built on the Jhelum River. The annual energy \ngeneration of the power plant, based on average historical hydrology, will be 632.6 gigawatt-\nhours, and the electricity will be fed into the network through a 132 kilovolt (kV) double-circuit \ntransmission line, to be constructed by the power purchaser. \n \n3.  Project Outputs and Outcome \n24.  The  outcome  of  the  project  will  be  generation  of  additional  electricity  supply  of \n632.6 gigawatt-hours  per  year  at  lower  cost.  The  project  will  generate  electricity  by  using \nindigenous water resources, and the tariff for electricity supplied by the project will be lower than \nthat for plants that use imported fuel. The project will also save greenhouse gas emission of \n280,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. \n \n25.  The outputs of the project are net additional installed capacity of 147 MW, which is \nequivalent to 3.5% of the current energy shortfall in the country. In addition, during construction, \nit is expected that locally purchased goods and services will amount to $241 million, and \n2,700 local jobs will be generated. \n \n ", "  7 \nB.  Development Impact \n1.  Contribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction through Private \nSector Development \n26.  The project will help alleviate Pakistan\u2019s severe power shortage, which is adversely \nimpacting  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  efforts.  The  project  will \nincrementally  increase  access  to  energy  for  households,  business,  and  industry.  Use  of \nindigenous natural resources will result in more affordable electricity and tariffs that are less \nsusceptible to fluctuations in the international fuel market. Use of indigenous water resources \nwill also relieve pressure on the country\u2019s balance of payments, assist in energy security, and \nadd to diversification of the energy mix. The project will demonstrate the advantages of private \nsector  participation  in  power  generation,  and  may  increase  general  investor  and  lender \nconfidence in Pakistan. In the long run, the project will contribute to the reduction of power \nshortages and the development of indigenous power sources. \n \n2.  Economic Sustainability \n27.  Economic benefits emanate from the willingness to pay for power revealed by the tariffs \nto be paid. Economic costs include the costs of preparatory work, capital expenditures, and \noperating costs. The base case economic internal rate of return of 14.2% exceeds the social \ndiscount rate of 10%.13 The economic analysis is in Appendix 3. \n \nC.  Environment and Social Dimensions  \n1.  Environment \n28.  The project is classified environmental category A, requiring an environmental impact \nassessment (EIA) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project\u2019s \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts  were  assessed  in  the  EIA  report  (2010)  conforming  to \nPakistan\u2019s  environmental  rules  and  regulations.  An  addendum  to  the  EIA,  a  detailed \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), a fish study, and a vegetation study\u2014providing more \nenvironmental assessment and planning information as well as mitigation measures\u2014were \nprepared to meet ADB safeguard requirements. The EIA report was disclosed on ADB\u2019s website \non 16 July 2010 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement; the supporting studies \nand  plans  will  also  be  posted  on  the  website.  The  potential  and  adverse  impacts  will  be \nminimized and mitigated as described in the EIA report, EMP, and supporting studies, with \nStar Hydro deemed to have sufficient capacity to manage environmental and social issues. \n \n29.  The most significant potential construction impact will arise from the generation and \ndisposal of 1 million m3 of spoil from tunneling and site preparation of the weir, power house, \nand switching yard. Spoil will be safely disposed of on low value and approved riverside land \ndisposal  sites.  Other  construction  impacts  include  noise  and  dust  generation,  erosion  and \nsedimentation, and those from the influx of construction workers and workers\u2019 health and safety. \nThese impacts are considered manageable and will be addressed by the appropriate mitigation \nmeasures proposed in the EMP.  \n \n                                                 \n13 The Evaluation Cooperation Group\u2019s Good Practice Standards for Private Sector Investment Operations rates a \nproject satisfactory if the economic internal rate of return is 10% or higher. \n ", "8  \n30.  Potential  adverse  project  operation  impacts  include  a  substantial  reduction  in \nKunhar River flows from the weir downstream to the Jhelum River confluence (13.4 km) for \n7.7 months of the year as a result of flow diversion to the power house. A 2 m3 per second flow \nwill be released from the weir to maintain a living aquatic ecosystem, equivalent to 1.3%\u20136.0% \nof average monthly stream flows. This flow will increase downstream as side stream flows enter \nthe Kunhar River, but the overall flow reduction will degrade the aquatic habitat, and the weir will \nprevent the upstream migration of fish. However, the fish species\u2019 diversity and number in this \nsection of the river are naturally low, partly because of the large temperature difference between \nthe  Kunhar  and  Jhelum  Rivers.  Given  the  relatively  low  fish  habitat  value  of  the  affected \ndownstream section of the Kunhar River, the proposed flow regime is expected to be adequate \nto address the potential impacts and not to compromise any habitat with significant aquatic \necological values. This section of the Kunhar is not used for domestic water supply or irrigation \nwater; the only use is occasional noncommercial fishing. Because of this low usage and the \navailability of a far greater fishing resource in the nearby Jhelum River, the loss of fishing will \nhave a relatively low impact. \n \n2.  Social Safeguards \n31.  The project has been classified category A with respect to involuntary resettlement and \ncategory C with respect to the impact on indigenous peoples. The project will physically displace \n28 households (comprised of 242 persons) and affect about 150 landowners as a result of \npermanent (about 40 hectares [ha]) and temporary (about 5 ha) acquisition of land for the \nreservoir impounding, weir structure, power house , surge chamber, access road, colony for \nconstruction staff, labor camp, and batching plant. The affected households/persons have been \ninformed of and consulted regarding the project activities and impacts. Arrangements for the \nvaluation of affected assets are participatory and include the formation of a land valuation \ncommittee made up of representatives of local government bodies, SHPL, and the affected \nhouseholds. A grievance redress committee was also set up with representation from district \nand local government bodies and the affected households. With respect to indigenous peoples, \nthe project is not expected to affect such groups as the community is comprised of local people \nbelonging to settled districts. Additional parcels of land are being considered for purchase as \nlandowners  interested  in  selling  their  land  have  approached  SHPL.  Appropriate  mitigation \nmeasures are described in the draft resettlement plan, which will be revised based on the \ncensus of affected persons and 100% inventory of affected assets after the project final footprint \nis determined. \n \n3.  Social Dimensions \n32.  Public  consultation  commenced  in  2006  during  the  preliminary  stage  of  project \npreparation. Concerns and issues raised included land acquisition, traffic hazards, employment, \nother project benefits, and cooperation with the community. The most recent consultation was \nconducted during the first quarter of 2011 to inform affected people about the updated project \ndesign and to listen to any comments and concerns, including a public hearing convened by the \nlocal government. A stakeholder engagement plan was also prepared, which provides details on \npublic consultations and subsequent public hearings as well as arrangements to ensure the \ninvolvement of women. Apart from the land acquisition concerns, which will be addressed during \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plan,  other  concerns  will  be  addressed  by  instituting \nmitigating measures such as the installation of a traffic alarm system and signs before any \nconstruction starts. Qualified locals (both men and women) will be given equal job opportunities \nduring  project  construction  and  operation,  and  SHPL  will  provide  assistance  in  improving \n ", "  9 \nschools, health clinics, local drinking water structures, and other communal facilities such as \nparks and playgrounds. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Construction Arrangements \n33.  During construction, the project\u2019s technical team will be headed by a project manager \nwho will coordinate with the EPC contractor, as well as with the owner\u2019s engineer and K-water\u2019s \nproject management supervision team. The project manager will be experienced in power plant \nmanagement  and  will  be  responsible  for  meeting  the  plant\u2019s  pre-operation  requirements.          \nK-water\u2019s supervision will complement the role of owner\u2019s engineer, and will strengthen the \noverall project management capacity of SHPL. \n \n34.  The project will be constructed under a date-certain lump-sum fixed-price EPC contract. \nThe EPC works will be performed by Daewoo Engineering & Construction Company Limited \nand Sambu Construction Company Limited. \n \n2.  Operations Arrangements \n35.  K-water, the main sponsor of the project, will also carry out O&M of the project under an \nO&M agreement. SHPL will benefit from K-water\u2019s industry experience and best practices, and \nwill be guided by K-water\u2019s policies, procedures, and standards\u2014particularly in the areas of \ncarrying out major maintenance and overhauls, O&M planning and budgeting, and capacity \nbuilding\u2014and will be subject to periodic audits to monitor compliance in these areas. \n \n3.  Water Use \n36.  SHPL will enter into water use agreements (WUAs) with the local government bodies, \nwhich will allow SHPL to have an exclusive right to use water of Khunhar River for the purpose \nof power generation during the term of the power purchase agreement (PPA).  \n \n4.  Power Offtake \n37.  The National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) is the power offtaker and \nwill purchase electricity from the project under a 30-year take-or-pay PPA. The tariff payable by \nNTDC will be consistent with the tariff determined by NEPRA, and will have two components: a \ncapacity charge and an energy charge. The capacity charge is based on the plant\u2019s available \ncapacity and covers the fixed portion of the O&M costs, debt service, and a fixed return on the \nequity investment. NTDC will pay the capacity charge monthly to SHPL\u2014regardless of whether \nelectricity from the project is actually dispatched. The energy charge is based on the actual \nvolume of electricity dispatch. It covers water use charges and variable components of the O&M \ncosts. NTDC will pay the energy charge monthly to SHPL. Both the capacity and energy \ncomponents of the tariff may be adjusted to account for inflation and fluctuations in foreign \nexchange and interest rates. Under the PPA, NTDC will also complete, operate, and maintain \nthe interconnection facilities and the transmission lines. \n \n5.  Role of the Government of Pakistan \n38.  The government plays a crucial role in the project as well as for other IPPs in Pakistan. \nIts  obligations  are  set  out  under  an  implementation  agreement  with  SHPL.  Under  the \n ", "10  \nimplementation agreement, the government grants the company the exclusive right to develop, \nown,  and  operate  the  project,  subject  to  applicable  laws,  regulations,  and  certain  other \nobligations, for a period of 30 years. Among the principal functions of the implementation \nagreement is to provide a guarantee to the company, sponsors, and lenders that the various \ngovernment  entities  and  agencies  will  meet  their  contractual  obligations\u2014including  paying \namounts due on time.  \n \n6.  Procurement \n39.  The project developer was selected through international competitive bidding, and the \nPPIB  issued  a  letter  of  interest  to  the  Emirates  Trading  Agency  and  TransAsia  Gas \nInternational, both subsidiaries of the Al-Ghurair Group from the United Arab Emirates based on \nthe technical and financial criteria. In August 2009, the PPIB approved a change of SHPL \nownership  to  the  consortium  of  K-water,  Daewoo  E&C,  and  Sambu  after  conducting  due \ndiligence of the consortium on the same criteria as in the original developer bid. The EPC \ncontract was tendered competitively. \n \n7.  Anticorruption Policy \n40.  SHPL was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and its \nPolicy on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). Consistent with \nits commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require SHPL to \ninstitute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best \npractice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the \nfinancing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The \nloan documentation between ADB and SHPL will further allow ADB to investigate any violation \nor potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation \n41.  SHPL  will  be  required  to  submit  quarterly  unaudited  financial  statements,  quarterly \nconstruction or operations reports, and annual operating budgets to ADB and the other lenders, \nand must report any material changes. The company will be required to hire an internationally \nreputable  accounting  firm  (or  its  local  affiliate)  to  audit  its  annual  accounts  in  line  with \ninternational financial reporting standards. ADB will monitor the project\u2019s construction progress \nand operational performance, using information from public sources, lender\u2019s advisors, and \ngovernment statistics. The project will be evaluated on two levels: (i) the success of the project, \nincluding its completion, commissioning, and operation; and (ii) impacts beyond the project, \nincluding the country\u2019s economic growth and the increase of private sector participation in \nPakistan\u2019s  energy  sector.  The  performance  indicators  are  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1). \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n1.  ADB Loan \n42.  ADB will provide a loan of up to $97 million will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources without government guarantee. The loan amount will not exceed 25% of the final total \nproject cost approved by NEPRA upon completion. Proceeds of the loan will be used for eligible \nproject costs. \n ", "  11 \n \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n43.  The proposed assistance by ADB to the project is justified for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  The project will add base load power generation capacity, which will help reduce \nload  shedding  in  Pakistan  and  strengthen  the  supply  network  and  stabilize \nvoltage of the local grid system. \n(ii)  The project will use indigenous water resources to supply affordable electricity \nand reduce reliance on expensive oil imports. This will significantly reduce the \nvolatility of the project\u2019s electricity tariff compared with other types of fuel-based \npower  projects  and  relieve  stress  on  Pakistan\u2019s  foreign  exchange  reserves. \nFurthermore, it will contribute to Pakistan\u2019s energy security. \n(iii)  The  project  will  save  greenhouse  gas  emissions  through  generating  clean \nelectricity to the grid and is likely to satisfy the eligible requirements for availing of \nthe Clean Development Mechanism established under the Kyoto Protocol of the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Expected revenues \nfrom the sale of certified emission reductions credits, which is based on about \n280,000 tons of carbon dioxide emission reductions per year, is anticipated to \nimprove the project\u2019s cash flows. The project would also benefit from assistance \nfrom ADB\u2019s Carbon Market Initiative. \n(iv)  The project will create job opportunities for local people during construction and \noperation  of  the  project,  and  will  support  socioeconomic  advancement  in  a \nremote and economically deprived area. \n(v)  ADB\u2019s active participation and presence in the project will reassure the sponsors \nand other lenders that the government and government entities will continue to \nsupport  the  project.  Given  ADB\u2019s  track  record  and  ongoing  engagement  in \nPakistan\u2019s  energy  sector\u2014including  policy  dialogue,  public  sector  reform \nprograms, and recent financing of key IPPs through private sector operations\u2014\nproject participants will value ADB\u2019s role in mitigating risk, solving problems, and \ncatalyzing  financial  resources  to  support  private  sector  power  projects  in \nPakistan. \n(vi)  ADB\u2019s assistance is considered indispensable to achieve financial close. The \nlong-term  financing  that  ADB  will  provide  is  essential  to  ensure  successful \nimplementation of the project, and would not otherwise be easily available from \ncommercial sources under the present financial and country environment. \n(vii)  The  proposed  assistance  to  the  project  is  aligned  with  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment plan and ADB\u2019s operational strategies as discussed in this report \n(paras. 16\u201318). \n \nC.  Assurances \n44.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(the Charter),14 no funding will be disbursed until ADB is satisfied that the principles enumerated \nunder Article 14 have been met. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and \nsubstance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of \nDirectors. \n \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 1966.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe project is consistent with Strategy 2020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)a which emphasizes investment in \ninfrastructure to achieve high sustainable economic progress, connect the poor to the markets, and increase their \naccess to basic productive assets, as part of ADB\u2019s support for achieving inclusive growth. Strategy 2020 puts \nparticular emphasis on expanding energy supplies and promoting energy efficiency through supply-side measures. \nStrategy 2020 also emphasizes private sector development and private sector participation. The project will fit with \nthese priorities as it will add new electric generation capacity to the country through private sector participation in \ndeveloping clean energy sources. The project remains fully consistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy,b under which support \nto renewable energy generation has been identified as a key priority. The project will indirectly contribute to poverty \nreduction by supporting economic development and providing critically needed power to support economic activities. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1. Key issues. The project will indirectly contribute to poverty reduction by supporting economic development of \nPakistan and by providing critically needed power to support economic activities.  Reliable power supply will contribute \ntoward improvement of transportation, communication, education, and health services as well as encourage the \nestablishment of livelihood enterprises and increase development opportunities for people of the area.  On a localized \nlevel, the project will entail involuntary resettlement impacts such as loss of residential housing and acquisition of land \n(farmland, wasteland, and riverbed land). The mitigation and compensation arrangements of these impacts will be \ndefined in the resettlement plan. \n \n2. Design features. The project is designed primarily to promote sustainable economic growth by increasing the \nsupply of energy to reduce a growing energy deficit, and enhance access to electricity for households, business, and \nindustry. The development impact of the project also includes environmental benefits through more efficient use of \nindigenous and renewable energy resources.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis   \n \nSocial safeguard planning. Involuntary resettlement is the main social impact related to the project. The aspect of \nacquisition of land in terms of land area requirement and infrastructure falling within the project area was also \ninvestigated.  This  involved  consultations  and  scoping  sessions  with  primary  and  secondary  stakeholders  like \nlandowners, local people, storekeepers, and religious community leaders. The cost of land, built-up property, economic \ntrees, and others were discussed with the owners, local people, and revenue department staff. The draft resettlement \nplan prepared for the project reveals that about 40 hectares (ha) of land (farmland and/or wasteland and riverbed land) \nwill be permanently acquired; about 5 ha will be temporarily acquired and used as area for the labor camp and use \nduring the construction phase of the project; 28 households (comprised of 242 persons) will be displaced; a single \ncommercial asset described as rudimentary water mill facility; and around 624 economic trees. The compensation for \nthese assets, including livelihood restoration programs, will be governed by the entitlement matrix in the resettlement \nplan. \n \nStakeholders  engagement.  A  stakeholders  engagement  plan  was  prepared  to  provide  details  on  how  public \nconsultations and subsequent public hearings, as well as arrangements to ensure involvement of women, will be \nengaged and documented. During community consultations, the community raised concerns such as land acquisition, \ntraffic hazards, employment, project benefits, and community engagement. The resolutions to these issues are mainly \ndocumented in the resettlement plan and other project agreement documents. \n \n \n \n ", "                                                                                                                            Appendix 2  15\nCore labor standards. The due diligence of Star Hydro Power Limited (SHPL) concludes that it will ensure fair, safe, \nand healthy working conditions in its operations and during construction through its contractors and subcontractors. It \nwill also ensure that applicable national labor laws and regulation, consistent with the core labor standards, will be \nfollowed in its human resources dealings and in engaging contractors and subcontractors. The prevailing labor and \nindustrial relations laws  guaranteeing freedom of association, collective bargaining, nondiscrimination, individual \nworker grievance resolution, and arbitration of labor disputes, will apply.  \n \nCorporate social responsibility. SHPL will engage responsive corporate social responsibility programs. Initially \nidentified are activities related to developing and improving the educational and health facilities near the project area. \nThe land that will be temporarily acquired will later be turned into playground and community parks. Other activities will \nbe implemented in consultation with the various community stakeholders. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation (C&P) process during project preparation.  \nCommunity consultations were carried out in the project area through formal and informal meetings, focus group \ndiscussions, and interviews. The consultants and SHPL staff initiated the sessions by giving a brief, simple, and \nnontechnical description of the project providing an overview of all likely positive and negative impacts. This was \nfollowed by an open discussion in which all participants were encouraged to voice their concerns and opinions. Apart \nfrom consultations with the local community, consultations with public representatives concerned and officials of the \nrelevant line government departments were also held.  \n \n2. What level of C&P is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n         Information sharing      Consultation        Collaborative decision making        Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared for project implementation?   Yes   No  \n \nSHPL prepared a stakeholders engagement plan detailing how public consultations and public hearing and other \nengagement with stakeholders will be engaged and documented.  \n \nC.  Gender and Development                 Gender Mainstreaming Category: Some gender benefits \n \n1. Key issues. Generally, the project will not cause any specific cultural or social impact on any distinct socioeconomic \ngroups, including women, although the involuntary resettlement impacts of the project may directly affect households \nand landholdings headed or owned by women. This type of impact will be adequately mitigated based on the \nentitlement matrix and will be monitored to ensure that affected or displaced people are as good or even better after the \nproject is constructed. On the corporate social responsibility front, programs will be designed and implemented by \nclosely coordinating with community stakeholders including women\u2019s groups, if applicable. A program designed and \nimplemented by the stakeholders is expected to solicit strong participation and generate positive results. On engaging \nlocal laborers, equal opportunity for qualified men and women will be observed.

Introduction \n \n1.  While electricity sales and demand increase by over 40% from FY2004 to FY2009, no \nadditional generation capacity has been added. The gap resulted in a major power supply \ndeficit. Many of Pakistan\u2019s rural areas do not have access to electric power and about half of the \npopulation is not connected to the grid. Among the electricity generated, conventional thermal \nplants using mainly oil and gas account for 64.2% of Pakistan\u2019s power generation capacity, with \nhydroelectricity contributing 33.4% and nuclear energy 2.4%. The initiatives undertaken by the \nGovernment of Pakistan include new or expanded generation capacities by thermal and hydro \nindependent power producers under the Power Policy 2002, securing electricity and gas imports \nfrom regional projects, as well as tapping the huge potential renewable energy sources.  \n \n2.  The  project  involves  the  construction  and  operation  of a 147  megawatt  run-of-river \nhydroelectric power generation facility between the Kunhar and Jhelum Rivers on a build-own-\noperate-transfer basis for a period of 30 years from the commercial operations date. \n \nB.  Valuation of Economic Benefits and Costs \n3.  The economic analysis for the project was conducted in accordance with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.1 The values in the \neconomic analysis reflect 2010 price levels. This economic analysis is carried out using the \nworld price numeraire. Domestic resources and nontraded items are adjusted with the standard \nconversion factor of 0.91.2 The economic internal rate of return is calculated from 2011, the \nstarting year of construction of the facility, to 2045, the end of the concession period. \n1.  Valuation of Economic Benefits \n4.  With Pakistan\u2019s energy supply deficit, the power produced by the plant is not expected to \nsubstitute  away  from  existing  generation  capacity,  thus  the  entire  output  of  the  plant  is \nconsidered incremental. The tariff paid is considered the willingness to pay for this incremental \npower. Annual savings of carbon dioxide emissions are valued at $10 per ton of carbon dioxide. \n2.  Valuation of Economic Costs \n5.  Capital and operating costs exclude interest during construction, fees and taxes, and \nfinancing costs. Shadow prices for foreign and domestic resources are applied accordingly. All \nlabor  is  considered  skilled,  since  less  than  2%  of  labor  costs  come  from  unskilled  labor \nrequirements. Environmental costs are included in the capital costs. Project preparatory costs \nare also included in the capital costs. About 70% of annual operating economic costs relate to \nthe maintenance of the infrastructure, and is therefore fixed. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997.
