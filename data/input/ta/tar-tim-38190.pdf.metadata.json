Implementation  of  the  National \nDevelopment Plan (NDP) and road map is being achieved, and the Government is enhancing \ndecision-making through the use of comprehensive sector analyses and the formulation of \nsector investment programs (SIPs), which identify investment opportunities for both Government \nand  development  partners.  Considerable  challenges  remain  in  this  area,  despite  the \nconsiderable achievements to date. \n \n2.  The  current  assistance  program  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  identifies \ncapacity development in economic management as a priority focus area. ADB has provided \nassistance in this sector since 2001. Key technical assistance (TA) grants1 have supported the \nGovernment in economic and financial management. The Government has appreciated, in \nparticular,  the  expertise  provided  by  the  petroleum  fiscal  adviser  to  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s \nDepartment on the issue of Timor Sea revenues. The Ministry of Planning and Finance (MPF) \nhas  received  valuable  assistance  for  the  development  of  SIPs  in  the  energy,  transport, \ncommunications, and water sectors; and in the overall management and coordination of the SIP \nexercise. Support to MPF to improve monitoring of NDP implementation includes the provision \nof better tools, and development of in-house skills and competency to assist line ministries in \nplanning and delivery of their programs. A common recommendation emerging from these TAs \nis that additional support is required to entrench the capacity already developed in these key \ngovernment units and to enable them to respond to the immediate and medium-term challenges \nfacing the Government. \n \n3.  This TA2 will improve the Government\u2019s capacity for economic and financial planning \nand  management  by  continuing  to  support  NDP  implementation  and  the  management  of \npetroleum revenues. \n \n4.  During the Country Programming Mission in March 2004, the Minister for Planning and \nFinance endorsed the TA. The Fact-Finding Mission fielded in September 2004 finalized TA \ndesign and discussed the rationale, objectives, scope, cost estimates, and implementation \narrangements  with  MPF.  In  December  2004,  the  Government  agreed  to  the  TA.  The  TA \nframework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  The  Government  is  striving  to  build  its  economy  and  develop  a  responsible  and \nresponsive government with an efficient, effective and accountable civil service from the point of \nview of donor harmonization and alignment. Many development partners including ADB, World \nBank, United Nations, and bilateral agencies of the governments of Australia, the European \nUnion, Portugal, and United States, among others, are actively involved in supporting public \nsector management. Challenges exist in several areas, notably budget planning and allocation, \nbudget execution, and expenditure control and accountability mechanisms. The withdrawal of \ninternational advisers has lent urgency to the development of a well-designed, sustainable \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n2 The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 27 October 2004. ", "2 \ncapacity-building program in financial management across government. The Government has \nasked  the  World  Bank  to  lead  development  partners  with  an  interest  in  public  financial \nmanagement  to  jointly  support  the  development  of  an  integrated  and  long-term  financial \nmanagement capacity-building Program. ADB supports the concept of a joint integrated initiative \nto ensure that the efforts of development partners are coherent from the point of view of donor \nharmonization and alignment. This initiative is still in the planning phase and ADB is monitoring \nthe progress. \n \n6.  A number of key issues can and should be addressed now. The Government\u2019s draft \npriorities  and  proposed  SIP  for  public  sector  management  identifies  the  critical  need  for \nstrengthened planning processes and a more comprehensive budget framework for revenue \ncapture and expenditure management. \n   \n7.  Strengthened planning and monitoring.  The National Directorate for Planning and \nExternal Assistance Coordination (NDPEAC) in MPF is the lead unit responsible for overall \nsupervision  of  the  Government's  planning  process,  including  oversight  of  the  agency-level \nannual action plans, the SIP exercise, and preparation of the next 5-year national development \nplan. It is continuing to develop and implement a comprehensive, government-wide information \nsystem to monitor NDP progress, and to provide a central repository of information on donor-\nfunded projects. Complementing its planning mandate, NDPEAC is also responsible for overall \ncoordination of external assistance to Timor-Leste. NDPEAC has a demanding work program \nover the next 4 years, and the Government has requested ongoing support for its work. \n \n8.  In the immediate short term, the Government needs to finalize the SIP process before \nthe next Timor-Leste and development partners meeting. For the process to be of value in the \nlong term, however, the Government needs to mainstream this process as an integral part of the \nannual  budget  process.  For  this  to  happen,  NDPEAC  must  be  able  to  take  the  lead  in \nsupporting all government agencies in their planning and monitoring of the programs for which \nthey are responsible through the annual action plan processes. NDPEAC also must be able to \noptimize the utility of the systems and documentation for planning and monitoring. \n \n9.  Fiscal management. Petroleum revenues will be important to Timor-Leste\u2019s economic \ndevelopment. International experience, however, indicates that natural resource riches can be a \ncause for concern. Timor-Leste has adopted prudent policies regarding the management of \npetroleum and has committed to transparent and accountable operations for the management \nand tax regime for the extraction of oil and gas, and the management of the financial savings via \na petroleum fund. The United States Agency for International Development and ADB have given \nthe Government considerable support. The Government has drafted a fiscal policy framework \nand a savings policy, and is considering a proposal for a petroleum fund. An extensive public \nconsultation process is under way. The Council of Ministers will propose the draft legislation for \nthe petroleum fund to the Parliament in early 2005. \n \n10.  Future developments in this area will need to include an assessment of the results of the \nconsultation process and the incorporation of that feedback into the Government\u2019s next steps. \nThe  implementation  of  the  legislative  and  policy  framework  is  critical.  Sound  revenue \nforecasting is vital to the Government\u2019s economic management and budget planning process \nand is of great interest to the development partner community. The Government will face \nseveral critical decisions in this area and will be relying on the best possible information to make \nsound decisions. The Government has indicated that continuing support is vital. \n ", "    3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n11.
