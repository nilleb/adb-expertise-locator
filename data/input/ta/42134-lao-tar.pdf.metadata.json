The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is assisting the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao  PDR)  in  (i)  promoting  pro-poor  sustainable  growth,  (ii)  fostering  inclusive  social \ndevelopment, and (iii) addressing priority governance issues.1 In supporting these priority areas, \nADB emphasizes that continuing investments in basic education need to be matched with a \ngradual shift toward strengthening vocational and higher education. The Government requested \nADB to support the development of the higher education system so as to meet the growing \ndemand for educated citizens and a skilled workforce for national development and to prepare \nthe  Lao  PDR  for  regional  and  international  economic  integration.  ADB\u2019s  2008  Country \nProgramming Mission confirmed the inclusion of project preparatory technical assistance (TA) \nfor the Strengthening Higher Education Project during 2008, with an ensuing grant programmed \nin 2009.2  The Fact-Finding Mission to the Lao PDR in June 2008 reached an understanding \nwith  the  Government  on  the  TA\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  scope,  implementation \narrangements, cost estimates, financing plan, and outline terms of reference for the consultants. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Over the past 7 years, the macroeconomic environment in the Lao PDR has stabilized, \nafter an uncertain period in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian economic crisis. The Lao PDR is \nnow witnessing a period of robust economic growth with gross domestic product (GDP) growing \nat 7.3% in 2006 and annual GDP growth rates projected to remain at 8.2% through 2010.  The \nLao  PDR,  being  strategically  located  in  the  economic  corridors  of  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion (GMS), plays a key role in strengthening connectivity and facilitating cross-border \nmovement and tourism in the GMS.3 The Government seeks to achieve economic growth with \nreduced poverty to meet the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, and graduate from its \nleast-developed  country  (LDC)  status  by  2020.  An  initial poverty  and  social  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n3.  To  achieve  the  Government\u2019s  goal  of  graduating  from  LDC  status  by  2020  and to \nprepare  for  the  country\u2019s  regional  and  international  integration,  the  Sixth  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment  Plan  2006\u20132010  (SEDP6)  provides  a  coherent  and  cohesive  development \nframework, identifying education as one of the four pillars of its poverty reduction strategy. \nSEDP6 recognizes that education is fundamental to socioeconomic development for it equips \ncitizens with the required skills and attitudes in a rapidly changing society.4 There is pressure for \nthe Lao PDR to provide higher education because it needs to utilize more intermediate and \nadvanced knowledge and technology in all sectors. Although fully cognizant of the need to \nstrengthen basic education, ADB shares the Government\u2019s concern with the need for balanced \neducation sector development and gradual expansion of access to higher education to meet the \ndemand  for  a  more  educated  and  skilled  workforce.  ADB  is  providing  advisory  technical \nassistance to help the Ministry of Education (MOE) develop a comprehensive plan known as the \neducation sector development framework (ESDF).5  However, the higher education system in \nthe Lao DPR still lacks a clear vision, policy and strategies, and road map to reach regional and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

The Government initiated higher education reforms governing both public and private \nhigher education institutions (HEIs) with the Prime Ministerial Decrees on the Establishment of \nthe National University of Laos (NUOL) in 1995, Private Higher Education in 1995, and Higher \nEducation Curriculum in 2001. The decree establishing NUOL began to address the issue of a \nfragmented higher education system by amalgamating 10 HEIs under the structure of NUOL. \nAfter the establishment of NUOL, two regional universities were established to broaden access \nto  higher  education\u2500Champasak  University  (CU)  in  Pakse  in  the  south  in  2002,  and \nSouphanouvong University (SU) in Luang Prabang in the north in 2003. Luang Prabang and \nPakse are becoming core provincial cities in the GMS corridor network. In 2007, the Prime \nMinister\u2019s  Decree  on  the  Adoption  and  Implementation  of  the  National  Education  System \nReform Strategy, 2006\u20132015, was issued. The decree required the strengthened HEIs to move \nthe higher education system toward regional and international standards and contribute to the \nsocioeconomic development of the country.   \n \n5.  Higher  education  reform  and  development  in  the  Lao  PDR  have  made  remarkable \nprogress to date. However, the higher education system needs to be further strengthened and \nupgraded  by  addressing,  among  others,  the  following  issues  and  constraints:  (i)  equitable \naccess, (ii) quality, (iii) relevance, and (iv) management.  \n \n6.  Equitable Access. There are 3 public universities (NUOL, SU, and CU), 5 teacher \ntraining colleges, and 78 private HEIs located in Vientiane and other provincial capital cities, and  \nenrolling about 5.3% of the tertiary education age cohort. In 2007, the total student enrollment at \nthe three public universities reached 35,403 (NUOL with 27,102; CU with 4,651; and SU with \n3,650). But the capacity to meet the increasing number of students is limited. In 2006, no more \nthan 18,096 students (about 42%) out of the 42,157 upper secondary school graduates could \ngain access to public universities. It is foreseen that a gap between enrollment demand and \nadmission capacity of public universities would widen, leading to the proliferation of private \ncolleges (mainly in the business-related areas such as business administration, computer and \ninformation science, and English language) in recent years. University admission systems, \nincluding  quota  and  nonquota  allocation  and  student  financial  assistance  schemes  and \nenrollment capacity, need to be renovated to ensure equitable access to higher education. In \naddition to low enrollment rate, disparities in access still persist, resulting in low representation \nof women and ethnic groups. In 2007, female students were 37% at NUOL, 31% at SU, and \n39% at CU. At NUOL, ethnic quota students (affirmative admission system adopted in the Lao \nPDR) comprised 35% and ethnic female quota students comprised 17%. \n \n7.  Quality. The quality of higher education is low partly because of the poor quality of \neducation at the secondary level, and partly because of dilapidated facilities and equipment, and \nunderqualified teaching staff. Especially in the newly opened CU and SU, huge investments are \nrequired in facilities (e.g., classrooms and libraries) and equipment (e.g., research and teaching \nlaboratories). While NUOL has a reasonably well-qualified teaching staff, 45% of whom have \npostgraduate degrees, few faculty members have postgraduate qualifications at CU and SU, \nwhich  are  staffed  by  new  graduates  whose  research  and  teaching  capacity  are  greatly \nconstrained. Students\u2019 academic performance as higher diploma and bachelor degree holders is \nlargely unknown compared with regional and international standards. It is also necessary to \nassess the impact on students\u2019 academic performance of the change to 1 year of foundation \nstudies followed by 4 years of professional studies at specific faculties. Quality assurance and \naccreditation systems and measures are about to emerge, but are not yet functioning.  \n \n ", "    3\n8.  Relevance. There are imbalances between the demand for and supply of university \ngraduates. A major bottleneck in the economy is still the scarcity of professional and technical \npersonnel (e.g., administrators, accountants, lawyers, and engineers) in both public and private \nsectors. Most HEIs, except for NUOL, are not able to meet those needs. Particularly for SU and \nCU, which produced fresh graduates with diploma and bachelor degree holders for the first time \nsince their establishment, tracer studies will be required to collect benchmark information on \ntheir graduates and monitor their performance in the labor market.      \n \n9.  Management.  The capacity of management in the higher education system in MOE and \nin each HEI is rather weak. There are tremendous capacity development needs in university \ngovernance and management (in terms of the level of autonomy and accountability), financing \nmechanisms, quality assurance and accreditation systems, and management of research and \ndevelopment and public\u2013private partnerships. Data and information in the higher education \nsubsector lack linkage with private colleges, and overall coordination, integration, and access to \nMOE\u2019s central education management information system need to be greatly improved.  \n \n10.  At the tertiary level, ADB supported the establishment and development of NUOL from \n1995 to 2003, when improving the quality of NUOL and developing two universities (SU and \nCU) were envisaged as the next phase in the development of higher education.6 ADB has also \nsupported higher education projects in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Mongolia, Papua New Guinea, \nSri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Major lessons from those projects are that (i) basic research \ntakes more time and resources than applied research does before outputs become visible; (ii) \nthe market for postgraduate degree holders, including the brain drain, is an issue; and (iii) key \nprivate enterprises need to be involved at the design phase to ensure that the skills taught are \nrelevant to market demand. There are also general concerns across sectors regarding the \ncapacity to manage and implement projects. Advance action for initial recruitment of consultants \nand procurement can help in the initial activities of projects. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact of the TA will be increased access to, improved quality and relevance of, and \nstrengthened capacity of administration and management in higher education. The outcome will \nbe an agreed-upon project design suitable for ADB financing that aims to strengthen the higher \neducation system, focusing on NUOL, SU, CU, and other key HEIs to help them reach regional \nand international standards in quality, relevance, attractiveness, and competitiveness.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The main outputs will be (i) an analysis of the higher education sector including the \nrelevance of postsecondary education to the labor market; (ii) a proposal for the coherent policy, \nstrategies, and regulatory framework for higher education; (iii) an outline of the master plan for \ndeveloping higher education for 2010\u20132020; (iv) a project outline that addresses key sector \nconstraints and issues, including arrangements for project management and implementation; \nand (v) a detailed design for the proposed project in line with the Government\u2019s policy and \nstrategies and ADB requirements.   \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 1995.

Manila.  \n ", "4   \n13.  The TA will conduct a sector analysis by examining constraints and issues in higher \neducation;  reviewing  systems/models  of  higher  education,  including  those  in  neighboring \ncountries; and assessing the relevance of postsecondary education to the labor market, utilizing \ntracer studies and household surveys. The TA will prepare a proposal for the coherent policy, \nstrategies, and regulatory framework for the higher education system. More specifically, the TA \nwill provide technical assistance support in determining (i) governance arrangements; (ii) level \nof  autonomy;  (iii)  accountability  requirements/mechanisms;  (iv)  financing  arrangements \n(including salary structures and incentive mechanisms); (v) quality assurance arrangements \n(including  recognition  of  higher  education  degrees);  (vi)  management  staff  and  faculty \nrecruitment arrangements; (vii) student recruitment arrangements (including equity concerns); \nand (viii) public\u2013private partnerships in research, teaching, and management. The TA will also \nprepare an outline of the master plan for developing higher education for 2010\u20132020. The plan  \nwill be developed and implemented under the ensuing project, in line with the ESDF to be \ndeveloped and the National Education System Reform Strategy.   \n \n14.  The TA will conduct a project feasibility study for the ensuing project, including facilities, \nfaculty/staff, and program development at NUOL, SU in Luang Prabang, CU in Pakse, and other \nHEIs on a priority basis. The TA will (i) assess MOE\u2019s capacity to regulate the higher education \nsystem; (ii) analyze the demand for university faculties and departments to be developed; (iii) \nmake a detailed economic analysis of the project (including viability and feasibility); (iv) make a \ndetailed financial analysis of the project; (v) make a detailed social analysis including preparing \nsafeguard plans or a framework as required; and (vi) prepare plans for architectural designs, \ncivil works, and procuring equipment and engaging consultants. The TA will examine and \ndetermine  arrangements  for  project  management  and  implementation  and,  in  view  of  the \nlessons learned, will include \u201cproject readiness\u201d or \u201cbridging\u201d assistance to facilitate start-up \nactivities (e.g., recruiting consultants, preparing bidding documents). \n \n15.   MOE recognizes that the development of a higher education system with regional and \ninternational standards in research and teaching can be critical in integrating the Lao PDR into \nthe regional and global economy, as well as in achieving the Government\u2019s goal of moving \ntoward  modernization  and  industrialization  and  graduating  from  LDC  status  by  2020.  The \nensuing project will likely have the following outputs: (i) a master plan for higher education \ndevelopment for 2010\u20132020, including a policy and regulatory framework that will implement \narrangements for governance, financing, and quality-assurance procedures; (ii) establishment \nand development of universities, which will build and equip mainly CU and potentially SU, and \ndevelop and deliver training programs for leaders, management, and teaching and research \nstaff;  and  (iii)  management  of  project  implementation,  to  coordinate  project  activities,  and \nmonitor performance and results.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $720,000, of which $600,000 equivalent \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of \nJapan. The remaining $120,000 equivalent will be contributed by the Government and will \ninclude office accommodation, utilities, remuneration and per diem for counterpart staff, local \ntransportation for support staff, and administration support. The Government has been informed \nthat  approval  of  the  TA  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  any  ensuing  project.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \n \n \n \n ", "    5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  Project Management. MOE will be the Executing Agency and will provide counterpart \nsupport. A project management unit (PMU) will be established in the Department of Higher \nEducation  of  MOE.  The  PMU  will  have  a  qualified  TA  project  manager  and  project  staff \nacceptable to ADB, with skills across the range of issues that will be covered during project \npreparation. The PMU will include representatives from each of the university subproject teams, \nand will liaise with the ADB team. MOE will allocate office space and the university subprojects \nconcerned will also allocate office space during the mission to the provinces concerned. Overall \nguidance for the TA project will be the responsibility of an existing project steering committee \n(PSC) to be chaired by the vice minister of MOE in charge of higher education. The PSC will \ncomprise representatives from MOE and concerned universities, as well as representatives from \nMinistry of Finance, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Planning and \nInvestment, and Prime Minister\u2019s Office.  \n \n18.  Consulting Services.  A team of 8 international consultants to serve for 19 person-\nmonths and 11 national consultants for 32 person-months will provide expertise in (i) strategic \nplanning and management; (ii) university governance, financing, and quality assurance; (iii) \nuniversity campus, facilities, and laboratory development; (iv) university human resource and \ncapacity development; (v) curriculum development and academic design; (vi) economic and \nfinancial analyses/management, and project costing; (vii) procurement; (viii) social development; \n(ix) resettlement; and (x) environmental assessment. ADB will select and engage consultants \nthrough a firm, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). The simplified technical proposal and quality- and cost-based \nselection method with standard quality-cost ratio of 80:20 will be used. The outline terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 4. All TA-financed goods will be procured in line with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Upon completion of the \nTA, all equipment procured under the project will be handed over to and retained by MOE. \n \n19.  Implementation Period and Reporting Requirements. The TA project will be carried \nout over 8 months, starting from November 2008.  An inception report and TA implementation \nplan will be submitted within month 1 of the start of the TA and will be discussed at an inception \nseminar. A midterm report, including a draft project outline, will be submitted within 3 months. In \nmonth 4, a midterm seminar will be organized to discuss the draft project outline with all \nconcerned stakeholders. A final seminar on the draft TA final report will be scheduled in month 6. \nThe appraisal workshop for the TA final report will be organized jointly by the Government and \nADB at the beginning of month 8. The TA final report will be submitted to the Government and \nADB by the end of month 8. The TA project completion date will be 30 June 2009. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for preparing the Strengthening \nHigher Education Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nAccess, quality,  Increase in the number of  EMIS of MOE and  \u2022  The economy of the Lao \nrelevance, and  undergraduate students in  universities   PDR will grow on a \nmanagement capacity in  public universities from    sustainable basis.   \nhigher education improved  30,000 in 2010 (actual  University annual reports   \nand strengthened  number to be determined    \u2022  The Government sustains \n  based on the demand  Budgetary expenditure data  its priority on the \nanalysis during the TA).  development of higher \n  education in the context of \nIncrease in teaching staff  balanced development in \nwith postgraduate degrees  the education sector. \nin public universities   \n(actual number will be  \u2022  University-industry linkages \nestablished through the  will continue to grow. \nTA).   \n  \u2022  Close coordination with the \nUniversity autonomy and  private sector will be \naccountability system will  maintained to ensure \nbe in place.  university training is \n  consistent with the needs of \nA quality assurance  industry. \nsystem will be established   \nand functioning.   \nOutcome      Assumption \nAn agreed-upon design  Project design is agreed  Memorandum of  \u2022  MOE supports the \nfor a grant project,  upon by the Government  understanding of the grant  development of coherent \nsuitable for ADB  of the Lao PDR and ADB  appraisal mission  policy, strategies, action \nfinancing  by 31 May 2009.    plan, and regulatory \n    TA final report approved by  framework for the higher \nADB  education sector. \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.

The Government seeks to achieve economic growth, reduce poverty, meet the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals by 2015, face modernization and industrialization, and graduate from its least-developed country (LDC) \nstatus by 2020. The Sixth Socioeconomic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010 (SEDP6), provides a coherent and cohesive \ndevelopment framework, identifying education as one of the four pillars of its poverty reduction strategy. SEDP6 recognizes \nthat education is fundamental to socioeconomic development because it equips citizens with the required skills and attitudes \nin a rapidly changing society.a To achieve the Government\u2019s goal of graduating from LDC status by 2020, the country needs to \nutilize more intermediate and advanced knowledge and technology in all sectors. Due to globalization, the Lao PDR needs to \nprepare for regional and international integration. Integration creates pressure to provide higher education that is of high \nquality and relevance.   \n \nIn line with SEDP6 strategies and priorities, the Lao PDR country strategy and program (CSP) (2007\u2013-2010) aims to assist the \nLao PDR in (i) promoting pro-poor, sustainable growth,; (ii) fostering inclusive social development, and (iii) addressing priority \ngovernance issues.b Through the pursuit of the strategic pillars of the regional cooperation strategy and program 2007\u20132009, \nthe Lao PDR, being strategically located in the economic corridors of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), plays a key role in \nstrengthening connectivity and facilitating cross-border movement and tourism in the GMS.c In the CSP, ADB emphasizes that \ncontinuing investments in basic education need to be matched with a gradual shift toward strengthening the lower secondary \nand upper secondary sector and that, as school education continues to expand, demand will grow for better vocational and \nhigher education. Although fully cognizant of the need to strengthen basic education, ADB shares the Government\u2019s concern \nfor the need for balanced development of the education sector and gradual expansion of access to higher education. ADB is \nproviding advisory technical assistance to help the Ministry of Education (MOE) develop a comprehensive plan for the \neducation sector (with its extension to be cofinanced by the Australian Agency for International Development [AusAID]), and it \nis  necessary  to  ensure  linkage  between  the  development  of  higher  education  and  the  education  sector  development \nframework. \nB.  Targeting Classification          \n1.   Select the targeting classification of the project: \n General Intervention (GI)   Individual or Household (TI-H)  Geographic (TI-G)  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n    2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nThe  TA  will  prepare  an  investment  project  to  upgrade  three  public  universities\u2500National  University  of  Laos  (NOUL), \nSouphanouvong University (SU) in Luang Prabang, and Champasak University (CU) in Pakse\u2500and other higher education \ninstitutions (HEIs) on a priority basis, in the areas of facility, staff, and program development. The project will also include the \nsupport for overall and coherent policy and regulatory framework for the higher education system, which will prepare and \nimplement arrangements for governance, financing, and quality assurance procedures. All these will enhance the country\u2019s \ncapacity to produce highly qualified graduates in key disciplines responding to the labor market demand. The proposed project \nis envisaged to reduce poverty indirectly by upgrading public universities to become centers of research and teaching \nexcellence in the country, with closer public-private partnerships. Such improvement, in turn, will contribute to pro-poor, \nsustainable economic growth as well as inclusive social development.   \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n       1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed? N/A  \n \n  2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence? \nA national social development specialist, under the guidance of the project team member in charge of social development and \ngender aspects, will be engaged to conduct poverty analysis.   \n ", "  Appendix 2  9\n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nThe proposed project aims to upgrade three public universities (NUOL, SU, and CU) as centers of research and teaching \nexcellence in the country, with closer public-private partnerships.  The upgrade should create the potential for pro-poor growth. \nIn addition, the design of the proposed project will consider such socially inclusive measures as affirmative admission criteria \n(quota system), level of tuition, and financial assistance schemes favoring students from poor households, especially females \nfrom ethnic minorities.    \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \n \nThe potential primary beneficiaries will be upper secondary school graduates and students of existing universities, who will \nhave access to three upgraded public universities that will meet regional standards of quality, relevance, attractiveness, and \ncompetitiveness. In 2007, the student enrollment at three public universities reached 35,403 (NUOL with 27,102, CU with \n4,651, and SU with 3,650). Disparities in access still persist, resulting in low representation of women and ethnic groups. In \n2007, female students comprised 37% at NUOL, 31% at SU, and 39% at CU.  At NUOL, ethnic quota students comprised 35% \nand ethnic female quota students, 17%.  Capacity to meet the increasing number of students is limited. In 2006, out of 42,157 \nupper secondary school graduates, no more than 18,096 (about 42%) could gain access to public universities. The proposed \nproject will prepare and implement policy measures to increase equitable access to higher education by, among others, \npromoting effective access to tuition fee and financial assistance. The poor and the socially excluded can have access to \nupgraded public universities through affirmative admission criteria (quota system), as well as student tuition and student \nfinancial assistance schemes. Thus, all qualified students will be admitted regardless of their ability to pay tuition and other \nrelated costs. Other primary beneficiaries are younger faculty members who will be sent overseas for postgraduate degree \nprograms.  \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nThe potential needs of beneficiaries include the level of autonomy in university governance, flexibility and equity in the financial \nmechanism, and transparency and accountability in the quality assurance system, which are the enabling conditions for their \nequitable access to high-quality graduate and postgraduate education programs.     \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? \n \nThe Government and university authorities may not be fully aware of the required level of autonomy in university governance, \nflexibility in the financial mechanism, and transparency and accountability in the quality assurance system that would enable \npublic  universities  to  reach  regional  standards  of  quality,  relevance,  attractiveness,  and  competitiveness.  The  project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will review systems and models of higher education and draw lessons for developing \noverall and coherent policy, strategies, and regulatory framework suitable for public universities, and the proposed project will \nhelp the Government and universities implement such policy, strategies, and regulatory framework.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n  1.   Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n \nUpper secondary and undergraduate education age cohorts will be the potential initial stakeholders. Education decision \nmakers, planners, managers, and university subproject teams comprising university administrators and faculty members will be \ninvolved in the project, both as executing and implementing agencies and as beneficiaries of the project activities. The private \nsector will also be involved through (i) representation on the university council, board or decision-making committee; (ii) \ninvolvement in program definition, curriculum design, and thesis panels; and (iii) hiring of teaching staff from enterprises.   \n \n  2.  What  type  of  consultation  and  participation  is  required  during  the  PPTA  or  project  processing  (e.g., \nworkshops, community mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \n \nDuring the PPTA, the following seminars and workshops will be conducted: (i) inception, midterm, and final seminars involving \nall the project stakeholders; (ii) a workshop on policy, strategies, and regulatory framework, involving decision makers, \nplanners, managers, and representatives from the private sector on the policy and regulatory framework; and (iii) focused \nproject planning workshops involving university subproject stakeholders in Luang Prabang and Pakse.    \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n ", "10   Appendix 2 \n4.  Will a consultation and participation plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nA separate consultation and participation plan is not required. ADB has already started stakeholder consultations with the \ncentral and provincial governments, university representatives, the private sector, and other development partners (particularly \nAustralia, Japan, and Republic of Korea). Furthermore, consultation and participation processes will be mainstreamed in \nrelevant project components and documents such as a resettlement framework or a short resettlement plan, and gender action \nplan.  \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector and/or subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project or program? \n \nKey gender issues are (i) an imbalance in educational attainment, at the upper secondary and tertiary levels, where fewer girls \nthan boys are enrolled, (the gap is very wide between the majority of \u201cLao Loum\u201d boys and ethnic minority girls); and (ii) an \nimbalance in teaching staff at the tertiary level, where female teachers are fewer than male teachers.         \n \n2.  Does the proposed project or program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision making? \n \n    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nThe proposed project aims to (i) introduce admission criteria that will encourage enrollment by female students in general, (ii) \ngive special consideration to student tuition and financial assistance schemes for qualified ethnic minority female students by \nreviewing the existing quota and nonquota admission systems, and (iii) put priority on hiring qualified female faculty members.    \n \n3.  Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality?       \n \n  Yes          No    Please explain. \n \nThe proposed project aims to establish a nondiscriminatory environment for female students and female faculty members.  \n \nIII.
