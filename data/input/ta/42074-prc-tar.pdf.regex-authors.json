INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During the December 2008 country programming mission of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), the Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) requested technical \nassistance (TA)1 to study recycling waste coal for power generation at the Pingshuo coal mine \nin Shanxi Province. ADB conducted a fact-finding mission from 4\u20135 June 2009 and reached an \nunderstanding  with  the  Shanxi  provincial  government  on  the  TA\u2019s  objective,  scope,  cost \nestimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and consultants' terms of reference. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  In 2008, coal-fired power stations generated 81% of total 2,779.3 terawatt-hour (TWh) \nelectricity in PRC.2 The power sector consumed 1.3 billion tons of raw coal, or about 50% of \ntotal coal produced in PRC.3 Every year, waste coal is generated during coal production as the \nlargest solid waste discharged by industry, accounting for about 25% of industrial solid waste. \nIts  large  stockpiles  damage  mining  areas\u2019  ecology  and  occupy  valuable  land.  In  addition, \nspontaneous  combustion  within  these  heaps  causes  air  pollution  and  safety  hazards,  and \nleaching of trace elements with rainwater causes groundwater contamination.  \n \n3.  Currently, annual waste coal generation in PRC is around 200 million tons, which is \nalmost  equivalent  to  the  coal  production  in  the  Russian  Federation,  the  sixth-largest  coal \nproducer in the world. Accumulated waste coal in PRC was about 4.5 billion tons in 2008. \nShanxi Province, the largest coal-producing province, has accumulated about 1.1 billion tons of \nwaste coal, and its annual waste coal production is around 100 million tons.4 The utilization level \nof waste coal in Shanxi Province is only 50%, so environmental issues related to waste coal are \nmore acute here than in other provinces. Although waste coal use for power generation has \nbeen increasing due to government policies, technical and regulatory barriers still exist, which \nmay delay or impede large-scale waste coal use.  \n \n4.  The 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) for Energy Development in PRC requires that waste coal \nuse should increase to 390 million tons in 2010 from 150 million tons in 2005. Both the 11th \nFYP for Economic and Social Development and 11th FYP for Energy Development emphasize \nbuilding large-scale circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) boilers to control pollution from \nwaste coal heaps. According to the State Council\u2019s Opinion on Accelerating Development of a \nRecycling Economy and Shanxi Recycling Economy Development Plan under the 11th FYP, \nthere is an urgent need to develop the integrated use of waste coal from coal production for \nthermal power-generation. \n \n5.  In 2004, ADB provided a TA to promote waste coal use in Shanxi Province.5 The \nresulting study was completed in November 2006, and its main recommendations included \npromoting waste coal power generation and further study to determine the techno-economic \nfeasibility for large-scale (i.e., 600 MW and higher) waste coal power generation plants.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 12 May 2009.  \n2  China Electricity Council. 2009.

Manila. \n ", "2   \n6.  In the mid-1980s, waste coal power plants were established in PRC in sets of 6 MW. By \n2004, more than 200 waste coal power plants were built with an aggregate capacity of 4 \ngigawatts (GW), utilizing 40 million tons of waste coal to produce 24 TWh of electricity annually. \nThe largest plant, however, is only 300 MW. Looking ahead, to utilize even 50% of annual waste \ncoal (i.e., 150 million tons), a total capacity of 45 GW is needed. Therefore, more power plants \nare required\u2014located at every large coal mine\u2014that have the largest capacity that is technically \npossible. When the unit size is large, it is cost-effective to include designs that control pollution, \ncomply with national emission standards, and enable higher efficiency to increase financial \nreturns  and  reduce  carbon  dioxide  emissions.  Moreover,  new  emission  standards  of  air \npollutants for thermal power plants (GB13223-2003) stipulate stricter emission standards for \nwaste coal power plants, and only large waste coal power plants of about 600 MW range can \nachieve them.6  \n \n7.  Most modern coal-based power plants use (i) pulverized coal combustion (PCC), in \nwhich coal is finely ground so it can burn efficiently, and (ii) supercritical and ultra-supercritical \nsteam parameters. The most efficient units convert 42%\u201345% of the heat in coal to electricity.7 \nThe main drawbacks of PCC coal-based power plants are that their transformation and pollution \ncontrol  efficiencies  are  sensitive  to  changes  in  coal  quality,  the  cost  of  pollution  control \nequipment is high, and waste coal cannot be used efficiently because of variations in quality. \nSupercritical and ultra-supercritical coal-based power plants also require superior grade steel \ntubes, which result in higher boiler costs. Therefore, the appropriate design is CFBC. Although \ndevelopment of CFBC technology has been slow (presently, only 2% of the world\u2019s coal-based \npower plants use it), it is particularly suited for coal with lower heat content and high sulfur. The \nefficiency of its large-sized units (i.e., over 300 MW) can be similar to that of PCC units.  \n \n8.  Although  national  policies  encourage  waste  coal  power  plants,  the  policies  can  be \nimproved to simplify exemptions and reductions in income and value-added taxes for power \ngenerated from waste coal power plants. The State Council stipulates that such power plants \nshould get preference in selling power and the power sale price; power plants with capacities of \n12 MW or less are exempted from the grid load management and related fees.8 Still, coal mining \ncompanies and other power producers face obstacles in selling power to grids. Various fees are \ninvolved in power sale transactions,9 and there is a lack of a transparent and fair structure. \nPresently, the power generated by waste coal power plants can only be purchased by provincial \npower distributing companies, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of just two national grid \ncompanies.10 A prolonged and laborious process in negotiating power sales agreements with \noff-takers is also a serious barrier.   \n \n                                                 \n6  Smoke emission limit of 200 parts per million (ppm), sulfur dioxide emission limit of 800 ppm, and nitrogen oxide \nemission limit of 659 ppm. \n7  The efficiency range reflects different turbine designs and temperature of cooling water that is available at the site. \nIt requires 0.273 tons of standard coal (heat content 29.3 MJ per kilogram or 7,000 kcal per kilogram) to produce 1 \nmegawatt-hour of electricity when the efficiency is 45%, and the carbon dioxide emission will be 0.8 ton. In terms of \npollution control, it is possible to limit emissions to 200 ppm of sulfur dioxide(using flue gas desulfurization plants), \n \n200 ppm of nitrogen oxide (using selective catalytic converters), and 30 ppm of particulate matter. \n8  Due to the large size of PRC provincial power grids, smaller units (i.e., 100 MW and less) are technically incapable \nof influencing the system\u2019s frequency to short-term load changes. \n9  The  fees  include  the  grid  modification  and  connection  fee,  grid  support  fee,  generation  capacity  fee,  grid \nmanagement fee, and grid connection technical support fee. The local power authorities have the flexibility to \ndefine these fees.  \n10  The alternative is to build waste coal power plants for captive use of the coal mine, but this would restrict growth \nand fail to resolve the problem of accumulating waste coal heaps. \n ", "  3\n9.  Waste coal use will bring social and environmental benefits to local residents and coal \nmine workers such as (i) creating new jobs during power plant construction, operation, and \nassociated economic activities; (ii) eliminating harmful environmental contamination; and (iii) \nimproving public health, including quality of water and air in and around the Pingshuo mining \narea.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.   The impact of the TA will be reduced negative environmental impacts from waste coal \nheaps  in  Shanxi  Province.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  a  set  of  recommended  policy \nmeasures to increase waste coal use in Shanxi Province. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.   The TA will (i) provide a comprehensive utilization plan and policy recommendations for \nwaste  coal,  (ii)  introduce  advanced  energy-efficient  technologies  for  waste  coal  power \ngeneration and a technical due diligence report for a 600-MW waste coal power plant utilizing \nCFBC  technology  with  supercritical  steam  parameters,  and  (iii)  disseminate  knowledge  on \nadvanced energy-efficient technology for waste coal power generation.   \n \n12.  The activities consist of two components.  \n(i)  Component A: Development of a comprehensive plan for waste coal use \nand  policy  recommendations,  and  introduction  of  advanced  \nenergy-efficient technologies. This component will prepare a comprehensive \nutilization plan for waste coal for the Pingshuo coal mine in Shanxi Province. It \nwill  analyze  existing  policy  and  regulatory  frameworks  and  make \nrecommendations on policy measures to promote waste coal power generation. \nIt will analyze (a) existing technology of 600-MW supercritical CFBC and its key \ncomponents;  (b)  thermal  design  methods,  hydrodynamic  force  calculation \nmethods, technical feasibility of outside-sets of heat exchangers, and antirubbing \ntechnology for 600-MW supercritical CFBC chambers; and (c) boiler auxiliary \nequipment, its arrangement, and system for 600-MW CFBC within supercritical \nsteam parameters.  \n(ii)  Component B: Management and knowledge dissemination. This component \nwill manage implementation of components A and B, prepare a policy note by \nADB,  and  organize  workshops  with  major  provincial  coal  producers  and \ngovernment officials for knowledge dissemination.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $650,000 equivalent. ADB\u2019s TA funding program \n(Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund-Others)  will  finance,  on  a  grant  basis,  $500,000.  The \nGovernment will finance the remaining $150,000 equivalent through in-kind contributions. The \nproceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook. 11 The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2008.

The TA will be implemented over a period of 11 months, from October 2009 to August \n2010. \n \n15.  The  Executing  Agency  (EA)  will  be  the  Shanxi  Provincial  Finance  Bureau,  and  the \nimplementing agency (IA) will be Pingshuo Waste Coal Power Generation Co. Ltd. Both the EA \nand IA will provide access to relevant data, reports, and information, and provide logistical \nsupport12 and office space. For component B\u2014a critical knowledge-sharing component of the \nTA design\u2014all workshops, seminars, and conferences will be organized by the EA and IA in \nclose consultation with ADB.     \n \n16.  The TA will require 48 person-months of national consulting services. Required experts \ninclude  a  (i)  coal  engineer,  (ii)  economist,  (iii)  environment  specialist,  (iv)  boiler  design \nspecialist,  (v)  thermodynamics  specialist,  (vi)  dynamics  specialist,  (vii)  clean  combustion \nspecialist, (viii) material specialist, (ix) CFBC boiler debugging specialist, and (x) CFBC boiler \noperation specialist. Since waste coal utilization for large-scale power generation is a unique \nlocal problem to PRC\u2014especially Shanxi Province\u2014there is abundant local knowledge and \navailability  of  national  experts  to  undertake  TA  tasks.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n17.  The TA is intended to be delegated to the EA and IA. The consulting firm will be \nrecruited by the IA under the guidance of the EA in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) following quality- and cost-based \nselection in a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 for component A.
