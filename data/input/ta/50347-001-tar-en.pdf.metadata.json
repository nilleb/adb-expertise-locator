THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.   Dushanbe, the capital city of Tajikistan with an official population of 800,000, is a major \ncontributor to the national budget with its economic structure comprising of 70% services, 26% \nconstruction, and 4% industry. Migration from rural areas and the significant numbers of overseas \nworkers returning to Dushanbe1 has led to a population of more than a million (unofficial figures). \nThis resulted in unplanned expansion of urban areas with low density patterns and with limited \naccess to urban infrastructure and services.  \n \n2.  The proposed Dushanbe Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project will: (i) rehabilitate \nand expand water supply infrastructure and pilot district metering areas (DMAs) or smart block \nmanagement  with  pressure  reducing  valves  and  smart  meters  to  manage  water  demand, \npressure, and nonrevenue water (NRW) in a selected district of Dushanbe City; (ii) rehabilitate \nand  expand  the  sewerage  network  in  selected  districts  of  Dushanbe  City  and  undertake \nemergency  repairs  to  stop  seepage;  (iii)  establish  a  performance-oriented  management \ninformation system with the use of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system for \noperational efficiency and geographic information system (GIS) for asset management using \ncloud  computing  as  a  computing  platform  for  efficient  monitoring  of  DMAs  and  improved \noperational  and  business  efficient  service  delivery  by  the  State  Unitary  Enterprise \nDushanbevodokanal (SUE DVK); 2 and (iv) improve project implementation with an updated \norganizational management structure for an improved quality of life for citizens of Dushanbe. \nThese outputs will result in the following outcome: improved access to safe and affordable water \nsupply services in selected areas of Dushanbe improved. The project will be aligned with the \nfollowing impacts: (i) improved quality of life, urban resilience, and economic growth in Dushanbe \nand; (ii) universal access to safe and affordable drinking water by 2030.3 The ensuing loan and \nthe transaction technical assistance (TRTA) are listed in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ncountry operations business plan 2018-2020 for Tajikistan.4  \n \nII.

Project Background \n \n1.  Dushanbe, the capital city, has an official population of 800,000 but unofficially has almost \na million due to increased migration from rural areas and the significant numbers of overseas \nworkers returning to Dushanbe.1 Urban migration added stress to the aging urban infrastructure \nand led to unplanned expansion of the city with low density patterns and limited access to urban \nservices. This has led to environmental degradation resulting in high coping costs and poor city \nlivability for citizens and migrants, as well as limiting the economic growth prospects for the city. \nThe city initiated development of a masterplan to comprehensively plan investments to meet the \ndemands of the expanding population starting with water supply and sanitation.2 The water \nsupply  and  sanitation  systems  in  Dushanbe,  built  under  the  former  Soviet  Union,  have \ndeteriorated over the years due to a combination of age, lack of continued capital investment, \nand lack of proper operations and maintenance. The water supply system is characterized by \nintermittent operation, high nonrevenue water (NRW), low water pressures, and low energy \nefficiency. The  expanding  urban  areas  particularly  in  the  eastern  part  of the city  are  not \nconnected to the water and sewerage systems. The lack of public understanding to conserve \nwater as a natural resource, combined with low tariff, led to uncontrolled consumption and \nwastage of water. Water consumption is 330 liters per capita per day in Tajikistan.3  In addition, \nwater quality is poor and water contamination is frequent. Tajikistan has the second highest \nworldwide incidence of diarrhea in children aged 6 to 11 months and the ninth highest diarrhea \nmortality rate among children aged 1-5 years due to water-borne diseases.4 It is the most climate-\nvulnerable country in the region and the second least able to adapt.5   \n \n2.

The ensuing loan and the transaction technical assistance \n(TRTA) is listed in the ADB country operations business plan 2017-2019 for Tajikistan (footnote \n2). \n \n3.  Inadequate and inefficient water supply and sanitation.  \n(i)  Infrastructure. Dushanbe is supplied by water from four water treatment plants \nplaced in each quadrant of the city with a total capacity of 520,000 cubic meters \nper day (m3/day). The two in the north, Napornaya and Samotechnaya water \ntreatment plants with a capacity of 204,000 m3/day, use surface water sourced \nfrom the river Varzob at 16 km upstream from the city. The groundwater treatment \nplant located in the southeast part of the city in the floodplain of Kafarnigan river-\nKaferniganskaya pumping station was commissioned in 1972, and the Southwest \nwater treatment plant was built in 1977. Both rely on groundwater abstraction from \nthree wellfields comprising a total of 130 boreholes. The centralized water supply \nsystem  was  built  in  1932  and  extended  in  the  1970s.  It  comprises  of  682 \nkilometers (km) of pipelines, with 175 km of transmission mains, 282 km of main \npipelines and 225 km of distribution pipelines, and over 40 main line booster \npumping stations. The pipe materials are 56% steel, 36% cast iron, 7% plastic \nand 1% asbestos cement, and all require extensive rehabilitation. Expansion of \nthe system to unserved areas is also a critical need.  \n(ii)  Operation and maintenance. In Dushanbe, the water supply coverage is fairly \nhigh at 83%, but its service quality, reliability and supply pressure is low. Energy \ncost represents a significant part of operational expenditure. NRW is expected to \nbe  around  50%  because  of  high  physical  losses  from  the  deteriorated \ninfrastructure and commercial losses given the limited metering in the city.7 \nDisrupted supply conditions create daily shocks in the network that damage \nnetwork further and create potential sources of wastewater infiltration. High levels \nof  NRW lead to  low  levels  of  business  efficiency.  There  are  approximately \n187,000 registered customers of which only 76,500 are metered limiting the cost \nrecovery, user charges and sustainability of operations. NRW reduction using a \ndistrict  metering  area  or  a  smart  block  management  approach  will  enable \nsystematic operations.  \n(iii)  Institutional management. The responsibility for water supply and sanitation in \nDushanbe lies with the State Unitary Enterprise Dushanbevodokanal (SUE DVK). \nSUE DVK does not cover its operating or capital costs due to poor financial \nmanagement.  Capacity building  of counterpart staff towards  use  of  efficient \nmanagement and commercial practices is crucial for sustainable operations.  \n(iv)  Finance. Investment is inadequate for both capital and operational expenditure. \nThis is due to limited municipal revenue with nominal tariffs, limited metering, low \n                                                \n6  In collaboration with the Urban Sector Group, discussions are ongoing with Amazon Web Services for piloting cloud \ncomputing services for utility management and with the Japanese Space Agency for GIS and satellite imagery. \nCloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing power, database storage, applications, and other IT \nresources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. \n7  ADB. 2010. The Issues and Challenges of Reducing Non-Revenue Water. Manila. NRW is the difference between \nthe volume of water put into a water distribution system and the volume that is billed to customers. NRW comprises \nthree components: (i) physical losses\u2013comprise leakage from all parts of the system and overflows at the utility\u2019s \nreservoirs, (ii) commercial losses\u2013caused by customer meter under registration, data handling errors, and theft of \nwater in various forms, and (iii) unbilled authorized consumption\u2013includes water used by the utility for operational \npurposes, water used for firefighting, and water provided for free to certain consumer groups.  \n ", "Annex 2  3 \n \nbilling and collection efficiency, and high costs due to operating inefficiencies. \nUntil recently, tariff was based on a per person basis of estimated household size \nof four persons and not on volumetric consumption leading to excessive water \nconsumption and wastage. SUE DVK established the new tariffs for water supply \nand wastewater disposal services from 1 October 2016.8 The implementation of \nthe tariff structure and universal metering will be essential for sustainability of \ninvestments.  \n \n4.  Ongoing work. Due to poor upstream land management practices and climate change, \nlandslides are becoming more frequent increasing turbidity of the surface water while the ground \nwater  is  of  reasonable  quality.9  The  World  Bank  is  supporting  the  improvement  of  the \nSamotechnaya water treatment plant with a design capacity of 280,000 m3/day. The World Bank \nproject will introduce rapid gravity filters and re-chlorination systems to improve water quality. It \nalso supported the installation of bulk meters and 76,500 residential or household meters in the \nsouthern half of the city.10 \n \n5.  Sanitation. There is one sewerage network and wastewater treatment plant built in \n1970s and has undergone some upgrades with replacement of pumping units and rehabilitation \nof sedimentation tanks. The sewerage system is separate, without storm water entry, and \noperates entirely under gravity conditions. SUE DVK estimates that 60% of the population is \nconnected to the sewerage system and those that are not use septic tanks. The wastewater \ntreatment plant has both physical and biological facilities but only the physical facilities are \nworking. The project will rehabilitate the sewerage network and upgrade wastewater treatment \nplant in the selected districts of the city.  \n \n6.  Climate Change vulnerability. Tajikistan is the most climate-vulnerable country in the \nregion and the second least able to adapt. This is due to decreasing glacier water reservoirs, \nhigh agricultural and urban water consumption, high levels of environmental degradation, land \nerosion, deforestation rates, and deteriorating social infrastructure (footnote 5). Tajikistan is the \nonly country in Central and West Asia where the water security score has reduced in 2016 since \n2013 (footnote 3) raising the need for efficient use of water. Some of the impacts on water supply \nand sanitation are: (i) increased turbidity of surface water requiring better sedimentation and \nfiltration in surface water treatment plants, (ii) seepages from septic tanks and pit latrines, and \n(iii) the flooding of sanitation systems contaminating flood waters. Climate change adaptation \nneeds for the water supply sector include reducing surface water reliance by diversifying water \nsources to improve water security, NRW reduction, and increased efficiency in operations and \nmaintenance.  \n \n7.  The proposed Dushanbe Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project will: (i) rehabilitate \nand expand climate-resilient water supply distribution network, piloting  district metering areas \n                                                \n8  Government of the Republic of Tajikistan. 2016.

Strengthening institutional development towards efficient, transparent management and \nfinancial control through the introduction of modern information technologies at all levels of \ngovernment have been highlighted in the National Development Strategy 2030.12 The project will \npilot the innovative use of high level technologies such as cloud computing for a performance-\noriented management information system with financial and asset management. The project will \nsupport universal metering and expansion of a citywide modern billing and collection system to \nimprove customer service and cost recovery, aligned with ongoing projects to ensure donor \ncoordination.  The  project  will  use  GIS  and  satellite  imagery  for  asset  management.  The \noperational efficiency will be improved with SCADA system installation for bulk flow meters \nenabling systematic water production metering, monitoring, and reporting. The project will \nprovide capacity development for SCADA and GIS training to operate a computer based \nmonitoring system using updated operations procedures such as active leak detection and \nrepair, and pressure management.  \n \n9.  The project will include a communication component that aims to mobilize youth-led \noutreach efforts to promote the new level of services developed and its impact on health, \nbehavior change for more efficient water usage and conservation, and better sanitation practices \namong various stakeholders. This will result in an overall decrease in the volume of water \nabstracted from the source rivers and groundwater aquifers, thereby reducing vulnerability to \nclimate change and increasing urban  water resilience. It will also reduce energy demand \ncontributing to climate mitigation. The project will reduce the significant coping cost incurred by \ncitizens. The proposed improvements will contribute to the reduction of water-borne diseases by \npreventing the ingress of contaminated water into the distribution system.  \n \n10.  The outputs of the project will be:  \n(i)  Rehabilitated and expanded climate-resilient water supply in a pilot district \nmetering area of Dushanbe City including the rehabilitation and expansion of \n                                                \n11 In collaboration with the Urban Sector Group, discussions are ongoing with Amazon Web Services for piloting cloud \ncomputing services for utility management and with the Japanese Space Agency for GIS and satellite imagery. \nCloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing power, database storage, applications, and other IT \nresources through a cloud services platform via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. \n12 Government of Republic of Tajikistan. 2016.
