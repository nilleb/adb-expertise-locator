INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states inaugurated the \nASEAN Economic Community (AEC) along with the AEC Blueprint 20251 at the Kuala Lumpur \nLeaders\u2019 Summit in November 2015\u20148 years after the endorsement of the first AEC Blueprint \n2015. The AEC Blueprint 2015 has acted as the master plan in guiding the region\u2019s process of \nmarket integration and competiveness improvement. It was built on four interrelated pillars: (i) a \nsingle market and production base that enjoys the free flow of goods, services, investment, \ncapital,  and  skilled  labor;  (ii)  a  competitive  economic  region;  (iii)  equitable  economic \ndevelopment; and (iv) integration with the global economy.2  \n \n2.  The proposed regional technical assistance (TA) is included in the Regional Cooperation \nand Integration Pipeline for Southeast Asia, 2015\u20132017 and is consistent with the priorities of \nstrengthening regional cooperation and integration and competitiveness in the following country \npartnership strategies: 3 2014\u20132018 for Cambodia; 2012\u20132016 for the Lao People's Democratic \nRepublic (Lao PDR); 2011\u20132016 for the Philippines; and 2016\u20132019 for Indonesia.4 It supports \nthe Midterm Review of Strategy 2020.5 In response to requests from the governments, the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  fielded  AEC  assessment  consultation  missions  to  Cambodia, \nIndonesia, the Lao PDR, and the Philippines from October 2015 to July 2016. The missions met \nwith country counterparts and discussed (i) the status and challenges faced in implementing the \nAEC  commitments;  (ii)  the  needs,  broad  scope,  costs,  implementation  arrangements;  and  \n(iii) the technical support required. Each country confirmed that AEC is a high priority and \nconfirmed their interest in participating in the TA. Regular consultations would be maintained \nduring TA preparation and implementation. The design and monitoring framework is outlined in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  By the AEC inauguration in November 2015, the ASEAN member states (AMSs) had \neliminated most intra-ASEAN tariffs and had partially established the ASEAN trade repository to \ndocument trade and customs laws, and procedures to improve transparency. The AMSs signed \nthe ASEAN Comprehensive Investment Agreement with the objective of building a regional \ninvestment area. Under the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Services, services liberalization \ncommitments, representing a coverage ratio from 70% to 84% of total services subsectors, were \nconcluded. To promote the movement of skilled labor, eight mutual recognition arrangements on \nprofessional services were signed.6 By the end of 2015, the majority of AMSs had passed \ncompetition laws to enhance market efficiency and provide firms equal opportunities to compete \nin the ASEAN markets. Several countries also introduced good regulatory practices and started \nto  conduct  regulatory  impact  assessments  (RIAs),  albeit  at  varying  scales  and  scopes. \n                                                \n1  ASEAN. 2015. ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2025. Jakarta. \n  http://www.asean.org/storage/images/2015/November/aec-page/AEC-Blueprint-2025-FINAL.pdf   \n2  Under Blueprint 2025, the four pillars were renamed as \u201cfive characteristics,\u201d i.e.,(i) highly integrated and cohesive \neconomy; (ii) competitive, innovative, and dynamic ASEAN; (iii) enhanced connectivity and sectoral development; \n(iv)  resilient,  inclusive,  people-oriented  ASEAN;  and  (v) global  ASEAN.  Reforms  in each  characteristic  are \ngenerally mapped to the original pillars under Blueprint 2015.  \n3  ADB.  2014.  Country  Partnership  Strategy:  Cambodia,  2014\u20132018.

Progress in AEC implementation also varies, with Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand as \nthe  most  advanced;  followed  by  Indonesia,  the  Philippines,  and  Viet  Nam.  While  making \nsignificant headway, Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Myanmar still have a lot to do to catch up. \nBridging these gaps remains a major challenge, but it is crucial for AEC to be able to benefit all \ncountries. \n \n4.  Restricted  regional  movement.  The  regional  movement  of  goods,  services, \ninvestment, capital, and skilled labor are still subject to many restrictions, which are often \nembedded in the national policies, rules, and regulations. This hinders AEC benefits, especially \nfurther growth of regional trade and investment, in four ways. First, the services trade in ASEAN \nis far more restrictive than the global average and more than in East Asia, among which the \nPhilippines has the most restrictive policy regime with a services trade restrictive index of 53, \nfollowed by Indonesia at 50.8 Challenges  increase when AEC commitments require amending \ndomestic laws or, in some cases, national constitutions.9 The movement of skilled labor is \nsubject to many domestic constraints, such as labor markets tests to determine no qualified \nnationals available to fill those positions, permits, and visa requirements. Second, ambitions to \nestablish  open  and transparent  investment  regimes  are  thwarted  by  the  list  of  investment \nrestrictions that countries maintain and the wide use of investment incentive schemes. Third, \nprogress  has  been  slow  in  rationalizing  nontariff  measures,  with  their  numbers  increasing \nalmost four-fold between 2000 and 2015 as tariffs got lower.10 Fourth, the seamless movement \nof capital is difficult, partly due to varying degrees of capital market development within the \nregion as well as the policy of AMSs to maintain domestic financial stability. Cambodia and the \nLao PDR are not members of the International Organization of Securities Commissions. Policy \nmakers in some ASEAN countries face an important task of formulating practical actions by \nassessing and comprehending the implications of AEC integration (especially that of selected \nservices sectors, e.g., tourism, education, health care, logistics, civil aviation, shipping, and \ninvestment)  in  national  economies  as  well  as  communicating  with  stakeholders  to  gauge \nsupport for reforms.  \n \n5.  Complex and inefficient regulatory regimes. An important element of AEC is for each \nAMS to introduce competition laws as an integral component of policy aimed at ensuring fair \ncompetition, following a set of common ASEAN guidelines. Another key AEC target is for AMSs \nto align and harmonize their regulatory frameworks. Until 2014, only five AMSs had enacted \ncompetition laws, with the Philippines and the Lao PDR enacting competition laws in 2015. The \nPhilippines established the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) in 2016. Cambodia plans \n                                                \n7   ADB  conducted  country-based  AEC  assessments  in  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  the  Lao  PDR,  Myanmar,  the \nPhilippines, and Viet Nam in 2016. In spite of the different pace in implementation, all countries have gaps in \nmeeting AEC commitments. The assessments found more time and consultations are needed to outline the scope \nof assistance for Myanmar and Viet Nam; therefore, they will be included in the next regional TA. \n8    According to the World Bank\u2019s ASEAN Integration Monitoring Report (2013), the six ASEAN countries (Cambodia, \nIndonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam) had an average  services trade restrictive index of \n44 in 2012, which is higher (i.e., more restrictive) than East Asia at 41 and the world average level at 29. \n9   AEC targeted at least 70% equity cap by the end of 2015. In the Philippines, the constitution has economic \nprovisions that cap foreign equity participation in public utility and some services sectors to 40%. \n10  The Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia, in collaboration with the United Nations Conference \non Trade and Development and the national teams from the ASEAN countries, completed the comprehensive \nstocktaking of nontariff measures, and will continue this work in 2017. The findings on nontariff measures can be \nfound on the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia website.  \n ", "  3 \nto enact its Competition Law by the end of 2016. Cambodia and the Lao PDR have introduced a \nRIA process and the Philippines has started RIA pilots, but this is only the first step. Many \ndaunting challenges remain in implementing competition policies and regulatory reforms in \nASEAN\u2014both of which are difficult to reform because they are national in application.   \n \n6.  Monitoring progress. Systematic monitoring of the AEC implementation progress is \nchallenging. Under Blueprint 2015, AEC implementation was addressed through a strategic \nschedule, covering over 500 individual actions. A scorecard was used to track AEC measures \nimplemented from 2008. However, only an aggregated figure across all AMSs is available from \n2011,  and  it  is  difficult  to  ascertain  real  progress.  Under  Blueprint  2025,  monitoring  and \nevaluation will be enhanced, with the AEC Council as the principal body overseeing overall \nimplementation. In August 2016, the 48th ASEAN Economic Ministers endorsed a few key \nsectoral strategic action plans (SAPs) and work plans covering goods, services, investment, and \ncompetition. AMS governments need to work closely with the AEC Council and its committees \nto translate Blueprint 2025 and individual SAPs into national plans.11 In this process, additional \ncountry support is necessary to formulate national plans and strengthen national monitoring.   \n \n7.  ADB has had a long engagement with AMSs on regional integration both at the ASEAN \nlevel and in various subregional initiatives as the lead development partner on (i) TA and grant \nprojects covering trade (facilitation); (ii) national policy-based loans promoting economic policy \nreforms and capacity development, such as competition policy and RIAs; and (iii) knowledge \nproducts  on  ASEAN  integration,  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion,  the  Brunei  Darussalam\u2013\nIndonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines  East  ASEAN  Growth  Area,  and  the  Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013\nThailand Growth Triangle.12 These interventions have generated the technical knowledge, built \nup collaboration between ADB and the governments, and laid the basis for consolidated support \nin AEC integration. The TA support  will help plan and prepare the ASEAN-wide programmatic \napproach for AEC support program by developing national agendas for policy dialogues across \nhigh-impact areas including trade, services, investments, competition policy, and RIAs with the \nrespective  governments;  supporting  capacity  development;  and  strengthening  country-level \nmonitoring of AEC. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA impact is a more dynamic and competitive region with a single market and \nproduction base achieved, which is aligned with Blueprint 2025 (footnote 1). The TA outcome is \nimplementation of the AEC commitments in priority areas improved.  \n \n                                                \n11  Footnote 1, p. 37.

This TA will have three outputs, mainly covering activities falling under characteristics 1 \nand  2  of  Blueprint  2025  (footnote  2).  These  outputs  will  provide  the  analyses  and \nrecommendations  that can  potentially  feed  into  the  preparation  of  a regional  ASEAN-wide \nprogrammatic  approach  of  an  AEC  support  program.  During  implementation,  unforeseen \nchanges in the domestic political situations in participating governments may alter their priorities \nwith regard to their earlier commitments, and the TA will need to adapt accordingly. Lack of \nparticipation and coordination among key agencies may also delay AEC implementation and \nreforms. \n \n10.  Output 1: Action plans and/or road maps to participate in the ASEAN Economic \nCommunity prepared. Based on the findings of the AEC assessments and in response to the \nrequests from countries, this output will support the preparation of diagnostics and/or technical \nreports, leading to the drafting or strengthening of time-bound action plans and/or road maps \nunder national agendas. This includes improving the trade and investment environment, and \nstrengthening sector competitiveness (e.g., to gain access to and benefit from regional markets) \nto enable countries to better utilize AEC\u2019s opportunities and to inform the preparation of policy-\nbased lending programs for AEC.    \n \n11.  Output 2: Capacity to implement the ASEAN Economic Community commitments \nin  priority  areas  developed.  This  output  will  support  AEC  initiatives,  which  have  been \nidentified  through  country  consultations  and  AEC  assessments  on  (i)  trade  in  services;  \n(ii) investments; (iii) skilled labor; and (iv) competition law and policies, including RIAs. It will \nalso support the action plans prepared under output 1. Under items (i) and (ii), the TA will \nfinance selective technical and/or impact studies and capacity-building activities on trade in \nservices and the investment regimes in Cambodia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.13 These \nanalytical studies will support the governments to pursue pro-competitive reforms to improve \ntransparency and lower transaction costs. Under item (iii), the TA will support mapping of the \nprocess of selective mutual recognition arrangements in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao PDR, \nand  the  Philippines  to  identify  implementation  constraints,  such  as  permits  and  visa \nrequirements. Under item (iv), the TA will support the Philippines to implement the competition \nlaw  and  conduct  RIAs.  The TA  will  support the  newly  established  PCC  to  implement the \nPhilippine Competition Law. The TA will also support the Government of the Philippines to step \nup efforts to promote good regulatory practices by conducting additional pilot RIAs, and to make \nthe National Economic and Development Authority the gatekeeper of a national rollout of RIAs \nacross all agencies. Support for RIAs in Cambodia and the Lao PDR are provided by ongoing \nADB assistance.14  \n \n12.  Output  3:  Monitoring  and  evaluation  of  ASEAN  Economic  Community \nimplementation  at  the  country  level  strengthened.  Under  Blueprint  2025,  the  ASEAN \nSecretariat will monitor and track the implementation of SAPs through an enhanced monitoring \nframework, which is still under discussion. At the request of countries, this output will support \nthe governments to strengthen their own monitoring and evaluation systems at the country \n                                                \n13  A new TA on economic policy support for sustainable development goals for the Lao PDR is under preparation \nand will cover assistance with investment and services issues.  \n14  ADB. 2014.

Cost and Financing  \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $2 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  its  Southeast  Asia  Department  will  be \nresponsible for the administration and supervision of the TA.15 The TA will commence  on  \n1 December 2016 and be completed by 31 December 2020. In the Philippines, the Department \nof Finance will coordinate TA activities. The National Economic and Development Authority, the \nDepartment of Trade and Industry, the PCC, and the Professional Regulation Commission will \nparticipate in TA activities. In Indonesia, the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs will \ncoordinate TA activities, while the Ministry of Trade, Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board \n(BKPM),  the  Ministry  of  Manpower  (Professional  Certification  Authority),  and  the  National \nDevelopment Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) will participate in TA activities. In Cambodia, the \nMinistry of Commerce will coordinate TA activities, and the Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts \nwill participate in the TA activities. In the Lao PDR, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will \ncoordinate TA activities, and the Ministry of Planning and Investment will participate in TA \nactivities. In all countries, the coordinating agencies will also be responsible for disseminating \ninformation  and  coordinating  the  involvement  of  other  agencies.  In  each  country,  the \ngovernment counterpart agencies are expected to provide office space, and a core team, led by \na senior official in each participating agency, to guide and work with the consultants and ADB.  \n  \n15.  One  consulting  firm  (4  international  consultants,  24  person-months;  18  national \nconsultants, 39 person-months) will be engaged using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod (90:10 ratio, simplified technical proposal) to provide services on strategy development, \nimpact  studies,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  Individual  consultants  (5  international,  \n28 person-months; 6 national, 40 person-months) will be engaged to provide services related to \ncompetition policy and RIA as these areas are highly specialized and the tasks are more \nsuitable for being carried out by individuals independently. ADB will engage the consultants in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).  The  TA  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The consultants under the firm \ncontract will submit the following to ADB and TA participating agencies: (i) an inception report,  \n(ii) progress reports, and (iii) a draft final report and a final report. The individual consultants will \nsubmit technical reports as outlined in the terms of reference. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor Support to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n                                                \n15  Coordination within ADB, including with the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department and the       \nEconomic Cooperation and Research Department, will be maintained throughout TA implementation. \n   \n ", "6       Appendix 1               \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is aligned with \nA more dynamic and competitive region with single market and production base achieved (AEC Blueprint \n2025).a \n \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2021:     \n       \nImplementation of the  a.
