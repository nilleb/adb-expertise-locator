INTRODUCTION \n1.  On 8 September 2016, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved its first regional \ncooperation  and  integration  (RCI)  operational  plan  to  provide  guidance  for  ADB\u2019s  RCI \noperations in assisting developing member countries (DMCs) to harness increased benefits \nthrough improved cooperation and integration. 1 It also aims to strengthen ADB\u2019s institutional \ncapacity to lead in advancing RCI based on a larger, more innovative RCI portfolio and high-\nquality RCI implementation. \n \n2.  The  RCI  operational  plan  has  three  operational  directions:  (i)  stronger  connectivity \nbetween  economies  through  improved  cross-border  physical  infrastructure,  complementary \nsoftware,  and  finance  to  increase  market  access;  (ii)  improved  growth  and  business \ncompetitiveness  in  regional  markets  through  new  opportunities  in  cross-border  trade, \ninvestment, technology, finance, and labor mobility; and (iii) strengthened regional public goods \nand collective action for cooperative multicountry mechanisms, including health, environmental \nand financial risk, and resilience to external shocks. The technical assistance (TA) will support \nthe  implementation  of  the  operational  direction  2  on  raising  competitiveness  in  connected \nmarkets through the facilitation of inter-subregional foreign direct investment (FDI) flows.2 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Many  studies  have  been  conducted  over  the  past  three  decades  to  examine  the \nrelationship  between  FDI  and  economic  growth.3 Although  the  adverse  effects  of  FDI  on \neconomic growth have been cited in some studies, many theoretical and empirical models have \nimplied that overall FDI is beneficial for a host country's development as a stable and reliable \nsource of finance as compared with portfolio capital flows, particularly if the host country has a \ncertain level of absorptive capacity.4 This view has been widely accepted by policy makers. \n \n4.  Within  Asia,  domestic  reforms  coupled  with  RCI  have  created  opportunities  for \nincreasing the flow of FDI across borders, contributing to more efficient resource allocation and \nthe enhancement of economic growth. As a result, intraregional FDI now comprises 53% of total \nAsian FDI inflows. This is mostly due to the continued increase in FDI from East Asia. Regional \nproduction networks, mainly between multinational enterprises from Japan, the Republic of \nKorea, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and Southeast Asia, have served as drivers of \nintraregional investments, providing FDI opportunities in production processes. This has been \nenabled by ongoing efforts to improve transportation infrastructure and trade facilitation. \n \n5.  Changes  in  national  labor  costs  and  the  maturing  of  production  networks  in  more \ndeveloped Asian countries such as the PRC have been driving multinational enterprises to \nmove labor-intensive production and final goods assembly processes to lower-income countries \nin South Asia and Southeast Asia. Such movement of industries linked to resource-seeking FDI \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020: Promoting Connectivity, \nCompetitiveness, Regional Public Goods, and Collective Action for Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n2  Subregion refers to the geographic area covered by an ADB regional department (e.g., East Asia).  \n3  For example: M. A. Almfraji and M. K. Almsafir. 2014. Foreign Direct Investment and Economic Growth Literature \nReview from 1994 to 2012. Procedia \u2013 Social and Behavioral Sciences. 129. pp. 206\u2013213; E. Borenszteim, J. De \nGregorio, and J.W. Lee. 1998. How Does Foreign Direct Investment Affect Growth? Journal of International \nEconomics. 45 (1). pp. 115\u2013135. \n4  Advantages often cited include additional capital, domestic investment, corporate tax revenues, employment, \npromotion of competition, access to international markets, and positive externalities in the form of technology and \nskills transfer. These could boost productivity, employment, export competitiveness, trade, and economic growth. \n ", "2    \n \nhas begun to better employ excess regional savings to finance infrastructure and other needs of \ncapital-starved countries. With the PRC having a big share of Asian FDI, efforts of other Asian \ncountries to secure FDI have picked up in recent years. More developed Asian countries have \nbeen seeking investment opportunities in emerging Asian markets as they aim to boost growth, \nthus leading to cooperation opportunities among developing and industrialized countries in Asia. \n \n6.  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)5 plus Australia, the PRC, India, \nJapan, the Republic of Korea, and New Zealand (ASEAN+6) account for almost 50% of the \nworld\u2019s population and over 25% of world exports.6 In 2015, ASEAN+6 generated 31% of global \ngross domestic product, but accounted for just 19% of global FDI inflows. FDI in ASEAN+6 is \ndominated by ASEAN and the PRC, the two largest recipients in the developing world, together \nholding 70% of the group\u2019s FDI stock in 2015.7 Intra-ASEAN+6 investment accounts for about \n30% of FDI flows to ASEAN+6 and is expected to remain a major source of FDI (footnote 7). \n \n7.  Against this backdrop, an assessment of the impact of efforts by ASEAN+6 to forge a \nnew  free  trade  agreement  known  as  the  Regional  Comprehensive  Economic  Partnership \n(RCEP) on enhancing intraregional FDI flows assumes particular importance.8 This is especially \nso given the reduced prospects for Trans-Pacific Partnership ratification, and the continuing \nslowdown  in  global  and  regional  trade  growth.  ADB  has  conducted  studies  on  regional \ninfrastructure and trade between East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia.9 However, not \nmuch work has been done on FDI flows between these different parts of Asia. While official \ndiscussions on RCEP are ongoing, it is imperative to undertake a study on the effectiveness of \nthe provisions in enhancing FDI flows among RCEP countries given recent trade challenges \nand RCEP region opportunities. Since it is unclear when RCEP negotiations will be concluded \nwith a final text, it will be necessary to undertake an assessment using (i) an optimum high-\nquality FDI-enhancing scenario based on the impact of existing ASEAN+110 bilateral investment \ntreaties and free trade agreements on FDI flows, researching the correlation between FDI flows \nand agreements; and (ii) a likely scenario, if a lowest common denominator approach is adopted. \n \n8.  While the importance of FDI drivers and determinants have been assessed in studies,11 \nthere has been scant analysis of the extent to which small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \ncan help generate FDI flows in response to these drivers, particularly by taking advantage of \ntrade agreement provisions such as those in RCEP. In the last decade or so, more SMEs have \n                                                \n5  ASEAN comprises Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia,     \nMyanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n6  Government  of  Australia,  Department  of  Foreign  Affairs  and  Trade.

London: ADB / Palgrave Macmillan. \n10 ASEAN plus 1 partner (e.g., ASEAN-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement).   \n11 Research studies have identified factors that drive companies to undertake FDI. These motivations could be \ngrouped into: (i) natural resource-seeking FDI to gain access to natural resources not available in the multinational \ncompany\u2019s home, (ii) market-seeking FDI to tap into a foreign customer base and export markets, (iii) efficiency-\nseeking FDI to reduce production costs by gaining access to new technologies or competitively priced inputs, and \n(iv) strategic asset-seeking FDI to gain access to foreign strategic assets. However, investment climate plays a \ncritical overall role in determining how multinational enterprises respond to these FDI drivers. \n ", "  3 \nbegun to internationalize, and FDI has become an important vehicle for SMEs\u2019 participation in \ninternational  activities.  Thus,  SMEs\u2019  role  in  providing  intraregional  FDI  and,  consequently, \nstimulating inclusive growth and development via increased employment, greater innovation, \npartnership with local companies, backward linkages, and adaptation of technology to local \nneeds  has  to  be  further  explored.  Issues  affecting  SMEs  (including  enterprise-specific \nconstraints to SMEs\u2019 internationalization, the extent of regional financial integration, and issues \nrelated to provisions such as investor-to-state dispute settlement for which SMEs are usually at \na disadvantage) need to be scrutinized to identify the policies and incentives that potential host \ncountries need to provide to entice SMEs to invest in their countries. In this context, ASEAN+6, \nwith its rich tradition of open regionalism and generation of FDI, offers a fertile testing ground for \nan assessment of factors affecting SMEs\u2019 investment decisions. \n \n9.  This TA will (i) assess the likely impact of investment and other FDI-related provisions in \nthe  draft  RCEP  agreement  for  enhanced  FDI  flows  in  ASEAN+6;  (ii)  identify  barriers  to \nenhanced SMEs\u2019 FDI flows between ASEAN+6 countries; and (iii)  propose policy reforms, \ncapacity development programs, and private sector transactional support to translate likely \nRCEP provisions and the potential internationalization of SMEs into enhanced FDI flows in the \nASEAN+6 countries, particularly SME-driven FDI for agriculture, manufacturing, and services. \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be enhanced economic linkages between East Asia, Southeast Asia, and \nSouth Asia. The outcome will be the promotion of inter-subregional FDI flows, especially by \nSMEs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA\u2019s three key outputs are detailed in paras. 12\u201315. \n \n12.  Output  1:  Regional  Comprehensive  Economic  Partnership  agreement  impact \nanalysis  completed.12 This  background  paper  will  assess  the  likely  impact  of  the  RCEP \nagreement in facilitating FDI flows between ASEAN+6 countries as well as flows from outside \nASEAN+6. Apart from assessing the impacts of provisions on FDI in the RCEP agreement \n(expected to conclude in 2017), the background paper will examine how the formation of the \nRCEP as a regional block would likely affect FDI flows, specifically from outside Asia and the \nPacific. Impacts on FDI based on two scenarios\u2014best case or optimal, and a most likely case\u2014\nwill be assessed. The background paper will also undertake a literature review and synthesize \nthe empirical findings of the studies that have examined the likely impacts on FDI and related \nflows as a result of the RCEP formation. It will also analyze the levels of FDI flows by sector to \nprovide a basis for the selection of source countries for the survey and destination countries. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  foreign  investors  survey \ncompleted.13 This  enterprise-level  survey  will  determine  the  likely  determinant factors  and \nimpact in the RCEP region of SME internationalization for FDI in different sectors (agriculture, \nmanufacturing,  and  services).  Activities  will  include  (i)  mapping  SME  investors  in  RCEP \n                                                \n12 To build on existing work and minimize duplication, the analysis will draw on findings of studies on FDI by ADB and \nthe relevant chapter of ADB. Forthcoming. Asian Economic Integration Report 2016. Manila. \n13 This output will draw from ADB. 2014. Asia SME Finance Monitor 2013. Manila and ADB. 2015. Asia SME Finance \nMonitor 2014. Manila. \n ", "4    \n \ncountries, identifying the types of such SMEs by assessing (a) the characteristics of SMEs able \nto  participate  in  global  value  chains,  and  (b)  the  characteristics  of  SMEs  that  seek  to \ninternationalize  on  their  own;  (ii)  analyzing  constraints  to  SMEs\u2019  internationalization;  (iii) \ndesigning an SMEs\u2019 investors survey (covering three selected source countries and the three \nsectors); and (iv) conducting the survey in three source countries (one country for each sector) \nin consultation with business associations, chambers of commerce, and think tanks in the \nsource countries together with ADB Institute inputs. The survey results will be used to identify \nRCEP provisions that need to be tailored to help SMEs address barriers to FDI and provide the \ntransactional and policy reform support to maximize the effectiveness of investment facilitation \nstrategies for this neglected segment of investors and boost SMEs\u2019 internationalization. \n  \n14.  The background paper (output 1) and the findings of the SMEs\u2019 foreign investors survey \n(output 2) will be discussed at an RCI roundtable conference scheduled for the second half of \n2017 and subject to peer review at the conference before a policy working paper, based on the \nTA findings, is submitted to the ASEAN Secretariat for purposes of ongoing RCEP discussions \nand implementation. The survey findings will act as enterprise-level input for subsequent (i) \ninvestment facilitation policy dialogue with select destination countries in the RCEP region; (ii) \nsupport services needed to stimulate SMEs\u2019 participation in international markets; and (iii) FDI \ntransactional  support  dialogue  (private  sector  loans,  investments,  and/or  guarantees)  with \npotential SMEs surveyed in the investor survey. \n \n15.  Output  3:  Sectoral  foreign  direct  investment  facilitation  paper  completed.  The \nsectoral FDI facilitation paper will identify public policy reforms, capacity development programs, \nand private sector transactional support for FDI driven by SMEs for agriculture, manufacturing, \nand services in three selected ASEAN+6 DMCs. These DMCs will represent a geographically \ndiversified range of low-income and middle-income countries, and will be selected after the first \ntwo outputs have been presented at the RCI roundtable conference.14 Those outputs will be \nused as a basis for identifying FDI-enhancing RCEP provisions and key constraints of SMEs\u2019 \nFDI actors in the RCEP country grouping, which need to be addressed in FDI destination \ncountries in the RCEP country grouping by (i) negotiation of RCEP provisions; (ii) policy and \ninstitutional reforms to be pursued through local business associations and policy dialogue; and \n(iii) transactional support in the form of private sector investment, loans, and/or guarantees for \nSMEs  seeking to  invest  overseas,  including  at  least  a  nonsovereign RCI  project  involving \nASEAN+6 countries to be considered for possible financing.15  \n \n16.  Potential risks to successful TA implementation are major changes in global, regional, \nand country environments that would adversely affect priorities and policies, and therefore the \nprospects for RCI and enhanced FDI. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                \n14 Country partnership strategies and operational documents will be used as a basis for selection. To maximize the \nTA\u2019s development impact, countries with a small population base where nonsovereign interventions are relatively \nrisky as well as countries with large markets will be considered for selection as destination countries. \n15 ADB  assistance  on  investment  policy  reform  will  be  taken  into  account  in  formulating  policy  reform \nrecommendations. \n ", "  5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months from December 2016 to June 2018. The \nRCI  Thematic  Group  Secretariat  in  ADB\u2019s  Economic  Research  and  Regional  Cooperation \nDepartment will serve as the overall coordinator and be responsible for administering and \nsupervising the TA. The RCI Thematic Group Secretariat will take lead responsibility for outputs \n1 and 2, and ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department for output 3. The TA team will work \nclosely with other Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department divisions (the \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Division and the Economic Analysis and Operational \nSupport Division) by drawing on their work and seeking technical contributions. The TA team \nwill  seek  inputs  from  the  East  Asia  Department,  South  Asia  Department,  Southeast  Asia \nDepartment, Private Sector Operations Department, Public\u2013Private Partnership Thematic Group, \nRCI Thematic Group, Finance Sector Group, and ADB Institute to enhance the operational \nrelevance of the analytical work. Partnership will be explored with a center of excellence, which \nis expected to provide research inputs, co-organize events, and review major TA outputs.16   \n \n19.  The TA will require 2 person-months of individual international consultancy services from \nan international trade economist and/or macroeconomist and an international trade lawyer. \nHiring individual consultants will be more beneficial because of ADB\u2019s faster mobilization and \ngreater control in selecting experts. Outputs 2 and 3 will require a consulting firm providing \ninternational experts (5 person-months) with experience and a track record in (i) designing and \nconducting enterprise surveys and SMEs\u2019 FDI in agriculture, manufacturing, and services; and \n(ii) structuring of private sector proofs of concept. The firm will be recruited through quality- and \ncost-based selection using a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. Biodata technical proposal will be \nrequired. The TA will also require 24 person-months of individual national consultancy services \ncomprising 12 person-months for a research associate and 12 person-months for a project \ncoordinator. Resource persons will review draft studies and serve as facilitators for meetings. \n \n20.  Recruitment of consultants will be undertaken in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for \nthe consultants are in Appendix 3. Disbursement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nComplementary inputs will be provided by the government and/or other TA providing agencies. \nA no-objection letter from the governments of the DMCs included in the TA will be obtained \nbefore commencing or financing of the proposed activities in the territory of a DMC. \n \n21.  The TA findings and recommendations will be contained in a publication to be completed \nby mid-2018. Good practices and lessons from the TA will be shared through RCI Thematic \nGroup knowledge events and posted on the RCI Thematic Group website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nFacilitating  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises  Foreign  Direct  Investment  Flows:  An \nASEAN+6 Case Study, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n16The center of excellence will be an internationally recognized regional thought leader on FDI, advocate for trade in   \nAsia, and expert on regional trade agreements, including the RCEP. \n  \n \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Technical Assistance is Aligned With \nEconomic linkages between East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia enhanced (Operational Plan for \nRCI, 2016\u20132020)a \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nInter-subregional FDI  a.
