I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment in Aureos South Asia Fund, L.L.C. (the Fund) of up to $17.5 million or 25% of \nthe Fund\u2019s total share capital, whichever is less. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: BACKGROUND, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n2.  The story of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in South Asia is one of great \nopportunity and great constraint. Although economic conditions differ widely in India, Sri Lanka, \nand Bangladesh1, the SME sector shows great promise within the region. In India, this promise \nderives from significant economic expansion and an SME sector poised to take off in response \nto increased demand. In Sri Lanka, it takes the form of new opportunities and new optimism for \nthe SME sector following the end of decades of violence and unrest. In Bangladesh, where \nSMEs have been constrained by a volatile political and economic landscape, opportunities exist \nfor opportunistic firms to make true gains in productivity and efficiency if given the financial and \nhuman  resources  they  need.  In  all  three  economies,  the  promise  of  the  SME  sector  is \nconstrained by the lack of availability of appropriate financing modalities to fund expansion and \nimprovement. This lack of financing, and in particular the dearth of private equity funding, serves \nas the Fund\u2019s context for a business case that delivers both financial returns and development \nimpact.  \n \nA.  India \n \n3.  The Economy: Positive Dynamics, Healthy Growth, and Opening Markets. The \nIndian economy is the world\u2019s fourth largest economy, when measured in terms of purchasing \npower parity, after the United States, People\u2019s Republic of China, and Japan, with strong and \ngrowing demand from an expanding middle class. Over the past 10 years, the Government of \nIndia  has  introduced  wide-ranging  changes  aimed  at  accelerating  economic  growth  and \nintegrating the Indian economy with the rest of the world. These reforms have primarily been in \nthe direction of (i) reducing the role of government in industry and trade, and (ii) improving the \ncompetitiveness of Indian industry. In response to liberalization, deregulation, privatization, and \nrelaxation of restrictions on foreign investment and the capital account, gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth accelerated and remained strong until the mid-1990s. Despite a minor economic \ndownturn between 1997 and 2000, sustained growth between 2000 and 2004 revealed that \nIndian companies are adjusting to (i) operating in a liberalized domestic economy; (ii) refining \ntheir strategies for export development and penetration of foreign markets; and (iii) adapting to \nfluctuations in the business cycle, vicissitudes in demand, and exogenous shocks.  \n \n4.  The SME Sector: Poised for Growth, Ready to Capitalize on New Opportunities. \nSMEs have been quick to recognize the opportunities generated by the process of economic \nliberalization. As the absence of linkages between SMEs and larger companies is redressed \nand the latter reach downward into the supply chain to meet growing demand, the SME sector \nhas become poised for rapid growth. Forward-looking SMEs have realized the need to (i) build \n                                                 \n1 Listed in this order throughout the RRP to reflect, largest to smallest, anticipated aggregate investments by the \nFund. \n ", "2   \nskill bases, (ii) achieve cost competitiveness, and (iii) gain market access rapidly to meet this \ndemand.  To  secure  participation in  the  supply  chains  of  larger  domestic  and  international \nplayers, the more dynamic SMEs have begun to (i) strengthen their design and innovation skills, \n(ii) pursue niche production and services models, and (iii) attract world-class personnel. Years \nof underinvestment and SMEs\u2019 realization of the urgent need to scale up in order to compete \ntherefore suggests a period not just of rapid expansion, but also of considerable consolidation. \nFor those SMEs that focus on quality, delivery, and reliability, opportunities abound for strong \ngrowth in domestic and international markets. When they are granted access to both financing \nand strategic acumen, SMEs are poised to flourish in both domestic and export markets.   \n \n5.  SME  Financing:  Highly  Constrained  in  Both  Size  and  Scope  of  Products.  For \ndecades,  India\u2019s  financial  institutions  have  suffered  from  the  same  protectionism  and \noverregulation that constrained growth and efficiency in the rest of the economy. Today, the \nfinancing  culture  in  the  country  is  rooted  in  asset-backed  lending  and  risk  aversion.  After \ndecades of financing the working capital requirements of predominantly large, often state-owned \nenterprises, most banks remain uncomfortable with introducing higher risk products; cash-flow-\nbased lending and risk capital remain unfamiliar territory for Indian banks. The risk aversion of \nfinancial institutions has severely limited financing options for SMEs in India. Lending to SMEs \nfalls largely into the domain of the so-called unorganized sector, populated by informal and \nsemiformal  purveyors  of  short-term  capital  at  punitive  interest  rates.  The  cash-flow-based \nlending that banks do provide is exclusively short term, and used solely for working capital \nrequirements. Although banks provide asset-backed lending, high-growth SMEs often either do \nnot have sufficient assets for this type of financing, or bump up again India\u2019s conservative bank \nlending policies (which typically do not exceed a debt-to-equity ratio of 1:1).  \n \n6.  Private Equity Industry: Much Needed, but Nascent. Given these constraints, private \nequity becomes not only an attractive option for many companies, but also in many cases the \nonly viable option. The private equity industry in India plays a critical role in the economic \ngrowth process by diversifying the sources of finance available for entrepreneurial companies. \nSpecifically, private equity not only provides SMEs with long-term funding, but also allows them \nthe ability to buy fixed assets and use them as collateral for commercial bank loans to leverage \ntheir expansion. Private equity finance thus has the potential to produce greater numbers of \nattractive clients for loans, letters of credit, and other banking services. The assessment of \nIndia\u2019s private sector by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) recommends providing assistance \nto increase the variety of financing instruments that private firms can access.2 The venture \ncapital and private equity industry in India is over 15 years old, and is growing at a healthy pace. \nCurrently more than 35 private equity and venture capital firms are investing in the country with \nover $4 billion invested as of December 2003. However, the market remains relatively small and \nunderdeveloped; the rate of private equity investment as a percentage of GDP in 2003 was \n0.14%, in contrast to 1.0% in the United States and 0.58% in the United Kingdom.3  While many \ninvestors  have  increased  their  allocation  to  private  equity  as  an  alternative  asset  class, \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2004. Private Sector Assessment: India. Manila (p. 48). \n3  Private equity investment rate in percent of GDP in 2003: 1.0% in the United States, 0.59% in Singapore, 0.58% in \nUnited Kingdom, 0.47% in the Republic of Korea, 0.14% in India, 0.12% in the People\u2019s Republic of China, 0.08% \nin the Philippines, 0.03% in Thailand, and 0.03% in Viet Nam. Venture Capital Journal. The 2004 Guide to Venture \nCapital in Asia. Hong Kong, China; World Bank. 2004. World Development Indicators. Washington DC; and ADB. \n2005. Private Sector Operations Department Investment Funds Operations. Informal Board Briefing. Manila (17 \nMarch). (Although precisely comparable data is not yet available for 2004 and 2005, unofficial data from the UTI \nVenture Funds website and other sources indicate that the private equity investment rate in percent of GDP in \n2004 was about 0.19% in India, and is tracking at a similar level thus far for 2005. However, despite these \nincreases the private equity penetration rate in India still lags far behind levels in more developed economies.)   ", "  3\nunderinvestment in private equity continues because of a shortage of fund managers with the \nexperience and financial backing necessary to ensure the sustainability of their operations.  \n \n \nB.  Sri Lanka \n8.  The Economy: Optimism and New Beginnings Following 20 Years of Violence. The \noutbreak of civil war in 1983 led to 20 years of economic underperformance in Sri Lanka. The \ncombination of political instability, violence, and terrorism (i) hampered sustained economic \ngrowth and development, (ii) disrupted the flow of goods and services, (iii) skewed fiscal policy \ntoward  war-related  expenditure,  (iv)  discouraged  foreign  investment,  and  (v) generated  an \nentrenched  short-term  perspective  throughout  a  business  culture  shaped  by  conflict. \nUnsurprisingly, the signing of the ceasefire in 2002 between the Government and Tamil Tigers \nsaw a resurgence in economic growth, with real GDP growing between 4% and 5.9% for the last \n4 years. Confidence in the peace process remains fragile, and squabbling over the distribution \nof emergency relief following the tsunami of December 2004 has augmented tensions between \nthe Government and the rebels. Nevertheless, much of the private sector and the general \npopulation remain cautiously optimistic that a return to hostilities has become increasingly \nunlikely. This has led to a reorientation of businesses to focus on (i) long-term growth, (ii) an \nincrease  in  foreign  direct  investment,  (iii)  increasing  private  sector  investment,  and  (iv) \nincreased development assistance.  \n \n9.  The SME Sector: Poised for Growth, Ready to Capitalize on New Opportunities. \nWith the diminishing of violence and the increasing stability of the operating environment in Sri \nLanka, the SME sector is in a highly favorable position to capitalize on new opportunities in an \noptimistic  environment.  Businesses  are  beginning  to  focus  on  longer  term  growth  and \ninvestment strategies. Additionally, the country is witnessing the establishment of manufacturing \nfacilities by foreign companies that view Sri Lanka as a cheaper and more effective route for \npenetration of the Indian market; and foreign companies are eager to take advantage of the \npreferential  tariff  regime  under  the  Indo-Lanka  Free  Trade  Agreement.  Lastly,  the  sharp \nincrease in development assistance following the tsunami of December 2004 has begun to feed \nthrough to the construction and services sectors, offering up opportunities to well positioned \nSMEs in those industries as well.  \n \n10.  SME Financing: Available, but Insufficient to Meet Financial and Strategic Needs. \nCompared with their Indian counterparts, Sri Lankan banks have actually displayed an unusual \nappetite for lending, including relatively high-risk short-term lending. However, banks are very \nreluctant to provide long-term financing, and equity is almost completely unavailable. Alternative \nsources of capital somewhat analogous to private equity in Sri Lanka include (i) family financing, \n(ii) funds secured from high net worth individuals, (iii) investments made from balance sheets of \nlarge corporations into smaller companies in related industries, and (iv) finances raised by some \nmedium-sized companies from the capital markets. By and large, banks\u2019 eagerness to lend, \ncoupled  with  firms\u2019  general  reluctance  to  allow  external  participation  in  management  has \npropagated a preference for debt financing. Despite the availability of short-term loans, the lack \nof availability of private equity and long-term expansion financing mean that the particular needs \nof SMEs are in large measure not met.  \n \n11.  Private Equity Industry: Much Needed, but Nascent. Volatile political and economic \nconditions, high interest rates, and a tendency to seek financing to meet interim working capital \nrequirements rather than to realize long-term investment strategies have often skewed SMEs\u2019 \nstructural underpinnings and growth strategies. For these reasons, many Sri Lankan SMEs \n ", "4   \nrequire both long-term risk capital and managerial and strategic reorientation to effectively \nexploit  market  opportunities  within  and  beyond  Sri  Lanka,  and  thereby  achieve  sustained \ngrowth. This makes it a promising market for private equity to flourish. However, according to \nthe  Asian  Venture  Capital  Journal  database  (footnote  4),  the  only  private  equity  fund \nmanagement company currently located in Sri Lanka is the local office of Aureos. Indeed, the \npenetration rate of private equity as a percentage of GDP in Sri Lanka is less than 0.1%.  \n \n \nC.  Bangladesh \n13.  The Economy: Improving but Still Highly Challenging for the Private Sector. One of \nthe world\u2019s poorest countries, Bangladesh suffers from (i) a debilitating combination of political \ninstability,  (ii)  poor  governance  and  endemic  corruption,  (iii)  limited  natural  resources,  (iv) \nadverse weather conditions, and (v) a limited manufacturing base. However, improvements in \nmacroeconomic  management  and  monetary  and  fiscal  policymaking  have  enabled  the \nGovernment, multilateral institutions, and funding agencies to widen their focus from improving \neconomic  fundamentals  to  addressing  some  of  the  systemic  and  structural  weaknesses \nimpeding private sector development. Renewed emphasis is being placed on (i) increasing \ncompetitiveness and enhancing management capacity in the banking sector, (ii) reforming loss-\nmaking state-owned enterprises, (iii) combating corruption through the recently established Anti-\nCorruption Commission, and (iv) improving tax administration and expenditure prioritization. If \nand when the private sector will detect concrete improvements in the operating environment is \nan open question. However, there is cautious optimism that the policy framework is moving in \nthe right direction. \n \n14.  In the 1970s, the Government moved away from its socialist orientation and committed \nto reduce its involvement in industry and increase the role of the private sector. However, the \npublic  sector  still  includes  over  40%  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  manufacturing  and  utility  assets. \nPrivatization efforts are hindered by a lack of political commitment, bureaucratic resistance, and \nlabor union opposition.  \n \n15.  The SME Sector: A Challenging Environment. Not surprisingly, the volatile political \nand economic landscape has hampered growth and improvements in productivity and efficiency \nof Bangladeshi companies. The commercial landscape for SMEs is challenging, as they usually \nlack  the  resources  and  political  clout  required  to  navigate  the  labyrinthine  bureaucracy \nregulating license approvals, export permits, or other certifications. Competition among SMEs is \noften vigorous in the domestic context, but few have managed to pursue regional expansion \nstrategies because of the complexities involved and their disadvantageous position vis-\u00e0-vis \nlarger corporations.  Indeed, throughout the 1990s, larger enterprises grew faster than SMEs, \nwhich  generally  use  little  capital  to  produce  simple  goods  for  the  domestic  market.  The \nchallenging operating environment in Bangladesh requires SMEs to be creative in order to \nsurvive and grow. As a result, managerial practices tend to be unorthodox, governance is often \nweak, and strategic planning is either nonexistent or ad hoc. Corruption, irregular accounting \npractices, and tight control of family-owned companies only add to the challenges for SMEs.  \n \n16.  SME Financing: Largely Unavailable. SMEs face huge constraints. The Bangladeshi \nfinancial services sector is small  and undeveloped. Commercial banks are hampered with \nproblems, including nonperforming loans, low loan recovery, failure to meet capital adequacy \nrequirements,  insider  trading,  and  fraudulent  transactions.  State-owned  enterprises  are  the \ntraditional clients of the banks; they receive favorable bank terms, crowding out the resources \navailable for the private sector. This is one of the major reasons for the slow growth of the ", "  5\nprivate sector, and of SMEs in particular. SMEs are therefore generally unable to obtain even \nthe most basic type of bank loan, much less any other type of formal financing.   \n \n17.  Private  Equity  Industry:  Much  Needed,  but  Nascent. In  addition  to  financing  for \ngrowth and assistance in the elaboration of clear, well-planned growth strategies, Bangladeshi \nSMEs urgently require professionalization and modernization. In this context, provision of equity \nto SMEs would be beneficial to individual companies, and would indeed benefit the economy as \na whole. The necessity of injecting fresh capital, in the form of private equity, into the economy \nis  even  more  critical  following  the  tsunami  in  December  2004,  which  redirected  financial \nresources toward disaster relief, and away from small private companies. At this point the \nprivate equity industry in Bangladesh is virtually nonexistent.   \n \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED FUND \n \nA.  Objectives and Description  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n27.  The primary objective of the Fund will be to make equity or equity-related investments in \nSMEs  in  South  Asia  that  demonstrate  strong  potential  for  profitable  growth  and  regional \nexpansion.  The  Fund  will  invest  in  entrepreneurial  companies  in  high-potential  industries \ncapitalizing on strong demand from both domestic and export markets. Additionally, the Fund \nwill seek to promote regional integration of the private sector by supporting expansion of local \nSMEs into regional corporations that benefit from and contribute to economic integration among \ncountries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).   \n \nC.  Fund Management   \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n   \n31.  Fund Manager. The Fund will be managed by Aureos South Asia Managers Ltd. (the \nFund Manager), a company established under the laws of Mauritius. The Fund Manager is a \nwholly owned subsidiary of Aureos Capital Ltd. (Aureos), a global manager of SME private \nequity funds (and also a Mauritius company). The Aureos board in Mauritius is advised by a \ncentral team based in London, Aureos Advisers Limited (AAL), a wholly owned subsidiary of \nAureos. Aureos was born out of what used to be CDC Funds Group, pioneers of private equity \nin many of the emerging markets in the SME sector.  The CDC Funds Groups was established \nin 1990; all of its funds have been exclusively invested in developing countries. When CDC \nspun out its private equity funds business in July 2001, Aureos was established as a fund \nmanager. More than 10 management companies originally owned and managed by CDC, which \nin turn managed 14 SME venture capital country-specific funds, were consolidated under the \nAureos umbrella.  \n \n33.  Headquarters. Aureos is headquartered in London, and focuses solely on operating \nSME funds around the world, thereby combining local presence with a global network. Aureos \nleverages its headquarters for the purposes of centralized reporting, compliance and procedural \ncontrol, knowledge management, training and dissemination of best practices, exit assistance, \ncash control supervision, and cross-fertilization between regional teams. The London team has \n ", "6   \nestablished  operating  systems  and  standards  across  all  Aureos  funds,  providing  general \ncompliance assurance to investors on the nature, method, and manner of investment activity. \nOther central management team responsibilities include the provision of staff training and career \ndevelopment strategies. \n \n35.  Local Office. The local teams in Bangalore, Colombo, and Mumbai carry the main \nresponsibility  for  identifying  potential  investee  companies,  carrying  out  transactions,  and \nmonitoring and managing portfolio companies.  \n \n \nE.  Governance Structure  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION HAS BEEN DELETED] \n \n1.  Fund Manager \n47.  The  Fund  Manager  will  (i)  identify  potential  investment  opportunities;  (ii) screen \ninvestment proposals by making a thorough appraisal of the feasibility and risks; (iii) supervise \nand monitor investments; (iv) dispose of the shares of companies invested at the time of exit; \nand (v) undertake all accounting, compliance, and investor reporting for the Fund. The Fund \nManager will be contractually bound to carry out its responsibilities according to the Fund\u2019s \ninvestment policy. To encourage individual team members to select companies with the most \npromise for entrepreneurial growth, and to enhance the value of their investees, the team \nmembers earn a carried interest, i.e., performance fee, if the return to investors exceeds 6% per \nyear, after the value of their invested capital has been returned.  \n \n \nIV.  INVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Justification \n1.  Development Impact \n59.  By  providing  financing  for  this  transaction,  ADB  intends  to  achieve  the  following \ndevelopment objectives: \n \n(i)  Mobilize long-term capital in the form of private equity for SMEs in South Asia to \nfinance expansion and productivity improvements. \n \n(ii)  Diversify the sources of finance available to SMEs by including equity finance, \nwhich  enables  SMEs  to  buy  fixed  assets  and  to  use  them  as  collateral  for \ncommercial bank loans to leverage their expansion. This dynamic process helps \nSouth Asian SMEs to evolve into larger enterprises.  \n \n(iii)  Demonstrate to the private sector that investments in entrepreneurial SMEs in \nSouth Asia can be commercially attractive, thus catalyzing further investments by \nbuilding  up  local  capacity  to  manage  private  equity  investments.  This \ndemonstration effect will be achieved most effectively by supporting domestic \nprivate equity teams. \n ", "  7\n(iv)  Provide management advice to SMEs in financial planning, business expansion \nstrategies, human resource development, and implementation of international \nstandards of corporate governance.  \n \n(v)  Create sustainable employment in the SME sector in South Asia. \n \n(vi)  Stimulate private sector development to serve as a vehicle for the country\u2019s long-\nterm economic growth and stability. \n \n(vii)  Contribute  to  the  development  of  a  well-functioning  regulatory  and  legal \nenvironment  in  South  Asia  through  the  reporting  by  the  Fund  Manager  on \nregulatory issues that their SME portfolio companies encounter. This information \nwill be reported on a regular basis to the South Asia Department to support the \nformulation of a supportive regulatory framework for expanding SMEs.  \n \n(viii)  Support the development and growth of South Asia\u2019s private equity and portfolio \nmanagement professionals by supporting a first-time fund management team. \n \n(ix)  Promote regional integration of the private sector by supporting the expansion of \nlocal  SMEs  into  regional  corporations  that  benefit  from  and  contribute  to \neconomic integration among member countries of SAARC. \n \n2.  Value Added by ADB \n60.  The involvement of ADB will provide the following valued added: \n \n(i)  Catalytic and demonstration effect. Given the significant risks and challenges \nfacing potential investors, ADB will serve a catalytic role in attracting additional \nlocal  and  foreign  long-term  private  investments  to  India,  Sri  Lanka,  and \nBangladesh.  ADB  will  demonstrate  by  its  intervention  the  credibility  of  SME \nequity finance in the three countries and mobilize capital to support other private \nequity funds. \n \n(ii)  Private  sector  development.  The  Fund,  similar  to  others  in  which  PSOD \ninvests, will make a direct contribution to private sector development. The Fund \nwill  employ  market-based  mechanisms  to  develop  profitable  and  sustainable \nenterprises.  ADB\u2019s  contribution  to  this  type  of  initiative  helps  its  DMCs  to \nimplement  their  respective  country-specific  private  sector  development \nstrategies.  \n \n(iii)  Value added by the Fund Manager. ADB will support domestic teams providing \nhands-on management advice to SMEs in financial planning, business expansion \nstrategies, human resource development, and implementation of international \nstandards of corporate governance.  \n \nB.  Measuring Development Effectiveness \n61.  PSOD  and  the  Operations  Evaluation  Department  are  formulating  guidelines  for \nimplementing  the  Good  Practice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment \n ", "8   \nOperations, which were prepared by the Evaluation Cooperation Group4 of the multilateral \ndevelopment banks.5 These standards cover (i) roles of the independent evaluation department \nand the private sector department itself, (ii) evaluation dimensions for private sector operations, \n(iii) nature of annual reporting, and (iv) dissemination of reports and lessons. According to the \nstandards,  the  three  principal  dimensions  for  private  sector  evaluation  are  development \noutcome, investment profitability for the institution, and operational effectiveness. PSOD will \nmeasure the expected development outcome of the Fund at the Fund and subproject levels, as \nwell as beyond the Fund by monitoring certain performance measures throughout the life of the \nFund. The performance measures are grouped into three key areas:  \n(i)  Business  performance.  The  extent  to  which  the  Fund  has  reached  its \nobjectives in terms of the overall profitability and commercial viability of the Fund \nand subprojects. \n \n(ii)  Economic sustainability. The effects of the Fund and subprojects on the DMC\u2019s \neconomy, and the associated benefits and costs. These measures assess the \nextent to which the Fund improved the allocation of resources and provision of \nfinancial  services  to  viable  private  enterprises,  and  evaluate  whether  the \nsubprojects directly generated positive effects on the local economy.  \n \n(iii)  Private  sector  development.  The  impact  of  the  Fund  on  private  sector \ndevelopment beyond the Fund itself and its immediate stakeholders, e.g., the \nFund\u2019s contribution to the growth of viable financial institutions and financial \nmarkets development. \n \n62.  Quantitative and qualitative measures of performance are summarized in Appendix 1.  \n \nC.  Environmental and Social Safeguard Policies \n63.  The  Fund  is  classified  as  category  FI  (financial  intermediary);  no  significant \nenvironmental impact is anticipated. The Fund\u2019s impact on resettlement and indigenous peoples \nhas been classified as C (no impact). All companies in which the Fund invests will be required to \ncomply  with  national  environmental  laws,  regulations,  and  standards,  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental and social safeguard policies. \n \n64.  The implementation of an environmental management system, which includes ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental and social safeguards, adds value to the Fund. Close coordination with ADB will \nbe  necessary  to  ensure  that  the  Fund  Manager  possesses  the  capacity  to  screen  and \ncategorize prospective investments on the basis of environmental and social impact. The Fund \nwill ensure that at least two of its employees (or one senior officer and one or more environment \nconsultants) receive environmental training approved by the advisory committee. The Fund \nManager will appoint a senior officer to implement and supervise the environmental and social \nmanagement  system,  and  an  environment  coordinator  to  conduct  reviews  of  investee \ncompanies with respect to all applicable ADB policies and all applicable environmental and \nsocial  requirements.  The  Fund  will  develop  an  environmental  management  system  that  is \nsatisfactory to ADB in accordance with the guidelines in Appendix 6. \n                                                 \n4  The  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group  was  formed  by  the  multilateral  development  banks  to  design  common \nevaluation standards for private sector operations. The group\u2019s work is ongoing and some aspects of the present \nevaluation framework might change to correspond to best practices. \n5 Multilateral Development Banks Evaluation Cooperation Group. 2001.

Aureos has extensive in-house environmental management system (EMS) capabilities, \nmanaged through a business principles unit by one of Aureos\u2019 senior staff. Aureos headquarters \nhas  produced  an  extensive  handbook  articulating  the  standards  and  expectations  of  the \norganization with regard to business principles; and environmental, social, and health and safety \nissues. It provides staff with a comprehensive and rigorous road map for evaluating EMS-\nrelated issues at deal origination, screening, due diligence, investment management, and exit \nstages of the transaction. Every new Aureos employee receives training in the EMS standards \nand procedures, and every employee receives yearly training on modifications or new elements \nof the EMS policy at the Aureos annual meeting. Thus, the Fund is well positioned to implement \nwhatever environmental and social safeguards are appropriate.   \n \nD.  Anticorruption, and Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n70.  The  Fund  was  advised  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy6  and  policy  relating  to  the \ncombating of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.7 Consistent with its commitment \nto good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require the Fund Manager to \ninstitute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best \npractice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the \nfinancing of terrorism, and covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The \ninvestment  documentation  between  ADB  and  the  Fund  will  allow  ADB  to  investigate  any \nviolation or potential violation of these undertakings. The Fund Manager already has in place an \nextensive framework for training employees in the prevention of money laundering, and should \nbe well positioned to comply with ADB\u2019s requirements. \n \nE.  Investment Limitations and Waiver \n71.   The proposed investment is within ADB's country and single project exposure limits for \nprivate sector operations, but once made, will exceed the industry exposure limit for capital \nmarkets and investment funds, which is currently set at 15% of the private sector portfolio. \nADB\u2019s current private sector portfolio of capital market and investment funds represents 18.96% \nof  total  exposure  and  following  this  investment  would  increase  to  19.79%.  ADB\u2019s  Risk \nManagement Unit (RMU) and PSOD have been in discussions on reclassifying the industry \nsectors and revising the limits to better reflect ADB\u2019s strategic foci.8 While the capital markets \nand investment funds industry comprises mainly private equity funds, most equity funds invest \nin  turn  in  many  different  industries  and  companies,  hence  ADB\u2019s  true  exposure  is  to  the \nunderlying industries invested in by each fund, not to the generic industry of capital markets and \ninvestment funds. The new industry sectors and limits will reflect this. As a result, RMU has \nconsidered the breach of the industry exposure limit and supports a waiver of this limit by \nManagement for this proposed investment. Management has agreed to grant such waiver.9  \n \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 1998. Anticorruption. Manila. \n7  ADB. 2003.
