THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Hunan Miluo River Disaster Risk Management and \nComprehensive Environment Improvement Project. \n \n2.  The  proposed  project  will  promote  rural  vitalization  and  ecological  protection  by                        \n(i) instituting and applying international best practices for flood and integrated disaster risk \nmanagement, (ii) improving access to safe drinking water and sanitation services for urban and \nrural residents, (iii) promoting circular agricultural development by linking sustainable livestock \nwaste  management  and  eco-farming,  (iv)  piloting  green  procurement  practices  and \nmainstreaming environmental education, and (v) enhancing institutional coordination capacity to \nmaximize the project\u2019s impact. The project\u2019s experiences and practices in addressing climate \nchange and ecological pressures can be replicated in the rest of the Yangtze River Economic Belt \n(YREB), other parts of the PRC, and other developing member countries. The project leverages \ncofinancing from German development cooperation through KfW and counterpart financing from \nthe Pingjiang County Government (PCG).1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Extending  across  nine  provinces  and  two  specially  administered  cities,  the  YREB \naccounts for 40% of the PRC\u2019s population, 40% of its freshwater resources, and about 45% of \nthe country\u2019s economic output. It has been earmarked as one of the three growth engines for the \nPRC\u2019s future economic development. While having benefited from extensive growth since the late \n1980s, the YREB is now facing significant development challenges from (i) increasing pollution \nand pressure on natural resources; (ii) slow transformation to green development; (iii) limited \nintegration of waterways, ports, and intermodal logistics; and (iv) weak institutional coordination \nfor  strategic  planning.  In  response,  the  Government  of  the  PRC  formulated  the  YREB \nDevelopment Plan, 2016\u20132030, which prioritizes ecological protection and the promotion of green \ndevelopment as guiding principles for the YREB\u2019s future growth.2 In this context, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and the government agreed to adopt a framework approach that \nprioritizes  (i)  ecosystem  restoration,  environmental  protection,  and  management  of  water \nresources;  (ii)  inclusive  green  industrial  transformation;  (iii)  construction  of  an  integrated \nmultimodal transport corridor; and (iv) institutional and policy reform. The project is included as \npart of the YREB framework. \n \n4.  The Miluo River is 253 kilometers (km) long and flows east to west from its headwaters in \nnorthwestern Jiangxi Province; 193 km through Pingjiang County, Hunan Province; and into \nDongting Lake. At its confluence with Dongting Lake, the Miluo River forms an important wetland \nprotection area and flood basin in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River system. The river also \nserves as the main source of drinking water for Pingjiang County. \n \n5.  Pingjiang County is located in the northeast of Hunan Province, about 115 km northeast \nof the provincial capital of Changsha City, and covers 4,125 square kilometers. It includes 24 \ntowns, a provincial industrial park, and a national scenic area. In 2019, the total population of \nPingjiang County was 1,119,290, with an urban population of 513,400 reflecting an urbanization \n \n1  KfW is a German state-owned development bank formerly known as KfW Bankengruppe. \n2  Government of the PRC. 2015. Outline of the Yangtze River Economic Belt Development Plan, 2016\u20132030. Beijing. \n ", "2 \nrate of 45.87%. In 2019, Pingjiang County was one of 51 poverty-stricken counties in the PRC \nand one of 20 poverty-stricken counties in Hunan Province. Each year Pingjiang County attracts \nmore  than  15 million  domestic  visitors,  significantly  impacting  the  local  living  environment. \nBetween 2013 and 2018, flooding and extreme weather events impacted 86 villages in Pingjiang \nCounty, damaging about 344 km of riverbanks and 36,150 hectares (542,250 mu) of cropland,3 \nand resulting in an estimated CNY2,007 million in direct economic losses. \n \n6.  Increasing pollution. The ecological environment of the Miluo River in Pingjiang County \nfaces many challenges. About half of all rural villages lack household sewage or wastewater \ntreatment facilities. Farming practices are unsustainable, and farm waste management systems \ninadequate. These, coupled with inadequate management of solid waste, including plastic waste, \nhave a significant negative impact on the rural living environment, increase public health risks, \nand contribute to the declining water quality in the Miluo River. \n \n7.  Weak institutional coordination for integrated water resources and water-related \ndisaster risk management. Like many small river sub-basins in the Yangtze River system, the \nMiluo River is subject to recurrent flooding, which causes extreme damage to the economy and \nenvironment.  Losses  from  floods  occur  because  of  inadequate  environmental  protection \nmeasures against floods, a lack of integrated water resource and disaster risk management, poor \nrural\u2013urban planning, and inadequate coordination with national and provincial programs to \nmanage flood risk. There is a particular need for enhanced institutional coordination among \ncounty bureaus to ensure clarity of roles and functions for integrated water resource management \nand information sharing to plan and respond to water-related disasters more effectively. \n \n8.  Inadequate rural water and sanitation services. An insufficient supply of safe drinking \nwater and inadequate access to basic sanitation services are key constraints on socioeconomic \ndevelopment in rural areas, especially for vulnerable groups (including women, children, the poor, \nand the elderly). Rural households are poorer than their urban neighbors, and a lack of affordable \naccess to a safe water supply and sanitation impacts their health, well-being, and living conditions, \nwhile also negatively impacting the rural environment. In 2019 only 46% of the rural population in \nPingjiang County had access to a tap water supply, and only 3% had access to basic sanitation \nfacilities, such as flushing toilets connected to wastewater treatment facilities.4 \n \n9.  Environmentally  unsustainable  livestock  waste  management  and  agricultural \ndevelopment. Nonpoint source pollution is having an increasingly negative impact on water \nquality in the region. This is because of at least two factors: (i) rapid intensification of agriculture \nover the past 4 decades in Pingjiang County, and (ii) the associated weak collaboration between \nlivestock producers and farmers. Farmers could benefit from using manure waste generated by \nlivestock producers to grow crops to circulate nutrients within agricultural production systems. In \n2018, the agriculture sector discharged about 62.7% of chemical oxygen demand, 52.0% of \nammonia nitrogen, and 39.1% of total phosphorous into surface water bodies; with the livestock \nsector discharging 34.1% of chemical oxygen demand, 47.3% of ammonia nitrogen, and 55.2% \nof total phosphorous. This will increase further in the coming years. If not well controlled, from \n2019 to 2026 it is expected that the chemical oxygen demand discharged into water bodies will \nincrease by 109%, ammonia nitrogen by 108%, and total phosphorous by 110%, with crop \nproduction and livestock both contributing to about half of the increase (footnote 4). \n \n \n3  A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n4  Government of the PRC. 2018. Comprehensive Water Environment Treatment Plan for Dongting Lake. Beijing. ", "3 \n10.  Lack  of  local  community  commitment  to  environmental  protection  and  green \nprocurement practices. While the Hunan Provincial Government and PCG are committed to \nachieve environmentally sustainable economic development, the overall environmental literacy of \nlocal communities remains low, illegal mining  and pollution discharge by small enterprises \ncontinue to occur, and rapid economic development and changes to traditional lifestyles are \naccelerating  environmental  pressures.5 The  significant  potential  for  reducing  environmental \nimpacts through the \u201creuse, reduce, and recycle\u201d initiative remains largely untapped, and green \nprocurement as a powerful tool for meeting environmental policy objectives remains largely \nunused. Public awareness-raising activities have so far overlooked the importance of cultivating \nenvironmental attitudes and values more holistically, thus limiting the level of participation by local \ncommunities in Pingjiang County. \n \n11.  Priorities and targets. The project will support the priorities in the PRC\u2019s National \nStrategic Plan for Rural Vitalization, 2018\u20132022,6 cascaded down in the PCG local context. These \ninclude (i) promoting rural ecological vitalization, pursuing green development, and augmenting \nefforts to deal with significant issues concerning the protection of the rural ecological environment; \n(ii)  pushing  forward  cultural  revitalization  in  rural  areas  and  strengthening  public  cultural \nawareness; (iii) enhancing basic services in rural communities and training professional rural \nservice personnel with a good knowledge of agriculture, rural areas, and rural people\u2019s needs; \nand (iv) reducing gaps between urban and rural residents by developing the rural economy, \nproviding  employment  and  business  opportunities  to  farmers  and  increasing  income  from \nproperty, and helping farmers achieve common prosperity as an immediate target. Access to a \nsafe water supply and sanitation together with good hygiene practices will prevent waterborne \ndiseases and help reduce the risk of epidemics like the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).7 \n \n12.  Strategic fit. The project will demonstrate rural vitalization and ecological protection in \nPingjiang County and contribute to the PRC\u2019s high-quality development goals consistent with the \nThirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020;8 upcoming Fourteenth Five-Year Plan, 2021\u20132025; and \nthe priority areas under the provincial thirteenth five-year plans. It is also aligned with the YREB \nDevelopment Plan, 2016\u20132030 (footnote 2), and the rural vitalization strategy outlined in the \nmemorandum of understanding between the National Development and Reform Commission and \nADB.9 The project builds on ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, particularly operational priority 3;10 ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy (CPS) for the PRC, 2016\u20132020;11 and the forthcoming ADB CPS for \nthe PRC, 2021\u20132025.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n26.  The  project  will  apply  innovative  and  sustainable  technologies,  strengthen  climate \nresilience, and demonstrate the importance of adaptation measures in Pingjiang County. The \nproject was prepared by licensed domestic design institutes, taking into account transaction \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  consultant  recommendations  in  accordance  with  relevant  PRC \nguidelines and regulations. The technical feasibility was confirmed to be adequate after detailed \nexamination of the project\u2019s compatibility with local conditions, including current and projected \nclimate variables, availability of water sources, proximity to residents, and available land for \nproject facilities. Alternative technical options identified the most suitable sites for the facilities, \nand different forms of river embankments and wetlands to suit the local environment. The project \nwill also finance capacity building for implementing agencies\u2019 staff to ensure adequate skills for \nproject implementation and operation and maintenance (O&M). \n ", "9 \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n27.  The economic analysis indicates that the project is economically viable, with an overall \neconomic internal rate of return of 24.3% and a net present value of CNY3,400.09 million. The \nanalysis also confirms the economic viability of all subprojects, with economic internal rates of \nreturn ranging from 19.2% to 28.3%.25 A sensitivity analysis showed that the project is resilient to \nnegative scenarios such as an increase in investment costs, revenue reduction, and increase in \nO&M costs. The eco-framing subproject under Output 3 will generate revenue and is expected to \nrecover all its costs from its revenue. Financial analysis of the project indicated a financial internal \nrate of return of 15.20% for this eco-farming subproject. Its financial internal rate of return exceeds \nthe weighted average cost of capital of 0.54%. The financial net present value was estimated at \nCNY1,066 million. Sensitivity analysis showed that the subproject remains financially viable under \nseveral potential adverse scenarios. The financial analysis confirms the financial viability of the \nrevenue-generating subproject since the financial internal rate of return is greater than the \nweighted average cost of capital, and the financial net present value is positive. The financial \nsustainability of the subprojects was assessed based on the fiscal impact of counterpart funds \nduring the project, O&M costs, and the loan repayment obligation. The analysis confirmed the \nproject\u2019s financial sustainability since it will have substantially limited fiscal consequences for the \nPCG.26 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n28.  Assessments were carried out in the following areas: (i) integrated planning, procurement, \nand financial management; (ii) institutional coordination and capacity development; (iii) water \nquality  management,  integrated  flood  risk  management,  climate  adaptation  and  mitigation \nmainstreaming, and environmental planning and monitoring; (iv) wastewater and drainage system \ndesign, construction, and operation; and (v) sustainable and integrated urban\u2013rural environmental \nmanagement and monitoring. The project will support the PCG in preparing and implementing \ncountywide  capital  investment  as  well  as  strategic  cumulative  environmental  and  social \nassessments to ensure that urban and rural growth plans are sustainable. Since this is the first \nADB and KfW investment project with the PCG, the project management office (PMO) will \ncoordinate all key tasks with the support of the project management consultants. In addition, the \ncapacity-building  activities  were  designed  to  ensure  that  state-of-the-art  information  and \ncommunication  technology  elements  are  harnessed  to  enhance  countywide  institutional \ncoordination.  These  activities  will  provide  adequate  support  for  flood  and  disaster  risk \nmanagement, water quality, and environmental health and safety monitoring. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n29.  The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial, mainly because the \nexecuting and implementing agencies lack experience in executing ADB-financed projects. This \nrisk will be mitigated through the financial management action plan described in the PAM (footnote \n23). The PCG will ensure that (i) additional training on ADB\u2019s disbursement procedures is \nprovided, (ii) unified financial management guidelines are formulated with assistance from the \nproject implementation consultants (PICs), (iii) the PMO recruits qualified finance staff to conduct \nfinancial management, and (iv) the ADB and PICs provide additional assistance and training in \nproject management. Given the mitigating measures, these financial management arrangements \nare deemed adequate. Risk mitigation measures are outlined in the risk assessment and risk \n \n25 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "10 \nmanagement plan.27 A procurement capacity assessment confirmed that the PMO, acting through \na procurement agency and with assistance from ADB and the PICs, will have adequate capacity \nto facilitate project procurement in compliance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n30.  Strategic procurement planning was carried out to identify procurement risks, develop \nmitigating measures, review procurement options, and agree on fit-for-purpose procurement \narrangements. Value for money will be achieved by (i) assigning dedicated in-house PMO staff \nas green procurement focal points; (ii) applying a community participation approach for eco-\nfarming;  (iii)  assigning  early  start-up  consulting  as  nonbank-financed  packages  to  ensure \nmobilization  efficiency; (iv)  advance  contracting  for  ADB-financed  project  management and \ncapacity-building consulting services to ensure proper capacity building and technical guidance \nfrom the early stage of implementation; (v) using the request for quotations modality for standard, \nreadily available goods with low quality risk; and (vi) using a point scoring system for the design, \nbuilding, and equipment supply of the exhibition center contract package, as well as clean \ndelineation of the ADB- and KfW-funded packages to avoid a dual agency procurement review of \nthe same package. \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and PCG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n32.  Poverty and social. The project is classified as general intervention for poverty reduction. \nThe poverty and social analysis was undertaken based on extensive stakeholder consultations \nand social surveys during project preparation. The project\u2019s direct beneficiaries are the 523,333 \nresidents of 239 villages in 25 project towns and subdistricts in Pingjiang County, including \n254,864 women (48.7%), and 112,517 low-income people (21.5%). The project will contribute to \npoverty reduction and social development in the project area by (i) mitigating the potential impact \nof flooding and reducing flood disaster-related losses, (ii) improving access to safe drinking water \nand  sanitation  services,  (iii)  increasing  crop  yields  and  farmers\u2019  agricultural  incomes,                        \n(iv) enhancing residents\u2019 skills, (v) increasing jobs and income-generating opportunities, and                 \n(vi) lowering health risks through an improved environment and sanitation. It is estimated that the \nproject will provide 2,884 skilled and 3,712 non-skilled jobs (including non-skilled part-time jobs) \nfor residents during construction. A social development action plan, including specific actions and \ntargets for the poor and low-income people, has been prepared. \n \n33.  Gender. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming, following ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects.28 A gender analysis conducted \nduring project preparation identified the following areas of action and targets under the project\u2019s \ngender action plan: (i) quotas for the participation of women in emergency response and safety \ntraining on water-related disasters, (ii) leadership training provided to female managers and \ncooperative members to strengthen women\u2019s leadership roles in eco-farming development,                  \n(iii) quotas for women managers on eco-farming demonstration farms and farmer cooperatives, \n(iv) women\u2019s networks established to share information and knowledge on improved sustainable \nfarming practices and environmental management, (v) quotas for women in skilled and unskilled \n \n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 ADB. 2012.

In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.30 \n \n35.  Environment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination,  including  an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) and grievance redress mechanism, has been prepared \nand disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. The initial environmental examination is based on the domestic \nfeasibility studies and environmental assessments, site visits, and stakeholder consultations. The \nPCG, through the PMO, will be responsible for the implementation of and compliance with the \nEMP.  Qualified  full-time  environment  officers  will  be  assigned  to  the  PMO  and  project \nimplementation units, and a training program has been included in the EMP. The project will yield \nenvironmental  benefits,  including  improved  water  quality,  flood  control,  and  solid  waste \nmanagement. Risks include the potential release of contaminants from polluted sediments during \ndredging  works,  short-term  construction  impacts  (e.g.,  dust  and  noise),  and  pollution  from \nlivestock waste or the use of agricultural chemicals during operations. The outbreak and global \nspread of COVID-19 presents a risk to the health of workers and residents. Measures to address \nthese risks have been included in the EMP and include procedures for the treatment and disposal \nof dredge spoil, wastewater, solid waste, and sludge; riverbank rehabilitation; and the preparation \nof a COVID-19 health and safety plan based on best-practice guidelines. \n \n36.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project will involve a total land use of 698.09 \nmu, including state-owned land occupation of 527.85 mu and permanent land acquisition of                  \n170.24 mu. In addition, the project will use 1,219.4 mu temporarily during construction. The project \nwill demolish three old abandoned houses with a total area of 628.53 square meters, owned by \nthree households with 16 persons. The project\u2019s permanent land acquisition will affect a total of \n64 households with 269 persons, and significantly affect 20 households with 83 persons. \n \n37.  The PCG has prepared a resettlement plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement and relevant laws and regulations of the PRC.31 The resettlement plan includes \nadequate compensation and livelihood restoration measures for affected people. Surveys and \nconsultations were undertaken with affected people during the resettlement plan preparation, \ninformation from the resettlement plan disclosed to affected persons, and the resettlement plan \nposted on ADB\u2019s website. Affected people will be further consulted during the updating and \nimplementation of the resettlement plan. A grievance redress mechanism has been established \nand incorporated into the resettlement plan. While the PCG, PMO, and project implementation \nunits  have  the  capacity  to  implement  domestically  funded  projects,  their  capacity  will  be \nstrengthened to implement the resettlement plan and conduct internal monitoring in compliance \nwith ADB requirements. The project will engage an external monitoring agency to monitor the \nresettlement implementation and submit semiannual monitoring reports to ADB. \n \n38.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C).
