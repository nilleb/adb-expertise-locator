During  the  2010  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide Shaanxi \nprovince with technical assistance (TA) to help conduct a study on promoting private investment \nfor social and economic development in Shaanxi. A mission visited the province on 25\u201328 July \n2011 to discuss with provincial government officials and other stakeholders the impact, outcome, \noutputs, and implementation arrangements for the TA.1 The results of the discussion with the \nShaanxi provincial government were reported to the Ministry of Finance on 29 July 2011, and a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  was  signed  on  5  August  2011.  The  design  and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.   The private sector in the PRC grew rapidly during 2006\u20132010, the period of the 11th \nFive-Year Plan. In 2006, the number of registered private enterprises was 8.4 million, increasing \nthereafter at an average rate of 14.3% annually. By the end of 2008, private sector fixed \ninvestment was CNY11.175 trillion ($1.76 trillion), representing 64.9% of the total national figure. \nGiven rapid urbanization and the high economic growth rate in the PRC, it is likely that the \nprivate sector will expand and play an increasingly important role in the country\u2019s economic \ndevelopment. \n \n3.  Shaanxi Province, with a population of 37 million, is in western PRC. The province has \nexperienced rapid economic growth in the last 10 years. Its gross domestic product has grown \nto about CNY1.0 trillion (about $157 billion) in 2010, increasing annually by 14.9% on average \nover  the  period  of  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan.  Its  gross  domestic  product  per  capita  was \napproximately $4,000 in 2010 and was ranked 15th out of 31 provinces.  \n \n4.  During 2006\u20132010, the private sector in Shaanxi contributed significantly to economic \ngrowth. At the end of 2010, investments in fixed assets in Shaanxi were estimated at CNY850 \nbillion ($132 billion), of which more than 45% were private investments. Private sector activities \nhave  gradually  become  an  important  source  of  employment  and  tax  revenue.  However, \ninformation and data collected by the government indicate that a significant portion of private \nsector funds flow through informal financiers and the real estate market, consequently distorting \nsavings and investment flows and causing real estate prices to increase rapidly. The provincial \ngovernment needs to rise to the challenge of encouraging the private sector to invest for higher \nquality and inclusive growth.  \n \n5.  The government of Shaanxi has identified priority areas crucial to the future social and \neconomic development; water resources exploration, transportation and urban infrastructure \nconstruction, land development, and ecosystem and environmental improvement. The Shaanxi \ngovernment has also considered the importance of investment in social sector areas such as \nhealth, education, and social and welfare services. More specifically, the government wants to \npromote  medical  services  development  (construction  of  hospitals,  community  health  care \ncenters,  and  sanatoriums;  public  hospital  restructuring;  and  improvement  of  public  health \nservices  and  designated  medical  insurance  services),  education  and  skills  development \n(strengthening education at various levels from kindergarten education to vocational training), \n                                                \n1  The mission was upgraded to fact finding as the objective, scope, funding and implementation were agreed \nsubsequent to the mission, on 5 August 2011. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's \nwebsite on 7 December 2011. ", "2     \nand social and welfare services improvement (establishment of professional service facilities \nand management of various social welfare institutions such as nursing homes, and rehabilitation \nand care centers for the disabled). \n6.  For many years, development and improvement in these areas has relied mainly on \ngovernment financing and fiscal revenue. However, government finances are limited and cannot \nmeet development needs in the priority areas as well as expansion of services due to population \nincreases and industry development demands. The public has also requested more efficient and \ntherefore less costly services. Under these circumstances, the provincial government intends to \nmobilize private investment and help channel it to these areas.  \n7.  The  central  government  has  issued  several  policy  documents  to  encourage  private \ninvestments in social services, transportation and telecommunications, energy, rural and urban \ninfrastructure, and finance.2 These policies also call for more favorable financial and foreign \nexchange regulations and a supportive tax regime. The government of Shaanxi issued a decree \nto implement the policies. However, the policy documents and implementation decree do not \nprovide sufficient incentive to encourage the private sector to invest in the identified priority \nareas. The Shaanxi government needs to comprehensively review the factors that deter private \nsector fixed  investment  in  the  identified  priority  areas,  and  explore  innovative  schemes  to \nprovide sufficient incentives to the private sector to invest in priority areas. The TA will assist the \nShaanxi government to develop a strategy to mobilize private sector investment, including \ndetailed measures to help implement policy documents and the implementation decree. \n \n8.  The TA is consistent with the National 12th Five-Year Plan and the Shaanxi 12th Five-\nYear  Plan  which  aims  to  assist  the  provincial  government  to  sustainably  increase  private \ninvestment  in  the  priority  areas  of  the  province.  The  TA  is  also  aligned  with  the  country \npartnership strategy (2008\u20132010) which seeks to promote an enabling environment for private \nsector development. Private sector participation will continue to be important in the new country \npartnership strategy (2011\u20132015), which is under preparation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  impact  will  be  increased  private  investments  in  priority  areas  for  social  and \neconomic development in Shaanxi province. The outcome will be new measures issued to \npromote and sustain private investment in the province. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  This policy and advisory TA will help modernize legislation and financial instruments to \nincrease private sector investment in priority areas in Shaanxi. The outputs of the TA will be (i) a \ngeneral  report  on  promoting  private  investment  for  social  and  economic  development  in \nShaanxi, which will be developed based on four thematic narratives; and (ii) a policy note to be \nprepared after the general report is finalized. The four thematic narratives are  \n(i)  innovative financial instruments and facilities for private investment;  \n(ii)   creating  a  healthy  legal  environment  for  private  sector  development  and \ninvestment growth;  \n                                                \n2  For example, the State Council issued Options to Encourage and Guide the Sound Development of Private \nInvestment in 2011. It also announced the New Medical Reform Plan in April 2012 that encourages private \ninvestment in the healthcare industry through new favorable polices for domestic and overseas private investors. ", "  3 \n(iii)   analysis  of  the  Shaanxi  capital  market,  and  guidance  for  its  sustainable \ndevelopment; and \n(iv)   study of industry demand in Shaanxi, and promotion of private investment in \npriority areas. \n \n11.  The general report will provide \n(i)  an appropriate legal framework (revision and/or issuance of laws, opinions, and \nimplementing orders) that will create an environment favorable to private sector \ninvestment; \n(ii)  a list of innovative financial instruments that can be made available to the private \nsector, including incentive packages (e.g. tax breaks, improved access to official \ninvestment channels) to increase their participation in the financial, securities, \nand insurance markets; \n(iii)  recommendations to improve participation of the private sector in local capital \nmarkets, and guidelines for Shaanxi\u2019s capital market development;  \n(iv)  a  list  of  appropriate  industries  suitable  for  private  sector  investment,  and \nproposed mechanisms to promote participation; and \n(v)  an action plan to implement the various recommendations, and feasible ways to \nensure implementation of the plan. \n \n12.  The TA methodology will include data collection and surveys, workshops and report \ndevelopment,  and  a  final  symposium  and  policy  recommendations.  The  consultants  will \ncoordinate data and information flows, conducting surveys and holding meetings with various \nstakeholders. The report will incorporate the source data and analysis to address the issues in \neach of the four thematic narrative areas.   \n \n13.  Study tours3 will also be an integral part of this activity, as the province needs to improve \nits legal and financial environment for private investment by learning from the experiences of \neastern provinces and advanced countries. The international study tour will be conducted in \ncountries  that  have  introduced  policies,  regulations,  and  innovative  programs  that  have \nsuccessfully  created  favorable  environments  for  private  sector  participation  in  public \ninfrastructure construction and social sectors. The executing agency will prepare domestic and \ninternational  study  tour  reports,  and  best  practices that  are  applicable for  Shaanxi  will  be \nincluded in the final report.  \n \n14.  Consultation workshops and meetings designed to extend the development of ideas \nobtained from the first activity will be undertaken. The consulting firm will organize and conduct \nworkshops and a symposium with assistance from the project executing agency. \n \n15.  The first workshop, after one year, will be designed to allow thematic narratives to be \nexamined by different stakeholders and private sector representatives. Emphasis will be given \nto the recommendations that directly address sustainable, effective private sector development \nand investment growth. The workshop will also be a venue for participants to express their \nviews  and  general  ideas  about  the  concepts  being  discussed.  This  first  workshop  is  also \ndesigned to develop an outline for the TA report. \n \n16.  The second workshop will focus on an examination of the draft final general report and \nthe general ideas presented. Stakeholder reactions and general recommendations stemming \n                                                \n3  The domestic study tour will be funded under the TA; the government will finance the international study \ntour. \n ", "4     \nfrom the draft will be documented, and resulting ideas from this workshop will be incorporated \ninto the final report. \n \n17.  The final activity of the TA will be a symposium conducted to present the final general \nreport and a policy note to stakeholders, particularly senior provincial government officials and \nprivate sector investors. The symposium is expected to create an opportunity for participants to \nagree on the courses of action that are integrated in the document, and on next steps for \nimplementation.  \n \nC.
