During  the  Country  Programming  Confirmation  Mission  for  the  Asian  Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) 2007 program for Viet Nam, the Government of Viet Nam requested ADB for \ntechnical assistance (TA) for the preparation of the Second Ring Road (Completing the Circle) \nProject. In the memorandum of understanding for the mission it was agreed that a project \npreparation  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  for  the  Project  would  be  included  in  the  ADB \nnonlending program for 2007. A mission visited Viet Nam on 8\u201317 August 2007 and held initial \ndiscussions with the Government on the proposed TA. Agreements were reached on the impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference.1 A design and monitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The economy of Viet Nam\u2014one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies\u2014grew by \nabout 8.0% in 2006. This performance came on top of average annual growth of 7.5% over \n2001\u20132005. Industry and services contributed more than 90% of the growth in gross domestic \nproduct in 2006. Industry\u2019s robust 10.4% growth in 2006 was only slightly below the rate a year \nearlier. This sustained rapid growth has led to an equally rapid increase in the use of motorized \nvehicles, and to mounting congestion on the highway network. For industry and services to \ncontinue  to  drive  economic  growth,  Viet  Nam  must  keep  developing  its  highway  transport \nsystem so that goods and people can be moved efficiently. \n \n3.  The transport system in Viet Nam is inefficient and expensive. ADB\u2019s strategy, as set out \nin its country strategy and program for the country,2 is to support the Government in improving \ntransport  infrastructure  and  reducing  transport  costs.  Investments  will  be  made  in  urban \ntransport and priority expressway and railway facilities to allow the safe and efficient movement \nof  goods  and  people  around,  through,  and  between  major  centers  of  economic  activity \nnationwide. \n \n4.  Greater Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is the largest city in Viet Nam and the country\u2019s \neconomic hub, with a population forecast to grow by 2.1% yearly from the current 7.9 million3 to \n10.3 million by 2020. The volume of trade through HCMC\u2019s port grew by more than 15% in \nvalue in 2006. With economic growth expected to continue in the medium term, and households \nearning higher incomes, many more families will be able to buy cars, and the number of \njourneys undertaken will significantly increase. Already, the roads within and around HCMC are \nbecoming heavily congested, travel speeds are dropping, and transport costs are rising. There \nis an urgent need to provide relief to the city roads connecting the center of HCMC and the port \narea with the suburbs to the north and northeast of the city, and, farther out, to the roads leading \nnorth from the city to central and northern Viet Nam. As part of development planning for HCMC, \nseveral master plans have been prepared to deal with the needs of specific sectors. The city\u2019s \nneeds are huge. For transport alone, $26 billion is required to fund priority investment projects \nuntil 2020 to enable the city\u2019s transport systems to cope with the demands of growth. To \nimplement the required improvements in transport infrastructure, HCMC must (i) begin priority \nprojects as soon as possible, and (ii) maximize its funding leverage in raising money from all \nsources. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 21 September 2007. \n2  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2007\u20132010): Socialist Republic of Viet Nam. Manila. \n3  Including both the permanent and the transient population. \n ", "2   \n5.  A  transport  master  plan  was  prepared  in  2004,  with  assistance  from  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency.4 This plan was later consolidated with a second master plan \nprepared by the People\u2019s Committee of Ho Chi Minh City (PC-HCMC) and work done by the \nMinistry of Transport\u2019s Technical, Engineering, and Design Institute. This consolidated transport \nmaster plan, approved by the Government in January 2007, sets out a $26 billion investment \nprogram up to 2020. The highest priority is to be given to subway and urban rail projects, as well \nas to the completion by 2010 of the city\u2019s Second Ring Road. \n \n6.  The  Second  Ring  Road  is  one  of  four  concentric  ring  roads  planned  for  HCMC. \nEncircling HCMC at a radius of about 5\u201310 km from the city center, it will decongest the city \ncenter and relieve it of large volumes of heavy truck traffic heading to and from the port area \nsouth of the city center. Much of the Second Ring Road has already been built and is in use, but \na large part of the eastern section and a segment of the western section still have to be \ncompleted. Along the southern section, the Phu My Bridge across the Saigon River is being \nconstructed. The construction of the bridge and the approach roads is being undertaken by a \nprivate sector consortium under a build-operate-transfer concession. \n \n7.  The  Department  of  Transport  and  Urban  Public  Works  (DTPW)  is  responsible  for \nplanning, constructing, operating, and maintaining the transport system in HCMC. Maintaining \nthe city\u2019s road network, in its view, requires about $3.6 million a year. Until recently the DTPW \nreceived only about 50% of the required funds, but the PC-HCMC has committed itself to \nproviding about 75% from the third quarter of 2007. A funding gap remains, however. To bridge \nthis gap the DTPW is trying to reduce operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and has begun \ncontracting  out  maintenance  works  to  the  private  sector.  Contracting  has  so  far  been \nsingle-source, although a pilot project using competitive bidding started in September 2007. The \nDTPW realizes that further cuts in maintenance costs will require more innovative approaches, \nsuch as public-private partnership (PPP) arrangements and long-term O&M concessions.  \n \n8.  The PC-HCMC has established traffic controls in parts of the city with the help of various \ndonors, principally the Government of France and the World Bank. These controls cover only \nsome areas and are not interconnected. Future transport development plans for HCMC will \nprovide  for  traffic  control  systems  that  can  monitor  and  control  the  movement  of  traffic \nthroughout the city. Thus far, however, developments have been piecemeal. There are plans for \nthe following: (i) toll systems within HCMC, e.g., on the Phu My Bridge; (ii) toll and traffic control \nsystems for expressways north and south of the city; (iii) a new traffic control center and \nextensions of existing systems; and (iv) integrated ticketing systems associated with the new \nsubway. To be efficient in managing the HCMC transport system, all of these traffic controls \nmust be interconnected and integrated. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.   The impact of the proposed TA will be a reduction in the cost and travel times for the \nmovement of passengers and goods around the center of HCMC through the completion of the \nSecond Ring Road. Its outcome will be a project design and feasibility study agreed on by the \nGovernment and ADB for the completion of the road.    \n \n                                                 \n4  Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2004. The Study on Urban Transport Master Plan and Feasibility Study in \nHo Chi Minh Metropolitan Area. Ho Chi Minh City. \n ", "  3\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will have the following components: \n \n(i)  Planning for Second Ring Road. This component will address the construction \nwork  required  to  complete  the  Second  Ring  Road  around  HCMC  with \nconnections to all major radial highways. \n(ii)  Management of HCMC urban road network. The PC-HCMC will be assisted in \n(i) reviewing O&M arrangements for the urban road network and considering \nO&M cost reduction measures through PPP; (ii) reviewing existing and planned \ntoll and traffic control systems and finding ways of integrating and extending \nthese  systems  throughout  the  city;  and  (iii)  identifying  an  effective  and \nappropriate  toll  and  traffic  control  system  for  the  Second  Ring  Road  and \nconnecting roads. \n \n11.  The activities in the Second Ring Road planning component will be carried out in two \nstages. In stage 1 the plans for the Second Ring Road will be reviewed and the HCMC transport \nmaster plan will be updated to take recent developments into account and to incorporate the \nlatest traffic data into the traffic model for the city. The work in this stage will be done to confirm \nin principle (i) the advisability of completing the Second Ring Road, given the transport options \navailable; and (ii) the appropriateness of the conceptual designs for the road (available capacity, \nintersection and interchange design, etc.) in view of the traffic demand. The stage 2 activities \nwill involve (i) analyzing the transport network to confirm the economic and technical feasibility \nof constructing the missing sections of the Second Ring Road; (ii) assessing the potential \nenvironmental and social impact of the road construction and preparing the documents required \nby ADB under its safeguard policies; (iii) reviewing the scope for toll collection revenue and \npreparing the preliminary design of the toll facilities; and (iv) reviewing and recommending \noptions for the financial structuring of the Project to ensure that loan debt services can be fully \nmet by the future operator of the Project. \n \n12.  The construction of the missing sections of the Second Ring Road will have significant \nresettlement impact and significant adverse environmental impact. A full resettlement plan and \nan  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  will  therefore  be  required.  Initial  investigations \nsuggest that any impact on the ethnic minorities that may be living within the project area will be \nlimited to involuntary resettlement and can therefore be addressed in the resettlement plan. An \ninitial poverty and social analysis for the investment loan project is in Appendix 2. Detailed \nassessments will be developed during the implementation of the proposed TA. \n \n13.  In the HCMC urban road network management component two studies will be done to \nassist the PC-HCMC in managing the HCMC urban road network. The first study will review \nexisting O&M arrangements for the urban road network and suggest ways of reducing O&M \ncosts, particularly through PPP. The study will identify PPP opportunities, review the legal and \nregulatory framework related to the use of PPP in HCMC and identify constraints, and propose \nappropriate PPP models. The second study will deal with improvements in traffic management. \nIt will review existing and planned toll and traffic control systems and recommend ways of \nintegrating and extending these systems. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.25 million. ADB will finance $1 million. The TA \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of \n ", "4   \nJapan. The Government of Viet Nam will finance the remaining $0.25 million through in-kind \ncontributions of the Executing Agency\u2014remuneration for counterpart staff; office furniture and \nfacilities for the counterpart staff; local transport and local communications for counterpart staff; \nand maps, reports, and other information. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. The \nGovernment of Viet Nam has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the DTPW, and the Implementing Agency will \nbe the Urban Transport Management Department No. 2. The DTPW is responsible for a large \nnumber of major infrastructure projects in HCMC, including the ongoing East\u2013West Highway \nProject  funded  by  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation.  Hence,  the  DTPW  is \nconsidered to have the capacity and capability to undertake the role of Executing Agency for the \nTA. The DTPW deputy director will have overall responsibility for supporting the implementation \nof the TA and for providing guidance, administrative and technical support, counterpart staff, \ndocumentation,  and  other  services  that  may  be  required.  The  Implementing  Agency  will \nestablish a project implementation unit for the TA, headed by a vice director and appropriately \nstaffed for day-to-day coordination.  \n \n16.  The consulting services for the TA will be undertaken by an international consulting firm \nin association with national consultants. The consultants will be hired by ADB according to its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and its quality- and \ncost-based  recruitment  procedures.  Prequalified  international  consulting  firms  must  submit \nsimplified technical proposals, which will be assigned a weight of 90% in the calculation of the \nfirms\u2019  total  scores;  the  financial  proposals  will  be  given  a  weight  of  10%.  This  proposed \nweighting reflects the complexity of the consulting services package. About 147 person-months \nof consulting inputs will be required (international, 21 person-months and national, 126 person-\nmonths). The consulting services will be implemented over 11 months, from 1 May 2008 to 31 \nMarch 2009. An outline of the terms of reference for the services, including the reporting \nrequirements, is in Appendix 4. The consultants will have expertise in (i) the design of highway \nalignments, pavements, bridges, culverts, traffic control and information systems, and road \nsafety systems; (ii) transport economics; (iii) financial analysis and assessment; (iv) structuring \nof PPP for highway O&M; (v) environmental impact assessment; (vi) preparation of resettlement \nplans;  (vii) assessment  of  impact  on  ethnic  minorities;  and  (viii)  assessment  of  gender, \nHIV/AIDS,  trafficking,  and  other  social  issues.  Equipment  financed  under  the  TA  will  be \nprocured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) \nand  will  be  handed  over  to  the  DTPW  at  the  end  of  the  services.  All  surveys  will  be \ncommissioned by the consultants and funded through the consulting services contract.  \n \n17.  The consultants will prepare the following documents and reports, and submit them to \nDTPW, and ADB: (i) an inception report, to be submitted within 4 weeks after the start of the \nservices;  (ii)  brief  monthly  progress  reports  based  on  the  implementation  and  the  staffing \nschedules; (iii) brief interim reports, to be submitted before the end of the third and sixth months \nof the services; (iv) a draft final report (including the EIA and summary EIA reports, resettlement \nplan, and, if required, an ethnic minorities development plan), to be submitted within 9 months of \nthe start of the services; and (v) a final report incorporating the DTPW\u2019s and ADB\u2019s comments \non the draft final report, to be submitted within 11 months of the start of the services. Tripartite \nmeetings will be held after the submission of the inception, interim, and draft final reports. A \nworkshop will be held after the submission of the draft final report to present the results of the \nProject to the Government, nongovernment organizations, and other stakeholders. \n ", "  5\nIV.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy and the sector analysis describe how \nthe project would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction \nstrategy of the partner country. \n \nViet Nam has made impressive gains in poverty reduction over the last decade. The proportion of the population \nbelow the poverty line has declined, from around 59% in 1993 to 25% in 2005. The Five-Year Socio-Economic \nDevelopment  Plan  2006\u20132010  proposes  to  reduce  poor  households  to  15\u201316%  by  2010.  While  significant  in \nmagnitude, however, progress in poverty reduction remains fragile, with a significant number of \u201cnear poor\u201d clustered \njust above the poverty line. Sustained development requires modernized and improved physical infrastructure and \nassociated services.  \n \nThe proposed Second Ring Road is in Ho Chi Minh City, one of the least-poor areas of Viet Nam with a poverty \nincidence of 10.33% (Viet Nam Household Living Standard Survey 2002). In view of the low rate of poverty in the \nproject area, the Project will have limited impact on poverty reduction in the area. However, improved transport \ninfrastructure is critical to sustained rapid economic growth and overall poverty reduction, and can also contribute to \nregionally balanced and equitable economic growth by stimulating industrial development, increasing access to \nemployment opportunities, and facilitating better access to social services. Isolation and disconnection are often seen \nas factors behind the inability of poor people to benefit from economic growth. Road connectivity under the Project will \ncontribute to the ability of poor people to benefit from economic growth in the long run. \n \nB.    Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs  \n  TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \nThe Project will address the construction of a ring road to HCMC and the improvement of urban traffic management. \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1. If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \nNot applicable. \n2. What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? \nNot applicable. \n3. If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \nThe design of the Second Ring Road will include measures to ensure that the construction of the road will not \ndisadvantage local populations within the project area through loss of access. The social analysis will further \nexamine the extent to which the Second Ring Road will help reduce transport costs for the poor and speed up the \nmovement of goods for small producers, petty vendors, and other small businesses. The proposed road is expected \nto facilitate economic growth in the urban area, benefiting the poor and low-income groups. \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA. Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the project? \nThe potential beneficiaries of the project will be the city residents, traders, and travelers both within and outside \nHCMC. Initial observations suggest that lower transport costs and faster movement of goods will benefit small-scale \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \ntraders, producers, and manufacturers by increasing incomes. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \nIncreased transport cost, traffic congestion, and longer traveling times have made business and personal travel \nincreasingly difficult for city dwellers and travelers in and out of the city. There is an urgent need to decongest the city \nroads connecting the center of HCMC and the port area with the suburbs to the north and northeast of the city and, \nfarther out, to the roads leading north from the city to central and northern Viet Nam. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? \nThe PPTA social analysis will examine the present constraints imposed on the poor in gaining access to services in \nthe city (cost of transport, traffic congestion, traveling time, etc.). The impact of the Project in reducing the cost of \ntransport and improving the efficiency of access to services, specifically social services, in the city will be examined. \n \nB. Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders.  \nThe Project stakeholder groups include, among others, government agencies, traders, investors, small traders (men \nand  women),  manufacturers  (men  and  women),  producer  groups  (men  and  women),  and  city  residents.
