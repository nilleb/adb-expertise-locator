Commitments under the Paris Declaration1 require development agencies to align their \nassistance programs with partner countries' national development plans and priorities so as to \nachieve greater aid effectiveness. The commitments also call for supporting the development of \npartner countries\u2019 capacity to plan, implement, and account for results of development policies \nand programs. As a signatory to the Paris Declaration, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nundertaken  a  number  of  initiatives  to  transform  its  relationship  with  developing  member \ncountries (DMC) and reorient the business process to ensure that its assistance strategies and \noperations are aligned with DMCs\u2019 own development plans and poverty reduction strategies. \nThe revised ADB Operations Manual and Guidelines on Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)2, \napproved in February 2007, aim to better align CPSs with DMCs\u2019 own planning processes and \nmake greater use of their diagnostic and analytical work. The revised CPS process recognizes \nthat DMCs may need ADB assistance in strengthening their planning processes and capabilities \nfor  undertaking  underlying  diagnostic  and  analytical  assessments.  To  strengthen  DMCs\u2019 \ncapability for diagnosing and analyzing binding development constraints, a concept paper was \nprepared for a new regional technical assistance (RETA) project, which was approved by the \nVice President (Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development) in February 2007. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The last 25 years has seen considerable developments in thinking on development \npolicies. The Washington Consensus4 was guided by the belief that there is a short list of \nspecific  policy  reforms  that  promote  growth.  The  list  formed  a  natural  reform  agenda  for \ndeveloping countries seeking assistance from multilateral and bilateral funding agencies in the \nlate 1980s. Subsequent experience showed, however, that the expectations raised by this \nagenda were often misplaced. Economic growth fell far short of expectations in Latin America, \nEastern Europe, and Africa, but exceeded expectations in some Asian countries that departed \nfrom the accepted rules of good practices.  \n \n3.  Disappointments  with  the  Washington  Consensus  led  to  the  broadening  of  the \ndevelopment  agenda  in  the  late  1990s,  with  emphasis  shifting  to  the  so-called  second-\ngeneration reforms largely revolving around governance and institutions. There are, however, \nconcerns among many that this approach could lead to an impossibly broad and ambitious \nagenda  that  is  insufficiently  differentiated  according  to  the  needs  of  different  countries. \nMoreover, frequent growth episodes observed in countries with limited or piecemeal changes in \ninstitutional  endowments  and  sharp  disparities  in  regional  developments  within  economies \nsuggest problems with the overemphasis on broad institutional reform as the precursor to \ngrowth, and attracted economists to continue the search for new approaches to development \nstrategy. \n                                                 \n1  Senior officials from about 60 countries and more than 50 multilateral and bilateral development institutions met at \na high-level forum in Paris in March 2005 and endorsed a range of measures in the Paris Declaration on Aid \nEffectiveness (http://www.aidharmonization.org). For a summary and implications for ADB, see ADB. 2005. Paris \nDeclaration on Aid Effectiveness. Manila (IN310-05).  \n2   ADB. 2007. Operations Manual. Section A-2: Country Partnership Strategy. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 22 February 2007. \n4  The concept and name were first presented in 1989\u20131990 by John Williamson, an economist from the Institute for \nInternational Economics, Washington DC. The Washington Consensus contained a set of 10 recommendations \nthat synthesized the policies that the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the United States Treasury \nDepartment, and the Washington-based think tanks considered necessary for the recovery of Latin American \neconomies from the financial crises of the 1980s and cycles of high inflation and low growth. \n ", "2   \n4.  This search led to the Barcelona Consensus of 2004,5 which noted that, while the \nreforms based on the Washington Consensus had led to some encouraging trends with respect \nto  growth  taking  off  in  several  countries  and  increased  recognition  of  the  need  for \nmacroeconomic stability, there were reasons for concern as the reforms had mediocre success \nin fostering sustained economic growth in various regions, in reducing the recurrence and \nseverity of systemic financial crises in developing countries, and in tackling persisting and often \nworsening inequalities in the distribution of wealth and income in developing countries. A key \nrecommendation of the Barcelona Consensus was that, since no single set of policies could \nguarantee  growth,  priority  for  developing  countries  searching  for  an  effective  development \nstrategy should be to identify the most binding constraints to growth and to remove them \nthrough appropriate microeconomic and macroeconomic policies. Prioritizing the constraints \nand targeting the most binding ones promise the highest growth, as their removal would lead to \nthe largest impact. As part of the efforts in searching for new development strategies, several \nHarvard economists have pioneered the Growth Diagnostic Framework, which is a systematic \nmethodology for undertaking country diagnosis and identifying binding constraints to growth.6  \n \n5.  The approach of targeting the most binding constraints is based on a thorough and \nrigorous diagnosis of an economy including prioritizing constraints and identifying the binding \nones. In many DMCs, however, the analytical capabilities of concerned planning agencies are \noften  weak  and  inadequate  for  undertaking  such  diagnosis  and  making  use  of  the  latest \ndiagnostic  techniques.  ADB\u2019s  CPS  preparation  process  by  ensuring  that  pre-CPS  country \ndiagnostics are up-streamed to align with DMC preparation of its development plan, provides an \nideal opportunity for ADB to support the development of DMCs\u2019 analytical capacities. ADB can \nwork closely with DMCs\u2019 planning agencies in identifying the most binding constraints to the \neconomy. However, a review of recently approved country strategy and programs (CSP) by the \nEconomics and Research Department (ERD)7 found that some aspects of the country diagnosis \nin the CSP process were also weak and needed strengthening. \n \n6.  In  light  of  the  Paris  Declaration\u2019s  call  for  supporting  the  development  of  partner \ncountries\u2019 capacity to plan, implement, and account for results of development policies and \nprograms and the findings of ERD\u2019s review, which point to the need for strengthening country \ndiagnosis underlying formulation of DMCs\u2019 national development plans and CPSs, the proposed \nRETA  will  pilot-test  the  Growth  Diagnostic  Framework  in  selected  DMCs  and  explore  its \npotential as an effective analytical tool for undertaking country diagnosis and identifying  binding \ndevelopment constraints. The aim is to work with planning agencies and research institutions in \nselected DMCs to strengthen their analytical capacities. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n5  Sixteen leading economists, Olivier Blanchard, Guillermo Calvo, Daniel Cohen, Stanley Fishcher, Jeffrey Frankel, \nJordi Gali, Ricardo Hausmann, Paul Krugman, Deepak Nayyar, Jose-Antonio Ocampo, Dani Rodrik, Jeffrey Sachs, \nJoseph Stiglitz, Andres Velasco, Jamie Ventura, and John Williamson, gathered in Barcelona in September 2004 \nto discuss effects of economic reforms, lessons for future policy making, and performance of international \neconomic systems, and issued a consensus on  growth and development. \n   http://www.barcelona2004.org/eng/eventos/dialogos/docs/agenda_eng.pdf \n6  See Hausman, R., D.

The  RETA  is  expected  to  enhance  the  development  impacts  of  the  DMCs\u2019  own \ninterventions  and  ADB\u2019s  lending  and  nonlending  operations  in  the  DMCs.  The  envisaged \noutcome is enhanced DMC capacity to undertake development diagnostic studies and formulate \ndevelopment plans or poverty reduction strategies targeting the binding constraints.8 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The RETA will broadly follow the Growth Diagnostic Framework for diagnosing growth \nand identifying binding constraints in selected DMCs. The framework has been pilot-tested by \nthe World Bank in a number of countries to obtain analytical insights for formulating its country \nassistance strategies. The framework is also being tested by the Inter-American Development \nBank for undertaking similar diagnostics in its member countries. Insights obtained and lessons \nlearned by other development agencies and policy researchers from growth diagnostic studies \nwill be closely scrutinized and incorporated.    \n \n9.  Although the Growth Diagnostic Framework was developed mainly to diagnose binding \nconstraints  to  economic  growth,  the  logic  should  be  equally  applicable  to  diagnosing \ndevelopment  issues  other  than  constraints  to  growth,  particularly,  poverty  reduction.  This \nprospect  is  reinforced  by  a  dozen  studies  completed  by  the  World  Bank  in  countries \nrepresenting a broad range of economic performance and history. The RETA recognizes that \nthere may still be a need to refine the framework to better address other important dimensions \nsuch as inclusiveness of growth, and provides for resources and mechanisms to refine and \nbroaden the framework based on experiences gained during implementation. At the start of the \nRETA, experiences from completed studies by other development partners will be carefully \nreviewed. \n \n10.  The  RETA  will  undertake  country-specific  diagnostic  studies  in  four  DMCs.  The \nmethodology will comprise three steps: review of growth performance and patterns, formulation \nof a set of hypotheses and testing of binding constraints, and formulation of policies to address \nthe constraints. The first step involves reviewing a country\u2019s growth performance, analyzing key \ngrowth drivers, and identifying potential constraints to growth following a problem tree analysis \n(Appendix 2). The second step involves formulating a set of hypotheses regarding the binding \nconstraints to growth and poverty reduction, and validating each hypothesis through evidence-\nbased analysis and statistical testing. The third step involves formulating possible remedial \nactions to address the binding constraints.  \n  \n11.  The RETA will be implemented in two stages to provide the flexibility to learn from \nexperiences in the first stage and to refine the methodology of the country diagnostic studies in \nthe  second  stage.  The  first  stage  will  focus  on  developing  the  study  methodology,  and \nconducting  growth  diagnosis  and  identifying  binding  constraints  in  the  Philippines  and \nTajikistan.9 The second stage will involve reviewing and refining the methodology in light of the \n                                                 \n8  A positive externality of the RETA will be ADB\u2019s improved understanding of binding constraints, which should \ncontribute to better formulated rationale for ADB\u2019s interventions in its DMCs. \n9  DMCs to be studied in the first stage, the Philippines and Tajikistan, have been selected in close consultation with \nthe regional departments. Neither country has benefited from a similar diagnosis of binding constraints in the \nrecent past. The CPS processes in the two countries are to start in 2007\u20132008 and findings of the country \ndiagnostic studies will directly benefit them. Governments in both countries have been consulted and have formally \n ", "4   \nexperience gained in the first stage, conducting growth diagnosis in another two DMCs, and \ndisseminating the study findings and methodology. \n \n12.  The main activities in the first stage will include (i) reviewing experience in similar studies \nundertaken by the World Bank and other development agencies and refining the methodology of \ncountry diagnostic studies, if needed; (ii) establishing a peer review group; (iii) establishing a \nwebsite to disseminate the progress and findings and elicit feedback; (iv) conducting growth \ndiagnosis and identifying binding constraints for the Philippines and Tajikistan; (v) formulating \npolicy recommendations for addressing  binding constraints in the Philippines and Tajikistan; (vi) \ndisseminating findings through multistakeholder country workshops; and (vii) preparing country \ndiagnosis reports. \n \n13.  The  main  activities  in  the  second  stage  will  include  (i)  reviewing  and  updating \nmethodology used for country diagnosis in the first stage; (ii) conducting growth diagnosis, \nidentifying binding constraints, and formulating policy recommendations for the two DMCs; (iii) \ndisseminating findings through multistakeholder country workshops, country diagnosis reports, \nand regional workshops; and (iv) preparing a final report summarizing findings, assessment of \nthe methodology, and methodological notes on the conduct of country diagnostics. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the RETA, estimated at $650,000, will be financed by a grant from \nADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  proceeds  will  cover  consulting  services,  country  visits, \nseminars  and  workshops,  data  acquisition,  surveys  and  in-depth  studies,  equipment,  and \nadministration and support costs. The breakdown of the costs is in Appendix 3 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The RETA will be implemented by ADB in consultation with DMC planning agencies and \nin partnership with relevant in-country research institutions. ADB\u2019s Economics and Research \nDepartment (ERD) will administer the RETA in close coordination with the country teams in the \nregional departments. The RETA will be implemented from June 2007 to May 2009. \n \n16.  The  RETA  will  require  an  estimated  47  person-months  of  consulting  services  in \nmacroeconomic and microeconomic analyses (15 person-months international and 32 person-\nmonths national). The consultants will be supported by a number of research assistants, to be \nengaged on an as-needed basis. Given the intermittent nature of assignments and anticipated \nvariety  of  expertise  required,  all  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  as  individuals  in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nOutline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n17.  Procurement  of  equipment  (computer  hardware  and  software)  by  ADB  will  be  in \naccordance  with  its  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nProcurement will take place in coordination with ADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and \nTechnology and Office of Administrative Services. After the RETA, any procured equipment will \nbe disposed off in accordance with project administration instructions no. 5.11.10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \nexpressed their no-objection to the RETA. DMCs for the second stage will also be selected in close consultation \nwith the regional departments and keeping in view the DMCs\u2019 needs.  \n10 ADB. 2007.

The RETA will conduct a number of country workshops in the participating DMCs as well \nas a final regional workshop to disseminate the findings of the country diagnostic studies among \nthe senior DMC government officials, the academe in DMCs, interested civil society groups, and \nADB staff. The RETA will establish a peer review group drawing membership from planning \nagencies, and academic and research communities in the selected DMCs, and development \npractitioners from outside for exchange of ideas and feedback on the methodology and findings. \nThe RETA will also establish a website to elicit an even wider feedback on the findings.  \n \n \nIV.

In leading the country diagnostic studies, the \nspecialists will \n(i)  facilitate  the  formation  and  functioning  of  country  peer  groups  drawing \nmembership  from  national  planning  agencies,  academic  and  research \ninstitutions,  other  development  partners,  and  interested  civil  society \norganizations; \n(ii)  review  the  pattern  of    growth  exhibited  by  the  DMC  and  compare  it  with  \nexperiences in similar regional and nonregional economies; \n(iii)  decompose  economic growth, taking into account factors of production,  and \ndemand and supply side, and compare with  experiences in similar regional and \nnonregional economies,  \n(iv)  construct a growth decision tree identifying the major constraints and hypotheses \nto test the binding nature of the constraints;  \n ", "12  Appendix 4 \n(v)  consolidate into a draft final country growth diagnostic report the findings of the \nconstraint-specific investigations to identify the binding constraints and policy \nreforms to address them; \n(vi)  facilitate the conduct of the country workshop to present the findings of the study \nto the Government planning agencies, the academe, ADB, and civil society; \n(vii)  finalize the country diagnostic report by incorporating comments and feedback \nreceived at the country workshop; and \n(viii)  prepare a presentation summarizing the findings of the country diagnostics report \nfor the regional workshop. \n \nB.  National Consulting Services \n1.  Economists (32 person-months) \n4.  The specialists will undertake 3\u20134 constraint-specific investigations in each of the four \nDMCs, and ascertain whether a particular constraint or group of constraints has a binding \neffect on economic growth and poverty reduction. While the range of priority constraints faced \nby  DMCs  will  vary  from  country  to  country  and  will  only  be  known  after  preliminary \nassessments have been concluded, it is anticipated that the specific studies will cover service \ndelivery,  business  climate,  labor  markets,  trade,  institutions,  geographic  inequities,  and \nadequacy  of  infrastructure.  The  specialists  should  have  a  deep  understanding  of  the \nrespective DMCs economies and broad knowledge in one or more relevant constraints. In \nundertaking the constraint-specific studies, the specialists will \n(i)  formulate at least three distinct hypotheses to test the specific constraints in the \narea/areas of specialization, \n(ii)  assemble the relevant country and cross-country data sets and test whether the \nidentified constraints are binding constraints for the selected DMC, \n(iii)  coordinate regularly with other colleagues on the evolving findings and provide \nfeedback to ensure consistency and complementarity of the final output, \n(iv)  identify relevant policy recommendations for addressing the binding constraints, \n(v)  present findings of the constraint-specific study to the peer group for review and \nfeedback, \n(vi)  summarize  the  findings  of  the  constraint-specific  study  in  a  report  that  will \nconstitute a section or sections of the overall country report, and \n(vii)  present the findings in the country workshop. \n \n2.  Research Assistants (as needed) \n5.  A  number  of  research  assistants  with  background  in  economics  and  with  strong \nanalytical  skills  will  be  engaged  to  support  individual  country  diagnostic  studies  and \npreparations for the in-country and regional workshops. The research assistants will assist in  \n(i)  collecting and analyzing study-related data, \n(ii)  setting up and updating the study website, and \n(iii)  preparing presentations and a handbook for disseminating the  study findings. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20070511140951+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20070502085420+08'00'", "Title": "Strengthening Country Diagnosis and Analysis of Binding Development Constraints in Selected Developing Member Countries", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "Keywords": "growth diagnostic networks, studies formulate policies, methodologies refine research, philippines tajikistan growth investment"}, "author_page": " \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  CSP  \u2013  country strategy and program \n  CPS  \u2013  country partnership strategy \n  DMC  \u2013  developing member country \n  ERD  \u2013  Economics and Research Department \n  RETA  \u2013  regional technical assistance \n       \n       \n \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \n \nTargeting Classification  \u2013  General intervention \nSector  \u2013  Law, economic management and public policy \nSubsector  \u2013  Economic management \nThemes  \u2013  Sustainable economic growth, and capacity development \nSubthemes  \u2013  Promoting macroeconomic stability, and institutional development \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVice President  U.
