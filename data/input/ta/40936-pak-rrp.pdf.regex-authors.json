I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment in JS Private Equity Fund I LLC (the Fund) of up to $20 million or 25% of the \nFund\u2019s total committed capital, whichever is less. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will not \nbe the single largest investor in the Fund. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: BACKGROUND, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Bounded by economic powerhouses the People\u2019s Republic of China and India, the \nimprovement in Pakistan\u2019s economy in recent years may not have been equally captured in the \nmedia.  Pakistan\u2019s  economy,  however,  is  on  the  move.  Growth  is  strong,  companies  and \ncorporate  governance  are  maturing  quickly,  and  entrepreneurial  companies  are  hungry  for \ndiversified sources and types of financing. Key among the financial tools that Pakistan needs to \nhelp its businesses develop quickly and in a sustainable manner is private equity funding, an \nessential  ingredient  for  helping  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  strengthen \ncorporate governance, improve environmental and social standards, develop their business \nmodels to boost exports (thus strengthening the country\u2019s balance of payments), and expand \ntheir operations to create jobs for people in the community (thus helping to reduce poverty). In a \nfrontier economy such as Pakistan, these challenges are all the more pronounced, and private \nequity financing plays an even more profound development role. \n \nA.  Challenges and Opportunities \n3.  Strong Macroeconomic Performance. Pakistan\u2019s recent macroeconomic performance \nhas  been  very  strong,  driven  by  an  improved  foreign  exchange  position,  prepayments  of \nexpensive debt, and an economic agenda focused on governance reforms, privatization, and \nderegulation. Gross domestic product grew 8.35% in fiscal year (FY) 2005; the estimate for \nFY2006  is  6.5%,  outstripping  regional  averages.  The  economy  is  anticipated  to  continue \ndelivering strong growth in 2007. Per capita income in nominal terms has been growing at an \naverage annual rate of 13.5% for the past 3 years. Foreign direct investment increased from \n$949 million in FY2004 to $1.7 billion in FY2005, and surged to $2.22 billion during the first 9 \nmonths of FY2006.1 In February 2004, Pakistan returned to the international capital markets \nafter a gap of more than 5 years, with a $500 million 5-year Eurobond that was oversubscribed \nby four times. Both Moody\u2019s and Standard & Poor\u2019s have upgraded their credit ratings of the \ncountry in the last 18 months by one notch, to B2 from Moody\u2019s, and B+ for foreign currency \nand BB for local currency from Standard & Poor\u2019s. According to the Asian Development Outlook \n2006, this strong growth is anticipated to continue over the medium term.2  \n \n4.  Financial Sector Reform. Benefiting from ongoing reforms, the financial sector has not \nonly recorded visible changes in its size (growing larger) and ownership structure (increasingly \ndominated by the private sector in response to the Government\u2019s privatization policies), but also \nin its key performance indicators. Performance indicators reflect the sector\u2019s resilience to both \ninternal and external shocks (as evidenced by its increased risk absorption capacity, measured \nby higher equity-to-liability ratios), and its increasing efficiency (evidenced by narrowing spreads \nand net interest margins). Additionally, the State Bank of Pakistan and the Securities and \n                                                 \n1  Wikipedia. 2006. Economy of Pakistan. Available: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Pakistan. \n2  Unless otherwise footnoted, data in this paragraph are from ADB. 2006. Asian Development Outlook 2006. Manila. \nAvailable: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/ADO/2006/pak.asp.  ", "2   \nExchange Commission have put great effort into bolstering the country\u2019s financial infrastructure. \nThe  State  Bank  has  undertaken  a  comprehensive  revision  of  the  prudential  regulations \nframework, and issued separate sets of regulations for different participants in the financial \nsector (i.e., commercial lending, SMEs, consumer financing). The State Bank has also issued \nregulations for the financial derivatives business and started the process of implementing Basel \nII.  Supporting  these  financial  sector  reforms,  the  legal  framework  has  been  updated  to \nstrengthen  the  mechanisms  for  recovery  of  outstanding  dues  by  financial  institutions.  The \neconomy  has  demonstrated  strong  recent  growth  in  financial  savings,  bolstered  by  robust \ninflows  of  remittances.  The  interest  rate  scheme,  which  previously  suffered  from  severe \ndistortions, has become substantially less distorted over the last several years due to measures \ntaken by the Government. Banking spreads have declined significantly over the last several \nyears,  as  competition  among  banks  has  increased.  Thus,  Pakistan\u2019s  financial  sector  has \nundergone significant reforms and has improved substantially over the last several years.3   \n \n5.  Strengthened Corporations and Corporate Governance. This macroeconomic revival \nand increasing health of the financial sector is translating into improving corporate fundamentals \nand governance. Pakistan\u2019s corporate sector has repeatedly posted improved earnings results \nover the last several years, as reflected in a stock market that has outperformed all other Asian \nmarkets.  An  important  factor  behind  the  improved  corporate  performance  has  been  the \nemergence of a new generation of Pakistani business leaders, often having been educated \nabroad and with experience in international companies; they are implementing world-class \nmanagement  practices,  governance  standards,  and  increased  transparency.  These \nimprovements are translating into sustained improvements in corporate earnings and valuations \nattached to those companies. In its October 2005 Journey to Pakistan research report, CLSA \nAsia-Pacific Markets was \u201cpositively surprised by the high levels of corporate transparency. \nListed  companies  publish  quarterly  balance  sheets  and  income  statements,  disseminate  a \nconsiderable amount of information through their websites, and follow international accounting \nstandards.\u201d  \n \n6.  Expanding  Financing  Options\u2014Availability  of  Debt.  Stronger,  better  managed \ncorporations are increasingly able to source expansion capital in the form of debt. Historically, \nraising debt funding at the corporate level in Pakistan was relatively complicated; the banking \ninstitutions were primarily public sector owned and, through a combination of inefficiency and \nlack  of  incentives,  were  not  active  providers  of  debt  finance.  The  debt  capital  markets  in \nPakistan were also relatively small, with the first corporate bond issue only taking place in 1995. \nHowever, with deregulation and liberalization of banking over the last 5 years, a greater range of \nprivate  sector  banking  institutions  is  aggressively  pursuing  the  corporate  lending  market, \nallowing corporations access to debt financing for the first time.  \n \n7.  Serious Financing Gaps. Despite all of this positive news for the Pakistan business \nsector, growing companies need equity as well as debt, and the private equity industry is almost \nnonexistent. While corporate foreign direct investment in Pakistan has yielded healthy returns to \ninternational investors in the past 4 or 5 years, Pakistan has been largely ignored by emerging \nmarket private equity fund managers. Additionally, Pakistani financial institutions investing in \nprivate equity face regulatory and legal constraints: (i) investment banks require Securities and \nExchange Commission of Pakistan approval on a deal-by-deal basis for any investment into \nunlisted equity, which is complicated and time-consuming; (ii) mutual funds are prohibited from \ninvesting in unlisted equity; and (iii) commercial banks may only invest up to a total of 30% of \n                                                 \n3  State Bank of Pakistan Research Department. 2006. Pakistan Financial Sector Assessment 2004. Available: \nhttp://www.sbp.org.pk/publications/FSA-2004/index.htm. ", "    3\ntheir own equity in either listed or unlisted securities. These restrictions mean that private equity \ninvesting has effectively been left to high net worth individuals (either directly or through their \nbusiness  groups),  securities  firms,  and  some  nonresident  Pakistanis.  Although  several \ndedicated private equity funds are expected to close soon (one launched by Abraaj Capital and \nBMA Capital, another by Small Enterprise Assistance Funds and TMT Ventures, as well as \nseveral others such as Habib Group, Actis, and a few hybrid funds), these funds are very new \nand relatively small. Indeed, the Asian Venture Capital Journal does not list any dedicated funds \ncurrently operating in Pakistan, creating a huge constraint for companies seeking this form of \nfinancing. The absence of professional private equity funding has, in the past, forced growth \ncompanies to seek capital from the public markets at a relatively early stage.  \n \n8.  Opportunities  for  Private  Equity.  While  underdevelopment  of  the  private  equity \nindustry is a major constraint for the economy, it creates a formidable opportunity for the Fund. \nCompetition for the Fund is limited from either local or international institutions as the private \nequity industry is truly in its initial stages of development. The Fund Manager possesses the \nrequisite private equity skills and experience, and will offer an attractive alternative to growth \ncompanies rather than premature initial public offerings (IPOs), allowing them a \u201cbreathing \nspace\u201d to build greater value before accessing public markets. \n \nB.  Development Impact \n1.  Development Objectives \n9.  Portfolio Companies. By investing in the Fund, ADB intends to achieve the following \ndevelopment objectives for portfolio companies: \n \n(i)  Create  jobs  and  support  growth  of  companies.  The  Fund  will  invest  in \nportfolio  companies,  which  will  use  the  invested  money  for  growth  and \nexpansion,  thus  developing  individual  companies  in  the  private  sector,  and \ncreating  jobs  and  sustainable  employment  in  the  community.  In  growing \ncompanies,  jobs  are  needed  at  all  skill  levels,  thus  generating  employment \nacross  the  socioeconomic  spectrum,  including  for  the  lower  income  tiers, \nparticularly critical in a frontier economy such as Pakistan. These companies\u2019 \ngrowth frequently results in entrance or deeper penetration into export markets, \nthus contributing positively to the country\u2019s balance of payments position. \n \n(ii)  Build higher quality companies that raise overall industry standards. The \nFund will provide management advice to entrepreneurial companies on financial \nplanning,  business  expansion  strategies,  human  resource  development, \ntechnology, environmental and social issues, and implementation of international \nbest practices of corporate governance, thus raising the quality of individual \ncompanies.  These  international  best  practices  encompass  not  only  business \nmodels, but also standards for corporate governance and environmental and \nsocial  compliance,  thus  creating  not  only  more  profitable,  but  also  more \nsustainable, businesses. As companies in the industry are forced to compete on \nall of these fronts for market share and financing, the degree of sophistication \nand efficiency of the whole industry will increase. \n \n(iii)  Provide knowledge transfer and management skills training. The Fund will \nprovide advice to the management teams of portfolio companies. In addition to \ncontributing to stronger, more sustainable companies, this management advice \n ", "4   \nwill  serve  to  develop  a  cadre  of  local  business  professionals  with  needed \nmanagerial skills. These local professionals will either stay with the company, or \nleave to join other firms, thus supplying the industry with skilled managers.  \n \n(iv)  Support financial diversification. The Fund\u2019s equity investments into portfolio \ncompanies will diversify the sources of finance available to them. Companies that \nhave access to equity financing are then able to (a) obtain bank loans based on \ntheir  debt-to-equity  ratios,  and  (b)  buy  fixed  assets  to  use  as  collateral  for \nsecured  loans.  This  dynamic  process  of  leveraging  their  expansion  helps \nmedium-sized companies graduate to larger enterprises and eventually raise \ncapital by listing on the stock exchange.  \n \n(v)  Contribute  indirect  effects  and  externalities.  In  addition  to  the  direct \ncontributions to economic development, the Fund will make several indirect, but \nimportant, contributions: (a) the Fund\u2019s investments will be used for the growth \nand improvement of portfolio companies, which will result in increased taxable \nrevenues that the Government can direct to social services and infrastructure \nrequirements;  (b)  the  Fund  will  invest  in  innovative  companies  that  provide \ndemand-driven  products  and  services,  the  availability  of  which  improves  the \nstandard of living for people in the community; (c) the Fund\u2019s portfolio companies \nwill  often  use  inputs  to  production,  sourced  from  local  companies,  creating \nupstream linkages and benefits for the producers of the inputs; and (d) the \nprivate sector jobs created at portfolio companies will contribute to an employed \nmiddle class, which serves as a vehicle for the country\u2019s long-term economic \nprogress and overall stability, and which indirectly supports poverty reduction.   \n \n10.   Private Equity Industry. An investment in the Fund will develop the private equity \nindustry, in four specific ways:  \n \n(i)  Asset class. ADB\u2019s investment will help demonstrate the credibility and potential \nof  private  equity  in  Pakistan.  The  private  equity  industry  is  severely \nunderdeveloped  as  compared  with  those  of  more  economically  developed \ncountries that actively utilize private equity to foster local management capacity \nand  demonstrate  a  return  on  investment  in  entrepreneurial  SMEs.4  ADB\u2019s \ninvestment in the Fund will help to develop the asset class and, by demonstrating \nthe  potential  of  private  equity,  will  attract  more  firms  to  enter  the  market, \ndeepening the penetration and growth of the asset class.  \n \n(ii)  The market. The Fund\u2019s interaction with companies in the market will help to \neducate the management teams of existing and potential portfolio companies \nwith regard to the private equity asset class and its advantages as a financing \ntool. This will increase demand for the product, and increase the amount and \nquality of deal flow for private equity firms operating in the market.  \n \n                                                 \n4  The following research papers provide insights into this subject: (i) Doran, A. and Graham Bannock. 2000.

", "    5\n(iii)  The Fund. The Fund will help to develop a class of fund managers and financial \nprofessionals  in  Pakistan.  The  majority  of  the  Fund\u2019s  management  team  is \ncomprised of native Pakistanis. ADB\u2019s support of a truly local team helps ensure \nthe growth and perpetuation of the private equity industry in Pakistan, which \ncontributes to the development of the financial sector more broadly.  \n \n(iv)  Portfolio companies. ADB\u2019s investment will mobilize long-term risk capital for \nthe  Fund\u2019s  portfolio  companies  from  private  sources  for  entrepreneurial \ncompanies to finance expansion and improvement.  \n \n11.  Information Collection. The Fund will be required to collect consistent information on \nregulatory issues and challenges encountered by their portfolio companies. This information will \nbe reported on a regular basis to ADB, to allow for better understanding of the key regulatory \nand legal constraints faced by entrepreneurial companies in the region. ADB is expected to use \nthis  understanding  of  the  regulatory  environment  to  have  productive  discussions  with \ngovernments in the region, to help them address key constraints, and to encourage them to \nsupport regulatory frameworks conducive to entrepreneurship and SME development. Thus, in \naddition to its direct impact on employment and economic growth, the Fund will in this manner \ncontribute  to  the  development  of  an  effective  and  well-functioning  regulatory  and  legal \nenvironment in Pakistan. \n  \n2.  Value Added by ADB \n12.  Catalytic and Demonstration Effect. Given the significant risks and challenges facing \npotential investors as well as the emergent nature of the Pakistan private equity industry, ADB \nwill serve a catalytic role in helping to attract additional local and foreign private equity regionally. \nADB will demonstrate by its intervention the credibility of private equity in its developing member \ncountries (DMCs) and mobilize capital to support other private equity funds. \n \n13.  Private Sector Development. The Fund, similar to others in which ADB invests, will \nmake a direct contribution to private sector development. The Fund will employ market-based \nmechanisms to develop profitable and sustainable enterprises. ADB\u2019s contribution to this type of \ninitiative helps its DMCs implement their country-specific private sector development strategies, \nand through its focus on governance and environmental and social safeguards, helps its DMCs \nto implement these strategies in a responsible, sustainable fashion. \n \n14.  First-Time Fund Manager and Work in Frontier Area. Through this investment, ADB \nwill be adding particular value by supporting a first-time fund manager in a country in which the \nlack of fund management teams is a serious constraint to the development of the private equity \nindustry. Additionally, ADB will be supporting a transaction in one of its frontier DMCs, in which \nthe  challenges  of  attracting  investment  are  among  the  most  profound.  This  transaction, \nimportant in its own right, will increase knowledge of investments in frontier areas within ADB\u2019s \nCapital Markets and Financial Sectors Division, a key focus for the group.  \n \n3.  Development Outcome \n15.  ADB will measure development outcomes of the Fund and subprojects, as well as \nbeyond the Fund by monitoring certain performance measures for the duration of the Fund. \nPerformance measures beyond the Fund will be monitored for indicative purposes, although the \nFund on its own may be considered only a contributing factor among many other driving forces.  \n \n ", "6   \n(i)  Fund  and  subproject  measures.  Performance  measures  to  be  considered \nduring  monitoring  include  (a)  annual  employment  growth  by  subproject,  (b) \nannual net profits of the subprojects, (c) value addition in terms of corporate \ngovernance  improvement  measures  undertaken  at  the  subproject  level,  (d) \nefforts to influence positive regulatory changes at the Fund and subproject levels, \n(e) ongoing access to debt and equity (including growth in retained earnings) \nfinancing  for  expansion  purposes,  and  (f)  annual  taxes  paid.  Specific \nperformance measures may be adapted for individual subprojects as relevant \nand useful for determining overall development effectiveness of the Fund. \n \n(ii)  Macro measures. Performance measures employed and monitored beyond the \nFund will include (a) growth in private equity in the Fund\u2019s target area, and (b) \nimprovement in the region\u2019s overall employment rates by SMEs.  \n \n16.  Quantitative and qualitative measures of performance are detailed in Appendix 1.  \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT \n17.  The Fund Manager\u2019s investment objective for the Fund is to achieve long-term capital \nappreciation by investing in companies with high potential that are operating in Pakistan. The \nFund  will  make  equity,  quasi-equity,  and  debt  investments  using  a  variety  of  instruments, \nincluding ordinary or preferred shares, warrants, options, convertible debt, and debt in various \nforms. The Fund will invest in companies that derive a substantial portion of their revenues or \nprofits from Pakistan in order to capture the value created during the current upward economic \ntrend and deliver attractive returns to the Fund\u2019s investors.  \n \n18.  The Fund will enter into a management agreement with JSPE Management LLC (the \nFund Manager), which will employ the management team, based in Pakistan and Dubai. The \nFund will have an investment committee that recommends investments to the Fund Manager.  \n \n19.  One of the most important aspects of the Fund\u2019s competitive advantage derives from the \npast and ongoing relationships that the individuals of the fund management team have with \nJS&Co.  JS&Co  is  one  of  the  largest  and  best  regarded  financial  services  groups,  and  a \ndiversified investor in Pakistan.  \n   \n \nIV.   INVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Social and Environmental Safeguard Policies \n20.  The Fund will not invest in excluded activities, such as weapons, tobacco, gambling, \npornography, activities involving forced labor or child labor, or in any other industry falling within \nADB\u2019s list of exclusions. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s investment in the Fund is classified as category FI (financial intermediary) under \nADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002).  The  Fund  Manager  will  be  required  to  adopt  an \nenvironmental management system. ", "    7\n \n22.  ADB\u2019s  investment  in  the  Fund  is  classified  as  category  C  under  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995); no involuntary settlements are foreseen in relation to any \ninvestments by the Fund. The Fund will adopt a resettlement framework that defines the policies, \nprocedures, roles, and responsibilities of the Fund for screening and managing involuntary \nresettlement by portfolio companies, if any. \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s  investment  in  the  Fund  is  classified  as  category  C  under  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998) and no investments by the Fund are expected to have an impact on \nindigenous peoples.  \n \nB.  Anticorruption, and Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism \n24.  The Fund Manager was advised of ADB\u2019s policy paper Anticorruption (1998)5 and policy \nrelating to the combating of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.6 Consistent with \nits commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require the \nFund Manager to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The investment documentation between ADB and the Fund will \nallow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings.  \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n25.  Following the approval of the proposed investment by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, ADB \nwill enter into suitable investment documentation, and ensure that such documentation and \nother principal agreements relating to the Fund (including the Management Agreement between \nthe Fund and the Fund Manager) will be on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB and \nincorporate all relevant ADB policies. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n26.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  investment  in  JS  Private  Equity  Fund    I  LLC  as \ndescribed in this report complies with the Articles of Agreement of ADB and acting in the \nabsence of the President, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of \nADB, I recommend that the Board approve the investment in JS Private Equity Fund I LLC of up \nto the lesser of $20,000,000 or 25% of the Fund\u2019s total committed capital from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources. \n \n \n \nLiqun Jin \nVice President \n \n \n22 June 2007 \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1998.
