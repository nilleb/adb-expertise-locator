The loans will be \naccompanied by a technical assistance grant in the amount of $2 million.   \n   \nClassification  Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention TI-H (income-poverty) \nSector: Finance \nSub-sectors: Finance sector development  \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth; capacity development \nSubthemes:  Promoting  economic  efficiency  and  enabling  markets; \ninstitutional development \n   \nEnvironment  Category C:  Environmental assessment of policy interventions indicate \nAssessment  that the program is unlikely to have adverse environmental impacts \n   \nSocial Safeguard  Involuntary resettlement: Category C \nAssessment  Impact on indigenous people: Category C \nNo involuntary resettlement or impact on indigenous people is expected \nfrom implementation of the program. \n   \nRationale  Pakistan has achieved economic growth rates averaging over 7.5% a year \nfor the past 3 years. Reforms have led to a better and more predictable \nenvironment for public and private investment and thus to job creation and \nhigher incomes. This growth has cut poverty and increased prosperity. \nHowever, 24% of the population, or 36 million people, still live below the \npoverty line. Inclusiveness and/or the sustainability of this growth require \nmore reforms backed by specific actions targeting those left behind.  Many \nof these communities live in rural areas, although urban poverty is not a \nless  serious  matter.  Measures  focusing  on  inclusiveness  do  not  only \nsupport  equity,  they  are  also  good  business,  as  evidenced  by  the \nmainstreaming  of  microfinance  in  the  financial  sector.  Bringing  poor \ncommunities  into  the  formal  economy  (either  as  self  employed \nentrepreneurs or through micro-, small, and medium-sized enterprises) \nalso contributes to investment, job creation and welfare. A wide range of \nmeasures can be used to achieve this. Access to credit and other financial \nservices can be made much easier, more transparent, cost effective, and \nefficient. This is the essence of the proposed program.   \n \nMicrofinance currently reaches fewer than 1 million people in Pakistan, but \nthe market is many times this size and current market estimates range \nover 20 million people. The Government has made microfinance a key \ntheme under its Medium-Term Development Framework (MTDF) 2005\u2013\n2010  and  the  broader  Strategic  Directions  to  Achieve  Vision  2030. \nBuilding a more inclusive financial sector means deepening the quality of \nthe service and expanding the coverage, while at the same time striving \nfor efficiency and sustainability. The sector has improved, but still does not \ntouch vast numbers of people. The proposed reform program is meant to \nchange this.  It will do so by developing an enabling legal and regulatory \n ", "ii \nenvironment and introducing specific actions to remove bottlenecks and \nconstraints at two strategic levels (i) the formal and informal intermediary \nnetworks, and (ii) clients and potential clients. The action plans will focus \non key success factors.  These include the promotion of technology and \napplications to achieve national scale at reduced cost for all types of \nfinancial service providers; expanding the range and quality of financial \nproducts and services including those for the Islamic market; developing \npublic\u2013private  partnerships  to  expand  outreach;  stepping  up  reliable \nbusiness and credit information and systems; expanding fast, reliable and \nlower-cost remittance services for overseas workers; capacity building for \ninstitutions and authorities; and  support for literacy to improve access to \nfinance and its utilization for sustained economic growth.  \n   \nImpact and  Improving access to financial services will improve opportunities for rural \nOutcome  and  urban  communities  and  ultimately  reduce  poverty.  The  proposed \nIAFSP will increase access to better (and more tailored) financial services \nby the self-employed, as well as by micro and small sized companies. The \nprogram targets poor and low-income households but also individuals, \nincluding  women.  It  will  spearhead  outreach  and  product  and  service \ninnovation, and utilize new technologies and applications to reduce the \ntransaction costs associated with the delivery of financial services. Public-\nprivate partnerships and private sector participation will be promoted for a \nmore robust and competitive market. \n   \nLoan Amounts  The proposed loans are as follows: \nand Terms   \n(i) A $300 million loan from the ordinary capital resources (OCR) of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) with an interest rate to be determined in \naccordance  with  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility, a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years, and \nother terms and conditions as set forth in the loan agreement. \n \n(ii) A loan of Special Drawing Rights 13,425,000 ($20 million equivalent) \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, a term of \n24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and  other  terms  and \nconditions as set forth in the loan agreement.  \n   \nProgram Period  The expected program completion date is 24 months from effectiveness, \nand Tranching  and  the  program  loan  closing  is  expected  3  months  after  program \ncompletion. The loan will be released in two tranches. The first tranche of \n$120  million  will  be  made  available  when  the  Government  meets  the \nconditions  of  loan  effectiveness  and  complies  with  the  first  tranche \nconditions. The first tranche will comprise $100 million from OCR and $20 \nmillion  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources.  The  second \ntranche of $200 million from OCR is expected to be released within 24 \nmonths  of  loan  effectiveness,  and  will  be  released  upon  satisfactory \ncompliance with agreed-upon conditions. \n   \n \n \n ", "iii \nExecuting  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency. \nAgency and  Implementing  Agencies  will  be  State  Bank  of  Pakistan  (SBP);  Central \nImplementation  Bureau of Revenue (CBR); Ministry of Information Technology (MOIT); \nArrangements  Pakistan  Post;  and  the  Board  of  Revenue  of  Sindh  Government.  A \nprogram coordination and implementation unit (PCIU) will be established \nin  Islamabad  at  the  MOF  for  program  coordination,  monitoring,  and \nmanagement across agencies. Working groups will also be established to \ninclude  all  Implementing  Agencies  for  a  good  collaboration, \ncommunication  and  timely  implementation  of  measures  under  the \nprogram.  In  addition  to  the  PCIU,  SBP will provide  office  facilities  for \nconsultants  in  Karachi  to  facilitate  coordination  and  the  oversight  of \nconsultants. The PCIU will be responsible to provide the required program \nreports and information for implementation of the program.     \n   \nProcurement  and  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the costs (excluding local duties \nDisbursement  and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nexcluding  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  sources.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for \nProgram Loans, a reimbursement procedure will be used to disburse the \nloan proceeds based upon certification to be provided by the Borrower. No \nsupporting import documentation will be required, if, during each year that \nloan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of the Islamic \nRepublic  of  Pakistan\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed  under  other  official \ndevelopment assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan \nexpected to be disbursed during the year. The Government will certify its \ncompliance with this formula with each withdrawal request. Otherwise, \nimport documentation under existing procedures will be required. ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n   \nCounterpart  Counterpart funds will be used for the financial and institutional costs \nFunds  associated with implementing the reform program and other development \nfinancing needs. The entire counterpart funds of the $20 million equivalent \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources loan shall be transferred as a capital \ncontribution  to  the  Improving  Access  to  Financial  Services  Fund,  an \nendowment fund to be established to support (i) capacity building and \ntraining of financial services providers to promote  expansion into rural \nareas; product and service innovation, including savings, remittances and \nIslamic financial services; adoption and integration of new technologies \nand applications for improving access to financial services; (ii) capacity \nbuilding and training of Government and regulatory authorities to support \ndevelopment  of  an  inclusive  financial  sector  and  implementation  of \nmeasures under the Program; and (iii) literacy programs (financial and \nbasic) conducted by or on behalf of financial services providers for clients \nand  potential  clients  to  improve  access  to  financial  services  and  the \nutilization of finance. \n   \n \n \n ", "iv \nBenefits and  The IAFSP will provide benefits for and have positive impacts on rural and \nBeneficiaries  urban communities, in particular the poor. These benefits are quantitative \nand qualitative in nature and include the following: \n \n(i)  a  deeper/broader  financial  sector  that  fosters  inclusive \neconomic  growth  and  reduces  poverty,  and  a  sustainable \nmarket-oriented microfinance sector with greater outreach to \nthe poor in rural and urban areas; \n(ii)  an  enabling  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework  that \npromotes  innovation  and  product  diversification  and  private \nsector participation; \n(iii)  improved credit information and land registration systems to \nprovide information for access to and delivery of credit; \n(iv)  removal  of  operational  bottlenecks  and  constraints  among \nintermediaries, including those inhibiting a new and a broader \nrange of services, and new technologies and applications, such \nas  mobile  money  transfer  and  very  small  aperture  terminal \n(VSAT) technologies to improve access to financial services in \nrural and remote areas;  \n(v)  increased opportunities for all types of clients, including better \nsystems and procedures for remittances and Islamic finance; \nand \n(vi)  increased  literacy  (financial  and  basic)  among  clients  and \npotential clients, leading to improved access to and utilization \nof financial services.  \n   \nRisks and  The success of the IAFSP depends upon a number of assumptions that \nAssumptions  are subject to different degrees of risk. Mitigating measures have been put \ninto place to address these risks. The primary risks are as follows: \n \n(i)  Consistency  and  commitment  may  wane.  Building  a  more \ninclusive financial sector requires a continued commitment to \nsector  reforms.  The  Government  has  shown  strong \ncommitment to achieving the goals of the Program, as reflected \nin the MTDF 2005-2010, its poverty reduction strategy, and \ninvestment and expenditures programs focusing on the poor \n(pursuant to the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act \n2005).   \n \n(ii)  Delays or disruptions may occur because of political instability \nor social unrest. These risks, and the international perception of \nsuch risks, are moderate to low. \n \n(iii)  A buyer or buyers willing to pay a fair market price within the \nspecified time period for a divesture of shares in Khushhali \nBank held by the National Bank of Pakistan may not be found. \nTo mitigate this risk and promote competition, the offer for sale \nof shares will remain open during the program period. \n \n(iv)  Funds available from the endowment fund may not be allocated \non  a  balanced  basis  across  financial  services  providers, \nauthorities and geographic areas. To increase transparency, \n ", "v \nand  disclosure  of  fund  allocations,  quarterly  reports  on \nrecipients  and  activities  funded  will  be  posted  on  the  SBP \nwebsite, and an ADB nominee will be appointed to the fund as \nan observer.           \n   \nTechnical  The proposed technical assistance (TA) will support timely implementation \nAssistance  of measures under the Program. The TA is estimated to cost $2,500,000 \nGrant  equivalent. ADB will provide $2,000,000 equivalent, to be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program,  and  the  Government  will \ncontribute $500,000 equivalent. TA funding is also under consideration by \nthe Government of Japan for financing by the Japan Special Fund (JSF). \nShould JSF funding become available, it would replace a corresponding \namount  of  funds  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  MOF  will  be  the \nExecuting Agency and provide the necessary counterpart staff and office \nspace  for  advisors  and  coordinate  activities  among  the  Implementing \nAgencies. The TA will be implemented over a 24-month period and is \nplanned to commence by March 2007 and be completed by March 2009.  \nConsulting  services  will  include  24  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services and 72 person-months of national consulting services. \nConsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). \n \n \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) two proposed \nloans and (ii) a technical assistance grant to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Improving \nAccess to Financial Services (Phase I) Program (IAFSP). \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  The overall fiscal deficit in FY2006 (excluding the impact of the earthquake) is estimated \nat PRs261.6 billion (3.4% of GDP). If earthquake-related spending is included, the size of the \ndeficit for FY2006 would be PRs327.3 billion (4.2% of GDP). Pakistan has achieved a high level \nof economic growth averaging over 7.5% for the past three years. With population growing at an \naverage rate of 1.9% per annum, the real per capita income has grown at an average rate of \n5.6%  per  annum.  The  economic  growth  has  supported  a  significant  reduction  in  poverty; \nhowever, 24% of the population or 36 million people continue to live below the poverty line, and \nthe incidence of poverty is 28% in rural areas compared with about 14% in urban areas. \nSustained growth is needed to reduce the poverty level still further. Further sustained economic \ngrowth requires a financial sector that is stronger and more effective in mobilizing savings and \nallocating these to productive use. Growth also must be more inclusive to ensure greater impact \non poverty, and the financial sector correspondingly must be inclusive and improve access to \nfinancial  services.  The  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  sustained  expenditures  on  pro-poor \nsectors is reflected in the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act, 2005. Under this law, \nsocial and poverty-related expenditures must be 4.5% of GDP or above in any given year and \nbudgetary allocations to health and education must double from the existing level in terms of \npercentage of GDP during the next 10 years. Inclusive growth and inclusive financial sector are \nindeed among the strategic concerns for the government. The Government\u2019s Medium-Term \nDevelopment Framework 2005\u20132010 and \u201cStrategic Directions to Achieve Vision 2030\u201d both \nhighlight this. What does inclusive financial sector mean in Pakistan? It means broadening the \noutreach and deepening the service while striving for efficiencies and maintaining sustainability.  \n \n3.  In  recent  years,  Pakistan  has  been  moving  towards  the  direction  of  developing  an \ninclusive financial sector. Under the earlier microfinance program,1 emphasis was placed on the \nestablishment of a statutory institution in 2000 as a strategic way to launch the sector. A small \nnumber of microfinance banks (MFBs) were subsequently established under separate law and \nregulations, however total outreach achieved to date is small and the majority of the poor have \nno  access  to  basic  savings/deposit  and  other  services.  This  proposed  program  marks  a \nsignificant step forward, and will assist the Government to implement timely reforms. It will build \non  the  past  success  and  address  emerging  issues,  and  brings  in  new  technologies  and \napplications that can expand outreach, lower cost of financial services and improve efficiencies. \nMost importantly, the program will support Government to implement policy and institutional \nchange in the financial sector with strategic and systematic frameworks that cut across the \nvarious subsectors.  \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Description and Performance2 \n4.  The majority of the population lives in rural areas where regular transaction services are \nlimited. To expand access by the poor and low-income families to sustainable financial services, \n                                                 \n1  Loan-1806-PAK: Microfinance Sector Development Program, approved 13 December 2000. \n2  Sources: State Bank of Pakistan, Pakistan Microfinance Network, Pakistan Post, and Poverty Alleviation Fund.  ", "2   \ndevelopment of the microfinance sector and the mainstreaming of microfinance services in the \nfinancial sector is essential. However, there are fundamental issues that need to be addressed \nthrough (i) effective land title and registration for poor and subsistence farmers; (ii) more mobility \nfor women and the large rural population; (iii) development of products and services that met the \nlocal needs, including products those that comply with Sharia (Islamic Law); and (iv) a shift from  \noverdependence on donor funds to increased commercialization of the sector for sustainable \nservices that can achieve scale for a successful national outreach. Access to credit is a form of \nfinancial capital. Microfinance credit and other financial services that help the poor to receive \nremittances and build savings safely can also help them gain access to other fundamental \nassets such as education, good health, shelter, and communications. Studies from a number of \ncountries have shown that the rural poor\u2019s lack of access to product and factor markets leaves \nthem largely bypassed by the growth process. Making markets work for the poor is therefore a \nkey element of a country\u2019s poverty reduction strategy.3 This supports the view that the poor \nshould be actively engaged in the growth process, as opposed to being left simply to share in \nthe benefits of growth (i.e. relying on the trickle-down effects of growth). Microfinance can help \nthe poor gain access to product and factor markets, and increase employment and income-\ngenerating activities, thereby actively engaging them in the growth process.       \n \n5.  Of Pakistan\u2019s 153 million people, more than 90 million live in rural areas where there are \nfew opportunities for employment other than self-employment or subsistence farming. Access to \ncredit for the rural poor is typically limited to local moneylenders who can charge excessively \nhigh rates of interest. Borrowing is often linked to life-cycle needs of poor households, such as \nthe need to pay for marriage expenses or health care, rather than for investment or productive \npurposes. In the 1950s and 1960s, the development of microfinance in Pakistan focused on \nagricultural  credit,  and  the  dominant  view  was  that  the  poor  primarily  needed  access  to \nsubsidized credit. In the 1970s, there was a move to nationalize banks and most credit to small \nfarmers was provided by government banks. Various schemes, including a small credit program \nfor women were provided through mobile teams. However, the fact that these initiatives were \nsubsidized and measures were not taken to ensure their sustainability meant that they led to the \nrent-seeking outcomes and poor financial performance that have emerged in other developing \neconomies.  \n \n6.  During the 1980s the Agha Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP) began operations \nin  the  northern  region  of  the  country  using  a  three-pronged  approach:  (i)  community \ndevelopment  through  community-based  organizations,  (ii)  infrastructure  development,  and \n(iii) resource mobilization through savings and credit. The success of this program led to other \nrural support programs (RSPs)4 and a holistic approach to rural development that dominated the \nmicrofinance  scene  in  Pakistan  in  the  1980s  and  1990s.  The  National  Rural  Support \nProgramme  (NRSP)  was  established  in  1991  by  the  Government.  It  is  Pakistan\u2019s  largest \nmultisectoral rural development program and operates in 35 districts. NRSP is involved in social \nmobilization  and  infrastructure  development  and  has  a  Microfinance  and  Enterprise \nDevelopment Programme.5 An individual lending approach targeting entrepreneurs in urban \nslums  was  also  developed  during  this  time,6  and  the  Kashf  Foundation,  modeled  on  the \nGrameen Bank of Bangladesh, started operations in 1994. These were followed by other similar \n                                                 \n3  Yao, Xianbin. ADB. 2003. Infrastructure and Poverty Reduction \u2013 Making Markets Work for the Poor. Manila. \n4   National Rural Support Programme, Punjab Rural Support Programme, and Sarhad Rural Support Programme   \n5  The credit program is fully operational in 25 of these 35 districts. As of 31 December 2005, it had made 609,196 \nloans since its inception, out of which it had 126,086 active borrowers. The cumulative distribution of loans was \nPRs7.76 billion, and it had an average loan size of PRs12,744. It had a loan recovery rate of 98.3%. NRSP also \nhas 31,000 savers, saving on average PRs17,000.  \n6  Orangi Pilot Project. \n ", "  3\ninitiatives. The community-based approach covers more than 86% of clients in the private \nsector, and, within this category one institution, the NRSP, covers 92%.  \n \n7.  Microfinance is an integral part of the financial sector and supports the growth of local \nmarkets. It can encompass a range of services, including deposits, loans, payment services, \nmoney transfers, remittances, leasing, and insurance. To date, however, the focus has been on \nthe provision of microcredit. Microfinance clients typically lack assets for collateral and are self-\nemployed in the informal sector or engaged in economic livelihood activities. Loans are based \non the borrower's household's net cash flow and on non-traditional forms of security, and may \nbe provided either on a group or an individual lending basis.7  Microfinance services in Pakistan \nare provided by microfinance banks (MFBs); commercial banks; rural support programs (RSPs); \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs); leasing companies and the national postal system.  \n \n8.  The Government established the first microfinance bank in Pakistan, Khushhali Bank \n(KB), under the KB Ordinance, 2000. While initial operations focused on a joint venture with the \nNRSP,  this  strategy  was  not  successful  and  the  concept  of  growth  through  \u201chubs\u201d  was \ndeveloped. To date, KB has 227,684 active borrowers, 63 branches, and 124 service centers \nnationwide. This has been an important development for the sector, but KB has focused its \nefforts only on the provision of microcredit. Two basic loan products are offered: (i) a bullet loan, \nwhich is primarily for supporting agricultural activities; and (ii) a monthly installment based loan \nfor trading activities. KB does not offer deposit services to its clients, although savings services \nare an important service for the poor. The bank currently uses only $30 million of its credit line \nfor its loan portfolio and $40 million is invested in its treasury operations.  KB has not yet \nachieved financial sustainability (after exclusion of direct and indirect subsidies), continues to \nrely on donor credit line, and has a low retention rate of clients (about 27% compared with about \n70% for many NGOs).     \n \n9.  The  Microfinance  Institutions  Ordinance,  2001  was  enacted  to  promote  access  to \nsustainable microfinance for the poor and ultimately to lead to poverty reduction. This ordinance \n(as amended by the Finance Bill, 2006) specifies that a microfinance client must be below a \nthreshold  income  level  set  by  the  State  Bank  of  Pakistan.  Prudential  regulations  for \nmicrofinance banks and institutions set the maximum microfinance loan size at PRs100,000. \nThe effect of the Microfinance Institutions Ordinance has been to expand the outreach of \nmicrofinance through the creation of licensed microfinance banks (MFBs) providing services to \napproximately 300,000 poor and very poor clients. However, the microfinance sector in Pakistan \nis relatively small compared with similar sectors in other countries in the region and is estimated \nto reach only 10% of the 6 million poor households in the country. Most of the poorest people \nhave  no  access  to  formal  or  semi-formal  financial  services,  since  providing  microfinance \nservices to the poorest involves high operating costs, intensive social intermediation, and high \nrisk. However, empirical evidence suggests that there is a large potential large demand for \nmicrofinance services among the poorest, especially for savings and remittances facilities.   \n \n10.  Besides KB, 5 other banks are licensed in Pakistan,8 including four nationwide banks \nand two district-wide banks. It is estimated that 40 microfinance institutions (MFIs) operate in \nthe country, and that 19 of these capture almost 99% of the market. As of May 2006, there were \n584,836 active borrowers with a gross loan portfolio of PRs6.03 billion,9 compared with 510,000 \n                                                 \n7  Microfinance lending methodologies include the Grameen Bank Approach (group lending) and Association of \nSocial Advancement (ASA) Methodology (individual lending).  \n8  Microfinance banks licensed in Pakistan as of July 2006 are Khushhali Bank, the First Microfinance Bank, Tameer \nMicrofinance Bank, Rozgar Microfinance Bank, the Network Microfinance Bank, and Pak Oman Microfinance Bank.  \n9  Reported by Pakistan Microfinance Network. Annual Report 2004/05. \n ", "4   \nactive borrowers and a gross loan portfolio of PRs5 billion in 2005. The total gross outstanding \nloans and the share of active borrowers are 48% within microfinance banks and 52% in other \nMFIs. The profile of borrowers shows that women account for 16% of loans and men for 84%. \nPortfolio quality is a concern. Although cumulative recovery is 96%,10 the portfolio-at-risk (PAR) \nis 18.5%. The average loan size of microfinance banks is currently about PRs9,300, and, as of \n31 March 2005, 65% of outstanding loans were for agriculture inputs and livestock, 26% for \nenterprises, and 9% for other purposes.    \n \n11.  Microfinance  banks  and  commercial  banks  conducting  microfinance  business  are \nregulated and supervised by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Other types of institutions are \ngenerally self-regulating members of the Pakistan Microfinance Network (PMN), and follow the \nPMN framework of disclosure of financial and operational performance. PMN was established in \n1997 and is dedicated to improving the reach and sustainability of microfinance in Pakistan. It \npublishes  an  annual  performance  indicators  report.  Its  mission  is  to  support  provision  of \nfinancial services to the poor, with a focus on retail microfinance. The objectives of PMN are to: \n(i) promote an enabling environment that benefits the work of all stakeholders; (ii) build the \ncapacity  of  stakeholders,  especially  retail  microfinance  institutions;  and  (iii)  improve \ntransparency  and  accountability  by  promoting  the  publication  and  widespread  use  of \nperformance measures and standards related to the work of microfinance institutions.  \n \n12.  MFIs can register themselves at the district level (where the capitalization requirement is \nPRs100 million), at the regional level (where the requirement is PRs150 million, recently added \nthrough amendments to the Microfinance Institutions Ordinance), at the provincial level (where \nthe requirement is PRs250 million), or at the national level (where the requirement is PRs500 \nmillion). However, given the scale of operations, these capital requirements may be too high, \nand recent prudential regulations from the SBP have, to a certain extent, reduced them by \naccepting the outstanding portfolio (if of a good quality) of the MFI, at the time of transformation, \nas part of the initial capital.   \n13.  Financial services are also provided through Pakistan Post, a state enterprise providing \na range of postal products and public services, including financial services, through a network of \n12,267 post offices across the country. Financial services include remittance services through \nmoney orders. A money order is an order issued by the post office for the payment of a sum of \nmoney through the agency of the post office. Almost all post offices are money order offices, \nand the maximum size of a money order is PRs10,000. Postal order services are also provided, \nto fulfill requirements for small remittances. For faster transmission, a fax money order service is \noffered at district and other post offices. To cater to the needs of the urban population and the \nbusiness community, the postal draft service is a remittance service operating among head post \noffices. It is used for remittances by individuals or organizations and the maximum postal draft \nvalue is PRs200,000. In addition to remittance services, Pakistan Post also has a saving bank. \nServing as an agent of the Ministry of Finance, the saving bank has played a crucial role in \nencouraging and mobilizing savings among the general public. In most remote areas, it is the \nonly banking services available. Pakistan Post does not provide loans.  \n14.  The Government of Pakistan created the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF) in \n199711  as  an  autonomous  body  working  with  local  partners  to  provide  loans,  grants  and \ntechnical assistance to the poorest individuals and communities in the country. Sponsored by \nthe Government of Pakistan and funded by the World Bank and others, the PPAF currently has \n                                                 \n10  Data for 11 MFIs. \n11  The PPAF was funded by a $90 million World Bank credit and an endowment of $10 million from the Government \nof Pakistan in 2000.  \n ", "  5\na resource base of $500 million. As the apex institution wholesaling funds to nongovernment \norganizations, PPAF selects partners with well-targeted community outreach programs that are \ncommitted to enhancing the economic welfare and income of disadvantaged peoples. Benefits \naccrue directly to the vulnerable through income generation, improved physical and social \ninfrastructure, and training and skill development support. At present, the PPAF is working with \n56 partner organizations in 96 districts of Pakistan. Since its inception, PPAF has become an \nactive and dynamic partner in promoting the growth of the sector and to date has disbursed \nPRs1.2 billion to 27 MFIs supporting loans for a cumulative total of 125,000 clients.  \n \nB.  Issues, Constraints, and Opportunities \n15.  The above description highlights that the microfinance sector has a number of players \nwith  different  character  and  institutional  arrangements.  Key  issues,  constraints,  and \nopportunities facing the development of an inclusive financial sector are the following:  \n \n(i)  lack of a national strategy for an inclusive sustainable financial sector, \n(ii)  overdependence on donor funds for both wholesale finance and operating costs,  \n(iii)  technical  challenges  and  high  transaction  costs  because  of  an  absence  of \ninfrastructure and a lack of mobility of clients, in particular women and people \nliving in rural areas,     \n(iv)  lack of reliable business and credit information that impedes the access of credit \nand increases delivery costs,  \n(v)  lack of diverse financial services and products to meet local needs and priorities  \n(vi)  unequal treatment of MFBs, including different legal status,  \n(vii)  lack of education and literacy (basic and financial) especially among women and \nin rural areas, and \n(viii)  capacity building of financial services providers and authorities \n \n16.  Figure 1 gives a schematic illustration of these issues and constraints for both financial \nintermediation and client/potential clients\u2013the two broad groups of stakeholders. \n \n1.  Lack of National Strategy for Inclusive Financial Sector \n17.  State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has emphasized that building sustainable financial services \nsystems for the poor is of critical interest and requires laying a foundation for potentially profitable \nmarket and enterprises that can develop ways to reduce the costs and risks of serving them. Both \nSBP and the banking industry are working towards exploring options on how to reach financial \nservices  to  un-banked  segments  of  the  population.12  While  encouraging  e-banking  and  e-\ncommerce, SBP is now working closely with the banking industry to explore options for adoption \nof new technologies to reach under-banked areas with the objective of enhancing access of rural, \nagriculture and microfinance credit and to attract remittances. In this respect, strategic alliances \nwith overseas partners with special compatibility are encouraged by SBP. SBP\u2019s reorganization in \nSeptember  2006  also  reflects  the  dynamic  markets  and  developments  taking  place  across \nPakistan\u2019s financial markets. A Development Finance Group was established within SBP to create \nan  enabling  environment  to  facilitate  intermediation  and  help  develop  capacities  to  better \nunderstand the new niche areas such as infrastructure, Islamic banking, housing, SME and \nmicrofinance. A creation of a Task Force for a National Strategy for an Inclusive Financial Sector \ncomprised  of  representatives  from  SBP,  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  Ministry  of  Information \nTechnology (MOIT), Pakistan Post, Pakistan Microfinance Network and other concerned agencies \nwill facilitate the development of a comprehensive and crosscutting national strategy that can build \n                                                 \n12  State Bank of Pakistan news release dated 16 October 2006. \n ", "6   \non first generation reforms undertaken in the various sub-sectors and take the country forward \nwith a national strategy for an inclusive financial sector.        \n \n \nFigure 1: Overview of Constraints and Opportunities \nIntermediaries\nCommercial  Islamic  Microfinance  Khushali Bank  NGOs-MFIs  Pakistan \nBanks (39)a  Banks (6)  Banks (5)  (statutory institution)  Post \nProvide good  Offers Shariah  Limited products   No deposit/limited  Microcredit only  Vast national \nrange of products  products   services  infrastructureb \nand services for \nmiddle and upper  Developing  Offer nonfinancial \ntier banking  capacity  Limited outreach  services  Good local \nclients \nNot focused on  knowledge and \nsmall scale/  customer \nmicro products  Limited outreach  Unviable business  Limited scale  relations \nOffer small scale  in rural areas  model \nbasic account \nservices   Good client  Limited \nCulturally  Good client  Capacity/low  retention  partnerships \nacceptable  retention  client retention  with retail FIs \nMicrofinance not \na core area  Willing to \nNot authorized to  Perceived by public  experiment with  Open to new \nreceive remittances  as Government  new technology  partnerships \nWilling to  from overseas  institution  with private \nexperiment with  workers  sector \nnew technology \nWilling to \nexperiment with \nnew technology \na 11 licensed for Islamic banking  services. \nb Over 12,000 post offices  Clients/Potential Clients\nSource: ADB, State Bank of Pakistan, Pakistan \nPost, Pakistan Microfinance Network. \n-  Operate   \nLack  \u2212  Limited  Limited Mobility   Lack of  - Have   Have     enterprises/  \navailable  or no  \u2013 of women   education/  access to    computerized     conduct     \nand  credit  \u2013 geographically  low literacy  technology  national ID     livelihood  \nsuitable  history    (basic and    cards (47%     activities \nfinancial  \u2212  No credit  Majority of  financial)   - Own   issued,   \nproducts  informati population in rural  cellular   remaining to  - Have capacity  \non  areas  phones  be issued in    to save \nbureau    near term)   \ncoverage  - Receive  \nfor  remittances from  \nNGOs- family members  \nMFIs  working overseas \n \n \n   \n \n ", "  7\n2.  Overdependence on Donor Funds  \n \n18.  Historically, the development of microfinance and SME finance has been supply-driven \nand focused on the provision of subsidized credit lines to promote growth. A common view was \nthat the poor were \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d of finance schemes, without the capacity to save. Those who \ndid save were regarded as preferring non-financial forms of saving, and it was felt that the poor \ncould not afford the full cost of credit at commercial rates. This view was a common view taken \ninternationally in early stages of development of the sector when less information was available \nand little was understood about the full capacity of this segment of the market. This earlier view \nled to an institutional response in Pakistan and other countries that was supply-led and focused \non  subsidized  credit  programs  by  governments  and  international  donor  agencies.  Private \nfinancial institutions developed a high dependency on external borrowings and mobilization of \nsavings was neglected. In the long run, sustainable finance requires a shift from a supply focus \nto a demand-driven market system. Subsidized credit lines and programs can \u201ccrowd out\u201d \nprivate sector development and undermine the development of savings services which can \nprovide a lower cost, sustainable source of operational funds required to achieve national scale. \nOverdependence on donor funds can also result in complacency and lack of efforts to offer \nsavings/deposit  services  to  clients,  as  has  been  the  case  with  KB,13  which  provides  no \nsavings/deposit services to clients. The commercialization of microfinance for the development \nof sustainable financial services that can achieve the scale necessary for national outreach is a \ntopic  that  has  been  researched  and  documented  in  many  international  studies.14  The \nrecognition of profit opportunities for this market segment is also seen with the continued entry \nof new institutions, both at the country level and internationally. Funds such as the Global \nCommercial Microfinance Consortium15 are indicative of the type of facilities being created to \ncapitalize on the growing opportunities for microfinance.     \n \n3.  Technical Challenges and High Transaction Costs  \n19.  At present, there are limited commercial or microfinance bank operations in rural areas \nproviding a full range of financial services for the poor. Although Pakistan Post offers a great \nopportunity for expansion through a network of more than 12,000 post offices, this capacity has \nnot yet been tapped for the widespread delivery of diverse financial services.  Despite the \nexpansion of institutional and policy-directed credit, informal markets still supply most of the \ncredit needed by the poor because the banking sector primarily services urban and industrial \nneeds. Credit in rural areas is mostly supplied by commission agents and other middlemen at \nhigh interest rates. Shortages of capital at affordable rates constrain the growth of the rural \neconomy,  and  prevent  efficient  resource  mobilization  and  risk  management.  Insufficient \ninfrastructure and outreach in rural areas has resulted in some cases in debt bondage for \nworkers.16  This  is  a  system  of  advance  payment  and  \u201cvoluntary\u201d  economic  transactions, \nwhereby a worker transacts with the employer for credit, repaying the debt by working for the \ncreditor. Given the high rates and low wages that often prevail, it is difficult for workers to repay \n                                                 \n13 Under the Microfinance Sector Development Program credit facility, the relending rate to KB specified was the \naverage weighted cost of deposits in the banking industry calculated periodically by SBP. Such formula while \nmarket linked is lower than market cost to MFBs.  \n14 Examples include ADB. 2004. Commercialization of Microfinance: Perspectives from South and Southeast Asia. \nManila; and World Bank. 2006. Transforming Microfinance Institutions Providing Full Financial Services to the \nPoor. Washington DC. \n15 The Global Commercial Microfinance Consortium was launched in November 2005 by Deutsche Bank and the US \nAgency for International Development.   \n16  An ADB loan in 2002 addressed various issues related to bonded labor (ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation \nof the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Sindh \nRural Development Project (Summary Procedure). Manila).    \n ", "8   \nthe advances and they remain bonded to the employer. In Pakistan there is a large potential for \nfinancial services providers to collaborate with public or private agencies through targeted, \ncompetitive and market-driven public interventions to increase their outreach. The national \npostal infrastructure provides one strategic option that could widen national outreach with little \ninvestment.   \n20.  Although there is debate as to the true level of access to credit for women, it is low \nrelative to experiences in the region and internationally. Women have taken out only 16% of \ntotal outstanding loans. The main reasons for this are constraints on the mobility of women, \nespecially in rural areas, and other cultural constraints. As women may not be allowed to travel \nunaccompanied or outside village areas, their access to resources is considerably curtailed. \nMany women do not possess identity cards, although they are available to all residents. The \nprincipal barriers to gender equality include a perception of women as lower status dependents; \nlack of information about opportunities, assets and services; absence of control over resources; \nrestricted  mobility;  non-marketable skills;  violence  and fear  of  violence;  and a shortage  of \navailable services and opportunities.17 Some institutions are exploring how to reach women, \nsuch as Tameer Microfinance Bank, which is recruiting a female sales force to improve outreach \nin communities.18  \n \n21.  Adoption  of  new  technology  and  applications  can  provide  the  strategic  means  of \nreaching women and people living in rural and remote areas. Measures that can be undertaken \nin the near term to increase both physical access to financial services and participation in rural \ncommunities among the poor and illiterate include the use of mobile money transfers using cell-\nphone-based technology to provide low-cost alternatives and access to the poor where there \nare no bank branches. Such applications are being implemented in the Philippines and some \ncountries in Africa where cell phone penetration is high, even among poor households. The cell \nphone  penetration  in  Pakistan  is  currently  about  30%  and  is  growing  rapidly,  indicating  a \npotential market for such technological solutions. For improving access outside cellular service \nareas, technology is evolving toward access via satellite to cell phones, and pilot projects are \nunderway  in  the  region.  The  poor  are  often  \u201cconnected,\u201d  own  cellular  phones,  and  may \npurchase a cellular phone before many other basic items. Being poor does not mean being \nwithout technology. Technology can improve access to financial services as well as to market \nand  other  information  that  can  positively  impact  the  livelihood  of  the  user.  The  National \nDatabase  Registration  Authority  (NADRA)  is  currently  providing  new  computerized  national \nidentity cards that are biometrically enabled (finger and face). As of March 2006, about 47% of the \nadult population had received identity cards, and full adult coverage is expected soon. The \nmission of the NADRA program19 is to build a biometrically-enabled, centralized public data \nwarehouse to support all facets of public life, including public records, banking, travel, education, \nand health care. This system will support access to finance for all and will facilitate access through \ntechnologies such as cell-phone-based money transfers and remittances. To facilitate adoption of \ntechnologies and applications in the financial services sector, measures from the Central Board \nof Revenue (CBR) will be important in order for financial services providers to avail of the \nreduced rate of import taxes and sales tax exemption on technology hardware that are provided \nto other service sectors. The rationalization of registration and annual license fees by the \nPakistan  Telecommunications  Authority  (PTA)  will  also  be  important  to  support  increased \noutreach of financial services through adoption of technologies and applications.    \n \n                                                 \n17 Mumtaz, K. 2006.

Lack of Reliable Business and Credit Information and History \na.  Outmoded Land Registration System \n22.  Lack of access to credit because of the poor quality of land records prohibits people, \nespecially  inhabitants of rural  areas, from participating  in  economic activities.  Land  titles are \nmaintained manually and are often not relied on by financial institutions when they are considering \nloan applications because of concerns about the accuracy, completeness, and authenticity of data. \nBanks and other financial institutions have their own processes for verifying the title and value of \nland, which makes borrowing against land titles cumbersome, difficult and costly. Land records \nform the  basis for  assignment and settlement  of land titles and are  crucial  for proving  land \nownership, land taxes, reforms, and administration. Computerized land records will help in the \neffective collection and analysis of data, which can be used to verify collateral for loans.  \n \n23.  In 2003, a pilot scheme for the computerization of Revenue Management Information \nSystem (REMIS) began in five districts of Sindh Province. In July 2006, the Government of \nSindh  approved  a  project  called  the  Computerization  Program  of  Revenue  Collection, \nAssessment and Accounting System, with Special Emphasis on Ownership of Title through \nREMIS. The total cost of the project is PRs432 million, wholly funded by the Government of \nSindh. The goals of the project are to (i) maintain records of rights over land; (ii) execute an \nefficient mutation process related to land ownership; (iii) improve land records service delivery \nand transparency; and (iv) computerize and generate all revenue forms electronically. The \nproject will cover all 23 districts in the province. The Government of Sindh asked ADB for \nadvisory technical assistance for capacity building, and for funding for a geographic information \nsystem  (GIS)  and  software  for  land  surveys  and  GIS  records.  The  establishment  of  an \nautomated land registration and records management system in Sindh will improve the quality \nof land records and processes, and increase access to bank credit for small and subsistence \nfarmers. This initiative complements the land registration project launched in Punjab province in \nJune 2006 with support of the World Bank and the Department for International Development of \nthe UK (DFID).20  These two provinces account for 79% of the population and 44% of the land \narea in Pakistan (Balochistan accounts for 44% of the country\u2019s land area, yet only about 5% of \nthe  population).  Development  of  automated  land  registration  in  these  provinces  will  have \nsignificant impact for improving the quality and security of land records. \n  \nb.  Limited Credit Information Bureau Coverage    \n24.  Lack of reliable business information and credit history has been a major impediment to \nthe growth of financing for the poor and for microenterprises. The establishment of a credit \ninformation bureau (CIB) for banks has been an important development, but the reporting \nrequirement has previously been too high to capture potential microfinance customers. SBP has \nnow  removed  the  reporting  limit of  PRs500,000  which means  that  information  of  value  to \nmicrofinance will be captured. SBP and the Pakistan Microfinance Network recognize the need \nfor a credit information bureau for all types of institutions (regulated and unregulated), including \nmicrofinance  banks,  rural  support  programs  (RSPs),  and  other  NGOs.21  Broader  credit \ninformation coverage is especially important in rural areas where RSPs and NGOs are key \nproviders of financial services.  Expanded credit reporting can provide both negative information \nabout defaults by potential new customers, and positive information on credit histories that can \nreduce potential adverse selection and moral hazards which increase costs of lending. Broader \nCIB coverage can also prevent the over-indebtedness that can occur when borrowers take \n                                                 \n20  DFID and World Bank. 2006. Land Records Management and information Systems Program. Washington. \n21  A draft bill to facilitate establishment of private credit information bureaus is under preparation. \n ", "10   \nmultiple loans when credit histories remain private between the institutions and their borrowers. \nThis  will  be  increasingly  important  as  commercial  lenders  expand  their  targeting  of  the \nmicrofinance market. An expanded credit reporting system can also promote competition among \nlenders,  and  provide  good  customers  with  alternative  sources  of  finance.  PMN  has  been \nexamining credit information systems in countries such as Bolivia that address credit information \nfor both formal and informal lenders. One issue for establishment of a private CIB is the funding \nfor ongoing operations \u2013 will the demand for reports and the willingness to pay be sufficient to \nsustain operations. According to PMN, that potential was not clear 3 years ago. Today, based \nupon a PMN competition survey conducted in Lahore in 2006, PMN officials state that the \ndemand is high for such credit information service in the expanding and competitive Lahore \nmarket.  A  feasibility  study  to  determine  the  potential  design,  operations,  and  initial capital \nrequired is needed to pilot an expanded CIB covering regulated and unregulated institutions.     \n   \n5.  Lack of Diverse Financial Services and Products  \n25.  To date, most MFIs in Pakistan have focused only on credit delivery and other financial \nservice providers are only now beginning to examine how diverse products and services can be \noffered to poorer communities. The National Human Development Report22 showed that the \npoor have very high ratios of loan dependence on landlords, and that such a high rate of \nindebtedness is a major hurdle for poverty reduction programs that are based on credit alone. \nThe lack of functioning financial markets has affected the poor disproportionately. With few \nassets that can serve as collateral, they have traditionally been shut out of formal finance \nmarkets. As a result, the poor have had limited possibilities for consumption smoothening in \nresponse to income and other risks, or for financing production enterprises and longer-term \ninvestments through saving, lending, or insurance. Poverty is thus perpetuated, as the poor \ncannot  exploit  economic  opportunities.  Savings  services,  insurance,  money  transfers, \nremittance services, and products and services that comply with  Sharia (Islamic Law) are \namong the range of services needed for low income families and the poor.   \n \na.  Savings and Remittances \n26.  Savings are needed by all households for smoothening income and consumption flows, \nbut they are especially vital for the poor. Savings can mitigate risks and finance productive \ninvestments in informal enterprises and farms. The poor save in a variety of financial and non-\nfinancial ways and their primary need is to swap small savings flows for lump sums. Although \nthe capacity to save is present including in Pakistan's rural areas, it is not being tapped because \nof a lack of institutional outreach. As a result, people in rural areas often save through livestock \nthat can be bought and sold when needed. Hoarding gold and silver is also common in rural and \nsemi-urban areas. Traditionally, jewelry is meant to be kept for a lifetime and transferred to the \nchildren, only to be utilized as a last resort through sale or mortgage. Mobilization of savings is \nessential if sustainable microfinance is to be developed nationally. As MFI deposits increase, so \ndoes the pool of available resources for MFIs to provide other services and expand their reach. \nThe rate of savings mobilization will have a critical impact on the targeted growth and outreach \nof the microfinance sector. One potential source for rapid mobilization of savings is remittances \nfrom overseas workers. Funds from inward remittances are the second largest source of foreign \nexchange inflows after exports. Although many remittances are through formal channels, an \nequal or greater number take place through informal channels.  Many poor do not have access \nto formal money transfer and remittance services. Instead they rely on informal channels, such \nas the physical transport of cash across borders. Formal money transfers can be costly, but cell-\nphone-based technology can facilitate money transfers at a greatly reduced cost to the sender. \n                                                 \n22  NHDR, 2003. National Human Development Report. Islamabad. \n ", "  11\nIn FY2006, through formal systems Pakistan received $4.6 billion in remittances, an increase \nfrom $4.2 billion in FY2005.23 The inflow of remittances into Pakistan during FY2006 from USA, \nSaudi Arabia, United Arab of Emirates, GCC countries (including Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and \nOman), United Kingdom and European Union countries amounted to $1,242.49 million, $750.44 \nmillion,  $716.30  million,  $596.46  million,  $438.65  million  and  $119.62  million  respectively. \nRemittances received from Australia, Canada, Japan, Norway, Switzerland, and  other countries \nduring the last fiscal year amounted to $724.07 million. \n \n27.   Facilitation of cheap, safe and speedy transmission of funds from overseas Pakistanis to \ntheir families is an active agenda of the Government and SBP. To facilitate home remittances \nand to expand formal services to households and promote a robust and competitive market, \nSBP has issued instruction to commercial banks to establish \u201cHome Remittance Cells\u201d with \ndedicated professional personnel and IT experts.

An \nequal  or  greater  amount  of  remittances  is  considered  to  flow  through  informal  channels, \nrepresenting both a loss of revenue for financial services providers and a welfare loss for \nremitters  who  are  forced  to  send  money  home  via  risky,  costly  and  otherwise  inefficient \nremittance channels. The formalization of this market would be both pro-poor and welfare \nenhancing for the economy as a whole.24 Authorizing microfinance banks to receive remittances \ndirectly from overseas Pakistanis will be important for expanding remittance services, especially \nfor those microfinance banks expanding into rural areas where many remittances are sent.   \n \nPotential Mobilization of Savings from Increased Remittancesa  \nthrough Formal Channels ($ millions) \n \nPercentage of Remittances  Projected Percentage of Informal Remittance Flows Captured  \nReceived and Retained as  by Formal Institutions  \nSavings  20% = $920   30% = $1,380  40% = $1,840 \n10  92  138  184 \n15  138  207  276 \n20  184  276  368 \na Calculated using assumption of $4.6 billion estimated informal remittance flows to Pakistan. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \nb.  Islamic Financial Products and Services \n28.  The Second World Islamic Economic Forum was held in Pakistan in November 2006, \nmarking the increasing importance of Islamic financial services in emerging markets worldwide. \nMemoranda of understanding were signed at the forum, including one between SBP and the \nInternational Centre for Education in Islamic Finance25 (INCEIF) for the development of Islamic \nfinance in Pakistan.  There is a recognized and growing demand for Islamic financial products and \nservices in Pakistan.  In rural areas, it is believed that, even if financial services are available, they \nmay not be used because they do not comply with Sharia (Islamic Law). To meet this demand \nand to provide a more diversified product and service sector, Islamic financial services need to be \nfurther developed and offered through multiple channels with product designs that can reach the \nmicrolevel. SBP has shown a strong commitment to promoting development of Islamic financial \nservices in Pakistan. SBP established an Islamic banking department, and task forces have been \nset  up  to  promote  Islamic  research  and  development  and  Islamic  liquidity  management \n                                                 \n23  Source: State Bank of Pakistan. \n24  State Bank of Pakistan press release dated 9 September 2006, \u201cFacilitation of Home Remittances to Pakistan.\u201d   \n25  The International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance (INCEIF) is located in Malaysia. \n ", "12   \ninstruments.26  SBP  is  also  member  of  the  Islamic  Financial  Services  Board  (IFSB),  an \ninternational standard setter that provides a forum for supervisory and regulatory bodies and \nfinancial institutions offering Islamic financial services to discuss key issues on regulation and \nsupervision.27 An Islamic finance institute in Pakistan could support development and training for \nprofessionals in the sector. Exploration of options for an institute and conducting a feasibility study \ncould facilitate establishment. \n \n6.  Unequal Treatment of MFBs \n29.  A key issue for more rapid development of financial services in remote and rural areas is \nthe need for equal treatment for all microfinance banks. The role of private microfinance is \ncritical, but  emphasis on a single institution, the KB has had limited results. Initially viewed as a \nstrategic approach to launching the sector, dedicating resources to a single bank has resulted in \na skewed and inefficient market. This included the dedication of endowment funds available for \nits use which were not available to other practitioners. To remove this unfair advantage and to \nensure transparency, such funds should be factored into the overall costs of banking for KB. \nThe existence of two ordinances, one for the KB and one for all other microfinance banks, \nheightens the perception that KB is separate from other market players, and the image of KB as \na Government institution. The shares of KB are owned by 16 private banks, one of which, the \nNational Bank of Pakistan (NBP), is majority owned by the Government. NBP\u2019s shareholding in \nKB is currently 23.5%. The main advantage enjoyed by KB is the large credit and special funds \ntargeted for it, and SBP is trying to resolve issues arising from existing restrictions under these \nfunds.  Introduction  of  a  draft  bill  to  bring  all  MFBs  under  the  same  legal  and  regulatory \nframework would be an important measure for equal treatment of MFBs.  \n \n7.  Literacy (Basic and Financial) \n30.  Literacy is important if the disadvantaged poor are to be introduced to a formal or \nsemiformal market-oriented institutional environment and effectively access financial services. \nMany of the poor are not well informed about microfinance services or how to access them. In \naddition, many people are not literate and cannot even sign their names. Loan officers can \nexplain to them the loan agreement and obligations, but many people can not read what is \nbeing signed, which increases the vulnerability of the poor. Some microfinance institutions, such \nas Rozgar Microfinance Bank and the Network Microfinance Bank, support their client with basic \nliteracy  training.  Literacy  and  education  are  important  for  determining  the  likelihood  of \nhousehold participation and access to financial services. Survey data28 on the microfinance \nsector in Pakistan show that household heads participating in microfinance had significantly \nhigher literacy rates than household heads in non-participating households (67% literate males \nin participating households as compared with 47% in non-participating households).  Similarly, \n35% of respondents from participating households had completed their matriculation or attained \na higher level of education, while only 14% of respondents among non-participating households \nhad achieved this level. The disparity is clear and the potential impact large. The survey also \nshowed that a considerable proportion of households experienced a sustainable increase in \ntheir income after receipt of a loan.  \n  \n                                                 \n26  State Bank of Pakistan press releases dated 27 February 2006, 31 March 2006, and 10 April 2006. \n27 ADB joined the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) as an Observer Member in 2003. The International \nMonetary Fund and the World Bank are Associate Members. IFSB is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia \nand currently has 94 members (full, associate and observer). Additional information is available at www.ifsb.org.  \n28  A survey of 20 sample villages and 307 households was carried out in March 2004 in several districts of Sindh. The \nstudy also uses the results of a small sample field survey of 277 households that was conducted for the United \nNations Development Programme\u2019s National Human Development Report.  \n ", "  13\n8.  Capacity Building of Financial Services Providers and Authorities  \n31.  Strengthening the institutional capacity of financial services providers is important if they \nare to grow and reach the poor. There needs to be a wider and clearer application of the \nprinciples  of  sustainable  microfinance,  and  interest  rates  need  to  cover  the  true  cost  of \noperations.  Even  the  best  institutions  need  to  improve  their  credit  management,  their \ndelinquency management practices, and their accounting for bad debts and provisioning in their \nincome statements. Portfolio quality is a concern, with portfolio-at-risk (PAR) reported to be \n18.5%. The private sector has to apply its resources more strategically, improve on efficiency \nstandards, and use better management information systems, which can help it to enhance \noutreach and quality. Many MFIs lack basic skills for sustainable, effective, and efficient delivery \nof microfinance services to the poor. Inefficiencies can result in higher operating costs that \ntranslate into unnecessarily high interest rates for the poor. MFIs face high transaction costs in \nthe operation of their business; however improved efficiencies and skills development could \nhelp to lower these costs.  \n \n32.  Adoption of technologies and applications will also require capacity building and training \nacross all types of financial services providers (commercial banks, Islamic banks, MFBs, NGOs, \nRSPs,  and  others).  Literacy  and  education  are  important  for  determining  the  likelihood  of \nhousehold participation and access to financial services. Survey data29 on the microfinance \nsector in Pakistan show that household heads of households participating in microfinance had \nsignificantly higher literacy rates among than did those in non-participating households (67% \nliterate  males  in  participating  households  as  compared  with  47%  in  non-participating \nhouseholds).  Similarly, 35% of respondents from participating households had completed their \nmatriculation or attained a higher level of education, while only 14% of respondents among non-\nparticipating households had achieved this level. The disparity is clear and the potential impact \nlarge.  The  survey  showed  that  a  considerable  proportion  of  households  experienced  a \nsustainable increase in their income after receipt of a loan.   \n \n33.  Enhancing the institutional capacity of the SBP and Government authorities will also be \nimportant for the sector. Training of SBP officers in new management information systems for \non-site and off-site surveillance and in applications of new technologies and systems for money \ntransfer and remittances will help to build capacity for an expanding sector. Within the provincial \ngovernments and at the local district level, training for automated land registration, records \nsystems, and reporting will also be needed to facilitate access to records required by financial \ninstitutions.         \n \nC.  External Assistance \n \n34.   Significant external assistance has been provided by funding agencies to support poverty \nreduction and to accelerate development of the financial sector. A development coordination matrix \nis included in Appendix 4. Assistance to Pakistan\u2019s financial sector includes support (debt and \nequity)  to  retail  institutions  for  expanding  outreach  in  microcredit,  new  product  development, \nmicroleasing operations and research for more client-responsive financial services. In terms of \nsupport for retail microfinance, the World Bank is supporting the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund \n($360 million), an apex institution that funds civil society institutions in areas of microcredit, small-\nscale community infrastructure and capacity building support, including operational assistance. The \nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC) has provided equity support to two licensed microfinance \n                                                 \n29  A survey of 20 sample villages and 307 households was carried out in March 2004 in several districts of Sindh. The \nstudy also uses the results of a small sample field survey of 277 households that was conducted for the United \nNations Development Programme\u2019s National Human Development Report.  \n ", "14   \nbanks (MFBs). The Swiss Agency for Development has supported programs in leasing, retail \nmicrocredit and enterprise development. USAID through its improving access to finance project \nhas supported retail initiatives of KB and PPAF and has funded market responsive research \nthrough Shore Bank International. Assistance from the EC, Grameen Foundation, IFAD and UNDP \non a smaller scale has supported various capacity-building initiatives, primarily for retail NGOs and \ntheir clients in microcredit. DFID, in collaboration with the World Bank, is also conducting a national \naccess to finance survey to be completed by June 2007. The DAWN Asia Finance Conference \n2006, \u201cAsian Banking: Paradigm Shift\u2014Microfinance: Empower the Unbanked\u201d, was held in May \n2006 in Islamabad, Pakistan and co-sponsored by ADB, DFID, the EC, IFAD, SDC, UNDP, \nUSAID, and the World Bank.   \n \n35.  With regard to assistance in the area of technology and applications, the Consultative \nGroup to Assist the Poor (CGAP) has been working worldwide to help build financial systems for \nthe poor. While much progress has been made, CGAP has noted that more than 3 billion people \nworldwide still lack access to finance. CGAP believes that technology is likely to play a major \nrole in achieving universal access to formal financial services, but notes that companies that use \ntechnological approaches to reach underserved populations often lack the right expertise and/or \nsufficient  funding.  To  support  development,  CGAP  operates  a  $10  million  fund  that  offers \nsupport in the form of strategic guidance, technical and regulatory expertise, and co-financing in \nthe form of grants. Eligible firms are from financial services; telecommunications; technology; \nand  other  related  industries  who  are  interested  in  providing  formal  financial  services  to \ndeveloping  countries,  using  cost-effective  and  commercially  viable  technology-based \napproaches. Applicants can be for profit or non-profit, but each project must be designed for \nfinancial viability.30 Information on the CGAP fund and application forms for proposals were \ndistributed in October 2006 at the seminar \u201cImproving Access to Financial Services: Mobile \nMoney Transfer and Beyond\u201d co-sponsored by ADB and SBP in Pakistan. \n \nD.  Lessons Identified \n36.  Experience  of  ADB-supported  reform  programs  in  microfinance,  rural  finance,  SME \nfinance,  and  non-bank  financial  institutions31  all  highlight  the  importance  of  Government \ninstitutions as facilitators and enablers but the need for provision of services to be left to \nfinancially viable private sector institutions. Consultative and participatory processes should \nprecede any policy development if the policy is to have broad ownership and buy-in from all \nstakeholders. Targeted subsidies by the government or sponsored institutions should be strictly \nlimited to situations where market failure prevents delivery through the private sector (e.g., in \ndifficult terrain or where the client base is widely disbursed). In terms of demand, all financial \nproducts must be demand-driven. Finally, rigorous controls, transparent policies, and good \nbusiness  ethics  must  be  established  and  enforced.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  statutory \ninstitutions that are created as development vehicles are at risk of being influenced over time by \nother priorities or agendas of Government, even when the shares of the institution are majority \nheld by the private sector.  Such influence can divert attention and focus away from the original \ncore mandate, and undermine the frameworks and plans established at the outset as appears to \nbe the case with the KB created under the earlier microfinance program.32 Lessons learned from \nADB\u2019s microfinance operations33 are similar to those experienced by other funding agencies and \n                                                 \n30 Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) Technology Program.

In \nparticular, the financial system approach is the key to achieving sustainable results and to \nmaximizing development impact. This approach emphasizes an enabling policy environment, a \nstrong  financial  infrastructure,  and  financial  intermediaries  that  are  committed  to  achieving \nfinancial viability and sustainability within a reasonable period and can provide a variety of \nfinancial services, not just credit, to the poor.   \n \n37.  A study of Pakistan\u2019s microfinance policy in 200634 noted that the Government\u2019s catalytic \nrole in the start-up phase had been a success, and that it was now time for the Government to \nstep  back  and  let  the  microfinance  industry  evolve  under  its  own  momentum.  The  study \nemphasized that the Government no longer needed to be a provider of microfinance services, \nnor did it need to take an interventionist approach to the services provided. The key role of \nmicrofinance  policies  at  this  stage  is  to  provide  an  enabling  environment  for  microfinance \nservices provided by institutions that are financially sustainable, or can become sustainable in a \nvery short time. The study observed that development was undermined when subsidies were \npassed straight to the borrower in the form of lower interest rates, and/or by subsidies that are \nused by MFIs to avoid the need to establish lending services in order to build adequate capital. \n     \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n38.  The goal of the proposed Program is to assist the Government to reduce poverty, build \nan inclusive financial sector, and promote sustainable economic growth by using technology \nand applications to lower the cost of delivery of financial services and to improve the efficiency \nof  these  services.  The  program\u2019s objective  is  to  ensure access  to sustainable  institutional \nfinancial  services  for  most  poor  and  low-income  households  and  their  microenterprises  at \ncompetitive prices. The program will support the Government to improve the performance and \nefficiencies of the financial sector; promote diversification and innovation in product and service \ndelivery; and increase outreach in rural and remote areas. Private sector participation and \ninnovation in the delivery of products and services will be supported including savings services, \ntransfer remittance services, and products and services that are Sharia (Islamic Law) compliant. \nIncreased access to a range of financial services on a sustainable basis will enable the poor to \nengage in income generating activities, thereby reducing poverty and vulnerability. It will support \nthe Government\u2019s core reforms to increase access and accelerate growth nationwide, including \nprograms for literacy.         \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n39.  The policy framework and actions that have been agreed with the Government are \ndescribed in Appendix 3. The key measures are as follows. \n \n1.  Development of Policy, Legal, and Regulatory Frameworks \n40.  Reforms will be undertaken to support more rapid growth and outreach of financial \nservices to the poor, including in rural and remote areas. A fundamental policy shift from the \nprevious model based on supply-led credit and subsidies that has led to sector overdependence \non donor funds credit to a model that is demand-driven and market-oriented will support private \n                                                 \n34  Oxford  Policy  Management.  2006.

The shift in focus \nfrom emphasis on a statutory institution to more balanced sector-wide support and development \nwill also promote a more robust and competitive financial market. Cabinet approval of a draft bill \nto ensure that all MFBs, including KB, are licensed and operating under the same legal and \nregulatory framework, and MOF submission of the draft bill to Parliament for enactment will be a \nkey  measure  supported  by  the  program  to  create  an  integrated  legal  framework  for  all \nmicrofinance banks and equitable treatment for financial institutions seeking to provide services \nto the poor. The Program will also support the Government\u2019s development of a national strategy \nfor an inclusive financial sector that integrates efforts in various sub-sectors and encompasses \nall types of financial institutions, including commercial banks, microfinance banks, rural support \nprograms, and other NGOs. It will take a medium- and long-term view of sector integration and \nthe mainstreaming of the poor in the financial services sector.    \n \n41.  Measures to support NGOs that want to transform themselves into formal financial \ninstitutions will be supported. The transformation of NGOs and rural support programs (RSPs) \ninto microfinance banks will help to expand the number of institutions that can provide a full \nrange  of  financial  products  and  services,  including  savings  and  deposit  services  and \nremittances, to the poor. SBP guidelines have been issued to support NGOs transforming \nthemselves into formal financial institutions. SBP will also provide capacity building and evaluate \nsuch institutions, and review its guidelines. The program will support the establishment and \ndevelopment  of  an  on-site  and  off-site  surveillance  capacity  for  SBP  for  microfinance \ninstitutions. This will help to ensure effective oversight and will require staff training. IT and \nsystem software design will be approved and made operational for these surveillance systems. \nUnder  the  Program,  SBP  will  issue  guidelines  for  banks  regarding  access  to  credit  and \ncomputerized Fard/E Pass books.  \n \n42.  To support the mainstreaming of microfinance and the development of wider distribution \nchannels  for  financial  services  for  the  poor,  SBP  guidelines  have  been  issued  to  support \ncommercial banks to undertake microfinance business activities. In addition, basic banking \naccounts (minimum initial deposit of PRs1000, no minimum balance) have been introduced by \nall commercial banks to extend their reach to low-income families and the poor. The Program \nwill  support  Government  measures  to  rationalize  tax  incentives  to  promote  mobile  money \ntransfers, mobile banking, and the use of related technology and applications for expanded \nnationwide outreach of financial services.  Current import taxes on technology hardware are \nhigh (up to 20%), presenting a barrier to firms\u2019 applications of technology for growth and \neconomic development. As microfinance services and mobile banking operations expand to \nprovincial areas, a clear and consistent tax policy should support expansion and eliminate \nuncertainties as to cost, ad hoc demands, or extended delays in implementation due to court or \nother actions. A Central Bureau of Revenue (CBR) amendment to CBR Notification S.R.O. \n575(I)/2006 will be issued to allow financial services providers to take advantage of (i) a reduced \nrate of import taxes of 5% and (ii) a sales tax exemption on technology hardware identified by \nthe State Bank of Pakistan-Ministry of Information Technology (MOIT) working group to promote \naccelerated  applications  of  modern  technologies.  This  will  ensure  that  financial  services \nproviders enjoy the same benefits as other service sectors in the adoption of key technologies. \nMOF will also issue a policy statement encouraging provincial and district authorities to provide \nconsistent  tax  treatment  with  respect  to  mobile  banking  operations35  to  promote  national \noutreach and entry into rural areas.   \n \n                                                 \n35  The proposed grant assistance for Islamic Republic of Pakistan: Microfinance for the Poorest, under consideration \nfor financing by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, will support pilot tests for mobile banking in Pakistan. \n ", "  17\n43.  The  Program  will  support  the  Sindh  government  to  establish  an  automated  land \nregistration and records management system to improve the quality and security of land records \nto improve access to credit and investor confidence. A pilot scheme for the computerization of \nRevenue  Management  Information  System  (REMIS)  will  be  implemented  by  the  Board  of \nRevenue of Sindh Government in five districts: Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, Sukkur, Khaipur, and \nLarkana (covering 2,146 land registers.) The Board of Revenue of Sindh Government will \nextend REMIS to the remaining 18 districts of Sindh Province to improve transparency in record \nkeeping;  promote  secure,  reliable  and  accountable  transactions;  improve  the  quality  of \nownership and title records; expedite the resolution of land-based disputes; and facilitate access \nto credit and investment. \n \n2.  Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening/Restructuring  \n44.  Credit  Information  Bureau  (CIB)  coverage  will  be  expanded  under  the  Program  to \ninclude all types of financial service providers (regulated and unregulated) including MFIs, \nMFBs, NGOs, RSPs, and others). A lack of reliable business information and credit history has \nbeen  a  major  impediment  to  the  financing  of  microenterprises  and  households.  A  bureau \ncovering all types of financial service providers will support increased access to credit promote \ncompetition and increase financing options for many borrowers. A feasibility study of a credit \ninformation bureau covering all types of financial service providers in rural and remote areas, \nwill be undertaken by SBP in cooperation with the Pakistan Microfinance Network (PMN). A pilot \nCIB will be launched by SBP and PMN in accordance with relevant law. \n \n45.  The Program will support the deployment of technologies and applications and the \nremoval of obstacles for mobile money transfer and remittances for lower-cost and efficient \ndelivery of services nationwide.  An industry forum has been conducted by SBP co-sponsored \nby ADB for banks, microfinance institutions, exchange companies, telecommunications firms, \nand others on mobile money transfer, VSAT, and other technologies for improving access to \nfinancial  services.  The  forum  provided  a  good  regional  information  exchange,  including \npresentations from experts on current technology and systems in the Philippines. An SBP-MOIT \nWorking Group comprising senior representatives will examine issues affecting the introduction \nof mobile money transfer and technologies. MOIT will issue, as necessary, rules and regulations \nto support technical implementation of mobile money transfers and remittances, including VSAT \nand other technologies based upon SBP plan and recommendations. SBP will develop and \nsubmit to MOIT a plan for options for establishment of an integrated national platform for mobile \nmoney transfer for many users (e.g., banks, microfinance banks, NGOs, telecommunications \nfirms,  and  exchange  companies)  for  lower-cost  and  more  efficient  delivery  of  services \nnationwide. Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) will rationalize registration annual \nlicense fees on VSAT and other technologies to support applications if technology for outreach \nof financial services. \n \n46.  The  Program  will  increase  the  capacities  of  financial  services  providers  to  apply \ntechnologies and systems for mobile money transfer, VSAT and other technologies. To support \ntechnological developments, the Program will establish an endowment fund to complement \ncapacity building activities of the CGAP worldwide technology fund. An endowment fund in the \namount of $20 million equivalent will be established at the SBP. The income account of the \nendowment fund will be used to fund training and capacity building for (i) microfinance banks \n(national, regional, and district) that currently operate in or will expand into rural and remote areas; \n(ii) new technologies and applications, including mobile money transfer and VSAT technologies \nfor improved access to financial services in rural and remote areas; (iii) literacy (financial and \nbasic) programs for potential clients; and (iv) training of government authorities, and SBP, to \n ", "18   \nsupport the development of an inclusive financial sector and implementation of the Program. SBP \nquarterly reports on capacity building and training activities supported under the endowment fund \nand list of recipients will be posted on the SBP public website, and an ADB observer will be \nappointed to the fund governing body. The institutional capacity of financial institutions will be \nstrengthened, especially financial institutions operating in rural areas or with plans to expand into \nrural areas. This will include microfinance banks, NGOs transforming into microfinance banks, and \ncommercial banks expanding services to the poor. Training will be provided in credit management \nand delinquency management practices; accounting for bad debts; and provisioning in income.  In \naddition  to  capacity  building  of  financial  institutions,  enhancing  the  institutional  capacity  of \nauthorities, including SBP, will be undertaken. Training of SBP officers will cover implementation \nof new systems for on-site and off-site surveillance, and training in applying new technologies and \nsystems for mobile money transfer and remittances.   \n \n47.  Restructuring and strengthening of KB will also be undertaken under the Program and \nmonitored by SBP to ensure it can deliver sustainable financial services efficiently and cost-\neffectively.  SBP  will  provide  directions  to  KB  on  sustainable  operations  and  best  banking \npractices. KB\u2019s strategy and 5-year operational plan will be approved by SBP and implemented \nthrough 2008. The bank will also issue an analysis of its low client retention rate (30%) followed \nby an action plan to improve client services and retention. Following enactment of the law to \nbring all MFBs under the same legal and regulatory framework, SBP will license KB as an MFB.  \nMOF/National Bank of Pakistan will commence divestiture of its shareholding in KB, and the \noffer will remain opened during the program period, unless shares are sold at an earlier date.  \n \n3.  Product Diversification and Innovation \n48.  The Program will support the diversification of the financial services sector in Pakistan. A \nfull range of services, including savings, remittances, and other services, is needed to support \nthe economic activities and development of rural households and the poor. Innovation and \nalternative financing for rural households will be supported. A task force36 has been established \nby SBP to promote research and development in Islamic banking, and draft guidelines and \nregulations will be prepared by SBP to support the provision of Islamic microfinance services \nand products through multiple channels by Islamic banks, commercial banks, and microfinance \nbanks. SBP will also issue regulations and guidelines to support MFBs\u2019 applications of such \ntechnologies as mobile money transfer via cell-phone- based technology and VSAT systems. \nFeasibility studies will be undertaken on (i) the potential for an Islamic finance institute in \nPakistan, (ii) national VSAT applications and other technology options to expand access to \nfinancial services in rural areas; and (iii) carbon credits (grant) financing37 for households and \nthe poor. It is important to note that during the life of the Program, banks in Pakistan can also \napply for an ADB guarantee for their funding lines to support new banking operations, or for the \nexpansion of existing operations in connection with Program initiatives for improving access to \nfinancial services.38          \n \n49.   The  Program  will  support  SBP  actions  to  facilitate  low-cost,  safe  and  speedy \ntransmission of remittances from overseas workers to Pakistan. SBP has issued instructions to \ncommercial  banks  to  establish  and  make  fully  operational  a  \u201chome  remittance  cell\u201d  with \ndedicated professional staff, including IT experts, and banks will approve and submit an annual \n                                                 \n36 The task force comprises the Shariah advisors of Islamic banking institutions in Pakistan.  \n37  For summary description of carbon finance and potential applications at the household level see Appendix 6. \n38 During the life of the program, ADB\u2019s Office of Cofinancing Operations may consider proposals from Pakistan \nbanks for ADB guarantees in amounts ranging from $5 million to $50 million (or greater) with tenor up to 20 years \nor more to support banking operations.   \n ", "  19\nstrategic  plan  for  the  mobilization  of  remittances.  A  draft  bill  amending  the  Microfinance \nInstitutions Ordinance 2001, or setting forth the necessary provision(s) in the relevant law, will \nbe approved by the Cabinet and submitted by MOF to Parliament for enactment to allow MFBs \nto receive remittances directly from overseas workers. \n \n50.  The  Program  will  support  the  development  of  public\u2013private  partnerships  between \nPakistan Post and private sector financial institutions in order to increase outreach in rural \nareas. Such partnerships will enable the national postal infrastructure to provide a full range of \nfinancial services in rural and remote areas. Pakistan Post\u2019s network of 12,267 post offices \nnationwide  can  provides  a  foundation  for  small  institutions  to  expand  rapidly  with  minimal \ninvestment. Post offices\u2019 knowledge of the community and the postmen\u2019s relationships with \npeople are also invaluable assets in working toward greater rural outreach to the poor. The \npartnership arrangements will complement existing savings and other services of Pakistan Post. \nA strategic partnership framework and model agreements will be prepared by Pakistan Post, in \nconsultation with financial institutions. Postal branches will be identified by Pakistan Post for \ninitial partnerships and pilot schemes, and partnerships will be offered to the private sector. \n \n4.  Financial and Basic Literacy  \n51.  The Program will support improvements to national literacy and education as a means of \nimproving access to financial services for the poor and for rural households. An endowment fund \nwill be established at SBP to support financial services providers that conduct literacy programs \nand training for clients and potential clients, either directly themselves or through subcontractors. \nThe endowment fund will be established in the amount of $20 million equivalent as referenced \nabove. SBP quarterly reports on capacity building and training activities supported under the \nendowment fund and list of recipients will be posted on the SBP public website and an ADB \nobserver will be appointed to the governing body of the fund.   \n \nC.  Financing Plan \n52.  It is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s policy reforms under the Improving \nAccess to Financial Services Program with two loans. The Borrower will be the Islamic Republic \nof Pakistan. The loans are (i) a loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \n(OCR), with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a term of 15 years \nincluding a grace period of 3 years, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the loan \nagreement; and (ii) a loan of Special Drawing Rights 13,425,000 ($20,000,000 equivalent) from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter, a term of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years, \nand such other terms and conditions as set forth in the loan agreement. With respect to the first \nloan, the Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n   \n53.  The  following  factors  were  taken  into  account  in  determining  the  loan  size:  the \nimportance of improving access to financial services for economic growth and poverty reduction, \nthe strength of the program, the financial and institutional costs associated with implementing it, \nand the Government\u2019s overall financing needs. The program proceeds will help create fiscal \nspace for the Government to meet the financing requirements for earthquake reconstruction and \nother expenditures for the social sector. Associated program costs include a reduction in import \n ", "20   \ntaxes and an exemption from the sales tax on technology hardware and components; the \nremoval of other obstacles to the deployment of technology, such as high registration and \nlicensing  fees;  capacity  building  of  Government  authorities  and  agencies;  and  institutional \nstrengthening and restructuring of institutions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n54.  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  financial  management \narrangements  are  assessed  as  adequate.  Accumulated  experience  in  implementing  a  large \nnumber of program loans demonstrates MOF\u2019s proven competence and capacity to effectively \ncarry out the financial management of the Program. Implementing Agencies will be State Bank of \nPakistan (SBP); Central Bureau of Revenue (CBR); Ministry of Information Technology (MOIT); \nPakistan Post (PP); and the Board of Revenue of Sindh Government. A program coordination and \nimplementation unit (PCIU) will be established in Islamabad at the MOF for program coordination, \nmonitoring and management across agencies. Working groups will also be established to include \nall Implementing Agencies for a good collaboration, communication and timely implementation of \nmeasures  under  the  program.  In  addition  to  the  PCIU,  SBP  will  provide  office  facilities  for \nconsultants in Karachi to facilitate coordination and the oversight of consultants. The PCIU will be \nresponsible to provide the required program reports and information for implementation of the \nprogram.  Establishment of the PCIU will be a condition for loan negotiations.   \n \n55.  To assess the impact of the program on poverty, existing data from Federal Bureau of \nStatistics, Pakistan\u2019s official statistical organization, will be used. The Pakistan Social and Living \nStandards Measurement (PSLM) survey provides key social indicators at national, provincial \nand district levels. A household integrated economic survey (a component of the PSLM survey) \nprovides important data on household income, consumption expenditure and patterns at the \nnational  level,  with  a  rural\u2013urban  breakdown.  The  information  on  household  income  and \nexpenditure is used by Centre for Research on Poverty Reduction and Income Distribution to \nestimate  poverty  levels.  In  addition,  the  Pakistan  Microfinance  Network  (PMN)  publishes \nperformance measures and standards related to the work of retail microfinance providers. \nMembers  of  PMN  include  microfinance  banks,  NGOs  that  are  specialized  microfinance \ninstitutions, NGOs running microfinance operations as a part of their integrated development \nprograms,  rural  support  programs,  and  commercial  financial  institutions  involved  in \nmicrofinance. Published data include the number of active borrowers, the gross loan portfolio, \nand outstanding loans for female clients. The State Bank of Pakistan also collects data on the \nbanking sector, which will be used to assess the program impacts. \n \nE.  Procurement and Disbursement \n56.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  simplification  of  disbursement  procedures  and  related \nrequirements for program loans, procurement of goods and services produced in and originating \nfrom ADB's member countries will be made with due consideration to economy and efficiency in \naccordance  with  standard  Pakistan  public  sector  procedures  and  normal  private  sector \ncommercial practices acceptable to ADB. Disbursement of the loan proceeds will be permitted \non the basis of certification provided by the Borrower, confirming that in each year in which \nproceeds of the loan are expected to be disbursed, the value of total Pakistan imports minus \n(i) imports from nonmember countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) imports financed under \nother official development assistance, will be equal to or greater than the amounts expected to \nbe disbursed during such year. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to \nverify the validity of the certification issued by the Government with each withdrawal application. \n \n ", "  21\n57.  ADB's policy document Anticorruption (1998, as amended to date), was explained to and \ndiscussed  with  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption document are included in the \nloan regulations. The National AntiCorruption Strategy (NACS), introduced in Pakistan in 2002, is \nbeing implemented under the guidance of the National Accountability Bureau. The strategy and \nimplementation plan is consistent with the ADB and OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia-\nPacific.  Action plans are under implementation in the legislature and political systems, public \nsector management, development, procurement and contracting, financial management, public \naccountability bodies, anticorruption agencies, legal system and judiciary, media, civil society and \nthe private sector. The Government is undertaking reforms at the federal level in budgeting and \nfiscal monitoring, including submission of funding proposals based on objectives and a medium-\nterm budgeting framework. The World Bank\u2019s Project to Improve Financial Reporting and Auditing \n(PIFRA) seeks to address weaknesses in accounting and audit, including the introduction of a \nnew  accounting  model  that  is  consistent  with  international  best  practice.  There  are  fiscal \nmonitoring committees at federal and provincial levels and the Government publishes federal \nquarterly  fiscal  accounts  on  its  website.  The  Auditor  General\u2019s  Department  is  following \nInternational Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) best practices in its reform \nagenda. \n \nF.  Counterpart Funds \n58.  Counterpart funds will be used for the financial and institutional costs associated with \nimplementing  the  reform  program  and  other  development  financing  needs.  The  entire \ncounterpart funds of the $20 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources loan shall \nbe transferred as a capital contribution to the Improving Access to Financial Services Fund, an \nendowment fund to be established to support (i) capacity building and training of financial \nservices providers to promote  expansion into rural areas; product and service innovation, \nincluding savings, remittances and Islamic financial services; adoption and integration of new \ntechnologies and applications for improving access to financial services; (ii) capacity building \nand training of Government and regulatory authorities to support development of an inclusive \nfinancial sector and implementation of measures under the Program; and (iii) literacy programs \n(financial and basic) conducted by or on behalf of financial services providers for clients and \npotential clients to improve access to financial services and the utilization of finance. \n \nG.  Monitoring and Tranching \n59.  The  expected  program  completion  date  is  24  months  from  effectiveness  (expected \nDecember 2006). The program loan closing is expected 3 months after program completion. \nThe loan will be released in two tranches. The first tranche of $120 million equivalent will be \nmade available when the Government has satisfied loan effectiveness and first tranche release \nconditions. The first tranche will comprise $100 million from the OCR of ADB and $20 million \nequivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The second tranche of $200 million will be \nfrom OCR, is expected to be released within 24 months of loan effectiveness, and will be \nreleased upon satisfactory compliance with the agreed upon conditions.  \n \nH.  Subsequent Program/Phase II  \n60.  The Government\u2019s Improving Access to Financial Services (Phase I) Program will focus \non measures pertaining to the development and mainstreaming of microfinance in the financial \n ", "22   \nsector and the implementation of strategic cross-cutting measures to increase national outreach \nof sustainable financial services across a range of financial services providers. The Government \nplans to further develop financial services in phase II to address second generation reforms to \nsupport other deprived segments of the economy like, SMEs, agricultural finance, and other \nareas which would ultimately lead to an integrated financial system capable of meeting the fast \ngrowing requirements of every segment of the economy over the long-term. The Government is \nadopting a sequenced approach with the initial focus on critical constraints considered under the \npresent program. \n \nV.  PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n61.  The  proposed  technical  assistance  will  support  sector  developments  for  improved \naccess to financial services and implementation of key measures under the Program. The \nprimary components and activities planned under the TA include:   \n \n(i)  advisory to assist Government in the development of a National Strategy for an \nInclusive  Financial  Sector,  including  advice  and  information  on  current  best \npractices and developments in the region and internationally, and  support in \nconducting  stakeholder  consultations  and  forums  to  promote  a  strong \nparticipation and inclusion of stakeholder groups;    \n \n(ii)  technical  and  legal  assistance  for  development  of  regulatory  frameworks  to \nsupport  new  technological  applications  for  delivery  of  financial  services, \nincreased  rural  outreach,  and  lower  cost  funds  transfers  and  remittances  in \nPakistan; Feasibility study for national VSAT applications and other technology \noptions to expand access to financial services in rural areas; \n \n(iii)  develop and conduct a national field survey on Islamic finance in cooperation \nwith  the  Islamic  Banking  Department  of  SBP.  Survey  to  cover  the  Islamic \nfinancial markets to provide (a) important country baseline data for monitoring the \nsector characteristics, demand, and growth; and (b) information on current issues \nand opportunities for expansion and development, in particular in rural areas;   \n \n(iv)  prepare  draft  model  agreements  and  frameworks  to  facilitate  partnerships \nbetween private sector financial services providers and the Pakistan Post for \nefficient and lower-cost delivery of financial services by MFBs in rural and remote \nareas utilizing existing national postal network infrastructure;  \n \n(v)  assess potential for establishment of a credit information bureau for all types of \ninstitutions, including MFBs, RSPs, and other NGOs, to support improved access \nto  financial  services  and  lower  cost  service  through  improved  information \nsystems, reporting and transparency; Conduct feasibility study in cooperation \nwith the Pakistan Microfinance Network for establishment of credit bureau;   \n \n(vi)  advisory on international frameworks and country case studies for channeling \ncarbon credits (grant) financing to the household level; Conduct feasibility study \nfor carbon credits (grant) financing39 for households and the poor in Pakistan. \nStudy  to  include  needs  assessment  for  training  and  capacity  building  of \nhouseholds and external maintenance services.     \n \n                                                 \n39  For summary of carbon finance and potential applications at the household level see Appendix 6. \n ", "  23\n(vii)  conduct  feasibility  study  for  establishment  of  an  Islamic  Finance \nInstitute/Business and Finance Academy in Pakistan; and \n \n(viii)  assist  Sindh  Government  in  the  selection  and  development  of  a  geographic \ninformation system (GIS) to support the establishment of an automated land \nregistration system for Sindh Province. Provide training and capacity building of \nSindh officials for GIS.  \n \n62.  The proposed technical assistance will support timely implementation of measures under \nthe Program. The TA is estimated to cost $2,500,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $2,000,000 \nequivalent, to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program, and the Government \nwill contribute $500,000 equivalent. TA funding is also under consideration by the Government \nof Japan for financing by the Japan Special Fund (JSF). Should JSF funding become available, \nit would replace a corresponding amount of funds from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. MOF will be \nthe Executing Agency and will provide the necessary counterpart staff and office space for \nadvisors  and  coordinate  activities  among  the  Implementing  Agencies.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented  over  a  24-month  period  and  is  planned  to  begin  by  March  2007  and  to  be \ncompleted by March 2009.  Consulting services will include 24 person-months of international \nconsulting services and 72 person-months of national consulting services. Consultants will be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (April  2006, as \namended from time to time). Consulting services will be provided through a firm, and the \nselection method will be the quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) method. A cost estimates \nand financing plan and terms of reference for consultants are included in Appendix 6.  \n \nVI.  PROGRAM, BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS   \nA.  Benefits and Impact on Poverty \n63.  The  IAFSP  will  provide  many  benefits  and  will  have  positive  impacts  nationwide, \nincluding for the poor and rural households.  Some of the key benefits include: \n \n(i)  a  deeper/broader  financial  sector  that  fosters  inclusive  economic  growth  and  \nreduces poverty, and a sustainable market-oriented microfinance sector with greater \noutreach to the poor in rural and urban areas; \n(ii)  an enabling regulatory and supervisory framework that promotes innovation and \nproduct diversification and private sector participation; \n(iii)  improved credit information and land registration systems to provide information for \naccess to and delivery of credit; \n(iv)  removal of operational bottlenecks and constraints among intermediaries, including \nthose inhibiting a new and a broader range of services, and new technologies and \napplications, such as mobile money transfer and very small aperture terminal (VSAT) \ntechnologies to improve access to financial services in rural and remote areas;  \n(v)  increased  opportunities  for  all  types  of  clients,  including  better  systems  and \nprocedures for remittances and Islamic finance; and \n(vi)  increased literacy (financial and basic) among clients and potential clients, leading to \nimproved access to and utilization of financial services. \n \n ", "24   \nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguards \n64.  No impacts related to ADB\u2019s environment, resettlement, or indigenous peoples policies \nare anticipated under this program.  A Summary Poverty and Social Strategy is included in \nAppendix 7.  \n \nC.  Risks \n65.  The success of the IAFSP depends upon a number of assumptions that are subject to \ndifferent degrees of risk. Mitigating measures have been put in place. The primary risks are as \nfollows.  \n \n(i)  Commitment to reform may wane. Building a more inclusive financial sector \nrequires a continued commitment to sector reforms. Although a lessening of \ncommitment  is  a  risk,  the  Government  has  shown  strong  commitment  to \nachieving the goals of the Program, as reflected in its MTDF 2005-2010, its \npoverty reduction strategy and investment and expenditure programs focusing on \nthe poor (pursuant to the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act , 2005).   \n(ii)  Delays or disruptions may occur because of political instability or social unrest. \nThese risks, and the international perception of such risks, are moderate to low. \n(iii)  A buyer or buyers willing to pay a fair market price within the specified time \nperiod for shares in KB held by the National Bank of Pakistan may not be found. \nTo mitigate this risk and promote competition, the offer for sale of shares will \nremain open during the program period.  \n(iv)  Funds from the endowment fund may not be allocated on a balanced basis \nacross  financial  services  providers,  authorities  and  geographic  areas.  To \nincrease transparency and disclosure of fund allocations, quarterly reports on \nrecipients and activities funded will be posted on the SBP website, and an ADB \nnominee will be appointed to the endowment fund as an observer.         \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n66.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  SBP  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Government and SBP will (a) maintain the policies adopted and actions \ntaken  prior  to  the  date  of  the  loan  agreements  for  the  program  loans,  as \ndescribed in the development policy letter and the policy matrix, for the duration \nof the IAFSP and subsequently; (b) promptly adopt the other policies and the \nother actions included in the IAFSP as specified in the development policy letter \nand the policy matrix; and (c) ensure that such policies and actions continue in \neffect for the duration of the IAFSP and subsequently. \n(ii)  The  Government  and  SBP  will  actively  assist  and  support  ongoing  program \nmonitoring and evaluation by facilitating consultations with related agencies and \nother key stakeholders as appropriate. \n(iii)  The Government and SBP will provide ADB with an opportunity to comment on \nrelevant  strategies,  studies  and  draft  laws,  ordinances,  regulations  and \nguidelines that are likely to impact on program objectives and implementation. \n(iv)  SBP will ensure that the endowment fund rules, including provisions on fund \nmanagement, investment policy, grant selection criteria and accounting and audit \nprocedures, are prepared with the concurrence of ADB. \n ", "  25\n(v)  Financial services providers will be entitled to avail of the 5% reduced import tax \nrate and sales tax exemption on technology hardware. \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that adequate and timely resources are made available \nto SBP and the relevant agencies to facilitate implementation of the Program.  \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n67.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the loan of $300,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Improving \nAccess  to  Financial  Services  (Phase  1)  Program  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of 15 years including a \ngrace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board; \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 13,425,000 to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan for the Improving Access to Financial Services (Phase \n1) Program, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge at the rate \nof 1.0% per annum  during the grace period and 1.5%  per annum thereafter; a term \nof  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years;    and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan \nAgreement presented to the Board; and \n(iii)  the provision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000  to \nthe Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Improving Access to Financial \nServices. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n      President \n \n \n \n22 November 2006 \n ", " 26  Appendix 1 \nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n1.  The development of microfinance and the mainstreaming of microfinance in the financial \nsector are essential elements of building an inclusive financial sector with national outreach. \nThe microfinance sector in Pakistan is recognized as still in early stages of development. The \nissuance of Khusshali Bank Ordinance in 2000 and the Microfinance Institutions Ordinance in \n20011  provided  the  basic  legal  framework  for  establishment  of  microfinance  banks  and  a \nregulated microfinance sector. It is estimated that 40 MFIs currently operate in Pakistan,2 and \nthat 19 institutions account for almost 99% of the microfinance market. This includes the 6 \nlicensed microfinance banks, and 13 other MFIs that are members of the Pakistan Microfinance \nNetwork (PMN). PMN issues comprehensive reports for annual performance indicators tracking \nthe developments and performance of microfinance banks, rural support programs and other \nNGO-MFIs. For purposes of this RRP the term microfinance finance institutions (MFIs) will be \nused to broadly refer to all types of institutions providing microfinance. Table 1 below provides a \nlist of the 19 primary institutions providing microfinance services.             \n \nTable A1.1: Primary Institutions Engaged in Microfinance \n \nInstitution   Type of Institution \n1.

State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data shows that the microfinance banks (MFBs) have 92 \nbranches or about 20% of the 400 total branches for MFBs and MFIs. However, MFBs also \noperate 145 services centers (one-room branches) providing additional outreach for the MFBs. \nIncluding those centers, MFBs would then account for about 43% of all units. As for the total \n                                                 \n1  The  Microfinance  Institutions  Ordinance  2001  applies  only  to  microfinance  banks  and  not  other  types  of \nmicrofinance institutions. \n2 Small & Medium Enterprises Department, State Bank of Pakistan. 2006. Microfinance Sector in Pakistan: An \nOverview. Islamabad. \n ", "  Appendix 1  27\ngross outstanding loans of PRs4.7 billion, PMN members and MFBs have around 50% share \neach,  although  MFBs  have  only  about  48%  of  the  total  active  borrowers.  With  regard  to \noutreach to women, MFBs have shown a significantly lower percentage of women borrowers as \ncompared with other types of MFIs. The recent data show only about 20% of active borrowers at \nMFBs are women, down from 31% at year-end 2005.3 This compares to 53% women among \ntotal active borrowers for other types of MFIs at year-end 2005. The lower rate of women \naccess to microfinance in Pakistan is generally considered due to the constraints on mobility of \nfemales, especially in the rural areas, and other cultural constraints. The fact that other MFIs \nhave, however, achieved a higher rate of women access than MFBs, may indicate that the non-\nfinancial services provided by the MFIs have played an important role in the mobilization and \naccess of women. It is also recognized that institutions with a primary mandate to service \nwomen, such as Kashf Foundation, have demonstrated successful in reaching women including \nin rural areas. This indicates a need on the part of MFBs to adopt and/or adapt some portion of \noperations in order to tap the women\u2019s market.

Unregulated MFIs are not allowed to take voluntary deposits, as they are outside the \nSBP  regulatory  framework  which  provides  the  necessary  measures  and  oversight  for \ninstitutional soundness and safety to deposits. Unfortunately, licensed MFBs have been slow to \nprovide this important service to clients, and have concentrated on credit as the primary service. \nThis disparity is clearly seen in the data as the total number of depositors at MFBs was only \n37,245 (or about 14.7% of the number of borrowers). The reliance on subsidized credits and the \nnegative impact on mobilizing deposits and the development of a sustainable microfinance \nmarket have been earlier discussed in the Sector Description and Performance. Although four \nhold licenses to operate nationwide, efforts have concentrated on the district of Karachi. With an \nestimated  population  of  over  12  million,  the  Karachi  district  continues  to  represent  a  vast \npotential market for MFBs. \n4.  An  examination  of  microfinance  loans  by  sector,  shows  a  rural  focus  of  MFB \nmicrofinance services with 65% of outstanding loans for agri-inputs and livestock. The SBP data \nfor microfinance loans by sector are classified into four main categories: agri-input (41%); \nenterprise  loans  (26%);  livestock  (24%);  and  other  purposes  (9%).  Figure  1  shows  the \nbreakdown as of 31 March 2005.  Although an increase in both rural and urban microfinance \nservices are expected in the coming years, rural microfinance services will continue to dominate \nwith 68% of the population in rural areas.   \nTable A1.4: Mobile Phone Operators in Pakistan \nGrowth Rate of Mobile Cellular Subscribers FY 2000\u20132006  \n \nGrowth \nYear  Mobilink  Ufone  Paktel  Instaphone Telenor Warid  Total \nRate \n2000  114,272      80,221  112,000        306,493  15.39 \n2001  309,272  116,711  96,623  220,000        742,606  142.29\n2002  800,000   350,000  218,536 330,000        1,698,536  128.73\n2003  1,115,000   550,000  319,400  420,000         2,404,400  41.56 \n2004  3,215,989  801,160  470,021 535,738         5,022,908  108.90\n2005  7,469,085 2,579,103  924,486 454,147  835,727 508,655  12,771,203 154.26\n2006  17,205,555 7,487,005 1,040,503 336,696  3,573,6604,863,138 34,506,557 170.20\nJul\u20132006  18,321,599 7,884,703 1,121,821 316,000  3,887,7745,246,565 36,778,462   \nAug\u20132006  19,181,846 8,356,668 1,458,008 302,000  4,262,5995,632,685 39,193,806   \nSep\u20132006  20,315,739 8,860,406 1,507,446 285,000  4,597,0085,936,603 41,502,202   \n     Source: Pakistan Telecommunications Authority. \n \n5.  To expand services in the rural areas, exploration of options for mobile money transfers \nusing  cell-phone  based  technology  can  play  an  important  role  as  earlier  discussed.  The \nintroduction  of  innovative  services  such  as  electronic  and  mobile  banking  to  leverage  the \nsubstantial reach of mobile phone services is now ripe for Pakistan. The telecom sector in \nPakistan has grown to a level where such services could be launched conveniently to benefit a \nlarge segment of the population currently hooked on to the mobile phone network. The Pakistan \nTelecommunications Authority (PTA) has reported a rapidly increasing subscriber base from \n306,493 in 2000 to over 36 million subscribers as of July 2006. The top firm accounts for 50% of \nmobile cellular subscribers, and the top two firm together account for 71% of total subscribers. \nDespite such concentrated market shares, the industry is considered as robust and competitive. \nMobilink, a subsidiary of Orascom Telecom, started operations in 1994 and is the largest \noperator in Pakistan. Mobilink was the first cellular service provider to operate on a 100% digital \n ", " 30  Appendix 1 \nGSM technology in Pakistan, and currently provides the widest network with coverage of 1000 \ncities, towns, and villages in Punjab, Sindh, Balochista, North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), \nCapital, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.4  Other operators services cover between 100- 500 \ncities each, two of the operators are subsidiaries of major European operators,5 and Warid Tel is \nbacked by the Abu Dhabi Group, one of the largest groups in the Middle East.6 \n \n6.  Deregulation in the telecom sector has supported the entry of new players and new \ntechnologies, along with higher service levels and lower prices for consumers throughout the \ncountry.  As part of the technological revolution in the telecom sector, PTCL will provide 2.1 \nmillion new wireless local loop (WLL) telephone connections in remote and rural areas of the \ncountry. The completion of the WLL facility is expected to take the phone coverage, presently \naround 30% in Pakistan to the level of 100%.7  Such access will support economic activity and \nboost ongoing productive activities in both the industrial and agriculture sectors. Farmers will \nhave better access to market information and markets for agriculture-produce, reducing the role \nof middlemen and increasing opportunities for better pricing to farmers. The rapid advancement \nof communication technology at affordable rates will be an important factor in reducing poverty, \nespecially in rural areas. The utilization of technology to also facilitate financial services to the \npoor and rural communities will also be key for improving access to financial services in this \ndecade.   \n7.  Mobile  banking  facility  is  in  place  in  many  developing  countries  consisting  of \ncomprehensive banking services including money transfer, cash-in, cash-out, person to person \ntransfer,  bill  payments,  on-line  purchases  etc.  Mobile  phone  banking  services  have  been \nsuccessfully  launched  in  various  countries,  including  the  Philippines,  where  it  offers  the \nconsumers a virtual wallet providing for a convenient way of transferring and remitting funds \nthrough SMS. The codes and messages exchanged in the process can then be converted to \ncash at widely deployed distribution channel locations and even retail outlets. Other developing \ncountries utilizing mobile phones to access bank accounts include the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, Bangladesh and India. In South Africa, 20-25% of people who have never had a bank \naccount  have  access  to  a  mobile  phone.  Through  a  partnership  between  a  bank  and  a \ntelecommunication company, it is now possible to use SMS to pay for goods, remit money, have \nsalaries deposited directly into cellular accounts, as well as deposit cash at Post Offices and \nsome  bank  branches.  This  service  is  being  promoted  extensively  in  townships  and  rural \ncommunities to help un-banked customers open accounts. Such product is planned to be \nexpanded to Botswana, Namibia, Zambia, and Malawi. In Kenya, through a partnership between \na telecom company, a commercial bank, a microfinance organization, and DFID (providing \nmatching  funding),  microfinance  clients  receive  a  mobile  phone  through  which  they  could \nelectronically make payments on their loans. In addition, customers are able to deposit or \nwithdraw  cash  from  authorized  agents,  make  person-to-person  money  transfers,  purchase \nairtime for re-sale or personal use, and receive accounts statements. Other options to get \nconnectivity  into  rural  areas  include  fixed  wireless  technology  (WiFi,  WiMax)  and  a  new \ngeneration of satellite networks (VSAT). These enable the transmission of voice traffic through \nthe internet. Such application has been applied in Viet Nam and Mongolia. \n                                                 \n4  Source: Mobilink company website: www.mobilinkgsm.com \n5  Instaphone (Pakcom Ltd) is a subsidiary of Millicom International Cellular (MIC) S.A., the Luxembourg-based \noperator of mobile properties.

Technology solutions, such as the internet and mobile phone, also hold considerable \npromise for increasing access to improved and less costly services for remittance senders and \nreceivers, including those in remote or underserved areas. The potential impact is vast for \nPakistan where workers remittances are estimated at more than $9 billion through formal and \ninformal channels. This is particularly so for Sri Lanka where migrant worker remittance is the \ncountry\u2019s highest foreign exchange earner. Nearly 60% of migrant worker remittance comes \nfrom rural Sri Lankan women who have been working abroad. A local bank has developed an \ninnovative e-product, the Money2Home remittance service, which transfers funds from any \ncountry to any designated account at any branch of the bank in real time, through the internet. \nThe transfer can take place if one is a member of the local bank\u2019s internet banking service, or by \nvisiting an appointed money agent where clients can obtain the same service for a nominal \ncompetitive rate. \n9.  In implementing these new payment innovations, conforming to the national banking \nregulatory  requirements  including  liquidity,  security,  fraud  detection  and  money  laundering \nprevention, is essential. The issues of fraud detection and money laundering can be managed \nby  tracking  deposit  and  withdrawal  transaction  value  and  patterns.  New  technological \nopportunities also allow the use of tangible objects such as voice, face or fingerprint recognition \nand a password for customer due diligence.    \n \nTable A1.5: Access to Financial Services \n \nNo. in Units  1999  2004  2005 \nNo. of banks  46  38  39 \nNo. branches per 10,000 adults  1.09  0.83  0.84 \nNo. of online branches  322 b  2,475  3,265 \nOnline branches per 10,000 adultsa  0.04b  0.29  .038\nNo. of ATMs  206 b  786  1,217 \nATMs per 10,000 adults  0.03 b  0.09  0.14 \nNo. of depositors  29,710,720  27,383,337  26,405,832 \nDeposit accounts per 10,000 adults  4,089  3,227  3,053 \nNo. of Borrowers  1,804,604 c  3,398,190  4,247,306 \nLoan Accounts per 10,000 adults  226 c  400  491 \n      Corporate Sector  14,256 c  19,333  19,881 \n      SME Sector  67,520 c  106,248  161,316 \n      Consumer  252,156 c  1,619,207  2,407,806 \n      Agriculture  1,339,961 c  1,534,502  1,534,502 \n      Commodity operations  1,458 c  3,207  6,730 \n      Others (including staff)  129,253 c  146,368  117,071 \nATM = automated teller machine, no. = number, SME = small and medium-sized enterprise.  \na 15 years and above. \nb\n  Figures for 2000 \nc \nFigures for 2002 \nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " 32  Appendix 1 \n \n \n \n \nTable A1.6: Size-Wise Distribution Depositors \n \nNo. in Units  1999  2004  2005 \nLess than PRs5,000\u2013   5,534,941  4,875,987  5,096,433 \nPRs5,000\u2013PRs10,000    8,738,366  3,023,093  2,430,554 \nPRs10,000\u2013PRs20,000  8,554,428  5,621,259  4,715,117 \nPRs20,000\u2013PRs30,000  2,558,148  3,437,734  2,776,385 \nPRs30,000\u2013PRs40,000  1,013,967  2,185,637  2,143,025 \nPRs40,000\u2013PRs50,000  613,459  1,618,331  1,579,817 \nPRs50,000 and above  2,697,511  6,621,296  7,664,501 \n  Total  29,710,720  27,383,337  26,405,832 \nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. \n \n \nTable A1.7: Islamic Banking Industry  \n(PRs billion) \n \n  Item  CY 03  CY 04  CY 05  15 Sep 06\nDeposits  8.4  30.2 50  63 \nTotal Assets  12.9  44.1 71  91 \nFinancing  8.6  27.5 46  51 \n         \nNo. of IBIs licensed  4  11  14  19 \nNo. of branches of IBIs       17  48  13  18 a \nlicensed  \nNo. of cities covered by IBIs  6  12  14  19 \nCY = calendar year, IBI = Islamic banking institutions, no. = number. \n a  Out of 18 IBIs licensed, 3 IBIs yet to start operations. \nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. \n ", "Appendix 2   33\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets/  Data Sources/  Assumptions and \nIndicators  Reporting  Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact       \nImproved household incomes  \u2022  Increased outreach and  \u2022  National  statistics  and  Assumptions \nand reduced poverty and  access of the poor to  economic reports from  \u2022  Political and \nvulnerability of the poor   sustainable financial  State Bank of Pakistan  macro-economic \n  services in rural and  (SBP);

The Government is keen to promote microfinance activities in the country on a fast track basis. \n \nPoverty reduction is an encompassing objective of Pakistan\u2019s Medium Term Development Framework (MTDF)   \n2005-10. The MTDF subsumes the Government\u2019s PRSP issued in 2003. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                      Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe Pakistan Economic Survey 2005\u20132006, released in June 2006, reports that the percentage of population living \nbelow the poverty line has fallen from 34.46% in 2001 to 23.9% in 2004\u20132005, a decline of 10.6 percentage points. \nThe percentage of population living below the poverty line in rural areas has declined from 39.26% to 28.10%while \nthose in urban areas, has declined from 22.69% to 14.9%. Rural poverty declined by 11.16 percentage points and \nurban poverty was reduced by 7.79 percentage points. \n \nA strong economic growth (7.5% average) for 3 years in a row, a large inflow of remittances (over $4 billion per \nannum) in recent years, and many other interventions contributed to the decline in poverty. Notwithstanding this \ndevelopment, the fact remains that around 36.45 million people in Pakistan still live below the poverty line. Further \nreduction in poverty is a major challenge for the Government. \n \nMicrofinance plays a critical role in improving the lives of the poor people. The poor use financial services not only for \nbusiness investment in their micro-enterprises but also to invest in health and education, to manage household \nemergencies, and to meet the wide variety of other liquidity needs that they encounter occasionally. Evidence from the \nmillions of microfinance clients around the world demonstrate that access to financial services enables poor people to \nincrease their household income, build assets and reduce their vulnerability to the crises that are so much a part of \ntheir daily lives. \n \nIn the context of Pakistan, the use of micro-credit holds importance for both the agricultural and non agricultural sector. \nThe need for credit is particularly important for poor farmers. Their requirement for agricultural inputs, seeds, fertilizer, \npesticide etc. tends to be cyclical as does their income. However the two cycles do not always coincide. Rural loans for \nnon agricultural purposes include such things as micro enterprises in unorganized sectors of rural economy. \n \nRealizing the importance of microfinance as a tool of poverty reduction and social mobilization, the Government is \naccelerating its efforts to establish strong foundations of microfinance in formal sector along with extending support to \nthe informal sector. \n \n ", "Appendix 7  69\nIn recent years the role of remittances in reducing poverty has been widely acknowledged. Remittances allow families \nto  maintain  or  increase  expenditure  on  basic  consumption,  housing,  education,  and  small-business  formation. \nRemittances constitute one of the largest sources of external finance for developing countries and Pakistan is no \nexception. Total remittances inflows since 2001-02 and until 2005-06 have amounted over $ 19 billion or Rs.1129 \nbillion. It has averaged 4.1%of GDP during the last four years. Such a massive inflow of remittances particularly \ntowards the rural or semi-urban areas of Pakistan must have helped loosen the budget constraints of their recipients, \nallowing them to increase consumption of both durables and non-durables, on human capital accumulation (through both \neducation and health care), and on real estate. To the extent that the poorer sections of society depend on remittances for \ntheir basis consumption needs, increased flow of remittances would be associated with reduction in poverty and \npossibly in equality. \n \nThe proposed Improving Access to Financial Services Program (the Program) aims to assist the Government to \nreduce poverty, build an inclusive financial sector, and promote sustainable economic growth. Policy, legal and \nregulatory reforms will be undertaken to support more rapid growth and outreach of financial services, including in rural \nand remote areas Among others, a National Strategy for Inclusive Financial Services will be developed that will \nincorporate all types of institutions including commercial banks, microfinance banks, rural support programs and other \nnon-government organizations. Development of savings services, insurance, lower cost money transfer and remittance \nservices,  and  products  and  services  that  are  shara  (Islamic  Law)  compliant  will  be  supported  to  provide  a \ncomprehensive range of financial services, not only credit. Adoption of new technology and applications for lowering \ncost of remittances will also be supported under the Program and innovation in service delivery to address the limited \nmobility of women, especially in rural areas. To achieve a large outreach in rural and remote areas, the Pakistan Post \nwill undertake strategic partnerships with microfinance banks and other financial institutions to provide loans and credit \nservices through the postal network of more than 12,267 post offices country wide. Strengthening the institutional \ncapacity of financial institutions will be undertaken including for microfinance banks, nongovernment organizations \ntransforming into microfinance banks, and commercial banks expanding services to meet the needs of the poor and \nlower income families. In addition to capacity building of financial institutions, enhancing the institutional capacity of \nauthorities including the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and provincial and local authorities will be undertaken. Training \nof SBP officers for implementation of new systems for on-site and off-site surveillance, and training for applications of \nnew technologies and systems for money transfer and remittances to lower cost of transfers are among key areas for \ncapacity building.   \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nDuring project preparation, extensive consultations were undertaken with various stakeholders, including Government \nofficials, microfinance banks, non-government organizations, and other funding agencies and donors. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nWomen in Pakistan generally have limited mobility. They cannot fully participate in economic activities that will help \ngenerate more incomes. Introducing mobile banking to the rural areas will enhance outreach, especially for women. \nExpansion of financial services through partnership between the Pakistan Post and microfinance banks and other \nfinancial institutions to rural areas will enhance access to financial services by women. \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Poverty Impact Analysis \n \n1.  During the program period, a number of benefits and impacts have been identified. \nThese  include  increased  outreach  of  financial  services  to  about  [2  million]  poor  and  rural \nhouseholds, product innovation and diversification at the micro-level allowing those left out of \nconventional micro-credit to benefit from Conventional and Islamic Finance services of savings, \nremittances and, once their debt borrowing capacity is strengthened, micro-loans for productive \nenterprises.  \n \n2.  The main focus of the project is also to allow greater accessibility of financial services to \nwomen. In order to support this, the project supports and encourages use of mobile and VSAT \ntechnology for greater financial services outreach and mobile banking operations. Applying \nthese technologies would significantly lower the transaction costs of reaching the women and \nincrease their participation in economic activity at the household level. To support women\u2019s role \nin wider economic development, a component dealing with literacy for women has been added. \nUnder this component, a national level literacy campaign will be conducted to support an \ninclusive financial sector, access of women to financial services, and expanded outreach of \nfinancial services in rural and remote areas. Evidence from Pakistan (and regional experience \nelsewhere) suggests that increasing women\u2019s\u2019 outreach to financial services has resulted in \nincrease  in  household  incomes,  food  consumption,  consumer  durables,  and  generation  of \n ", "Appendix 7  71\nfinancial assets, expenditure on children\u2019s education and health, especially girls education and \nover all improvement in social status. \n \n3.  The project supports central banks efforts for strengthening the institutional capacity of \nMicro-Finance  Banks,  Islamic  Banks,  Microfinance  Institutions,  NGO\u2019s  and  Rural  Support \nPrograms for expanding their existing services to meet the needs of poor through establishment \nof  a  dedicated  endowment  fund.  In  addition  to  building  capacity  of  financial  institutions, \nenhancing institutional capacity of SBP would also be given priority. Training of SBP officers for \nimplementation of new systems for systems for on-site and off-site surveillance, and training for \napplications of new technologies and systems for money transfer and remittances to lower cost \nof transfers are among key areas for capacity building. \n \n4.  Efforts will be made insofar as possible to capture the program impact from review of \nGovernment of Pakistan\u2019s ongoing research studies and surveys. These include Economic \nSurvey,  SBP  annual  reports  and  Banking  System  Review,  PSLM  Survey,  periodic  reports \nissued by Pakistan Microfinance Network depicting outreach, access and sector growth as well \nas periodic research carried out by various donors. Given the importance of this program for \nimproving  household  incomes,  promoting  economic  development  and  growth  and  reducing \nvulnerability of poor especially in rural and backward areas, proceeds from endowment fund \ncreated at the SBP will also be use to carry out program impact assessment during (before the \nrelease of second tranche) and 24 months after the release of second tranche.  \n \n ", " 72  Appendix 8 \nIMPROVING ACCESS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES FUND \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  One of the major impediments to growth, diversity and outreach in the financial sector is \nthe lack of capacity at the retail level in areas of product innovation and development, low level \nof understanding and application of technology for increasing outreach in remote and relatively \ninaccessible areas and weak understanding of government authorities in areas of microfinance \nand  its  impacts  in  poverty  reduction.

Financial service providers are defined as \nentities  providing  financial  services,  including  but  not  limited  to,  MFBs,  non-\ngovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  rural  support  programs  (RSPs),  Islamic \nbanks, leasing companies, and commercial banks. \n \n(iii)  Government and regulatory authorities to support development of an inclusive \nfinancial sector and implementation of measures under the Improving Access to \nFinancial Services Program (IAFSP). \n \n2.  Literacy Programs \n \n4.  Literacy programs to improve access to financial services by the poor will include the \nfollowing:  \n \n(i)  Literacy programs (financial and basic) conducted for clients and potential clients \nof financial service providers (as defined above in item 1(ii)). These service \nproviders may directly conduct literacy programs, or may sub-contract provision \n                                                 \n1  Prior funds established include the Microfinance Social Development Fund, Community Investment Fund, and Risk \nMitigation Fund established under the Microfinance Sector Development Program. \n ", "Appendix 8  73\nof the required services to conduct literacy programs.
