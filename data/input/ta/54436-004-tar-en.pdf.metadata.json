THE WOMEN\u2019S FINANCING MARKETPLACE \n \n1.  The REG: Technical Assistance for the Women\u2019s Financing Marketplace, approved in \nNovember 2020, will facilitate and broaden access to finance for women and women\u2019s businesses \nand communicate ADB\u2019s efforts in this area to encourage more lending to this sector. 1 Many \nfinancial institutions (FIs) in ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) have not targeted \nwomen borrowers and do not recognize the untapped commercial potential. 2 They do not provide \nsuitable and affordable products for this clientele and/or lack the awareness of the barriers that \nwomen or women\u2019s businesses encounter when trying to access financial services.3 The impacts \nof the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have reinforced the importance of a digital \neconomy to change business models and to integrate digital channels into how financial service \nproviders or businesses engage with customers. \n \n2.  During this period and post-COVID-19, a dedicated online platform can help support FIs \nand their existing and potential women borrowers. The Women\u2019s Financing Marketplace (the \nMarketplace) will, therefore, be innovative in its work and take a digital approach for interaction \nand  engagement.    Among  a  number  of  activities,  the  Marketplace  will:  (i)  aggregate  and \ndisseminate products on gender financing within ADB and to the broader external audience;  \n(ii)  support  the  identification  of  cutting-edge  technologies  for  FIs  to  achieve  operational \nefficiencies, reach and scale, and/or new product development to digitize business models, such \nas the use of alternative credit scoring models, mobile technology, cloud technology, and online \ndelivery channels, which are expected to be piloted in one or two countries (Papua New Guinea \n(PNG) has been identified as the first)), (iii) build capacity for FIs to promote gender responsive \nfinancial service delivery and women\u2019s businesses to improve viability, as needed, through a \nrange of digital toolkits, webinars and online support, (iv) establish linkages to other programs \nand initiatives on enabling access to finance for women, internal and external to ADB4; and  \n(v) create a community platform to attract other co-financiers, including potential TA funding \nproviders. The capacity building of FIs and women\u2019s businesses will be supported through the \ntechnical assistance (TA), Subproject 3. \n \n3.  The TA cluster is envisaged to have 4 Subprojects: (i) Design, Set up and Maintenance of \nthe Marketplace, (ii) Innovation and Technologies, (iii) Capacity Building, and (iv) Expansion of \nthe Marketplace. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n \n4.  This is the third subproject under the REG: Technical Assistance for the Women\u2019s \nFinancing Marketplace. The first and second subprojects were approved in November and \nDecember 2020, respectively, and consultants are being recruited. \n \nB.  Subproject Scope  \n \n \n1  Women\u2019s business in this context means micro-, small- and medium-sized women-owned or women-managed \nbusinesses. \n2  Financial institutions in this context are banks and non-bank financial institutions including microfinance institutions, \nhousing finance, and insurance companies, for instance. \n3  Barriers are for example limited financial literacy, insufficient credit history, and lack of collateral. \n4  For example, PSFI\u2019s Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee Program or ADB Ventures and SDCC\u2019s Gender \nand Development initiatives or Tech for Impact. \n ", "2 \n5.  The TA cluster has the following overall outcome: sustainable financial inclusion for \nwomen and women\u2019s businesses increased and has defined outputs to be delivered by each of \nthe four subprojects. Subproject 3 will specifically contribute to the TA cluster output 3: capacity \nbuilding to women and women\u2019s businesses in the first instance and to FIs after further funding is \nsecured.  \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs and Activities  \n \nOutput 1: Capacities of women\u2019s businesses and FIs increased. \n \n6.  Emerging evidence from COVID-19 suggests that in lower- and low-income countries, lost \nincome will result in an increase in relative poverty for informal workers and their families and that \ncompared to men\u2019s lives, women\u2019s economic and productive lives are disproportionately and \ndifferently affected.5 The hardest hit sectors include retail, trade and service industries such as \nstreet vending and domestic work- typically low-wage jobs that rely on in-person connections and \noften carried out by women.6 A survey on the impact of COVID-19 on women\u2019s businesses in \nPNG has for example found that 40.9% of smaller or semi-formal businesses have reported a \ntemporary halt in operations. 7 \n \n7.  While access to finance to adapt business models to the \u201cnew normal\u201d environment and \noperate more digitally is one challenge (such as e.g. using mobile payment channels, advertising \nthrough Facebook, selling through e-commerce platforms) that needs to be addressed, another \nchallenge is that often women\u2019s businesses do not have the financial literacy, skills and capacities \nto present bankable projects. Since the TA funds are earmarked for PNG, this subproject will \ntherefore support women\u2019s businesses in PNG through various means. Specifically, it will conduct \ntailormade training and coaching sessions, for example, in digital financial literacy, business \nplanning, and debt management and other areas, as needed, to sustainably develop their \nbusiness. A suitable training provider will be selected, and existing training curriculum and \nmaterial will be adjusted to meet the needs of the women\u2019s businesses and the new online format. \nProviding training and coaching sessions online in the current environment will reach a wider \naudience and can be screened across multiple countries and regions. It is expected that some \non-site coaching will remain, once the COVID-19 situation has improved. Further feedback from \nFIs on requirements for lending will also be incorporated.8 \n \n8.  Women\u2019s businesses will also be connected with networks (e.g. PNG Business Coalition \nof Women, Business Advocacy Network or Centre for International Private Enterprise) and \npotential accelerators that support women\u2019s businesses through tailor-made support and market \naccess possibilities and enhance sharing.9 Women\u2019s business initiatives in PNG are quite strong \nand will be excellent partners for the development of training and coaching, as well as to support \nnetworking activities. The first pilot activities for supporting women\u2019s businesses will be  financed \nby the Women Entrepreneur Financing Initiative (WeFi) under the Women Accelerating Vibrant \nEnterprises in Southeast Asia and the Pacific (WAVES) program.10 Material or courses prepared \n \n5  UN Women 2020, Policy Brief: The Impact of COVID-19 on Women, 9 April 2020. \n6  Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO), #3 Social Protection Responses to COVID-\n19, 2020. \n7  CIBE 2020.

Port Moresby \n8  It is envisaged that the training and coaching is coordinated with activities under REG TRTA: Technical Assistance \nfor Women\u2019s Financing Marketplace, subproject 2: Innovation and Technology in that this subproject include clients \nof FI under subproject 2.  \n9  Coaching and mentoring through accelerators will be facilitated through a separate TA. \n10  The Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative is a groundbreaking partnership that aims to unlock financing for \nwomen-led and women-owned businesses in developing countries. WeFi\u2019s partners include 14 donor governments, ", "3 \nunder this pilot can later be used for and knowledge gained can further inform the services under \nthe Marketplace.11 Networking for women\u2019s businesses and FIs can also be expanded through \nthe Marketplace. This work will be conducted in coordination with subproject 2, which focuses on \nthe digitization of business models. \n \n9.  Further, introducing new digital financial services, specifically geared to enhance gender \nresponsive financing or applying a gender lens in the investment/ credit or product development \nprocess of an FI will require different approaches and new skill sets. FIs will be supported through \na range of activities, such as specific tailored expert advice, webinars or online toolkits once \nadditional funding is secured.   \n \nD.  Subproject Cost and Financing \n10.  The TA subproject is estimated to cost $100,000, of which all will be financed on a grant \nbasis by WeFi under the WAVES program. The funds will support, among other activities, the \ndevelopment of online support through training, webinars, coaching and expert advice. It will cover \ndigital production, remuneration, travel, and per diem for international/national consultants and \nmiscellaneous expenses.  ADB will seek cost-matching from its client as much as possible. \n \nE.  Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n11.  ADB will administer Subproject 3 and its Private Sector Operations Department, Financial \nInstitutions  Division,  will  select,  supervise,  and  evaluate  consultants  in  collaboration  with \nTransaction Support Division and Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department, as \nnecessary.  \n \nTable 1: Subproject 3 Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative  2021-2023  \nimplementation period \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agencies  PSOD, PSFI \nKey Consultants (other  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nnecessary resources  Training Provider  Firm  ADB, Subproject 3 \nwill be identified in line \nwith further \nrequirements) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \nAdvance Contracting  Advance contracting will be considered to for early recruitment purposes.  \nNo contracts will be signed with consultants until subprojects have been \napproved. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \n12.
