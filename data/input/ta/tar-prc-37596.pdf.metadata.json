The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (the PRC) has requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide project preparatory technical assistance (TA) to help the \nNanning  municipal  government  (NMG)  prepare  the  Guangxi  Nanning  Urban  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Project. The Fact-Finding Mission visited the project area in April 2004; held \ndiscussions with staff of the NMG and other agencies concerned; and prepared the detailed \nobjectives,  scope,  costs,  and  implementation  and  financing  arrangements  for  the  project \npreparatory TA. The TA is listed in ADB's country program for 2004.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Nanning City is the political, economic, and cultural center of the Guangxi Zhuang \nAutonomous Region (GZAR). The total population of greater Nanning is 6.3 million. Nanning \nCity is 22,293 square kilometers (km2), including seven counties under its jurisdiction. The main \nurban area has five districts (Chengbei, Jiangnan, Xincheng, Xingning, and Yongxin) with a total \npopulation of 1.4 million. The city is ranked among the top 50 cities in the PRC in terms of \neconomic growth, which has risen particularly rapidly in recent years. However, the city\u2019s \ninfrastructure  facilities  lag  well  behind  its  built  environment,  severely  restricting  future \nsustainable development. City standards of river management, flood control, environment, water \nand soil conservation, and ecological system protection need to be improved.  \n \n3.   The Yongjiang River and its main tributaries, the Kelijiang and Xinxujiang rivers, run \nthrough the center of Nanning and impact significantly on urban mobility, water transport, and \ndaily life. However, the riparian areas are subject to severe flooding resulting from a lack of \nflood protection, and aging and substandard design and performance of flood protection dikes.2 \nThe city districts bordering the tributary rivers are served by a combined sewerage system \ndischarging into the rivers, which adds to the pollution of the river system. Further, domestic \ngarbage in Nanning is disposed of mainly in simple landfills. Problems resulting from limited \nsuitable sites, long haul distances, and the absence of adequate sorting and transfer stations \nare exacerbated by the rapid growth in the volume of garbage. Sorting and recycling facilities for \nresource recovery are few, and present practices harm people\u2019s health and the environment. \nThese problems require sustainable solutions. \n \n4.  Considerable effort has already gone into improving the situation: the NMG has invested \nheavily in the construction of flood banks along the north bank of the Yongjiang River through \nthe city, and several wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) are planned or under construction. \nThe Langdong WWTP phase I, financed by the Government of France, is the only city WWTP in \noperation.  It  was  commissioned  in  1999  and  provides  a  secondary  treatment  capacity  of \n100,000 cubic meters (m3)/day. Expansion of the plant\u2019s capacity by 100,000 m3/day is under \nplanning and will be financed by a loan from the Government of Japan. Another WWTP, offering \n240,000 m3/day of full secondary treatment, will be located at Jiangnan. The plant is being \nfinanced by the World Bank, and construction started in 2004. The World Bank-funded Guangxi \nUrban Environment Project is also under way. The project, covering Nanning and Guilin cities, \nincludes construction of WWTPs and environmental subprojects. It will improve the environment \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in the Internet edition of the ADB Business Opportunities on 12 March 2004.  \n2 The existing flood dikes were designed to control flood waters having a 2% annual probability of recurrence.  \n ", " 2   \nin Nanning and Guilin cities in support of sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty in \nthe region.3   \n \n5.   To improve further the people\u2019s living standard in Nanning and to reduce the threats of \nflooding and pollution, the NMG will now implement, within the frame of the city development \nplan,  additional  measures  for  river  upgrading,  sewerage  system  improvement,  ecological \nenhancement, and improvement of collection and disposal of domestic solid waste. The plan \ncalls  for  efficient  and  sustainable  urban  development  measures  based  on  appropriate \nstandards. Landscaped and green areas will also be developed to enhance the ecological and \nliving environment. \n \n6.  In support of this strategy, this TA will prepare a project proposal consisting of four \nsubprojects: (i) Kelijiang River environmental upgrading, (ii) Xinxujiang River environmental \nupgrading,  (iii)  Qingxiu  mountain  ecological  protection,  and  (iv)  city-wide  solid  waste \nmanagement. The Keilijiang River environmental upgrading component comprises the cleaning \nof the final 4.5 km length of the tributary, stabilization and general improvement of 17.3 km of \nbanks and flood-control structures, inclusion of riparian landscaping, separation of foul sewage \nfor piping to treatment from surface water drainage by laying 7.9 km of new sewers and \nsiphons, and provision of a pumped flushing facility for use during low flow in the tributary river. \nThe total area to be upgraded is 13.5 km2. The Xinxujiang River environmental upgrading \ncomponent comprises the cleaning of the final 6 km length of the tributary river, stabilization and \ngeneral improvement of the banks and flood-control structures (totaling 14 km), inclusion of \nriparian landscaping, separation of foul sewage for piping to treatment from surface water \ndrainage by constructing about 12.5 km of sewers, and, in association with the Kelijiang River \ncomponent,  provision  of  a  low-flow  flushing  facility.  The  total  area  to  be  upgraded  is \napproximately 12.5 km2. The Qingxiu mountain ecological protection component will control soil \nerosion, and stabilize and improve the right bank of the Yongjiang River to protect 3.3 km2. This \ncomponent also includes the construction of basic infrastructure and improvements to the \necological  system  in  an  area  totaling  16.1  km2.  The  city-wide  solid  waste  management \ncomponent aims to improve coverage and methods of street cleaning and solid waste collection, \nhandling, sorting, and transportation. The component will also reduce the volume of waste for \nsanitary landfill. The solid waste handling capacity will increase from the present 900 tons/day \n(t/d) to 1,200 t/d by 2010. \n \n7.  The Project will thus provide enhanced urban infrastructure, including improved levels of \nriver  management  and  flood  protection,  pollution  control,  urban  ecology,  and  solid  waste \nmanagement. The Project will bring down the high levels of flood risk and urban pollution, which \nresult in socioeconomic damage, and supports the NMG's infrastructure development program \nand efforts to reduce environmental pollution. The Project is consistent with the NMG\u2019s river \nimprovement, management, and flood control programs, and complements other internationally \nand locally funded river management and pollution control projects. The total cost of the \npossible project is estimated at about CNY2.48 billion ($300 million).  \n \n8.  ADB has been involved in urban development and water resource management in the \nPRC and helped to incorporate structural and nonstructural measures in the flood management \nstrategies of previous projects. The Yellow River and Songhua River Basin commissions have \n                                                 \n3 The World Bank\u2019s Guangxi Urban Environment Project has the following components: (i) sewerage and drainage in \nNanning, (ii) sewerage and solid waste management in Guilin, (iii) Lijian flow regulation, (iv) sugar refinery pollution \nabatement, and (v) institutional development.  ", "      3\nreceived ADB assistance to strengthen flood forecasting and warning systems.4 ADB\u2019s ongoing \nand planned projects are focusing on pollution control in Fujian, Hubei, Henan, and Shandong \nprovinces.  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  will  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s objectives in the urban, social, and water sectors. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The purpose of the TA is to prepare a project proposal to reduce the adverse economic, \nsocial, and environmental impacts of flooding, river pollution, riverbank erosion, and depletion of \nthe green environment in Nanning City. This will be done through improving local infrastructure, \nincluding riverbank stability; mitigating floods; isolating sources of pollution; and improving the \necological environment. The Project will also support the city\u2019s strategic plans for improving \ndomestic solid waste management. The main objective of the TA is to propose an investment \nproject suitable for ADB financing. The TA will help the NMG (i) review and identify the most \nappropriate  urban  infrastructure  developments  to  protect  vulnerable  areas;  (ii)  prepare  a \nfeasibility  study  for  each  of  the  four  subprojects;  and  (iii)  prepare  an  integrated  urban \ndevelopment project, including river management and flood control, enhancement of the green \nenvironment, water pollution control, and solid waste management, which will also include \nenvironmental impact assessments and resettlement plans consistent with ADB\u2019s policies and \nguidelines. The preliminary project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will be implemented in three phases. The first will undertake studies to (i) assess \nthe instability of riverbanks, risk of urban flooding within the project area, level of river pollution \nresulting  from  the  combined  sewerage  system,  extent  of  degradation  of  ecology  and \ninfrastructure  within  the  Qingxiu  ecological  protection  area  and  other  riparian  areas,  and \npossibilities for strengthening existing solid waste management; (ii) review the Government\u2019s \nflood and pollution management strategies, priorities, and investment plans within the NMG \nurban development and river management programs; (iii) strengthen the selection criteria and \nprioritize potential interventions based on these criteria, including economic, financial, social, \nenvironmental impacts and the urgency of mitigation needs; (iv) review the shortcomings in solid \nwaste collection, recycling, transport, treatment, and disposal; (v) review four feasibility study \nreports; and (vi) prepare an overall project feasibility study report.  \n \n11.  During the second phase, the TA will (i)  assess the completeness and adequacy of \nNanning\u2019s  existing  urban  development,  flood  management,  and  pollution  control  programs \nbased on technical, institutional, environmental, social, economic, financial, and other relevant \nfactors; (ii) formulate balanced urban development, flood management, and pollution control \nstrategies comprising structural and nonstructural measures; (iii) help formulate a strategic plan \nfor solid waste management and develop initiatives to support it; (iv)  update and undertake \nfeasibility studies of the four subprojects; and (v) help the NMG to prepare and/or strengthen its \ndraft  environmental  impact  assessment  and  resettlement  plans  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines and policies. During the third phase, the TA will help the NMG (i) formulate an overall \ninvestment project for ADB funding; (ii) consolidate feasibility study reports prepared during the \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001.
