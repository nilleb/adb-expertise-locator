INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2004 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) confirmed its request for technical \nassistance (TA) to improve road safety, optimize efficiency of road networks, strengthen traffic \nlaw enforcement, and maximize benefit for the community. The Fact-Finding Mission visited \nBeijing  in  March  2005,  and  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  TA \nobjectives,  scope,  and  implementation  arrangements.  The  TA1 is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  2005 \ncountry assistance program for the PRC. This paper is based on the Mission\u2019s findings and \nsubsequent discussions with the Global Road Safety Partnership (GRSP)2 to cofinance the TA. \nThe design and monitoring framework of the TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Road accidents are a human tragedy that result in health, environmental and social \nproblems, and have significant impacts on national economic growth strategies. In recognition \nof  this,  the  United  Nations  (UN)  has  recently  integrated  road  safety  into  its  policies  on \nsustainable development. In April 2004, for the first time, a UN General Assembly plenary \nsession  addressed  road  safety  and  called  on  member  states  to  stimulate  a  new  level  of \ncommitment and an urgent response to improve road safety. The World Health Organization \n(WHO) forecasts that road accidents will move from the ninth to the third most serious health \nproblem facing the world, within the next 10 years. The problem of road safety is acute in the \nAsia-Pacific region, which has only around 18% of the world\u2019s motorized vehicle fleet but \naccounts for around 50% of global road deaths. The estimated economic loss to the region from \nroad traffic accidents is over $35 billion per annum. Around 40 million in-patient days are taken \nup in the regions\u2019 hospitals each year with road accident victims.3 \n \n3.  In the PRC, rapid economic growth during the past decade, averaging around 10% per \nannum, has altered road transport demand, which has risen faster than that for other transport \nmodes, creating a huge demand for more road space. Given the PRC's rapid economic growth,  \nlow  vehicle  ownership  rates,  lower  car  prices  as  tariff  barriers  fell  after  World  Trade \nOrganization  (WTO)  accession,  and  increasing  access  to  loans  to  finance  automobile \npurchases, the vehicle fleet is expected to continue to grow rapidly in the coming years. \n \n4.  Rapid development and increasing vehicular growth in the PRC have resulted in a \nsubstantial increase in road accidents and loss of life. During 2000\u20132004, over 500,000 people \nwere killed and around 2.6 million injured in road accidents, equivalent to 1 fatality every  \n5 minutes\u2014the highest in the world.4 The situation will likely deteriorate unless urgent and \neffective action is taken to help the PRC make its roads safer. \n \n5.  The road subsector is the largest area in ADB's PRC operations, accounting for about \n60% of the portfolio, and roads are likely to remain a significant part of ADB's future program. \nADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  for  the  road  subsector  is  designed  to  remove  infrastructure \nconstraints and support policy and institutional reforms. ADB gives high priority to road safety in \n                                                           \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 4 February 2005. \n2  GRSP is a global partnership dedicated to reducing death and injury on the world\u2019s roads. Initiated by the World \nBank and United Nations in 1999, it is now a hosted program of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red \nCrescent Societies, based in Switzerland. On behalf of seven of its business members (Ford, General Motor, \nHonda, Michelin, Renault, Shell, and Toyota ), GRSP is implementing the Global Road Safety Initiatives (GRSI), \nand the PRC will be involved for the first time. This will be achieved by GRSP jointly funding this TA. \n3  WHO. 2004. World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention. Geneva. \n4  Studies reveal that road accidents, and the associated fatalities and injuries, in the PRC, are underreported by an \nestimated 42%. Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) Report 445. 2000. Estimating Global Road Fatalities. United \nKingdom. ", "2   \nits efforts to improve the way the road network is operated and used, help eliminate loss of lives, \nand promote poverty reduction and economic development. \n \n6.  The extent of adverse impacts of road accidents on the economy is characterized as \nfollows: \n \n(i)  Economic  losses  from  road  traffic  accidents  are  1\u20133%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) per annum (footnote 3)\u2014higher than the national budget \nfor  public  health  services,  and  the  national  budget  for  rural  compulsory \neducation. \n \n(ii)  In the PRC, road accidents disproportionately harm low-income groups (over \n60%) such as pedestrians, bicycle and motorcycle riders, and long-distance bus \nusers.5 When  household  heads  are  killed  or  disabled,  their  family\u2019s  poverty \nworsens.6 \n \n(iii)  Road  accident  costs  have  a  significant  adverse  impact  on  the  PRC \nGovernment\u2019s  fight  against  poverty,  and  on  the  scarce  medical  resources.  \nRoad injury patients represent over 25% of hospital bed occupancy (footnote 3).  \n \n(iv)  Increasing accidents create a burden on the scarce resources of road agencies \n(footnote 5). \n \n7.  Issues and constraints that contribute to road safety problems include the following: \n \n(i)  Lack of knowledge of basic traffic rules accounts for over 48% of all accidents. \nMany  of  these  accidents  involve  freight  vehicles  and  long-distance  buses \n(footnote 5). \n \n(ii)  Limited skills and resources of the driving license examiners. \n \n(iii)  Unavailability of a reliable accident investigation and data system, and in-depth \nresearch  needed  to  fully  understand  causes  and  create  effective \ncountermeasures. \n \n(iv)  Road safety management practices are characterized by a lack of overall goal-\norientation  and  performance  evaluation,  fragmented  safety  interventions,  and \nlimited road safety expertise, resources, and interagency coordination between \nthe different agencies that are responsible for different parts of the road network \n(footnote 5). \n \n8.  To address these constraints, ADB has previously provided an advisory TA (footnote 5) to \nhelp the Ministry of Public Security (MPS), which is the lead road safety agency in the PRC. \nThis TA developed a focused, interagency, and multidimensional program\u2014the National Road \nSafety  Reform  Program (NRSRP)\u2014to address various road safety problems. The TA was \nassessed as highly successful. \n \n9.  The NRSRP has identified major road safety obstacles, characteristics of the problem, \nrole of each agency, and included ten key components to address various road safety problems \n                                                           \n5  ADB. 1999.

The Government and MPS are highly committed to implement the NRSRP. They have \nimplemented two key components of the NRSRP, namely (i) establishment of the first national \ninteragency road safety committee in September 2003 to enhance coordination and optimize \nthe use of resources, under the leadership of the MPS and with the membership of 17 key \nministries,  including  the  Ministries  of  Communications,  Construction,  Health,  Education, \nFinance, and Agriculture; and (ii) introduction of the first comprehensive road and traffic safety \nlaw in May 2004. However, more work is required to achieve the objectives of the NRSRP. \n \n11.  The Fact-Finding Mission and MPS assessed the conditions of, and impediments to \nimproving, road safety and how best to move forward in addressing road safety issues. It was \nconcluded  that  MPS  should  be  proactive  in  making  roads  safer  through  advancing  the \nimplementation of the remaining components of the NRSRP. ADB coordinates with the World \nBank, private sector, WHO, and other donors to optimize road safety projects and share policy \ninformation. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The TA aims to improve the safety and efficiency of road transport operations, and \nstrengthen traffic law enforcement in the PRC,8 which will benefit low-income groups, and \nincrease overall economic benefits from road network investments. The TA will (i) implement    \nNRSRP components through policy and institutional reforms in a \u201cmodel province\u201d to show the \nbenefit of road safety improvement; (ii) formulate a monitorable action plan to replicate the \ninitiatives of the \u201cmodel province\u201d in other provinces and to advance national implementation of \nthe NRSRP; and (iii) develop a road safety investment plan. \n \n13.  The TA will help reduce the severity, frequency, and cost of road accidents to the \ncommunity. The TA will complement the programs of the Government and ADB in strategically \nfocused areas, help MPS in its leadership role, and enhance the capacity of road and traffic \nagencies. International expertise and best-practice exposure are crucial to the success of road \nsafety  programs  in  the  PRC.  The  selected  TA  components  are  designed  to  provide  this. \nThe GRSP cofinancing for the TA represents a significant step forward as it will be the first time \nthat the private sector will be involved in road safety in PRC. The MPS is highly committed to \nimplement the TA under guidance of a Vice Minister. \n \n14.  The TA will support the following: \n \n                                                           \n7  The key components of the NRSRP include: (i) establish national and provincial road safety councils to improve \ninteragency cooperation and provide leadership to optimize the use of resources; (ii) adopt new legislation to \nmaintain law and order on the road network; (iii) develop sustainable transport planning, traffic management, traffic \nlaw enforcement, and travel demand management systems; (iv) increase the capability of relevant agencies and \ntheir staff and advance community awareness; (v) develop a more safety-conscious road design approach;  \n(vi) develop accident investigation and accident data systems that will permit the scale, nature, and characteristics \nof accidents to be accurately defined, and remedial measures; (vii) improve driver training and testing systems to \nminimize abuse in licensing practices; (viii) improve vehicle testing and the inspection system to deter the use of \ndefective and unsafe vehicles on public roads; (ix) integrate the emergency service system to enhance services \nand rescue assistance for traffic accident victims; and (x) apply for donors\u2019 support to make up for the shortage of \nfunds, resources, and skills.  \n8  Road safety improvements will save far more money than they cost. Low cost engineering improvements at \ndangerous road accident blackspots can give economic rates of return in excess of 100-200% (footnote 3). \n   ", "4   \n(i)  Policy  and  institutional  reforms  in  a  model  province.  Implement  NRSRP \ncomponents in a \u201cmodel province\u201d9 to show the benefit of improved road safety and \nsystem  efficiency,  and  to  facilitate  national  implementation,  including  \n(a)  establish  interagency  road  safety  council,  comprising  Provincial \nCommunications Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and relevant agencies in the \nareas  of  education,  emergency  services,  health  care,  construction,  planning, \nagriculture, and environment; (b) develop necessary policy and institutional reforms \nto facilitate implementation of the road and traffic safety law; (c) promote capacity \nbuilding,  and  human  resources  development,  and  community  awareness \ncampaign; (d) develop a more safety-conscious road design approach; (e) develop \nintegrated  traffic  management  systems  that  take  account  of  non-motorized \ntransport issues; (f) improve accident investigation and data systems account;  \n(g) improve driver license testing, and vehicle inspection systems; and (h) develop \ntargeted traffic enforcement measures. \n \n(ii)  National action plan. To advance implementation of the NRSRP at the national \nlevel, formulate a monitorable action plan to replicate the initiatives of the \u201cmodel \nprovince\u201d in other provinces. The action plan will (a) identify directions for changes, \npriorities, and monitoring requirements; and (b) address issues of administration, \nstaffing,  and  interagency  coordination,  and  the  optimization  of  the  use  of \nresources. \n \n(iii)  Road safety investment plan. Develop an investment plan, in accordance with \nthe NRSRP recommendations, to address the shortage of resources, and skills, \nand ensure sustainable road safety improvement. The plan will identify urgent \nresource and skills needs, and investment solutions to meet these needs. The plan \nwill be assessed by the Government during TA implementation, and could form the \nbasis of a pilot project in a selected province. The plan will address possible \nsources of road safety funding including budgetary allocations, road user charges, \nenforcement fines, and multilateral development bank financing. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will be implemented in three parts: (i) support for policy and institutional reforms \nin a \u201cmodel province\u201d in which NRSRP components will be implemented through demonstration \nprojects; (ii) formulation of a monitorable action plan to replicate the initiatives of the \u201cmodel \nprovince\u201d to other provinces and to advance implementation of the NRSRP at national level; and \n(iii) development of a road safety investment plan. The MPS will establish a steering committee, \nand counterpart team, to ensure effective implementation. Endorsement of the TA outputs by \nMPS will be essential for high-level commitment to their effective implementation. Promotion \nmaterials will be produced to help disseminate the output of the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total TA cost is estimated at $1,500,000 equivalent, comprising $960,000 in foreign \nexchange and $540,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will provide $400,000 equivalent on a \ngrant basis from its TA funding program. The GRSP will provide a grant of $225,000 equivalent \nto be administered by ADB, during 2006\u20132008. The GRSP will contribute $375,000 equivalent \non a parallel grant basis, for use under ADB guidance, to facilitate the implementation of the TA \naction plan and monitoring, during 2006\u20132008 ($272,000 in foreign exchange and $103,000 in \nlocal  currency).  MPS  will  provide  the  remaining  $500,000  equivalent,  in  foreign  currency \n                                                           \n9  Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi), which is one of the three least developed areas in the PRC, has \nbeen selected as a \u201cmodel province\u201d. \n ", "  5\n($200,000)  and  local  currency  ($300,000)  for  training,  workshops,  counterpart  staff,  office \nfacilities,  local  transport,  and  other  facilities  and  services  required  to  implement  the  TA.  \nThe detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  Consulting services of 54 person-months (25 international and 29 domestic) will be \nprocured by hiring individual consultants, because of the specialized nature of the assignment, \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants, and in consultation with MPS. \nThe international consultants team will consist of (i) a road safety strategy expert, as a team \nleader, and in charge of the \u201cmodel province\u201d program, action plan, and the proposed road \nsafety investment plan (17 person-months); (ii) a safer road expert, in charge of the road design \nrelated matters (4 person-months); and (iii) a safer traffic expert, in charge of the traffic and \ndriver behavior related matters (4 person-months). The experts will be supported by domestic \nconsultants (Appendix 3). \n \n18.  The  Traffic  Management  Bureau  (TMB)  of  MPS  will  be  the  Executing  Agency, \nresponsible for supervision and monitoring of TA activities. The Traffic Management Research \nInstitute (TMRI)10 of TMB will be the TA implementing agency. \n \n19.  The  TA  will  start  in  January  2006  and  be  completed  in  October  2008.  The  first  \n12 months will be for (i) starting the \u201cmodel province\u201d program; (ii) developing an action plan to \nfacilitate  national  implementation;  and  (iii)  preparing  the  road  safety  investment  plan \nrequirements.  Years  2  and  3  will  be  used  to  (i)  assess  the  \u201cmodel  province\u201d  program;  \n(ii) assist in implementation of the NRSRP at national level; (iii) assist in further development of \nthe road safety investment plan and its monitoring. ADB and GRSP will sign an agreement to \nfacilitate  administration  of  the  GRSP\u2019s  fund  by  ADB.  An  advance  payment  facility  will  be \nestablished for the training, study, survey, equipment, and \u201cmodel province\u201d components of the \nTA. TMB will provide counterpart support services to the consultants. All equipment will be \nprocured under the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, and ownership \nwill be transferred to the TMB after the TA. Tripartite meetings involving the Government, ADB \nstaff members, and consultants will be held to guide the consultants. GRSP will be invited to \nprovide feedback. An inception report will be produced after the fielding of the international \nconsultants, and a report will be produced after each TA activity. TMB will submit a brief monthly \nmonitoring report, while the final TA report will be submitted by October 2008, after receipt of \nADB comments. TMB will provide an annual monitoring report for 3 years after TA.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n20.
