THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  Kyrgyz Republic is a country at high risk of impact from the adverse effects of climate \nchange and extreme weather events. The proposed project will strengthen the resilience of the \nwater resources sector to floods, landslides, and droughts through structural and non-structural \ninterventions. The project will comprise four outputs: (i) irrigation infrastructure modernized; (ii) \ndisaster-resilient agricultural and land management practices introduced; (iii) flood protection \ninfrastructure modernized; and (iv) disaster risk and water resources data collection and analysis \nimproved. The project outcome will be climate change and disaster resilience of infrastructure \nand water security improved. The project will be aligned with the following impacts: (i) population \nand territories protected from emergencies; threats, risks, and hazards forecasted;1 and (ii) \nprevent climate change related damage and losses in the country.2 \n \n2.  The project is estimated to cost $30 million. ADB will finance $25 million comprising a \n$15 million concessional ordinary capital resources loan and a $10 million Asian Development \nFund grant under the disaster risk reduction (DRR) financing mechanism.3 The government will \nfinance exemptions of taxes and duties for imported goods, works, and services, initially estimated \nat $5 million.
