The  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  biodiversity  conservation  corridors  (BCC) \ninitiative is to support the broad-based agenda of sustainable development identified by the \nGMS countries and incorporated in the Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program 2004\u20132008 \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 ADB\u2019s strategy and program aim to address GMS \ndevelopment  challenges  and  support  the  countries\u2019  strategic  objectives  by  enhancing \nconnectivity and competitiveness, and developing a greater sense of community in the region. \nRegional  economic  corridors  are  expected  to  play  a  crucial  role  in  helping  deliver  this \ndevelopment agenda. But concern is growing that increasing development needs and economic \ncorridors may result in the fragmentation of natural landscapes. This would undermine the \nfunctioning  and  performance  of  the  region\u2019s  ecosystems,  thereby  threatening  long-term \nsocioeconomic and environmental security of the region.  \n \n2.  Recognizing this development challenge, the BCC initiative was considered by the First \nTask Force Meeting for the Preparation of the Second GMS Summit held in Beijing, People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) in July 2004.2 The task force members agreed in principle to pursue \nthe proposal in consultation with relevant line ministries. Accordingly, the Working Group on \nEnvironment meeting held in September 2004 in Viet Nam considered and endorsed the BCC \ninitiative. As secretariat for the GMS, ADB will provide technical assistance (TA) to the GMS \ncountries for undertaking the initiative. The TA approach, objectives, scope and outputs were \nfinalized in consultation with the relevant line ministry staff and other development partners \nduring  the  Working  Group  on  Environment  meeting.  These  were  confirmed  during  the \nconsultation mission undertaken by ADB.3  Consultations were held with other development \npartners including the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), World Conservation \nUnion (IUCN), and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The general consensus reached was \nthat this initiative will strengthen the region\u2019s commitment to, and capacity for, sustainable \ndevelopment. The governments support the TA approach, objectives, scope and outputs. The \nTA framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  GMS  countries\u2019  Strategic  Development  Framework,  adopted  in  2001,  guides \ndevelopment cooperation until 2011.5 Over the last decade, investments of $2 billion were \ncommitted in the energy and transport sectors alone. A more ambitious level of investment ($10 \nbillion at a minimum) is envisaged for the next 10 years. This will induce significant economic \nand  social  changes  in  the  subregion.  Countries  will  be  increasingly  linked  through \ntransportation,  telecommunications,  energy  production  and  usage,  and  cross-border  trade. \nGross domestic product per capita in the subregion is expected to double by 2015, by which \ntime  the  population  will  have  increased  by  40  million.  Economies  will  undergo  structural \n                                                 \n1  The GMS includes Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Yunnan \nProvince in People\u2019s Republic of China. \n2  The task force comprises GMS government officials responsible for the planning and organization of the Second \nGMS Summit to be held in  PRC in July 2005. \n3  The mission led by Javed H. Mir, Sr. Natural Resources Specialist, MKAE, visited PRC (22 November 2004); \nCambodia (24 November 2004); Viet Nam (26-29 November 2004); Thailand (30 November \u20132 December 2004); \nand Lao PDR (6 December 2004). \n4  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 14 October 2004.  \n5  The framework guides development cooperation in five major areas:(i) strengthen infrastructure linkages using a \nmultisector approach, (ii) facilitate cross-border trade and investment, (iii) enhance private sector participation and \nimprove its competitiveness, (iv) develop human resource skills and competencies, and (v) protect the environment \nand promote sustainable use of shared natural resources. \n ", "2  \nchanges: the manufacturing and service sectors will expand; while agriculture will become more \ndiverse, intensive, and productive. These developments will inevitably impact the environment. \nIn the absence of proactive and effective environmental management, future development \nefforts will be undermined with potential for increased environmental degradation. Accordingly, \nthe Strategic Environment Framework (SEF) was formulated as an integral component of \nStrategic  Development  Framework.  The  SEF  aims  to  protect  environmental  resources  as \nfundamental prerequisites to sustainable development in the GMS. The proposed BCC initiative \nis seen by the GMS countries as a proactive strategy to accelerate SEF implementation.  \n \n4.  BCC have gained currency as countries find that their existing protected areas, which \nare the main strategy for meeting their biodiversity conservation needs and obligations under \nthe Convention on Biological Diversity, are unlikely to deliver the desired results on their own. \nExisting  protected  areas  are   small  and  are  being  reduced  to  islands  within  a  cultivated \nlandscape that is under increasing development pressure and fragmentation. Consequently, \nprotected areas are unlikely to be able to protect viable populations of wide-ranging species or \nhigh-value ecosystems. The options in the GMS for addressing ecosystem fragmentation will \nbecome more limited, as attempts to enlarge protected areas is constrained by increasing \npressures on land for other uses.  \n \n5.  Ecosystem fragmentation is increasingly being associated with transport and economic \ncorridors. For example, the Tumen River Strategic Action Program in the PRC recognizes that \ntransport  corridors  are  the  drivers  for  economic  development  in  the  region  of  the  PRC, \nDemocratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Mongolia, and Russian Federation. But these corridors \nare also likely to exert additional impacts on biodiversity. Thus greening of the infrastructure and \neconomic corridors is considered essential\u2014one means is the establishment of BCC. \n \n6.  BCC  are  designed  to  ensure  the  long-term  conservation  of  high-value  ecological \nprocesses, biodiversity, and threatened species; as well as contribute to social and economic \ndevelopment by combining these with ecological and/or cultural tourism. To a certain extent \nBCC are analogous to the economic corridors in their functionality and objectives, i.e., both \nattempt to increase the system connectivity, economies of scale, integration, and efficiency. \nBCC do the latter by increasing the functional boundaries of the protected areas. BCC allow the \nunhindered movement of species, and gains in scale efficiencies that are needed to sustain \necological processes that underpin sustainable development.  \n \n7.  By increasing connectivity between national and transboundary terrestrial, aquatic, and \nmarine ecosystems, in particular high-value protected areas, BCC will prevent and mitigate \nhabitat fragmentation. In the absence of such corridors, ecological and environmental services \nof importance to the GMS development agenda are likely to be threatened.  \n \n8.  BCC can also act as insurance against the potential negative impacts of climate change. \nAs climate change triggers changes in local temperature and moisture levels, BCC will act as \nsafety valves by providing habitat for plant and animal species that will have to move along the \nclimate gradient. This has implications for conservation of agro-biodiversity and long-term food \nsecurity of the GMS countries. \n9.  Several  sequential  efforts  have  identified  and  delineated  important  biodiversity \nconservation areas in the GMS. BirdLife International has identified several important bird areas \nin the region; WWF and IUCN identified several centers of plant diversity; WWF and Wildlife \nConservation  Society identified a series  of  prioritized  tiger  conservation  units,  and  WWF \nidentified ecoregions across the Indo-Pacific region including in the GMS that are under threat \n ", "  3\nfrom  landscape  and  habitat  fragmentation.  In  2002,  the  Stockholm  Environment  Institute \ndeveloped  (for  ADB)  the  Strategic  Environmental  Framework  for  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion. This analysis assessed the impacts of ADB\u2019s planned regional developments on \nbiodiversity and the environment. The framework identified a series of hot spots, broadly defined \nas areas of high biodiversity conservation value that will be impacted by regional development \nplans. \n10.  In 2004, the Critical Ecosystems Partnership Fund formulated an ecosystem profile for \nthe Indochina Region of the Indo-Burma hot spot.6 The TA will build upon these and other \ninitiatives and ADB\u2019s experience. In the Asia and Pacific region, BCC are under design and/or \nimplementation in Bhutan, Philippines, Viet Nam, and Yunnan Province of the PRC. Under the \nproposed ADB Forests for Livelihood Improvement Project in Viet Nam, BCC are identified as \nthe means to enhance the biodiversity conservation potential and function of protection forests \nin the Central Highlands of Viet Nam.   \n \n11.   BCC  are  of  relevance  and  importance  to  GMS  countries,  as  both  sustainable \ndevelopment and competitiveness of GMS member countries will to a large extent depend upon \nthe efficiency and effectiveness with which their natural resource endowments are protected \nand maintained. Without this, the direct and indirect costs of environmental degradation could \nundermine the region\u2019s development performance. The TA will assist the countries in reconciling \nand enhancing the development and environmental protection function and performance of their \ndevelopment plans and investments. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The purpose is to prepare a GMS BCC development strategic framework (2005\u20132014) \nand action plan (2005\u20132008). The strategic framework will (i) identify and prioritize terrestrial \nBCC  of  strategic  importance  from  a  biodiversity  conservation  as  well  as  development \nperspective, (ii) review and analyze conservation and economic development policies that need \nto  be  rationalized  and  harmonized  among  GMS  countries  for  effective  and  sustainable \nfunctioning of BCC, and (iii) identify an enabling governance and management arrangement for \nimplementation of the 2005\u20132008 BCC action plan. \n \n13.  The TA components will include (i) threat analysis of high-value terrestrial biodiversity \nconservation areas and protected areas with specific reference to GMS  economic corridors \n(GMSECs) and BCC potential and establishment options, (ii) assessment of conservation and \ndevelopment policy coherence/incoherence for BCC development, and (iii) institutional and \nmanagement options analyses. \n \n14.  The Second GMS Summit is expected to include a declaration endorsing the BCC \ninitiative. Specific outputs will include (i) a BCC needs assessment report, (ii) a BCC feasibility \nassessment report, (iii) a GMS 2005\u20132014 development strategic framework and 2005\u20132008 \nBCC action plan, and (iv) a draft GMS Summit declaration. The framework will (i) provide an \nintegrated  biodiversity  conservation  and  development  strategy  and  action  plan  that  will \nsafeguard and improve livelihoods of people living in or near BCC and/or economic corridors; \n                                                 \n6  Critical Ecosystems Partnership Fund. 2004.

Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will adopt a multistakeholder participatory diagnosis and design approach for its \nimplementation using geographic information system (GIS) and field surveys. Key activities will \ninclude (i) identify high-value terrestrial ecosystems in the GMS; (ii) undertake threat analysis in \nterms of ecosystem and species habitat fragmentation with specific reference to the GMSECs; \n(iii) identify priority BCC to prevent and mitigate landscape and habitat fragmentation in the \nGMS with particular focus on GMSECs; (iv) identify conservation and development policy and \nplan rationalization and harmonization needs; (v) prepare a GMS BCC development strategic \nframework (2005\u20132014) and action plan (2005\u20132008), including cost estimates for implementing \nthe  2005\u20132008  action  plan,  and  indicative  cost  estimates  and  financing  strategy  for \nimplementing the strategic framework; and (vi) undertake institutional option analyses, and \nidentify appropriate implementation arrangements for implementing the action plan and meeting \ncapacity-building needs. \n \n16.  The TA will also identify the enabling policy and institutional framework for effective and \nefficient planning, establishment, and management of the priority BCC in the GMS. Moreover, \ndata and information needs, availability, sources, and sharing mechanisms for supporting BCC \nestablishment and management will be identified.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $400,000 \nequivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. UNEP will finance (in kind) $60,000 equivalent, and the concerned GMS \ngovernments  will  finance  (in  kind)  $40,000  equivalent.  Detailed  cost  estimates  are  in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB\u2019s will be the Executing Agency for the TA. In addition to partner line agencies from \nGMS countries, the TA will be implemented in coordination with UNEP, WWF, IUCN, and other \nenvironmental nongovernment organizations, and universities and research institutions that are \nactive in the GMS. The partner line agencies will (i) facilitate on-site data collection and \nconsultants\u2019 field work, and provide data and information on protected area development plans; \nand (ii) help develop and implement action plans for the priority BCC. UNEP will provide GIS \ndata  and  information  and  analyses  expertise,  and  facilitate  interagency  discussions  and \ncooperation. WWF and IUCN will provide technical expertise on regional conservation and \nprotected area system development and management. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented in two phases over 8 months. Phase 1, from December \n2004 to January 2005, will focus on the needs assessment. This will involve identifying high-\nvalue  terrestrial  biodiversity  corridors  to  prevent  and  mitigate  landscape  and  habitat \nfragmentation in the GMSECs, developing GIS data and overlay maps showing existing or \nplanned corridor initiatives in the GMS economic corridors, identifying ongoing and planned \nmajor road and transport infrastructure plans of relevance to the initiative, and identifying current \nconservation plans.  Phase II, from March to July 2005, will focus on preparing the strategic \n ", "  5\nframework  and  action  plan.  This  will  involve  identifying  high  priority  BCC for the GMS; \nidentifying policy, institutional, and technical frameworks for BCC planning and establishment; \nundertaking  harmonizing  and  rationalizing  of  conservation  and  development  plans  for  the \npriority BCC; and undertaking a participatory design approach to preparing the 2005\u20132014 \nstrategic framework and 2005\u20132008 action plan.  \n \n20.  For TA implementation, ADB will recruit a team of international and domestic consultants \non  an  individual  basis.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. A total of 19 person-months of consulting services will be \nrequired:  9  person-months  international  and  10  person-months  domestic.  The  required \nexpertise and outline terms of reference are provided in Appendix 3. All equipment will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement.7 At least two stakeholder \nworkshops will be organized to secure stakeholder input. The following reports will be produced: \n(i) an inception report by the end of 4 weeks of consultant mobilization, (ii) an interim report by \nthe end of 12 weeks, (iii) a draft final report by the end of 20 weeks, and (iv) a final report by the \nend of 24 weeks (after incorporating comments on the draft final report). The final report will \ninclude the GMS BCC development strategic framework (2005\u20132014) and action plan (2005\u2013\n2008). TA implementation will be monitored through the (i) inception, interim, and final workshop \nreports; (ii) participation in stakeholder workshops; (iii) and at least two review missions.  \n \nIV.
