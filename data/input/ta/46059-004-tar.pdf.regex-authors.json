INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) aims to support the Government of the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) in (i) implementing budget reforms with a focus on \nmedium-term budgeting, (ii) adopting and implementing formula-based intergovernment fiscal \ntransfers, and (iii) strengthening the role of the National Assembly in fulfilling its oversight \nfunctions through policy advice and technical support.1 The TA is aligned with the country \noperations business plan for the Lao PDR, 2015\u20132017 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nwhich  identifies  public  sector  management  reforms  and  capacity  development  as  a  key \ncrosscutting theme under ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the Lao PDR, 2012\u20132016.2 \nADB conducted a fact-finding mission on 13\u201319 August 2015, during which agreement was \nreached  with  the  government  on  the  TA  project\u2019s  objectives,  scope,  implementation \narrangements, and financing plan. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Development challenges. The Lao PDR has experienced robust economic growth from \n2005\u20132014, averaging 8% of gross domestic product annually. Growth has been driven by an \nunprecedented resources boom and been boosted by large-scale foreign direct investments in \nhydropower and mining, accounting for about one-third of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. \nAs a result of this sustained growth, the country has witnessed a significant reduction in the \npoverty rate, from 27.6% in 2007\u20132008 to 23.2% in 2012\u20132013. While overall poverty has \ndeclined, the country is faced by a number of structural and policy challenges. The Lao PDR\u2019s \ninequality gap (as measured by the Gini coefficient) is expanding to 36.17 in 2013, especially \nbetween the urban population and the bulk of the country\u2019s rural population. The country is not \non track to meet a number of its Millennium Development Goals, including reducing the rates of \nchild mortality and increasing school enrollments. In addition, the country\u2019s infrastructure needs, \nespecially in rural areas, remain unmet, and rural poor people have limited access to basic \nservices.  The  government  recognizes  these  challenges  and  is  focusing  on  broad-based, \nsustainable, and inclusive growth for poverty alleviation in its development agenda, articulated \nin successive national socioeconomic development plans (NSEDPs). \n \n3.  Binding  constraints. In  the  Lao  PDR,  significant  resource  constraints  and  lack  of \ncapacity of government agencies undermine the effectiveness of public sector management, at \nboth the central and subnational levels. Public financial management (PFM) is  weak. The \nabsence of a medium-term fiscal strategy continues to undermine budget predictability and \nlimits the strategic allocation of resources. Despite recent progress, resource inadequacy is \nacutely experienced at the subnational level, which is mandated to deliver key education and \nhealth  services.  Further,  intergovernment  fiscal  arrangements  continue  to  be  challenging. \nCurrently,  provincial  budgets  are  determined  by  ad  hoc  negotiations  between  central \ngovernment  and  the  provinces.  More  transparent  and  technically  sound  budget  allocation \nmechanisms  are  needed  to  strengthen  the  predictability  of  provincial  budgets,  to  enable \nimproved service delivery, especially for the poor. Legislative scrutiny of the government budget \nlacks substance, and the National Assembly approves only broad expenditure allocations and a \nline item budget that provides little information on the purpose of spending. Overall, these \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 September 2015.  \n2  ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, 2015\u20132017.  \n3  ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Programmatic \nApproach, Policy-Based Loan and Grant, and Grant Assistance for Subprogram 1 to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic for the Governance and Capacity Development in Public Sector Management Program. Manila (Grant \n0309-LAO). \n ", "2 \nweaknesses in PFM entail high costs in terms of allocative and operational efficiency in the Lao \nPDR. \n \n4.  Government reform agenda. The government is aware of the centrality of PFM reforms \nto the national efforts toward poverty reduction. Implementation of the 2005 PFM strengthening \nprogram helped the government revamp the legislative framework governing public finances \nthrough enacting the revised Budget Law (2006) and the Audit Law (2007); establishing a \nNational  Treasury  and  strengthening  Treasury  controls;  and  improving  revenue  policy  and \nadministration (through the introduction of a value-added tax). The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is \ncurrently finalizing a long-term public finance development strategy for the period to 2020 and a \nvision  document  for  the  period  to  2030  aimed  at  linking  policy,  planning,  and  budgeting \nefficiently. The revised Budget Law is currently under revision and is expected to be submitted \nto the National Assembly in December 2015. The MOF is putting greater emphasis on having in \nplace a multiyear perspective on expenditure policy and budgeting to strengthen the overall \nallocative efficiency with regard to PFM institutions and processes in the Lao PDR. \n \n5.  Improving  transparency  in  intergovernment  fiscal  relations  is  high  on  the \ngovernment\u2019s policy agenda. The Sam Sang initiative has been driving this policy agenda \nsince 2012. The Sam Sang vision is to delegate a range of authority and responsibilities from \ncentral  ministries  to  province,  district  and  village  levels  to  enable  local  socio-economic \ndevelopment  and  eradicate  poverty.  Initially  implemented  as  a  pilot,  Sam  Sang  seeks  to \nstrengthen districts and villages as primary agencies for service delivery and has evolved from a \npilot  to  a  comprehensive  state  policy,  the  implementation  of  which  requires  key  reforms. \nLessons from the pilot implementation have underscored the urgency to adopt objective criteria \n(i.e., expenditure norms) to establish resource needs at subnational levels. The revised Budget \nLaw is expected to strengthen the legal basis and pave the way for formula-based budgetary \ntransfer arrangements among different levels of government, to redistribute resources for more \nequitable distribution, based on transparent and technically sound norms.  \n \n6.  Enhancing legislative scrutiny of the budget and oversight of its execution. As the \nkey legislative committee of the National Assembly, the Economics, Planning and Finance \nCommittee (EPFC) is at the center of a number of crosscutting PFM policy initiatives. The EPFC \nfaces significant institutional and organizational challenges arising from the priorities of the draft \neighth NSEDP, and the Sam Sang implementation. The EPFC will require new administrative \nprocedures to define the financial relationships and oversight procedures between the provincial \nassemblies and the provincial administration, as well as the relationship between the National \nAssembly and the provincial assemblies. The EPFC will also require technical advice and \nsupport to establish appropriate mechanisms and deal with implementation issues as they arise. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s  past  interventions.  From 2005 to 2014, ADB has supported the Lao PDR \nthrough a cluster of TA projects on PFM issues and targeted financial assistance to reforms. \nADB sector work in the Lao PDR has contributed to strengthening (i) budget planning and \nbudget formulation process, reporting, and accounting systems for budget execution; and (ii) the \ninstitutions of state audit. Component 1 of the ongoing Governance and Capacity Development \nin  Public  Sector  Management  Program  has  strengthened  the  government\u2019s  capacity  and \npreparedness  to  adopt  a  medium-term  budget  framework,  though  significant  capacity \nchallenges  and  lack  of  political  buy-in  remain.4 The  design  of  the  TA  will  build  upon  the \nexperiences of this sustained support to reforms. \n                                                \n4  Initially,  support  was  to  assist  in  the  development  of methodological  frameworks  for  a  medium-term  fiscal \nframework and an MTEF process for the MOF (ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \n ", "3 \n8.  Value added from the technical assistance. The TA will sustain policy dialogue and \nongoing  reforms  under  the  Governance  and  Capacity  Development  in  Public  Sector \nManagement Program in areas such as budget reform and intergovernmental fiscal relations, \nand will build a platform for the next phase of ADB\u2019s support for public sector management \nreforms.5 Recent expansionary macroeconomic policies have put the Lao PDR under increasing \nfiscal strain that needs to be carefully managed in the long run, and adequate legislative \noversight is required. Expenditure decisions must be made in a multiyear context to not only to \naccount for the volatile nature and uncertainties associated with resource revenues, but also to \nalign expenditures to the priorities of the NSEDP and ensure that natural resources wealth is \ntransformed into investments in public infrastructure and services. Further, given government \ncommitments  to  Sam  Sang  reforms  that  entail  devolution  of  functions  and  resources  to \nsubnational  administrations,  transparent  and  formula-based  fiscal  transfers  will  enhance \nredistributive  gains.  Finally,  support  to  the  National  Assembly  (specifically  the  EPFC)  will \nstrengthen legislative oversight and improve accountability for resource use.  \n \n9.  Lessons learned and donor coordination. An important lesson learned from past \ninterventions is that reforms demand flexibility in implementation to respond to changes in \npriorities. This need is compounded in the case of the Lao PDR by the country\u2019s particular \npolitical and government institutional framework, rising fiscal pressures, and the low capacity in \nthe  government  agencies  at  all  levels.  Given  the  weak  enabling  environment  and  lack  of \nefficient managerial structures and capacity for institutions to succeed at an anticipated pace, it \nis  critical  that  ADB  stays  engaged  and  is  able  to  respond  promptly  to  TA  needs.  Public \nadministration and PFM reforms require effective coordination across several ministries. It is \nequally  important  to  understand  the  political  economy  of  reforms,  including  the  overall \nenvironment, and the formal and informal rules that govern the public sector management \nreform process in the country. These lessons have been taken into account in the design of the \nTA. ADB will collaborate closely with other development partners in the implementation of the \nTA, especially with the World Bank.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n10.  The impacts will be enhanced effectiveness of public governance and administration in \nthe Lao PDR, as envisaged under the NSEDP, 2016\u20132020, and improved service delivery. The \noutcome will be a strengthened policy-based budgeting system. The MTEF, anchored in a \nmedium-term fiscal framework providing realistic fiscal plans for achieving the government\u2019s \npolicy and development objectives, will strengthen the policy orientation of the budget by linking \nNSEDP priorities to the annual budget preparation process and also ensure that sector projects \n                                                                                                                                                       \nRepublic for Public Expenditure Planning for National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy. Manila [TA 4627-\nLAO]). ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Strengthening Public \nFinancial Management. Manila (TA 7077-LAO) further supported the MOF and selected line ministries with the \ndevelopment of an MTEF as a pilot. Under the TA, contribution was made to the development of a medium-term \nfiscal framework, fiscal strategy techniques and methodologies. A recently concluded project (ADB. 2012. Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Programmatic Approach, Policy-Based \nLoan and Grant, and Grant Assistance for Subprogram 1 to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the \nGovernance and Capacity Development in Public Sector Management Program. Manila) further strengthened the \ncapacity within the MOF to develop and improve the budget process from a multiyear perspective.  \n5  ADB. 2014.

Manila (Loan 3205-LAO).  \n ", "4 \nand  programs  are  realistically  costed  and  delivered  efficiently.  Indicators  and  performance \ntargets in relation to the three outputs are in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will have three outputs. \n \n(i)  Output  1:  Improved  budget  management  capacity  of  the  MOF  and  key  line \nministries. The TA will further develop the capacity of staff of the MOF and selected line \nministries in budget preparation by using the MTEF methodology together with advanced \nmacroeconomic tools for the preparation of a medium-term fiscal framework. Technical \nsupport will be provided to prepare medium-term budget projections and the overall set of \nmacroeconomic and fiscal assumptions required to arrive at the overall resource envelope \nand budget expenditure ceilings, using the medium-term budget framework developed with \nADB support.6 The TA will develop an implementation strategy to institutionalize the MTEF \nand  help  establish  an  appropriate  institutional  and  coordination  mechanism  for  project \nimplementation and technical guidance. In addition, the TA will provide support to the MOF \nto draft guidance notes and implementing regulations that are needed to deliver some of the \nkey requirements of the revised Budget Law.  \n \n(ii) Output  2:  Formula  based  fiscal  transfer  arrangement  gradually  adopted  and \nimplemented. The TA will support internalization of a nondiscretionary transfer mechanism \ndeveloped with ADB support by the MOF and all stakeholders and ensure gradual transition \nto an effective formula-based system in the budgets for 2016\u20132017 and 2017\u20132018. The TA \nwill also provide hands-on training on application of a formula-based transfer system and \nsupport the MOF in evaluating options for annual review of the transfer system.  \n \n(iii) Output 3: Legislative oversight of public finance strengthened. The TA will support \nthe EPFC members with technical advice, prepare policy papers, and organize training and \nworkshops relating to the mandate of the EPFC. In addition, the TA will strengthen the \nEPFC\u2019s role in financial oversight and capacity of EPFC members and staff in dealing with \npublic finance issues (including assessment of budget proposals and scrutiny of budget \nexecution,  including  the  audit  reports  produced  by  the  State  Audit  Organization).  \nImplementation risks from capacity constraints and resistance to change will be outweighed \nby strong and sustainable commitment of the government to public sector reforms. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.   The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($735,000 from TASF-V, and $265,000 from \nTASF-Others). The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, \noffice accommodation, office supplies, remuneration, per diem and domestic transportation of \ncounterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The Fiscal Policy Department of the MOF will be the executing agency for outputs 1 and \n2. Implementing agencies for output 1 will be the Ministry of Education and Sports, the Ministry \n                                                \n6 The medium-term budget framework developed gives a resource envelope projection at general government level \nover a 5-year horizon. The Microsoft Excel model follows a practical approach and allows flexibility to change \nassumptions based on changed circumstances. \n ", "5 \nof Health, the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, \nthe  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment,  and  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nInvestment. Implementing agencies for output 2 will be the Department of Budget (MOF) and \nthe Department of Local Finance and Sam Sang Secretariat (MOF). Given its independent \nstatus, the EPFC of the National Assembly will be the second executing agency for activities \nfalling  within  the  scope  of  its  mandate  and  authority  (output  3).  A  project  management \ncommittee, under the responsibility of the director general of Fiscal Policy Department, will be \nestablished in the MOF to monitor activities under the TA. The director general of the EPFC will \nundertake project management functions for activities concerning the EPFC. \n \n14.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  35  months  from  February  2016  to \nDecember 2018. The TA will provide a total of 26.5 person-months of international consulting \nservices in areas of budget management, fiscal planning (macroeconomics), intergovernment \nfinancial arrangements, capacity development and training, and institution strengthening (EPFC \nexpert). Two consultants (macroeconomic expert and training expert) will be engaged on a \nlump-sum basis. There will also be one national expert (estimated at 12 person-months) to \nsupport the international team of experts. All consultants will work on an intermittent basis and \nwill be engaged by ADB individually in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). Engagement will be on an individual basis as the terms \nof  reference  require  specialized  knowledge  and  distinct  professional  experience.  Similarly, \nbased on past experience of support in the Lao PDR, and aside from flexibility of schedule and \ngiven that there are two executing agencies, it will be more effective and efficient to monitor \noutputs of individual experts. Also, individual experts are preferred over firms because of budget \nconsiderations. The terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  While consultants will support and conduct training workshops and seminars, including \nlogistical arrangements, an advance payment facility will be used, as and when needed, by the \nexecuting  agencies,  which  have  significant  experience  in  implementing  ADB  projects.  For \ntraining activities, the MOF (for outputs 1 and 2) and EPFC (for output 3) will manage and \nadminister the activity costs, including the liquidation of advances. The training workshops will \nbe  for  technical  staff  from  the  MOF,  implementing  agencies,  EPFC,  and  the  Institute  of \nEconomics and Finance. Resource persons will likewise be engaged on a need basis. The \nproceeds of this TA will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Equipment will be procured in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Upon  project \ncompletion, all equipment purchased under the TA will be handed over to the executing agency \nin accordance with ADB guidelines. \n \n16.  The overall evaluation of the TA will be based on actual results compared with the \nperformance  targets  detailed  in  Appendix  1.  TA  inception  and  completion  reports  will  be \nsupplemented with periodic progress reports. TA review missions will be scheduled frequently to \nensure TA implementation is consistent with the government\u2019s emerging priorities. Findings and \nlessons  learned  from  the  TA  will  be  disseminated  through  seminars  and  workshops,  and \nthrough regular consultation with\u2014and reporting to\u2014the relevant partners. \n \nIV.
