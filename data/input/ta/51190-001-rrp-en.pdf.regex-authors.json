THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand a proposed grant, both to Nepal, for the Disaster Resilience of Schools Project. The report \nalso describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Clean Energy Fund \n(CEF) under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility for the project, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \napprove the administration of the CEF grant.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve the disaster resilience of schools in three provinces in Nepal2. \nThe project will support school infrastructure investments, disaster risk management (DRM), and \ninstitutional strengthening. It builds on and expands ongoing emergency reconstruction support \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB).3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Disaster risks and impacts. One of the most hazard-prone countries in the world, Nepal \nfaces weather-related hazards such as landslides, floods, and droughts. The frequency and \nintensity of such hazards may increase because of climate change. Nepal also experiences \nearthquakes, which could trigger landslides, floods, and fires. Although massive earthquakes \nhappen infrequently, they cause significant casualties, physical damage, and losses to the \neconomy.4 Damage and losses from the 2015 earthquake in Gorkha were assessed at $7 billion, \nwith 8,790 casualties, 22,300 injuries, 7,800 schools damaged, and 8 million people (almost 29% \nof the population) affected.5 \n \n4.  While natural hazards trigger disasters, the vulnerability and exposure of assets and \ncommunities determine the risks and the consequences of such events. The degree of physical \nvulnerability of assets is affected by the design, quality of construction, and maintenance, as well \nas weak institutional capacity and lack of expertise on how to pursue resilience. The level of \nexposure is affected by (i) the proximity of the asset to hazard zones; (ii) its age, occupancy, and \nusage; and (iii) the communities\u2019 level of disaster risk awareness and preparedness. To protect \npeople, safeguard investments, and promote sustainable development, the vulnerability and \nexposure of communities and physical assets to natural hazards must be reduced and the DRM \ncapacity of at-risk communities needs to be enhanced. \n \n5.  Plans and need for safe school infrastructure. More than 72% of the buildings of the \ncountry\u2019s 35,000 schools are unsafe and require seismic retrofitting.6 A 2016 structural integrity \nand damage assessment estimated that 2,234 schools are heavily damaged and not in use in 14 \ndistricts that were severely damaged by the 2015 earthquake.7 These schools have makeshift \n                                                \n1  Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \n2  The three provinces are 1, 3 and 4. \n3  ADB. 2015.

They also possess limited basic facilities, such as water \nsupply, sanitation, and electricity. About 25% will be rebuilt under planned and ongoing projects \nsupported by Nepal\u2019s development partners.8 The government is also seeking to finance the \nreconstruction of additional schools. However, a significant funding gap for school reconstruction \nremains, especially since 3,569 partially damaged schools with identified retrofitting needs are \nstill in use. The structural integrity and damage assessment shows that all these heavily and \npartially  damaged schools  are  vulnerable  to  seismic  hazards,  30%\u201350%  are  vulnerable  to \nprecipitation and earthquake-triggered landslides, and 5% are susceptible to flooding. In addition \nto resilient school infrastructure, Nepal needs other DRM actions and stronger institutional \ncapacity to safeguard communities and investments. \n \n6.  The  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  integrated  school  safety  in  its  National  Disaster  Risk \nReduction Policy and Strategic Action Plan, 2017\u20132030.9 It designated schools as key centers for \nraising  disaster  awareness,  a  major  factor  in  reducing  the  vulnerability  and  exposure  of \ncommunities. The Global Alliance for Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience in the Education \nSector developed a comprehensive school safety framework to provide safe learning facilities, \nschool DRM, and risk reduction and resilience education.10 ADB and other international agencies \nsupport these guidelines. \n \n7.  The project. The project will rehabilitate school infrastructure and complement efforts of \nan ongoing education program to improve the quality of school education, access to education, \nand school management.11 The preparation of gender-sensitive and inclusive DRM planning will \nsupplement the retrofitting and reconstruction efforts. The DRM action plan will be informed by \nthe comprehensive school safety framework and a gap assessment of activities to be undertaken \nby other development partners and through interagency coordination.12 \n \n8.  Policy and strategy alignment. The project aligns with the government\u2019s Post Disaster \nRecovery  Framework,  Preliminary  Damage  and  Needs  Assessment,  and  School  Sector \nDevelopment Plan (SSDP), 2016\u20132030\u2014the government\u2019s most recent and most comprehensive \n                                                \n8  Through the Earthquake Emergency Assistance Project (footnote 3) and the Disaster Risk Reduction and Livelihood \nRestoration for Earthquake-Affected Communities Project (ADB. 2015.

Manila), ADB is reconstructing 162 schools in Nepal. The \nJapan International Cooperation Agency provided $112 million to reconstruct 236 schools, the Government of India \nallocated $50 million to reconstruct 70 schools, and the United States Agency for International Development and the \nDepartment  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom  provided  their  support.

Post-earthquake  projects  and  lessons.  The  ongoing  ADB  reconstruction  projects \n(footnote 8) are under full implementation. As of the end July 2018, reconstruction of 30 (out of \n162) schools have been substantially completed, and all the envisaged microcredit activities have \nbeen achieved. Both projects will be completed by June 2019. The project incorporates the \nfollowing lessons learned from ADB\u2019s previous reconstruction activities in Nepal and other \ncountries: (i) support investment mainly in secondary schools in urban and rural areas that will \nhave significant impact on education targets, (ii) focus on improving infrastructure design for \nresilience  and  strengthening  decentralized  supervision  to  enhance  implementation  quality, \n(iii) carefully plan civil works procurement to encourage wider response and competition to scale \nup reconstruction, (iv) use reliable building condition assessments in evaluating moderately \ndamaged  buildings  targeted  for  retrofitting,  (v)  establish  a  capable  and  experienced \nimplementation team at the start of the project, (vi) use proven implementation arrangements, \nand (vii) enforce project-readiness criteria. \n \n10.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project will (i) help fill the significant funding gap \nin developing disaster-resilient schools; (ii) develop knowledge, skills, and capacity to meet higher \ndesign standards for resilient infrastructure; and (iii) strengthen information systems for school \ninfrastructure inventory to enable prioritization of urgent needs. The project also includes an \ninnovative approach to pilot community-based retrofitting in three selected schools that will  \nenable municipalities to replicate such retrofitting activities using local funding under the new \nfederal government structures. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n11.  The project is aligned with the following impact: DRM for human resource development \nenhanced (footnotes 5 and 13). The project will have the following outcome: disaster resilience of \nschools and communities increased and learning environment improved.14 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  Output 1: Heavily damaged schools reconstructed and improved. The project will \nreconstruct to earthquake-resilient standards the heavily damaged buildings of 163 schools in the \n14 districts most affected by the earthquake.15 The reconstructed schools will have general \nscience laboratories; computer-equipped ICT rooms; libraries; water, sanitation, and hygiene \nfacilities that are segregated, have changing and disposal facilities for menstruating females, and \nare accessible to people with disabilities; and solar power supply or backup. To mitigate potential \nweather-related hazards to schools and to ensure a safe learning environment, reconstruction will \nfollow the Indian Standard Criteria for Earthquake Resistant Design of Structures.16 Off-grid and \non-grid solar power systems will be installed in 130 of the 163 targeted schools.

The targeted schools \ninclude 145 secondary schools and 18 feeder basic schools that will help achieve the SSDP goal \nof 85% enrollment in secondary schools.18 \n \n13.  Output 2: Unsafe schools retrofitted and disaster risk reduced. This output targets \n138 schools that have buildings with retrofitting needs, including 127 schools targeted under \noutput 1 as these schools include also construction of improved facilities, and 11 feeder basic \nschools  with  only  building  retrofitting  needs.  The  construction  of  improved  facilities  will \ncomplement the retrofitting works to reach a comparable learning environment sought for the \nschools reconstructed under output 1. As with output 1, schools will be selected based on \nenrollment size, scale of damage, and equity considerations. The project will also support the \ndevelopment of a DRM action plan and training program for school management committees \n(SMCs), students, and communities; and field testing of the risk management action plans in \nselected reconstructed and retrofitted schools. \n \n14.  Output 3: Institutional capacity for disaster resilience strengthened. This output will \nstrengthen (i) the education management information system (EMIS) to improve school building \ninventory and condition, as well as local SMC reporting to the EMIS;19 (ii) the capacity of an \nimplementation unit and the municipalities to design and build disaster-resilient structures; and \n(iii) SMC capacity to operate and adequately maintain schools using local government funding.20 \nGiven the retrofitting needs that will remain, the project will develop a toolbox, which will be pilot \ntested in three schools, to help the community retrofit schools using local government funds. \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  The project team conducted initial and detailed appraisal of the schools during project \npreparation. The project will reconstruct and/or retrofit the school buildings to earthquake-resilient \nstandards, improve slope stability, and properly design rainwater drainage collection and outlet \nstructures. Each secondary school will include infrastructure for a general science laboratory, a \n ", "7 \nlibrary, an ICT computer room, and segregated toilets for boys and girls with changing and \ndisposal facilities for menstruating females. The project will train SMCs in school operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) and upgrade the MOEST\u2019s EMIS to account for school building inventory, \ncondition, and maintenance needs. \n \n21.  The project will include adaptation and mitigation measures in infrastructure design and \ninstall solar panel systems in off-grid schools and selected grid-connected schools as backup or \na cheaper alternative electricity source. Its solar power systems will increase clean power \ngeneration capacity by about 1 megawatt, resulting in 1,500 megawatt-hours of energy per year, \nequivalent to avoiding about 1,200 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. The climate change \nrisk screening confirms that the project\u2019s climate change risk is moderate.22 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  Economic analysis. The economic internal rate of return was estimated at 7.8%, which \nis sufficient for social sector or DRM projects.23 The economic analysis was carried out following \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.24 The project will develop safer schools \nand  safety  awareness  of  communities,  as  well  as  improve  the  learning  environment  by \nreconstructing and retrofitting public schools in the 14 districts affected by the 2015 earthquake. \nThe principal benefits considered in the analysis were improved education access, internal \nefficiency, disaster impact mitigation, and improved facilities over the analyzed period. The \nprincipal costs are capital expenditures for reconstructing and retrofitting public schools, O&M, \nhousehold investment for school, and opportunity cost of attending school. The sensitivity analysis \nof the estimated economic returns to key assumptions indicated that the overall investment will \nremain economically viable with a 10% capital cost overrun and a 10% decrease in benefits. \n \n23.  Financial analysis. The government budget allocation for education was NRs109.4 billion \nin 2016\u20132017, in line with the expansion of the overall budget. The Local Government Operation \nAct, 2074 (2017) decentralized the education budget for 2017\u20132018, reducing the share of the \ncentral budget and increasing the local budget. Basic and secondary schools account for about \n80% of public education spending. Rather than build new schools, this project aims to reconstruct \nand retrofit existing schools, which does not require additional recurrent budget. However, the \ncurrent level of O&M spending for schools is insufficient. As part of the policy dialogue with the \ngovernment on SSDP, the project team will monitor during project implementation whether the \nO&M allocation to each targeted local government is appropriate.25 The project is expected to \nhelp improve budget expenditure. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  Financial management. The financial management assessment concluded that the \nCLPIU\u2019s financial management risk is substantial. The key risks are (i) project activities may not \ncontinue after the executing and implementing agencies, which are time-bound entities, complete \ntheir tenure; and (ii) newly appointed accounting staff for the project may not be familiar with ADB \nprocedures. However, the CLPIU has implemented ADB projects with no major issues,26 and with \nthe implementation of the proposed risk-mitigating measures, the financial management risk of \nthe project will be satisfactory. The mitigation measures include conducting a midterm review of \n                                                \n22 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 ADB. 2017.

A financial management expert will be engaged by CLPIU to provide capacity building \nsupport under the project. \n \n25.  Procurement. All procurement of goods and works and recruitment of consultants will \nfollow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nRegulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  procurement \nassessment concluded that the project procurement classification is category B, and the project \nprocurement risk is substantial. However, this risk will be mitigated by CLPIU\u2019s project experience \nand the proposed engagement of a procurement specialist to strengthen the unit\u2019s procurement \ncapacity. Since the project involves ADB administration of cofinancing for an operation financed \nby the Asian Development Fund, universal procurement will apply.27 \n \n26.  Anticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. The constitutional anticorruption agency is \nthe Commission for the Investigation of Abuse and Authority, which is empowered to investigate \nany project irregularities. The CLPIU will follow government rules and procedures for expenses. \nThe CLPIU will disclose all key project-related information, including a system and procedures for \nhandling complaints, on its website following 2 months from effectiveness of the loan and grants. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The project team has prepared \na summary poverty reduction and social strategy and a gender action plan.28 The project will \nprovide adequate sex-segregated water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities that are accessible to \npeople  with  disabilities.  The  facilities  will  also  have  changing  and  disposal  facilities  for \nmenstruating females. The school buildings will be well lit with stairs, ramps, and playgrounds \naccessible to people with disabilities. DRM and school safety assessments identified the different \nneeds of girls and women, including persons with disabilities, which the project will consider in its \nrisk management and preparedness plans. The menstrual health and hygiene of girls will be \nenhanced through water and toilet facilities, relevant training on cleanliness, use of sanitary pads, \nand health care during menstruation in schools. A female teacher in each school will be trained \nto guide girls on menstrual health.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n28.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.29 \n \n29.  Environment (category B). NRA prepared an environmental assessment and review \nframework (EARF) and an initial environmental examination (IEE) following ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement and government laws. They were disclosed on ADB\u2019s website. NRA considered \nsix sample school subprojects in two project districts for preparing the IEE. Given the size and \nnature of work and location of the schools on existing premises, the IEE concluded that no \nsignificant adverse impacts are anticipated. The project is not expected to encroach upon national \n                                                \n27 ADB 2013.

Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "9 \nparks and protected ecosystems, ancient heritage sites, and their buffer zones. Some key impacts \nenvisaged  could  be  landslides,  erosion,  flooding,  spoil  and  solid  waste  management,  and \noccupational health and safety. The environmental management plan in the IEE and the EARF \nsuggests mitigation measures for the potential impacts. The EARF will guide the mainstreaming \nof  environmental  safeguards  during  the  full  project  cycle,  including  school  selection  using \nenvironmental criteria; environmental screening, categorization, and assessment; preparation of \na mitigation plan; and compliance monitoring and reporting. The EARF also suggests conducting \nregular communication and consultation with stakeholders, and using the existing grievance \nredress mechanism. The CLPIU safeguards desk and the safeguard lead in a district-level project \nimplementation unit,30 supported by a national environment specialist (intermittent input) and full-\ntime safeguard monitors (one in each project district) will be responsible for overall compliance \nand timely submission of reports. A contractor, with prior approval from the district-level project \nimplementation unit, will appoint an environment and safety officer responsible for implementing \nthe environmental management plan. The project team will provide safeguards orientation to \nSMCs to enhance their capacity for safeguards assurance during construction and operation of \nthe schools. \n \n30.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement impact assessment confirms that impacts are not significant. NRA, and the CLPIU \nprepared a due diligence report for social safeguards based on a review of 67 schools to be \nreconstructed. The remaining 107 schools to be reconstructed will be identified and selected \nduring implementation. Reconstruction will be carried out mostly within the existing boundaries of \nthe schools. Following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, NRA and the CLPIU prepared a \nresettlement  framework  to  provide  guidance  for  screening,  impact  assessment,  safeguard \nplanning, and implementation.31 NRA and the CLPIU disclosed the framework on the ADB website \nand included procedures if land is required. NRA, in coordination with the CLPIU, will ensure the \ntimely and adequate implementation of the resettlement framework for each school selection, \nscreening, impact assessment, and mitigation measures. NRA capacity will be strengthened \nthrough training and consultant support. On behalf of NRA, the CLPIU will prepare a screening \nreport, a due diligence report, and a resettlement plan; these documents will be submitted to ADB \nfor review and approval. The CLPIU will enhance the existing three-level grievance redress \nmechanism in project areas. \n \n31.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C).  The  project  will  reconstruct  and/or  retrofit  the \nearthquake-damaged school buildings mostly within the existing boundaries of the schools. It will \nhave no identified or expected impact on the culture, human rights, or livelihood system of \nindigenous people in the project area. The project will not have any differential impact on learning \npractices of children from indigenous groups since its scope covers only reconstruction and/or \nretrofitting of school buildings. All schools will be screened by applying eligibility criteria for school \nselection. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n32.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.32 \n \n                                                \n30 The district-level project implementation unit is also referred to as a local-level project implementation unit. \n31 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nMOEST assuming executing agency  ADB and the government will review and agree on continued \nrole from NRA delays project  implementation arrangements during the midterm review of the \nimplementation.  project to ensure implementation will not be disrupted. \nThe CLPIU does not have adequate  NRA will deploy three additional staff (a senior accounts officer, \naccounting staff to perform additional  an accounts officer, and an accountant from the Financial \nfinancial management responsibility for  Comptroller General Office) and a financial management \nthe project.  expert (consultant) in the CLPIU. \nThe CLPIU has insufficient staff and  This will be mitigated by (i) filling staff vacancies at the CLPIU, \nlacks familiarity to efficiently undertake  (ii) developing the procurement capacity of CLPIU staff through \nprocurement and contract management  training, (iii) engaging an individual procurement specialist to \nactivities.  support the CLPIU\u2019s procurement unit, (iv) seeking ADB\u2019s \norientation and guidance during bid evaluation, and (v) going \nthrough ADB\u2019s procurement oversight and project monitoring. \nOperations and maintenance funding  This will be mitigated by the ongoing education program, which \nallocation is inadequate.  will monitor allocations to the local governments of the 14 \ndistricts under a new federal structure.a \nADB = Asian Development Bank; CLPIU = Central Level Project Implementation Unit; MOEST = Ministry of Education, \nScience and Technology; NRA = National Reconstruction Authority. \na  ADB. 2016.
