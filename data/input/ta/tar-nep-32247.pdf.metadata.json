His Majesty\u2019s Government of Nepal requested technical assistance (TA) to prepare the\nTenth Five-Year Plan (FY2002\u2013FY2007) during the 1998 Country Programming Mission.1 The\nTA Fact-Finding Mission from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) visited Nepal on 9\u201319 April\n2001. The Mission\u2019s main objectives were to gather inputs on the scope and design of the\nrequested TA from Government agencies, major bilateral and multilateral funding agencies in\nNepal, and other stakeholders. The Mission reached an understanding with the Government\nregarding  the  TA\u2019s  objectives  and  scope,  costs  and  financing,  tentative  implementation\narrangements, and counterpart support.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2.  A planning approach to development in Nepal began in 1956 with the First Five-Year\nPlan (FY1956\u2013FY1961). Eight periodic plans have since been implemented, with the Ninth Five-\nYear Plan (FY1997\u2013FY2002) underway. Despite Nepal\u2019s long planning tradition, the planning\nmethodology has not kept up with changes in other countries that also have a strong planning\ntradition. A centralized approach compounded by lack of adequate prioritization undermines\nNepal\u2019s planning approach. The country needs to plan its public resource use carefully but\nbased on a decentralized and participatory approach to focus on poverty reduction, since Nepal\nremains one of the poorest countries in the world, with a per capita income of $244 and a\npoverty incidence of 42 percent.\n3.  The  Government  identified  a  number  of  weaknesses  contributing  to  past  planning\nproblems: (i) overprogramming and a failure to set priorities for poverty reduction, (ii) excessive\ncentralization,  (iii)  inadequate  processes  for  securing  commitment  and  managing  political\ninterference, (iv) failure to specify appropriate implementation arrangements, and (v) ineffective\nmonitoring capacity.\n4.  Other challenges to preparing the Tenth Five-Year Plan include the need to (i) use a\nparticipatory  process  and  integrate  other  work  undertaken  with  ADB  assistance  for  the\npreparation of the Government\u2019s interim poverty reduction strategy,2 (ii) accommodate local\npriorities and capacities in line with the Local Self-Governance Act, (iii) accommodate and\nensure  consistency  of  other  policies  and  Government  priorities,  (iv)  clarify  the  role  of  the\nGovernment  relative  to  the  private  sector  and  local  government,  and  (v)  address  the\nimplications of accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n5.  Addressing  past  planning  problems  and  new  challenges  is  a  key  aspect  of  the\nGovernment\u2019s  shift  to  poverty-focused  planning.  Acutely  aware  of  these  weakness  and\nchallenges,  the  Government  has  taken  a  focused  and  effective  participatory  approach  to\npreparing the interim poverty reduction strategy, which has drawn on ADB\u2019s substantial inputs.\nThe TA will continue to support institutionalizing the poverty-focused, participatory approach,\nwhich will require medium-term engagement to build Government capacity. The TA will not set\npriorities; rather, it will help to establish participatory processes, and information bases and\nanalyses so that the Government, stakeholders, and general public can arrive at informed\ndecisions.  Such  decisions  will  recognize  the  tradeoffs  and  costs  involved  in  choosing\ndevelopment priorities.\n                                                          \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 23 April 2001 (Internet edition).\n2 TA 3362-NEP: Partnership Agreement on Poverty Reduction between ADB and the Government of Nepal, for\n$125,000, approved on 22 December 1999.", "2\n6.  Past  weaknesses  in  planning  are  symptomatic  of  two  core  challenges  to  setting\npriorities. First, setting priorities is a complex technical task requiring detailed information, sound\nanalysis, and good judgement. Second, even sound priorities require social consensus. The TA\naddresses both challenges. It will help the National Planning Commission (NPC) with technical\naspects  and  participatory  processes  to  secure  stakeholder  consensus.  The  Government,\nthrough NPC, has shown commitment and capacity to shift from the traditional structured top-\ndown process to more participatory processes in developing its poverty reduction strategy.\nUnder  quite  difficult  circumstances,  the  Government  is  also  tackling,  frequently  with  ADB\nsupport, a number of critical governance, financial, and economic policy reforms to promote\ngrowth  and  reduce  poverty.  These  reform  efforts  are  all  essential  building  blocks  of  the\noverarching poverty reduction strategy being pursued by the Government and ADB.\n7.  As the defining statement of the final poverty reduction strategy, the Tenth Five-Year\nPlan will draw these reform activities into ongoing budget and planning processes. The TA will\nhelp the Government prepare a Tenth Five-Year Plan as its clearly prioritized poverty reduction\nstrategy, with the Government as regulator and guide. The plan is of crucial importance for\npoverty reduction. In the new planning environment, this small TA could have a substantial\nimpact.\nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n8.  The objective of the TA is to help the Government prepare a Tenth Five-Year Plan\n(FY2002\u2013FY2007) as the statement of its final poverty reduction strategy. It will seek to reduce\npoverty by setting priorities based on realistic resource estimates and securing support and\ncommitment for those priorities from the Government, including central and line ministries, and\namong stakeholders through public consultation. The plan will build on the processes used to\nprepare the interim poverty reduction strategy. The TA\u2019s international and domestic consultants\nwill facilitate the processes and provide technical advice to NPC to help it prepare the plan and\naddress the challenges and concerns raised in para. 4.\nB.  Scope\n9.  The TA will (i) identify and assess long-term options for pro-poor development; (ii)\nidentify priorities and strategies for poverty reduction based on realistic resource estimates; (iii)\nspecify procedures for implementing the plan and for monitoring performance, including of the\nbudget process; (iv) help to ensure public participation and transparency in plan preparation;\nand (v) help to meet the challenges identified in para. 4. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\n1.  Identify Long-Term Options\n10.  The TA will help the Government assess the main internal and external factors affecting\nNepal\u2019s pro-poor development in the long term. Domestic matters include (i) demographic\nchanges, arising from population growth, age structure, and migration; (ii) structural vulnerability\narising from the high dependence on agriculture; and (iii) political instability. External factors to\nbe considered are (i) economic developments in India, (ii) the impact of the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina\u2019s  accession  to  WTO,  and  (iii)  technical  and  institutional  development  in  information\ntechnology (IT).", "3\n2. Establish Priorities and Identify Financial and Institutional Constraints\n11.  While the Ninth Five-Year Plan covers most issues, it fails to set priorities for poverty\nreduction, reflecting pressures to please multiple parties, and unrealistic estimation of funds\navailable. The TA will build NPC\u2019s capacity to set priorities based on realistic medium-term\nresource estimates. First, the TA must estimate the amount of development funds available,\ninitially focusing on Government resources and funder contributions. But the TA must also\nconsider private sector investment, including foreign direct investment and the impact on it of an\nenabling policy environment. Second, the TA will help refine criteria for program and project\nappraisal, drawing on the principles spelled out in the Public Expenditure Review Commission\nReport. Third, the TA will help NPC prepare a framework for estimating and illustrating the\nimpact of variations in plan priorities on incomes and poverty reduction.\n3. Specify Implementation and Monitoring Arrangements\n12.  Some reasons for the weak performance of the Ninth Five-Year Plan are inadequate\nattention  paid  to  implementation  procedures,  and  the  limited  information  and  resources\navailable to NPC to monitor outcomes. Priorities cannot be set without a realistic appreciation of\nimplementation  needs  and  priorities.  Ineffective  monitoring  also  encourages  plan  slippage.\nThus, the TA will need to strengthen NPC\u2019s capacity to specify and monitor the implementation\nprocess.\n4. Develop and Apply Participatory Processes\n13.  While past participation of line ministries and other parties was substantial, it does not\nappear to have been effective. For the Tenth Five-Year Plan, NPC intends to identify core plan\nareas or priorities and to establish subcommittees to prepare discussion papers for developing\nthe  plan.  The  subcommittees  will  be  chaired  by  an  NPC  member  and  comprise  senior\nrepresentatives  of  relevant  line  ministries,  representatives  of  civil  society,  academics,  and\nprivate sector stakeholders. The TA consultancy services will support the subcommittees.\n14.  NPC has prepared a draft paper setting out the approach to the plan, and convened\nworkshops in selected regions to discuss the proposed approach. NPC will also make the paper\navailable to the public in print and on the NPC web site, and may call for submissions from\ninterested parties. NPC plans to employ a similar public consultation process to discuss the\ndraft progress reports and the draft final report with all the concerned agencies, interested\nfunding agencies, and representatives of civil society and the private sector. Participation needs\nto  be  focused,  informed,  and  structured  so  that  participants  recognize  tradeoffs  and  are\nequipped to resolve them. Participation should secure a broad-based consensus on poverty\nreduction priorities to strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity to implement them. The TA should\nhelp NPC with these activities, and provide information and frameworks focusing on poverty\nreduction.\n5. Address New Challenges\n15.  The TA will help NPC address new challenges in preparing the plan. One challenge is to\nbuild on the interim poverty reduction strategy and finalize the plan as the Government\u2019s full-\nfledged poverty reduction strategy. The interim poverty reduction strategy was prepared with\nsignificant  ADB  support.  The  Government\u2019s  request  for  further  assistance  to  complete  the\nstrategy reflects the satisfaction of all parties with the outcomes of the previous TA and the", "4\nactivities it supported. Another challenge is to reallocate responsibilities for decentralization and\nlinkages to budget resources. The priority-setting process and recent move towards a market-\noriented economy will require a delineation of the roles of the Government, private sector, and\ncivil society. Nepal\u2019s external trade situation is unique, and the plan must explore the impacts of\nnatural and policy barriers on international trade and foreign direct investment, and examine\nopportunities for new industries, such as IT, created by a combination of technology change and\ndismantling of barriers to trade in traditional goods such as agricultural products. Accession to\nWTO will involve significant commitments by Nepal.\n16.  The  TA\u2019s  scope,  expected  effectiveness,  and  justification  depend  on  Government\ncommitment to putting the reform framework in place. The framework will (i) identify priorities for\npoverty reduction, (ii) assess what can realistically be achieved with available budget resources\nand institutions, (iii) employ transparent public processes, and (iv) monitor in a timely and\ncomprehensive manner achievements under the plan. Poverty reduction priorities will need to\nbe  accompanied  by  clear  implementation  procedures  that  define  responsibility  and\naccountability. The TA design complements other ADB projects and provides for their direct\ninputs into the plan. TA design, timing, and coordination have been discussed with other major\nbilateral and multilateral funding agencies to ensure effective coordination.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $370,000 equivalent, of which the foreign exchange cost is\n$154,000 and the local currency cost is $216,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $300,000 on a\ngrant basis from the ADB-funded TA program to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and\n$146,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will contribute the remaining\nlocal currency cost of $70,000 equivalent to provide office accommodation, counterpart staff\nsupport, facilities for seminars and meetings, and other administrative expenses. Details of cost\nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n18.  NPC will be the Executing Agency for the proposed TA. TA activities will be guided by a\nsteering  committee  chaired  by  the  NPC  vice  chair.  The  committee  will  provide  strategic\nleadership in preparing the plan and coordinate the planning process. The committee will assign\nsubcommittees to study and report on priority areas and will integrate subcommittee reports into\na cohesive plan. A unit will be attached to the steering committee to coordinate activities of the\nconsultants and the various subcommittees. Senior management teams will also be established\nin  line  ministries  to  ensure  that  subcommittees  are  fully  supported.  Appendix  3  sets  out\nimplementation arrangements. The TA team leader will be responsible for managing the funds\nfor procurement of equipment, seminars, and meetings.\n19.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months, from July 2001 to July 2002. Tripartite\nmeetings of the Government, TA consultants, and ADB will be chaired by the NPC vice chair,\nand held every three months to review TA implementation priorities, address issues arising\nduring TA implementation, and provide guidance to the TA consultants. The steering committee\nwill meet at the beginning of the project and then every three months to guide the TA and\nresolve  policy  and  implementation  issues.  The  steering  committee  and  subcommittees  will\nregularly invite representatives of civil society and other stakeholders to contribute to the TA.\nStakeholder consultation seminars and meetings will be held to discuss the TA\u2019s progress and\nobtain inputs on the scope and design of the plan.", "5\n20.  The  TA  will  provide  4.5  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  27\nperson-months of domestic consulting services. The international consultant will be skilled and\nexperienced in macroeconomic planning, priority setting for poverty reduction, and planning\nprocesses. The domestic consultants will be selected to cover sectoral and cross-cutting issues,\nand further consulting input needs identified as plan preparation proceeds. Several areas are\nsufficiently  well  developed  so  that  local  consulting  needs  can  be  specified  in  advance.\nPreliminary identification of the areas to be covered suggests the following: (i) macroeconomic,\nplanning, and priority setting; (ii) agriculture; (iii) resources; (iv) infrastructure; and (v) social\ndevelopment.  Agricultural  planning  inputs  will  be  coordinated  with  the  Agriculture  Sector\nPerformance Review started in June 2001.3 As the planing process identifies the need for other\nspecialists  in,  for  example,  IT,  urban  and  regional  planning,  environment,  gender,  and/or\ngovernance, the initial specification might be modified. Such modification will be approved by\nthe steering committee and ADB. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4.\n21.  The TA consultants will be selected and engaged on an individual basis in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB\nfor  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  TA  will  support  purchase  of  computer\nequipment, and improvement of services for web site design and maintenance. The web site will\nstrengthen  public  dissemination  of  the  plan  processes,  and  provide  access  to  the  plan\u2019s\ndatabase. Equipment and systems procured under the TA will be handed over to NPC upon\ncompletion of the TA.\n22.  To reinforce the Government\u2019s ownership, TA contributions to the plan will be in the form\nof NPC outputs. However, the consultants will prepare planning and progress reports describing\nTA activities and flag institutional and technical issues. The consultants will prepare (i) an\ninception report including a detailed TA work program to be submitted one month after TA\nimplementation commences; (ii) reports for the tripartite meetings, indicating progress made,\noutstanding  issues,  and  work  plans  for  the  next  quarter;  (iii)  a  draft  final  report  to  the\nGovernment to be submitted one month before TA completion; and (iv) a final report submitted\nat  the  conclusion  of  the  consulting  services.  All  reports  will  be  submitted  to  the  steering\ncommittee and ADB.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n23. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to His Majesty\u2019s Government of Nepal in an\namount not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 for the purpose of support for preparation of\nthe Tenth Five-Year Plan, and hereby reports such action to the Board.\n                                                          \n3 TA 3536-NEP: Agriculture Sector Performance Review, for $600,000, approved on 13 November 2000.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOGICAL FRAMEWORK\nDesign Performance Monitoring Assumptions\nSummary Indicators and Mechanisms and Risks\nTargets\nGoal\n\u2022  Help the \u2022  In the short term, \u2022  Steps for \u2022  Government is\nGovernment a clearly prioritized reporting and strongly\ndeliver a 10th plan with specified participation committed to\nfive-year plan that implementation specified in the preparing and\nwill reduce arrangements plan delivering the\npoverty \u2022  In the long term, \u2022  Tripartite plan.\nadoption of the meetings, and\nplan draft and final\n\u2022  Growth and reports specified\npoverty reduction in the technical\nassistance\nActivities/Outputs\n\u2022  Identify long-term \u2022  Impact on \u2022  Tripartite meeting \u2022  Government\noptions and assumptions in the assessment revenues for\ntrends paper on the \u2022  Impact on the development can\napproach and on NPC approach to be estimated and\nthe use of internal the plan set aside.\nand external \u2022  Media and \u2022  Funding agency\nmacro trends and stakeholder support can be\nscenarios feedback projected.\n\u2022  Foreign direct\ninvestment will\nrespond.\n\u2022  Build and apply a \u2022  Framework paper \u2022  Tripartite meeting \u2022  Ranking will be\nframework for \u2022  Acceptance of the \u2022  Observed practical even\nidentifying framework by the appreciation of with a large\npriorities and National Planning framework to number of\nconstraints Commission prepare the plan priorities.\n(NPC) \u2022  NPC will\nwithstand\npressure to\ninclude more\npriorities than can\nbe resourced.\n\u2022  Specify \u2022  Evaluation of \u2022  Tripartite meeting \u2022  Implementation\nimplementation priorities in terms \u2022  Revised rankings arrangements for\narrangements of implementation based on analysis priorities will be\nand monitoring needs and of implementation practical.\nprocedures capacity to practicalities\nmonitor \u2022  Minutes of the\n\u2022  Specification of steering\ndetailed committee\nmonitoring\narrangements for\nplan priorities\n(Reference in Text: page 2, para. 9)", "7\nAppendix 1, page 2\nDesign Performance Monitoring Assumptions\nSummary Indicator/Target Mechanism And Risks\n\u2022  Design and assist \u2022  Plan participation \u2022  Drafts prepared \u2022  NPC and line\nwith processes proceeds for tripartite ministries\nfor transparency according to reviews embrace public\nand public announced \u2022  Minutes from the participation\nparticipation schedule Steering \u2022  Public participants\n\u2022  Guidelines for Committee are disciplined\npublic participation \u2022  Media and expectations\nare produced commenting on are not unduly\n\u2022  Public and openness of raised\nstakeholder process\ninvolvement in \u2022  Civil society and\nprocesses stakeholder\nfeedback\n\u2022  Ensure the Plan \u2022  Relevant \u2022  Tripartite meeting \u2022  NPC has the\naccommodates contemporary \u2022  Minutes of the support,\ncontemporary challenges Steering commitment and\nchallenges and addressed in the Committee capacity to\nconcerns Plan \u2022  Content of draft address these\n\u2022  Merges  effectively Plan issues these\nwith poverty \u2022  Media and issues\nreduction strategy stakeholder \u2022  Plan does not\n\u2022  Accommodates comment become unduly\ndecentralization complex as a\ndemands result of\n\u2022  Effectively spells accommodating\nout and tackles too many\nimplications of considerations\nWorld Trade\nOrganization\naccession\n\u2022  International \u2022  4.5 person months \u2022  ADB review \u2022  Timely\nconsultant missions and recruitment and\n\u2022  Domestic \u2022  27 person months tripartite review deployment of\nconsultants meeting consultants\n\u2022  Adequate and\nTotal Costs \u2022  $370,000 timely provision of\n\u2022  ADB Financing \u2022  $300,000 counterpart\n\u2022  Government \u2022  $  70,000 budget, staff and\nfinancing facilities\n\u2022  Commitment to\npriority setting by\nGovernment", " 8\nAppendix 2\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.
