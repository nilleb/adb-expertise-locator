THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  Sri Lanka\u2019s energy sector performance has achieved a national electrification ratio of 99.3% \n(2016) of the households up from 29% in 1990.1 However, the demand for electricity continues to \ngrow with increasing economic growth and improving living standards of the population.  While \ntrying to meet this increasing demand the sector continues to struggle because of the high cost \nof electricity emanating from poor generation mix and inadequate level of reliability. This is partly \ndue to underinvestment in the transmission network, medium voltage network, and protection \nsystem resulting from high government debt-to-GDP ratio over the years and the poor financial \nstatus of Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)\u2014the state-owned public utility whose operations have \nbeen constrained by non-implementation of full cost recovery tariff and receivables. \n \n2.  In 2015\u20132016, Sri Lanka suffered three country-wide blackouts within the span of 7 months. \nAll these blackouts were attributed to poor operation of the protection system, lack of operational \nflexibility and bottlenecks in the transmission system. Economic loss from the three blackouts was \nestimated at monetarized value at the unit of $/kWh un-served activity. Indirect social impacts, \nsuch as increase in crime rates, were also reported.  \n3.  Strengthening the transmission system, improving the 33/11 kilovolt (kV) medium voltage \nnetwork, and upgrading the protection system are needed to ensure reliable operation of the \npower system. These interventions will also help increase absorption of intermittent wind and \nsolar power which in turn will contribute to achieving government targets for clean energy \ndevelopment.   Similarly, these will improve the quality of power supply in rural areas, where \ncurrently the quality is low. \n \n4.  The project is consistent with the national sector investment program that is based on the \nNational Energy Policy and Strategies of Sri Lanka2 and Vision 2025.3 The project is also in line \nwith Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) country partnership strategy for Sri Lanka where the \nenergy sector is expected to focus on, among others, expanding nontraditional renewable energy \nusing wind and solar, and improving reliability of power supply.4 The project is also strongly linked \nto recently approved ADB programs supporting investments in removing bottlenecks in power \ntransmission and strengthening distribution system, and expanding access to clean electricity and \npromote renewable energy development. \n \n5.  Lessons from previous projects will be considered and incorporated into the project design \nand implementation arrangements.  Specifically, the project will integrate renewable energy, and \nimprove implementation arrangements by strengthening CEB and Lanka Electricity Company \n(Private) Ltd. (LECO)5 capacity in complex project supervision and safeguard monitoring.  \n \n6.  ADB Value Addition. The project will involve a careful analysis of the existing power \nprotection systems and implement appropriate solutions to ensure optimum reliability of supply \n                                                \n1  Ceylon Electricity Board. 2017.

Manila. \n5 Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is a state-owned corporation established on 1 November 1969 under the Ceylon \nElectricity Board Act No. 17 of 1969. CEB is engaged in power generation, transmission, distribution and supply of \nelectricity. Lanka Electricity Company (Private) Ltd. (LECO) is a private limited liability company incorporated in 1983 \nfor the purpose of electricity distribution in Sri Lanka under the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982 and Companies Act \nNo. 7 of 2007. CEB and the Ministry of Finance are the major shareholders of LECO, among other shareholders, \nmainly state entities. \n ", "3 \nunder critical contingencies.  By consolidating experiences from ongoing and past ADB projects, \nthe project will enhance the capacity of CEB and LECO to plan, design, implement, manage, \nmonitor, and operate ADB-financed projects, and improve safeguards implementation of power \nprojects.  Latest and advanced technologies (such as the Wide Area Monitoring System, low-loss \nconductors for transmission and energy efficient transformers for distribution) will be incorporated \ninto the design of the transmission system and medium voltage distribution system to minimize \nsystem losses and increase reliability.  \n \n \nII.
