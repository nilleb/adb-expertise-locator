An environmental impact assessment was completed.  \nAssessment \n   \nInvestment Program  The Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program (PIAIP) will \nDescription  support physical and nonphysical investments in the water resource \nand irrigated agriculture sectors in Punjab, Pakistan. The PIAIP \ntakes  a  holistic  and  integrated  approach  to  improving  sector \nperformance supported through institutional reform with a focus on \nsustainability,  decentralized  management,  transparency,  and \naccountability.  The  PIAIP  will  finance  (i)  comprehensive \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading  (R&U)  of  all  water  resource  and \nirrigation infrastructure; (ii) improved groundwater, conjunctive-use, \nand surface water management strategies and practices; (iii) on-\nfarm water management (OFWM), improved irrigation technologies, \nand agricultural support services; and (iv) sector reforms, improved \nmanagement methods, institutional strengthening and restructuring \nfor  water  resource  management,  and  irrigated  agriculture.  The \nPIAIP is expected to support investments in the (i) Lower Bari Doab \nCanal  and  Balloki  Barrage,  (ii)  Pakpattan  Canal  and  Sulemanki \nBarrage,  (iii)  Thal  Canal  distribution  system,  (iv)  Sidhnai  Canal \ndistribution system, and (v) Trimmu and Punjnad barrages. This will \nimpact between 25% and 30% of the irrigated area in Punjab and \ngiven  the  magnitude  and  duration  of  the  PIAIP,  will  have  a \ntransformative impact on the irrigated agriculture, mainstreaming \nbest practices and institutional reform. \n \nTo  support  implementation  of  the  PIAIP,  a  Punjab  irrigated \nagriculture project preparation facility (PIAPPF) will be developed \nas part of the first project to be funded. The PIAPPF will ensure that \n(i) forthcoming projects are expeditiously prepared to fully utilize \nPIAIP resources, (ii) future projects are well designed and meet \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines, and (iii) the PIAIP is \nwell  managed.  It  will  support  (i)  reconnaissance;  (ii)  feasibility \nstudies;  (iii)  detailed  design  for  the  remaining  PIAIP  projects \nidentified using the selection criteria in the Financial Framework \nAgreement (FFA), schedule 4; and (iv) capacity development for \nproject management and planning. \n \n \n ", "ii   \nThe Lower Bari Doab Canal Improvement Project (LBDCIP), the \nfirst PIAIP project, will define the approach and modalities to be \nused for subsequent PIAIP-supported projects, and therefore define \nthe  primary  activities  to  be  supported  through  the  PIAIP.  Close \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  LBDCIP  will  facilitate  the \nincorporation  of  lessons  into  subsequent  projects.  The  Project \ninvolves the Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) with a 200 kilometer \n(km)-long main canal and more than 1,500 km of associated minor \nand distributary canals that supply irrigation water to more than \n700,000 hectares in central Punjab. The system was built between \n1914 and 1917, and has become an important agricultural area \nserving the markets of Lahore and Multan.  \n \nThe LBDCIP has five components and includes the PIAPPF: \n \n(i)    Component 1: R&U of the Balloki Barrage will (a) allow more \nirrigation  water  to  flow  to  the  LBDC  main  and  Balloki\u2013\nSulemanki link canals, (b) enhance infrastructure safety, and \n(c) mitigate flood risks and impacts. \n(ii)    Component  2:  R&U  of  the  LBDC  distribution  network \n(includes the main, branch, distributary and minor canals, \nand  field  outlets)  will  increase  the  capacity  to  deliver \nirrigation water efficiently, enhance safety, and fully involve \nfarmer organizations in R&U of their particular distributary \nand minor canals as well as help execute civil works. \n(iii)  Component  3:  groundwater  management  will  develop \nmanagement  actions  to  conserve  groundwater,  provide \noptions for conjunctive use, and establish best practices for \nsalinity  and  sodicity  management  to  conserve  land \nresources by (a) supporting farmers\u2019 training through farmer \norganizations  and  the  field  programs  of  the  OFWM \ncomponent (4), (b) establishing a well-drillers training and \ncertification program, and (c) supporting provincial initiatives \non groundwater management. \n(iv)  Component 4: on farm water management and  agriculture \nwill develop a field program in every farmer organization \narea  to  demonstrate  (a)  improved  field  channel  layouts \nresulting in improved irrigation efficiencies; (b) alternative \nwater  application  technologies  and  other  management \ntechniques optimizing the unit productivity of water; (c) laser \ncontrolled land leveling; and (d) conjunctive-use strategies, \nparticularly in saline groundwater areas.  \n(v)  Component  5:  institutional  strengthening  and  operation \nmodernization  will  (a)  support  formation  of  farmer \norganizations  to  be  responsible  for  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the distributary and minor canals; (b) \nform  irrigation  management  units  to  support  farmer \norganizations  in  undertaking  O&M  and  engineering, \ngroundwater  management,  OFWM  support,  agricultural \nsupport  services,  and  administration  and  financial \nmanagement;  (c)  support  analysis  of  LBDC\u2019s  operation \n ", "  iii\nprocedures,  assets,  financial  flows,  staffing,  and  other \nmanagement  concerns  as  the  basis  for  an  operation \nmodernization strategy for improved management; and (d) \nsupport  decentralized  management  of  LBDC  and  its \ntransition  to  an  area  water  board  (AWB)  governed  by  a \nboard with farmer representation. \n   \nRationale  Irrigated  agriculture  in  Punjab  (i)  accounts  for  28%  of  Punjab\u2019s \ngross domestic product (GDP) output, (ii) employs 54% of the labor \nforce, (iii) produces 90% of Punjab\u2019s agricultural output, and (iv) \nuses more than 95% of the water resources. Punjab\u2019s agricultural \nGDP is 66% of the national agricultural GDP. Irrigated agriculture is \ncrucial  to  generating  higher  incomes  and  attaining  Punjab\u2019s \ntargeted  6%\u20137%  growth  rate.  The  Punjab  Irrigation  and  Power \nDepartment (PIPD) is responsible for O&M, and management of \nsurface  irrigation  that  covers  8.4  million  hectares.  PIPD\u2019s \ninfrastructure has an estimated replacement value of $20 billion and \nincludes  13  barrages,  6,429  km  of  main  canals,  31,214  km  of \ndistributary and minor canals, more than 58,000 field outlets, 3,228 \nkm of flood embankments, and 33 small dams. \n \nThe infrastructure has seriously deteriorated due to (i) age (much is \nnearly 100 years old), (ii) no asset management planning, and (iii) \nchronic underfunding and ineffective implementation of O&M. The \nestimated  cost  of  deferred  maintenance  is  about  $2  billion;  the \nestimated cost to upgrade the system to modern standards is $3.5 \nbillion.  The  poor  condition  of  some  large  infrastructure  poses \nserious risks, yet the deteriorated system more generally means \nunreliable irrigation service delivery, particularly to the tail ends of \nthe canals. Farmers have adapted to unreliable and inadequate \ncanal water by developing private tubewells. \n \nDue to (i) lack of reliable flow measurement devices, (ii) inadequate \nmobility and communication of staff, and (iii) no accountability for \naccurate reporting of measurements currently taken, the monitoring \nof  water  distribution  is  weak.  System  operation  is  based  on \nantiquated  modalities  not  employing  technically  advanced \ncontemporary  management  tools.  Staffing  levels,  positions,  and \nskills  mix  need  to  be  updated  to  complement  improved \ninfrastructure  and  optimized  operational  procedures  introduced. \nPIPD has nearly 50,000 employees who account for more than 65% \nof the annual O&M budget; many professional staff lack incentives \nor a dynamic career path and receive compensation considerably \nbelow private sector norms.  \n \nFarmers are dissatisfied with the irrigation service delivery. They (i) \nhave  not  been  involved  with  system  O&M,  management,  or \ngovernance; (ii) are poorly informed of irrigation scheduling and \nsystem  operation;  (iii)  see  little  effect  of  their  irrigation  fees  in \nsystem  improvement;  (iv)  experience  little  accountability  and \ntransparency on behalf of PIPD staff; (v) have no assurances with \n ", "iv   \nregard  to  the  standard  of  service  delivery;  and  (vi)  have  little \nrecourse for grievance redress. Due to this situation, some farmers \ntake more than their share of water, tamper with canals to their \nadvantage, and disregard other rules. Institutional changes that (i) \nimprove transparency and accountability; (ii) align system operation \nwith  user  needs;  and  (iii)  give  users  control  over  systems \nmanagement are needed, along with improved infrastructure and \noperating procedures to achieve maximum improvement in service \ndelivery and agricultural productivity. \n \nPrivate  tubewells  provide  over  half  the  irrigation  water  in  some \nLBDC areas. Yet their rampant, uncontrolled growth compounded \nby poor drilling has led to falling water tables and associated water \nquality  problems  from  migration  of  saline  and  sodic  water  into \nsweet-water areas. Use of low-quality groundwater has led to soil \nsalinity and sodicity, and consequent low-crop yields, particularly in \ncanal tail reaches. In Punjab, most groundwater recharge originates \nfrom the surface irrigation system, so management of groundwater \nand surface water needs to be undertaken conjunctively from both \nquantity and quality perspectives. The layout of water courses and \nfield channels is inefficient. In many cases, the problem is made \nmore complex through the use of the surface water field channels to \nconvey groundwater.  \n \nThe  Government  of  Punjab,  with  support  from  the  World  Bank, \ninitiated the Punjab Irrigation Sector Reform Program based on the \nfollowing four pillars: (i) policy reforms to improve irrigation O&M \nand  financial  and  asset  management;  (ii)  water  resource \nmanagement  reforms  to  improve  allocation,  transparency,  and \nimproved  groundwater  management;  (iii)  reforms  to  improve \nirrigation  quality,  efficiency,  and  accountability  through  greater \nfarmer participation; and (iv) reforms to encourage introduction of \nefficient  and  productive  irrigation  technologies.  Effective \nimplementation of these reforms requires capacity development and \nstrategies for their operationalization at the irrigation system level. \n \nThe Punjab Irrigation and Drainage Authority (PIDA) Act (passed \n1997)  establishes  (i)  farmer  organizations  to  manage  the \ndistributary and minor canals, and collect and retain a share of the \nirrigation fees for O&M, and (ii) AWBs to manage irrigation systems \nand be governed by a board of farmer members. Initial progress of \nthe reforms was slow in Punjab; however, since 2003 85 farmer \norganizations  and  two  AWBs  have  been  formed.  PIPD  has \ncommitted to the establishment of 100 more farmer organizations \nand two additional AWBs. The experience has been positive with \nstrong farmer organizations and improved fee collection and O&M, \nalthough a stronger institutional framework is needed to reinforce \nthe process. \n \nConditions are favorable for continued sector reform as (i) Punjab \nhas meaningful reform under way in many sectors and has strong \n ", "  v\neconomic growth; (ii) the current Government of Punjab is providing \nstrong  leadership  for  reforms  and  sector  investment;  (iii)  the \nGovernment of Punjab is focusing on the irrigated agriculture and \nwater resource sectors; and (iv) ADB, Japan Bank for International \nCooperation, and World Bank are actively engaged in irrigation and \nwater  resources  and  aid  coordination  around  a  common  reform \nagenda. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  PIAIP  will  result  in  economic  growth  and  increased \nsustainability  of  water  and  land  resources  through  improved \nmanagement  of  Punjab\u2019s  water  resources  and  increased \nproductivity  of  irrigated  agriculture.  The  outcomes  include  (i) \nphysical R&U of irrigation infrastructure, (ii) improved practices and \nstrengthened institutional frameworks for ground and surface water \nmanagement,  (iii)  modernized  irrigation  management  systems \noperation  and  procedures,  (iv)  reformed  and  restructured \ninstitutions for water resources management and irrigation service \ndelivery, (v) improved financial management and sustainability, and \n(vi) capacity development to support management and institutional \nchanges. \n   \nProgram Investment  The overall investment plan for the irrigated agriculture sector in \nPlan   Punjab is estimated at $3.5 billion. The investment cost of the PIAIP \nto  be  financed  by  ADB  under  the  PIAIP  is  $900  million.  The \nestimated cost of the LBDCIP, the first project under the PIAIP is \n$281.4 million, including taxes and duties of $15.5 million. \n   \nMultitranche Financing  The Pakistan Government asked ADB to extend financing of $900 \nFacility  million over 10 years through a multitranche financing facility (MFF). \nThis  financing  represents  about  26%  of  the  total  financing \nrequirements envisaged under the investment plan over the next \ndecade.  The  ADB  funding  covers  physical  and  nonphysical \ninterventions. Individual periodic financing requests (PFRs) will be \nconverted  into  individual  or  separate  loans.  The  national \nGovernment and the Government of Punjab have entered into an \nFFA with ADB. Pursuant to the FFA, the Government submitted the \nfirst  PFR  for  $227.8  million  equivalent  to  ADB,  comprising  two \nloans:  (i)  $217.8  million  equivalent  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources, and (ii) $10 million equivalent in Special Drawing Rights \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund). \nThe first PFR is presented to the Board for information together with \nthe FFA. Prior to ADB acceptance of a PFR, ADB will ensure that \nthe Government and the Government of Punjab comply in full with \nthe terms and conditions of the FFA. ADB teams will conduct due \ndiligence on these to ensure they are being satisfactorily adhered \nto. The minimum amount of each individual PFR or loan request at \nany one time will not be less than $50 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan  An MFF of up to $900 million equivalent will provide loans for (i) up \nto an aggregate of $890 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources (OCR) under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n ", "vi   \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, and (ii) up to $10 million equivalent \nin  Special  Drawing  Rights  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Fund  resources. \nEach  loan  will  be  extended  to  finance  projects  subject  to \nsubmission of related PFRs by the Government. The Government \nintends to finance the PIAIP with the submission of at least four \nPFRs. The last loan is expected to be executed no later than 31 \nDecember 2015. \n \nFinancing Plan \n($ million)a \n \n     \nSource  Total ($)  Share (%) \nAsian Development Bank  900  26 \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation  400  11 \nWorld Bank  600  17 \nOthers  100  3 \nGovernments of Punjab and Pakistan   200  6 \nTo be identified  1,300  37 \n  Total  3,500  100 \na  The figures reflect approximate values based on ongoing projects and those in \nthe  pipeline.  In  the  case  of  World  Bank  and  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation (JBIC), $300 million to $400 million is proposed as budget support \nto the Punjab government under development policy loans linked to sector \nreforms. The category \u201cOthers\u201d refers to a proposed JICA grant of $40 million \nand other assumed bilateral grant cofinancing to the sector including Dutch \nfunding for the Lower Bari Doab Canal Improvement Project. These figures for \nthe sector needs and estimated financing are being updated as part of Punjab \nIrrigation  and  Power  Department\u2019s  asset  management  plan  currently  being \nundertaken as a part of Punjab irrigation. \n   \nAllocation and  All loans from OCR and the Special Funds resources will be onlent \nRelending Terms  by the Government to the Government of Punjab at the same terms \nand conditions as those of the ADB loans to the Government. The \nGovernment of Punjab will bear the foreign exchange risk for all \nloans. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  31 March 2007 to 30 September 2017 \n   \nEstimated Program  31 March 2017 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Punjab Irrigation and Power Department (PIPD) \n   \nImplementation  The Project Steering Committee chaired by the chairman of the \nArrangements  Planning and Development Board of the Government of Punjab will \nprovide oversight and policy guidance for the PIAIP, LBDCIP, and \nall  subsequent  projects.  An  investment  program  planning  and \nmanagement  unit  (IPPMU)  will  be  established  within  PIPD\u2019s \nStrategic Planning Cell that will (i) have responsibility for overall \nPIAIP management and coordination; (ii) support individual project \nmanagement  units  (PMUs)  for  PIAIP  projects;  (iii)  manage \npreparation and detailed design of projects under the PIAIP; and \n ", "  vii\n(iv) monitor, evaluate, and report on PIAIP activities. \n \nFor  the  LBDCIP,  PIPD  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The \nimplementing agencies will be (i) Punjab Irrigation and Drainage \nAuthority  (PIDA)  for  farmer  organization  formation  and  capacity \nbuilding,  and  (ii)  Directorate  of  On-Farm  Water  Management \n(DOFWM)  of  the  Department  of  Agriculture  for  the  OFWM  and \nagriculture component. A PMU will be established in Lahore with \nthree divisional project implementation units throughout the LBDC. \nThe PMU will be headed by a project director, supported by three \nPIPD  departmental  directors.  The  PMU  will  (i)  recruit  all \nconsultants; (ii) supervise the design and construction supervision \nconsultants, and process payments on all contracts; (iii) coordinate \nand  monitor  the  civil  works;  (iv)  ensure  that  project  works  are \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies;  (v) \nsupervise  project  groundwater  management,  OFWM,  and \nagriculture initiatives; and (vi) undertake financial management. \n   \nProcurement  All procurement under the PIAIP and LBDCIP will be undertaken \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended \nfrom time to time). A procurement plan will be prepared for each \nproject under the MFF. \n   \nConsulting Services  All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \nThe  Government  of  Punjab  has  requested  ADB  agreement  for \nadvance contracting with respect to recruitment of consultants for \nthe  LBDCIP  and  has  requested  ADB  to  consider  approval  of \nretroactive financing for the consultants. The Government of Punjab \nhas been advised that (i) procedures for advanced contracting are \nnormally used for recruitment of consultants; however, the contract \nis  not  signed  prior  to  signing  of  the  loan;  and  (ii)  approval  of \nadvanced contracting and retroactive financing does not commit \nADB  to  finance  the  loan  project  or  recruitment  costs. \nNongovernment organizations may be contracted or subcontracted \nto  support  resettlement  activities.  Retroactive  financing  in \nsubsequent tranches of the MFF for eligible expenditures, excepting \ncivil works, may be considered and allowed by management if the \nrequest is indicated in a PFR.  \n   \n ", "viii  \nProject Benefits and  The  greatest  benefit  is  improved  agricultural  production  from \nBeneficiaries  increased  yields,  greater  cropping  intensity,  and  some \ndiversification into high-value crops. Improved water supply from \nthe system R&U is responsible for this, and the majority of the \nPIAIP  benefits  are  expected  to  stem  from  improved  irrigation \nleading to increased agricultural productivity. The R&U will increase \nsafe distribution capacity from a current maximum capacity of about \n248  cubic  meters  a  second  (cumecs)  to  278  cumecs  for  the \nLBDCIP. The analysis takes into account that farmers at the tail end \nof  canals,  who  have  poorer  access  to  canal  water  and  more \nfrequently rely on low quality groundwater, will benefit more from \nthe  Project,  while  those  at  the  head  end  with  better  canal  and \ngroundwater supply will benefit less. This has important productivity \nand equity implications. Crops yields are anticipated to increase \nfrom  about  2%  to  7%  depending  on  the  existing  crop  water \nrequirement deficits, with cotton, wheat, and sugarcane seeing the \nhighest gains. Cropping intensity throughout the LBDCIP area is \nanticipated  to  increase  by  about  10%  to  an  annual  average  of \n172%, which will be driven by demographic pressures and further \nfarm fragmentation. The Project, through the OFWM and agriculture \ncomponent, will help accelerate diversification to high-value crops \nwithin the LBDC.  \n \nThe LBDCIP will help mitigate the risk and damage from floods from \nthe  Balloki  Barrage  and  its  associated  infrastructure  and  from \nrehabilitation of the LBDC main canals, which have several sections \nprone to breaching. This infrastructure R&U and development will (i) \nensure that the water supply to the rehabilitated LBDC and the \ncropping areas supplied by the Balloki\u2013Sulemanki Link Canal is \nsecure, (ii) pass moderate floods through a new spillway reducing \nthe needs to breach upstream levies and inundate adjacent areas \nas is the current practice, and (iii) construct two bridges to allow \ntraffic  to  pass  during  and  following  flood  events.  R&U  and \ndevelopment under the PIAIP is expected to provide similar benefits \nfor  barrages  and  other  large  infrastructure.  More  than  half  the \n450,000 farms in the LBDC are less than 2 hectares: for farmers \nwith  less  than  1  hectare,  the  Project  will  yield  an  11%  rise  in \nincome. As a whole, about 275,000 farm families or almost 2 million \npeople will benefit from the LBDCIP. The overall Project provides \nan economic internal rate of return of 19.2% and a financial internal \nrate of return of 16.1%. \n \nThe institutional changes supported by the Project will also provide \nimportant benefits including (i) more sustainable O&M; (ii) improved \nmonitoring, measurement, and management of water distribution; \nand  (iii)  irrigation  service  delivery  that  is  more  responsive  to \nfarmers\u2019 needs. \n \n ", "  ix\nRisks and  Commitment to Reform. The Government of Punjab has shown its \nAssumptions  commitment to reform through development of the Punjab Irrigation \nSector Reform Program as well as through on the ground action \nand establishment of farmer organizations and AWBs. The MFF \nensures long-term engagement by ADB with multiple projects to \nwork with the Government of Punjab to evaluate and strengthen \nsector reforms. \n \n  Robust Farmer Organizations. Development of effective farmer \norganizations  to  support  sustainable  O&M  is  key  to  the  project \noutcome. To ensure effective farmer organizations, the Project will \nsupport (i) comprehensive training, (ii) facilities and equipment to \nbolster  farmer  organization  capacity,  (iii)  irrigation  management \nunits  to  ensure  requisite  technical  support  for  O&M,  and  (iv) \nallocation of an increased abiana (irrigation service fee) share if \nneeded to ensure financial sustainability for farmer organizations.  \n \nUtilization of Funds. To address the risk that program funds will \nnot  be  fully  or  effectively  utilized,  provision  is  provided  for  (i) \nestablishment of a dedicated IPPMU for project preparation, (ii) the \nPIAPPF with detailed terms of reference to prepare subsequent \nPIAIP  projects  supported  by  $10  million  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Fund, (iii) a dedicated PMU for each project, and (iv) \nthe  MFF  modality,  which  allows  IPPMU  and  PMU  staff  to  gain \nexperience from each project undertaken so that implementation \nwill improve as the program progresses. \n \n \n \n \n ",

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  the  Punjab  Irrigated \nAgriculture Investment Program. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Water  resources  and  irrigated  agriculture  are  vital  to  Punjab,  and  their  improved \nmanagement and productivity are fundamental to continued economic development. Irrigated \nagriculture (i) accounts for 28% of Punjab\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) output, (ii) employs \n54% of the labor force, (iii) produces 90% of agricultural output, and (iv) uses over 95% of the \nwater resources. Punjab provides about 58% of the national GDP, and 66% of the national \nagricultural GDP. Irrigated agriculture is crucial to generating higher incomes and attaining the \ntargeted 6%\u20137% growth rate for Punjab (Appendix 2). The Midterm Development Framework of \nthe Government of Punjab identifies the total outlay for the irrigation sector at $142 million in \n2006/07, a 21% increase over the sector\u2019s allocation for 2005/06 and accounts for 13% of the \ncore Annual Development Program for Punjab (2006/07). The projected outlays for the sector in \n2007/08 and 2008/09 are $200 million and $267 million, reflecting annual increases of 41% and \n33% (includes both foreign and domestic sources of funds). \n \n3.  The Indus River canal irrigation system in Pakistan, of which about 56% lies in Punjab, is \nthe  largest  contiguous  irrigation  system  in  the  world.  The  Punjab  Irrigation  and  Power \nDepartment (PIPD) is responsible for operation and maintenance (O&M) and management of the \nsurface irrigation system in Punjab and is the primary agency concerned with water resource \nmanagement. Irrigated agriculture covers a gross command area of 9.5 million hectares (ha), \nand has a cultivable command area of 8.4 million ha (Table 1). This extensive infrastructure was \ninitially developed under the British, with a later significant development thrust under the Indus \nBasin Program during the 1960s, and provides the foundation for irrigated agriculture in Punjab. \nThe  replacement  value  of  government-owned  irrigation  and  water  resources  management \ninfrastructure in Punjab is about $20 billion.1 \n \nTable 1: Key Infrastructure of the Punjab Irrigation Systems \n \nInfrastructure  Quantity  \nHeadworks/Barrages  13  \nMain Canal Systems  24\u20136,429 kilometers (km) \nDistributary and Minor Canals  2,794\u201331,214 km. \nTotal Off-Take Capacity and Field Outlets  3,399 m3/sec; 58,000 total \nGross Command Area  9.45 million ha \nCultivable Command Area  8.41 million ha \nOff-Take Capacity and Length of Link Canals  3,115 m3/sec; 850 km \nTubewells  3,544 \nLength of Surface Drains  9,856 km \nLength of Flood Embankments  3,228 km \nSmall Dams  33 \nha = hectare, km = kilometer, m3/sec = cubic meters/second. \nSource: Punjab Irrigation Sector Reform Program (Punjab Irrigation and Power Department), March 2006. \n \n                                                 \n1  This does not include Chasma, Mangla, and Tarbela dams, watercourses, or private investment in tubewells. \n ", "2 \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n4.  Increased Demand. Irrigated agriculture in Punjab is constrained by both technical and \ninstitutional  factors.  Population  growth  and  farm  fragmentation  has  resulted  in  significantly \nincreased cropping intensities, driving demand for irrigation water far beyond the original design \ncapacity. The systems were initially designed for low cropping intensities of 60%\u201380% with \nassumed  fallow  land.  Current  annual  cropping  intensity  in  Punjab  is  122%  and  in  more \nproductive systems such as the Lower Bari Doab Canal, it may reach 200% in some areas. This \nhas led to increasing water supply shortfalls that are exacerbated during drought and because \nPakistan has lost nearly 30% in its Indus Basin water storage due to reservoir sedimentation. \n \n5.  In the immediate future, kharif season irrigation supplies could become greater as global \nclimate change melts glaciers, which currently provide regular flows to the Indus River. However, \nin  the  longer  term,  shortages  will  become  more  severe  as  glaciers  recede  and  higher \ntemperatures result in increased evaporation from storage reservoirs and higher crop water \nrequirements. Under this scenario, groundwater recharge and sustainable aquifer yields will also \ndecrease.  Surface  and  groundwater  pollution  is  an  increasing  problem  with  little  effective \nregulation resulting in untreated industrial and municipal effluent discharged into rivers and \nsurface  drains,  contaminating  surface  water,  and  potentially  rendering  the  underlying \ngroundwater unfit for potable use. \n \n6.  Irrigation  Infrastructure  Deterioration.  While  the  irrigation  and  water  management \ninfrastructure has provided a seminal development change for Punjab, the condition of much of \nthe infrastructure has seriously deteriorated due to (i) age (much is nearly 100 years old), (ii) lack \nof asset management planning, and (iii) serious underfunding and ineffective implementation of \nO&M. In 2006, PIPD conducted an inventory of irrigation infrastructure assets to develop a \nmanagement plan to comply with the recently approved Punjab Irrigation Sector Development \nPolicy loan.2 The infrastructure needs significant investment, and the estimated cost of deferred \nmaintenance is about $2 billion. To rehabilitate and upgrade the system and its structures for \nenhanced water management, efficiency, and equity, the cost is estimated at $3.5 million. The \npoor condition of some large infrastructure including barrages and main canals poses failure \nrisks and potential civil damage. In most instances, the deteriorated system condition translates \nto unreliable irrigation service delivery, particularly at the tail ends of the canals. Farmers have \nadapted to unreliable surface water irrigation supply by installing private tubewells to increase \nreliability and augment surface water supplies to meet crop demands. \n \n7.  Financial Constraints. Abiana (irrigation service fees) to farmers have not kept pace \nwith inflation and O&M assistance is needed for distributary and minor canal networks, which are \nmore prone to rapid degradation.3 In addition, a low percentage of abiana is collected due to \npoor service delivery, and inefficient arrangements and lack of incentives for collection. The \ndistrict revenue department collects abiana as part of the general revenue, rather than allowing it \nto be retained for canal O&M. This lack of relationship between collection and allocation of funds \nfor O&M compounds farmers\u2019 unwillingness to pay (in addition to poor service delivery). PIPD is \ncurrently  reviewing  the  system\u2019s  O&M  requirements  and  comparing  them  with  budgetary \nallocations to assess the adequacy of the budget. A thorough analysis of all financial flows and \nexpenditure requirements is needed to (i) collect information regarding O&M requirements at all \noperational levels of the system; (ii) provide a basis to guide decision making for improved \ncollection, allocation, and expenditure; and (iii) quantify the benefits to be gained through sector \nreform and institutional change. \n                                                 \n2  The loan, which provides budget support, was approved on 1 June 2006 for $100 million, and is the first of three \ntranches that will be processed as individual loans, with the next loan anticipated for approval in 2007.  \n3  The collection rates are declining; currently only about 47% of the assessed abiana is estimated to be collected. \n ", "3 \n \n8.  Irrigation  Management  Concerns.  The  measurement  and  monitoring  of  water \ndistribution is constrained by (i) degraded canal conditions and lack of recalibration of flow \nmeasurement facilities, (ii) lack of design of many structures to accurately measure variable \nflows, (iii) lack of mobility and communications of staff, and (iv) lack of accountability of accurate \nreporting. System operation is based on antiquated modalities and does not take advantage of \ntechnically  advanced  management  information  systems  (MIS),  improved  communications, \nsimulation software, and other contemporary management tools that could increase irrigation \nefficiency and equity. PIPD has nearly 50,000 employees who account for more than 65% of the \nannual O&M budget. PIPD professional staff lack incentives and a dynamic career path, and \nreceive  compensation  considerably  below  private  sector  norms.  Staffing  levels,  position \ndescriptions, and skills mix need to be updated. PIPD\u2019s ability to improve system efficiency and \nequity of water distribution could be greatly enhanced by (i) irrigation structures that increase the \nability  to  measure  and  manage  water  distribution,  (ii)  optimized  operational  procedures \nsupported with the new technology, and (iii) fewer but better trained staff. \n \n9.  The current situation has led to farmer dissatisfaction. Farmers (i) have not been involved \nwith irrigation system O&M, management, or governance; (ii) are poorly informed about irrigation \nscheduling and perceive the system is not operated in response to their irrigation needs, (iii) see \nlittle effect of their abiana on system O&M, (iv) experience little accountability and transparency \non behalf of PIPD staff, (v) have no assurances about service delivery standards, and (vi) have \nlittle recourse for grievance redress. Thus some farmers take more than their share of water, \ntamper with the canals to their advantage, and disregard rules. Institutional changes that (i) \nimprove transparency and accountability, (ii) align system operation with user needs, and (iii) \ngive users control over systems and governance at all levels are needed along, with improved \ninfrastructure and operating procedures to achieve maximum improvement in service delivery.  \n \n10.  Groundwater and Conjunctive Use. Private tubewells provide excellent flexibility for \ncritical watering and supplemental irrigation water; and provide half the supply in some systems. \nYet their uncontrolled growth has led to overexploitation of groundwater and falling water tables \nin many areas.4 This also leads to water quality problems from lateral migration of saline water \ninto sweet-water zones. Indiscriminate use of low-quality groundwater adversely affects soil \nquality and productivity, particularly in tail reaches of canals where reliance on groundwater is \nhigher due to shortage of canal supplies. Many areas suffer from secondary soil salinity and \nsodicity, and consequently crop yields are low. In the Punjab irrigation systems, almost all \ngroundwater  recharge  originates  from  the  surface  irrigation  system,  so  management  of \ngroundwater and surface water needs to be undertaken conjunctively from both quantity and \nquality perspectives. Likewise, farmers use both surface and groundwater for irrigation, often \nblending brackish groundwater with high-quality canal water. They need information on options \nto optimize conjunctive use and sustainably manage both groundwater and land resources. \n \n11.  On-Farm Water Management. Distribution and field application of water below the canal \noutlet provides an opportunity to improve productivity and sustainable management of land and \nwater resources. The layout of water courses and field channels is often inefficient; the problem \nis  made  more  complex  through  the  use  of  the  surface  water  field  channels  to  convey \ngroundwater. Farm distribution systems need to be designed to take advantage of both water \nsources  to  support  conjunctive-use  objectives.  Laser  land  leveling  and  improved  irrigation \napplication techniques tailored  to  crop,  soil, and  growing  conditions  would  greatly  increase \nirrigation efficiency. Similarly, improved irrigation technology such as drip and sprinkler systems \nshow tremendous promise to increase productivity and water use efficiency of high-value crops. \n                                                 \n4  In many cases, wells may be drilled and constructed improperly, resulting in inefficient operation and increased \nsalinity. \n ", "4 \n \nC.  Institutional Reform and Lessons Learned \n12.  Framework for Sector Reform. Reform in the irrigated agriculture sector in Punjab is \nmoving forward. The irrigation sector vision set forth in Punjab\u2019s Vision 2020 (from the Midterm \nDevelopment Framework) is to \u201cprovide adequate, equitable and reliable irrigation supplies to the \ncultivable  lands  of  Punjab,  aiming  at  enhanced  agricultural  productivity  and  sustainable \ndevelopment with focus on holistic management and broad based reforms.\u201d The Government of \nPunjab has initiated the Punjab Irrigation Sector Reform Program (PISRP), which is supported \nby the World Bank\u2019s Punjab Irrigation Sector Development Policy loan and a corresponding \npolicy  matrix  with  comprehensive  policy  actions.  The  PISRP  is  based  on  four  pillars:  (i) \ninstitutional and policy reforms to improve irrigation system management and O&M to ensure \nlong-term physical and financial sustainability; (ii) water resource management reforms to make \nwater allocation and distribution more transparent and improve groundwater management; (iii) \nreforms  to  improve  irrigation  service  quality,  efficiency,  and  accountability  through  greater \nparticipation of farmers and institutional reforms; and (iv) reforms to encourage introduction of \ntechnology to improve water use efficiency and on-farm productivity. Adoption of these reforms \nrequires capacity development and effective implementation strategies at the system level. \n \n13.  Institutional Change. The Punjab Irrigation and Drainage Authority (PIDA) Act (July \n1997)  (i)  established  PIDA  as  a  separate  entity  from  PIPD  for  decentralized  irrigation \nmanagement; and (ii) provided for (a) farmer organizations to manage the distributary and minor \ncanals, and collect and retain a share of abiana for O&M, and (b) area water boards (AWBs) to \nmanage main canal irrigation systems and be governed by a board of directors with farmer \nmembers. The formation of PIDA and associated institutional changes were part of reforms \nassociated with the National Drainage Program (NDP), a multi-provincial project funded by ADB, \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and World Bank (Appendix 3 presents external \nassistance  to  the  sector).  Initial  progress  of  the  NDP  reforms  was  limited;  no  farmer \norganizations or AWBs were established. However, since 2003 in the Lower Chenab Canal \n(LCC) East, 85 farmer organizations have been formed and an AWB established as part of an \nirrigation rehabilitation project financed under the NDP.5 PIPD has also committed to establish \n100 more farmer organizations and two additional AWBs in 2006/07 as part of the PISRP.6 As of \n2006,  the  experience  of  farmer  organizations  in  the  LCC  has  been  positive,  with  higher \ncollections for abiana and improved management and O&M of the distributary and minor canal. \nHowever, the AWB in the LCC plays an advisory role with no farmer representation yet, and \nPIPD still maintains management of the rest of the system. Although significant progress is being \nmade, a strengthened institutional and legal framework for farmer organizations and higher level \nreforms for decentralized management would support the process.7 \n \n14.  Conditions  for  Reform.  International experience indicates that current conditions in \nPakistan support advancement of institutional reform and their progress can be accelerated \nthrough ADB support that builds on lessons from Pakistan and globally. Reform in a single sector \nis more likely to succeed in the context of overall reform, and Punjab is presently in a much more \nprogressive state, with meaningful reform under way in key sectors with far stronger economic \n                                                 \n5  The LCC East project is financed by JBIC. It was initiated using NDP funds during the latter stages of the NDP in \n2002 with the condition of farmer organizations being formed as a requirement for civil works. In 2006 JBIC started \nthe LCC West project under separate funding. \n6  Notification to form farmer organizations and establish an AWB in the Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) was given on \n11 July 2006, specifying the PIPD superintending engineer for the LBDC Circle as its chief executive officer. \n7  The Government of Punjab has committed to (i) development of a strengthened irrigation management transfer \nagreement and amended rules for farmer organizations and AWBs for the Government of Punjab\u2019s consideration by \n30 June 2008, and (ii) development of options for sources of legal authority for farmer organizations independent of \nPIDA or the PIDA Act to be submitted for consideration to the Provincial Assembly by 31 December 2008. \n ", "5 \nperformance than during the NDP. Current political leadership in the Government of Punjab is \nproviding a catalytic dynamism for reforms with focused attention on investment and improved \nproductivity of the irrigated agriculture and water resources sectors. Importantly, the Government \nof Punjab through the PISRP is leading the reform effort with on the ground action. PIPD is \neffectively coordinating the support of ADB, JBIC, and World Bank around a common reform \nagenda; continued development partner engagement will help keep the reform process moving \nforward. \n \n15.  Lessons Learned. In addition to the less favorable climate for reform, the NDP faced \nchallenges relating to implementation and design. As an umbrella project, the NDP attempted to \ninstitute reforms throughout the country instead of exerting more focused effort in a targeted area \nor province. The NDP included civil works, but did not provide a comprehensive rehabilitation \nprogram  carried  out  with  appropriate  farmer  involvement  targeted  at  turning  over  fully \nrehabilitated  and  upgraded  distributary  and  minor  canals for  farmer  management.  Capacity \ndevelopment  and  institutional  change  for  farmer  organizations  and  the  provincial  irrigation \ndepartments were new activities under the NDP and consultant recruitment to support these \nefforts  was  significantly  delayed.  Currently,  PIDA  is  directly  engaged  in  forming  farmer \norganizations and has a strong mandate to mobilize more. The NDP also did not provide a clear \ntransition strategy for irrigation departments to shift to the new management paradigm nor did it \naddress the details of issues such as staff displacement, staff reporting, financial flows and \nsustainability, or improved management and system operations. \n \n16.  ADB has not been engaged in irrigation lending in Pakistan since the NDP. However, \nADB\u2019s  reengagement  with  irrigated  agriculture  in  Punjab  is  supported  by  recent  sector \ndevelopments  and  current  conditions,  ongoing  sector  reform,  and  a  pragmatic  approach \nsupported by lessons from the NDP and from irrigation reform across Asia: (i) reforms in the \nirrigation sector need to be comprehensive and address interrelated issues simultaneously; (ii) \nreforms require the commitment of affected agencies, and wide commitment and acceptance by \nall  stakeholders;  (iii)  institutional  changes  should  be  implemented  and  reinforced  through \nconcurrent development of physical infrastructure; (iv) capacity building for all institutions and \nstakeholders is essential; (v) development and participation of farmer organizations and farmers \nare  vital  elements  of  reform;  and  (vi)  a  focus  on  project  management  is  essential  to  (a) \nstrengthen administrative capacity for effective implementation, (b) ensure safeguards, and (c) \ndevelop  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems.  ADB\u2019s  experience  with  farmer \norganizations shows that (i) farmer organization development and reform is a long-term process, \n(ii) farmer organizations need to be involved in all aspects of irrigation development (including \nrehabilitation)  and  management  for  sustainable  O&M  and  improved  service  delivery,  (iii) \nexecuting agencies require focused engagement and capacity development to create effective \nfarmer organizations, and (iv) an emphasis on financial resources and O&M is necessary for \nsustainable  improvements.  All  these  factors  support  a  substantial,  sustained  long-term \ninvestment program with linked reforms in irrigated agriculture to support continued economic \ngrowth. The multitranche financing facility (MFF) provides an excellent modality to support this \nlong-term approach and incorporate lessons into project design. From a broader development \nperspective, strong engagement in the water sector in Pakistan is supported by (i) the ADB \nPakistan country strategy and program,8 which identifies water as one of the key areas for \neconomic development; (ii) ADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy II, which lists investment in water \nresources as a core ADB activity; and (iii) the national Government and the Government of \nPunjab, which both identify investment in irrigation and water management as a priority for \nPakistan for economic development and poverty reduction. \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): Pakistan. Manila. \n ", "6 \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n17.  The Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program (PIAIP) will result in economic \ngrowth and improved sustainability of water and land resources. This will be achieved through \nimproved  management  of  Punjab\u2019s  water  resources  and  resulting  increased  productivity  of \nirrigated agriculture. The outcomes from the PIAIP and its investment projects include (i) physical \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading  (R&U)  of  irrigation  infrastructure,  (ii)  improved  practices  and \nstrengthened  institutional  frameworks  for  surface  and  groundwater  management, 9  (iii) \nmodernized  irrigation  management  systems  operation  and  procedures,  (iv)  reformed  and \nrestructured institutions for improved and sustainable irrigation service delivery, and (v) capacity \ndevelopment at all levels to support the management and institutional changes. The approach to \nimplementation of projects supported under the PIAIP is based on integrating components to \nachieve these outcomes. This approach combined with sustained ADB engagement through the \nMFF modality will have a transformative effect on the entire sector. \n \n18.  The PIAIP is based on the principle that physical and nonphysical investments must work \ntogether  for  effective  development  of  the  irrigated  agriculture  sector.  The  PIAIP  will  use \ninfrastructure development as means to achieve policy reform by facilitating meaningful changes \nin practice at the field level. The four pillars of the PISRP (para. 12) provide an excellent basis for \naddressing current problems in irrigated agriculture. The value added of the PIAIP will be to \nimplement PISRP policies along with other institutional reforms at the irrigation system level on a \nwidespread  basis  in  Punjab.  This  requires  development  of  procedures  and  implementation \narrangements, and mandates mobilization of resources to translate recommended policy reforms \ninto action at the farmer level. At the same time, the PIAIP will help support a strengthened legal \nand institutional framework to deepen the reform process. \n \n19.  The PIAIP strategy is to use the activities and modalities developed through preparation \nof the Lower Bari Doab Canal Improvement Project (LBDCIP), the first project investment under \nthe  PIAIP,  as  a  model  for  replication  in  other  canal  systems  within  Punjab.  The  LBDCIP \ncomponents  and  their  implementation  arrangements  will  be  replicated  in  subsequent  canal \nprojects and thus the LBDCIP provides a comprehensive example that defines the PIAIP\u2019s \nactivities and objectives. The program and project staff will closely monitor LBDCIP as a basis \nfor improving design and implementation of successive projects. The MFF modality facilitates \nincorporating lessons identified throughout the PIAIP to enhance development effectiveness. \n \n20.  ADB Special Funds resources are provided with the first tranche as a part of LBDCIP \nfunding  to  establish  the  Punjab  irrigated  agriculture  project  preparation  facility  (PIAPPF)  to \nsupport  timely  preparation  of  the  remaining  investments  under  the  PIAIP.  The  subsequent \nproject investments include the (i) Pakpattan Canal (about 550,000 hectares [ha]) and Sulemanki \nBarrage, (ii) Thal Canal (about 800,000 ha), (iii) Sidhnai Canal (about 330,000 ha), and (iv) \nTrimmu and Punjnad barrages. The second tranche is anticipated to include civil works for the (i) \nPakpattan main canal; (ii) Sulemanki Barrage; (iii) Trimmu Barrage; and (iv) development of \nfarmer organizations in the Pakpattan, Sidhnai, and Thal distribution networks. The third tranche \nis anticipated to include civil works for the majority of the distributary and minor canals in the \n                                                 \n9  The Government of Punjab has committed to (i) a process and framework for multistakeholder discussions to review \nwater sector institutions for management of the water resources and service delivery by 30 April 2007, assessing \nsector concerns including (a) resource management for surface and groundwater, (b) irrigation and drainage service \ndelivery, (c) flood control, (d) water quality, (e) hydropower, and (f) water supply and sanitation among others; and \n(ii) development of an overall water sector road map and action plan with time-bound milestones and action plan in \nplace by 30 April 2009. \n ", "7 \nPakpattan, Sidhnai, and Thal command areas. The fourth tranche is anticipated to include the \nremaining distributary and minor canals and Punjnad Barrage. \n \n21.  The Pakpattan (and Sulemanki Barrage) and Sidhnai canals are similar to the Lower Bari \nDoab Canal (LBDC) and are located adjacent to the LBDC in the Multan Zone of PIPD. Once all \nthese  canals  are  addressed  through  the  PIAIP,  they  will  form  a  large  contiguous  block  of \nirrigation systems with (i) vastly improved infrastructure, (ii) reformed irrigation service delivery \ninstitutions, and (iii) enhanced management and O&M practices that will provide a critical mass \nto facilitate adoption of best practices in other systems. The Thal Canal and Trimmu and Punjab \nbarrages  are  in  urgent  need  of  R&U;  the  PIAIP  will  substantially  improve  the  physical \nperformance and safety of these facilities while supporting institutional reforms for the Thal Canal \nsystem. \n \n22.  The PIAIP outputs will impact between 25% and 30% of the irrigated land in Punjab \n(about 2.3 million ha), starting with the LBDCIP. Due to the investment size and duration of \nsector  engagement  provided  through  the  MFF,  the  PIAIP  will  facilitate  mainstreaming  of \ninstitutional  reforms,  new  modalities  for  service  delivery,  and  improved  water  resource \nmanagement into the irrigated agriculture sector in Punjab.  \n \nB.  Outputs  \n1.  Lower Bari Doab Canal Improvement Project  \n \n23.  The LBDC was built between 1913 and 1917 and is located between Lahore and Multan. \nThe Balloki Barrage on the Ravi River diverts water into the LBDC head regulator and the \nBalloki\u2013Sulemanki Link Canal.10 The LBDC main canal stretches over 200 km and supplies \nwater to about 1,500 km of distributary and minor canals, which feed about 3,500 outlets to \nirrigate over 700,000 ha. Approximately 275,000 farm families derive their livelihoods directly \nfrom crops grown in the LBDC command area including wheat, rice, maize, cotton, sugarcane, \nfodder, flowers, vegetables, and citrus and other orchard crops. LBDC is an important and \nprogressive agricultural area in Punjab and offers significant potential for increased productivity. \nThe LBDCIP takes a holistic view of sector improvement for water resources and irrigated \nagriculture that includes (i) R&U of infrastructure, (ii) improved management of groundwater, (iii) \nimproved practices for on-farm water management (OFWM) and irrigated agriculture; and (iv) \ncapacity  building,  sector  reforms,  and  institutional  strengthening.  The  LBDCIP  contains  the \nfollowing five components along with the PIAPPF.  \n \na.  Component 1: R&U of the Balloki Barrage Complex \n \n24.  The Project will (i) support development of detailed designs and execution of civil works \nfor R&U of Balloki Barrage, the LBDC head regulator, and the Balloki\u2013Sulemanki Link Canal \nhead  regulator;  (ii)  construct  a  spillway  and  associated  bridges  to  mitigate  flood  risks  and \ndamages; and (iii) prior to the civil works, undertake a hydrological analysis to identify upstream \neffects of the Thein Dam in India, and natural and handmade changes to the Ravi River channel \nto guide infrastructure design and system operation (ponding levels, etc.) of the Balloki Barrage, \nwith respect to probabilities and magnitude of flood flows.11 \n \n                                                 \n10  The majority of the Ravi River flows are diverted upstream in India, and only about 5% of the water diverted at \nBalloki annually originates from the Ravi itself. The bulk of the water supply diverted to LBDC at Balloki comes from \nother link canals, which convey water to the barrage from Mangla Reservoir and the Jhelum and Chenab rivers.  \n11  Results of the analysis will be tested with the physical model at the Research Institute at Nandipur. River \nmorphological studies will be conducted to support R&U of the Balloki Barrage Complex. \n ", "8 \n25.  Balloki Barrage. Balloki Barrage will have upstream sediment deposition and a small \nstone-pitched island removed to improve flow. To preclude the recurrence of sedimentation, \nguidewalls will be constructed above and lead to designated clusters of bays on the right side of \nthe barrage, so that each group can be operated independently to route low flood flows through \nthe individual channels created by the guidewalls, transporting sediment downstream of the \nbarrage.  Electomechanical  equipment  will  be  upgraded,  including  installation  of  motors  to \noperate  gates.  The  barrage  R&U  package  will  include  new  piezometers  to  monitor  uplift \npressures, grouting, downstream bank protection, friction blocks to improve energy dissipation, \nrepair to the stone masonry, and strengthening of the downstream apron. \n \n26.  Head Regulators. The Balloki\u2013Sulemanki Link Canal has a water allocation of 694 cubic \nmeters/second (cumecs); however, passing this flow through existing structures poses operating \nrisks. The LBDCIP will support development of an additional head regulator adjacent to the \nexisting head regulator to safely deliver supplies to 694 cumecs. To improve the existing Balloki\u2013\nSulemanki  Link  head  regulator,  the  Project  will  support  grouting  under  the  weir  crest,  an \nadditional sheet pile cutoff downstream, and extension of the stone apron downstream. The \nLBDC head regulator was renovated in the 1960s and requires no structural changes; yet will be \nequipped with motors for gate operation and undergo grouting, plastering, and other remedial \nworks.  \n \n27.  Flood  Improvements.  The  LBDCIP  will  provide  a  concrete  spillway  with  a  design \ncapacity  of  about  1,416  cumecs  adjacent  to  the  right  side  of  the  barrage.  This  will  pass \nintermediate flood flows, reduce the risk of damage to the barrage, and significantly reduce the \nneed to breach the upstream flood levies to inundate local areas during flood events as is the \ncurrent operating procedure. Additional earth works will integrate the spillway into the existing \nriver levy network and ensure flood flows are properly directed to the spillway. The spillway will \nchannel flood flows around the barrage and back to the river. Two vehicle bridges crossing the \nspillway and an auxillary flood channel will be constructed on the right side of the barrage to \ncarry traffic on the Balloki\u2013Faisalbad road that crosses the Ravi River on the Balloki Barrage. \nTogether,  these  measures  safeguard  the  barrage  and  mitigate  resulting  floods  to  both  the \nroadway and adjacent land between the spillway and the river. \n \nb.  Component 2: R&U of the LBDC Canal Network \n \n28.  The entire LBDC system including the main, branch, distributary, and minor canals will \nhave R&U to address deterioration from age and deferred maintenance, and to ensure their \ncapacity to safely distribute the full sanctioned discharge of 278 cumecs at the head of the LBDC \nmain canal.12 An important outcome of the LBDCIP is to significantly upgrade the ability to \nmeasure, monitor, and control canal flows to improve water management and enhance equity \nbetween  the  head  and  tail  of  the  distribution  system.  The  need  for  improved  control  is \nheightened by the marked seasonal fluctuations in water deliveries at the head of the LBDC and \nthe  expanded  command  area.  These  infrastructure  improvements  along  with  improved \nmanagement  methods  using  modern  technology  and  updated  procedures,  and  institutional \nreforms for decentralized management will support significantly improved operation and more \nefficient water use. Two subprojects were prepared to feasibility during project preparation, 15-L \nand Jhandraka distributary canals, which were used to develop the R&U approach for the \ndistributary and minor canals. These two canals will have detailed designs prepared and be \ncontracted immediately at the start of the LBDCIP. \n \n29.  LBDC Main Canal. The LBDC main canal will be excavated, reshaped, and enlarged in \nsome  areas  to  redress  sediment  deposition  and  deterioration  of  the  original  profile,  which \n                                                 \n12  The system was designed in 1914 for a maximum discharge of 248 cumecs to irrigate 570,000 ha.  \n ", "9 \nconstrict capacity and encroach on canal safety. Berms and canal banks will be strengthened, \nespecially in areas prone to breaching, and emergency escape capacity increased. Brick lining \nwill be used rather than widening the earthen section to support the increased flows while \nminimizing land acquisition and disruption to populated areas. \n \n30.  The LBDCIP will rehabilitate numerous main canal structures including 55 distributary \nhead regulators, 20 fall bridges and fall flumes, 14 road bridges, numerous direct off-takes, an \naqueduct, drainage siphons, and other structures. Most new head regulators will be the constant \nhead orifice type that allow easy and accurate flow measurement and improved water control, \nand  are  key  to  improved  management  in  the  upgraded  system. Twenty  existing  brick  and \nmasonry bridges with drops will be replaced with new reinforced concrete structures. Gated \ncross regulation will be incorporated in a number of structures enhancing control in diverting \ndischarges to off-taking canals. Upstream and downstream sections of the fall structures will be \nreplaced and energy dissipation enhanced for improved safety. Except where load and roadway \nwidth requirements have greatly increased, road and footbridges not serving hydraulic functions \nwill be retained and strengthened. New structures crossing the main canal will require temporary \ndiversion of all or part of the main canal flow. Adequate contracting capacity and equipment will \nbe available to ensure that construction activities for the main canal can be completed over two \nto  three  seasons  during  normal  canal  closure  periods  or  extended  closures  with  adequate \nnotification and no impacts. \n \n31.  The Distribution Network. The condition of distributary and minor canals is inferior to \nthe main canal due to high sediment deposition, substantial buffalo trespass, and less assiduous \nmaintenance. Extensive earthworks for reshaping are required in some areas, and buffalo ghats \nwill be constructed.13 Head regulators with higher crests and, where possible, increased canal \ngradients and narrowing of canals will be used to pass sediment loads more effectively to the \nfields. Canal lining will be provided in saline groundwater areas to prevent seepage and to \nsupply  more  canal  water  to  these  farmers  where  fresh  water  is  needed  for  mixing  with \ngroundwater, leaching, and land reclamation. About 20% of the distributary and minor canal \nlength will be lined, using concrete over a geomembrane protected by geotextile. \n \n32.  Structures  for  distributary  and  minor  canals  will  include  gated  constant  head  orifice \nregulators  at  the  head  of  the  channel  and  additional  structures  including  weirs  to  ensure \nequitable distribution and eliminate the need for gate operation. To ensure maximum operating \nefficiency and minimize sediment deposition, discharge through the distributary and minor canals \nwill be maintained at between 80% and 105% of their design discharge. Head regulators in the \nminors will be the constant head orifice type except in tail reaches where flumes will be used at \nthe head of the off-takes due to small discharges. Measurement capacity will be increased \nthrough improved structures at the head of the canal and the use of measuring flumes in the tail \nreaches.  All  outlets  from  the  canals  to  the  field  distribution  network  will  be  replaced  with \nstructures  that  ensure  equitable  distribution  and  adjusted  to  maximize  sediment  passage. \nBridges, village access for washing, and other minor infrastructure throughout the distributary \nand minor canal network will undergo R&U or be newly constructed.14 \n \n33.  R&U and Farmer Organization Participation. A vital project activity is the integration of \nthe institutional development of farmer organizations and their direct involvement in the R&U \nprocess for their particular canal.15 Important outputs from this process include (i) the opportunity \nfor farmer organizations to develop their management capacity and social capital, (ii) a sense of \n                                                 \n13  Buffalo ghats are designated areas for buffalos to wallow to prevent damage to the canal. \n14  In the cases of bridges, washing access areas, and other small canal-related infrastructure in or near villages, \nwomen\u2019s committees will be formed and consulted regarding the location and design of the structures. \n15  No R&U will take place in canals prior to the formation of farmer organizations.  \n ", "10 \nownership over their canal, and (iii) hands-on experience to teach O&M skills for use as they \ntake control to manage the system. The Project will ensure the following farmer organization \nparticipation: (i) farmer organizations will identify and propose civil works on the basis of a \nsystem walk-through with project management unit (PMU) consultant staff; (ii) PMU consultants \nwill carry out surveys and design in consultation with the farmer organizations; and (iii) farmer \norganizations  will  be  part  of  a  PMU  staff  and  PIPD  committee  that  will  facilitate  dialogue, \nfeedback, and if necessary, actions to address the concerns of the farmer organization with the \nR&U. The walk-through will also be used to identify small-scale civil works that are within the \nfarmer  organization\u2019s  capacity  to  execute  under  community  contracting  with  appropriate \nsupervision  as  a  means  of  generating  additional  revenue,  leverage  R&U  resources,  and \ncontribute to farmer organization development. These works will be included in the larger civil \nworks  contracts  for  the  distributary  and  minor  canals.16 Procedures  for  farmer  organization \nparticipation will be refined in the two initial subprojects, 15-L and Jhandraka. \n \nc.  Component 3: Groundwater Management  \n \n34.  The LBDCIP will support a comprehensive approach to groundwater and conjunctive-use \nmanagement that includes (i) improving the knowledge base and research, (ii) policy planning, \n(iii) awareness raising, (iv) targeted interventions and improved practices, and (v) monitoring and \nevaluation. Although data exists from agencies such as the Water and Power Development \nAuthority,  Directorate  of  Land  Reclamation  (under  PIPD),  and  Public  Health  Engineering \nDepartment, it has not been collected regularly with consistent protocols and coordinated under \na single agency. The Project will establish a cell within the PMU to collect, manage, and analyze \ngroundwater data in LBDC starting with compilation of historical data and identification of existing \nmonitoring wells to initiate development of a quality and quantity groundwater model. Additional \nwells that provide water quality samples as a function of depth will be developed as needed to \nenhance the model\u2019s accuracy; this may be supported by other remote sensing or assessment \ntechniques. Wells for controlled pumping tests aimed at quantifying aquifer characteristics will be \nconstructed  at  sites  within  the  LBDC  command.  A  comprehensive  geographic  information \nsystem  database  will  be  developed  to  support  groundwater  management  and  all  project \nactivities.17 Although, the primary groundwater activity will address agriculture water issues, \npotable supply wells will be addressed for monitoring and analysis. An important part of the \nactivity will be to monitor the impacts of project interventions to improve the knowledge base to \nsupport comprehensive groundwater management. \n \n35.  The analysis and modeling of groundwater provide the opportunity to confirm trends in \nwater table fluctuations during and after project implementation to identity areas at risk where \ninterventions are needed. The groundwater component will develop policies and management \nactions for farm and canal command to address agricultural issues, as well as coordinate with \nPIPD\u2019s provincial groundwater management cell and address aquifer and provincial groundwater \nconcerns.18 Due to the size of the LBDC and the number of tubewells, the initial policy approach \nwill be one of awareness and education. An important output of the groundwater component will \nbe to work with the PMU and provincial officials to develop farm strategies and interventions for \ngroundwater  management  and  conjunctive  use  (including  alternative  technologies,  e.g., \n                                                 \n16  The LBDCIP will support a pilot trial for full farmer organization management of civil works in a small and technically \nappropriate minor or distributary canal undergoing R&U later in the Project. The farmer organization participation will \nbe supported by the PMU. This experience could be replicated later under the PIAIP in subsequent canals. \n17  Although the geographic information system will be developed under the groundwater component, the geographic \ninformation system database will be expanded and managed by the PMU as a general management tool for all \nproject activities.  \n18  A provincial groundwater cell within PIPD is being established under the Punjab Irrigation Sector Development \nPolicy loan. \n ", "11 \nskimming wells). These practices and interventions will be (i) demonstrated independently, (ii) \nincorporated into the Project\u2019s field programs under the OFWM and agriculture component, and \n(iii)  disseminated  by  other  stakeholders  and  scaled  up  and  implemented  by  the  irrigation \nmanagement units (IMUs), farmer organizations, and other stakeholders. \n \n36.  Given the rapid growth of tubewells, a pivotal leverage point is the well-drilling industry. \nTechnical drilling specialists will work with the drilling community to observe current practices, \ncreate training programs, develop a certification program, and make recommendations for a \nregulatory framework to govern the drilling industry. Field and classroom training will be provided \nfor drillers and other stakeholders, along with a certification program targeting both drillers and \nfarmers.19 Materials  and  programs  targeted  at  farmers  will  be  developed  to  increase  their \nknowledge of well technology, drilling practices, and the certification program to make them \nbetter informed consumers of drilling services. These materials and a list of certified drillers \nwhere applicable will be distributed through the IMUs, farmer organizations, and other channels. \n \nd.  Component 4: On-Farm Water Management and Agriculture  \n \n37.  The OFWM and agriculture component will ensure that improved water delivery through \ncanal systems is complemented by improved water management at the field level and results in \nhigher agricultural productivity. This component will support development of field programs on \nselected watercourses in the service area of each farmer organization. Each field program will \ninclude a 40 ha area that combines (i) improved field channel layout and operation of the water \ncourse, including application of conjunctive use strategies, particularly in saline groundwater \nareas where mixing or alternating surface and groundwater irrigations is required; (ii) practices \nfor improved application efficiency, scheduling irrigation based on crop water requirements, and \nother management techniques to maximize production per unit volume of irrigation water; and \n(iii) laser leveling. This approach will provide an opportunity for farmers to observe best practice \nand  ensure  a  strong  linkage  between  the  groundwater  component  and  the  OFWM  and \nagriculture component to (i) disseminate conjunctive use strategies, (ii) demonstrate alternative \nirrigation technologies reliant on groundwater, and (iii) monitor impacts. The OFWM activities will \nbe implemented by the Directorate of On-Farm Water Management (DOWFM), a part of the \nDepartment of Agriculture, which will have staff in each of the IMUs. \n \n38.  The component will establish demonstration plots employing drip and sprinkler irrigation \ntechnology within the field program areas. Selection of the field program areas will depend upon \nexisting cropping patterns that can benefit from these technologies and must be targeted at a \nrange of farmers, especially those who can readily adopt these practices. Involvement of private \nsector and other service providers who can work with farmers to develop strategies to scale up \nthese applications will be facilitated through the Project. \n \n39.  The LBDC command area has relatively progressive farmers, a growing percentage of \ndiversified and higher value crops, and good access to markets in Lahore and Multan. The \nLBDCIP will demonstrate the benefits of improved inputs for increased productivity, integrated \npest management techniques, polythene tunnels and seed beds for early vegetable production, \npostharvest activities, and other production and management options. Field program agricultural \nactivities will be developed to provide strategies for saline or sodic soils. They will provide an \nopportunity to observe a range of improved agricultural practices, OFWM and conjunctive-use \nstrategies, and advanced irrigation technologies in a single location throughout the LBDC. The \n                                                 \n19  Findings from project preparation indicate that many wells are spaced inappropriately, completed and screened at \nthe wrong depth with inappropriate perforation size and pattern, constructed using inappropriate materials, and are \ngenerally of poor quality. \n ", "12 \nProject will support farmer and farmer organization exchanges and training courses to help \nensure farmers\u2019 exposure to improved practices and build capacity. \n \ne.  Component 5: Institutional Strengthening and Operation \nModernization \n40.  To  derive  maximum  benefit  from  the  LBDC  system  R&U,  institutional  reforms  and \ncapacity development for irrigation O&M and management are required. The Project will support \n(i) development of farmer organizations and supporting IMUs, (ii) modernized operation and \nmanagement methods, (iii) effective and accountable decentralized management through an \nAWB, and (iv) enhanced capacity for all stakeholders. \n \n41.  Khal Panchayats. At the water course level, the LBDCIP will support development of \nkhal  panchayats,  water  user  associations.  PIDA,  with  support  from  the  PMU  and  project \nconsultants, will develop and implement a mobilization program for the approximately 3,200 \nwater courses in the LBDC.20 The mobilization program will (i) include awareness raising of the \nfarmer  organization  program  objectives,  and  rights  and  responsibilities;  (ii)  identify  khal \npanchayat members and conduct elections for officers; (iii) establish management procedures \nfor khal panchayat officers; and (iv) select a khal panchayat chairperson who will represent the \nkhal  panchayat  in  the  farmer  organization  and  be  responsible  for  khal  panchayat  abiana \ncollection. \n \n42.  Farmer Organizations. Formation of 60 to 70 farmer organizations on the distributary \nand minor canals of the LBDC is a fundamental project output.21 Following mobilization of the \nkhal panchayats and formation of the farmer organizations, a farmer organization management \ncommittee will be formed and intensive training for farmer organization members provided.22 The \nProject  will  fund  establishment  costs  and  office  renovation  for  farmer  organizations;  the \nGovernment of Punjab will provide office space for each farmer organization from existing PIPD \nor  other  Government  of  Punjab  facilities.  The  Project  will  support  development  of  a \ncomprehensive and explicit service agreement between the farmer organizations and AWB that \ntransparently specifies the responsibility, authority, accountability, and actions to be taken should \neither party fail to fulfill its obligations. \n \n43.  Irrigation Management Units. To ensure successful execution of farmer organization \nresponsibilities, IMUs will be developed and supported. The IMUs will report to a committee of \nfarmer organization members they serve and provide requisite professional capacity to manage \nthe  distributary  and  minor  canals.  The  IMUs  will  be  formed  concurrently  with  the  farmer \norganizations, and support farmer organization participation in the minor and distributary R&U to \nfacilitate the process and develop skills to manage the system. The IMUs will respond to needs \nof the khal panchayats and farmer organizations, and provide the following technical services: (i) \nO&M and engineering guidance for minor and distributary canals; (ii) groundwater, conjunctive-\nuse, and OFWM strategies; and monitoring of these activities; (iii) agricultural services; and (iv) \n                                                 \n20  The Project will coordinate efforts and where feasible build upon work already undertaken by the DOFWM, which is \nimplementing the National Program on Watercourse Improvement to improve water courses and field channels. This \nprogram provides legal registration of water user associations often having the same members as the khal \npanchayats.  \n21  The general principle is that farmer organizations will be formed according to hydrologic boundaries and the \naverage size will be about 10,000 ha. However, in very large distributary canals, multiple farmer organizations may \nbe formed along various reaches of the canal with a federated structure for management.  \n22  The farmer organization will have a general body consisting of all the khal panchayats chairpersons and elect a \nmanagement committee consisting of a president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and five executive members \nwith three from the tail reaches. Each farmer organization will develop a communication plan to provide information \nto the khal panchayats. Standing committees for ongoing functions of the farmer organization may be formed, and \nmaintenance plans, financial management plans, and other plans will be developed. \n ", "13 \nadministration and financial management including billing and record keeping for abiana. About \n12  IMUs  will  be  established  in  the  LBDC  command,  each  supporting  six  or  seven  farmer \norganizations. The IMUs will provide the technical interface on behalf of the farmer organizations \nwith the AWB for scheduling, rotation, and other operation and management functions of the \nmain and branch canals that affect delivery to the distributary and minor canals. \n \n44.  The Project will enable IMUs to fulfill their role through training and provision of essential \nequipment, including (i) basic office equipment and computers, (ii) technical equipment for O&M, \n(iii) vehicles, and (iv) communications to ensure responsiveness. The Government of Punjab will \nprovide office space for each IMU from existing PIPD or other Government of Punjab facilities. \nThe  IMUs  will  employ  qualified  technical  staff  dedicated  to  serve  the  farmer  organizations \nachieving economies of scale, precluding the need for each farmer organization to expend \nexcessive funds to support staff for its particular service area.23 IMU staff will be hired by the \nfarmer organizations with PIDA and PMU assistance. Staff will initially be supported with project \nfunds that will eventually decline and be replaced with the farmer organization\u2019s abiana share. \nEach IMU will be assigned a DOFWM officer, who will be responsible for managing the field \nprograms in each the member farmer organization and provide OFWM service within the IMU \nservice area. One PIDA staff member will also serve in the IMU to provide ongoing training and \ncoordination. \n \n45.  Farmer Mobilization and Training. The mobilization of the khal panchayats and farmer \norganizations, and training of the farmer organizations and IMUs will be provided through three \nfarmer organization support offices located at the project implementation units (PIUs). PIDA will \nmaintain a project management office (PMO) in Sahiwal for overall coordination. The farmer \norganization support offices will manage the farmer organization and IMU training program that \nwill include (i) institutional overview, and roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in the irrigation \nsector; (ii) administrative management; (iii) financial management; (iv) water charge assessment \nand billing procedures; (v) system maintenance; (vi) gender; and (vii) system operation and \nwater management. Consultant support will strengthen PIDA\u2019s training and program delivery with \nspecialists  who  have  international  experience.  Training  of  farmer  organizations  will  be \nindependently evaluated including performance-based benchmarking of farmer organizations \nand PIDA. \n \n46.  Operation Modernization and Change Management. For the main canal, the Project \nwill  support  an  analysis  of  all  LBDC  management  and  operation  procedures  to  develop  a \nstrategic  plan  to  transform  the  AWB  for  the  LBDC  into  a  more  efficient  and  responsive \norganization.  The  strategy  will  define  an  operation  and  management  improvement  process \nbased on the principles of decentralization, transparency, accountability, and efficiency. The \ninitial activities will involve analysis of (i) the LBDC AWB\u2019s institutional mandate and activities; (ii) \nall operation procedures including financial management, procurement, O&M, monitoring and \nevaluation, water distribution, and other activities; (iii) current staffing assignments and future \nhuman resource needs in light of the (a) system R&U, (b) updated management procedures, (c) \nthe goal to improve staff capacity and revitalize a culture of corporate professionalism, and (d) \nthe use of improved information technology and MIS; and (iv) financial and asset management.24 \n                                                 \n23  A PIDA study found that an area greater than 40,000 ha is required for a technical manager to be financially viable. \n24  A detailed financial analysis will be undertaken to (i) identify fund flows throughout the system, (ii) assess O&M and \nmanagement costs for existing operation as a basis to estimate rationalized costs for a modernized system at \nvarious management levels (farmer organization/minor distributary; AWB/main and branch canals; and barrages); \n(iii) provide a basis for the equitable share of abiana between farmer organizations; AWB; as well as entities \noperating the barrage, link canals, and Mangla Dam; (iv) make transparent all subsidies for delivery of service; and \n(v) provide a basis for enhanced cost recovery and financial viability of irrigation service delivery. \n ", "14 \nAn  awareness  program  and  staff  participation  will  be  promoted  to  solicit  suggestions,  gain \nacceptance, and provide strategy input.  \n \n47.  Implementation of the Modernization Strategic Plan. Based on the comprehensive \nassessment, a strategic plan will be developed that presents a blueprint for more effective AWB \nmanagement and transition options. The strategic plan will focus on LBDC, yet provide a basis \nfor replication in subsequent canals under the PIAIP. The Project will support implementation of \nthe strategic plan including (i) revised operating procedures and manuals to exploit the new \ninfrastructure and use of information technology and MIS in all aspects of operation, and be \nmore efficient and responsive to fluctuations in water supply and irrigation service demands; (ii) a \nrationalized staffing plan with revised positions and job descriptions, recruitment standards, \ncompensation,  and  redeployment  plan;  (iii)  intensive  capacity  development  that  includes \nclassroom, on-the-job, and regional and foreign training for senior staff; and (iv) purchase of \ncomputers and other information technology, MIS, communications, and other equipment to \nsupplement existing assets of the LBDC AWB. A financial and asset management strategy will \nbe developed to ensure all levels of the system have adequate operational resources and a \nrationalized sharing plan for abiana.25 The modernization plan will focus on integrating farmer \norganization and IMU responsibilities into overall system operation. \n \n48.  Management  Transformation.  New  procedures  include  improved  monitoring  and \nevaluation,  revised  staff  evaluation  procedures  consistent  with  modern  management,  and \naccountable service contracts between the AWB, farmer organizations, and the Government of \nPunjab.  Once  the  new  operational  procedures,  enhanced  staff  capacity,  and  revised \norganizational structure are in place, the strategic plan will ensure the capacity of AWB senior \nofficers  to  manage  LBDC  operations  without  PIPD  support.  This  final  phase  will  include \ncompetitive recruitment of the AWB director and senior staff who will manage all lower level staff \nand be supported with funds from abiana and any needed subsidy would not be tied to PIPD. \nThe AWB will have transparent accounting with the eventual goal of financial sustainability. \nSenior staff would report to and be supported by a board with mixed representation of PIDA, \nPIPD, other technical experts, and farmers representation.26 The management transfer will have \nclose  monitoring  and  supervision  until  such  time  that  performance  is  judged  to  be  fully \nsatisfactory. \n \n2.  Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Project Preparation Facility \n \n49.  The PIAPPF will ensure that (i) forthcoming projects are expeditiously prepared to fully \nutilize program resources, (ii) future projects are well designed and meet ADB guidelines, and \n(iii) the PIAIP is well managed. The PIAPPF will support capacity development for the investment \nprogram planning and management unit (IPPMU), which will have overall responsibility for the \nPIAIP and PIPD staff within PIPD\u2019s Strategic Planning Cell. The PIAPPF activities will include (i) \n                                                 \n25  Since abiana is the primary source of revenue available for farmer organizations, the organization\u2019s abiana share \nshould be adequate to cover the O&M costs of the minor and distributary canals. While the goal is full cost recovery \nfor the AWB, subsidy may need to be continued for some time as is the case with PIPD\u2019s current operation. This \nshould be phased out as R&U and operating efficiency under the AWB will lead to lower O&M costs. Short-term \nchange in the abiana rate is not supported through the LBDCIP, but a rationalized abiana rate will be needed in the \nlonger term. \n26  A timetable with milestones that defines this transformative process for the LBDC AWB will be a precondition for \napproval of the second tranche of the PIAIP. While the AWB would be responsible for operation of the LBDC, the  \nGovernment of Punjab would still have significant control over operations through the following measures: (i) the \nGovernment of Punjab would own the LBDC assets; (ii) the AWB would be fully accountable to the Government of \nPunjab through the signing of the service agreement; (iii) all decisions will need to be consistent with the service \nagreement; (iv) the Government of Punjab would retain the right to inspect and audit the AWB according to terms \nand conditions specified in the service agreement; and (v) the Government of Punjab would have the right to \nintervene if the AWB does not perform according to the terms of the service agreement. \n ", "15 \nsupport to the IPPMU in reconnaissance analyses and reports on candidate projects to ensure \nconformance with the program selection criteria; (ii) feasibility studies, institutional analyses, \nenvironmental assessments, resettlement plans, and preliminary design to establish economic, \ntechnical, and social viability of subsequent investments; (iii) analyses of design options for R&U \nof barrages, headworks, main canals, distributary and minor canals, and other infrastructure; (iv) \nagreements with concerned farmer organizations over the package of R&U improvements for \ntheir  distributary  and  minor  canals;  (v)  surveys  and  geotechnical,  hydrological,  and  other \ninvestigations necessary for final design; (vi) detailed design, construction drawings, bills of \nquantities, technical specifications, and tender documentation for bid packages for subsequent \nprojects;  and  (iv)  detailed  implementation  arrangements,  service  delivery  mechanisms,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation procedures for subsequent projects under the PIAIP. \n \nC.  Special Features \n50.  As demonstrated through the LBDCIP, the PIAIP takes a holistic and integrated approach \nto improvement of irrigated agriculture and management of water resources through (i) R&U of \nall system infrastructure, from the minor canals to the barrage, and stresses OFWM to ensure \nenhanced  water  supply  is  used  productively;  (ii)  explicit  consideration  of  groundwater  and \nconjunctive use to address productivity and sustainability; (iii) strengthened operational systems \nand  improved  water  management  capacity,  and  (iv)  strengthened  policy  frameworks  for \nimproved water management and decentralized institutions through farmer organizations and \nAWBs mainstreaming reform into irrigated agriculture and water resources. \n \nD.

PMU responsibilities include (i) recruit all \nconsultants; (ii) supervise the work of the design and construction supervision consultants for all \nworks, and process progress and other payments on all contracts upon receiving certification \nfrom the engineer; (iii) coordinate and monitor the civil works on various system components; (iv) \nensure  that  project  works  are  implemented  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  both  the \napproved environmental impact assessment (EIA) and resettlement plans; (v) maintain liaison \nwith PIPD, PIDA, and farmer organizations ensuring that progress related to institutional reform \nkeeps pace with the civil works; (vi) coordinate and supervise the groundwater management \ninitiatives under the Project; and (vii) undertake financial accounting and management ensuring \nthat funds are allocated and made available to all operating units and implementing agencies to \nensure expeditious project implementation.34 \n \n60.  DOFWM will establish a PMO for LBDC OFWM and agriculture support activities, which \nwill be headed by a director who will maintain close regular liaison with the PMU regarding all \nproject-related activities, establish formal project ties with the three relevant district agriculture \noffices, and provide the services of 12 deputy water management officers to the LBDC IMUs. \nEach of these officers will be responsible for the establishment and operation of about six farmer \norganization  field  programs.  PIDA  will  establish  an  LBDC  program  management  office  at \nSahiwal,  headed  by  a  program  director  with  supporting  staff  to  (i)  oversee  initial  farmer \norganization mobilization and establishment activities, (ii) coordinate longer term training and \nsupport activities provided through the IMUs, and (iii) and carry out monitoring and evaluation. \nPIDA will maintain a liaison officer in the program management office to provide coordination and \nsupport for PIDA and PMU activities, particularly farmer organization participation in civil works. \nMobilization and establishment of farmer organizations during the initial 3 years of the Project will \nbe through temporary farmer organization support offices to be established by PIDA in parallel \nwith the three canal division PIUs. \n \n61.  The Project Steering Committee (PSC) established for the implementation of the project \npreparatory technical assistance35 will be retained for both the overview of the PIAIP and the \nLBDCIP implementation. The PSC is chaired by the chairman of the Punjab Planning and \nDevelopment Board. Members include the secretaries of the finance irrigation, agriculture, and \nenvironment departments; member engineering Punjab Planning and Development Board; and \nmanaging director of PIDA. The PMU and IPPMU will serve as the secretariat for the PSC. The \n                                                 \n31  The project director and program director, IPPMU will be grade 20 officers. The directors will be grade 19 officers \nand assistant project director, and deputy program directors will be at least grade 18. The project director, directors, \nand assistant project directors will be supported by the services of PMU consultants. \n32  By the middle of year 3 of LBDCIP implementation and as multiple projects financed under MFF come on line, the \norganization of and terms of reference for the IPPMU and PMU will be reevaluated with a view to centralize \nfunctions common to the multiple PMUs. \n33 Circle is the PIPD management unit responsible for all of LBDC and other large canal systems in Punjab. \n34 As additional projects are added under the PIAIP, additional dedicated PMUs will be established. \n35  ADB.  2005.

Project Implementation Processes by Component \n62.  R&U of Balloki Barrage and the main, branch, distributary, and minor canals including \nappurtenant  works  will  be  the  responsibility  of  the  PMU  and  PMO-barrages  assisted  by \nconsulting services provided under a single contract covering detailed design and construction \nsupervision services for both the Balloki Barrage and its associated works and the LBDC and its \ndistribution system. For both the barrage and the canal civil works contracts, the role of the \nengineer36 will be assigned to the design and supervision consultants who in turn will provide \ndesign services, contract document preparation, and help with prequalification exercises and \nevaluation of bids received from prequalified contractors as well as provide subsequent detailed \nconstruction  supervision.  Payment  to  civil  works  contractors  will  be  made  by  the  PMU  on \ncertification by the engineer, and R&U of the distributary and minor canals will be implemented \nusing similar procedures and approval authorities but providing for full consultation with relevant \nfarmer organizations. \n \n63.  Groundwater database generation, groundwater level and quality monitoring, modeling of \nthe aquifer system, and liaison with province-wide groundwater management organizations will \nbe handled by a groundwater cell within the PMU headed by a deputy director, groundwater \nunder the director, monitoring and evaluation, which will be supported by consultants. OFWM \nand associated agricultural support demonstration activities envisaged under the proposed field \nprograms will be carried out by DOFWM through an LBDC OFWM project office in liaison with \nthe  PMU.  This  office  will  support  the  full-time  services  of  12  deputy  OFWM  officers,  one \nassigned to each IMU. \n \n64.  Social  mobilization  and  capacity  building  for  the  khal  panchayats  and  farmer \norganizations will be managed by the transition wing of PIDA. PIDA staff responsible for these \nactivities  will  be  posted  to  the  three  farmer  organization  support  offices  to  be  temporarily \nestablished (for the initial 3 years of the Project) at Okara, Sihawal, and Khaniwal. The farmer \norganization support offices will maintain full liaison with the relevant PIU to ensure optimal \nmeshing of institutional and system improvement activities. Following initial mobilization and \ntraining, continuing training and support targeted at strengthening farmer organizations will be \nprovided by the 12 IMUs with support of PIDA. PIDA will provide one coordinator and DOFWM \nwill have one officer assigned to each IMU to assist the farmer organizations and manage the \nfield programs. The remaining staff, including the IMU manager, will be hired by the farmer \norganizations with PIDA and PMU support. The Project will support IMU staff for about 4 years \nafter which time declining project funds will be provided for 2 additional years while farmer \norganizations transition to support IMU staff from abiana collections. The IMU will be governed \nby a committee of members from farmer organization management committees from the farmer \norganizations served by the IMU. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n65.  ADB\u2019s financial support for the PIAIP will be extended over 10 years commencing in 2007 \nand ending in 2017. The last date on which disbursement under any loan under the MFF may be \nmade is 30 September 2017. It is expected that the last loan will be executed no later than 31 \nDecember 2015. The LBDCIP will be implemented over 6 years commencing in early 2007. \n                                                 \n36  The engineer has final approval authority for technical matters, development of bidding materials, and sign off on \ncontracting supervision as defined in standard FIDIC general conditions of contract. \n ", "20 \nFormation and training of farmer organizations will start in year 1 and be completed by year 3. \nSurvey and detailed design work necessary prior to award of civil works contracts will commence \nin year 1 with construction commencing in mid-2008 and completed by the end of 2012. The \nproject implementation schedule is presented in Appendix 6. \n \n4.  Procurement \n66.  All  procurement  under  the  PIAIP  and  LBDCIP  will  be  undertaken  following  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (April 2006) as amended from time to time. With respect to the LBDCIP \ncivil works packages for R&U of Balloki Barrage, LBDC main canal, and bulk of the irrigation \ndistribution  system  will  be  awarded  under  international  competitive  bidding  among  suitably \nprequalified contractors.37 Civil works contracts costing less than $5.0 million including those for \nR&U of the Jhandraka and 15-L distributary canals, which will be awarded in two distributary-\ndefined civil works contracts of only medium scale (to facilitate their early construction), will not \nbe suitable for or of interest to international contractors. Moreover, adequate national contracting \ncapacity exists to successfully undertake these works at a reasonable cost; thus they will be \nundertaken under national competitive bidding procedures among suitably prequalified local \ncontractors.38 Before the commencement of any procurement activity under national competitive \nbidding, ADB and the Government will review the Government\u2019s public procurement law to \nensure  consistency  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Any  necessary  modifications  or \nclarifications will be reflected in the procurement plan. Supply contracts estimated to cost the \nequivalent  of  $500,000  equivalent  and  more  will  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international \ncompetitive bidding; those costing $100,000 up to $500,000 equivalent will be awarded on the \nbasis of limited international bidding; and minor items costing $100,000 equivalent or less will be \nprocured under shopping. The procurement plan is in Appendix 7. In addition, procurement plans \nwill be prepared for each project to be financed under the MFF indicating the particular contracts \nfor  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services  required;  proposed  methods  of  procurement; \nthresholds; and related ADB procedures.  \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n67.  Given the increasing demands on PIPD capacity, consulting support for both overseeing \nthe PIAIP and implementing the LBDCIP is required. The IPPMU will be supported by a package \nof consulting services for the PIAPPF to prepare and carry out final design for the ensuing \nprojects to be financed under the MFF. This package will provide for 159 person-months of \ninternational consultants and 1,250 person-months of national specialists to prioritize investment \noptions,  prepare  projects  to  the  feasibility  level,  and  carry  out  detailed  design  and  tender \ndocument preparation.39 For the LBDCIP, contracts for five packages of consultant services will \nbe awarded comprising about 333 person-months of international specialists and 1,423 person-\nmonths of national experts to support all facets of project implementation. Details with regard to \nall packages, staffing, and terms of reference are presented in Supplementary Appendix A. All \nconsultants to be financed under the PIAIP including those for the LBDCIP will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time \nto time). The selection and engagement of required services will be through firms selected under \nquality- and cost-based selection procedures and individuals as required. The PMU will recruit \n                                                 \n37  While the packaging reflected in the procurement plan will be generally adhered to, the PMU and their consultants \nwill design the prequalification exercises and tendering procedures such that qualified bidders can bid on multiple \npackages to ensure an acceptable level of competition while maintaining the interest of the larger international \ncontractors, the result being both quality and cost-effective civil works. \n38  All civil works contracts awarded under international competitive bidding and national competitive bidding will be \nsubject to ADB\u2019s prior approval procedures. \n39  The consultants to support the IPPMU will be recruited by the PMU on behalf of the IPPMU in view of the \nprocurement and contracting expertise available within the PMU. \n ", "21 \nnongovernment organizations for resettlement activities that will be contracted on a competitive \nbasis acceptable to ADB. \n \n68.  The Government of Punjab has asked ADB to provide advance contracting with respect \nto recruitment of all consulting packages for the LBDCIP. ADB has advised the Government of \nPunjab  that  procedures  for  advanced  contracting  are  normally  used  for  recruitment  of \nconsultants without delay, however, the contract is not signed prior to signing of the loan; and \nadvanced contracting does not commit ADB to finance the Project or recruitment costs. The \nGovernment of Punjab has asked ADB to consider approval of retroactive financing for the \naforementioned  activities.  The  Government  of  Punjab  was  informed  that  expenditures  are \neligible for retroactive financing up to 12 months prior to signing of the financing agreement not \nto exceed 20% of the loan amount. Retroactive financing may be used in subsequent tranches \nfrom  the  MFF  for  eligible  expenditures,  except  civil  works,  with  management  approval. \nRetroactive financing in subsequent tranches of the MFF for eligible expenditures, excepting civil \nworks, may be considered and allowed by management if the request is indicated in a PFR. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n69.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  PIPD.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the PIAIP. To support these efforts, \nrelevant provisions of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy are included in the loan regulations and the \nbidding documents for projects under the PIAIP. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the projects under the PIAIP will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of PIPD and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the PIAIP. \n \n70.  A number of implementation arrangements have been formulated specifically to ensure \ngood governance under the Project and will be incorporated in the loan agreements for future \nprojects to be financed under the PIAIP, particularly in the area of financial management. PMU \nstaff at the director level (grade 19) have been provided within the PMU specifically addressing \nfinancial management issues associated with project implementation. Both the project director \nand the director, finance, will be supported by the services of a project/financial management \nspecialist during the initial 5 years of the Project, which will also serve to build up the requisite \ncapacity at all levels of the PMU. A procurement specialist will be placed in the PMU during the \ninitial period of the Project to support procurement activities and develop procurement capacity. \nIn addition, each of the consulting teams providing design and construction supervision services \nfor major project works will include a contracts engineer to ensure that bid evaluation and \ncontract award procedures comply with ADB guidelines and internationally accepted practice. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n71.  To expedite implementation of projects, including the LBDCIP, through the timely release \nof funds, imprest accounts will be established. Under the LBDCIP an imprest account will be \nestablished in Lahore for the use of the PMU. All imprest accounts will be established with the \nNational Bank of Pakistan; and be managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2001)  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  to  by  the \nGovernment of Punjab and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in an imprest account and \nceiling will not exceed 6 months of estimated expenditure or 10% of the total loan amount, \nwhichever is less. The currency will be US dollars. Statement of expenditures procedures will be \nused to reimburse eligible expenditures, or to liquidate and replenish the imprest accounts for \nany individual payment under $100,000. Loan disbursements for goods and services under \n ", "22 \nmajor civil works and consultant\u2019s contracts will be made using direct payment methods as \noutlined in the Loan Disbursement Handbook. Subsequent PFRs will be mutually exclusive, i.e., \neach PFR will be under a separate loan agreement. The loan agreement will describe the \ndetailed disbursement arrangements for a specified PFR, which will be discussed between ADB \nand the Government. Loan disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook, as amended from time to time. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n72.  DOFWM, IPPMU, PIDA, PMO-barrages, and PMU, will prepare and maintain separate \naccounts for project-related expenditures adequate to identify goods and services financed from \nthe loan proceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred for the Project, and use \nof  local  funds.  The  PMU,  through  the  director,  finance,  and  staff  supported  by  the \nproject/financial management consultant, will consolidate and review accounts; and after auditing \nsubmit them to PIPD, Department of Agriculture, Department of Finance, and ADB.40 Project \naccounts will be audited annually by the auditor general of Pakistan and the audited accounts \nand audit report submitted to ADB no later than 6 months following the close of the fiscal year to \nwhich they relate. The audit report will include a statement verifying that funds disbursed by ADB \nagainst statements of expenditure have been used for the purpose for which they were provided. \nThe imprest accounts and statement of expenditures will be audited as a part of the regular audit \nof project accounts and should have separate opinions. \n \n73.  DOFWM, PIDA, PIU, and PIU will be responsible for preparing quarterly financial and \nphysical progress reports on their respective LBDCIP activities and submitting these to the PMU \nfor consolidation. Subsequently, the PMU will provide quarterly progress reports relating to the \nLBDCIP to the IPPMU, PIPD, and ADB. The quarterly reports are to be submitted within 1 month \nfollowing the end of the quarter to which they relate.41 Within 3 months of Project completion, the \nPMU will submit to ADB a project completion report. In addition to quantifying physical progress \nand  monitoring  the  utilization  of  loan  funds,  all  reports  will  include  a  progress  statement \nregarding  the  mobilization  of  farmer  organizations,  their  effectiveness  in  discharging  their \nresponsibilities, and progress in establishing and staffing IMUs to provide necessary technical \nbackstopping to the farmer organizations. Information with respect to compliance with covenants, \nimplementation  progress,  land  acquisition,  resettlement  progress,  and  major  issues  and \nproblems will also be included. \n \n74.  The IPPMU will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly and annual progress reports on \nPIAIP implementation, the form and content of which will be agreed with ADB. The IPPMU will \nactively monitor feasibility preparation and final design activities in accordance with the program \nimplementation schedule, and will keep ADB informed of any significant deviations from the \nschedule. Details regarding specific project activities reported on by the relevant PMUs need not \nbe duplicated but succinctly summarized. At the end of the MFF period, a program completion \nreport will be provided to ADB within 3 months. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n75.  A project performance management system for the LBDCIP will be established in the \nPMU with links to each PIU divisional office, the PIDA management office, and DOFWM within 6 \nmonths of loan effectiveness. The system will be tailored to project-specific requirements and \nprepared in consultation with PIPD, PIDA, and DOFWM as well as concerned (and initially \n                                                 \n40  The findings and recommendations of the financial management assessment during the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance will be incorporated in the project administration memorandum. \n41  In addition, PMU will prepare other such information and reports relating to the Project and its implementation as \nADB may reasonably request. \n ", "23 \nmobilized) khal panchayats and farmer organizations. Participatory monitoring and evaluation \nsystems will be introduced. A database of key benchmark indicators will be established by the \nPMU and become a part of the project monitoring system by 6 months and be routinely updated \nand monitored at least twice a year and in greater detail immediately prior to midterm review and \nproject completion. \n \n10.  Project Review \n76.  During the initial 3 years of LBDCIP implementation, ADB will carry out semiannual \nreviews to (i) ensure that the implementation arrangements are in place and appropriate; (ii) \ngauge  implementation  progress  against  the  agreed  implementation  schedule,  identify \nbottlenecks, and in consultation with the Government of Punjab recommend remedial measures \nfor smoother implementation; (iii) ensure that ADB safeguards and other conditions set out in the \nloan and project agreements are being met; and (iv) assess progress made in mobilizing and \ntraining khal panchayats and farmer organizations and the discharge of their responsibilities. \nTwo years following the effective date, ADB will field a comprehensive midterm review mission \nfor  the  LBDCIP,  which  will  assess  performance,  identify  problems  affecting  project \nimplementation, and reach formal agreement with the Government of Punjab on changes on the \nscope or implementation arrangements of the Project required to address these shortfalls. The \nterms of reference of the midterm review mission will be developed jointly by PIPD and ADB \nduring the second and third year of the Project. Prior to the mission, the Government of Punjab \nwill submit a detailed progress report. Project review arrangements for subsequent projects \nfinanced under the PIAIP will be similar to those detailed for LBDCIP. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits \n77.  Economic and Financial Benefits. The economic and financial benefits for the LBDCIP \nare based on two sources. Nearly all the benefits come from improved agricultural production \nfrom increased yields, greater cropping intensity, and some diversification into high-value crops. \nThis is due to the improved water supply from the system R&U. The majority of benefits under \nthe PIAIP are expected to stem from increased agricultural productivity from improved irrigation \nservice delivery. The R&U will safely increase distribution capacity from a current maximum of \nabout 244 cumecs to 278 cumecs. The economic and financial analyses also reveal that farmers \nat the tail end of canals who have most limited access to canal water and more frequently rely on \nlow-quality groundwater will benefit the most from the Project, which has important productivity \nand equity implications. Crop yields are anticipated to increase from 2% to 7% depending on the \nexisting  deficits  in  crop  water  requirements,  with  cotton,  wheat,  and  sugarcane  seeing  the \nhighest gains. Cropping intensity throughout the LBDCIP area is anticipated to increase by about \n10% to an annual average of 172%, which will be driven by demographic pressures and further \nfarm  fragmentation.  The  Project\u2019s  OFWM  and  agriculture  component  will  help  accelerate \ndiversification to high-value crops within the LBDC command area to supply adjacent markets of \nLahore and Multan. \n \n78.  The LBDCIP will mitigate the risks and damage from floods from the Balloki Barrage and \nits associated infrastructure, and from R&U of the LBDC main canal, which has several sections \nprone to breaching. The infrastructure R&U and development will (i) ensure that the water supply \nto the rehabilitated LBDC and the cropping areas supplied by the Balloki\u2013Sulemanki Link Canal \nare secure, (ii) pass moderate floods through a new spillway reducing the need to breach \nupstream levies and inundate adjacent areas as is the current practice, and (iii) construct two \nbridges to facilitate traffic flow during and following flood events. R&U and development for \nbarrages and other large infrastructure under the PIAIP are expected to provide similar benefits. \n ", "24 \nMore than half the 450,000 farms in the LBDC are less than 2 ha; for farmers with less than 1 ha \nin the tail areas, the Project will yield an 11% rise in income. A total of about 275,000 farm \nfamilies or almost 2 million people will benefit from the LBDCIP. The overall Project provides an \neconomic internal rate of return of 19.2% and a financial internal rate of return of 16.1%. In \naddition, the Project will help stabilize groundwater extraction to a sustainable level, which will \nreduce pumping costs to farmers and ensure that this vital resource continues to be available. \n \nB.  Social and Other Benefits and Impacts \n77.  Institutional Reform and System Sustainability. Although not quantified in the LBDCIP \nbenefits,  formation  of  farmer  organizations  responsible  for  distributary  and  minor  canals \nsupported  by  IMUs  and  reformed  and  strengthened  management  for  LBDC  with  user \nparticipation and better trained staff will lead to the following: (i) greater responsiveness of \nservice to irrigation demands, (ii) more efficient and equitable water distribution, (iii) improved \naccountability and transparency, and (iv) improved collection of abiana with higher expenditures \non system O&M. This will lead to more sustainable systems with better performance. The \nsummary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9. \n \n78.  Environmental Impacts. The LBDCIP is an ADB category B project for the environment. \nAs  a  precautionary  measure,  a  full  EIA  was  conducted  according  to  ADB  guidelines.  The \nGovernment of Punjab regulations required a full EIA due to the presence of two protected areas \nand the size of the LBDC command area. The EIA included extensive stakeholder consultation. \nThe findings of the EIA indicate no significant long-term environmental impacts from the LBDCIP; \nrather  it  will  yield  environmental  benefits  due  to  improved  groundwater  management  and \nassociated  conservation  of  groundwater  and  land  resources  (Appendix  10).  Any  negative \nimpacts  are  expected  to  be  temporary,  mainly  associated  with  the  construction  work,  and \nmitigated through the Project. In addition to the full EIA, a summary EIA, two EIAs and summary \nEIAs for the 15-L and Jhandraka subprojects, an environmental assessment framework, and an \nenvironmental monitoring plan with adequate funding have been prepared for the Project. The \ndesign and supervision contract for civil works has environmental specialists included for long-\nterm inputs to deal with temporary environmental impacts during construction. Environmental \ncapacity development for PIPD will be supported by having a dedicated unit with consultant \nsupport  under  the  director  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  in  the  PMU  for  the  LBDCIP.  All \nsubsequent tranches and their associated projects and subprojects under the PIAIP will be \nassessed independently for environmental categorization and then be prepared in compliance \nwith ADB guidelines (Schedule 5 of the FFA). The PIAIP will provide capacity development \nthrough training, development of procedures, and consultant support as needed for the Strategic \nPlanning Unit that will house the IPPMU. \n \n79.  Resettlement. Land acquisition and resettlement is expected to be minimal, as in many \ncases the land along the canals is already owned by the Government of Punjab and is unused. \nImpacts on buildings and structures will be minimal and most likely will occur only in proximity to \nthe bridges to be rebuilt. The LBDCIP appraisal was based on preparation of a resettlement \nframework for the whole PIAIP and of resettlement plans for the two subprojects under the \nLBDCIP: (i) the 15-L distributary canal subproject, representing the typical distributary canal \nsystem that will be rehabilitated through Project and Program, and (ii) Sahiwal town main canal \nrehabilitation subproject, representing a situation where a relatively densely populated area will \nbe affected. Approval of civil works contract awards for the 15-L distributary and Sahiwal town \nwill require review and updating of the resettlement plans based on detailed design. In addition, \nresettlement plans will be prepared for (i) the main canal based on three contract packages, (ii) \nBalloki Barrage, and (iii) the remaining distribution network based on the award of three large \ncontract packages with each consisting of approximately four plans (12 plans, based on detailed \n ", "25 \ndesign) and two individual packages including one for 15-L and Jandraka canals. Notice to \nproceed for all other subprojects of the LBDCIP and under the PIAIP will be conditional on the \npreparation and approval of resettlement plans. Affected people will be provided with certain \nresettlement entitlements such as land and asset compensation and transfer allowances, prior to \ntheir displacement, dispossession, or restricted access. Appraisal of the successive PFRs will \nrequire a review of the resettlement framework and preparation of resettlement plans for all \nprojects and subprojects with land acquisition and resettlement issues to be presented for ADB \napproval  with  submission  of  the  PFR.  The  resettlement  framework  details  compensation \nprovisions, and land acquisition and resettlement preparation/implementation procedures for the \nwhole MFF. The LBDCIP\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement impacts are detailed in Appendix \n11. The resettlement framework is attached as annexes to the FFA and the resettlement plans \nfor 15-L and Sahiwal town are included in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n80.  Indigenous Peoples. No impacts on indigenous peoples are expected. Punjab has no \npopulation fitting the ADB definition of indigenous peoples. \n \nC.  Risks \n81.  Commitment  to  Reform.  The Government of Punjab has shown its commitment to \nreform through development of the PISRP and active support for the World Bank\u2019s Punjab \nIrrigation Sector Development Policy loan. The Government of Punjab has undertaken action \nthrough the establishment of farmer organizations and AWBs and is committed to continue \ndecentralized  management.  The  MFF  facility  ensures  long-term  engagement  by  ADB  with \nmultiple projects to sustain the reform process. \n \n82.  Robust  Farmer  Organizations.  Development  of  effective  farmer  organizations  to \nsupport sustainable O&M is a key project outcome. A risk exists that farmer organizations may \nnot be developed or sustainable. The experience in LCC East has shown (i) a strong demand of \nfarmer  organization  formation  by  farmers,  (ii)  improved  collection  rates  of  abiana,  and  (iii) \neffective  O&M  being  undertaken  by  farmers\u2019  own  initiatives.  To  ensure  effective  farmer \norganizations,  the  Project  will  support  (i)  intensive  and  ongoing  training,  (ii)  facilities  and \nequipment to establish farmer organization capacity, (iii) IMUs to ensure requisite technical \nguidance  for  O&M,  and  (iv)  adequate  allocation  of  the  abiana  share  to  ensure  financial \nsustainability.  \n \n83.  PIAIP Utilization. A risk exists that program funds will not be fully or effectively utilized. \nThe Program provides for (i) establishment of a dedicated IPPMU within the PIPD Strategic \nPlanning  Cell,  (ii)  $10  million  in  ADF  support  along  with  consultant  terms  of  reference  to \nestablish the PIAPPF to prepare subsequent projects, and (iii) a dedicated PMU for each project; \nin addition the MFF modality allows PIPD staff to gain experience and lessons from past projects \nso  implementation  will  improve.  PIPD  has  substantial  positive  experience  with  aid-funded \nprojects. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n84.  In addition to the standard assurances and to the assurances included in the FFA, the \nGovernment and the Government of Punjab have given the following assurances, which will be \nincorporated, as appropriate in the legal documents for individual projects financed under the \nMFF. \n \n85.  Counterpart  Funding.

Irrigation, Water Resources, and Agriculture in Pakistan \n \n1.  Pakistan is one of the world\u2019s most arid countries with an average annual rainfall of less \nthan 240 millimeters (mm). It is heavily dependent on an average annual inflow to the Indus \nRiver  system  (including  the  mainstream  Indus  and  the  five  Punjab  tributaries:  the  Beas, \nChenab, Jhelum, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers) of about 180 billion cubic meters of water. This runoff, \nfor the most part, originates in neighboring countries and is largely a result of snowmelt in the \nHimalayas coupled with summer monsoon rains. Large-scale irrigation emerged in the 19th \ncentury  and  following  intensive  development  during  the  British  period,  the  Indus  irrigation \nsystem  became  the  largest  contiguous  irrigation  system  in  the  world.  Following  partition, \nPakistan and India negotiated the Indus Waters Treaty (signed in 1960) giving Pakistan rights to \nthe waters of the Chenab, Indus, and Jhelum rivers, which represented about 75% of the flow of \nthe Indus system as a whole.  \n \n2.  A number of challenges, including the critical need for storage, interbasin transfer of \nwater, and water-logging and salinity, have been met with varying degrees of success since \nsigning of the accord, and irrigated agriculture remains a major part of the Pakistan economy. \nThe country has about 17 million hectares (ha) of irrigated cropland; the vast majority is served \nby the Indus basin system. However, agriculture\u2019s role as a major contributor to Pakistan\u2019s \neconomy is declining modestly as other sectors develop. In 1985 agriculture represented 29% \nof Pakistan\u2019s gross domestic product; this declined to 26% in 1985 and was only 21% in 2005. \nSector growth slowed significantly in the late 1990s, registering only 2.7% during 1995\u20132005, \njust over half of the 4.1% growth rate recorded from 1985 to 1995. However, 2005 growth was \n7.5%, indicating that recovery from the growth slump has commenced. \n \n3.  Water is the critical factor both for the economy and agriculture. About 80% of the arable \nland and 90% of the agricultural output are entirely dependent on irrigation; irrigation uses about \n95% of the country\u2019s water resources. Accordingly, irrigated agriculture is a vital sector and \neffective management of irrigation represents the most important critical challenge of integrated \nwater resource management. Pakistan faces a number of serious water resource issues that \nhave serious economic and environmental implications, including (i) rapidly declining water \navailability per capita as a result of increasing population and declining storage capacity as a \nresult of reservoir sedimentation; (ii) mistrust and lack of consensus among the provinces on the \nprovision of additional storage on the Indus to both replace storage lost and add additional \nstorage  to  meet  increasing  demands; 1  (iii)  overexploitation  and  deteriorating  quality  of \ngroundwater caused by the recent drought (2000\u20132005), undependable and inequitable canal \nwater delivery, and increasing pollution; (iv) deteriorating, unreliable, and inefficient irrigation \ninfrastructure resulting from aging improper asset management, and inadequate operation and \nmaintenance; (v) poor governance, transparency, and accountability of irrigation service delivery \nlargely due to the absence of user participation in system management; (vi) low water-use \nefficiency and agricultural production; and (vii) seawater intrusion and serious environmental \ndegradation of the Indus delta and adjoining coastal areas from inadequate water releases from \nenvironmental flows. \n \n                                                 \n1  Pakistan has a long tradition of water entitlements, and the 1991 Inter-provincial Water Accord establishes clear \nentitlements for each province. Implicit in the accord, is a set of water entitlements at the canal command level. \nRules are also well-established for distributing water to distributary canals although implementation by system \nmanagers of these provisions is weak. At the outlets, farmers practice well-established rotational schedules. \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \nB.  Agriculture in Punjab \n \n4.  Agriculture  is  the  mainstay  of  Punjab\u2019s  economy.  Given  Punjab\u2019s  size,  Punjab\u2019s \neconomic  indicators  to  a  large  degree  drive  the  same  indicators  for  Pakistan.  However, \ncomposition of the indicators differs. Agriculture\u2019s role in the overall economy is marginally \nhigher in Punjab than in the country as a whole, accounting for about 26% of the provincial \ngross domestic product (GDP) and providing direct employment to more than 50% of the labor \nforce. \n \n5.  Performance of agriculture in Punjab has been strong over the past 20 years, growing at \naround 4%\u20135% per annum. Since the 1960s, agricultural growth in Punjab has resulted largely \nfrom the adoption of improved inputs including high-yielding varieties, fertilizer, and pesticides, \ncoupled with an increased supply of irrigation water.2 Recently, however, agricultural appears to \nbe decelerating. For the past 30 years the productivity of the water used in agriculture (i.e., \nproduction per unit volume of water used) has been slowly declining as a result of water-logging \nand salinity, as well as the deteriorating quality of groundwater sources. The recently noted \ndecline in agricultural growth may well be attributable to the fact that water availability, both \nsurface and groundwater, is increasingly becoming a limiting factor.3 Given the position of \nirrigated agriculture as the driving force in the provincial economy, a reasonable growth in the \nsector is essential to sustain overall economic growth and performance. This will require (i) \ninvestment  targeted  at  rehabilitating  and  upgrading  irrigation  infrastructure;  (ii)  systematic \nregulation and management of groundwater resources; and (iii) establishment and development \nof institutions responsible for improving the efficiency and reliability of irrigation service delivery, \nand ensuring equitable sharing of irrigation supplies. \n \nC.  Irrigated Agriculture in Punjab \n \n6.  Irrigated agriculture is crucial for Punjab. The province accounts for 80% of Pakistan\u2019s \nagricultural production, and over 90% of Punjab\u2019s agricultural production is derived from the 8.4 \nmillion  ha  of  irrigated  land  served  by  Punjab\u2019s  irrigation  and  drainage  system.  Irrigated \nagriculture uses over 95% of the water resources. Punjab provides about 58% of the country\u2019s \nGDP and Punjab\u2019s agricultural GDP represents 66% of the national agricultural GDP. The \nirrigated  agriculture  sector  is  crucial  to  any strategy  for  generating  additional employment, \nincreasing incomes, and attaining the targeted 6%\u20137% annual growth rate for Punjab.4 \n \n7.  More than half of Pakistan\u2019s irrigated land lies in Punjab and the associated irrigation \ninfrastructure is managed and operated by the province.5 Irrigated agriculture in Punjab covers a \ncultivable command area of 8.41 million ha with a provincial irrigated cropping intensity of about \n122%. Much of the extensive irrigation infrastructure was initially developed under the British; a \nlater period of significant development occurred under the Indus Basin Project during the 1960s. \nThis infrastructure base provides the foundation for irrigated agriculture in Punjab (Table A2). \nThe total estimated value of the irrigation and water resource management infrastructure in \n                                                 \n2  The increased irrigation supplies have resulted from the exponential growth of tubewells throughout Punjab within \nthe past decade. Exemplifying this growth is the Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) command where the number of \nirrigation tubewells increased from 19,960 in 1994 to more than 48,000 in 2005. This relates to an increase in the \nabstraction of groundwater of 1,964 million cubic meters over 10 years suggesting an annual increase of about 200 \nmillion cubic meters. \n3  The decline in agricultural growth over the past 4 years corresponds with a period of extreme drought.  \n4  ADB, Department for International Development, Government of the Punjab, and World Bank. 2005.

The  Punjab  Irrigation  and  Power  Department  (PIPD)  is  responsible  for \ndevelopment,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  management  of  surface  irrigation \nfacilities in Punjab. \n \nTable A2: Key Infrastructure of the Punjab Irrigation System \n \nItem  Quantity \nHeadworks/Barrages  13  \nMain Canal Systems.  24\u20136,429 km \nDistributary and Minor Canals  2,794\u201331,214 km \nTotal Off-Take Capacity and Field Outlets  3,399 cumec; 58,000 units \nGross Command Area  9.45 million ha \nCultivable Command Area  8.41 million ha \nOff-Take Capacity and Length of Link Canals  3,115 cumec; 850 km \nTubewells  3,544 \nLength of Surface Drains  9,856 km \nLength of Flood Embankments  3,228 km \nSmall Dams  33 \ncumec = cubic meter per second, ha = hectare, km = kilometers. \nSource: Punjab Irrigation Sector Reform Program (PIPD), March 2006. \n \nD.  Irrigation Sector Performance In Punjab \n \n8.  Like the rest of Pakistan, Punjab faces major challenges with respect to water resources \nand irrigated agriculture, which have serious economic and environmental implications. As a \nresult, the full potential of irrigated agriculture contribution to economic growth and employment \nis not being achieved.  \n \n9.  Population  growth  and  farm  fragmentation  have  resulted  in  significantly  increased \ncropping intensities driving irrigation water demand far beyond the original design capacity. The \nsystems were designed for low cropping intensities of 60%\u201380% with assumed fallow land. \nAnnual cropping intensity in Punjab is 122%, and in more productive systems such as the LBDC \nit averages about 160%, reaching 200% in some areas. This has led to increasing water supply \nshortfalls that are exacerbated during drought and because Pakistan has lost nearly 30% in its \neffective Indus Basin water storage due to reservoir sedimentation. \n \n10.  All irrigation and water resource management infrastructure has deteriorated over time \ndue  to  a  combination  of  age  and  lack  of  adequate  maintenance.7 In  certain  cases,  the \ndilapidated state of a few major structures is dangerous in view of the physical risk to the well-\nbeing of downstream residents. For the most part, the poor condition of the canals simply \nmeans that the infrastructure does not provide reliable service delivery, and farmers have to \nadapt to unreliable, substandard delivery of irrigation water. \n \n11.  Poor irrigation service delivery by the public sector, which is characterized by unreliable \nand inequitable irrigation deliveries, low accountability, absence of water-user participation in \n                                                 \n6  This does not include the storage facilities of Chasma, Mangla, and Tarbela dams, watercourses, or private \ninvestment in tubewells. \n7  The accumulated deferred maintenance is estimated to be about $2.0 billion, the requirement for deferred \nmaintenance plus justifiable upgrading about $3.5 billion. \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \nsystem  management,  and  lack  of  communication  with  farmers  contributes  significantly  to \nsuboptimal  utilization  of  water  resources.8 Low  O&M  cost  recovery  is  a  reflection  of  user \ndissatisfaction  with  irrigation  service  delivery.  Abiana  (irrigation  service  fee)  proceeds  are \ncollected by the district revenue department and subsequently become a part of provincial \nrevenues and resources, rather than being retained and used for O&M in the command areas \nwhere they are collected. Consequently, farmers correctly conclude that there is no relationship \nbetween the revenue generated and allocation of funds for O&M on a given canal. \n \n12.  PIPD  has  grown  over  time  and  failed  to  put  into  place  the  required  conditions  of \naccountability and transparency that guarantee efficiency. PIPD has about 50,000 employees, \ncosting 65% of the annual O&M budget, leaving only 35% for maintenance. The organizational \nstructure, skill mix, assignment of responsibility, and institutional culture remain unchanged from \nthe British period, and the once good institutional discipline has largely broken down. Staff \nsalaries are well below those in the private sector. Lack of transparency in water allocation,9 \nmeasurement,10 and delivery result in uncertainties and inequities in water distribution and \nopportunities for rent seeking. Farmers comprehend the natural variability of their water supply, \nbut want to know what their share is and when it will be delivered. Having this information, they \nare better equipped to make informed and lower risk decisions on how best to use both the \nwater and their land.  \n \n13.  As a result of unreliable surface water supply, the explosive growth in the number of \ntubewells in Punjab has led to overexploitation of groundwater resources with resulting drops in \nwater tables signifying mining of groundwater.11 The rapid increase in volume of groundwater \npumped  partly  reflects  the  unreliability  of  canal  water  deliveries,  which  forces  farmers  to \nincreasingly rely on groundwater, particularly in the tail reaches of the canal system. As water \ntables decline increasing regional groundwater inflows, a rapid deterioration in groundwater \nquality often accompanies the declining aquifers.12 In many cases, the indiscriminate use of low-\nquality groundwater is leading to an increasing expanse of cultivable command within Punjab \nthat suffers from secondary soil salinity or is becoming sodium affected. Consequently crop \nyields in the affected areas are quite low. \n \nE.  Government of Punjab Actions to Address Sector Problems \n \n14.  Institutional reforms in the water sector in Punjab were initiated under the National \nDrainage  Program  (NDP),  which  was  supported  by  ADB,  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation, and World Bank.13 The initial results were modest with respect to Punjab; little \n                                                 \n8  Rent seeking by public sector operating entities, water theft by upstream farmers, and the poor condition of the \ncanal system all contribute to tail-end farmers rarely receiving irrigation deliveries from the system and invariably \nnot receiving their fair share of water. \n9  Pakistan\u2019s 1991 interprovincial Water Apportion Accord lays out provincial entitlements. However, administration of \nintraprovincial water entitlement needs to be much more transparent. Farmers get little information on water \navailability in the system, amounts supplied, and/or the reliability of future delivery. \n10  Most canal systems are not equipped with calibrated water measuring devices. \n11  Mining occurs when pumping exceeds recharge and regional inflow (sustainable yield) and groundwater is \npermanently removed from storage within the aquifer. Water balance studies conducted on the LBDC command \nindicate that 411 million cubic meters are being mined annually resulting in a water table decline of 0.37 meters per \nyear. \n12  The origins of the aquifer system largely dictate the distribution of groundwater quality. Geologically, the subsiding \ndepositional basin retained brackish water at depth. Adjacent to rivers, which constantly adjusted their courses, the \ndeposits were continually flushed by fresh water, displacing the original more brackish depositional waters. As a \nresult, groundwater near the rivers is generally less saline than that in adjacent areas. \n13  To support the reforms in the NDP, the Punjab Irrigation and Drainage Authority (PIDA) Bill was passed on 27 June \n1997 that (i) established PIDA as separate entity from PIPD for decentralized irrigation management and gave all \n ", "    Appendix 2       37     \nprogress was made with the reform agenda. This situation has changed dramatically as a \nreform-minded leadership has emerged that targeted water sector issues among Punjab\u2019s top \ndevelopment priorities. In 2005, the chief minister appointed a senior committee headed by the \nchairman  of  the  Planning  and  Development  Board  with  members  from  key  provincial \ndepartments including finance, agriculture, environment, and PIPD, to oversee the development \nof the Irrigation Sector Reform Program and an action plan. \n \n15.  The  Irrigation  Sector  Reform  Program  supports  the  broader  multisector  provincial \nstrategy that emphasizes (i) improving governance by enhancing the accountability of state \ninstitutions,  (ii)  improving  social  service  delivery  systems,  (iii)  accelerating  growth  and \ngenerating  employment  through  focus  on  productive  sectors,  and  (iv)  enhancing  the \neffectiveness of public sector expenditures through budgetary and institutional reforms. The \nprogram is being implemented in conjunction with the recently approved Punjab Irrigation Sector \nDevelopment Policy loan,14 a program-type loan with an associated policy matrix for sector \nreform that corresponds to the Irrigation Sector Reform Program and its four interrelated pillars. \n \n16.  Pillar I: Institutional and Policy Reforms to Improve Management and Maintenance \nof  the  Irrigation  System.  The  objective  is  to  ensure  long-term  physical  and  financial \nsustainability of Punjab\u2019s irrigation system. A multipronged strategy is provided with short- and \nmedium-term measures for (i) improving asset management, progressively reducing the backlog \nof deferred maintenance; (ii) reducing operating and administrative costs; (iii) rationalizing and \nimproving  recovery  of  abiana  through  a  new  system  of  inflation  adjustments  and  user \nparticipation in assessment and collection; (iv) introducing a transparent policy for maintenance \nand repair cost sharing (i.e., government plus user charges); and (v) developing institutional \ncapacity for efficient O&M with improved attention to social and environmental considerations. \n \n17.  Pillar II: Water Resource Management Reforms. The objective is to emphasize the \nimportance of water entitlements, measurements, and transparency; and build on Punjab\u2019s \nexisting  platform  of  water  entitlements, 15  to  make  intraprovincial  water  allocations  and \ndistribution more transparent, and to extend the system of entitlements to groundwater. These \nreforms  would  serve  to  enhance  farmer  confidence,  reduce  uncertainties  associated  with \nirrigation  deliveries,  and  help  increase  agricultural  productivity.  Over  the  longer  term,  the \nopportunity cost for water would become more transparent and provide incentives for allocation \nof water to uses resulting in higher return, through a market mechanism. As a first step in this \ndirection, PIPD is taking actions to ensure reliable water measurement, and is publicizing water \nentitlements  and  actual  diversions  at  the  main  canal  level. 16  PIPD  has  also  initiated \ndevelopment of a strategy to help ensure the sustainable use of groundwater, among others, \nthrough improved monitoring, information dissemination, and farmer participation; the drafting of \nthe strategy or its implementation has not yet commenced. \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \nresponsibility and assets to PIDA for irrigation service delivery, and (ii) provided a legal framework to establish (a) \nfarmers organizations to manage the distributary and minor canals, and collect and retain a share of abiana for \nO&M, and (b) area water boards to direct management of irrigation systems at the main canal level and that would \nbe governed by a board of directors with a majority of farmer members. \n14  The loan was approved 1 June 2006 for $100 million. It is the first of three tranches that will be processed as \nindividual loans with the next loan anticipated for approval in 2007. The loan provides budget support.  \n15  Implicit in the 1991 Inter-provincial Water Accord is a set of water entitlements at the canal command level beyond \nprovincial allocations. It provides well-established rules for distributing water to the distributaries and outlets. Below \nthe outlets, the warabandi (farmer rotation) is a proxy to a water right, through which a farmer has a right to time of \ndelivery.  The  administration  of  intraprovincial  water  entitlements  needs  to  be  made  more  transparent  and \nimplemented in a participatory manner. \n16  Gradually these arrangements will be instituted for distributary canals and ultimately for individual users. \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \n18.  Pillar III: Irrigation Service Delivery Reforms. The objective is to improve the quality, \nefficiency, and accountability with which irrigation services are delivered. Irrigation institutions in \nPakistan have not yet made the transition from the era of development and construction to \nmanagement of assets; service delivery is the primary objective.17 This challenge will be met \nthrough a combination of organizational changes and introduction of incentives. Essentially, this \nwould involve (i) decentralization of management and O&M of the system; (ii) entry of new \nparticipants, including farmer organizations, in the management and distribution of water; and \n(iii) the use of contracts that specify the rights and obligations of water providers and users.  \n \n19.  Pillar IV: On-Farm Agricultural Water Management Reforms. Full benefits of the \ninitial three sets of sector reform can only be realized if irrigation application efficiency at farms \nis improved and productivity increases. The objective of these reforms is to improve water use \nefficiency  and  on-farm  productivity  through  the  introduction  of  changes  in  field  irrigation \ninfrastructure, agronomic practices, irrigation technology, and institutional structure conducive to \na  sustainable,  efficient,  and  more  demand-responsive  irrigation.  The  Punjab  provincial \ngovernment is simultaneously addressing these through (i) clearly defined agricultural policies, \nand (ii) an effective applied agricultural research program that will generate appropriate water \nmanagement technology and improved agronomic practice. \n \n20.  Progress  in  the  Field.  The  Punjab  provincial  government  is  moving  forward \naggressively with on-the-ground action in relation to Pillar III and establishment of decentralized \nmanagement through implementation of the reforms related to the NDP. Since 2003, in the \nLower Chenab Canal East, 83 farmer organizations have been formed and an area water board \n(AWB) established as part of an irrigation rehabilitation project financed under the NDP by \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation.18 PIPD has also committed to establishing 100 more \nfarmer organizations and two additional AWBs under the Punjab Irrigation Sector Development \nPolicy loan. Notification to form farmer organizations and establish an AWB in the LBDC was \ngiven on 11 July 2006, specifying the PIPD superintending engineer for the LBDC Circle as its \nchief  executive  officer.  Initially,  the  AWB  will  serve  an  advisory  function.  As  of  2006,  the \nexperience of the farmer organizations in LCC has been positive with financial sustainability and \nmuch improved O&M. All these elements support a substantial, sustained long-term investment \nprogram with linked reforms in irrigated agriculture to support continued economic growth. \n \n                                                 \n17  Initiating the transition to a modern irrigation service delivery structure was one of the major objectives of the NDP. \nWhile achievements under the NDP were modest, a number of lessons were learned such as focusing on a \nmanageable number of key objectives and encouraging experimentation with different models for institutional \nreform. The institutional reform objectives of the NDP remain valid. \n18  The LCC East project is financed by JBIC and the project was initiated using NDP funds during the latter stages of \nthe NDP in 2002 with the condition of farmer organizations being formed as a requirement for civil works. Since this \ntime, JBIC has started the LCC West project under separate funding; work started in 2006. \n ", "Appendix 3      39 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR \n \nTable A3.1: Asian Development Bank Lending to the Water Sector \n \nAmount  \nLoan  Project  Date Approved \n($ million) \n800-PAK  Punjab Community Water Supply and Sanitation Sector  50.0   28 Nov 2002 \n1679-PAK  Punjab Farmer-Managed Irrigation  7.8  25 Mar 1999 \n1578-PAK  Second Flood Protection (Sector)  100.0  13 Nov 1997 \n874-PAK  Korangi Wastewater Management  70.0   18 Sep 1997 \n1413-PAK  National Drainage (Sector)  140.0  12 Dec 1995 \n837-PAK  Punjab Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (Sector)  46.0   31 Jan 1995 \n1297-PAK  Third Punjab On-Farm Water Management  62.1  08 Mar 1994 \n1294-PAK  Pehur High-Level Canal  127.6  22 Dec 1993 \n901-PAK  Urban Water Supply and Sanitation  72.0   04 Nov 1993 \n1209-PAK  Flood Damage Restoration (Sector)  100.0  15 Dec 1992 \n976-PAK  Karachi Sewerage  51.0   14 Dec 1989 \n957-PAK  Karachi Sewerage  34.0   14 Dec 1989 \n1101-PAK  Faisalabad Water Supply, Sewerage, and Drainage  39.5   15 Dec 1977 \n1146-PAK  Hyderabad Water Supply and Sewerage  22.0   13 Apr 1976 \n  Total  922.0    \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable A3.2: World Bank Lending to the Water Sector \n \nAmount \nProject  Date Approved \n($ million) \nPunjab Irrigation Sector Development Policy Loan  100.0  01 June 2006 \nSindh On-Farm Water Management Project  61.1  20 May 2004 \nAJK Community Infrastructure  20.0  09 July 2002 \nNWFP On-Farm Water Management Project  21.4  12 Jun 2001 \nBiodiversity Conservation Project  10.1  24 Apr 2001 \nNational Drainage Program Project  285.0  04 Nov 1997 \nPunjab Private Sector Groundwater Development Project  56.0  11 Jul 1996 \n2nd Karachi Water Supply  91.9  09 Feb 1993 \nFordwah Eastern Sadiqia (South) Irrigation and Drainage Project  54.2  02 Jul 1992 \nScarp Transition Project (02)  20.0  04 Jun 1991 \nKarachi Port Modernization Project  91.4  30 May 1991 \nOn-Farm Water Management Project (03)  83.6  21 May 1991 \nRural Water Supply and Sanitation Project  136.7  23 Apr 1991 \nPrivate Tubewell Development  34.4  11 Apr 1989 \nKarachi Water Supply and Sanitation Project (02)  125.0  28 Feb 1989 \nPunjab Urban Development Project  90.0  12 Apr 1988 \nIrrigation Systems Rehabilitation Project (02)  79.5  29 Mar 1988 \nSubtotal  1,360.3   \nTotal  2,282.8 \nAJK = Azad Jammu Kashmir, NWFP = North-West Frontier Province \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable A3.3: Asian Development Bank Nonlending to Water Supply, Sanitation and Waste \nManagement \n \nLoan   Project  Amount ($)  Date Approved \n4534-PAK  Sindh Basic Urban Services  0   23 Dec 2004 \n4432-PAK  Capacity Building for Environmental Management in Sindh  400,000   12 Nov 2004 \n4098-PAK  Rawalpindi Environmental Improvement  350,000   21 Apr 2003 \n3862-PAK  Punjab Community Water Supply and Sanitation  125,000   04 May 2002 \n2928-PAK  Quetta Water Supply and Environmental Improvement  0   05 Dec 1997 \n2006-PAK  Second Urban Water Supply and Sanitation  0   03 Dec 1993 \n ", "40         Appendix 3 \nLoan   Project  Amount ($)  Date Approved \n1744-PAK  Water Supply and Sanitation Authority for Rawalpindi  100,000   18 Aug 1992 \n1736-PAK  Punjab Rural Water Supply Sector  0   23 Jul 1992 \n1349-PAK  Urban Water Supply and Sanitation  0   08 Aug 1990 \n1246-PAK  Strengthening of Billing and Collection Operations of the KWSB  183,700   14 Dec 1989 \n1245-PAK  Marine Outfall Study  281,700   14 Dec 1989 \n0963-PAK  Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Study  350,000   11 Mar 1988 \n0297-PAK  Rawalpindi Water Supply and Sewerage  200,000   28 Jun 1979 \n0120-PAK  Hyderabad Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Development  150,000   02 Jul 1974 \n0119-PAK  Lyalipur Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Development  150,000   02 Jul 1974 \n  Subtotal  2,290,400   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n ", " \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n($ \u2018000) \n    ADB Loan  Foreign  Local  Duties & \nGov\u2019t. of \n  Item  OCR  ADF  Total   Exchange  (Excluding  Taxes \nPunjab \nTaxes) \nI.

Background \n \n105.  Sector Overview. Improved productivity of irrigated agriculture and water resources is \nvital to Punjab\u2019s economic development. Irrigated agriculture (i) accounts for 28% of Punjab\u2019s \ngross domestic product (GDP), (ii) employs more than 50% of the labor force, (iii) produces 90% \nof Punjab\u2019s agricultural output, and (iv) uses more than 95% of the water resources. Punjab \nprovides about 58% of the Pakistan\u2019s GDP, and Punjab agricultural GDP is 66% of the national \nagricultural GDP. The irrigated agriculture sector is crucial to attaining the 6%\u20137% growth \ntargeted by the Government of Punjab. The Government of Punjab\u2019s total outlay for irrigation in \n2006/07 is $142 million; a 21% increase over the allocation for 2005/06, and accounts for 13% \nof the core Annual Development Program (2006/07). The projected outlays are $200 million in \n2007/08 (41% increase) and $267 million in 2008/09 (33% increase). \n \n106.  The Punjab Irrigation and Power Department (PIPD) is responsible for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) and management of surface irrigation systems in Punjab that cover a gross \ncommand area of 9.5 million hectares (ha) and have a cultivable command area (CCA) of 8.4 \nmillion  ha.  The  replacement  value  of  government-owned  irrigation  and  water  resources \nmanagement infrastructure in Punjab is about $20 billion. The condition of infrastructure has \nseriously  deteriorated  due  to  (i)  age  (much  is  nearly  100  years  old),  (ii)  lack  of  asset \nmanagement  planning,  and  (iii)  underfunding  and  ineffective  O&M.  The  estimated  cost  of \ndeferred maintenance is about $2 billion; the cost to modernize the systems for enhanced \nmanagement capacity is about $3.5 billion. The poor condition of some large infrastructure \nposes failure risks, and overall irrigation service delivery is unreliable, particularly at tail ends of \ncanals.  Population  growth  and  farm  fragmentation  has  resulted  in  significantly  increased \ncropping intensities, driving demand for irrigation water far beyond the original design capacity \nfor  cropping  intensity.  To  meet  their  needs,  farmers  have  installed  private  tubewells  for \nincreased reliability and water supply; no effective groundwater management is in place, and \nmuch of Punjab has rapidly declining water tables.  \n \nB.  The Program and Project \n \n107.  The Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program (PIAIP). The PIAIP and its first \nproject, the Lower Bari Doab Canal Improvement Project (LBDCIP), will result in economic \ngrowth and improved sustainability of water and land resources. The PIAIP is a $900 million \ninvestment program proposed for financing through the multitranche financing facility of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  It  will  provide  (i)  rehabilitation  and  upgrading  (R&U)  of \nirrigation  infrastructure,  (ii)  institutional  reform  for  water  management,  (iii)  reformed  and \nrestructured  institutions  for  improved  and  sustainable  irrigation  service  delivery,  and  (iv) \ncapacity development. Investments subsequent to the LBDCIP include the: (i) Pakpattan Canal \nand Sulemanki Barrage, (ii) Thal Canal, (iii) Sidhnai Canal, and (iv) Trimmu and Punjnad \nbarrages. The investment amount for the PIAIP is based on sector needs, funds devoted to the \nsector, identified projects, the absorptive capacity of PIPD and Government of Punjab, and \nanticipated inflation during the program period. \n \n108.  The LBDCIP. The Balloki Barrage diverts water to the Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) \nirrigation system and the Balloki\u2013Sulemanki Link Canal to supply irrigation to more than 1.82 \nmillion ha. The barrage and LBDC irrigation system needs substantial R&U due to deterioration \nand to enhance management capacity for water distribution. The present CCA area of the LBDC \nis about 703,500 ha; originally designed to meet a cropping intensity of about 70%, which has \nincreased to 160%. Farmers have installed private tubewells to supplement canal water, and the \n ", "48        Appendix 8           \nconjunctive  use  of  surface  and  groundwater  makes  meeting  increasing  irrigation  demands \npossible.  The  groundwater  table  has  been  declining;  salinity  of  groundwater  has  been \nincreasing,  and  mixing  of  surface  and  groundwater  is  required  in  some  areas  to  ensure \nacceptable salinity levels. \n \n109.  The LBDCIP has five components related to the LBDC: (i) R&U of the Balloki Barrage; \n(ii) R&U of the LBDC distribution network, (iii) groundwater management, (iv) on-farm water \nmanagement and agriculture, and (v) institutional strengthening and operation modernization. \nThe LBDCIP includes development of the Punjab irrigated agriculture project preparation facility, \nwhich  will  prepare  subsequent  projects  under  the  PIAIP.  The  LBDCIP  base  costs  are \napproximately $198.3 million for the five components directly related to the LBDC and will be \nfinanced  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources.  The  Punjab  irrigated  agriculture  project \npreparation facility will be financed from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development \nFund) with a base cost of $9.4 million.1 Together with contingencies, finances charges, and \ntaxes, the total cost of the LBDCIP is $281.4 million of which $217.8 million will be a loan from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources;  $10  million  will  be  a  loan  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, and $53.6 million will be financed by the Government of Punjab. \n \nC.  Overview of the Economic and Financial Analyses \n \n110.  Demand Analysis. PIPD, a public agency, supplies canal water to the LBDC system at \na fixed-rate based on a per acre rate of PRs80 for the kharif season and PRs55 for the rabi \nseason (total of PRs135 per year per acre or about PRs337 per ha), providing no direct \nconnection between the volume of water consumed and the prices paid. Similarly, the cost for \ncanal  water  is  not  based  on  the  full  cost  of  service  provision;  a  subsidy  supports  PIPD \noperations. PIPD is a monopoly supplier so that the farmer has no choice with regard to the \nmarket for surface irrigation. Pricing and consumption is therefore distorted for many reasons \nincluding political pressure to keep fees low. Irrespective of the pricing, in terms of demand, all \nof the irrigation water supplied by the canal is consumed, and the substantial development of \ngroundwater reflects that demand for irrigation water is significantly greater than what can be \nsupplied through the canal system.2 This is underscored by the fact that groundwater may cost \n10 times as much as surface water, and is used by nearly 100% of the farmers in the LBDC \narea.3 The additional canal provided by the LBDCIP is not expected to affect demand or the \nprice for canal water within a market framework. However, the improved service delivery and \ninstitutional changes with management oversight by water users makes the increase of fees \npossible to improve cost recovery and O&M. Improved canal water delivery will provide a \nsubstitute for more expensive and poorer quality groundwater, stabilize the water table, and \nlead to a more sustainable agricultural production system. \n \n111.  With-  and  Without-Project  Scenario. The approach to the economic and financial \nanalyses is based on projected outcomes with and without the Project. The without-project \nscenario is characterized by continued degradation of the entire LBDC irrigation system. This \nwill reduce canal water distribution, especially at the tails, and limit groundwater recharge, while \npumping of groundwater increases to make up for the lack of canal water. This will result in \nfurther  decline  of  the  water  table  with  subsequent  higher  pumping  costs,  replacement  of \ncentrifugal tubewell pumps with more powerful turbine pumps, and possible loss of access to \ngroundwater by poorer farmers and those in saline-affected areas. Mixing of canal water with \nsaline groundwater is critical to sustain the current cropping intensity at the tail end. While \n                                                 \n1  The PIAPPF is excluded from the economic and financial analysis of the LBDCIP. \n2  The number of tubewells in the LBDCIP area has increased from about 10,000 to 48,000 during the last 15 years. \n3  Groundwater may cost from PRs150 to PRs300 per hour, which is generally the amount needed for an average \nsize field. Anywhere from 4 to 8 waterings may be required depending on the crop and soil conditions. \n ", "Appendix 8        49 \noverall  productivity  will  decline  and  all  farmers  will  suffer  in  the  without-project  scenario, \ntailenders, who are already the worst off, will suffer the most. In the with-project scenario, these \nnegative outcomes will be avoided. Not only will important productivity gains for the entire LBDC \noccur, but also significant positive equity implications for the tail ends will result. \n \n112.  Under the without-project scenario, the Balloki Barrage and its associated works will \ncontinue to deteriorate, and continued use without R&U will increase the probability of damage \nor failure during a severe flood. This will cause a dire water shortage for the LBDC and Balloki\u2013\nSulemanki Link command  areas and  result  in  excessive  pumping  and  further depletion  of \ngroundwater  to  try  and  meet  irrigation  needs.  In  addition,  moderate  to  severe  floods  are \ncurrently accommodated by breaching of the right bank levy above the barrage in order to \nprotect it. This causes flood damage to crops and other assets in adjacent areas and inundates \nan important roadway to Faisalabad. \n \n113.  CCA Assumptions. The economic and financial analyses of the LBDCIP were carried \nout  based  on  changes  in  gross  margins  from  the  incremental  agriculture  productivity.  To \naccount for the heterogeneity of LBDC\u2019s large 703,500 ha CCA, it was divided into three broad \ncategories  based  on  water  availability:  (i)  head  reaches  where  canal  water  supplies  are \nadequate and shortages are easily met from high-quality groundwater recharged from the canal \nwater; about 40% of the CCA (281,500 ha); (ii) middle-tail reaches with similar water availability \nto  head  reaches,  but  more  shortage  and  less  groundwater  recharge;  about  40%  of  the \ncommand (281,500 ha); and (iii) tail-saline where surface water supplies are usually inadequate \nand shortages not easily met from groundwater that is of poor quality, about 20% of the CCA or \n(140,500 ha). The density of tubewells is less in the head reach due to sufficient surface \nsupplies, and higher in middle and tail reaches. However, the marginal or brackish groundwater \ncauses less tubewell utilization in tail-saline areas because it diminishes crop productivity. \n \n114.  Prices. The LBDC has intensive and progressive farming compared to other parts of \nPunjab  with  crops sold  in  numerous  markets  throughout  the  area. Most  inputs  like  seed, \nfertilizers, and pesticides are provided through a well-developed network of private dealers \nlocated  in  local  markets.  Farmgate  prices  in  the  analysis  were  established  after  market \nassessments and discussions with farmers. Financial prices were converted to economic prices \nthrough  standard  methods.  The  shadow  exchange  rate  was  estimated  by  weighting  the \neffective export and import exchange rates by the proportion of total trade. The standard \nconversion factor for traded goods, the reciprocal of the shadow exchange rate, is estimated at \n90%. Import and export border parity prices for the main agricultural commodities and factors of \nproduction were calculated to establish the price relationship between the local market value of \ntraded commodities produced on the farm and their internationally traded values. Financial \nprices were adjusted to economic values by eliminating transfer payments (subsidies and \ntaxes) and adjusting the costs of traded inputs involved in the production chain (e.g., storage, \nhaulage,  and  processing).  Specific  economic  conversion  factors  were  calculated  for \ninternationally traded agricultural commodities including both farm produce and inputs used \n(e.g., chemical fertilizers). \n \nD.  Project Benefits and Assumptions  \n \n115.  Nearly  all  the  project  benefits  (93%)  accrue  from  increased  agricultural  productivity \nwithin the LBDC CCA including (i) increased cropping intensity, (ii) increased yields, and (iii) \ncrop diversification. Benefits are anticipated to increase to their full potential over 10 years with \ncropped area and yield figures being interpolated in a linear fashion between years 1 and 10. \nBenefits start to be realized in year 5 of the Project for the R&U of the barrage, and in year 6 \nfrom increased productivity within the LBDC. The R&U is assumed to enable the LBDC to safely \n ", "50        Appendix 8           \npass its maximum flow allocation of 278 cumecs when completed; an increase from the current \nmaximum of about 244 cumecs. Distribution of water supply will be improved through canal \nR&U. The Project is assumed to have a 30-year life, although R&U of some infrastructure \nshould yield benefits far longer than this. \n \n116.  Agricultural Productivity Benefits and Assumptions. To assess crop production and \nprojections, field surveys throughout the LBDC CCA were conducted during project preparation, \nand secondary data sources such as the Punjab Agriculture Census (2000) were consulted. \nBased on the analysis, cropping intensity is projected to continually increase from about the \ncurrent 162% to 172% with the Project. Without the Project, cropping intensity is assumed to \ndecrease by 1%, although this may be much greater if groundwater tables continue to fall. Crop \nyields are anticipated to increase from about 2% to 7% depending on the location within the \nLBDC. Crops currently with the greatest deficiencies in crop water requirements, which may be \nup to 30%\u201340% for cotton and wheat in some parts of the LBDC, will experience the greatest \ngains. Accordingly, cotton is anticipated to increase by 7%, potatoes by 5%, and wheat by 4.5%. \nMaize and most other crops are anticipated to increase by around 3%. The cropping intensity \nand yields are based on a weighted average of the three defined reaches of the distribution \nsystem: head, middle-tail, and saline-tail. Diversification to high-value crops is also anticipated \nunder the Project due to the greater reliability of water.

Incremental Production. The production of crops was calculated by multiplying unit \narea  yield  with  area  planted  under  those  crops.  Slight  decreases  anticipated in  the  head \nreaches for fodder (sorghum) and vegetables were attributed to assumed crop diversification. In \nthe lower reaches including the saline areas, the production is likely to increase. Area under \nsugarcane and orchards is likely to increase owing to high returns and soil/climatic suitability. \nWithout the Project, production is likely to slightly decrease for all crops, particularly in the tail-\nsaline area. Incremental production is computed as the difference between with and without the \nProject at full development. \n ", "Appendix 8        51 \n \n118.  Barrage Benefits and Assumptions. Barrage benefits are based on (i) damage to the \nBalloki Barrage and related infrastructure during an extreme flood event and reduced irrigation \nsupply to the LBDC and irrigation areas supplied by the Balloki\u2013Sulemanki Link Canal; (ii) \nflooding  of  adjacent  areas  upstream  of  the  barrage  due  to  forced  breaching  of  the  right \nembankment during floods to protect the Balloki Barrage and losses from damage to crops, \nassets, and infrastructure; and (iii) disruption to traffic on the Faisalabad road during floods.  \n \n119.  The  following  assumptions  were  made  in  quantifying  the  barrage  benefits.  If  fully \nbreached,  complete  reconstruction will  take  place  in 3  years,  and  the  LBDC  and  Balloki\u2013\nSulemanki link systems will encounter water shortage for the same period.4 This will result in (i) \nincremental  costs  of  groundwater  pumping  to  substitute  for  canal  water;  (ii)  reduction  of \ncropping intensity by 7.5% in the first 3 years due to water shortage, with cropping intensity \ngradually restored during the next 6 years; (iii) 20% reduction in irrigation applications causing \n10% yield loss; and (iv) reduction of number of tubewells by 50% due to lowered water table \nand replacement with turbine pumps. A 5% reduction in the gross margins is assumed as \nfarmers use more brackish or marginal quality groundwater in the middle and tail sections of the \nLBDC. The avoided costs of these changes were calculated as part of barrage benefits. The \nestimation of direct damage caused by breaching the right upstream embankments to pass \nfloods is based on loss of crops, private assets, and public infrastructure was based on an area \nof 8,868 ha from historical flooding. Flooding of the road to Faisalabad causes traffic diversion \nresulting in loss of bridge tolls and higher transportation costs by freight trucks due to alternate \nincreased travel distances. The avoided losses are used as benefits for 3 years following the \nbarrage failure. \n \nE.  Project-Wide Analysis \n \n120.  Economic Analysis. To assess the economic performance of the entire LBDCIP, the \neconomic benefits from increased agricultural productivity and from R&U of the Balloki Barrage \nand its related infrastructure were aggregated. The benefits of all other LBDCIP components \nwere subsumed into the LBDCIP benefits in terms of water-use efficiency and yield gains. The \neconomic internal rate of return; net present value at 12% discount rate, which is assumed to be \nthe opportunity cost of capital; and benefit-cost ratios were calculated using the economic base \nproject  costs  (total  cost  excluding  contingencies).  Table  A8.2  presents  the  results  of  the \neconomic analysis, showing that the LBDCIP is economically feasible and generates benefits in \nexcess  of  costs  with  a  benefit-cost  ratio  of  1.96.  A  sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  by \ndecreasing benefits and increasing costs by 20%; the economic internal rate of return is robust \neven when costs increase and benefits decrease. \n \nTable A8.2: Results of Economic Analysis  \nItem  EIRR  NPV (PRs, m)  Benefit-Cost Ratio\nBase Case  19.1% 8,033  1.96 \nSensitivity Analysis       \nCost Increases by 20%  17.1% 6,353  1.63 \nBenefits Decrease by 20%  16.7% 4,746  1.57 \nCost Increases by 20% and Benefits Decrease by 20% 14.7% 3,066  1.30 \nSwitching Value at 12% Opportunity Cost of Capital  \nIncrease in Total Cost  87% \nDecrease in Benefits  47%     \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, PRs, m = Pakistani rupees, in millions \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n                                                 \n4  About one third of the supply is assumed to be provided with a temporary structure during construction. \n ", "52        Appendix 8           \n \n121.  Financial Analysis. Table A8.3 indicates that the Project is financially feasible; the \nfinancial internal rate of return is well above 12% with a benefit-cost ratio of 1.82. A sensitivity \nanalysis was conducted by decreasing benefits and increasing costs by 20%. The financial \ninternal rate of return is robust above a 12% return in all cases except the combined increase in \ncosts and decrease in benefits where it dips slightly below to 11.8%, but the financial returns will \nbe important to LBDC farmers. \n \nTable A8.3: Results of Financial Analysis \n  FIRR (%) NPV (PRs, m)  Benefit-Cost Ratio\nBase Case  16.1  4,458  1.47 \nSensitivity Analysis       \nCost Increases by 20%  14.1  2,576  1.23 \nBenefits Decrease by 20%  13.7  1,684  1.18 \nCost Increases by 20% and Benefits Decrease by 20% 11.8  (198)  0.98 \nSwitching Value at 12% Opportunity Cost of Capital  \nIncrease in Total Cost   47 \nDecrease in Benefits  32     \n FIRR = financial internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, PRs, m = Pakistani rupees, in millions \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n122.  Farmer Benefits Based on social and land tenure data gathered during preparation of \nthe LBDCIP, the Project will have an important impact on rural incomes and rural poverty. About \n275,000 farm families live in the LBDC command area with an average family size of 6.8, so the \nProject will impact nearly 2 million people. Land ownership is skewed, with about 12% of farm \nfamilies holding nearly 45% of the farm area in the medium- to large-farm category (farm size is \nabove 5 ha). Their average landholding is 9.6 ha. However, the vast majority are smaller farms \nbelow 5 ha, which is about 55% of the LBDC command area, 88% of all farms, and owned by \nabout 240,000 farm families (1.65 million people). The average landholding within this group is \n1.6 ha. Based on this, a representative small-farm model was created to simulate the project \nimpact on a 1.64 ha average farm. Based on this model, the gross margin of the average small \nfarm will see an annual increase in income from about $1,204 to $1,284 or an annual increase \nof income of 7% at full development. Within the LBDC, about 20% of the command area is \noccupied by farms that are less than 2 ha, yet due to the skewed land tenure this 20% of the \narea supports 58% of the farms and farm families or over 1 million people. The average \nlandholding for this group of farmers is 0.9 ha; many of these farmers are operating at a \nsubsistence level. Project impacts were simulated on a small farm (0.91 ha) in the tail-saline \nportion of the command area. Under the Project, this farmer will see an annual increase in gross \nmargins from about $694 to $772, or an annual increase of income of 11% at full development. \nProject benefits will thus have the greatest impact on farmers who are currently the worst off in \nthe LBDC. \n \n19.  Risk Analysis. Most benefits come from incremental agricultural production. The Project \nis more sensitive to a decrease in benefits than to an increase in costs; thus loss or delay of \nbenefits poses the largest risk. The comprehensive and integrated approach of the Project helps \nto mitigate this risk. The Project addresses water management at all levels including the canal \nsystem,  on-farm  water  management,  and  groundwater  management  to  ensure  that \nsupplemental irrigation water and improved conveyance efficiency result in water reaching the \nroot  zone  of  the  plant  and  greater  productivity.  In  addition  to  improved  water  supply  and \nmanagement, the Project includes support for agricultural support services that will help farmers \nmake the best use of the improved irrigation water to achieve productive benefits. \n \n ", "Appendix 8        53 \n20.  Additional Benefits. In addition to the quantified benefits in the analysis, the PIAIP and \nthe LBDCIP have other benefits that are not quantified, but will help ensure a robust economic \nand financial return. The institutional changes will enhance irrigation service delivery, especially \nO&M, improving water distribution with important equity and productivity gains; however, project \nbenefits are not directly contingent upon the institutional reforms. Emphasis on the management \nof groundwater will ensure that this resource is conserved and used in a sustainable manner, \nwhich will reduce pumping costs to farmers and ensure current cropping intensity can be \nmaintained. \n ", "54        Appendix 9           \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan:  \nLand and water resources are among Pakistan\u2019s most valuable assets and fundamental to the agriculture sector, \nparticularly in Punjab. The province\u2019s irrigation system is the largest in Pakistan, but due to deterioration caused by \nneglect and inadequate resources, requires rehabilitation. The Program will address these problems starting with its \nfirst intervention in the Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) command area, not only to benefit landowners with access to \nirrigation, but to improve management of irrigation systems by farmers, benefiting share croppers and the landless. \nSeventy percent of the LBDC population is rural, depending almost entirely on agriculture for its livelihood. Irrigated \nagriculture is vital to sustain the livelihood base, and surface water an essential source, particularly in areas suffering \nfrom groundwater contamination. \n \nPunjab is the most agriculturally productive province in Pakistan. Despite being labeled the \u201cbread basket\u201d of Pakistan, \nit has a surprisingly high incidence of poverty at 32.4% of the rural and 26.5% of the urban population. While Punjab \nhas districts producing the most food surplus in all of Pakistan, it also demonstrates high intensities of food insecurity, \nparticularly in rural areas. The Pakistan Human Condition Report (2002) states that the incidence of food insecurity in \nrural Punjab increased during 5 years, from 24.5% of the rural population in 1993/1994, to 35.8% by 1998/1999. By \n2003, rural communities in the four districts in the LBDC command area were experiencing food insecurity: Khanewal \nthe highest intensity at 37% of the rural population; Kasur at 33.8%; Sahiwal at 33.6%; and Okara at 32.4%. \n \nLandholdings have fragmented due to inheritance patterns, while parts of the command area are affected by water \nand soil salinity. Coupled with insecurity of surface water supply, these factors have contributed to degradation of land \nresources, causing land shortages, increased marginalization of small farmers, and increased stress migration of \nworking males in some parts of the command area. In response to these factors, the intensity of agriculture has \nincreased to squeeze more productivity out of land that is becoming less productive. Cropping intensity in the area has \nincreased over time from the historical design of about 60% to 70% to close to 160%, placing excess demand on \nirrigation water. Shortage of irrigation water is particularly acute in the tail reaches of canals where limited or often no \nwater at all reaches farmers. In response to the need for additional water, farmers have installed tubewells, which has \nin some cases accelerated degradation of land resources through increased salinity from saline groundwater, and \nwater tables have been dropping, increasing the pumping costs for farmers who own wells and the remaining farmers \nwho are forced to purchase tubewell water. As the water table continues to drop, only more expensive turbine pumps \nwill be viable, favoring better-off farmers. The Project will stem this downward cycle through improved surface water \nirrigation supplies, reduce the amount of groundwater needed, as well as stabilize the groundwater table to allow \nsustainable exploitation of this vital resource for all farmers.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                      Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nApart from the general assessment of poverty and its characteristics, the required poverty analysis has addressed the \nlinkages between the rural poor and irrigated agriculture, and the needs of poor agriculture-dependent households. \nThe Project comprises a number of elements that will have direct benefits for the poor. \n \nA  social  and  poverty  assessment  was  carried  out  for  each  of  the  subprojects  in  compliance  with  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Guidelines on the Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations (1993). It included \nan assessment of the incidence of poverty, which revealed the nature and perceptions of its causes: (i) gender bias, \n(ii) landholding fragmentation, (iii) inequitable access to infrastructure and facilities, (iv) poor health, (v) basic needs \nnot met (health, nutrition, education), and (vi) lack of alternative livelihoods to agriculture.   \n \nThe social analysis identified especially vulnerable groups within the population, who would be unable to benefit fully \nfrom project interventions without some social preparation. These include (i) households headed by women, (ii) \nlandless, (iii) marginal farmers owning less than 2 hectares (ha) of land, (iv) tenants and sharecroppers dependent on \nless than 2 ha of land, and (v) landless persons living on and using right-of-way land. The Project will ensure that \nservices delivered through the field programs under the on-farm water management and agriculture component will \nhave programs targeted for marginal and landless farmers. \n \n ", "Appendix 9         55 \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nStakeholders, beneficiaries, and people directly affected have been consulted, and will continue to be consulted during \nfinalization of project design and implementation. A participatory and consultative methodology was adopted to \nundertake social analysis during the project preparatory technical assistance. It involved (i) initial field reconnaissance \ndiscussions with project stakeholders, (ii) focus group discussions with women in core subproject areas, (iii) detailed \nhousehold survey with male respondents in core subproject areas, (iv) key informant interviews, and (v) detailed \nsurvey questionnaires of households directly affected by land acquisition and civil works on the rights-of-way. \n \nDuring project implementation, the participation of stakeholders will be supported and deepened with the assistance of \nkey project staff and local nongovernment organizations. Communication strategies will be developed for farmers \nconcerning schedules of canal closures. A dedicated resettlement cell will be part of the project management unit to \nensure resettlement activities are addressed according to ADB guidelines. Farmers organizations will be an output of \nthe Project so the Project is inherently participation oriented, and the farmer organizations will ensure close linkages \nare established between the project implementation team and the community. The Project will ensure a participatory \napproach  to  detailed  design  of  the  irrigation  works,  and  the  institutional  capacity  of  farmer  organizations  will \nsubsequently be developed to facilitate sustainable operation and maintenance of the irrigation system. Community \nfacilitators will be responsible for identifying and assisting disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. \n \nParticipation Strategy required: Yes, included in resettlement and participatory development activities. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: The social analysis confirmed that women from poor households are \nproportionately at greater disadvantage. Compared to women in households headed by men, households headed by \nwomen are especially vulnerable: they have a lower level of education; inadequate adult labor; limited access to land, \ncredit, and agricultural extension; and lower income. A high proportion lives below the poverty line.   \n \nA gender strategy will be developed in the first year of the Project, ensuring the implementation of gender-sensitive \nactivities to be delivered through the on-farm water management and agriculture component. In addition to these \ntargeted components, mainstream gender activities will take place through the Project. Women\u2019s groups will be \nformed during implementation of civil works in the minor and distributary canals for consultation about the placement \nof minor infrastructure such as bridges and required access points for washing or other nonirrigation uses. An \ninternational gender specialist has been hired to assist with developing these activities and a full-time domestic gender \nspecialist will support these activities throughout implementation of the Project.

Environmental  Assessment.    All  tranches  and  their  associated  projects  and \nsubprojects under the Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program (PIAIP) will be given an \nenvironmental categorization independent of previous tranches, The Government of Punjab will \nensure that an environmental impact assessmemt (EIA) or initial environmental examination \n(IEE)  is  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  requirements  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Environment Policy. The Government of Punjab will ensure that all \nEIAs and/or IEEs are approved by ADB and that relevant government agencies adhere to them \nduring design, construction, and operation phases. \n \n2.  The Lower Bari Doab Canal Improvement Project (LBDCIP) will be the first activity \nfinanced under the PIAIP and is classified as category B in accordance with ADB guidelines. \nEnvironmental impacts were assessed through a full EIA, as required by the Punjab provincial \ngovernment due to the presence of two protected areas within the project area, the fact that the \nproject area is larger than 20,000 hectares (ha), and resettlement is expected. The Project is not \nexpected to have major or long-term adverse impacts, and negative impacts are expected to be \nonly temporary and mainly associated with construction, or will be mitigated during the life of the \nProject. The Project is expected to have an overall positive impact, through improved water \nresource management from the main LBDC system down to the on-farm level. Significant \nproject benefits are expected, as the activities will help reverse the present trend of falling \ngroundwater tables and reduce groundwater salinity. \n \n3.  The Project\u2019s EIA was carried out following the rules and regulations of the Pakistan \nEnvironmental  Protection  Act  (1997),  Pakistan  EIA  Review  Regulations  (2000),  Pakistan \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Procedures  (1997),  and  ADB  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines (2003). These were followed as a minimum, and various other guidelines were \nconsulted and followed during the course of the study. The EIA study components included \nscoping, screening, stakeholder consultation, secondary and primary data collection, review of \nalternatives,  identification  and  assessment  of  impacts,  recommendations  for  mitigation \nmeasures, and development of an environmental monitoring plan (EMP) and environmental \nassessment framework (EAF) (Supplementary Appendix C for the EIA, EMP, and EAF). The \nactivities for preparation of the EIA satisfy all ADB procedures for a category A project. \n \n4.  Public  Consultation.  Extensive  public  consultations  were  held  with  various \nstakeholders  including  local  communities,  government  agencies,  and  nongovernment \norganizations. A number of workshops were organized. Public workshops and general meetings \nwere held in (i) Sahiwal on 14 July and 12 August 2006, (ii) Miachannu on 14 August 2006, and \n(iii) a civil society workshop was held with nongovernment organizations and stakeholders in \nLahore on 4 August 2006. Surveys of the current environmental situation were undertaken as \npart of the preparation of the EIA, and a wide cross-section of stakeholders\u2019 concerns and \nsuggestions  were  recorded  and  incorporated  into  the  EIA.  Following  EIA  submission  for \napproval by the Environmental Protection Department, a public hearing will be held. Prior to the \npublic hearing, the department will circulate copies of the EIA to the concerned agencies. \n \nA.  The Project Area \n \n5.  LBDC Physical Environment. The LBDC command area, approximately 700,000 ha, is \npart of a vast plain of alluvial deposits from tributary rivers of the Indus. The command area is \nbounded by the Ravi River in the north and the Sukh Beas drainage channel in the south. The \nUpper Bari Doab Canal command area forms its north-eastern boundary and the Sidhnai Canal \ncommand forms the south-western boundary. The climate of the project area is characterized by \n ", "58        Appendix 10           \nhot summers and moderate and pleasant winters. The average annual rainfall varies from 650 \nmillimeters (mm) for Lahore in the east, to 210 mm in the southwest for Multan. \n \n6.  The LBDC overlies a large groundwater aquifer, which is made up of alluvial sediments \ndeposited through the river system. The depth of the water table has changed significantly due \nto irrigation system construction in the area. Before the irrigation system, the water table was at \nan average depth of about 30 meters (m), but it rose to 0\u20131.5 m in certain parts of the command \narea due to seepage from the canal system, and caused significant land degradation. Due to \nthe  rampant  growth  of  tubewells  over  the  last  decades,  the  groundwater  table  has  been \ndropping,1 as evidenced by the decrease in the amount of water-logged areas: from 10% in \n1962\u20131965 to virtually 0% in 2001/2002. The total number of private tubewells in the command \narea is estimated to be around 48,000. The command area is a conjunctive-use farming system \ndue to growing cropping intensity and demand for canal water; reliance on groundwater has \nincreased over the years. Presently groundwater abstraction is estimated to be around 4,564 \nmillion cubic meters per year, accounting for more than 50% of crop water requirements.  \n \n7.  The main surface water resource in the project area is the canal irrigation system. The \nLBDC exits the left bank of Ravi River at the Balloki Barrage. The current canal design capacity \nis 244 cumecs against a sanctioned discharge of 278 cumecs. Any shortfall in irrigation is met \nby  pumping  groundwater  and  occasional  rainfall,  although  overall  the  system  is  in  deficit. \nPollution in Ravi River is the highest of any river in Punjab. Most wastewater discharges in the \nriver reach between Lahore and the Balloki Barrage Complex. The Ravi receives untreated \nwastewater from the city of Lahore through a number of discharge points. The industries located \nin the city also discharge their untreated wastewater into the system; during low flows the river \nhas a high concentration of wastewater effluent. \n \n8.  The current macro habitats within the project area include agricultural lands, wetlands \n(including  the  reservoir,  canal  system,  and  small  water  impoundments),  and  forests \n(Chichawatni and Khanewal plantations\u2014the protected areas). Agricultural land occupies more \nthan 90% of the project area. The current habitats are a modification of an old land use regime \nwhere the area supported tropical plains thorn forests, mainly comprising woodlands. These \nwoodlands were subjected to heavy grazing and uncontrolled felling of trees, and were further \nmodified by the introduction of the canal irrigation system in the early 1900s. \n \n9.  Due  to  long-term  anthropogenic  disturbance,  the  area  has  limited  value  for  fauna. \nHowever, the two protected areas within the LBDC command area, the Chichawatni and the \nPirowal forest plantations, are both classified as wildlife sanctuaries under provincial law and \ncover an area of approximately 4,610 ha and 4,800 ha and have a protective buffer zone of 4.8 \nkilometers. Kharal Lake, previously a wildlife sanctuary, has recently been declassified due to \ntotal desiccation of the lake.  \n \n10.  Human Environment. The population of the area is about 4.5 million to 5.0 million. The \naverage population growth rates in the districts covering the command area vary from 2.4 to 3.3. \nThe average family size is 8.6. Population density is very high throughout the command area, \namong the highest in Punjab. The bulk of the population is located in Khanewal. The project \narea is characterized by numerous identity groups, organized into biraderis (clans). The biraderi \nremains important in demarcating social and economic relationships. Respondents during social \nsurveys confirmed that the biraderi still defines what they do and who they do it with. The nature \nof inter-biraderi relationships is commonly cooperative. Mostly farmers from the same biraderi \n                                                 \n1  In 1990, the LDC had about 10,000 tubewells; in 2005 this number was estimated to be 48,000. \n ", "Appendix 11         59 \nsettle around a water course; however, this pattern varies and is most dominant in the Sahiwal \ndivision. Dispute resolution is also through biraderis and formal institutions are rarely accessed. \n \n11.  The project area has better than average access to facilities such as schools, health \nunits, hospitals, and animal extension services compared to most of Punjab. Electricity and \npublic transportation are also generally available. However, the level of access and service \nvaries between villages, and between facilities as well. Sanitation conditions are very poor, with \nfew covered sewerage systems. In urban areas adjacent to the main LBDC, open sewers \ndischarge into the canal. The project area is a part of the Indus Valley civilization, which is one \nof the world's first urban civilizations. Three major sites of archaeological interest are in the \nproject area: Bawani, Harappa, and Tulamba. \n \n12.  Almost 94% of the farms in the command area are less than 10 ha. The number of large \nfarms (> 10 ha) and the amount of land cultivated by them has reduced over the years. The land \ntenure system is characterized by owner, owner-and-tenant, and tenant farmers. More than \n60% of the farms and 53% of the farm area is cultivated by the owners. \n \nB.  Project Impacts \n \n13.  The impacts were identified and assessed for their significance keeping in view their \nlikelihood,  consequence,  reversibility,  duration,  location,  and  timing.  Where  necessary  or \npossible,  the  impacts  of  construction  and  postconstruction  (operation)  were  assessed \nseparately. The EIA includes recommendations for mitigation, management, and monitoring \nmeasures based on best practices. \n \n14.  Groundwater and Irrigation Water Supplies. Groundwater pumping has resulted in a \ndecline in the groundwater table by about 0.37 meters per year across the command area.2 If \nthe water table continues to fall at this rate, many centrifugal pumps (those that currently supply \ntubewells) will no longer be viable, and only turbine pumps that are more expensive to purchase \nand operate will be viable. This change would (i) favor more wealthy farmers who could make \nthe investment in turbine pumps, (ii) increase the cost of groundwater to farmers who purchase \nwater, and (iii) possibly limit groundwater availability for farmers who are currently reliant on it.  \n \n15.  Due to the abstraction of groundwater and the falling water table, saline and water-\nlogged areas within the command area have been reduced from 17% to less than 5% in the last \n10 years. However, the overdraft of groundwater in freshwater zones may lead to the lateral \nmigration and intrusion of saline groundwater into freshwater zones, which could ultimately \nrender it unfit for drinking and irrigation. Additional canal supplies through the Project will \nprovide more water to the command area; the additional water is expected to increase recharge \nto the water table and offset the current imbalance (where withdrawals exceed recharge). If the \nsituation is reversed where recharge exceeds abstraction, the water table could start to rise and \npossibly cause soil salinity and water logging. \n \n16.  A return to high water tables is considered very improbable due to the current pumping; \nthe additional canal supplies are expected to enable (i) increased cropping in the command \narea, and (ii) increased pumping of groundwater. Groundwater levels will be monitored during \nthe Project under the groundwater component and if the groundwater table starts to rise to \nwhere it poses dangers, mitigation measures such as increasing the share of groundwater \nwithin the conjunctive-use system and reducing canal water supplies to that particular area will \nbe employed. \n                                                 \n2  Severe drought occurred from about 2000 to 2003. \n ", "60        Appendix 10           \n \n17.  Protected Areas. Impacts on the protected areas (Chichawatni and Pirowal plantation \nforests) and their buffer zones are minimal. The main canal or the construction works will not \nencroach into the Pirowal plantation areas, which are more than 1 km from the main canal. The \nmain canal will not encroach or enter the Chichawatni plantation as a result of canal widening, \nas the canal right-of-way within this reach is at least 100 m from the canal centerline, leaving a \nstrip of at least 50 m on either side of the canal, which is sufficient to accommodate the \nproposed canal widening. No civil works are proposed for the distributaries within the areas. \nPotential impacts will be limited to temporary disturbance to wildlife during construction works. \nRecommended measures to minimize noise, wastes, and impacts on wildlife and vegetation will \nmitigate impacts. Wildlife surveys will be undertaken before, during, and after construction to \nascertain the level of impacts and adopt any required additional mitigation measures. As per the \nPunjab Wildlife Act (1974), no person can enter or reside in a wildlife sanctuary or the buffer \nzone of a wildlife sanctuary that extends 3 miles from the boundary on all sides. Prior to \nconstruction activities, the boundary of the protected areas will be identified and marked with \nsign boards.  \n \n18.  Tree Felling. A potential impact will be the felling of trees along the main canal due to its \nwidening and/or reinforcement. The total number of trees is estimated at 62,000; however, \nmany will not be affected by the civil works, and most are second growth timber planted during \nthe canal construction. Felling of trees along the distributaries should be minimal, as less \nwidening is required for the civil works. Depending on the location of the trees, their removal \ncould benefit or negatively impact the integrity of the canal bank and all efforts will be made to \nmaximize safety. Removal of trees may cause disturbance to wildlife that rely on the trees. Prior \nto execution of civil works, an inventory of trees to be cut will be prepared with the assistance of \nthe forest officials, and a reforestation program will be prepared. The program will give details of \nthe species to be planted, number of saplings required, layout of the planting, operation and \nmaintenance requirements, and a detailed cost estimate. Budget is included for the reforestation \nprogram. \n \n19.  Fish. Fish stocks in Ravi River in Pakistan have declined over the years due to reduced \nflows; the Indus Water Treaty of 1960 gives the vast majority of the water rights of the Ravi to \nIndia (the Ravi only delivers about 5% of the supply to the LBDC and the rest is from diversions \nthrough the link canal system) and increased industrial and domestic pollution (from Lahore city \nand industrial areas). However, this impact has been muted at the Balloki Barrage Complex due \nto water received through the link canal system; fishing continues to result in productive catch \nfrom the area. The main canal is also stocked annually through the release of hatchlings. \nFishing rights are currently contracted and fish catch in the main canal takes place during \nclosure when all fish for that year are captured. \n \n20.  Reduction in fish stock due to construction activities is unlikely, however, temporary \ndisplacement of fish from the immediate area of the civil works within the barrage pond area \nmay occur. Most species of river fish spawn during the flood seasons with spawning grounds \nover the flood plain. In the Balloki Barrage Complex, this occurs upstream in the shallow \nconfines of the marginal bunds. Local fisherfolk confirm that fish spawning occurs mostly in \nshallow depths on the periphery of the pond area behind the barrage where vegetation cover is \nsuitable. Breeding and spawning occurs May through August, when fishing is not permitted. \n \n21.  After the rehabilitation works, the barrage may be operated at a finished surface level of \nthe pond of 193.2 m, which is an increase from the design finished surface level of 192.9 m for \nthe pond behind the Balloki Barrage Complex. The raising of the pond\u2019s finished surface level \n ", "Appendix 11         61 \nwill increase the backwater aerial coverage of the pond within the marginal bunds as well as the \nwater  depth  at  the  periphery  of  the  pond;  yet  the  possible  increase  will  not  diminish  the \nspawning sites. Currently, the Balloki Barrage Complex is operated at levels higher than 192.9 \nm (193.4 m recorded on 2 June 2006) and hence the possible new operating finished surface \nlevel will not be a significant change from the present conditions.  \n \n22.  The proposed rehabilitation and upgrading (R&U) works at the barrage lie outside of the \nfishing grounds and hence will not interfere with fishing activity, nor are they expected to reduce \nfish catch. Fishing in the main canal is normally only undertaken at the time of canal closure. \nThis is usually done in the first week after the canal closure, as after that the volume and quality \nof water cannot sustain fish life.  \n \nC.  Environmental Management and Mitigation \n \n23.  An EMP was prepared that addresses impacts of the Project to enhance project benefits \nand to introduce standards of good practice to be adopted for all project works. The EMP, along \nwith all other activities and outputs from the Project, also provide guidance for subsequent \nprojects to be taken up under the Program. The overall responsibility for compliance with the \nEMP rests on the Punjab Irrigation and Power Department (PIPD). The project management \nunit  (PMU)  will  be  headed  by  an  overall  project  director  who  will  be  assisted  by  five \ndepartmental directors. One of the directors will be the director, monitoring and evaluation, who \nwill oversee implementation and compliance with the EMP, as well as all resettlement activities. \nThis  director  will  be  assisted  by  a  dedicated  assistant  directors  for  the  environment  and \nresettlement, who will be recruited from the market and be specialists in their respective fields. \n \n24.  The PMU will be supported by consultants for design and supervision of the civil works. \nBoth the PMU and design and supervision consultants will have staff dedicated to environment \nand  resettlement  activities,  and  the  PMU  will  have  overall  responsibility  to  supervise  and \nmonitor environmental and social compliance of the civil works contractors. Each contractor will \nbe required to appoint a dedicated field environmental and social officer at the project site, who \nwill be responsible for ensuring implementation of the EMP. The EMP includes a mitigation \nprogram  that  lists  the  mitigation  measures  to  be  implemented  during  the  Project,  defines \nresponsibilities  for  implementation  of  the  mitigation  measures,  and  provides  rough  cost \nestimates for impact mitigation (which are included in the overall project costs). \n \n25.  The monitoring program will have two types of monitoring: compliance monitoring by the \nPMU, consultants, and contractors to ensure that the requirements of the EMP are being met; \nand effects monitoring to monitor unanticipated impacts of the Project. The effects monitoring \nprogram includes noise monitoring at selected construction sites; monitoring of groundwater \nlevel and salinity; fish surveys and wildlife surveys (in protected areas) to validate the EIA\u2019s \nassessment of impacts; and identification of any needed additional mitigation measures and/or \nsocial surveys for affected communities. \n \n26.  As part of the environmental preparations for the Project and the PIAIP, an EAF was \ndrafted. The EAF provides guidance for PIPD staff and consultants through detailed procedures \nfor assessing and mitigating environmental impacts to be integrated into subsequent projects \nunder the PIAIP, and for execution of the EMP for the LBDCIP. All processes and procedures in \nthe EAF will ensure compliance to Punjab government environmental policies and legislation \nand  ADB  environmental  safeguard  guidelines.  The  EAF  will  ensure  incorporation  of \nenvironmentally sound practices in the project design and mainstream environmental sensitivity \nin the PIPD. \n \n ", "62        Appendix 10           \n27.  The LBDCIP will support R&U of various water resources and irrigation, and will include \nactivities expected to have some limited environmental impacts such as the modernization of \nthe Balloki Barrage and other activities on a much smaller scale with relatively insignificant \nenvironmental impacts, such as remodeling existing smaller distributary systems. All of the \nproject activities are classified as category B and C, and IEE reports and a summary IEE will be \nprepared.  \n \nD.  Conclusions \n \n28.  The LBDCIP is anticipated to bring about a net-positive benefit in terms of improved \nwater  resource  management  (from  the  on-farm  level  through  to  the  LBDC  system)  and \nagricultural productivity in the area. Negative environmental and social impacts of the Project \nwill be associated with the construction phase, and will be temporary or reversible, phased, \nlocalized, and manageable. \n \n29.  The significant beneficial effects of the Project will be reversing the present trend of the \nfalling groundwater table and improving groundwater salinity levels through both increased \ncanal water recharge and reduced groundwater abstraction because of the increased canal \nwater supplies. The groundwater management component will support improved groundwater \nand conjunctive-use management and practices. Without the Project, the lowering groundwater \ntable and increasing salinity would mean a high risk to farmer livelihoods in the medium to long \nterm. \n \n30.  The Project will improve some of the social infrastructure, such as bridges, as part of the \nR&U of the irrigation structures, and will reduce the exposure of local communities to flooding \nevents  and  the  associated  social  and  economic  damages.  The  livelihoods  of  farming \ncommunities will also improve through increased and equitable canal water availability and \nimproved agricultural productivity through improved agricultural practices.  \n \n31.  The  Project  will  not  have  any  significant  impacts  on  fish,  fisher  communities,  and \nprotected  ecological  and  archaeological  sites.  However,  monitoring  measures  have  been \nrecommended to ensure that any unforeseen impacts can be identified and mitigated during \nimplementation. \n \n32.  The most serious impacts of the Project will be resettlement of affected communities, \nfelling of the canal-side tree plantation, and possible relocation of cultural sites that lie within the \ncanal right-of-way. Detailed action plans to mitigate these impacts guided by the EFA (and \nresettlement  framework)  will  be  developed  at  the  time  of  detailed  design.  Costs  for  a \nreforestation program are included in the EMP, alternatives to protecting cultural sites such as \nwidening the canal on the opposite bank, providing retaining structures, or using canal lining are \nrecommended in the EIA. \n \n33.  Implementation of and adherence to the EMP and compliance with the EAF will be \nnecessary to minimize adverse impacts and maximize positive gains. This will be ensured \nthrough extensive consultation with all project stakeholders, follow-up during construction to \nidentify and mitigate any impacts that might be unforeseen at this stage, and extensive capacity \ndevelopment for the PIPD. \n \n ", "Appendix 11         63 \nSUMMARY SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS \n \n1.  The Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Development Investment Program is proposed to be \nfinanced by a multitranche finance facility (MFF), with multiple loans to finance stand-alone \nprojects or portions of projects. Each project will support rehabilitation and upgrading (R&U) of \nirrigation and water resources infrastructure that is anticipated to require land acquisition and \nresettlement (LAR). The first activity to be supported under the Program will be the Lower Bari \nDoab Canal (LBDC) Improvement Project to be carried out in East Punjab. Under the R&U \ncomponent, LBDC civil works are subdivided into two subcomponents: (i) Balloki Barrage R&U; \nand (ii) canal network R&U inclusive of (a) main canal R&U and (b) distribution system R&U. The \nLBDC civil works will cause dispersed impacts on land, houses, and businesses; and some \nrelocation of people affected.  \n \nA.  General Procedures \n \n2.  The  LAR  will  follow  Pakistan  law  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  policy  on \ninvoluntary resettlement,1 and Operations Manual F2 on Involuntary Resettlement (2003). The \nappraisal of the MFF and each tranche, and the approval and implementation of each activity \ninvolving LAR will require the preparation and/or updating of the following documents: \n  \n(i)  a  resettlement  framework  for  the  whole  MFF  to  be  reviewed,  updated,  and \nsubmitted for ADB approval annually and before the preparation of each tranche; \n(ii)  an initial poverty and  social assessment indicating whether LAR impacts are \nexpected, and if so their type and magnitude for each tranche; and  \n(iii)  a  resettlement  plan  based  on  detailed  design/impact  figures  and  inclusive  of \ncompensation budgets and schedules for each subproject under a loan.2 \n \n3.  The appraisal of the MFF and of each periodic financing request and the approval and \nimplementation of each subproject under a loan will follow the following LAR-related conditions: \n \n(i)  MFF and tranche 1 appraisal conditional to preparation of (a) a resettlement \nframework for the whole MFF and (b) resettlement plans for the first project 1 \ncore-subprojects, both acceptable to ADB;  \n(ii)  Appraisal of other tranches conditional to (a) resettlement framework review \nand/or update, and (b) preparation of a resettlement plan for the projects and \nsubprojects presented with submission of the loan\u2019s periodic financing request; \nand \n(iii)  Start of all subproject civil works subject to ADB approval of the resettlement \nplan, however, affected people will be provided certain resettlement entitlements \nsuch as land and asset compensation and transfer allowances, prior to their \ndisplacement, dispossession, or restricted access. \n \n4.  To  fit  these  requirements,  the  Punjab  Irrigation  and  Power  Department  (PIPD),  the \nExecuting Agency, has prepared a resettlement framework and plans for the core subprojects \nunder the first loan. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1995. Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n2  Resettlement will be significant where 200 people or more experience major impacts. Major impacts are defined as \ninvolving affected people being physically displaced from housing and/or having more than 10% of their productive, \nincome generating assets lost. Compensation needs to be based on full replacement value. \n \n ", "64        Appendix 11           \nB.  Resettlement Framework \n \n5.  The resettlement framework lists the following principles: (i) LAR will be avoided or at \nleast  minimized,  (ii)  compensation  will  guarantee  the  maintenance  of  the  pre-project  living \nstandards of those affected, (iii) people affected will be fully informed/consulted on compensation \noptions, (iv)  sociocultural institutions of those affected will be supported and used, (v) LAR \nprovisions  will  equally  apply  to  women  and  men,  (vi)  lack  of  formal  title  will  not  impede \ncompensation/rehabilitation,  (vii)  particular  attention  will  be  paid  to  households  headed  by \nwomen and vulnerable groups, (viii) LAR will be conceived and executed as an integral part of \nthe Project and LAR budgets will be included in project costs, and (ix) compensation will be fully \nprovided prior to ground leveling and demolition. The framework also covers all issues relevant \nfor the effective conduction of LAR tasks as required by ADB policy and sets the eligibility and \nentitlement provisions outlined in Table A11.  \n \nTable A11: Compensation Entitlements Matrix \nAsset a  Specification  Affected People  Compensation Entitlements \nPermanent  All land losses  Farmer/titleholder  Land-for-land  compensation  in  plots  of  equal \nImpact on  independent from  value/productivity or; cash compensation at replacement \nArable Land  impact severity  cost based on market valueb free of taxes, registration, \nand transfer costs plus 15% compulsory land acquisition \nsurcharge. \nLeaseholder  Lease renewal in other plots of equal value/productivity, \n(registered or not)  or cash equal to market value of gross yield of affected \n  land  for  the  remaining  lease  years  (up  to  a  3  year \nmaximum). \nSharecroppers  Cash compensation equal to market value of the lost \n(registered or not)  harvest  share  once  (temporary  impact)  or  twice \n(permanent impact)  \nAgriculture workers  Cash  indemnity  corresponding  to  salary  (including \nlosing their contract  portions in kind) for the remaining part of the agricultural \nyear. \nSquatters  1 rehabilitation allowance equal to market value of 1 \ngross harvest (in addition to crop compensation) for land \nuse loss.  \nAdditional  Farmer/titleholder  1  severe  impact  allowance  equal  to  market  value  of \nprovisions for  Leaseholder  gross harvest of the affected land for 1 year (inclusive of \nsevere impacts  winter and summer crop and additional to standard crop \n(>10% land loss)  compensation) \nSharecroppers  1 severe impact allowance equal to market value of \n(registered or not)  share  of  harvest  lost  (additional  to  standard  crop \ncompensation) \n    Squatters  1  severe  impact  allowance  equal  to  market  value  of \ngross harvest of the affected land for 1 year (inclusive of \nwinter and summer crop and additional to standard crop \ncompensation) \nResidential/    Titleholder  Land  for  land  compensation  in  a  plot  equal  in \nCommercial  value/location to plot lost or cash for affected land at full \nLand  replacement cost free of taxes, registration, and transfer \ncosts. \nRenter/Leaseholder  1\u20133 months allowance \nSquatters  Plot  in  a  public  resettlement  area  or  self-relocation \nallowance \nHouses and    All relevant people  Cash at replacement rates for affected house/structure \nStructures  affectedc  free  of  salvageable  materials,  depreciation,  and \n  transaction costs; for partial impacts full cash assistance \nto restore structure \nCrops  Crops affected  All people affectedc   Crop compensation in cash at full market rate for harvest \nactually lost (winter or summer crop or both as is the \ncase) \n ", "Appendix 11         65 \nAsset a  Specification  Affected People  Compensation Entitlements \nTrees  Trees affected  All people affectedc   Cash compensation will reflect income replacement \nBusiness  Temporary or  All people affectedc   Business owner: (i) Cash compensation equal to 1 year \nEmployment  permanent loss of  income, if loss is permanent; (ii) cash compensation for \nbusiness or  the period of business interruption, if loss is temporary \nemployment  Worker/employees: Indemnity for lost wages for the \nperiod of business interruption up to a maximum of 3 \nmonths  \nRelocation  Transport/transition  All people affected  Provision of sufficient allowance to cover transport \nlivelihood costs  by relocationc  expenses and livelihood expenses for 1 month \nCommunity      Rehabilitation/substitution of affected structures/utilities \nassets  (i.e., mosques, footbridges, roads, schools, health \ncenters) \nVulnerable    People affected  Employment priority in project-related jobs. \npeople  living below poverty \naffected  line \na  Other impacts so far identified may occur in noncore subprojects of the first loans or during core subproject \nimplementation.

Institutional Responsibilities. Overall LAR preparation, implementation, financing, and \ncoordination  responsibility  falls  on  PIPD,  which  will  exercise  these  functions  via  a  project \nmanagement unit (PMU), tasked with general project execution, and the project implementation \nunits (PIUs), tasked with activities at district level. At the PMU, LAR will be assigned to a LAR \nunit, handling and monitoring resettlement plan preparation, implementation, approval, and LAR \ncoordination. The LAR unit will be aided by a resettlement team under the PMU consultants, a \nnongovernment  organization,  or  a  national  consultant  hired  for  on-site  impact  surveys  and \nmonitoring  assistance.  The  PMU  will  coordinate  with  the  local  governments,  which  have \njurisdiction on land administration, valuation, and acquisition through two committees: (i) a LAR \nsteering committee (provincial) and a LAR coordination committee (district) ensuring provincial \nand district coordination. The LAR coordination committee will include members of communities \nwith people affected and their representatives, and will provide facilitation both during LAR \nimplementation and in the solution of complaints and grievances. Provincial LAR functions rest \nwith  the  Board  of  Revenue;  district  functions  with  the  district  collector  office  and  the  land \nacquisition collector. Minor agents, like the patwari, (records keepers), will identify and verify \ntitles. Compensation of assets other than land (buildings, crops, etc.) or income rehabilitation \nfalls on the relevant district department. ADB clearance of category B resettlement plans will \nhandled by a resettlement specialist hired at ADB\u2019s Pakistan Resident Mission.3 Category A \nprojects will be cleared at ADB headquarters. \n  \n7.  Disclosure/Public  Consultation.  Resettlement  plan  tasks  will  involve  intense \nconsultation with those affected. As an appraisal condition, the resettlement framework and \nrelevant  resettlement  plans  in  English  will  be  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website,  while  the \nresettlement  framework  and  resettlement  plans  in  local  language  will  be  disclosed  in  the \ncommunities of those affected. \n \n8.  Grievance Procedures. Individuals affected will first lodge a complaint with the land \nacquisition collector. If settlement is not reached within 15 days, the complaint will be sent to the \nPMU. If the grievance is still not settled within 1 month, the people affected can seek redress at \n                                                 \n3  To be confirmed prior to submission of first resettlement plan or optional approval mechanisms agreeable to RSDD \nwill be adopted.  \n ", "66        Appendix 11           \nthe appropriate court. The LAR coordination committee composed by senior members of the \ncommunities of people affected and by their elected representatives will assist the individuals \naffected in these cases.   \n \n9.   Monitoring and Evaluation. The PMU will internally monitor and report to PIPD on LAR \nimplementation. PIPD will report to ADB quarterly. PIPD will assign external monitoring to an \nindependent agency and external monitoring reports will be submitted to ADB twice a year. At \nthe end of project implementation, the independent monitoring agency will carry out a general \nevaluation of LAR implementation. \n \n10.  Finances  and  Schedules.  The  resettlement  framework  prescribes  that  each \nresettlement plan will detail LAR budgets and provide clear schedules linking LAR tasks with the \ninitiation of civil works. \n \nC.  Indigenous Peoples Issues  \n12.  No impacts on indigenous peoples are expected as the Program will be implemented in \nPunjab where no resident population fits the ADB definition of indigenous peoples. \nD.  Specific Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plans  \n \n11.  Two  core-subprojects  with  LAR  have  been  prepared  as  a  condition  for  tranche  1 \nappraisal, namely: Distributary System 15-L and the Main Canal Rehabilitation Works at Shaiwal \ntown  (Shaiwal  town  subproject).  For  both,  a  resettlement  plan  fitting  ADB\u2019s  policy  and \nresettlement framework requirements has been prepared.  \n \n12.  The 15-L Distributary system will affect 1.920 m2 ha of residential land occupied by 15 \nhouses, 38 commercial establishments, 36 sheds, 41 kiosks, 13 stalls, and 23 minor structures, \nwhich  will  be  compensated  at  replacement  cost.  As  all  these  buildings  are  built  on  public \npremises, land will be compensated through land-for-land mechanisms. A total of 1,400 m2 of \nland has been earmarked in various areas of the Project to be distributed as replacement plots. \nIn addition to private assets the Project will cause the relocation of two mosques and require the \ncompensation of two tubewells and three hand pumps. In all 112 families are affected (2,645 \nindividuals), of these 15 families will have to be resettled. LAR costs are assessed at $220,000.  \n \n13.  The Shaiwal Town subproject will affect 6,116 m2 of residential land occupied by 25 \nhouses, 27 commercial establishments, 13 sheds, 9 kiosks, 14 stalls, and 21 minor structures, \nwhich will be compensated at replacement cost. These buildings are built on public land, which \nwill be compensated with earmarked replacement plots for a total of 7,714 m2 and located in \nvarious areas of the city along the main canal. In addition to private assets, the Project will cause \nthe  relocation  of  one  mosque,  two  Imam  Barghas,  and  one  shrine;  and  will  require  the \ncompensation of several electrical and telephone poles. In all 108 families are affected (867 \nindividuals), of these 25 will have to be resettled. LAR costs are assessed at $305,000. \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20061215141759+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20061120182707+08'00'", "Title": "Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0.1 (Windows)"}, "author_page": "GLOSSARY \n \n  abiana  \u2013  irrigation service fee  \n  biraderi  \u2013  clan \n  conjunctive use  \u2013  use of surface water and groundwater to meet water needs in \nthe same geographic area \n  rabi  \u2013  crop growing season from about October to March \n  khal panchayat    water user association based on a common irrigation field outlet \nfrom the canal \n  kharif  \u2013  crop growing season from about April to September \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government of Pakistan ends on 30 June. \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \nVice President  L.
