INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2007  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to assist the Qinghai \nProvincial Department of Water Resources (QDOWR) to prepare the Qinghai Rural Water \nResources Management Project, which is included in the PRC\u2019s country partnership strategy \n(2008\u20132010).1 ADB  fielded  a  Fact-Finding  Mission  in  March  2008  for  formulating  project \npreparatory technical assistance. The Mission visited the project area; held discussions with \ngovernment representatives from the central, provincial, county, and prefecture levels, as well \nas  with  development  partners  and  beneficiaries;  and  reached  preliminary  agreements  and \nunderstandings on the impact, outcome, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, and \nconsultant\u2019s terms of reference for the technical assistance (TA).2 The TA design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Rural Poverty and Irrigation. The PRC has developed rapidly during the last nearly \nthree decades, with its economy growing by approximately 9% per annum.3 In spite of this \ngrowth, however, the PRC continues to be a lower middle income country with a sizeable \nnumber of poor living on less than $1 a day. Low farm productivity, poor rural infrastructure, lack \nof access to rural finance, poor education and skills, and other constraints limit economic \nopportunities for the rural poor and leave them vulnerable to economic and social risks.  \n \n3.  Despite the PRC\u2019s strong and sustained economic growth, poverty is still widespread,  \nespecially in remote rural areas in the western regions. Most of the rural poor lack adequate \naccess to social services, including health care, education, water supply, and sanitation. The \nbasic factors causing poverty in rural areas are (i) heavy dependence on subsistence agriculture, \n(ii) inadequate physical infrastructure and human capital, (iii) insufficient government capacity, \nand (iv) lack of employment opportunities. Income inequalities between eastern and western \nPRC  have  risen,  and  the  income  gap  between  rural  and  urban  households  has  widened \nconsiderably since the late 1970s. Urban incomes are now more than three times higher than \nrural  incomes.  The  Government  is  taking  measures  to  correct  this  trend  by  increasing \ninvestments in rural areas, especially in rural infrastructure, education, and health. Similarly, \nhigh  priority  has  been  accorded  to  pro-poor  growth  in  rural  areas  through  aggressive \ninvestments  into  agriculture  and  rural  infrastructure,  including  irrigation.  Reducing  poverty \nremains a daunting challenge, however, as does raising the welfare of millions living just above \npoverty. To meet this challenge, it will be vital to sustain growth while addressing environmental \ndegradation, growing inequality, and the strain on resources. The initial poverty and social \nanalysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n4.  Irrigation and water management is essential to sustainable agriculture throughout the \nyear in most regions of the PRC. Meeting irrigation needs has become one of the major issues \nwithin the water sector. Irrigation represented 63.2% of total water use in 2006, a decrease from \n68.8% in 2000 due to the PRC\u2019s rapid urbanization, economic growth, and population growth. At \nthe same time, per capita water availability is rapidly declining as ecological and water stress is \nincreasing in many river basins. These combined factors have highlighted the need for more \nefficient  and  sustainable  water  resources  management,  particularly  for  the  purpose  of \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 May 2008. \n3  World Bank. 2008. Inclusive Growth for Harmonious Society in PRC. Washington D.C. \n ", "2   \nincreasing the irrigation water coefficient in order to meet the rising requirements of irrigation \nwater.  \n \n5.  The  Government  has  revised  the  National  Water  Policy  periodically  since  1998  to \naddress these challenges, promoting state level policy and institutional reforms to (i) manage \nwater efficiently using integrated water resources management (IWRM), and (ii) pursue higher \nsystem utilization and sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M) with participatory irrigation \nmanagement (PIM). These changes were further stipulated in the revised 2002 National Water \nLaw. While considerable progress has been made to implement PIM and IWRM, the process is \nstill in a formative stage. Also, provincial agencies are unable to deliver services with adequate \nparticipation from farmers. \n \n6.  Rural Economy and Agriculture in Qinghai. Qinghai is located in the Upper Yangtze \nand Yellow River valleys in the northeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. It is classified \nas a food deficit province, importing about 350,000 tons of grain annually. It is further classified \nas the second poorest province in the PRC. The province\u2019s relatively small population of 5.38 \nmillion is distributed over a large area covering 720,000 square kilometers, of which 20% is \nurban and 80% is rural. The bulk of the rural population is concentrated in farming areas in the \neastern region, which makes up only 5% of the province\u2019s total land area but feeds about 75% \nof its total population. Of the total population in the project area, 42.8% comprise ethnic minority \ngroups (Tibetan, Hui, and Sala). The per capita net income and consumption expenditure of \nfarmers in Qinghai in 2004 has been about two thirds of the national average.4 \n \n7.  To  enhance  agricultural  productivity,  Qinghai  Province  has  introduced  policies  to \nincrease cropping intensity and diversity through improved water management, input distribution, \nextension systems, and infrastructure. The agricultural tax has been lifted, and although there \nare still bottlenecks in extension systems, sporadic positive developments are evident in many \nplaces, and specifically where irrigation is assured along with good connectivity to markets. To \nimprove agriculture, concerted efforts are needed to (i) identify suitable area-specific farming \nsystems by analyzing local production, marketing conditions, and farmer incentives; (ii) set \nrealistic output targets; and (iii) define programs to address local constraints while meeting the \nspecific needs of the poor. \n \n8.  Status of Irrigation and Water Resources. The project area is in eastern Qinghai and \nis served by two main irrigation schemes in the valley of the Yellow River. The Lijiaxia and \nGongboxia irrigation schemes collectively cover the project counties of Hualong, Jianza, and \nXunhua. The existing schemes were built in the early 1970s and were designed to operate \nthrough lift irrigation. In recent times, however, rising electricity, water, and agricultural input \ncosts have been a major constraint on increased agricultural production. Many fertile upland \nagricultural lands lay fallow due to the rising costs of lift irrigation. The pumping stations have \nfallen into disrepair as a result of limited usage, and farmers are forced to find alternative \nsources of income (such as daily manual labor in the construction industry). Farming under \nthese conditions is no longer economically-feasible. \n \n9.  Policy and Institutional Level. With the support of other development partners, the \npolicy  and  institutional  environment  surrounding  water  resources  management  has  seen \nprogressive improvements in the last decade. In particular, (i) water policies and plans are in \nplace that have adopted key principles of PIM and IWRM, (ii) legislation has led to creating a \nwater users association (WUA) framework to implement PIM, (iii) the principle of full O&M \n                                                 \n4  National Bureau of Statistics. 2005. Yearbook of China\u2019s Statistics. Qinghai Provincial Statistic Bureau. \n ", "  3\nfinancing by beneficiaries has been adopted, and (iv) steps toward establishing institutions and \nfunctions for IWRM have been initiated on the basis of river basins. Although QDOWR has been \nstrengthened in accordance with national policies, there is still much progress to be made and it \nshould be noted that implementation of many of these reforms is still at an early stage. \n \n10.  Irrigation Service Delivery. The province has initiated steps to transfer minor irrigation \ncanal management to WUAs, subject to (i) WUA formation, (ii) establishment of an irrigation \nservice charge, and (iii) introduction of prerequisites (e.g., training) to initiate O&M by WUAs for \nthe transferred canals. Progress has been hampered, however, by the inability of WUAs to \nperform the required O&M work on their own. QDOWR and WUAs have still not reached an \nadequate  level  of  development  enabling  them  to  adequately  support  accountable  service \ndelivery  and  O&M  cost  recovery.  There  presently  exists  a  vicious  cycle  of  low  irrigation \nperformance and ad hoc collection of service charges that contributes to even lower overall \nirrigation performance. WUAs need strengthening for effective transfer of responsibilities. There \nis significant support for PIM, and QDOWR has established a good foundation. Still, QDOWR \nneeds to strengthen its analytical capacities to design and plan irrigation projects. \n \n11.  IWRM. In recognition of increasing competition for water, there is a need to further \noperationalize specific IWRM functions, including (i) participatory and holistic basin planning that \nincorporates  water  investments,  watershed  management,  agriculture,  and  other  support \nservices; and (ii) the introduction of regulatory functions for water use and quality management.  \n \n12.  Opportunities for ADB Support. The TA and ensuing investment project will support \nthe country partnership strategy (2008\u20132010), the Government\u2019s pro-poor economic growth \nstrategy, and the Government\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) by helping the rural poor boost \nproductivity  and  diversify  production  while  stimulating  off-farm  activity  through  rural \ninfrastructure such as irrigation. It will do so by (i) expanding access to sustainable irrigation \nthrough command area development and water resources management, (ii) strengthening farm-\nto-market linkages, and (iii) improving the enabling environment for agribusiness with particular \nemphasis  on  initiatives  by  women  and  disadvantaged  groups  by  strengthening  community \nempowerment. \n \n13.  In this context, QDOWR has requested ADB\u2019s support for irrigation infrastructure and \nagricultural  development  covering  physical  infrastructure  works  to  construct  four  irrigation \ncanals based on the already established outlets on the left and right dam shoulders in order to \nserve the water requirements to the farming communities flanked on either side. Because this \nwill have the effect of converting the existing lift irrigation schemes to provide gravity irrigation \nfor agricultural needs, an intervention proposal will be prepared. This proposal needs to show \nhigh returns and revenues while at the same time strengthening and operationalizing the policy \nand institutional framework for PIM and IWRM. The TA will support this process by assessing \nthe most effective way of addressing the aforementioned issues. It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s \nwater policy, which advocates a participatory approach to help conserve and protect water \nresources and foster integrated water resources management. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The expected impact of the TA will be rehabilitated and newly constructed key water \nresources infrastructure in the three participating counties of Qinghai Province. The TA outcome \nwill be a project design agreed by QDOWR, the Government, and ADB that will (i) enhance \n ", "4   \nproductivity and sustainability of existing irrigation systems with increased provincial revenues; \nand (ii) strengthen institutions, including QDOWR in delivering accountable irrigation services, \nWUAs in fulfilling specified O&M tasks, and other agencies in providing sound support services. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will have three specific outputs for the project area: (i) an irrigated agriculture \nstrategy and action plan, (ii) an institutional development strategy for PIM and IWRM with a \nprogram of capacity building and project management, and (iii) an investment proposal that \nmeets ADB\u2019s safeguards and other requirements.  \n \n16.  The TA will utilize (i) detailed subproject feasibility study reports prepared by QDOWR; (ii) \nexisting policy, planning, and institutional documents; and (iii) other information relating to the \nsector. Building on this information, the TA will carefully analyze local conditions while applying \nlessons and best practices learned in the PRC and other countries. A participatory approach will \nbe undertaken during project preparation. It will include workshops and focus group meetings \nwith key stakeholders\u2014including representatives of poor communities\u2014in order to address their \nneeds. In line with each output, TA activities will include: \n \n(i)  Initial assessments. The TA will provide support to conduct a baseline survey \ncovering social, poverty, and institutional capacity, and it will take into account \nlessons learned from similar ADB,5 World Bank, and other donor-funded projects. \nBased on the initial survey work, the TA will prepare (a) a preliminary project \ndesign  and  monitoring  framework;  (b)  safeguards  frameworks  (incorporating \nresettlement,  land  acquisition,  environment,  and  indigenous  peoples);  (c)  a \nproject implementation framework; and (d) an irrigated agriculture development \nstrategy with updated irrigation interventions. \n(ii)  Subcomponent proposal development. The subcomponent proposals will be \nreviewed and revised based on the baseline surveys, stakeholder consultations, \nand the irrigated agriculture development strategy to define specific components \nfor irrigation, agriculture, and associated services in accordance with the holistic \nstrategy outlined above. The TA will also help prepare a detailed institutional \ndevelopment action plan. \n(iii)  Development of an investment proposal. The consultant team will prepare a \ncomprehensive feasibility report covering (a) project impact, outcome, outputs, \nand  activities;  (b)  technical,  financial,  economic,  and  social  analyses  and \npreparation of social and environment safeguard documents; (c) relevant sector \nand  problem  analyses;  (d)  roles  and  institutional  capacities  of  participating \nagencies; (e) implementation arrangements; and (f) interrelated issues of poverty \nreduction,  gender  equality,  good  governance,  and  possible  private  sector \ndevelopment. In order to create a strong sense of ownership, investment plans \nmust be (a) consistent with government strategies and plans, and (b) endorsed \nby the key stakeholders (including the project beneficiaries). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $875,000 equivalent, of which $700,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program and administered by ADB. QDOWR will \n                                                 \n5  Lessons  from  ADB  projects  are  available  through  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Evaluation  Department\u2019s  Evaluation \nInformation System (EVIS): http://evis.adb.org. \n ", "  5\nfinance the remaining $175,000 equivalent for office space, counterpart staff, data analyses \n(including feasibility study reports), and other administrative costs. The Government has been \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  QDOWR will be the Executing Agency for the TA. It will appoint a full-time technical \ndirector at the level of chief engineer to support the project preparation. To guide TA activities, \nQDOWR will also form a project steering committee. Chaired by QDOWR\u2019s director general, the \ncommittee  will  include  specialists  in  agriculture,  watershed  management,  and  forestry \nnominated  by  the  departments  concerned.  At  the  outset,  QDOWR  will  provide  (i)  detailed \nfeasibility reports to be studied in detail under the TA, (ii) irrigation scheme inventories, (iii) \nsupport for baseline surveys and materials related to the sector and its policy and institutional \nframework, and (iv) assistance to the consultant team to organize meetings and workshops. \n \n19.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  6  months  from  September  2008  to \nFebruary  2009.  It  will  require  15  person-months  of  international  and  24  person-months  of \nnational consultants covering irrigation planning and management, irrigation institutions, PIM, \nIWRM,  agronomy,  agriculture,  economics,  sociology,  environment,  and  resettlement.  It  will \ninclude studies, surveys, and consultations. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix  4.  ADB  will  recruit  an  international  consulting  firm  in  association  with  national \nconsultants following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto  time)  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  engaging  national  consultants \nsatisfactory to ADB. The simplified technical proposal procedure will be followed, along with \nquality and cost-based selection at a quality:cost ratio of 80:20. The consultants will submit an \ninception report within 1 month, a midterm report within 4 months, and a draft final report within \n6  months.  Tripartite  meetings  between  Qinghai  provincial  government,  ADB,  and  the \nconsultants will be held to discuss these reports, which also will be presented in workshops with \nrelevant stakeholders. A final report will be submitted within 2 weeks after the Government, \nQinghai provincial government, and ADB comment on the draft final report. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for preparing the Qinghai Rural Water \nResources Management Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Data Sources and/or \nDesign  Assumptions  \nTargets and/or  Reporting \nSummary  and Risks  \nIndicators  Mechanisms  \nImpact      Assumption \nKey irrigation facilities  \u2022  By 2015, farm  \u2022  National and  \u2022 Ensuing investment \nconstructed and/or  household incomes  provincial statistics on  project will be feasible, \nrehabilitated in three  will increase by  agriculture, incomes,  well-designed, and \nparticipating counties in  about 20%.  and human  implemented effectively. \nQinghai Province.  \u2022  By 2015, poverty in  development index   \n  rural households will  \u2022  Budget monitoring  Risk \n  be reduced by about  and evaluation reports  \u2022 The central \n10%.  \u2022  Other relevant  Government\u2019s priorities \n\u2022  By 2015, food self- statistics including  will change or it will be \nsufficiency among  those relating to the  reluctant to accept the \nfarmers will increase  irrigation system  measures \nby about 20%.  maintained by  recommended. \nQDOWR   \nOutcome      Assumptions \nProject design and feasibility  \u2022  Agreement reached  \u2022  Memorandum of  \u2022 Government priorities for \nstudy acceptable to the  between the  understanding signed  the western region \nGovernment and ADB.

Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy (CPS) and the sector analysis, describe \nhow the project would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy \nof the partner country. \n \nDuring the 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005), the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) made remarkable progress in reducing \npoverty, with the number of rural poor falling from about 250 million in 1978 to 85 million in 1990 and 23.7 million in 2005. The \npopulation below the international standard of $1 per day (using purchasing power parity) fell from 374.8 million (33% of the \npopulation) in 1990 to 135 million (10% of the population) in 2005. Several non-income aspects of poverty have also improved, \nwith the PRC poised to achieve Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets for maternal health and primary education. More \ntargeted and innovative approaches are needed to address (i) persistent absolute poverty, increasingly concentrated in hard-\nto-reach groups (e.g., remote communities, the elderly, and disabled); (ii) the vulnerability of a large population living on the \nbrink of poverty; and (iii) new manifestations of urban poverty. Without dramatic improvements, the PRC might not achieve \nMDG targets for gender equity, environmental sustainability, child mortality, HIV/AIDS, and access to safe drinking water and \nsanitation. \n \nExperience in the PRC shows that poverty is both a cause and effect of environmental degradation. The poor, lacking the daily \nnecessities and basic means of livelihood, are forced to overexploit often fragile ecosystems. On the other hand, the poor have \noften to bear disproportionate impacts of ecological degradation. A sustainable development strategy has been included in the \n11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010), which emphasizes a \u201cresource-efficient and environment-friendly, harmonious society\u201d by \nmaintaining a balance between economic growth, socioeconomic development, and environmental protection. The plan sets \nforth a series of environmental targets for urban environmental improvement, ecosystem rehabilitation, natural resources \nmanagement, and mitigating natural disasters. \n \nThe CPS (2008\u20132010) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the PRC emphasizes continued support to reduce poverty, \nimprove the quality of life for the millions of people with low incomes, and assist the PRC in making its contribution to protect \nregional and global public goods. The Project supports ADB\u2019s strategic concerns to improve the environment and promote \nequitable and inclusive growth, as set out in the strategy. Nationally, poor people mostly live in the central and western \nprovinces that lag the eastern provinces in achieving MDGs. In these regions, poverty is mostly rural and strongly correlated \nwith access to land and incidence of land degradation. The Project will address poverty reduction by introducing ecologically- \nsound investments that support the livelihoods of the rural poor by supporting them in obtaining better access to higher-value \nmarket  chains  and  off-farm  income;  improving  vocational  skills;  and  reducing  vulnerability  through  contract  farming \narrangements that include provision of technical, financial, and marketing skills.  \n \nThe poverty partnership agreement, signed by the Government and ADB in September 2003, sets out strategies and \ninterventions for poverty reduction. The PRC and ADB will cooperate on a broad range of activities related to policy and \nregulatory reform and capacity building in the environment sector. They will support projects to reduce poverty as one of the \nunderlying causes of environmental problems. Projects will be designed so that the poor increase their incomes while also \ncapturing environmental benefits. The proposed Project will support the Government\u2019s efforts by tackling the root causes of \npoverty through promoting an integrated water resources management approach that will lead to increased water use \nefficiencies. In this way, it will contribute to achieving MDGs relating to environmental sustainability (MDG7). Specific \ninterventions such as watershed rehabilitation and better allocation of water resources without wastage contribute to this. \nThrough providing a safe and assured water supply for irrigation purposes for the beneficiary communities, the Project will \nhave a direct impact on improving livelihoods in poor farming communities. This will be achieved by directly boosting incomes \nthrough higher crop productivity and increased yields and cropping intensity. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "              Appendix 2  9 \nQinghai is the headwaters for the Yangtze and Yellow rivers. Being mountainous, it has a small population and a large land \narea. The bulk of the 5.38 million population lives in rural areas. Its population includes Tibetan, Mongolian, Hui, Tu, Sala, \nKazak, and other minority nationalities. Qinghai has sustained a high rate of economic growth since 2000. Its gross domestic \nproduct grew by 12.2% annually over 2000\u20132004. As a whole, however, the province is still one of the poorest in the PRC and \ncomprises  a  total  of  15  nationally-designated  poor  counties.  The  per  capita  net  income  and  per  capita  consumption \nexpenditure of farmers in Qinghai in 2004 was about two thirds of the national average.  \n \nThe ratio of income for the bottom 20% households to the provincial average declined from 35.3% to 34.2% in 2004. The \nincidence of rural poverty as measured by poverty line and low-income line was 19.94% and 37.7%, respectively, in 2004. \nApart from income poverty, Qinghai is also very poor as measured by such non-income indicators as education, access to safe \ndrinking water, access to health services, and owned assets. In spite of notable attempts by the Government to reduce poverty, \nQinghai as a whole is unlikely to be able to meet its targets for poverty reduction by 2010. \n \nThe proposed Project is in line with the ADB CPS goals to (i) support environmental improvement, (ii) reverse natural resource \ndegradation, (iii) address water resource depletion and livelihood improvements for people residing in threatened and sensitive \nareas, and (iv) encourage rural development and infrastructure such as irrigation and water management. The proposed \nProject indirectly supports CPS aims by attempting to improve access to agricultural markets for farms and private agro-\nenterprises and providing employment opportunities in disadvantaged and poverty-stricken areas. The three counties were \ndesignated as national poverty counties and in need of immediate attention. This need is clearly indicated in the data for rural \npoverty incidence: 51% in Jianzha, 53% in Hualong, and 61% in Xunhua (using CNY800 per capita per year as a threshold). In \nthe proposed project area (irrigation command area), the poverty incidence is 47%. The poverty incidence in the project area \nby ethnic group is as follows: 40% for the Han, 52% for the Hui, 33% for the Sala, and 35% for the Tibetans. Clearly, poverty is \nwidespread among all groups. Preliminary project interventions, as described in the CPS, will also seek to strengthen provincial \nand county government capacity and empowerment of rural communities through capacity building and training support. \nInterventions  will  simultaneously  help  increase  the  efficiency  of  government  support  services,  including  research  and \nextension.  \n \nThe Project aims at alleviating poverty and improving the livelihoods of poor rural farming households by rehabilitating and \nconstructing key irrigation infrastructure in the three counties of Hualong, Jianza, and Xunhua situated in the northeastern part \nof Qinghai Province. The three project counties have a rural population of 370,000, of which an estimated 154,000 will benefit \nfrom the Project. The ethnic minority population breakdown of the project beneficiaries is as follows: 43% are Sala, 34% are \nHui, 13% are Tibetan, 6% are Han, and 4% are others (mainly Tu). The Project will especially benefit the Sala, a small Muslim \ngroup that are mainly located in Xunhua County; in fact, more than half of all Sala people will be among the beneficiaries. \n \nB.  Targeting Classification  \n         \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the Project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H)  Geographic (TI-G)  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.    Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nThe Project will cover three counties of Qinghai Province and subprojects which will seek to improve irrigated agriculture and \nwater resources management in the project area. The direct benefits to be accrued from this work will be an overall increase in \nagricultural productivity and resulting gains for the farming communities. The farmers will further benefit from reduced wastage \nof water and water logging, improved drainage, and significantly increased irrigation opportunities. Since local labor for the \nconstruction activities will be pooled directly from the project site, there will be a concomitant benefit for poor and vulnerable \ngroups able to take advantage of these additional employment opportunities. \n \nThe Project will also have a direct impact at the household level, as it will afford increased incomes and employment \nopportunities by providing a steady and ensured water supply for irrigation purposes. At present, lack of water is the main \nconstraint farmers face with regard to farming. The Project will directly address this constraint and, in the process, heightened \nincome levels will be noted at the household level.  \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n \n   \n1.   If the Project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \nBasic poverty and social analysis is proposed. The technical assistance (TA) will assess the incidence of poverty using existing \ndata sources, supplemented by a social survey of project beneficiaries. Both income and non-income poverty indexes will be \n ", "10   Appendix 2 \ndetermined. The analysis will be carried out following the guidelines set out in ADB (2007) Handbook on Social Analysis and \nthe Poverty Handbook Analysis and Processes to Support ADB Operations: a working Document 2006. Particular attention will \nbe given to (i) profiling the beneficiaries, including by ethnic and gender disaggregation, as well as by economic and social \ndata, where possible; (ii) determining the incidence of poverty; and (iii) identifying vulnerable groups and any adverse impacts \nassociated with the Project. \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence? \n \nThe PPTA will allocate resources to hire the services of a social and poverty specialist and gender specialist who will assist in \nfurther refining the pro-poor features of the proposed works.  \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross-subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nThe farmers would be targeted by providing them with a cheaper water supply, extension services for cash crops and \nmarketing. The local poor will benefit as laborers, because increased coverage and additional cropping will create additional \nemployment opportunities in the agricultural sector. Opportunities for providing microcredit will be investigated during the TA \nwork. Moreover, there  will  be direct benefits from employment opportunities afforded to local  communities during the \nconstruction works. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \n \nA.   Initial Social Analysis \n \nBased on existing information: \n \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the Project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nProject?  \n \nFrom the outset, the Project will improve agricultural production through integrated irrigated agriculture and water resources \nmanagement. This will directly benefit entire communities engaged in agricultural activities and, in particular, the Hui and Sala \nethnic minority groups. Farmers at all levels in the three counties (large, small, medium, and marginal) will benefit from higher \nagricultural productivity and increased agricultural coverage as a direct result of increased irrigation opportunities. In addition to \ntheir involvement with the construction works, poor men and women will benefit from direct livelihood and employment \nopportunities and skills transfer created as part of the Project and with additional TA funds. The most significant gains will be \nthrough increased employment afforded by opportunities in the agricultural sectors. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed Project?  \n \nAt present, subproject beneficiaries suffer directly from a lack of irrigation opportunities, and cropping intensity is low as the \ncosts of water and electricity associated with farming are unaffordable. Water conservation and command area development \nare basic needs for the communities living in the subproject area and ones that the Project will seek to meet. In overall terms, \nthe poor need employment opportunities, access to capital, and productive skills for livelihood support. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the Project address \nthem?  \n \nAt present, beneficiary communities are unable to finance water management infrastructure. The Project will meet this need \nand will construct the infrastructure necessary for command area development, water conservation, and improved irrigation \nfacilities. The Executing Agency (EA) has limited capacity to manage participatory water conservation and improve irrigation \nfacilities. Similarly, the project beneficiaries have not previously been exposed to community-based participatory methods of \nengagement. Thus, there is a strong need for capacity building in this area. The Project will directly address this gap by \nsupporting inclusiveness and promoting a situation where all beneficiary groups can participate and access benefits from \nproject activities. Linkages between service-providing departments in allied sectors will be sought so that beneficiaries can \naccess resources, training, and capital. Technical assistance will be given to strengthen the EA\u2019s capacity to facilitate and \nmanage participatory processes in integrated irrigated agriculture and water resources management. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "              Appendix 2  11 \nB.   Consultation and Participation \n \n1.   Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n  \nPrimary stakeholders within the Government include the Ministry of Finance, National Development Reform Commission, and \nMinistry of Water Resources. At the provincial level, the EA will be the Qinghai Provincial Department of Water Resources. \nOther key stakeholders include the Provincial National Development and Reform Commission. At the subproject level, \nstakeholders will include farmers and such relevant service-providing agencies as the Department of Environment, and \nAgriculture Extension, which will be responsible for providing extension support services to the subproject beneficiaries. \n \n2.   What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the TA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, and involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations)? \n \nConsultation (e.g., interviews and/or focus groups) and workshops will be the primary methods adopted for social, gender, and \nenvironmental assessments and for developing action plans and methodologies. In addition to the requisite inception, midterm, \nand final workshops, there will be consultations seeking to strengthen participatory subproject development and enhance \nlinkages with associated government line departments to improve support services provision. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \nAn ethnic minority development plan will be prepared and will emphasize participation. \n \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nAn effective, practical, and inclusive participation strategy will be developed based on a thorough assessment of the needs and \ninterests of all the represented groups. Means to strengthen the linkages and cooperation with service-providing agencies and \nthe union council will be pursued to ensure that the benefits from the project interventions are maximized.  \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector and/or subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \n \nEven though women are involved in agricultural activities, their contribution in that area may not be considered important. \nMoreover, women bear the gravest burden of poverty in the project area and are among the most vulnerable in times of \ndisaster. Thus, they need the most support for coping with such events. This is perhaps best demonstrated in instances where \nmale household heads are no longer present and the burden of looking after those households is left with the female heads of \nhouseholds. With limited education and the need to be present at home, they may bear the brunt of poverty\u2019s burdens. \n \n2.    Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?       Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nThe Project presents a unique opportunity to promote women\u2019s empowerment by facilitating their access to employment, skills, \nand other resources. The TA will focus on assessing useful models for integrating gender aspects into the project interventions. \nAs the Project will benefit the agricultural landholders, it will particularly target women as beneficiaries through specific \ncomponents and initiatives. It will also seek to encourage employment and income-earning opportunities in the production \nsector that will benefit the Project. A comprehensive gender action plan, adequately resourced, will be prepared during the TA \nand its findings integrated into the ethnic minority development plan. \n \n3.   Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality?        \n        Yes          No    Please explain. \n \nIncreased farm productivity from improved irrigation and related processing will enable women to contribute a larger share of \nhousehold incomes compared to that from the subsistence farming they do now. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "12   Appendix 2 \n \nIII.
