INTRODUCTION \n1.  Electronic procurement provides opportunities to strengthen procurement efficiency, and \nthus to improve the timely and cost-effective delivery of public services, besides facilitating \npublic access to procurement information. Electronic Government Procurement (e-GP) have \nbeen  proven  to  produce  transparency  and  significant  savings  for  those  countries  that  can \nimplement it successfully. A very effective tool in the fight against corruption, it also promotes \nintegration and stimulates greater productivity not only in government but also in small and \nmedium-sized enterprises.1 The Government of the Philippines is implementing an electronic \nprocurement  system  (EPS)  for  government  entities,  which  it  regards  as  an  important \nanticorruption initiative and a critical part of its governance agenda.2 In December 2000, the \nProcurement Service of the Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM), with technical \nassistance (TA) support from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), made an \nInternet-based pilot EPS operational  throughout government. The EPS implementation has \nreceived active support from the Government through several executive orders and through the \nGovernment Procurement Reform Act (Republic Act 9184), which was passed in January 2003. \nIn 2006, PS-DBM launched phase 1 of the Philippine Government Electronic Procurement \nSystem (PhilGEPS). This release combined the functionality of the pilot EPS and enhancements \ndrawn from the experience in implementing the system. \n2.  In 2007, the Government, committed to moving beyond phase 1, requested TA from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank for the implementation of phases 2\u20135 of \nPhilGEPS.  The  TA  will  enable  the  Government  to  continue  strengthening  PhilGEPS  and \nimplementing it more widely, as the Government and ADB are committed to doing under the \n2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption \nAction  Plan.3   On  4 September  2008,  under  the  Accra  Agenda  for  Action,  ministers  of \ndeveloping countries including the Philippines and heads of development partner agencies \nincluding ADB agreed to accelerate and intensify the implementation of the Paris Declaration. \nThe Philippines was one of 10 countries proposed for the pilot implementation of country \nsystems in procurement by the World Bank. ADB has agreed to actively collaborate in the pilot \nproject. TA preparation was reported in ADB\u2019s Aid Harmonization and Alignment Action Plan4 of \n31 July 2007 and the inclusion of the TA in the 2009\u20132010 country program was approved on \n28 April 2008.5 The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.6 \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  Philippines  used  to  have  more  than  100  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  on \ngovernment  procurement.  In  January  2003  this  fragmented  and  cumbersome  system  was \nreplaced with the Government Procurement Reform Act, which provided for \u201cthe modernization, \nstandardization, and regulation of the procurement activities of the government.\u201d The law was \ndesigned to streamline the Philippine procurement system, reduce opportunities for graft and \n                                                 \n1  Multilateral Development Bank E-Procurement website. http://www.mdb-egp.org/Index.aspx \n2  National Economic and Development Authority. 2004.

Manila. \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 January 2009. \n ", "2   \ncorruption,  harmonize  the  system  with  international  standards  and  practices,  and  promote \ntransparency, competitiveness, streamlined procurement, accountability, and public monitoring. \nThe  PhilGEPS  is  now  managed  by  PS-DBM  under  the  supervision  of  the  Government \nProcurement Policy Board (GPPB), an interagency policy and monitoring body mandated to \nhandle all public procurement matters and to protect the national interest in all such matters. \nThe  GPPB  is  headed  by  the  secretary  of  budget  and  management  as  chair  and  the \ndirector-general of the National Economic and Development Authority as alternate chair. The \nsecretaries of public highways, finance, science and technology, health, trade and industry, \neducation, defense, energy, and interior and local government are members, together with a \nrepresentative  from  the  private  sector  to  be  appointed  by  the  President  upon  the \nrecommendation of GPPB7.  \n4.  The Government Procurement Reform Act requires the use of PhilGEPS by all national \ngovernment agencies, government-owned and controlled corporations, government financial \ninstitutions,  state  universities  and  colleges,  and  local  government  units.  Suppliers, \nmanufacturers, contractors, and consultants must be registered in the system. The use of \nPhilGEPS will improve transparency in government procurement since opportunities to trade \nwith  government  and  the  ensuing  transactions  are  provided  online.  Information  about  the \nwinning bidder, the reason for the award, and the contract amount is currently accessible \nthrough  the  system.  PhilGEPS  gives  suppliers  continuous  access  to  government  bid \nopportunities. Suppliers no longer have to visit government agencies to monitor bid notices. The \nbid-matching feature of the system allows them to be notified automatically by e-mail if newly \nposted government opportunities match their line of business. \n \n5.  Since  PhilGEPS  was  first  implemented  in  2006,  compliance  with  the  publication  of \nprocurement notices has been high, but the requirement to publish contract awards as well has \nstill to be fully complied with. End users also need regular training. Despite having unlimited \naccess to the system, not all government agencies use it.  \n \n6.  A recent review of the pilot use of PhilGEPS for official development assistance projects \nestablished the fact that agencies8 register and post notices more to comply with the implementing \nrules and regulations (IRR) of the Government Procurement Reform Act than to use the system in \ntheir  procurement.  Published  bid  notices  sometimes  provide  insufficient  information  and \ninstructions to prospective suppliers about the items being procured, or insufficient online access \nto the bid documents. Moreover, while the system is designed to provide information about \nprocurement opportunities and contract awards, it does not cover bidding and has no payment \nfacility; both are key functions of phases 2\u20135. Thus, current PhilGEPS functionality falls short of \naddressing the efficiency and economy objectives of public procurement.  \n \n7.   The country procurement assessment9 stressed the need to prepare and issue IRR that \nwill harmonize government procurement bidding documents, and a manual that will specify the \nregulatory framework for procurement under foreign-assisted projects \u2013 IRR-B. GPPB, going a \nstep  further,  is  pursuing  the  adoption  of  \u201cOne  IRR\u201d  to  cover  all  government  procurement, \nincluding that funded by official development assistance. ADB and other development partners \n(World Bank and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation) are actively involved in the \nreview of One IRR.  \n                                                 \n7 Republic Act 9184, Government Procurement Reform Act, Article XX, Section 64 \n8  Department of Public Works and Highways, Department of Education, Department of Health, Department of \nAgriculture,  Foreign-Assisted  and  Special  Projects  Office  of  the  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural \nResources, and Local Water Utilities and Administration. \n9 World Bank 2008. Philippines Country Procurement Assessment Report  \n ", "  3\n \n8.   Delay in the implementation of phase 1 set back the development of phases 2\u20135. The \nGovernment  has  sought  technical  assistance  from  both  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  for  the \nimplementation of phases 2\u20135 as part of ongoing cooperation with development partners. The \nWorld Bank, through approved TA, is taking the lead in technical advice for system design, \ndevelopment, and implementation, and in the design of training-of-trainers programs and the \norganization of study tours for key decision makers. ADB is being asked to provide policy advice \nin systems design, the development of Web-based e-training materials, and user acceptance \ntesting of the software to be developed in phases 2\u20135. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The  TA  will  improve  transparency,  efficiency,  and  accountability  in  government \nprocurement and reduce opportunities for corruption. \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  Government procurement is expected to become  more transparent and efficient as \nPhilGEPS is used by all government agencies in e-procurement. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will support the Government in developing phases 2\u20135 of PhilGEPS\u2014virtual \nstore, charges and fees, e-payment, and e-bidding.  \n \n12.   The virtual store (phase 2) is an enhanced electronic catalogue that will allow online \nordering of common supplies, materials, and equipment from procurement service warehouses \nand regional depots. Together with an e-payment gateway, the virtual store will make it easier \nfor government entities to order and pay for goods. Paperwork will be reduced and transactions \nspeeded up.  \n \n13.   The  charges-and-fees  phase  (phase  3)  will  make  the  system  more  sustainable  by \nintroducing user fees for system use and online purchase of bid documents by interested \nsuppliers.  \n \n14.   E-payment  (phase  4)  will  facilitate  transactions  through  the  transfer  of  funds  from \nprocuring entities to the procurement service when buying common goods, and from suppliers \nto  procuring  entities  when  downloading  bid  documents  attached  to  bid  notices  posted  in \nPhilGEPS; the generation of purchase orders; and the payment of fulfilled contracts resulting \nfrom bids processed through the system.  \n \n15.   Finally, e-bid submission (phase 5) will allow the creation of electronic bid forms and an \nelectronic bid box, online delivery of bids, automatic notification of suppliers upon receipt of bids, \nelectronic bid opening, and online posting of bid results. \n \n16.   For full integration, the systems developed under the TA must be built on the same \ntechnical platform as the systems developed under phase 1. From a technology standpoint, the \nspecific outputs will be the designed, developed, and tested systems, including purchased \ntesting software and hardware (peripherals and office suite software, among others) that will \n ", "4   \nallow access through regional depots of procurement services. To facilitate technology transfer \nand build awareness of the applications, the TA will also support the design and implementation \nof e-training for PhilGEPS users (both suppliers and government procurement staff).  \n \n17.  The  extent  to  which  market  players  will  accept  and  use  the  electronic  government \nprocurement system will depend on fundamental trust in the transparency, impartiality, and \nfairness of public procurement as well as access to Internet-based technology. The TA will \ntherefore support user acceptance testing, specifically load and security testing. It will build on \nthe  existing  mechanism  of  procurement  oversight  with  the  participation  of  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) and civil society organizations to increase awareness of the facilities \ncreated by PhilGEPS and inform stakeholders about the system, and to support the capacity of \nusers  to  operate  and  navigate  the  Web-based  procurement  system.  A  robust  and  secure \nelectronic bidding and electronic payment facility will foster trust in the security of the system, \nwhile ensuring transparency and efficiency in public procurement.  \n \n18.  Parallel funding for PhilGEPS from the World Bank raises the possibility of overlap with \nADB\u2019s systems design and training initiatives. With this in mind, the advisory assistance in \nsystems design for phases 2\u20135 will be provided as follows: technical expertise will come from \nthe World Bank, and policy advice from ADB. Coordination of efforts with the World Bank and \nthe Department of Budget and Management will be crucial for the success of this component. \nThe Government\u2019s continued commitment to the enhancement and further development of \nPhilGEPS  is  assumed.  In  the  matter  of  training,  while  the  World  Bank  is  supporting  the \ntraining-the-trainers  programs,  ADB  will  support  e-training.  ADB  will  fund  the  design  and \nproduction of e-learning materials (either interactive compact discs or online web tutorials) to \nsustain the training effort. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which $600,000 will be financed with a grant \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  (TASF-Others).  The  Government  will  finance  in  kind  the \nlocal-currency cost of $200,000 by providing office accommodation, transport, and counterpart \nstaff. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The GPPB Technical Support Office will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and the \nPhilGEPS Office of PS-DBM will be the Implementing Agency. For seamless and integrated \nprovision of inputs from ADB and the World Bank, the PhilGEPS Office of PS-DBM will take the \nlead  in  TA  implementation  under  the  supervision  of  the  GPPB  Technical  Support  Office. \nCoordination meetings are planned every 2 months. \n \n21.  The TA will require the services of an (individual) international expert in electronic public \nprocurement systems and a training provider with experience in the design and implementation \nof e-training initiatives. Ideally, the e-training materials will be designed and implemented by the \nsame consulting team that is training the trainers (with funding from the World Bank through a \ngrant  from  its  Institutional  Development  Fund).  To  ensure  compatibility  with  the  PhilGEPS \nplatform that is already operational, as well as consistency of training approach, consultants \npreviously hired under CIDA and World Bank assistance will not be excluded from consideration. \nADB, in coordination with the Government, will hire consultants according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of reference for \n ", "  5\nthe consulting services are in Appendix 3. The progress made during the TA will be assessed \nindependently by NGOs involved in procurement oversight. Information technology equipment \nand testing software will be procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). The TA will be implemented over 30 months, from February 2009 \nto July 2011. \n \n22.  The  plan  for  disseminating  the  expected  outputs  of  the  TA  includes  uploading \npublications onto the PhilGEPS website and making presentations to broader consulting and \ncontractors\u2019 communities. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  Philippines  for  Strengthening  the  Philippine  Government  Electronic \nProcurement System, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nSummary  and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact       \n     \nImproved transparency  All high-value  PhilGEPS reports \nand efficiency in  government   \ngovernment  procurement is   \nprocurement   advertised    \n \nAll contract awards are  Government procurement \npublished within  statistics \n3 months of bid award   \nOutcome       \n       \nPhilGEPS is used by all  All cities are registered  PhilGEPS reports  Commitment and willingness \ngovernment agencies in  by the end of 2009    of participating agencies and \ne-procurement    suppliers \nAll provinces are \n \nregistered by the end of  Government procurement \n  Awareness and informed \n2009  statistics   \nparticipation of civil society \nNumber of registered  organizations and NGOs in \nsuppliers, contractors,  public procurement \nand consultants   \nincreases (from 26,057    \nin September 2007 to \n34,000 by September \n2009) \nOutputs       \n       \n1.
