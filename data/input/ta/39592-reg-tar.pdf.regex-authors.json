INTRODUCTION \n1.  Many countries in East and South Asia are intensifying efforts at regional economic \ncooperation and integration.1 A number of initiatives for economic cooperation within the region \nhave either come into force in recent years or are in various stages of negotiation.2  Most of the \ncooperation agreements are among countries within the subregions of East Asia and South \nAsia.3 However, linkages between the two subregions are growing, with the rising importance of \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  India  in  the  world  economy,  and  against  the \nbackdrop of India\u2019s \u201cLook East\u201d policy initiated in 1991. \n \n2.  An  example  of  agreements  between  East  and  South  Asian  countries  is  the \nComprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement between India and Singapore, which came \ninto effect in 2005. India has also signed framework agreements on comprehensive economic \ncooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and a free trade area \nwith Thailand, both of which are under negotiation. The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-\nSectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC)4 is also negotiating its framework \nagreement on a free trade area. PRC-India and PRC-Pakistan free trade agreements have \nbeen proposed and framework agreements are under negotiation. The Bangkok Agreement is \nanother preferential trading agreement among Bangladesh, PRC, India, Korea, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR), and Sri Lanka. In addition to cooperation agreements among \nthemselves, East and South Asian countries are also pursuing similar relationships with other \ncountries in Asia and Pacific region and in other regions. \n \n3.  The proliferation of bilateral agreements to enhance economic cooperation within the \nregion raises questions about the magnitude and distribution\u2014across countries and sectors\u2014of \nthe potential benefits of closer regional economic cooperation, its costs and constraints, and \ndesirable  policies  to  maximize  net  benefits.  Numerous  studies  have  been  undertaken  on \ncooperation within subregions, especially in East Asia. However, research on the implications of \neconomic cooperation between subregions within Asia is relatively scarce. Such research is \nnecessary to inform policymakers about the types and sequence of policies to garner support \nfor, and gain from, regional economic cooperation. This technical assistance (TA) is intended to \ncontribute  to  this  effort  and  complements  other  analytical  work  in  the  area  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).5  The TA framework is in Appendix 1.6 \n                                                 \n1  For the purposes of this technical assistance (TA), East Asia is defined as the 10 members of the Association of \nSoutheast Nations (ASEAN) plus People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Japan, and Republic of Korea (Korea). South \nAsia  is  defined  as  seven  members  of  the  South  Asian  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC): \nBangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. \n2  In this paper, regional economic cooperation refers to policy measures jointly undertaken by a group of countries \ntypically located within a geographic area to facilitate or enhance economic integration. Regional integration refers \nto actual integration of economies, which may be market-led, without formal cooperative initiatives (e.g., within East \nAsia until recently). The focus of this technical assistance is on cooperation among East and South Asian countries \nin trade of goods and services, and in infrastructure and trade facilitation. \n3  Within East Asia, some agreements in force are (i) ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), (ii) ASEAN-PRC Framework \nAgreement,  (iii)  Japan-Singapore  Economic  Agreement,  (iv)  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Economic \nCooperation,  and  (v)  BIMP-EAGA  (Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines-East  ASEAN  Growth  Area).  Within \nSouth Asia, agreements that are in force are (i) South Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA), and (iii) South Asia \nSubregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC),  as  well  as  bilateral  agreements  between  the  largest \neconomy\u2500India\u2500and Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. \n4  BIMSTEC comprises Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. \n5  ADB. 2001.

Over the past decade, East Asia (excluding Japan) and South Asia were two of the \nfastest growing subregions in the world with annual average growth rates of 6.9% and 5.8% \nrespectively. In 2004, the two subregions, excluding Japan, accounted for 10%7 of total world \noutput, compared with 23% for the Eurozone and 32.6% for countries in the North American \nFree Trade Agreement (NAFTA).8 In spite of the rapid growth, however, economic integration \nbetween the two subregions has increased only modestly. For example, East Asia\u2019s share in \nSouth Asia\u2019s total trade decreased slightly to 20.2% in 2004 from 20.8% in 1994, although it \nincreased from a low of 17.8% in 2000 as East Asian countries recovered from the 1997 \nfinancial crisis. South Asia\u2019s share in East Asia\u2019s total trade rose only modestly to 1.6% in 2004 \nfrom 1.3% in 1994.9 The scope for enhanced investment links between the two subregions also \nappears to be large. East Asia\u2019s share of total foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows into South \nAsia has risen from 6.5% in 1990, but it remained relatively low at 12% in 2002.10 South Asia\u2019s \nFDI  into  East  Asia  has  remained  negligible  during  the  same  period,  although  anecdotal \nevidence suggests that Indian companies\u2019 investment in PRC is gradually increasing.11 The \npotential  for  sustaining  high  rates  of  growth  in  the  two  subregions  through  enhanced \ncooperation  and  integration  is  thus  large.  Much  of  the  integration  that  has  occurred  until \nrecently\u2014especially within East Asia\u2014reflected unilateral reforms and multilateral liberalization \nwithin the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework.12 The spate of cooperation agreements \nin recent years suggests that countries perceive significant advantages to be gained from \nregional cooperation.  \n \n5.  There are several potential benefits of closer economic cooperation between the two \nsubregions.13 First, when cooperation leads to greater integration, the consequent expansion of \nthe market for goods and services increases the scope for economies of scale and greater \ncompetition. Second, increased competition within the integrated region could lead producers \noutside the region to reduce their prices as well, lowering prices of imports to the region and \nimproving its terms of trade. Third, a more integrated region could attract more FDI with its \nattendant benefits of technology and knowledge transfer, and higher productivity. Fourth, and \nperhaps  more  importantly,  regional  cooperation  agreements  enable  deeper  and  wider \nintegration among member countries than what may be feasible within a multilateral framework. \nCooperation on infrastructure and trade facilitation (e.g., transport, customs clearance, and \nproduct standards) and services (e.g., financial services and labor services) would likely lead to \n                                                                                                                                                             \n6  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 27 September 2005. \n7  Including Japan, the share was 21.4%.

Bhutan, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam have \nobserver status. \n13 Several potentially important noneconomic benefits of cooperation and integration are not addressed directly in this \nTA, such as (i) enhanced political solidarity and security among member countries, (ii) greater bargaining power of \nmember countries in international forums, and (iii) possibility that cooperation agreements may serve as a \ncommitment mechanism and help lock in reforms in member countries.

", "  3\nreduction in trade costs and result in welfare gains well in excess of gains from mere tariff \nliberalization.14 \n \n6.  In order to achieve their aim of boosting productivity and growth, however, East and \nSouth Asian economies have to overcome a number of challenges. First, the potential for trade \ndiversion and trade deflection has to be minimized.15 Preferential tariffs granted to member \ncountries may lead to diversion of trade if imports are sourced from a regional supplier that may \nbe less efficient than one outside the region. Differential tariffs against extra-regional imports by \nmembers could also lead to trade deflection as exporters outside the region attempt to enter the \nregional market through the member with the lowest external tariff. These problems are likely to \nbe magnified with overlapping agreements where a country is party to more than one bilateral \nagreement, sometimes among the same group of countries.16 Both risks could be minimized by \nlimiting the margin of preference to members versus nonmembers. Furthermore, rules of origin \nspecified on extra-regional imports to minimize trade deflection should be nonrestrictive so that \n(i) they do not heighten uncertainty for trade and investment, and (ii) their administrative costs \nare manageable. Second, in some member countries, tariff revenues are a significant portion of \nfiscal revenues. The loss of tariff revenues from trade diversion may need to be accompanied \nby fiscal reforms. Third, integration may lead to changes in the pattern of production across \ncountries and sectors. These changes could arise from differences in comparative advantage \nand  from  location-specific  clustering  effects.17  As  a  consequence,  benefits  from  regional \nintegration may not be equitably distributed across countries and sectors.    \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The intended impact of the TA is to facilitate more effective economic cooperation and \nintegration  between  developing  member  countries  in  East  and  South  Asia.  The  expected \noutcome of the TA is that public and private stakeholders have an in-depth understanding and \nappreciation of policy steps required for effective economic cooperation and integration between \nthe two subregions. The TA would thus help developing member countries and ADB devise \nstrategies for effective regional economic cooperation and integration, and support ADB\u2019s role \nas a catalyst of regional cooperation.   \n \n8.  The outcome will be supported by a set of outputs:  (i) an assessment of sectors with the \npotential for significant benefits from cooperation; (ii) specific policy options at the regional, \n                                                 \n14 BIMSTEC and ASEAN-India Framework Agreements include these provisions. Preferential trade in services is \nmore likely to generate welfare gains than in merchandise trade because barriers to services trade (e.g., ownership \nrestrictions on foreign investment) are often prohibitive and do not generate government revenues (see Mattoo, \nAaditya and Carsten Fink. 2002. Regional Agreements and Trade in Services: Policy Issues (World Bank Policy \nResearch Working Paper 2852); Brooks, David Roland-Holst, and Fan Zhai. 2005. Asia\u2019s Long-Term Growth and \nIntegration: Reaching Beyond Trade Policy Barriers (Economics and Research Department Policy Brief No.38). \nManila: ADB. The latter publication presents results showing that the potential benefits to East and South Asian \ncountries of removing structural barriers to trade\u2014in terms of real income, exports, and terms of trade\u2014are much \nlarger than those from tariff reform. \n15 This may be particularly pertinent for South Asian economies where imports attract generally higher tariff rates. The \naverage tariff rate among South Asian countries was 15.3%, compared with 7% in East Asia, including Japan, and \n8.5%, excluding Japan. Data for 2001 and 2002 as available in World Bank. 2004. World Development Indicators \nWashington D.C.: World Bank. \n16 For example, India, Myanmar, and Thailand are signatories to both BIMSTEC and ASEAN-India agreements. \n17 Firms within an industry may cluster in particular locations to benefit from (i) proximity to consumers and suppliers, \n(ii) availability of specialized labor or other inputs, and (iii) technological or knowledge spillovers from other \ncompanies located in the area. \n ", "4   \nsubregional, and country levels to realize those benefits; and (iii) dissemination of the findings to \npublic and private stakeholders through a senior policy seminar, publication of the final TA \nreport, and media outreach. A draft outline of the final report is in Appendix 2. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  A study will be undertaken using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to \nestimate the potential benefits of enhanced integration between East and South Asia and the \ndistribution of these benefits across countries and sectors.18 The CGE model will allow the \nestimation  of  the  potential  effects  of  trade  liberalization  among  members  under  various \nscenarios and point to policy options that could enhance integration. Although the results are \nsensitive to assumptions about key parameters incorporated in the model, it is a widely used \ntool in assessing the economic impact of different policies. \n \n10.  Three separate studies will discuss the current degree of integration among East and \nSouth  Asian  countries  in  each  of  the  three  areas:  (i)  merchandise  trade  and  investment, \n(ii) trade in services, and (iii) infrastructure and trade facilitation. They will assess the scope for \ncooperation and further integration in specific sectors within each area; and provide policy \noptions  at  regional,  subregional,  and  country  levels.  The  analysis  will  incorporate  an \nassessment of current and proposed regional agreements in East and South Asia in these \nareas, as well as their compatibility with the WTO framework. Where relevant, the analyses will \ndraw upon lessons from experience of regional cooperation in other regions. \n \n11.  In addition, six case studies will be prepared to provide further detail on all three areas of \ncooperation from the perspective of selected developing member countries or country groups. \nThe case studies could include three economies each in East and South Asia, one of which may \nbe a country grouping such as the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). These studies will help \nidentify constraints that may be faced by a developing member country, such as the fiscal \nimpact from liberalization and/or the magnitude of adjustment required with the likely change in \nthe pattern of production from greater integration. The case studies would thus be able to \nindicate feasible policy options to overcome constraints and smooth the transition to greater \nintegration. The studies would also address, from the country\u2019s perspective, the consistency of \nvarious existing or proposed regional agreements as well as their compatibility with the WTO \nframework. \n \n12.  The following key activities are planned for the TA: \n \n(i)  Select consultants to research topics and prepare reports. A principal (international) \nconsultant will be selected from among those chosen for the four topical studies (on \npotential benefits and three areas) to coordinate the work of other consultants and \nconsolidate the overall findings of the studies. \n(ii) Organize a TA inception workshop to (a) detail the scope of research for each of the \nfirst four studies on potential benefits and the three areas; (b) identify the scope of \ncountry  case  studies;  (c)  finalize  the  terms  of  reference  for  each  study,  and \n(d) develop a timetable for completion of the studies on potential benefits, and on the \nfour topics, country case studies, and the final TA report. \n                                                 \n18 This TA will build on the results of ADB. 2004.

In estimating \npotential benefits, it will employ the CGE model developed under TA 6205\u2013REG, as appropriate. \n ", "  5\n(iii) Organize a finalization workshop once all the draft studies and the final TA report are \ncompleted. This workshop will involve the participation of policymakers as well as \nprivate sector representatives in East and South Asia to discuss key findings of the \nresearch and recommend any revisions to be made to the draft reports. Based on \nthe discussion at the workshop, the consultants for each study will revise the draft \nreports and the principal consultant will submit a final TA report to ADB. The final TA \nreport will include a set of specific policy options to enhance economic cooperation \nand integration in East and South Asia. It will identify the measures that can be taken \nat regional, subregional, and country levels, at various intervals, to promote greater \neconomic cooperation and integration among East and South Asian countries. \n(iv) The results from the final TA report will be presented at a senior policy seminar with \nhigh-level  officials  from  East  and  South  Asia,  and,  where  appropriate,  at  other \nmeetings.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 and will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Within ADB, the Office of Regional \nEconomic Integration (OREI) will implement the TA in close collaboration with other concerned \ndepartments and offices. OREI staff will (i) facilitate the engagement of consultants required to \nconduct the studies, (ii) review the research output and its consistency with the consultants\u2019 \nterms of reference, (iii) plan and coordinate two workshops and the senior policy seminar \nrelated to the TA, and (iv) help produce and disseminate the results of the TA.   \n \n15.  The TA will require about 9 person-months of international consulting services provided \nby individual consultants: (i) 1 person-month each for the principal consultant, the study on \nservices trade, and the case study on a group of countries (e.g., GMS); and (ii) 2 person-months \neach for the studies on potential benefits, merchandise trade, and infrastructure and trade \nfacilitation. The TA will require 5 person-months of domestic consulting services provided by \nindividual consultants for the country case studies. All the consultants will be engaged by ADB \nin  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The outline terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n16.  The TA is expected to commence in January 2006 and be completed by June 2007.  \nThe inception workshop is planned tentatively for the first quarter of 2006, and a finalization \nworkshop for the fourth quarter of 2006. A senior policy seminar is planned for the second \nquarter  of  2007.  The  inception  workshop  and  senior  policy  seminar  will  be  held  at  ADB \nHeadquarters. The finalization workshop is planned to be held in Singapore. The TA report will \nbe published as a book to be disseminated to relevant policymakers and members of the public. \n \nIV.
