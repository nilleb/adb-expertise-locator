The Government of the Maldives has requested the assistance of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to develop a new national development plan (the 7th NDP; the Plan) for the period \n2006\u20132010, and provided ADB with the terms of reference for such assistance. The concept of this \nassistance was supported for funding by the Cooperation Fund in Support of the Formulation and \nImplementation of National Poverty Reduction Strategies (NPRS) at a peer review meeting on 13 \nMarch  2005.  A  Fact-Finding  Mission  (4\u201311  April  2005)  reached  understandings  with  the \nGovernment on the long-term goal and objectives of the technical assistance (TA); its scope; \nimplementation arrangements; cost and financing arrangements; and the terms of reference for the \nconsultants.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  has  expressed  interest  to \nprovide support for the TA through the services of experts employed by UNDP and acceptable to \nADB. The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 16 February 2005.  \nThe TA framework is shown in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Until the end of 2004, the Maldives experienced favorable economic development and \ngrowth. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth accelerated to 8.5% in 2003, lifting nominal per \ncapita GDP to about $2,509 in that year, the highest in the South Asian region. Growth was led by \ntourism, which expanded by over 15% in 2003 and accounted for about 33% of GDP. The fisheries \nsector, which accounts for about 6% of GDP, is estimated to have grown by about 3% in 2004. \nHowever, poverty and vulnerability, which are mostly related to remoteness and lack of access to \npublic services, remain a serious issue. Maldives remains eligible for concessional assistance from \nADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund because, notwithstanding its high per capita income, it faces high \npoverty and vulnerability. \n \n3.  In a clear manifestation of its vulnerability, the tsunami of December 2004 will have a major \nimpact on the Maldivian economy, much of which will become manifest over the first 6\u201312 months \nafter the event. The joint needs assessment done by the Government, ADB, United Nations (UN), \nand  the  World  Bank  reports  that  the  most  likely  effects  in  2005  will  be  a  severe  economic \nslowdown with low real GDP growth of about 1% of GDP, a doubling of the current account deficit, \nand a significant widening of the fiscal deficit. While it is expected that tourism and fisheries \nactivities will likely recover to pre-tsunami capacity toward the latter part of 2005, identifying a more \nexpanded role for these sectors in the development of a pro-poor economic growth plan for the \nMaldives remains a challenge.  \n4.  The long-term vision for the development of the Maldives is presented in \u201cVision 2020.\u201d The \n6th National Development Plan (6th NDP; 2001\u20132005) was designed as a policy- and strategy-\noriented blueprint to steer the development of the first 5 years of Vision 2020 to: \n(i)  Diversify and expand the economy by further developing existing industries and by \nexploring new economic activities, while ensuring the sustainability of physical and \nnatural resources; \n(ii)  Increase  the  role  of  private  sector  in  the  development  process,  particularly  in \nexpanding the economic base of the country; \n(iii)  Improve the quality and relevance of educational, health, and social services, while \nensuring  that  the  benefits  of  development  are  shared  equitably  among  the \npopulation; \n(iv)  Increase the human resource capacity and productivity by providing relevant training \nand employment opportunities; \n(v)  Pursue legislative, regulatory, governance, and administrative reform to facilitate \nrapid economic and social development; \n ", "2   \n(vi)  Develop  a  sustainable  and  cost-effective  transportation  and  telecommunications \ninfrastructure to facilitate economic, social, and regional development; and \n(vii)  Ensure sociopolitical stability and democratic participation of all in the development \nprocess, while upholding national unity and social cohesiveness based on shared \nsocial, cultural, and religious values. \n \n5.  The 6th NDP had a collection of appropriate policy statements; however, they were often not \naccompanied  by  realistic  action  plans  for  their  implementation.  Various  stakeholders,  when \nconsulted, identified some of the weaknesses of the 6th NDP as: \n \n(i)  The absence of a monitorable framework that could guide the implementation and \nshow at each stage the progress achieved.  \n(ii)  Lack  of  realistic  strategies  to  implement  the  identified  policies,  and  lack  of \ncoordination between various strategies of individual ministries. \n(iii)  The  6th  Plan  was  not  costed  and  did  not  accompany  a  realistic  medium-term \nexpenditure framework (MTEF) and a prioritized public investment plan to support it.  \n(iv)  Pro-poor  policies  such  as  affordable  housing,  sanitation,  and  water  supply \nmanagement;  employment-generating  economic  growth  activities;  and  skills \ndevelopment were not adequately emphasized. \n \n6.  Recognizing these issues, the Government intends to prepare the 7th NDP as a results-\nbased plan directed to contribute to the achievement of the long-term goals of Vision 2020. The \ngoals  of  the  7th  NDP  are:  (i)  reduction  of vulnerability  and  poverty;  (ii)  improving  access  to \nopportunities and services through regional development; (iii) achieving sustainable and equitable \neconomic and social development through greater participation of all sectors of the society; and \n(iv) strengthening family values and national unity through investing in social, cultural, and religious \nharmony. It is the intention of the Government to ensure that medium- and long-term priorities are \nclearly defined through a prioritized action plan that includes the sequencing and resourcing of the \nneeded actions; that important crosscutting issues such as gender equity drive the design of the \nplan; and that the plan is informed by the Government\u2019s Strategic Economic Plan, the Sectoral \nMaster Plans, and the National Recovery and Reconstruction Plan. In this sense, the 7th NDP will \nform the Government\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. As in any results-oriented plan, the \nGovernment intends to monitor progress made in the implementation of this plan, and report to all \nstakeholders such progress made through a medium-term progress report and a final assessment \nreport. \n \n7.  Two sets of factors will affect the Government\u2019s strategy to develop the economy in the \nperiod covered by the 7th NDP. First, the vulnerability of the country to tsunami and the impact of \nremoteness  on  increasing  poverty  has  necessitated  that  the  Government\u2019s  Population  and \nDevelopment Consolidation Strategy be an important contributor to the future development plans \nof  the  Maldives.  Second,  the  country\u2019s  graduation  from  least-developed  country  status \nnecessitates that a transition strategy for the country be developed.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  impact  sought  by  the  technical  assistance  is  to  contribute  effectively  to  the \nachievement of the goals of the 7th NDP as described in para. 6. The outcome of the TA would be \na results-based 7th NDP focused on achieving the goals identified in para. 6. The indicators for \nevaluating  ADB\u2019s  success  in  developing  sustainable  capacity  in  the  Government  to  plan, \nimplement, and monitor results-based national poverty reduction plan are two: first, the mid-term \n ", "  3\nand final reports on implementation as mentioned in para. 6; second, if, at the completion of the \nTA, the Government is in a position to draft an action plan that \n \n(i)  identifies and ranks actions to be taken during the period covered by the 7th NDP; \n(ii)  aligns external funding resources with the priorities of the 7th NDP; and \n(iii)  sets  priorities  for  the  medium-term  budgetary  framework  in  such  a  way  that  it \nsupports the areas of priority in the 7th NDP. \n \n9.  The outputs of the TA are: \n \n(i)  Background study of (a) work done on a medium-term macroeconomic framework; \n(b) the  existing  processes  used  by  the  Government  to  prepare  an  MTEF  with \ncoherent  prioritization  of  development  aid  projects  supported  by  appropriate \nbudgetary allocations (this study will be done in close coordination with the World \nBank, which is currently assisting the Government with a TA project focused on \nfacilitating the development of an MTEF, improving the process of appraisal and \nselection of capital investment projects, and enhancing expenditure prioritization); \n(c) assessment of existing monitoring and evaluation systems in the public sector, \nincluding proposals on how to address existing gaps if found; and (d) progress \nmade and achievements under the 6th NDP. This output will not require reports, only \nto inform the work on the 7th NDP. \n(ii)  In collaboration with the core ministries, production of medium-term sectoral road \nmaps  (accompanied  by  realistic  goals  and  targets,  as  well  as  indicators  of \nmonitoring progress toward expected sectoral outcomes) for the development of the \ncore sectors. All other ministries will be involved in the process so that these road \nmaps will serve as good practice models for the preparation of other sectoral road \nmaps by the other ministries. \n(iii)  Provision  of  advice,  needed  background  reports  and  technical  support  to  the \nGovernment on preparing a results-based national development plan and assisting \nthe  Government  in  synthesizing  the  various  inputs  received  from  consultants, \nstakeholders, and other sources into a coherent national plan. \n(iv)  Conducting regional, in-country workshops that would enable ADB, UNDP and the \nGovernment  to  communicate  with  the  country  stakeholders  (various  ministries, \nprivate sector businesses, nongovernment organizations, and other stakeholders) \nthe objectives and the goal of the process of preparation of the 7th NDP and receive \ninput  for  its  design.  Provide  separate  workshops  to  communicate  with  the  line \nministries the findings of the gender assessment and the MTEF. \n(v)  Initiating gender-sensitive and gender-responsive approaches in all sectors and all \nstages of planning, implementation and monitoring. \n(vi)  Mainstreaming key crosscutting issues in the context of mainstreaming Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) in the 7th NDP. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The activities undertaken under the TA are  designed with the objective of knowledge \ntransfer in mind. Therefore, the outputs of the TA will require a series of short discussion notes in \nwhich issues are brought up and views of relevant stakeholders on best approaches to address the \nissues are sought. Person-to-person or small group discussions will be given preference over an \nimpersonal report-producing approach, although the latter is not altogether abandoned as there is \na need to leave behind a record of understandings reached. The final report of the consultants \n(Appendix 4) is the only formal report to ADB and UNDP. \n \n ", "4   \n11.  The TA component on study of existing MTEF processes will assist the Government to \nensure that the 7th NDP is costed, prioritized, and accompanied by a supportive MTEF. This \ncomponent will link the assistance received so far from the UN agencies, the World Bank, and the \nInternational Monetary Fund  to the needed requirements for the costing and prioritization of the \n7th NDP and will identify any gaps. This will prompt the Government to seek further assistance \nfrom various development partners to address these gaps. \n \n12.  The component on study of the macroeconomic framework will study existing processes \nand assistance received from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for building the \nmedium-term macroeconomic framework within the 7th NDP.  \n \n13.  The components on assessment of existing monitoring and evaluation systems and the 6th \nNDP,  and  the  assistance  for  producing  sectoral  roadmaps  will  be  done  with  substantial \ninvolvement of and work done by the staff of ADB and UNDP. These are considered to be areas of \nfocus in ADB\u2019s overall agenda to build capacity both at the DMC level and at the corporate level, \non managing for development results. Therefore, this opportunity will be used to accomplish this \ncapacity building at both levels and ensure better transfer of knowledge to the country. \n \n14.  UNDP will not only assist in all activities mentioned above by means of providing the \nservices of local consultants acceptable to ADB as needed, but will also undertake its separate \nbackground studies and advice to the Government in order to assist in initiating gender-sensitive \nand gender-responsive approaches in all sectors and all stages of planning, implementation, and \nmonitoring and in mainstreaming key cross-cutting issues. \n \n15.  Furthermore, and also with the aim of better transfer of knowledge, the staff of ADB and the \nUN agencies will participate in making presentations at the consultation workshops and will remain \nengaged in consultations with the Government counterparts to help synthesize the information and \ninputs received toward the production of the 7th NDP itself. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $557,000 equivalent, of which $395,000 is in foreign \nexchange and $162,000 equivalent is in local currency. Of the total cost of the TA, the equivalent \nof $377,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for NPRS and administered \nby ADB. As part of its support to the Government for the preparation of the 7th NDP, UNDP will \nprovide, on a parallel basis, the equivalent of $100,000 in services of local consultants acceptable \nto ADB to assist in the implementation of the TA, and in conduct of other activities focused on \ninitiating  gender-sensitive  and  gender-responsive  approaches  in  all  sectors  and  all  stages  of \nplanning,  implementation  and  monitoring  and  on  mainstreaming  key  crosscutting  issues.  The \nGovernment will provide the equivalent of $80,000 in covering the costs of office accommodation, \ntransport, and counterpart staff, as well as other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and the \nfinancing program are presented in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA was advertised in ADB Business Opportunities for a 3-month period. The start of \nTA  processing  (fact-finding)  was  delayed  by  several  months  because  of  the  tsunami-related \nemergency activities in the Maldives. However, the final outputs of the project cannot be delayed \nbeyond end-2005, as the Government is anxious to have a coherent, medium-term plan in place to \nrule the selection of post-tsunami emergency projects in 2006. Therefore, the TA outputs are \nexpected to be produced in a shorter than originally planned period.  \n \n ", "  5\n18.  Given the need for rapid mobilization of the consulting firm, recruitment through direct \nselection is proposed. The particular firm identified for direct selection is appropriately positioned to \nundertake  this  assignment  as  it  has  been  actively  involved  with  results-based  development \nplanning in many small-island economies; it has worked on 43 projects supported by various \nmultilateral development banks and bilateral development partners in 13 small-island economies. \nIn  the  Maldives,  the  firm  has  experience  with  the  environmental  assessment  and  analytical \noverview  of  the  main  natural  resource  base  (fisheries  and  tourism)  and  preparation  of  an \nenvironmental management plan in the Southern Atolls (project supported by the International \nFund for Agricultural Development).1 This experience has prepared the selected firm to maintain an \noverview of the possible impact of the Government\u2019s Population and Development Consolidation \nStrategy and the 7th NDP on the fisheries and tourism activities. The outline terms of reference for \nthe international consulting team are shown in Appendix 3. \n \n19.  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury.  The \nimplementing agency will be the Development Planning Section of the Ministry of Planning and \nNational Development (MPND). The focal point within the implementing agency will be the Director, \nDevelopment Planning. The MPND will establish a number of committees, each comprising line \nministries with close mandates, to assume responsibility in the preparation of the 7th NDP. The \nDepartment of External Resources within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will assume responsibility \nfor  development  partner  coordination,  communications  with  development  partners,  and  for \ninvolvement of the development partners in the process of preparation of the 7th NDP. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 6 months ending in December 2005. The \nconsultants will be assisted by local experts who will be employed by UNDP. The TA will require \nthe services of 4 international consultants recruited from a firm for a total of 15 person-months. \nThese consultants (whose detailed terms of reference are given in Appendix 3) will include: (i) a \npublic finance management specialist with expertise in the budgetary aspects of results-based \nnational development planning for 4 person-months; (ii) 2 results management specialist (one with \nemphasis  on  evaluation  and  monitoring,  the  other  on  results-based  national  and  sectoral \ndevelopment  planning)  for  a  total  of  8  person-months;  and  (iii)  an  economist  specializing  in \nparticipatory development aid planning for 3 person-months. The economist will act as the team \nleader to coordinate the activities of the other international consultants, guide the work of local \nexperts, and advise the Government as needed. \n \n21.  Activities of the TA will begin with an inception meeting, participated by the ADB, UNDP, \nthe  Government,  and  the  consultants,  to  review  and  agree  on  the  goals,  objectives,  guiding \nprinciples, outputs, and activities of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $377,000 to the Government of \nthe  Maldives  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Cooperation  Fund  in  Support  of  the \nFormulation and Implementation of National Poverty Reduction Strategies (NPRS) for Developing \na Results-Oriented 7th National Development Plan, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n1 The proposed firm is PDP Australia Pty Ltd. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and   \nIndicators  Reporting  Assumptions and \nMechanisms  Risks \n       \nImpact      Risk \nTo contribute effectively to the achievement of  \u2022  Reduced income poverty.
