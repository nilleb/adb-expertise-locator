INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) aims to support the conduct of \nimpact evaluation (IE) studies on the use of financial technology in developing member countries \n(DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 This is in line with ADB\u2019s overall support for \nevidence-based policy development. Based on the findings of the IE studies, lessons will be \ndrawn to inform ADB operation teams and DMC officers in designing future ADB-financed projects. \nFinancial technology can potentially enhance the conduct of business, limit person-to-person \ncontact, and sustain business operations during pandemics and disasters. In the face of the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, financial technology has helped to enable financial \ntransactions and goods deliveries when personal mobility has been restricted. \n \n2.  The  TA  supports  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  guiding  principle  of  promoting  innovative \ntechnology. In particular, it aligns with operational priority 1 (addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities) and operational priority 2 (accelerating progress in gender equality).2 The \nTA is not part of the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD) annual \nwork program for 2020.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  In response to COVID-19, governments across Asia have undertaken lockdown measures \nthat have restricted economic activity and adversely affected the cash flows of businesses and \nhouseholds. As social distancing has taken hold worldwide, there has been tremendous growth \nin the use of financial technology.4 Recent advances in financial technology provide opportunities \nfor ADB and DMCs to improve the effectiveness of projects to respond to the challenges of a \npandemic. However, the use of advanced financial technology in public projects remains novel, \nand evidence of its effectiveness under COVID-19-related lockdowns and movement restrictions \nremains thin. Meanwhile, financial technology continues to advance, leaving many technologies \nuntested for public sector application. \n \n4.  In parallel, financial technology is becoming accessible to users at a low cost. More big \ndata  on  financial  transactions  are  increasingly  available  through  automated  processes. \nAdministrative and billing information is increasingly accumulated wherein such data could be \nlinked with other databases to broaden credit access.5 Financial information could also be linked \nwith assets through the internet of things (IoT) to track loan servicing.6 Digital identification \nsystems give governments and businesses the ability to deliver services electronically, boosting \nefficiency and driving innovation. E-payment systems, for instance, could ease tax payments and \n \n1  Financial technology refers to internet-based and other digital technology that supports or enables banking and \nfinancial services. Examples relevant to ADB operations include digitized national identity records used for providing \npublic services, digital credit tracking, blockchain-based payment systems, credit services using the internet of things \n(IoT), and mobile phone- or internet-based financial transactions. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 October 2020. \n4  S. Whitelaw et al. 2020. Applications of Digital Technology in COVID-19 Pandemic Planning and Response. Lancet \nDigital Health. 2 (8): E435\u2013E440. \n5  For example, by using advanced analytics platforms and artificial intelligence to assess transactional and alternative \ndata (something as simple as a bank statement that shows the cash flow of a small and medium-sized enterprise), \nfinancial technology lenders are gaining a much deeper understanding of small and medium-sized enterprises. They \ncan establish businesses' creditworthiness, evaluate risk more easily, and release loans in as few as 1\u20132 days. \n6  An example is IoT-based auto loans in the Philippines, provided by Aeon Credit Service (Philippines) and a financial \ntechnology startup called Global Mobility Service. Defaults on loan payments result in deactivation of vehicles, after \nmultiple warnings and when vehicles are safely parked. \n ", "2 \nadministration, improving tax compliance and revenue. Digital identification systems connect \nisolated and unreached populations to government subsidies, electoral participation, financial \nservices,  educational  and  job  opportunities,  and  health  care.  Through  the  use  of  digital \nidentification systems, social protection programs could be linked with identity and banking \ninformation of recipients to enable delivery of these programs.7 At the same time, however, there \nis an urgent need to identify risks and vulnerabilities, such as misuse, security breaches, and \nother illegal uses, in digital technology. \n \n5.  As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to create uncertainty and as economies endeavor \nto shift from response to recovery, it is the right time to gather evidence on the effectiveness of \ninterventions that use financial technology. Future applications will be better informed about \nwhether to replicate, continue, modify, and/or scale up financial technology-related interventions.8 \n \n6.  While a few ADB-assisted projects have adopted advanced financial technology that can \nmake financial processes, such as payments to project beneficiaries, more efficient, discussions \nbetween project officers and government counterparts regarding its use are increasingly common. \nThe use of financial technology in ADB-assisted projects will benefit from reliable evidence on its \neffectiveness. Thus, the TA will select and support studies that will examine the use of advanced \nfinancial technology and draw lessons from these studies to inform the design of future ADB \nprojects. The TA will examine past or ongoing ADB projects that use financial technology and/or \npilot projects that can be considered for future ADB projects.9 \n \n7.  IE is essential for realizing ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 vision of becoming a leading knowledge \nprovider in Asia and the Pacific. The need for knowledge is especially high when it comes to new \ntechnologies. Thus, the TA will evaluate the use of financial technology, draw lessons to benefit \nthe design of ADB projects, and raise awareness of the possibilities and advantages it presents. \nThe TA will share the findings of the IE studies in reports and workshops to help improve the \ndevelopment and design of ADB investment projects that rely on financial technology in DMCs. \nPriority will be given to interventions relevant to COVID-19 management and recovery. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: development effectiveness of ADB projects \nusing financial technology enhanced. The impact also supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational \npriorities 1 and 2 (para. 2). The TA will have the following outcome: application of financial \ntechnology in ADB projects increased.10 \n \n \n \n \n \n7  Digital identification systems have been introduced recently in Cambodia, India, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. \n8  By conducting IE studies, this TA will identify constraints, such as ineffective regulatory frameworks, insufficient \nnetworks and infrastructure, and weaknesses in digital identification systems, for adopting financial technology in \ngovernment and ADB programs. \n9  For instance, the IE studies could be conducted with project teams before or during project implementation periods, \nand study findings could be included in knowledge and project reports. \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Impact evaluation studies on the use of financial technology conducted. \nThis output will support the conduct of at least three IE studies on the use of financial technology.11 \nThe IE studies will draw lessons to inform ADB operation teams and DMC officials as they develop \nfuture ADB-financed projects. The IE studies will be completed within the TA implementation \nperiod. This will require the design of proposed studies to rely on existing baseline surveys, use \nquasi-experimental methods, or adopt a nimble randomized control trial. Gender-differentiated \nanalysis will be conducted in at least one study. \n  \n10.  Output 2: Awareness on impact evaluation of financial technology enhanced. This \noutput will entail dissemination of IE results on financial technology and policy dialogue with DMC \nofficials. The TA will disseminate the information and knowledge generated to policy makers, \nresearchers,  ADB  operations  and  knowledge departments,  and  other  stakeholders through \nconferences, workshops, and webinars and other virtual platforms. Audiences will include, in \nparticular, policy makers, researchers, other relevant stakeholders in the countries of study, and \nrelevant ADB project teams. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nRepublic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  The Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund will finance operational \nexpenses  related  to  eligible  activities  indicated  in  Article  2  of  the  fund\u2019s  implementation \nguidelines.12 It will not be used for (i) civil works, (ii) procurement of large-scale equipment, (iii) \npermanent staffing costs, or (iv) hiring of staff consultants, unless otherwise agreed between the \nGovernment of the Republic of Korea and ADB. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. Implementation of the TA is expected to \ncommence in November 2020.13 Guidance and expertise will be provided by the Finance Sector \nGroup of the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDSC-FIN), wherein \nSDSC-FIN will ensure sector relevance. ERCD will ensure technical quality of data collection, \nanalysis, and knowledge products. \n \n14.  A call for expressions of interest will be made by ERCD to relevant ADB project teams on \npotential interventions for testing through IE. The selection of submissions will be based on cost-\neffectiveness, operational relevance, technical rigor, feasibility, and contribution to knowledge \ngaps. In addition, financial technology projects that are specifically targeted at youth, women, and \neconomically  challenged  groups  will  be  prioritized.  ERCD  staff  will  support  the  technical \ndevelopment of submissions and SDSC-FIN will be consulted on the selection of proposals. The \nselection process will consider gender-differentiated analysis along with relevance to COVID-19 \nmanagement and recovery.14 \n \n11 Examples include a study on financial technology loans for tricycle drivers in the Philippines and smart electricity \nmeter projects in India, Nepal, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \n12 ADB. 2019. Annual Report of the e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund 2018. Manila (Appendix 6). \n13 ADB-financed activities will only commence after receiving a no-objection from each participating DMC. \n14  At least one of the studies to be selected should conduct a gender-differentiated analysis. \n ", "4 \n \n15.  The results of the IE studies will be published as reports or as stand-alone working papers \nand disseminated at awareness events and policy dialogues. Each IE study will require a team of \nconsultants, both international and national, to be engaged separately.15 The consultants will (i) \nprovide technical guidance and feedback on the initial IE concept, (ii) develop the design of the \nIE  studies  together  with  ADB  project  teams,  (iii)  assist  in  guiding  and  overseeing  the \nimplementation of IE studies, (iv) assist in survey and sampling design, (v) implement the surveys, \nand (vi) assist in data analysis and report preparation. Because some findings from the selected \nstudies may be context specific, care will be taken in understanding which aspects can be \ngeneralized to other contexts and under what conditions. \n \n16.

ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated staff instructions.16 Although the \nexact requirements of the type of expertise and the length of their inputs will only be known during \nthe implementation of the individual studies, it is envisaged that the TA will require about 10 \nperson-months of international and 10 person-months of national consultant services. Given this \nlimitations and the intermittent nature of assignments and highly specialized expertise required, \nthe TA will primarily fulfill its consulting requirements by recruiting experts on an individual basis \nthrough either consultants\u2019 qualifications selection or the direct contracting method. Since there \nare only a few individuals with specialized expertise in IE and financial technology, the proposed \nselection methods are deemed justified. If the studies require involvement of a research institution, \nthe recruitment will be based on consultants\u2019 qualifications selection. On an exceptional basis, \nand where the project or study selections result in a country context where only one research \ninstitution can provide the required expertise, the recruitment will be conducted on a single-source \nselection  basis  or  using  the  direct  contracting  method.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. ADB will also engage experts, which could include ADB staff, as \nresource  persons  to  produce  knowledge  products  and  facilitate  workshops,  trainings,  and \nconferences. \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s  procurement.  ADB  will  engage  consultants  and  carry  out  procurement  (for \nconsulting services and equipment) following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and its associated staff instructions. Non-consulting services for separately \ncontracted data collection will be procured using open advertisement or request for quotation. \nProcurement of equipment will take place in coordination with ADB\u2019s Office of Information \nSystems and Technology and Office of Administrative Services. When the TA is completed, any \nprocured equipment will remain ADB property and/or will be disposed of in accordance with \nrelevant ADB guidelines. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the Asian \nDevelopment Bank administering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 \nto be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund \nfor Impact Evaluation of Financial Technology Innovations in Selected Developing Member \nCountries, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n16 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the TA is aligned with \nDevelopment effectiveness of ADB projects using financial technology enhanced (Strategy 2030: \n  Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific)a \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nOutcome  By 2023:     \nApplication of  At least 3 ADB finance sector  a.
